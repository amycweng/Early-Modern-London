Good day, gallants._All._ Good morrow, sweet Lodovico._Lod._ How dost thou, Carolo?_Car._ Faith, as the physicians do in a plague, see the worldsick, and am well myself._Fon._ Here’s a sweet morning, gentlemen._Lod._ Oh, a morning to tempt Jove from his ningle,[231]Ganymede; which is but to give dairy-wenches green gowns as theyare going a-milking. What, is thy lord stirring yet?[231] Favourite._Ast._ Yes, he will not be horsed this hour, sure._Ber._ My lady swears he shall, for she longs to be at court._Car._ Oh, we shall ride switch and spur; would we were thereonce._Enter_ BRYAN._Lod._ How now, is thy lord ready?_Bry._ No, so crees sa’ me, my lady will have some little tingin her pelly first._Car._ Oh, then they’ll to breakfast._Lod._ Footman, does my lord ride i’th’ coach with my lady, oron horseback?_Bry._ No, foot, la, my lady will have me lord sheet wid her, mylord will sheet in de one side, and my lady sheet in de toderside. [_Exit.__Lod._ My lady sheet in de toder side! Did you ever hear arascal talk so like a pagan? Is’t not strange that a fellow ofhis star, should be seen here so long in Italy, yet speak sofrom a Christian?_Enter_ ANTONIO, _with a book_._Ast._ An Irishman in Italy! that so strange! why, the nationhave running heads. [_They walk up and down.__Lod._ Nay, Carolo, this is more strange, I ha’ been in France,there’s few of them. Marry, England they count a warm chimneycorner, and there they swarm like crickets to the crevice of abrew-house; but sir, in England I have noted one thing._Ast._, _Ber._, _&c._ What’s that, what’s that of England?_Lod._ Marry this, sir,--what’s he yonder?_Ber._ A poor fellow would speak with my lord._Lod._ In England, sir,--troth, I ever laugh when I think on’t:to see a whole nation should be marked i’th’ forehead, as a manmay say, with one iron: why, sir, there all costermongers areIrishmen._Car._ Oh, that’s to show their antiquity, as coming from Eve,who was an apple-wife, and they take after the mother._Ast._, _Ber._, _&c._ Good, good! ha, ha!_Lod._ Why, then, should all your chimney-sweepers likewise beIrishmen? answer that now; come, your wit._Car._ Faith, that’s soon answered, for St. Patrick, you know,keeps purgatory; he makes the fire, and his countrymen could donothing, if they cannot sweep the chimneys._Ast._, _Ber._, _&c._ Good again._Lod._ Then, sir, have you many of them, like this fellow,especially those of his hair, footmen to noblemen andothers,[232] and the knaves are very faithful where they love.By my faith, very proper men many of them, and as active as theclouds,--whirr, hah![232] The running footmen of those days were generally Irishmen._Ast._, _Ber._, _&c._ Are they so?_Lod._ And stout! exceeding stout; why, I warrant, this preciouswild villain, if he were put to’t, would fight more desperatelythan sixteen Dunkirks.[233][233] Meaning Dunkirk privateers._Ast._ The women, they say, are very fair._Lod._ No, no, our country _buona-robas_,[234] oh! are thesugarest, delicious rogues![234] _Buona roba_ is an Italian phrase for a courtesan._Ast._ Oh, look, he has a feeling of them!_Lod._ Not I, I protest. There’s a saying when they commendnations. It goes, the Irishman for his hand, the Welshman for aleg, the Englishman for a face, the Dutchman for a beard._Fon._ I’faith, they may make swabbers of them._Lod._ The Spaniard,--let me see,--for a little foot, I take it;the Frenchman,--what a pox hath he? and so of the rest. Are theyat breakfast yet? come walk._Ast._ This Lodovico is a notable tongued fellow._Fon._ Discourses well._Ber._ And a very honest gentleman._Ast._ Oh! he’s well valued by my lord._Enter_ BELLAFRONT, _with a petition_._Fon._ How now, how now, what’s she?_Ber._ Let’s make towards her._Bell._ Will it be long, sir, ere my lord come forth?_Ast._ Would you speak with my lord?_Lod._ How now, what’s this, a nurse’s bill? hath any here gotthee with child and now will not keep it?_Bell._ No, sir, my business is unto my lord._Lod._ He’s about his own wife’s now, he’ll hardly dispatch twocauses in a morning._Ast._ No matter what he says, fair lady; he’s a knight, there’sno hold to be taken at his words._Fon._ My lord will pass this way presently._Ber._ A pretty, plump rogue._Ast._ A good lusty, bouncing baggage._Ber._ Do you know her?_Lod._ A pox on her, I was sure her name was in my table-bookonce; I know not of what cut her die is now, but she has beenmore common than tobacco: this is she that had the name of theHonest Whore._Ast._, _Ber._, _&c._ Is this she?_Lod._ This is the blackamoor that by washing was turned white:this is the birding-piece new scoured: this is she that, if anyof her religion can be saved, was saved by my lord Hippolito._Ast._ She has been a goodly creature._Lod._ She has been! that’s the epitaph of all whores. I’m wellacquainted with the poor gentleman her husband. Lord! whatfortunes that man has overreached! She knows not me, yet Ihave been in her company; I scarce know her, for the beauty ofher cheek hath, like the moon, suffered strange eclipses sinceI beheld it: but women are like medlars,--no sooner ripe butrotten:A woman last was made, but is spent first.Yet man is oft proved in performance worst._Ast._, _Ber._, _&c._ My lord is come._Enter_ HIPPOLITO, INFELICE, _and two~Waiting-women~_._Hip._ We ha’ wasted half this morning. Morrow, Lodovico._Lod._ Morrow, madam._Hip._ Let’s away to horse._Lod._, _Ast._, _&c._ Ay, ay, to horse, to horse._Bell._ I do beseech your lordship, let your eye read o’er thiswretched paper._Hip._ I’m in haste, pray thee, good woman, take some apter time._Inf._ Good woman, do._Bell._ Oh ’las! it does concern a poor man’s life._Hip._ Life! sweetheart?--Seat yourself, I’ll but read this andcome._Lod._ What stockings have you put on this morning, madam? ifthey be not yellow,[235] change them; that paper is a letterfrom some wench to your husband.[235] Yellow was typical of jealousy._Inf._ Oh sir, that cannot make me jealous.[_Exeunt all except_ HIPPOLITO, BELLAFRONT,_and_ ANTONIO._Hip._ Your business, sir? to me?_Ant._ Yes, my good lord._Hip._ Presently, sir.--Are you Matheo’s wife?_Bell._ That most unfortunate woman._Hip._ I’m sorry these storms are fallen on him; I love Matheo,And any good shall do him; he and IHave sealed two bonds of friendship, which are strongIn me, however fortune does him wrong.He speaks here he’s condemned. Is’t so?_Bell._ Too true._Hip._ What was he whom he killed? Oh, his name’s here;Old Giacomo, son to the Florentine;Giacomo, a dog, that to meet profit,Would to the very eyelids wade in bloodOf his own children. Tell Matheo,The duke, my father, hardly shall denyHis signèd pardon; ’twas fair fight, yes,If rumour’s tongue go true; so writes he here.--To-morrow morning I return from court,Pray be you here then.--I’ll have done, sir, straight:--  [_To_ ANTONIO.But in troth say, are you Matheo’s wife?You have forgot me._Bell._ No, my lord._Hip._ Your turner,That made you smooth to run an even bias,You know I loved you when your very soulWas full of discord: art not a good wench still?_Bell._ Umph, when I had lost my way to Heaven, you showed it:I was new born that day._Re-enter_ LODOVICO._Lod._ ’Sfoot, my lord, your lady asks if you have not left yourwench yet? When you get in once, you never have done. Come,come, come, pay your old score, and send her packing; come._Hip._ Ride softly on before, I’ll o’ertake you._Lod._ Your lady swears she’ll have no riding on before, withoutye._Hip._ Prithee, good Lodovico._Lod_. My lord, pray hasten._Hip._ I come.      [_Exit_ LODOVICO.To-morrow let me see you, fare you well;Commend me to Matheo. Pray one word more:Does not your father live about the court?_Bell._ I think he does, but such rude spots of shameStick on my cheek, that he scarce knows my name._Hip._ Orlando Friscobaldo, is’t not?_Bell._ Yes, my lord._Hip._ What does he for you?_Bell._ All he should: when childrenFrom duty start, parents from love may swerve;He nothing does: for nothing I deserve._Hip._ Shall I join him unto you, and restore you to wontedgrace?_Bell._ It is impossible._Hip._ It shall be put to trial: fare you well.      [_Exit_ BELLAFRONT.The face I would not look on! Sure then ’twas rare,When in despite of grief, ’tis still thus fair.Now, sir, your business with me._Ant._ I am boldT’express my love and duty to your lordshipIn these few leaves._Hip._ A book!_Ant._ Yes, my good lord._Hip._ Are you a scholar?_Ant._ Yes, my lord, a poor one._Hip._ Sir, you honour me.Kings may be scholars’ patrons, but, faith, tell me,To how many hands besides hath this bird flown,How many partners share with me?_Ant._ Not one,In troth, not one: your name I held more dear;I’m not, my lord, of that low character._Hip._ Your name I pray?_Ant._ Antonio Georgio._Hip._ Of Milan?_Ant._ Yes, my lord._Hip._ I’ll borrow leaveTo read you o’er, and then we’ll talk: till thenDrink up this gold; good wits should love good wine;This of your loves, the earnest that of mine.--      [_Gives money.__Re-enter_ BRYAN.How now, sir, where’s your lady? not gone yet?_Bry._ I fart di lady is run away from dee, a mighty deal ofground, she sent me back for dine own sweet face, I pray deecome, my lord, away, wu’t tow go now?_Hip._ Is the coach gone? Saddle my horse, the sorrel._Bry._ A pox a’ de horse’s nose, he is a lousy rascally fellow,when I came to gird his belly, his scurvy guts rumbled; di horsefarted in my face, and dow knowest, an Irishman cannot abide afart. But I have saddled de hobby-horse, di fine hobby is ready,I pray dee my good sweet lord, wi’t tow go now, and I will runto de devil before dee?_Hip._ Well, sir,--I pray let’s see you, master scholar._Bry._ Come, I pray dee, wu’t come, sweet face? Go. [_Exeunt._SCENE II.--_An Apartment in the_ DUKE’S _Palace_._Enter_ LODOVICO, CAROLO, ASTOLFO,_and_ BERALDO._Lod._ Godso’, gentlemen, what do we forget?_Car._, _Ast._, _Ber._ What?_Lod._ Are not we all enjoined as this day.--Thursday is’t not?Ay, as this day to be at the linen-draper’s house at dinner?_Car._ Signor Candido, the patient man._Ast._ Afore Jove, true, upon this day he’s married._Ber._ I wonder, that being so stung with a wasp before, hedares venture again to come about the eaves amongst bees._Lod._ Oh ’tis rare sucking a sweet honey comb! pray Heaven hisold wife be buried deep enough, that she rise not up to callfor her dance! The poor fiddlers’ instruments would crack forit, she’d tickle them. At any hand let’s try what mettle is inhis new bride; if there be none, we’ll put in some. Troth, it’sa very noble citizen, I pity he should marry again; I’ll walkalong, for it is a good old fellow._Car._ I warrant the wives of Milan would give any fellow twentythousand ducats, that could but have the face to beg of theduke, that all the citizens in Milan might be bound to the peaceof patience, as the linen-draper is._Lod._ Oh, fie upon’t! ’twould undo all us that are courtiers,we should have no whoop! with the wenches then._Enter_ HIPPOLITO._Car._, _Ast._, _Ber._ My lord’s come._Hip._ How now, what news?_Car._, _Ast._, _Ber._ None._Lod._ Your lady is with the duke, her father._Hip._ And we’ll to them both presently--_Enter_ ORLANDO FRISCOBALDO.Who’s that!_Car._, _Ast._, _Ber._ Signor Friscobaldo._Hip._ Friscobaldo, oh! pray call him, and leave me, we two havebusiness._Car._ Ho Signor! Signor Friscobaldo! The Lord Hippolito.[_Exeunt all but_ HIPPOLITO _and_ FRISCOBALDO._Orl._ My noble lord: my Lord Hippolito! the duke’s son! hisbrave daughter’s brave husband! how does your honoured lordship!does your nobility remember so poor a gentleman as SignorOrlando Friscobaldo! old mad Orlando!_Hip._ Oh, sir, our friends! they ought to be unto us as ourjewels, as dearly valued, being locked up, and unseen, as whenwe wear them in our hands. I see, Friscobaldo, age hath notcommand of your blood, for all Time’s sickle has gone over you,you are Orlando still._Orl._ Why, my lord, are not the fields mown and cut down, andstripped bare, and yet wear they not pied coats again? Though myhead be like a leek, white, may not my heart be like the blade,green?_Hip._ Scarce can I read the stories on your brow,Which age hath writ there; you look youthful still._Orl._ I eat snakes,[236] my lord, I eat snakes.[236] A supposed recipe for restoring youth.--_Dyce._My heart shall never have a wrinkle in it, so long as I can cry“Hem,” with a clear voice._Hip._ You are the happier man, sir._Orl._ Happy man? I’ll give you, my lord, the true picture of ahappy man; I was turning leaves over this morning, and found it;an excellent Italian painter drew it; if I have it in the rightcolours, I’ll bestow it on your lordship._Hip._ I stay for it._Orl._ He that makes gold his wife, but not his whore,He that at noon-day walks by a prison door,He that i’th’ sun is neither beam nor mote,He that’s not mad after a petticoat,He for whom poor men’s curses dig no grave,He that is neither lord’s nor lawyer’s slave,He that makes this his sea, and that his shore,He that in’s coffin is richer than before,He that counts youth his sword, and age his staff,He whose right hand carves his own epitaph,He that upon his deathbed is a swan,And dead, no crow--he is a happy man._Hip._ It’s very well; I thank you for this picture._Orl._ After this picture, my lord, do I strive to have my facedrawn: for I am not covetous, am not in debt; sit neither at theduke’s side, nor lie at his feet. Wenching and I have done; noman I wrong, no man I fear, no man I fee; I take heed how far Iwalk, because I know yonder’s my home; I would not die like arich man, to carry nothing away save a winding sheet: but likea good man, to leave Orlando behind me. I sowed leaves in myyouth, and I reap now books in my age. I fill this hand, andempty this; and when the bell shall toll for me, if I prove aswan, and go singing to my nest, why so! If a crow! throw me outfor carrion, and pick out mine eyes. May not old Friscobaldo, mylord, be merry now! ha?_Hip._ You may; would I were partner in your mirth._Orl._ I have a little, have all things. I have nothing; I haveno wife, I have no child, have no chick; and why should not I bein my jocundare?_Hip._ Is your wife then departed?_Orl._ She’s an old dweller in those high countries, yet notfrom me. Here, she’s here: but before me, when a knave and aquean are married, they commonly walk like serjeants together:but a good couple are seldom parted._Hip._ You had a daughter too, sir, had you not?_Orl._ O my lord! this old tree had one branch, and but onebranch growing out of it. It was young, it was fair, it wasstraight; I pruned it daily, dressed it carefully, kept itfrom the wind, helped it to the sun, yet for all my skill inplanting, it grew crooked, it bore crabs; I hewed it down;what’s become of it, I neither know, nor care._Hip._ Then I can tell you what’s become of it;That branch is withered._Orl._ So ’twas long ago._Hip._ Her name I think was Bellafront, she’s dead._Orl._ Ha? dead?_Hip._ Yes; what of her was left, not worth the keeping,Even in my sight was thrown into a grave._Orl._ Dead! my last and best peace go with her! I see Death’s agood trencherman, he can eat coarse homely meat, as well as thedaintiest._Hip._ Why, Friscobaldo, was she homely?_Orl._ O my lord! a strumpet is one of the devil’s vines; allthe sins, like so many poles, are stuck upright out of hell,to be her props, that she may spread upon them. And when she’sripe, every slave has a pull at her, then must she be pressed.The young beautiful grape sets the teeth of lust on edge, yet totaste that liquorish wine, is to drink a man’s own damnation. Isshe dead?_Hip._ She’s turned to earth._Orl._ Would she were turned to Heaven! Umph, is she dead? I amglad the world has lost one of his idols; no whoremonger will atmidnight beat at the doors. In her grave sleep all my shame, andher own; and all my sorrows, and all her sins!_Hip._ I’m glad you’re wax, not marble; you are madeOf man’s best temper; there are now good hopesThat all these heaps of ice about your heart,By which a father’s love was frozen up,Are thawed in these sweet showers, fetched from your eyes;We are ne’er like angels till our passion dies.She is not dead, but lives under worse fate;I think she’s poor; and more to clip her wings,Her husband at this hour lies in the jail,For killing of a man. To save his blood,Join all your force with mine: mine shall be shown:The getting of his life preserves your own._Orl._ In my daughter, you will say! does she live then? I amsorry I wasted tears upon a harlot; but the best is I have ahandkercher to drink them up, soap can wash them all out again.Is she poor?_Hip._ Trust me, I think she is._Orl._ Then she’s a right strumpet; I ne’er knew any of theirtrade rich two years together; sieves can hold no water, norharlots hoard up money; they have too many vents, too manysluices to let it out; taverns, tailors, bawds, panders,fiddlers, swaggerers, fools and knaves do all wait upon a commonharlot’s trencher: she is the gallipot to which these dronesfly, not for love to the pot, but for the sweet sucket[237]within it, her money, her money.[237] Preserve._Hip._ I almost dare pawn my word, her bosomGives warmth to no such snakes. When did you see her?_Orl._ Not seventeen summers._Hip._ Is your hate so old?_Orl._ Older; it has a white head, and shall never die till shebe buried: her wrongs shall be my bedfellow._Hip._ Work yet his life, since in it lives her fame._Orl._ No, let him hang, and half her infamy departs out of theworld: I hate him for her; he taught her first to taste poison;I hate her for herself, because she refused my physic._Hip._ Nay, but Friscobaldo!--_Orl._ I detest her, I defy[238] both, she’s not mine, she’s--[238] Renounce._Hip._ Hear her but speak._Orl._ I love no mermaids, I’ll not be caught with aquail-pipe.[239][239] Made use of by fowlers to allure quails._Hip._ You’re now beyond all reason._Orl._ I am then a beast. Sir, I had rather be a beast, and notdishonour my creation, than be a doting father, and like Time,be the destruction of mine own brood._Hip._ Is’t dotage to relieve your child, being poor?_Orl._ Is’t fit for an old man to keep a whore?_Hip._ ’Tis charity too._Orl._ ’Tis foolery; relieve her!Were her cold limbs stretched out upon a bier,I would not sell this dirt under my nailsTo buy her an hour’s breath, nor give this hair,Unless it were to choke her._Hip._ Fare you well, for I’ll trouble you no more._Orl._ And fare you well, sir. [_Exit_ HIPPOLITO.] Gothy ways; we have few lords of thy making, that love wenchesfor their honesty. ’Las my girl! art thou poor? poverty dwellsnext door to despair, there’s but a wall between them; despairis one of hell’s catch-poles; and lest that devil arrest her,I’ll to her. Yet she shall not know me; she shall drink of mywealth, as beggars do of running water, freely, yet never knowfrom what fountain’s head it flows. Shall a silly bird pick herown breast to nourish her young ones, and can a father see hischild starve? That were hard; the pelican does it, and shallnot I? Yes, I will victual the camp for her, but it shall be bysome stratagem. That knave there, her husband, will be hanged, Ifear; I’ll keep his neck out of the noose if I can, he shall notknow how._Enter two ~Serving-men~._How now, knaves? whither wander you?_1st Ser._ To seek your worship._Orl._ Stay, which of you has my purse? what money have youabout you?_2nd Ser._ Some fifteen or sixteen pounds, sir._Orl._ Give it me.--[_Takes purse._]--I think I have some goldabout me; yes, it’s well. Leave my lodging at court, and get youhome. Come, sir, though I never turned any man out of doors, yetI’ll be so bold as to pull your coat over your ears.[ORLANDO _puts on the coat of ~1st Serving-man~, andgives him in exchange his cloak_._1st Ser._ What do you mean to do, sir?_Orl._ Hold thy tongue, knave, take thou my cloak. I hope I playnot the paltry merchant in this bart’ring; bid the steward ofmy house sleep with open eyes in my absence, and to look to allthings. Whatsoever I command by letters to be done by you, seeit done. So, does it sit well?_2nd Ser._ As if it were made for your worship._Orl._ You proud varlets, you need not be ashamed to wearblue,[240] when your master is one of your fellows. Away! do notsee me.[240] The common livery of the time._Both._ This is excellent. [_Exeunt ~Serving-men~.__Orl._ I should put on a worse suit, too; perhaps I will. Myvizard is on; now to this masque. Say I should shave off thishonour of an old man, or tie it up shorter.Well, I will spoil a good face for once.My beard being off, how should I look? even likeA winter cuckoo, or unfeathered owl;Yet better lose this hair, than lose her soul.      [_Exit._SCENE III.--_A Room in_ CANDIDO’S _House_. CANDIDO, _the ~Bride~ and~Guests~ discovered at dinner; ~Prentices~ waiting on them_._Enter_ LODOVICO, CAROLO, _and_ASTOLFO._Cand._ O gentlemen, so late, you are very welcome, pray sitdown._Lod._ Carolo, did’st e’er see such a nest of caps?[241][241] In allusion to the caps worn both by traders and theirapprentices._Ast._ Methinks it’s a most civil and most comely sight._Lod._ What does he i’th’ middle look like?_Ast._ Troth, like a spire steeple in a country villageoverpeering so many thatched houses._Lod._ It’s rather a long pike-staff against so many bucklerswithout pikes;[242] they sit for all the world like a pair oforgans, and he’s the tall great roaring pipe i’ th’ midst.[242] Bucklers formerly had long spikes in their centre._Ast._ Ha, ha, ha, ha!_Cand._ What’s that you laugh at, signors?_Lod._ Troth, shall I tell you, and aloud I’ll tell it;We laugh to see, yet laugh we not in scorn,Amongst so many caps that long hat worn._1st Guest._ Mine is as tall a felt as any is this day in Milan,and therefore I love it, for the block[243] was cleft out for myhead, and fits me to a hair.[243] The model for the hat._Cand._ Indeed you’re good observers; it shows strange:But gentlemen, I pray neither contemn,Nor yet deride a civil ornament;I could build so much in the round cap’s praise,That ’bove this high roof, I this flat would raise._Lod._ Prithee, sweet bridegroom, do’t._Cand._ So all these guests will pardon me, I’ll do’t._Guests._ With all our hearts._Cand._ Thus, then, in the cap’s honour.To every sex, and state, both nature, time,The country’s laws, yea, and the very climeDo allot distinct habits; the spruce courtierJets[244] up and down in silk: the warriorMarches in buff, the clown plods on in gray:But for these upper garments thus I say,The seaman has his cap, pared without brim;The gallant’s head is feathered, that fits him;The soldier has his morion, women ha’ tires;Beasts have their head-pieces, and men ha’ theirs.[244] Struts._Lod._ Proceed._Cand._ Each degree has his fashion, it’s fit then,One should be laid by for the citizen,And that’s the cap which you see swells not high,For caps are emblems of humility.It is a citizen’s badge, and first was wornBy th’ Romans; for when any bondman’s turnCame to be made a freeman, thus ’twas said,He to the cap was called, that is, was madeOf Rome a freeman; but was first close shorn:And so a citizen’s hair is still short worn._Lod._ That close shaving made barbers a company,And now every citizen uses it._Cand._ Of geometric figures the most rare,And perfect’st, are the circle and the square;The city and the school much build uponThese figures, for both love proportion.The city-cap is round, the scholar’s square,To show that government and learning areThe perfect’st limbs i’ th’ body of a state:For without them, all’s disproportionate.If the cap had no honour, this might rear it,The reverend fathers of the law do wear it.It’s light for summer, and in cold it sitsClose to the skull, a warm house for the wits;It shows the whole face boldly, ’tis not madeAs if a man to look on’t were afraid,Nor like a draper’s shop with broad dark shed,For he’s no citizen that hides his head.Flat caps as proper are to city gowns,As to armours helmets, or to kings their crowns.Let then the city-cap by none be scorned,Since with it princes’ heads have been adorned.If more the round cap’s honour you would know,How would this long gown with this steeple[245] show?[245] A tall pointed hat satirized by Stubbes in his _Anatomieof Abuses_ (1538). Probably at this point Candido takes thesteeple-like hat worn by the 1st Guest, and puts it on his ownhead._All._ Ha, ha, ha! most vile, most ugly._Cand._ Pray, signor, pardon me, ’twas done in jest._Bride._ A cup of claret wine there._1st Pren._ Wine? yes, forsooth, wine for the bride._Car._ You ha’ well set out the cap, sir._Lod._ Nay, that’s flat._Cand._ A health!_Lod._ Since his cap’s round, that shall go round. Be bare,For in the cap’s praise all of you have share.[_They bare their heads and drink. As ~1st Prentice~ offers thewine to the ~Bride~, she hits him on the lips, breaking theglass._The bride’s at cuffs._Cand._ Oh, peace, I pray thee, thus far off I stand,I spied the error of my servants;She called for claret, and you filled out sack;That cup give me, ’tis for an old man’s back,And not for hers. Indeed, ’twas but mistaken;Ask all these else._Guests._ No faith, ’twas but mistaken._1st Pren._ Nay, she took it right enough._Cand._ Good Luke, reach her that glass of claret.Here mistress bride, pledge me there._Bride._ Now I’ll none. [_Exit.__Cand._ How now?_Lod._ Look what your mistress ails._1st Pren._ Nothing, sir, but about filling a wrong glass,--ascurvy trick._Cand._ I pray you, hold your tongue.--My servant there tells meshe is not well._Guests._ Step to her, step to her._Lod._ A word with you: do ye hear? This wench, your new wife,will take you down in your wedding shoes, unless you hang her upin her wedding garters._Cand._ How, hang her in her garters?_Lod._ Will you be a tame pigeon still? Shall your back be likea tortoise shell, to let carts go over it, yet not to break?This she-cat will have more lives than your last puss had, andwill scratch worse, and mouse you worse: look to’t._Cand._ What would you have me do, sir?_Lod._ What would I have you do? Swear, swagger, brawl, fling!for fighting it’s no matter, we ha’ had knocking pusses enowalready; you know, that a woman was made of the rib of a man,and that rib was crooked. The moral of which is, that a manmust, from his beginning be crooked to his wife; be you like anorange to her, let her cut you never so fair, be you sour asvinegar. Will you be ruled by me?_Cand._ In any thing that’s civil, honest, and just._Lod._ Have you ever a prentice’s suit will fit me?_Cand._ I have the very same which myself wore._Lod._ I’ll send my man for’t within this half hour, and withinthis two hour I’ll be your prentice. The hen shall not overcrowthe cock; I’ll sharpen your spurs._Cand._ It will be but some jest, sir?_Lod._ Only a jest: farewell, come, Carolo. [_Exeunt_LODOVICO, CAROLO, _and_ ASTOLFO._Guests._ We’ll take our leaves, sir, too._Cand._ Pray conceit not illOf my wife’s sudden rising. This young knight,Sir Lodovico, is deep seen in physic,And he tells me, the disease called the mother,[246]Hangs on my wife, it is a vehement heavingAnd beating of the stomach, and that swellingDid with the pain thereof cramp up her arm,That hit his lips, and brake the glass,--no harm,It was no harm![246] Hysteria._Guests._ No, signor, none at all._Cand._ The straightest arrow may fly wide by chance.But come, we’ll close this brawl up in some dance.      [_Exeunt._ACT THE SECOND.SCENE I.--_A Room in_ MATHEO’S _House_._Enter_ BELLAFRONT _and_ MATHEO.BELL. O my sweet husband! wert thou in thy grave and art aliveagain? Oh welcome, welcome!_Mat._ Dost know me? my cloak, prithee, lay’t up. Yes, faith,my winding-sheet was taken out of lavender, to be stuck withrosemary[247]: I lacked but the knot here, or here; yet if Ihad had it, I should ha’ made a wry mouth at the world like aplaice[248]: but sweetest villain, I am here now and I will talkwith thee soon.[247] Rosemary was used as an emblem of remembrance at bothfunerals and weddings.[248] A favourite simile with the writers of the time._Bell._ And glad am I thou art here._Mat._ Did these heels caper in shackles? Ah! my littleplump rogue. I’ll bear up for all this, and fly high. _Catsocatso._[249][249] _Ital._ A term of abuse or contempt._Bell._ Matheo?_Mat._ What sayest, what sayest? O brave fresh air! a pox onthese grates and gingling of keys, and rattling of iron. I’llbear up, I’ll fly high, wench, hang toff._Bell._ Matheo, prithee, make thy prison thy glass,And in it view the wrinkles, and the scars,By which thou wert disfigured; viewing them, mend them._Mat._ I’ll go visit all the mad rogues now, and the goodroaring boys.[250][250] Roystering young gallants. A highly favourable femaleversion of the type is given in Dekker and Middleton’s comedy,_The Roaring Girl_._Bell._ Thou dost not hear me?_Mat._ Yes, faith, do I._Bell._ Thou has been in the hands of misery, and ta’en strongphysic; prithee now be sound._Mat._ Yes. ’Sfoot, I wonder how the inside of a tavern looksnow. Oh, when shall I bizzle, bizzle?[251][251] _i.e._ Get a chance of drinking to excess._Bell._ Nay, see, thou’rt thirsty still for poison! Come, I willnot have thee swagger._Mat._ Honest ape’s face!_Bell._ ’Tis that sharpened an axe to cut thy throat.Good love, I would not have thee sell thy substanceAnd time, worth all, in those damned shops of hell;Those dicing houses, that stand never well,But when they stand most ill; that four-squared sinHas almost lodged us in the beggar’s inn.Besides, to speak which even my soul does grieve,A sort of ravens have hung upon thy sleeve,And fed upon thee: good Mat, if you please,Scorn to spread wing amongst so base as these;By them thy fame is speckled, yet it showsClear amongst them; so crows are fair with crows.Custom in sin, gives sin a lovely dye;Blackness in Moors is no deformity._Mat._ Bellafront, Bellafront, I protest to thee, I swear, asI hope for my soul, I will turn over a new leaf. The prison Iconfess has bit me; the best man that sails in such a ship, maybe lousy. [_Knocking within.__Bell._ One knocks at door._Mat._ I’ll be the porter: they shall see a jail cannot hold abrave spirit, I’ll fly high. [_Exit.__Bell._ How wild is his behaviour! Oh, I fearHe’s spoiled by prison, he’s half damned comes there,But I must sit all storms: when a full sailHis fortunes spread, he loved me: being now poor,I’ll beg for him, and no wife can do more._Re-enter_ MATHEO, _with_ ORLANDO _disguisedas a ~Serving-man~_._Mat._ Come in, pray! would you speak with me, sir?_Orl._ Is your name Signor Matheo?_Mat._ My name is Signor Matheo._Orl._ Is this gentlewoman your wife, sir?_Mat._ This gentlewoman is my wife, sir._Orl._ The Destinies spin a strong and even thread of both yourloves!--The mother’s own face, I ha’ not forgot that. [_Aside._]I’m an old man, sir, and am troubled with a whoreson salt rheum,that I cannot hold my water.--Gentlewoman, the last man I servedwas your father._Bell._ My father? any tongue that sounds his name,Speaks music to me; welcome, good old man!How does my father? lives he? has he health?How does my father?--I so much do shame him,So much do wound him, that I scarce dare name him.      [_Aside.__Orl._ I can speak no more._Mat._ How now, old lad, what dost cry?_Orl._ The rheum still, sir, nothing else; I should be wellseasoned, for mine eyes lie in brine. Look you, sir, I have asuit to you._Mat._ What is’t, my little white-pate?_Orl._ Troth, sir, I have a mind to serve your worship._Mat._ To serve me? Troth, my friend, my fortunes are, as a manmay say--_Orl._ Nay, look you, sir, I know, when all sins are old in us,and go upon crutches, that covetousness does but then lie inher cradle; ’tis not so with me. Lechery loves to dwell in thefairest lodging, and covetousness in the oldest buildings, thatare ready to fall: but my white head, sir, is no inn for such agossip. If a serving-man at my years, that has sailed about theworld, be not stored with biscuit enough to serve him the voyageout of his life, and to bring him East home, ill pity but allhis days should be fasting days. I care not so much for wages,for I have scraped a handful of gold together. I have a littlemoney, sir, which I would put into your worship’s hands, not somuch to make it more--_Mat._ No, no, you say well, thou sayest well; but I must tellyou,--how much is the money, sayest thou?_Orl._ About twenty pound, sir._Mat._ Twenty pound? Let me see: that shall bring thee in, afterten _per centum per annum_._Orl._ No, no, no, sir, no: I cannot abide to have moneyengender: fie upon this silver lechery, fie; if I may have meatto my mouth, and rags to my back, and a flock-bed to snort uponwhen I die, the longer liver take all._Mat._ A good old boy, i’faith! If thou servest me, thou shalleat as _I_ eat, drink as _I_ drink, lie as _I_ lie, and ride as_I_ ride._Orl._ That’s if you have money to hire horses. [_Aside.__Mat._ Front, what dost thou think on’t? This good old lad hereshall serve me._Bell._ Alas, Matheo, wilt thou load a backThat is already broke?_Mat._ Peace, pox on you, peace. There’s a trick in’t, I flyhigh, it shall be so, Front, as I tell you: give me thy hand,thou shalt serve me i’faith: welcome: as for your money--_Orl._ Nay, look you, sir, I have it here._Mat._ Pish, keep it thyself, man, and then thou’rt sure ’tissafe._Orl._ Safe! an’ twere ten thousand ducats, your worship shouldbe my cash-keeper; I have heard what your worship is, anexcellent dunghill cock, to scatter all abroad; but I’ll venturetwenty pounds on’s head. [_Gives money to_ MATHEO._Mat._ And didst thou serve my worshipful father-in-law, SignorOrlando Friscobaldo, that madman, once?_Orl._ I served him so long, till he turned me out of doors._Mat._ It’s a notable chuff[252]: I ha’ not seen him many a day.[252] See note _ante_, p. 99._Orl._ No matter an you ne’er see him; it’s an arrant grandee, achurl, and as damned a cut-throat._Bell._ Thou villain, curb thy tongue! thou art a Judas,To sell thy master’s name to slander thus._Mat._ Away, ass! He speaks but truth, thy father is a--_Bell._ Gentleman._Mat._ And an old knave. There’s more deceit in him than insixteen ’pothecaries: it’s a devil; thou mayest beg, starve,hang, damn! does he send thee so much as a cheese?_Orl._ Or so much as a gammon of bacon,He’ll give it his dogs first._Mat._ A jail, a jail._Orl._ A Jew, a Jew, sir._Mat._ A dog!_Orl._ An English mastiff, sir._Mat._ Pox rot out his old stinking garbage!_Bell._ Art not ashamed to strike an absent man thus?Art not ashamed to let this vile dog bark,And bite my father thus? I’ll not endure it.Out of my doors, base slave!_Mat._ Your doors? a vengeance! I shall live to cut that oldrogue’s throat, for all you take his part thus._Orl._ He shall live to see thee hanged first. [_Aside.__Enter_ HIPPOLITO._Mat._ God’s-so, my lord, your lordship is most welcome,I’m proud of this, my lord._Hip._ Was bold to see you.Is that your wife?_Mat._ Yes, sir._Hip._ I’ll borrow her lip. [_Kisses_ BELLAFRONT._Mat._ With all my heart, my lord._Orl._ Who’s this, I pray, sir._Mat._ My Lord Hippolito: what’s thy name?_Orl._ Pacheco._Mat._ Pacheco, fine name; thou seest, Pacheco, I keep companywith no scoundrels, nor base fellows._Hip._ Came not my footman to you?_Bell._ Yes, my lord._Hip._ I sent by him a diamond and a letter,Did you receive them?_Bell._ Yes, my lord, I did._Hip._ Read you the letter?_Bell._ O’er and o’er ’tis read._Hip._ And, faith, your answer?_Bell._ Now the time’s not fit,You see, my husband’s here._Hip._ I’ll now then leave you,And choose mine hour; but ere I part away,Hark you, remember I must have no nay--Matheo, I will leave you._Mat._ A glass of wine._Hip._ Not now, I’ll visit you at other times.You’re come off well, then?_Mat._ Excellent well. I thank your lordship: I owe you my life,my lord; and will pay my best blood in any service of yours._Hip._ I’ll take no such dear payment. Hark you, Matheo, I knowthe prison is a gulf. If money run low with you, my purse isyour’s: call for it._Mat._ Faith, my lord, I thank my stars, they send me down some;I cannot sink, so long these bladders hold._Hip._ I will not see your fortunes ebb, pray, try.To starve in full barns were fond[253] modesty.[253] Foolish._Mat._ Open the door, sirrah._Hip._ Drink this, and anon, I pray thee, give thy mistress this.[_Gives to_ FRISCOBALDO, _who opens the door, firstmoney, then a purse, and exit_._Orl._ O noble spirit, if no worse guests here dwell,My blue coat sits on my old shoulders well._Mat._ The only royal fellow, he’s bounteous as the Indies,what’s that he said to thee, Bellafront?_Bell._ Nothing._Mat._ I prithee, good girl?_Bell._ Why, I tell you, nothing._Mat._ Nothing? it’s well: tricks! that I must be beholden toa scald hot-livered goatish gallant, to stand with my cap inmy hand, and vail bonnet, when I ha’ spread as lofty sails ashimself. Would I had been hanged. Nothing? Pacheco, brush mycloak._Orl._ Where is’t, sir?_Mat._ Come, we’ll fly high.Nothing? There is a whore still in thy eye.      [_Exit.__Orl._ My twenty pounds fly high, O wretched woman!This varlet’s able to make Lucrece common.      [_Aside._How now, mistress? has my master dyed you into this sad colour?_Bell._ Fellow, begone I pray thee; if thy tongueItch after talk so much, seek out thy master.Thou’rt a fit instrument for him._Orl._ Zounds, I hope he will not play upon me!_Bell._ Play on thee? no, you two will fly together,Because you’re roving arrows of one feather.Would thou wouldst leave my house, thou ne’er shalt please me!Weave thy nets ne’er so high,Thou shalt be but a spider in mine eye.Thou’rt rank with poison, poison tempered wellIs food for health; but thy black tongue doth swellWith venom, to hurt him that gave thee bread:To wrong men absent, is to spurn the dead.And so did’st thou my master, and my father._Orl._ You have small reason to take his part; for I have heardhim say five hundred times, you were as arrant a whore as everstiffened tiffany neckcloths in water-starch upon a Saturday i’th’ afternoon._Bell._ Let him say worse, when for the earth’s offenceHot vengeance through the marble clouds is driven,Is’t fit earth shoot again those darts at heaven?_Orl._ And so if your father call you whore you’ll not call himold knave:--Friscobaldo, she carries thy mind up and down; she’sthine own flesh, blood, and bone. [_Aside_] Troth, mistress, totell you true, the fireworks that ran from me upon lines againstmy good old master, your father, were but to try how my youngmaster, your husband, loved such squibs: but it’s well known, Ilove your father as myself; I’ll ride for him at mid-night, runfor you by owl-light; I’ll die for him, drudge for you; I’ll flylow, and I’ll fly high, as my master says, to do you good, ifyou’ll forgive me._Bell._ I am not made of marble; I forgive thee._Orl._ Nay, if you were made of marble, a good stone-cuttermight cut you. I hope the twenty pound I delivered to my master,is in a sure hand._Bell._ In a sure hand, I warrant thee, for spending._Orl._ I see my young master is a mad-cap, and a _bonus socius_.I love him well, mistress: yet as well as I love him, I’llnot play the knave with you; look you, I could cheat you ofthis purse full of money; but I am an old lad, and I scornto cony-catch[254]: yet I ha’ been dog at a cony in my time.[_Gives purse._[254] Cheat._Bell._ A purse? where hadst it?_Orl._ The gentleman that went away, whispered in mine ear, andcharged me to give it you._Bell._ The Lord Hippolito?_Orl._ Yes, if he be a lord, he gave it me._Bell._ ’Tis all gold._Orl._ ’Tis like so: it may be, he thinks you want money, andtherefore bestows his alms bravely, like a lord._Bell._ He thinks a silver net can catch the poor;Here’s bait to choke a nun, and turn her whore.Wilt thou be honest to me?_Orl._ As your nails to your fingers, which I think neverdeceived you._Bell._ Thou to this lord shalt go, commend me to him,And tell him this, the town has held out long,Because within ’twas rather true than strong.To sell it now were base; Say ’tis no holdBuilt of weak stuff, to be blown up with gold.He shall believe thee by this token, or this;If not, by this.      [_Giving purse, ring and letters.__Orl._ Is this all?_Bell._ This is all._Orl._ Mine own girl still!      [_Aside.__Bell._ A star may shoot, not fall.      [_Exit.__Orl._ A star? nay, thou art more than the moon, for thou hastneither changing quarters, nor a man standing in thy circle witha bush of thorns. Is’t possible the Lord Hippolito, whose faceis as civil as the outside of a dedicatory book, should be amuttonmonger?[255] A poor man has but one ewe, and this grandeesheep-biter leaves whole flocks of fat wethers, whom he mayknock down, to devour this. I’ll trust neither lord nor butcherwith quick flesh for this trick; the cuckoo, I see now, singsall the year, though every man cannot hear him; but I’ll spoilhis notes. Can neither love-letters, nor the devil’s commonpick-locks, gold, nor precious stones make my girl draw up herpercullis?[256] Hold out still, wench.[255] Whoremonger.[256] Portcullis.All are not bawds, I see now, that keep doors,Nor all good wenches that are marked for whores.      [_Exit._SCENE II.--_Before_ CANDIDO’S _Shop_._Enter_ CANDIDO, _and_ LODOVICO _disguised asa ~Prentice~_._Lod._ Come, come, come, what do ye lack, sir? what do ye lack,sir? what is’t ye lack, sir? Is not my worship well suited? didyou ever see a gentleman better disguised?_Cand._ Never, believe me, signor._Lod._ Yes, but when he has been drunk. There be prenticeswould make mad gallants, for they would spend all, and drink,and whore, and so forth; and I see we gallants could make madprentices. How does thy wife like me? Nay, I must not be sosaucy, then I spoil all: pray you how does my mistress like me?_Cand._ Well; for she takes you for a very simple fellow._Lod._ And they that are taken for such are commonly thearrantest knaves: but to our comedy, come._Cand._ I shall not act it; chide, you say, and fret,And grow impatient: I shall never do’t._Lod._ ’Sblood, cannot you do as all the world does, counterfeit?_Cand._ Were I a painter, that should live by drawingNothing but pictures of an angry man,I should not earn my colours; I cannot do’t._Lod._ Remember you’re a linen-draper, and that if you giveyour wife a yard, she’ll take an ell: give her not therefore aquarter of your yard, not a nail._Cand._ Say I should turn to ice, and nip her loveNow ’tis but in the bud._Lod._ Well, say she’s nipt._Cand._ It will so overcharge her heart with grief,That like a cannon, when her sighs go off,She in her duty either will recoil,Or break in pieces and so die: her death,By my unkindness might be counted murder._Lod._ Die? never, never. I do not bid you beat her, nor giveher black eyes, nor pinch her sides; but cross her humours. Arenot baker’s arms the scales of justice? yet is not their breadlight? and may not you, I pray, bridle her with a sharp bit, yetride her gently?_Cand._ Well, I will try your pills,Do you your faithful service, and be readyStill at a pinch to help me in this part,Or else I shall be out clean._Lod._ Come, come, I’ll prompt you._Cand._ I’ll call her forth now, shall I?_Lod._ Do, do, bravely._Cand._ Luke, I pray, bid your mistress to come hither._Lod._ Luke, I pray, bid your mistress to come hither._Cand._ Sirrah, bid my wife come to me: why, when?[257][257] An expression signifying impatience._1st Pren._ [_Within_] Presently, sir, she comes._Lod._ La, you, there’s the echo! she comes._Enter ~Bride~.__Bride._ What is your pleasure with me?_Cand._ Marry, wife,I have intent; and you see this stripling here,He bears good will and liking to my trade,And means to deal in linen._Lod._ Yes, indeed, sir, I would deal in linen, if my mistresslike me so well as I like her._Cand._ I hope to find him honest, pray; good wife, look thathis bed and chamber be made ready._Bride._ You’re best to let him hire me for his maid.I look to his bed? look to’t yourself._Cand._ Even so?I swear to you a great oath--_Lod._ Swear, cry Zounds!--_Cand._ I will not--go to, wife--I will not--_Lod._ That your great oath?_Cand._ Swallow these gudgeons!_Lod._ Well said!_Bride._ Then fast, then you may choose._Cand._ You know at tableWhat tricks you played, swaggered, broke glasses, fie!Fie, fie, fie! and now before my prentice here,You make an ass of me, thou--what shall I call thee?_Bride._ Even what you will._Lod._ Call her arrant whore._Cand._ Oh fie, by no means! then she’ll call me cuckold.Sirrah, go look to th’ shop. How does this show?_Lod._ Excellent well--I’ll go look to the shop, sir.Fine cambrics, lawns; what do you lack?      [_Goes into the shop.__Cand._ A curst cow’s milk I ha’ drunk once before,And ’twas so rank in taste, I’ll drink no more.Wife, I’ll tame you._Bride._ You may, sir, if you can,But at a wrestling I have seen a fellowLimbed like an ox, thrown by a little man._Cand._ And so you’ll throw me?--Reach me, knaves, a yard!_Lod._ A yard for my master.[LODOVICO _returns from the shop with a yard-wand andfollowed by ~Prentices~_._1st Pren._ My master is grown valiant._Cand._ I’ll teach you fencing tricks._Prentices._ Rare, rare! a prize![258][258] A fencing contest. See note _ante_, p. 160._Lod._ What will you do, sir?_Cand._ Marry, my good prentice, nothing but breathe my wife._Bride._ Breathe me with your yard?_Lod._ No, he’ll but measure you out, forsooth._Bride._ Since you’ll needs fence, handle your weapon well,For if you take a yard, I’ll take an ell.Reach me an ell!_Lod._ An ell for my mistress! [_Brings an ell wand from theshop._ Keep the laws of the noble science, sir, and measureweapons with her; your yard is a plain heathenish weapon; ’tistoo short, she may give you a handful, and yet you’ll not reachher._Cand._ Yet I ha’ the longer arm.--Come fall to’t roundly,And spare not me, wife, for I’ll lay’t on soundly:If o’er husbands their wives will needs be masters,We men will have a law to win’t at wasters.[259][259] Cudgels._Lod._ ’Tis for the breeches, is’t not?_Cand._ For the breeches!_Bride._ Husband, I’m for you, I’ll not strike in jest._Cand._ Nor I._Bride._ But will you sign to one request?_Cand._ What’s that?_Bride._ Let me give the first blow._Cand._ The first blow, wife? shall I?_Lod._ Let her ha’t:If she strike hard, in to her, and break her pate._Cand._ A bargain: strike!_Bride._ Then guard you from this blow,For I play all at legs, but ’tis thus low.      [_Kneels._Behold, I’m such a cunning fencer grown,I keep my ground, yet down I will be thrownWith the least blow you give me: I disdainThe wife that is her husband’s sovereign.She that upon your pillow first did rest,They say, the breeches wore, which I detest:The tax which she imposed on you, I abate you;If me you make your master, I shall hate you.The world shall judge who offers fairest play;You win the breeches, but I win the day._Cand._ Thou win’st the day indeed, give me thy hand;I’ll challenge thee no more: my patient breastPlayed thus the rebel, only for a jest:Here’s the rank rider, that breaks colts; ’tis heCan tame the mad folks, and curst wives easily._Bride._ Who? your man?_Cand._ My man? my master, though his head be bare,But he’s so courteous, he’ll put off his hair._Lod._ Nay, if your service be so hot a man cannot keep his hairon, I’ll serve you no longer. [_Takes off his false hair.__Bride._ Is this your schoolmaster?_Lod._ Yes, faith, wench, I taught him to take thee down: I hopethou canst take him down without teaching;You ha’ got the conquest, and you both are friends._Cand._ Bear witness else._Lod._ My prenticeship then ends._Cand._ For the good service you to me have done,I give you all your years._Lod._ I thank you, master.I’ll kiss my mistress now, that she may say,My man was bound, and free all in one day.      [_Exeunt._ACT THE THIRD.SCENE I.--_An Apartment in_ HIPPOLITO’S _House_._Enter_ INFELICE, _and_ ORLANDO _disguised asa ~Serving-man~_.INF. From whom sayst thou?_Orl._ From a poor gentlewoman, madam, whom I serve._Inf._ And what’s your business?_Orl._ This madam: my poor mistress has a waste piece of ground,which is her own by inheritance, and left to her by her mother.There’s a lord now that goes about not to take it clean fromher, but to enclose it to himself, and to join it to a piece ofhis lordship’s._Inf._ What would she have me do in this?_Orl._ No more, madam, but what one woman should do for anotherin such a case. My honourable lord your husband, would do anything in her behalf, but she had rather put herself into yourhands, because you, a woman, may do more with the duke, yourfather._Inf._ Where lies this land?_Orl._ Within a stone’s cast of this place; my mistress, Ithink, would be content to let him enjoy it after her decease,if that would serve his turn, so my master would yield too; butshe cannot abide to hear that the lord should meddle with it inher lifetime._Inf._ Is she then married? why stirs not her husband in it?_Orl._ Her husband stirs in it underhand: but because the otheris a great rich man, my master is loath to be seen in it toomuch._Inf._ Let her in writing draw the cause at large:And I will move the duke._Orl._ ’Tis set down, madam, here in black and white already:work it so madam, that she may keep her own without disturbance,grievance, molestation, or meddling of any other; and shebestows this purse of gold on your ladyship._Inf._ Old man, I’ll plead for her, but take no fees:Give lawyers them, I swim not in that flood;I’ll touch no gold, till I have done her good._Orl._ I would all proctors’ clerks were of your mind, I shouldlaw more amongst them than I do then; here, madam, is thesurvey, not only of the manor itself, but of the grange-house,with every meadow, pasture, plough-land, cony-burrow, fish-pond,hedge, ditch, and bush, that stands in it. [_Gives a letter.__Inf._ My husband’s name, and hand and seal at armsTo a love letter? Where hadst thou this writing?_Orl._ From the foresaid party, madam, that would keep theforesaid land out of the foresaid lord’s fingers._Inf._ My lord turned ranger now?_Orl._ You’re a good huntress, lady; you ha’ found your gamealready: your lord would fain be a ranger, but my mistressrequests you to let him run a course in your own park. If you’llnot do’t for love, then do’t for money! she has no white money,but there’s gold; or else she prays you to ring him by thistoken, and so you shall be sure his nose will not be rootingother men’s pastures. [_Gives purse and ring.__Inf._ This very purse was woven with mine own hands;This diamond on that very night, when heUntied my virgin girdle, gave I him:And must a common harlot share in mine?Old man, to quit thy pains, take thou the gold._Orl._ Not I, madam, old serving-men want no money._Inf._ Cupid himself was sure his secretary;These lines are even the arrows love let flies,The very ink dropt out of Venus’ eyes._Orl._ I do not think, madam, but he fetched off some poet orother for those lines, for they are parlous hawks to fly atwenches._Inf._ Here’s honied poison! To me he ne’er thus writ;But lust can set a double edge on wit._Orl._ Nay, that’s true, madam, a wench will whet any thing, ifit be not too dull._Inf._ Oaths, promises, preferments, jewels, gold,What snares should break, if all these cannot hold?What creature is thy mistress?_Orl._ One of those creatures that are contrary to man; a woman._Inf._ What manner of woman?_Orl._ A little tiny woman, lower than your ladyship by head andshoulders, but as mad a wench as ever unlaced a petticoat: thesethings should I indeed have delivered to my lord, your husband._Inf._ They are delivered better: why should sheSend back these things?_Orl._ ’Ware, ’ware, there’s knavery._Inf._ Strumpets, like cheating gamesters, will not winAt first: these are but baits to draw him in.How might I learn his hunting hours?_Orl._ The Irish footman can tell you all his hunting hours,the park he hunts in, the doe he would strike; that Irishshackatory[260] beats the bush for him, and knows all; hebrought that letter, and that ring; he is the carrier.[260] A hound,--derived from “Shake a Tory.”_Inf._ Knowest thou what other gifts have passed between them?_Orl._ Little Saint Patrick knows all._Inf._ Him I’ll examine presently._Orl._ Not whilst I am here, sweet madam._Inf._ Be gone then, and what lies in me command. [_Exit_ORLANDO._Enter_ BRYAN._Inf._ How much cost those satins,And cloth of silver, which my husband sent by youTo a low gentlewoman yonder?_Bry._ Faat satins? faat silvers, faat low gentlefolks? dowpratest dow knowest not what, i’faat, la._Inf._ She there, to whom you carried letters._Bry._ By dis hand and bod dow saist true, if I did so, oh how?I know not a letter a’ de book i’faat, la._Inf._ Did your lord never send you with a ring, sir,Set with a diamond?_Bry._ Never, sa _crees_[261] fa’ me, never! he may run at atowsand rings i’faat, and I never hold his stirrup, till heleap into de saddle. By Saint Patrick, madam, I never touch mylord’s diamond, nor ever had to do, i’faat, la, with any of hisprecious stones.[261] _Críosd_--Christ._Enter_ HIPPOLITO._Inf._ Are you so close, you bawd, you pandering slave?[_Strikes_ BRYAN._Hip._ How now? why, Infelice; what’s your quarrel?_Inf._ Out of my sight, base varlet! get thee gone._Hip._ Away, you rogue!_Bry._ _Slawne loot_,[262] fare de well, fare de well. _Ahmarragh frofat boddah breen!_[263] [_Exit._[262] Irish: _Slán lúitheach_--A joyous farewell(?).[263] Irish: _As a márach frómhadh bodach bréan_--On the morrowof a feast, a clown is a beast._Hip._ What, grown a fighter? prithee, what’s the matter?_Inf._ If you’ll needs know, it was about the clock:How works the day, my lord, pray, by your watch?_Hip._ Lest you cuff me, I’ll tell you presently: I am near two._Inf._ How, two? I’m scarce at one._Hip._ One of us then goes false._Inf._ Then sure ’tis you,Mine goes by heaven’s dial, the sun, and it goes true._Hip._ I think, indeed, mine runs somewhat too fast._Inf._ Set it to mine at one then._Hip._ One? ’tis past:’Tis past one by the sun._Inf._ Faith, then, belike,Neither your clock nor mine does truly strike;And since it is uncertain which goes true,Better be false at one, than false at two._Hip._ You’re very pleasant, madam._Inf._ Yet not merry._Hip._ Why, Infelice, what should make you sad?_Inf._ Nothing, my lord, but my false watch: pray, tell me,--You see, my clock or yours is out of frame,Must we upon the workmen lay the blame,Or on ourselves that keep them?_Hip._ Faith on both.He may by knavery spoil them, we by sloth.But why talk you all riddle thus? I readStrange comments in those margins of your looks:Your cheeks of late are like bad printed books,So dimly charactered, I scarce can spellOne line of love in them. Sure all’s not well._Inf._ All is not well indeed, my dearest lord;Lock up thy gates of hearing, that no soundOf what I speak may enter._Hip._ What means this?_Inf._ Or if my own tongue must myself betray,Count it a dream, or turn thine eyes away,And think me not thy wife.      [_Kneels.__Hip._ Why do you kneel?_Inf._ Earth is sin’s cushion: when the sick soul feelsHerself growing poor, then she turns beggar, cries,And kneels for help: Hippolito, for husbandI dare not call thee, I have stolen that jewelOf my chaste honour, which was only thine,And given it to a slave._Hip._ Ha?_Inf._ On thy pillowAdultery and lust have slept, thy groomHath climbed the unlawful tree, and plucked the sweets,A villain hath usurped a husband’s sheets._Hip._ S’death, who?--a cuckold!--who?_Inf._ This Irish footman._Hip._ Worse than damnation! a wild kerne,[264] a frog,A dog: whom I’ll scarce spurn. Longed you for shamrock?Were it my father’s father, heart, I’ll kill him,Although I take him on his death-bed gasping’Twixt Heaven and hell! a shag-haired cur! Bold strumpet,Why hang’st thou on me? think’st I’ll be a bawdTo a whore, because she’s noble?[264] A rough sturdy fellow. Irish: _Ceithearneach_--A soldier._Inf._ I beg but this,Set not my shame out to the world’s broad eye,Yet let thy vengeance, like my fault, soar high,So it be in darkened clouds._Hip._ Darkened! my hornsCannot be darkened, nor shall my revenge.A harlot to my slave? the act is base,Common, but foul, so shall not thy disgrace.Could not I feed your appetite? O womenYou were created angels, pure and fair;But since the first fell, tempting devils you are,You should be men’s bliss, but you prove their rods:Were there no women, men might live like gods;You ha’ been too much down already; rise,Get from my sight, and henceforth shun my bed;I’ll with no strumpet’s breath be poisonèd.As for your Irish lubrican, that spiritWhom by preposterous charms thy lust hath raisedIn a wrong circle, him I’ll damn more blackThen any tyrant’s soul._Inf._ Hippolito!_Hip._ Tell me, didst thou bait hooks to draw him to thee,Or did he bewitch thee?_Inf._ The slave did woo me._Hip._ Tu-whoos in that screech-owl’s language. Oh, who’d trustYour cork-heeled sex? I think to sate your lust,You’d love a horse, a bear, a croaking toad,So your hot itching veins might have their bound:Then the wild Irish dart[265] was thrown? Come, how?The manner of this fight?[265] An allusion to the darts carried by the Irish runningfootmen.--_Dyce.__Inf._ ’Twas thus, he gave me this battery first.--Oh, IMistake--believe me, all this in beaten gold;Yet I held out, but at length thus was charmed.      [_Gives                                      letter, purse and ring._What? change your diamond, wench, the act is base,Common, but foul, so shall not your disgrace:Could not I feed your appetite? O men,You were created angels, pure and fair,But since the first fell, worse than devils you are.You should our shields be, but you prove our rods.Were there no men, women might live like gods.Guilty, my lord?_Hip._ Yes, guilty my good lady._Inf._ Nay, you may laugh, but henceforth shun my bed,With no whore’s leavings I’ll be poisonèd.      [_Exit.__Hip._ O’er-reached so finely? ’Tis the very diamondAnd letter which I sent: this villanySome spider closely weaves, whose poisonèd bulkI must let forth. Who’s there without?_Ser._ [_Within._] My lord calls?_Hip._ Send me the footman._Ser._ [_Within._] Call the footman to my lord,--Bryan,Bryan!_Hip._ It can be no man else, that Irish Judas,Bred in a country where no venom prospersBut in the nation’s blood, hath thus betrayed me._Re-enter_ BRYAN.Slave, get you from your service._Bry._ Faat meanest thou by this now?_Hip._ Question me not, nor tempt my fury, villainCouldst thou turn all the mountains in the land,To hills of gold, and give me: here thou stayest not._Bry._ I’faat, I care not._Hip._ Prate not, but get thee gone, I shall send else._Bry._ Ay, do predy, I had rather have thee make a scabbard ofmy guts, and let out all de Irish puddings in my poor belly, dento be a false knave to de, i’faat! I will never see dine ownsweet face more. _A mawhid deer a gra_,[266] fare dee well, faredee well; I will go steal cows again in Ireland. [_Exit._[266] Irish: _Maighisdir mo grádh_--Master of my love._Hip._ He’s damned that raised this whirlwind, which hath blownInto her eyes this jealousy: yet I’ll on,I’ll on, stood armed devils staring in my face,To be pursued in flight, quickens the race,Shall my blood-streams by a wife’s lust be barred?Fond[267] woman, no: iron grows by strokes more hard;Lawless desires are seas scorning all bounds,Or sulphur, which being rammed up, more confounds,Struggling with madmen madness nothing tames,Winds wrestling with great fires incense the flames.      [_Exit._[267] Foolish.SCENE II.--_A Room in Matheo’s House.__Enter_ BELLAFRONT, _and_ ORLANDO _disguised as a ~Serving-man~_._Bell._ How now, what ails your master?_Orl._ Has taken a younger brother’s purge, forsooth, and thatworks with him._Bell._ Where is his cloak and rapier?_Orl._ He has given up his cloak, and his rapier is bound to thepeace: If you look a little higher, you may see that anotherhath entered into hatband for him too. Six and four have put himinto this sweat._Bell._ Where’s all his money?_Orl._ ’Tis put over by exchange; his doublet was going to betranslated, but for me. If any man would ha’ lent but halfa ducat on his beard, the hair of it had stuffed a pair ofbreeches by this time; I had but one poor penny, and that I wasglad to niggle out, and buy a holly-wand to grace him throughthe street. As hap was, his boots were on, and them I dustied,to make people think he had been riding, and I had run by him._Bell._ Oh me!_Enter_ MATHEO.How does my sweet Matheo?_Mat._ Oh rogue, of what devilish stuff are these dice madeof,--the parings of the devil’s corns of his toes, that they runthus damnably?_Bell._ I prithee, vex not._Mat._ If any handicraft’s-man was ever suffered to keep shop inhell, it will be a dice-maker; he’s able to undo more souls thanthe devil; I played with mine own dice, yet lost. Ha’ you anymoney?_Bell._ ’Las, I ha’ none._Mat._ Must have money, must have some, must have a cloak, andrapier, and things. Will you go set your lime-twigs, and get mesome birds, some money?_Bell._ What lime-twigs should I set?_Mat._ You will not then? Must have cash and pictures, do yehear, frailty? shall I walk in a Plymouth cloak,[268] that’s tosay, like a rogue, in my hose and doublet, and a crabtree cudgelin my hand, and you swim in your satins? Must have money, come![_Taking off her gown._[268] _i.e._ With a staff._Orl._ Is’t bed-time, master, that you undo my mistress?_Bell._ Undo me? Yes, yes, at these riflings IHave been too often._Mat._ Help to flay, Pacheco._Orl._ Flaying call you it?_Mat._ I’ll pawn you, by th’ lord, to your very eyebrows._Bell._ With all my heart, since Heaven will have me poor,As good be drowned at sea, as drowned at shore._Orl._ Why, hear you, sir? i’faith do not make away her gown._Mat._ Oh! it’s summer, it’s summer; your only fashion for awoman now is to be light, to be light._Orl._ Why, pray sir, employ some of that money you have of mine._Mat._ Thine? I’ll starve first, I’ll beg first; when I touch apenny of that, let these fingers’ ends rot._Orl._ So they may, for that’s past touching. I saw my twentypounds fly high. [_Aside.__Mat._ Knowest thou never a damned broker about the city?_Orl._ Damned broker? yes, five hundred._Mat._ The gown stood me in above twenty ducats, borrow ten ofit. Cannot live without silver._Orl._ I’ll make what I can of it, sir, I’ll be your broker,--But not your damned broker: Oh thou scurvy knave!What makes a wife turn whore, but such a slave?      [_Aside and                                   exit with_ BELLAFRONT’S _gown_._Mat._ How now, little chick, what ailest, weeping for a handfulof tailor’s shreds? pox on them, are there not silks enow atmercer’s?_Bell._ I care not for gay feathers, I._Mat._ What dost care for then? why dost grieve?_Bell._ Why do I grieve? A thousand sorrows strikeAt one poor heart, and yet it lives. Matheo,Thou art a gamester, prithee, throw at all,Set all upon one cast. We kneel and pray,And struggle for life, yet must be cast away.Meet misery quickly then, split all, sell all,And when thou’st sold all, spend it; but I beseech theeBuild not thy mind on me to coin thee more,To get it wouldst thou have me play the whore?_Mat._ ’Twas your profession before I married you._Bell._ Umh? it was indeed: if all men should be brandedFor sins long since laid up, who could be saved?The quarter-day’s at hand, how will you doTo pay the rent, Matheo?_Mat._ Why? do as all of our occupation do against quarter-days:break up house, remove, shift your lodgings: pox a’ yourquarters!_Enter_ LODOVICO._Lod._ Where’s this gallant?_Mat._ Signor Lodovico? how does my little Mirror ofKnighthood?[269] this is kindly done i’faith: welcome, by mytroth.[269] An allusion to the well-known romance of this name, fromthe Spanish._Lod._ And how dost, frolic?--Save you fair lady.--Thou lookest smug and bravely, noble Mat._Mat._ Drink and feed, laugh and lie warm._Lod._ Is this thy wife?_Mat._ A poor gentlewoman, sir, whom I make use of a’nights._Lod._ Pay custom to your lips, sweet lady.      [_Kisses her.__Mat._ Borrow some shells[270] of him--some wine, sweetheart.[270] A cant term for money._Lod._ I’ll send for’t then, i’faith._Mat._ You send for’t?--Some wine, I prithee._Bell._ I ha’ no money._Mat._ ’Sblood, nor I.--What wine love you, signor?_Lod._ Here! (_Offering money_,) or I’ll not stay, Iprotest; trouble the gentlewoman too much? [_Gives money to_BELLAFRONT, _who goes out_.And what news flies abroad, Matheo?_Mat._ Troth, none. Oh signor, we ha’ been merry in our days._Lod._ And no doubt shall again.The divine powers never shoot darts at menMortal, to kill them._Mat._ You say true._Lod._ Why should we grieve at want? Say the world made theeHer minion, that thy head lay in her lap,And that she danced thee on her wanton knee,She could but give thee a whole world: that’s all,And that all’s nothing; the world’s greatest partCannot fill up one corner of thy heart.Say three corners were all filled, alas!Of what art thou possessed, a thin blown glass:Such as is by boys puffed into the air.Were twenty kingdoms thine, thou’dst live in care:Thou couldst not sleep the better, nor live longer,Nor merrier be, nor healthfuller, nor stronger.If, then, thou want’st, thus make that want thy pleasure,No man wants all things, nor has all in measure._Mat._ I am the most wretched fellow: sure some left-handedpriest hath christened me, I am so unlucky; I am never out ofone puddle or another; still falling._Re-enter_ BELLAFRONT _with wine_.                               Fill out wine to my little finger.With my heart, i’faith.      [_Drinks.__Lod._ Thanks, good Matheo.To your own sweet self.      [_Drinks.__Re-enter_ ORLANDO._Orl._ All the brokers’ hearts, sir, are made of flint. I canwith all my knocking strike but six sparks of fire out of them;here’s six ducats, if you’ll take them._Mat._ Give me them! [_Taking money._] An evil conscience gnawthem all! moths and plagues hang upon their lousy wardrobes!_Lod._ Is this your man, Matheo?_Mat._ An old serving-man._Orl._ You may give me t’other half too, sir, that’s the beggar._Lod._ What hast there,--gold?_Mat._ A sort of rascals are in my debt, God knows what, andthey feed me with bits, with crumbs, a pox choke them._Lod._ A word, Matheo; be not angry with me;Believe it that I know the touch of time,And can part copper though it be gilded o’er,From the true gold: the sails which thou dost spread,Would show well if they were not borrowèd.The sound of thy low fortunes drew me hither,I give my self unto thee; prithee, use me,I will bestow on you a suit of satin,And all things else to fit a gentleman,Because I love you._Mat._ Thanks, good, noble knight!_Lod._ Call on me when you please; till then farewell.      [_Exit.__Mat._ Hast angled? hast cut up this fresh salmon?_Bell._ Wouldst have me be so base?_Mat._ It’s base to steal, its base to be a whore:Thou’lt be more base, I’ll make thee keep a door.[271]      [_Exit._[271] _i.e._ Turn bawd._Orl._ I hope he will not sneak away with all the money, willhe?_Bell._ Thou sees’t he does._Orl._ Nay then, it’s well. I set my brains upon an uprightlast; though my wits be old, yet they are like a witheredpippin, wholesome. Look you, mistress, I told him I had but sixducats of the knave broker, but I had eight, and kept these twofor you._Bell._ Thou should’st have given him all._Orl._ What, to fly high?_Bell._ Like waves, my misery drives on misery. [_Exit.__Orl._ Sell his wife’s clothes from her back? does anypoulterer’s wife pull chickens alive? He riots all abroad,wants all at home: he dices, whores, swaggers, swears, cheats,borrows, pawns: I’ll give him hook and line, a little more forall this;Yet sure i’th end he’ll delude all my hopes,And show me a French trick danced on the ropes.      [_Exit._SCENE III.--_Before_ CANDIDO’S _Shop_. CANDIDO _and his ~Bride~discovered in the Shop_._Enter at one side_ LODOVICO _and_ CAROLO; _at another_ BOTS, _and_Mistress HORSELEECH._Lod._ Hist, hist, Lieutenant Bots, how dost, man?_Car._ Whither are you ambling, Madam Horseleech?_Mis. H._ About worldly profit, sir: how do your worships?_Bots._ We want tools, gentlemen, to furnish the trade: theywear out day and night, they wear out till no metal be left intheir back. We hear of two or three new wenches are come up witha carrier, and your old goshawk here is flying at them._Lod._ And, faith, what flesh have you at home?_Mis. H._ Ordinary dishes; by my troth, sweet men, there’s fewgood i’ th’ city; I am as well furnished as any, and, though Isay it, as well customed._Bots._ We have meats of all sorts of dressing; we have stewedmeat for your Frenchman, pretty light picking meat for yourItalian, and that which is rotten roasted for Don Spaniardo._Lod._ A pox on’t._Bots._ We have poulterer’s ware for your sweet bloods, as dove,chicken, duck, teal, woodcock, and so forth; and butcher’s meatfor the citizen: yet muttons[272] fall very bad this year.[272] Prostitutes._Lod._ Stay, is not that my patient linen-draper yonder, and myfine young smug mistress, his wife?_Car._ Sirrah,[273] grannam, I’ll give thee for thy fee twentycrowns, if thou canst but procure me the wearing of yon velvetcap.[273] See note _ante_, p. 124._Mis. H._ You’d wear another thing besides the cap. You’re a wag._Bots._ Twenty crowns? we’ll share, and I’ll be your pully todraw her on._Lod._ Do’t presently; we’ll ha’ some sport._Mis. H._ Wheel you about, sweet men: do you see? I’ll cheapenwares of the man, whilst Bots is doing with his wife._Lod._ To’t: if we come into the shop to do you grace, we’llcall you madam._Bots._ Pox a’ your old face, give it the badge of all scurvyfaces, a mask.[MISTRESS HORSELEECH _puts on a mask_._Cand._ What is’t you lack, gentlewoman? Cambric or lawns, orfine hollands? Pray draw near, I can sell you a pennyworth._Bots._ Some cambric for my old lady._Cand._ Cambric? you shall, the purest thread in Milan._Car._ Save you, Signor Candido._Lod._ How does my noble master? how my fair mistress?_Cand._ My worshipful good servant.--View it well, for ’tis bothfine and even. [_Shows cambric.__Car._ Cry you mercy, madam; though masked, I thought it shouldbe you by your man.--Pray, signor, show her the best, for shecommonly deals for good ware._Cand._ Then this shall fit her.--This is for your ladyship._Bots._ A word, I pray; there is a waiting gentlewoman of mylady’s: her name is Ruyna, says she’s your kinswoman, and thatyou should be one of her aunts._Bride._ One of her aunts? troth, sir, I know her not._Bots._ If it please you to bestow the poor labour of your legsat any time, I will be your convoy thither?_Bride._ I am a snail, sir, seldom leave my house. If’t pleaseher to visit me, she shall be welcome._Bots._ Do you hear? the naked truth is; my lady hath a youngknight, her son, who loves you, you’re made, if you lay holdupon’t; this jewel he sends you. [_Offers jewel.__Bride._ Sir, I return his love and jewel with scorn; let gomy hand, or I shall call my husband. You are an arrant knave.[_Exit.__Lod._ What will she do?_Bots._ Do? They shall all do if Bots sets upon them once: shewas as if she had professed the trade, squeamish at first; atlast I showed her this jewel, said a knight sent it her._Lod._ Is’t gold, and right stones?_Bots._ Copper, copper, I go a fishing with these baits.She nibbled, but would not swallow the hook, because theconger-head, her husband, was by; but she bids the gentlemanname any afternoon, and she’ll meet him at her gardenhouse,[274] which I know.[274] Gardens with summer-houses were very common in thesuburbs of London at the time, and were often used as places ofintrigue.--_Dyce.__Lod._ Is this no lie now?_Bots._ Damme, if--_Lod._ Oh, prithee stay there._Bots._ The twenty crowns, sir._Lod._ Before he has his work done? but on my knightly word heshall pay’t thee._Enter_ ASTOLFO, BERALDO, FONTINELL,_and_ BRYAN._Ast._ I thought thou hadst been gone into thine own country._Bry._ No, faat, la, I cannot go dis four or tree days._Ber._ Look thee, yonder’s the shop, and that’s the man himself._Fon._ Thou shalt but cheapen, and do as we told thee, to put ajest upon him, to abuse his patience._Bry._ I’faat, I doubt my pate shall be knocked: but, sa creessa’ me, for your shakes, I will run to any linen-draper in hell:come predee._Ast._, _Ber._, _Fon._ Save you, gallants._Lod._, _Car._ Oh, well met!_Cand._ You’ll give no more, you say? I cannot take it._Mis.

Sure your wife is slipt up, and the fourth man, Ihold my life, is grafting your warden tree.[276][276] Pear-tree._Cand._ Ha, ha, ha! you gentlemen are full of jest.If she be up, she’s gone some wares to show;I have above as good wares as below._Lod._ Have you so? nay, then--_Cand._ Now, gentlemen, is’t cambrics?_Bry._ I predee now let me have de best waures._Cand._ What’s that he says, pray, gentlemen?_Lod._ Marry, he says we are like to have the best wars._Cand._ The best wars? all are bad, yet wars do good,And, like to surgeons, let sick kingdom’s blood._Bry._ Faat a devil pratest tow so? a pox on dee! I preddee, letme see some hollen, to make linen shirts, for fear my body belousy._Cand._ Indeed, I understand no word he speaks._Car._ Marry, he says that at the siege in HollandThere was much bawdry used among the soldiers,Though they were lousy._Cand._ It may be so, that likely; true, indeed,In every garden, sir, does grow that weed._Bry._ Pox on de gardens, and de weeds, and de fool’s cap dere,and de clouts! hear? dost make a hobby-horse of me? [_Tearingthe cambric.__All._ Oh, fie! he has torn the cambric._Cand._ ’Tis no matter._Ast._ It frets me to the soul._Cand._ So does’t not me.My customers do oft for remnants call,These are two remnants, now, no loss at all.But let me tell you, were my servants here,It would ha’ cost more.--Thank you, gentlemen,I use you well, pray know my shop again._All._ Ha, ha, ha! come, come, let’s go, let’s go.

How am I suited, Front? am I not gallant, ha?_Bell._ Yes, sir, you are suited well._Mat._ Exceeding passing well, and to the time._Bell._ The tailor has played his part with you._Mat._ And I have played a gentleman’s part with my tailor, forI owe him for the making of it._Bell._ And why did you so, sir?_Mat._ To keep the fashion; it’s your only fashion now, of yourbest rank of gallants, to make their tailors wait for theirmoney; neither were it wisdom indeed to pay them upon the firstedition of a new suit; for commonly the suit is owing for, whenthe linings are worn out, and there’s no reason, then, that thetailor should be paid before the mercer._Bell._ Is this the suit the knight bestowed upon you?_Mat._ This is the suit, and I need not shame to wear it, forbetter men than I would be glad to have suits bestowed on them.It’s a generous fellow,--but--pox on him--we whose pericranionsare the very limbecks and stillatories of good wit and fly high,must drive liquor out of stale gaping oysters--shallow knight,poor squire Tinacheo: I’ll make a wild Cataian[278] of fortysuch: hang him, he’s an ass, he’s always sober.[278] A Cataian came to signify a sharper because thepeople of Cataia (China) were famous for their thievingpropensities.--_Dyce.__Bell._ This is your fault to wound your friends still._Mat._ No, faith, Front, Lodovico is a noble Slavonian: it’smore rare to see him in a woman’s company, than for a Spaniardto go into England, and to challenge the English fencersthere.--[_Knocking within._] One knocks,--see.--[_Exit_BELLAFRONT.]--La, fa, fol, la, fa, la, [_Sings_] rustlein silks and satins! there’s music in this, and a taffetapetticoat, it makes both fly high. _Catso.__Re-enter_ BELLAFRONT _with_ ORLANDO _in hisown dress, and four ~Servants~_._Bell._ Matheo! ’tis my father._Mat._ Ha! father? It’s no matter, he finds no tatteredprodigals here._Orl._ Is not the door good enough to hold your blue coats?[279]away, knaves, Wear not your clothes threadbare at knees for me;beg Heaven’s blessing, not mine.--[_Exeunt ~Servants~._]--Ohcry your worship mercy, sir; was somewhat bold to talk to thisgentlewoman, your wife here.[279] Serving-men’s livery at this time was usually blue._Mat._ A poor gentlewoman, sir._Orl._ Stand not, sir, bare to me; I ha’ read oftThat serpents who creep low, belch ranker poisonThan wingèd dragons do that fly aloft._Mat._ If it offend you, sir, ’tis for my pleasure._Orl._ Your pleasure be’t, sir. Umh, is this your palace?_Bell._ Yes, and our kingdom, for ’tis our content._Orl._ It’s a very poor kingdom then; what, are all yoursubjects gone a sheep-shearing? not a maid? not a man? not somuch as a cat? You keep a good house belike, just like one ofyour profession, every room with bare walls, and a half-headedbed to vault upon, as all your bawdy-houses are. Pray who areyour upholsters? Oh, the spiders, I see, they bestow hangingsupon you._Mat._ Bawdy-house? Zounds, sir--_Bell._ Oh sweet Matheo, peace. Upon my kneesI do beseech you, sir, not to arraign meFor sins, which Heaven, I hope, long since hath pardoned!Those flames, like lightning flashes, are so spent,The heat no more remains, than where ships went,Or where birds cut the air, the print remains._Mat._ Pox on him, kneel to a dog._Bell._ She that’s a whore,Lives gallant, fares well, is not, like me, poor.I ha’ now as small acquaintance with that sin,As if I had never known’t, t’ had never been._Orl._ No acquaintance with it? what maintains thee then? howdost live then? Has thy husband any lands? any rents coming in,any stock going, any ploughs jogging, any ships sailing? hastthou any wares to turn, so much as to get a single penny by?Yes thou hast ware to sell,Knaves are thy chapmen, and thy shop is hell._Mat._ Do you hear, sir?_Orl._ So, sir, I do hear, sir, more of you than you dream I do._Mat._ You fly a little too high, sir._Orl._ Why, sir, too high?_Mat._ I ha’ suffered your tongue, like a bard cater-tray,[280]to run all this while, and ha’ not stopt it.[280] A kind of false dice._Orl._ Well, sir, you talk like a gamester._Mat._ If you come to bark at her, because she’s a poor rogue,look you, here’s a fine path, sir, and there, there’s the door._Bell._ Matheo?_Mat._ Your blue coats stay for you, sir. I love a good honestroaring boy, and so--_Orl._ That’s the devil._Mat._ Sir, sir, I’ll ha’ no Joves in my house to thunderavaunt: she shall live and be maintained when you, like a keg ofmusty sturgeon, shall stink; where? in your coffin--how? be amusty fellow, and lousy._Orl._ I know she shall be maintained, but how? she like aquean, thou like a knave; she like a whore, thou like a thief._Mat._ Thief? Zounds! Thief?_Bell._ Good, dearest Mat!--Father!_Mat._ Pox on you both! I’ll not be braved. New satin scorns tobe put down with bare bawdy velvet. Thief?_Orl._ Ay, thief, th’art a murderer, a cheater, a whoremonger, apot-hunter, a borrower a beggar--_Bell._ Dear father--_Mat._ An old ass, a dog, a churl, a chuff, an usurer, avillain, a moth, a mangy mule, with an old velvet foot-cloth onhis back, sir._Bell._ Oh me!_Orl._ Varlet, for this I’ll hang thee._Mat._ Ha, ha, alas!_Orl._ Thou keepest a man of mine here, under my nose--_Mat._ Under thy beard._Orl._ As arrant a smell-smock, for an old muttonmonger[281] asthyself.[281] Whoremonger._Mat._ No, as yourself._Orl._ As arrant a purse-taker as ever cried, Stand! yet a goodfellow I confess, and valiant; but he’ll bring thee to th’gallows; you both have robbed of late two poor country pedlars._Mat._ How’s this? how’s this? dost thou fly high? robpedlars?--bear witness, Front--rob pedlars? my man and I a thief?_Bell._ Oh, sir, no more._Orl._ Ay, knave, two pedlars; hue and cry is up; warrants areout, and I shall see thee climb a ladder._Mat._ And come down again as well as a bricklayer or a tiler.How the vengeance knows he this? If I be hanged, I’ll tell thepeople I married old Friscobaldo’s daughter; I’ll frisco you,and your old carcass._Orl._ Tell what you canst; if I stay here longer, I shall behanged too, for being in thy company; therefore, as I found you,I leave you--_Mat._ Kneel, and get money of him._Orl._ A knave and a quean, a thief and a strumpet, a couple ofbeggars, a brace of baggages._Mat._ Hang upon him--Ay, ay, sir, farewell; we are--followclose--we are beggars--in satin--to him._Bell._ Is this your comfort, when so many yearsYou ha’ left me frozen to death?_Orl._ Freeze still, starve still!_Bell._ Yes, so I shall: I must: I must and will.If as you say I’m poor, relieve me then,Let me not sell my body to base men.You call me strumpet, Heaven knows I am none:Your cruelty may drive me to be one:Let not that sin be yours; let not the shameOf common whore live longer than my name.That cunning bawd, necessity, night and dayPlots to undo me; drive that hag away,Lest being at lowest ebb, as now I am,I sink for ever._Orl._ Lowest ebb, what ebb?_Bell._ So poor, that, though to tell it be my shame,I am not worth a dish to hold my meat;I am yet poorer, I want bread to eat._Orl._ It’s not seen by your cheeks._Mat._ I think she has read an homily to tickle the old rogue.[_Aside.__Orl._ Want bread! there’s satin: bake that._Mat._ ’Sblood, make pasties of my clothes?_Orl._ A fair new cloak, stew that; an excellent gilt rapier._Mat._ Will you eat that, sir?_Orl._ I could feast ten good fellows with these hangers.[282][282] The loops or straps appended to the girdle in which thedagger or small sword usually hung.--_Halliwell.__Mat._ The pox, you shall!_Orl._ I shall not, till thou begg’st, think thou art poor;And when thou begg’st I’ll feed thee at my door,As I feed dogs, with bones; till then beg, borrow,Pawn, steal, and hang, turn bawd, when th’art whore.--My heart-strings sure would crack, were they strained      more.      [_Aside, and exit.__Mat._ This is your father, your damned--Confusion light uponall the generation of you; he can come bragging hither with fourwhite herrings at’s tail in blue coats, without roes in theirbellies, but I may starve ere he give me so much as a cob.[283][283] Means both a herring and a piece of money._Bell._ What tell you me of this? alas!_Mat._ Go, trot after your dad, do you capitulate; I’ll pawn notfor you; I’ll not steal to be hanged for such an hypocritical,close, common harlot: away, you dog!--Brave i’faith! Udsfoot,give me some meat._Bell._ Yes, sir. [_Exit.__Mat._ Goodman slave, my man too, is galloped to the devila’ t’other side: Pacheco, I’ll checo you. Is this your dad’sday? England, they say, is the only hell for horses, and onlyparadise for women: pray get you to that paradise, becauseyou’re called an honest whore; there they live none but honestwhores with a pox. Marry here in our city, all your sex are butfoot-cloth nags,[284] the master no sooner lights but the manleaps into the saddle.[284] Horses with long housings._Re-enter_ BELLAFRONT _with meat and drink_._Bell._ Will you sit down I pray, sir?_Mat._ [_Sitting down._] I could tear, by th’ Lord, his flesh,and eat his midriff in salt, as I eat this:--must I choke--myfather Friscobaldo, I shall make a pitiful hog-louse of you,Orlando, if you fall once into my fingers--Here’s the savourestmeat! I ha’ got a stomach with chafing. What rogue should tellhim of those two pedlars? A plague choke him, and gnaw him tothe bare bones!--Come fill._Bell._ Thou sweatest with very anger, good sweet, vex not, as’tis no fault of mine._Mat._ Where didst buy this mutton? I never felt better ribs._Bell._ A neighbour sent it me._Re-enter_ ORLANDO _disguised as a ~Serving-man~_._Mat._ Hah, neighbour? foh, my mouth stinks,--You whore, do youbeg victuals for me? Is this satin doublet to be bombasted[285]with broken meat? [_Takes up the stool._[285] Stuffed out._Orl._ What will you do, sir?_Mat._ Beat out the brains of a beggarly--_Orl._ Beat out an ass’s head of your own--Away, Mistress[_Exit_ BELLAFRONT.] Zounds, do but touch one hair ofher, and I’ll so quilt your cap with old iron, that your coxcombshall ache like a roasted rabbit, that you must have the headfor the brains?_Mat._ Ha, ha! go out of my doors, you rogue, away, four marks;trudge._Orl._ Four marks? no, sir, my twenty pound that you ha’ madefly high, and I am gone._Mat._ Must I be fed with chippings? you’re bestget a clapdish,[286] and say you’re proctor to somespittle-house.[287] Where hast thou been, Pacheco? Come hithermy little turkey-cock.[286] The clap or clack-dish was properly a box carried bybeggars, the lid of which they used to rattle to attract noticeand bring people to their doors.[287] Hospital._Orl._ I cannot abide, sir, to see a woman wronged, not I._Mat._ Sirrah, here was my father-in-law to day._Orl._ Pish, then you’re full of crowns._Mat._ Hang him! he would ha’ thrust crowns upon me, to havefallen in again, but I scorn cast clothes, or any man’s gold._Orl._ But mine; [_Aside._]--How did he brook that, sir?_Mat._ Oh, swore like a dozen of drunken tinkers; at lastgrowing foul in words, he and four of his men drew upon me, sir._Orl._ In your house? would I had been by!_Mat._ I made no more ado, but fell to my old lock, and sothrashed my blue-coats and old crab-tree-face my father-in-law,and then walked like a lion in my grate._Orl._ O noble master!_Mat._ Sirrah, he could tell me of the robbing the two pedlars,and that warrants are out for us both._Orl._ Good sir, I like not those crackers._Mat._ Crackhalter, wou’t set thy foot to mine?_Orl._ How, sir? at drinking._Mat._ We’ll pull that old crow my father: rob thy master. Iknow the house, thou the servants: the purchase[288] is rich,the plot to get it is easy, the dog will not part from a bone.[288] Booty._Orl._ Pluck’t out of his throat, then: I’ll snarl for one, ifthis[289] can bite.[289] Meaning his sword._Mat._ Say no more, say no more, old coal, meet me anon at thesign of the Shipwreck._Orl._ Yes, sir._Mat._ And dost hear, man?--the Shipwreck. [_Exit.__Orl._ Th’art at the shipwreck now, and like a swimmer,Bold, but inexpert, with those waves dost play,Whose dalliance, whorelike, is to cast thee away._Enter_ HIPPOLITO _and_ BELLAFRONT.And here’s another vessel, better fraught,But as ill-manned her sinking will be wrought,If rescue come not: like a man of warI’ll therefore bravely out; somewhat I’ll do,And either save them both, or perish too.      [_Exit.__Hip._ ’Tis my fate to be bewitched by those eyes._Bell._ Fate? your folly.Why should my face thus mad you? ’Las, those coloursAre wound up long ago, which beauty spread;The flowers that once grew here, are witherèd.You turned my black soul white, made it look new,And should I sin, it ne’er should be with you._Hip._ Your hand, I’ll offer you fair play: When firstWe met i’th ’lists together, you rememberYou were a common rebel; with one parleyI won you to come in._Bell._ You did._Hip._ I’ll tryIf now I can beat down this chastityWith the same ordnance; will you yield this fort,If the power of argument now, as then,I get of you the conquest: as beforeI turned you honest, now to turn you whore,By force of strong persuasion?_Bell._ If you can,I yield._Hip._ The alarum’s struck up; I’m your man._Bell._ A woman gives defiance._Hip._ Sit.      [_They seat themselves.__Bell._ Begin:’Tis a brave battle to encounter sin._Hip._ You men that are to fight in the same warTo which I’m prest, and plead at the same bar,To win a woman, if you’d have me speed,Send all your wishes!_Bell._ No doubt you’re heard; proceed._Hip._ To be a harlot, that you stand upon,The very name’s a charm to make you one.Harlotta was a dame of so divineAnd ravishing touch, that she was concubineTo an English king;[290] her sweet bewitching eyeDid the king’s heart-strings in such love-knots tie,That even the coyest was proud when she could hearMen say, “behold, another harlot there!”And after her all women that were fairWere harlots called as to this day some are:Besides, her dalliance she so well does mix,That she’s in Latin called the _Meretrix_.Thus for the name; for the profession, this,Who lives in bondage, lives laced; the chief blissThis world below can yield, is liberty:And who, than whores, with looser wings dare fly?As Juno’s proud bird spreads the fairest tail,So does a strumpet hoist the loftiest sail,She’s no man’s slave; men are her slaves; her eyeMoves not on wheels screwed up with jealousy.She, horsed or coached, does merry journeys make,Free as the sun in his gilt zodiac:As bravely does she shine, as fast she’s driven,But stays not long in any house of heaven;But shifts from sign to sign, her amorous prizesMore rich being when she’s down, than when she rises.In brief, gentlemen hunt them, soldiers fight for them,Few men but know them, few or none abhor them:Thus for sport’s sake speak I, as to a woman,Whom, as the worst ground, I would turn to common:But you I would enclose for mine own bed.[290] Steevens pointed out that Arlotte was not the concubine ofan English king but was the mistress of the father of Williamthe Conqueror._Bell._ So should a husband be dishonourèd._Hip._ Dishonoured? not a whit: to fall to oneBesides your husband is to fall to none,For one no number is._Bell._ Faith, should you takeOne in your bed, would you that reckoning make?’Tis time you found retreat._Hip._ Say, have I won,Is the day ours?_Bell._ The battle’s but half done,None but yourself have yet sounded alarms,Let us strike too, else you dishonour arms._Hip._ If you can win the day, the glory’s yours._Bell._ To prove a woman should not be a whore,When she was made, she had one man, no more;Yet she was tied to laws then, for even than,[291]’Tis said, she was not made for men, but man.Anon, t’increase earth’s brood, the law was varied,Men should take many wives: and though they marriedAccording to that act, yet ’tis not knownBut that those wives were only tied to one.New parliaments were since: for now one womanIs shared between three hundred, nay she’s common,Common as spotted leopards, whom for sportMen hunt to get the flesh, but care not for’t.So spread they nets of gold, and tune their calls,To enchant silly women to take falls;Swearing they’re angels, which that they may winThey’ll hire the devil to come with false dice in.Oh Sirens’ subtle tunes! yourselves you flatter,And our weak sex betray: so men love water;It serves to wash their hands, but being once foul,The water down is poured, cast out of doors,And even of such base use do men make whores.A harlot, like a hen more sweetness reaps,To pick men one by one up, than in heaps:Yet all feeds but confounding. Say you should taste me,I serve but for the time, and when the dayOf war is done, am cashiered out of pay:If like lame soldiers I could beg, that’s all,And there’s lust’s rendezvous, an hospital.Who then would be a man’s slave, a man’s woman?She’s half starved the first day that feeds in common.[291] _i.e._ Then._Hip._ You should not feed so, but with me alone._Bell._ If I drink poison by stealth, is’t not all one?Is’t not rank poison still with you alone?Nay, say you spied a courtesan, whose soft sideTo touch you’d sell your birth-right, for one kissBe racked; she’s won, you’re sated: what follows this?Oh, then you curse that bawd that tolled you in;The night you curse your lust, you loathe the sin, You loathe her very sight, and ere the dayArise, you rise glad when you’re stol’n away.Even then when you are drunk with all her sweets,There’s no true pleasure in a strumpet’s sheets.Women whom lust so prostitutes to sale,Like dancers upon ropes, once seen, are stale._Hip._ If all the threads of harlot’s lives are spun,So coarse as you would make them, tell me whyYou so long loved the trade?_Bell._ If all the threadsOf harlot’s lives be fine as you would make them,Why do not you persuade your wife turn whore,And all dames else to fall before that sin?Like an ill husband, though I knew the sameTo be my undoing, followed I that game.Oh, when the work of lust had earned my bread,To taste it how I trembled, lest each bit,Ere it went down, should choke me chewing it!My bed seemed like a cabin hung in hell,The bawd, hell’s porter, and the liquorish wineThe pander fetched, was like an easy fine,For which, methought, I leased away my soul,And oftentimes, even in my quaffing bowl,Thus said I to myself, I am a whore,And have drunk down thus much confusion more._Hip._ It is a common rule, and ’tis most true,Two of one trade ne’er love: no more do you.Why are you sharp ’gainst that you once professed?_Bell._ Why dote you on that, which you did once detest?I cannot, seeing she’s woven of such bad stuff,Set colours on a harlot base enough.Nothing did make me, when I loved them best,To loathe them more than this: when in the streetA fair young modest damsel I did meet,She seemed to all a dove, when I passed by,And I to all a raven: every eyeThat followed her went with a bashful glance,At me each bold and jeering countenanceDarted forth scorn; to her as if she had beenSome tower unvanquished, would they vail,’Gainst me swoln rumour hoisted every sail.She, crowned with reverend praises, passed by them,I, though with face masked, could not ’scape the hem,For, as if Heaven had set strange marks on whores,Because they should be pointing stocks to man,Drest up in civilest shape, a courtesan--Let her walk saint-like, noteless, and unknown,Yet she’s betrayed by some trick of her own.Were harlots therefore wise, they’d be sold dear:For men account them good but for one year,And then like almanacs whose dates are gone,They are thrown by, and no more looked upon.Who’ll therefore backward fall, who will launch forthIn seas so foul, for ventures no more worth?Lust’s voyage hath, if not this course, this cross,Buy ne’er so cheap, your ware comes home with loss.What, shall I sound retreat? the battle’s done:Let the world judge which of us two have won._Hip._ I!_Bell._ You? nay then as cowards do in fight,What by blows cannot, shall be saved by flight.   [_Exit.__Hip._ Fly to earth’s fixèd centre: to the cavesOf everlasting horror, I’ll pursue thee,Though loaden with sins, even to hell’s brazen doors.Thus wisest men turn fools, doting on whores.   [_Exit._SCENE II.--_An Apartment in the_ DUKE’S _Palace_._Enter the_ DUKE, LODOVICO, _and_ ORLANDO, _disguised as a~Serving-man~; after them_ INFELICE, CAROLO, ASTOLFO, BERALDO, _and_FONTINELL._Orl._ I beseech your grace, though your eye be so piercing asunder a poor blue coat to cull out an honest father from anold serving-man, yet, good my lord, discover not the plot toany, but only this gentleman that is now to be an actor in ourensuing comedy._Duke._ Thou hast thy wish, Orlando, pass unknown,Sforza shall only go along with thee,To see that warrant served upon thy son._Lod._ To attach him upon felony, for two pedlars: is’t not so?_Orl._ Right, my noble knight: those pedlars were two knaves ofmine; he fleeced the men before, and now he purposes to flay themaster. He will rob me; his teeth water to be nibbling at mygold, but this shall hang him by th’ gills, till I pull him onshore._Duke._ Away: ply you the business._Orl._ Thanks to your grace: but, my good lord, for my daughter--_Duke._ You know what I have said._Orl._ And remember what I have sworn. She’s more honest, onmy soul, than one of the Turks’ wenches, watched by a hundredeunuchs._Lod._ So she had need, for the Turks make them whores._Orl._ He’s a Turk that makes any woman a whore; he’s no trueChristian, I’m sure. I commit your grace._Duke._ Infelice._Inf._ Here, sir._Lod._ Signor Friscobaldo._Orl._ Frisking again? Pacheco._Lod._ Uds so, Pacheco? we’ll have some sport with this warrant:’tis to apprehend all suspected persons in the house. Besides,there’s one Bots a pander, and one Madam Horseleech a bawd, thathave abused my friend; those two conies will we ferret into thepurse-net.[292][292] A net, the mouth of which was drawn together with a string._Orl._ Let me alone for dabbing them o’th’ neck: come, come._Lod._ Do ye hear, gallants? meet me anon at Matheo’s._Car._, _Ast._, _&c._ Enough. [_Exeunt_ LODOVICO _and_ORLANDO._Duke._ Th’ old fellow sings that note thou didst beforeOnly his tunes are, that she is no whore,But that she sent his letters and his gifts,Out of a noble triumph o’er his lust,To show she trampled his assaults in dust._Inf._ ’Tis a good honest servant, that old man._Duke._ I doubt no less._Inf._ And it may be my husband,Because when once this woman was unmasked,He levelled all her thoughts, and made them fit,Now he’d mar all again, to try his wit._Duke._ It may be so too, for to turn a harlotHonest, it must be by strong antidotes;’Tis rare, as to see panthers change their spots.And when she’s once a star fixed and shines bright,Though ’twere impiety then to dim her light,Because we see such tapers seldom burn,Yet ’tis the pride and glory of some men,To change her to a blazing star again,And it may be, Hippolito does no more.It cannot be but you’re acquainted allWith that same madness of our son-in law,That dotes so on a courtesan._All._ Yes, my lord._Car._ All the city thinks he’s a whoremonger._Ast._ Yet I warrant he’ll swear no man marks him._Ber._ ’Tis like so, for when a man goes a wenching, it is as ifhe had a strong stinking breath, every one smells him out, yethe feels it not, though it be ranker than the sweat of sixteenbear warders._Duke._ I doubt then you have all those stinking breaths, Youmight be all smelt out._Car._ Troth, my lord, I think we are all as you ha’ been inyour youth when you went a-maying, we all love to hear thecuckoo sing upon other men’s trees._Duke._ It’s well; yet you confess. But, girl, thy bedShall not be parted with a courtesan.’Tis strange,No frown of mine, no frown of the poor lady,My abused child, his wife, no care of fame,Of honour, heaven, or hell, no not that nameOf common strumpet, can affright, or woo himTo abandon her; the harlot does undo him;She has bewitched him, robbed him of his shape,Turned him into a beast, his reason’s lost;You see he looks wild, does he not?_Car._ I ha’ noted new moonsIn’s face, my lord, all full of change._Duke._ He’s no more like unto Hippolito,Than dead men are to living--never sleeps,Or if he do, it’s dreams: and in those dreamsHis arms work, and then cries, Sweet--what’s her name,What’s the drab’s name?_Ast._ In troth, my lord, I know not,I know no drabs, not I._Duke._ Oh, Bellafront!--And, catching her fast, cries, My Bellafront!_Car._ A drench that’s able to kill a horse, cannot kill thisdisease of smock smelling, my lord, if it have once eaten deep._Duke._ I’ll try all physic, and this medicine first:I have directed warrants strong and peremptoryTo purge our city Milan, and to cureThe outward parts, the suburbs, for the attachingOf all those women, who like gold want weight,Cities, like ships, should have no idle freight._Car._ No, my lord, and light wenches are no idle freight; butwhat’s your grace’s reach in this?_Duke._ This, Carolo. If she whom my son doats on,Be in that muster-book enrolled, he’ll shameEver t’approach one of such noted name._Car._ But say she be not?_Duke._ Yet on harlots’ headsNew laws shall fall so heavy, and such blows shallGive to those that haunt them, that HippolitoIf not for fear of law, for love to her,If he love truly, shall her bed forbear._Car._ Attach all the light heels i’th’ city, and clap ’em up?why, my lord, you dive into a well unsearchable: all the whoreswithin the walls, and without the walls? I would not be heshould meddle with them for ten such dukedoms; the army that youspeak on is able to fill all the prisons within this city, andto leave not a drinking room in any tavern besides._Duke._ Those only shall be caught that are of note;Harlots in each street flow:The fish being thus i’th net, ourself will sit,And with eye most severe dispose of it.Come, girl.      [_Exeunt_ DUKE _and_ INFELICE._Car._ Arraign the poor whores!_Ast._ I’ll not miss that sessions._Font._ Nor I._Ber._ Nor I, though I hold up my hand there myself. [_Exeunt._SCENE III.--_A Room in_ MATHEO’S _House_._Enter_ MATHEO, LODOVICO, _and_ ORLANDO _disguised as a ~Serving-man~_._Mat._ Let who will come, my noble chevalier, I can but play thekind host, and bid ’em welcome._Lod._ We’ll trouble your house, Matheo, but as Dutchmen do intaverns, drink, be merry, and be gone._Orl._ Indeed, if you be right Dutchmen, if you fall todrinking, you must be gone._Mat._ The worst is, my wife is not at home; but we’ll fly high,my generous knight, for all that: there’s no music when a womanis in the concert._Orl._ No; for she’s like a pair of virginals,Always with jacks at her tail._Enter_ ASTOLFO, CAROLO, BERALDO_and_ FONTINELL._Lod._ See, the covey is sprung._Ast._, _Car._, _&c._ Save you, gallants._Mat._ Happily encountered, sweet bloods._Lod._ Gentlemen, you all know Signor Candido, the linen-draper,he that’s more patient than a brown baker, upon the day when heheats his oven, and has forty scolds about him._Ast._, _Car._, _&c._ Yes, we know him all, what of him?_Lod._ Would it not be a good fit of mirth, to make a piece ofEnglish cloth of him, and to stretch him on the tenters, tillthe threads of his own natural humour crack, by making him drinkhealths, tobacco,[293] dance, sing bawdy songs, or to run anybias according as we think good to cast him?[293] To drink tobacco was a common phrase for smokingit.--_Reed.__Car._ ’Twere a morris-dance worth the seeing._Ast._ But the old fox is so crafty, we shall hardly hunt himout of his den._Mat._ To that train I ha’ given fire already; and the hook todraw him hither, is to see certain pieces of lawn, which Itold him I have to sell, and indeed have such; fetch them down,Pacheco._Orl._ Yes, sir, I’m your water-spaniel, and will fetch anything--but I’ll fetch one dish of meat anon shall turn yourstomach, and that’s a constable. [_Aside and exit.__Enter_ BOTS _ushering in ~Mistress~_HORSELEECH._Ast._, _Ber._, _Fon._ How now? how now?_Car._ What gally-foist[294] is this?[294] A long barge with oars._Lod._ Peace, two dishes of stewed prunes,[295] a bawd and apander. My worthy lieutenant Bots; why, now I see thou’rt aman of thy word, welcome.--Welcome Mistress Horseleech: pray,gentlemen, salute this reverend matron.[295] A common dish in the brothels of the time._Mis. H._ Thanks to all your worships._Lod._ I bade a drawer send in wine, too: did none come alongwith thee, grannam, but the lieutenant?_Mis. H._ None came along with me but Bots, if it like yourworship._Bots._ Who the pox should come along with you but Bots._Enter two ~Vintners~ with wine.__Ast._, _Car._, _&c._ Oh brave! march fair._Lod._ Are you come? that’s well._Mat._ Here’s ordnance able to sack a city._Lod._ Come, repeat, read this inventory._1st Vint._ _Imprimis_, a pottle of Greek wine, a pottle ofPeter-sameene,[296] a pottle of Charnico,[297] and a pottle ofLeatica.[298][296] A corruption of Pedro Ximenes, a sweet Spanish wine, socalled from the grape of that name.[297] A sweet Portuguese wine from the neighbourhood of Lisbon.[298] _i.e._ Aleatico, a red Italian muscatel wine with a richaromatic flavour._Lod._ You’re paid?_2nd Vint._ Yes, Sir. [_Exeunt ~Vintners~.__Mat._ So shall some of us be anon, I fear._Bots._ Here’s a hot day towards: but zounds, this is the lifeout of which a soldier sucks sweetness! when this artillery goesoff roundly, some must drop to the ground: cannon, demi-cannon,saker, and basilisk.[299][299] The saker and basilisk were both pieces of ordnance._Lod._ Give fire, lieutenant._Bots._ So, so: Must I venture first upon the breach? to youall, gallants: Bots sets upon you all. [_Drinks.__Ast._, _Car._, _&c._ It’s hard, Bots, if we pepper not you, aswell as you pepper us._Enter_ CANDIDO._Lod._ My noble linen-draper!--some wine!--Welcome old lad!_Mat._ You’re welcome, signor._Cand._ These lawns, sir?_Mat._ Presently; my man is gone for them: we ha’ rigged afleet, you see here, to sail about the world._Cand._ A dangerous voyage, sailing in such ships._Bots._ There’s no casting over board yet._Lod._ Because you are an old lady, I will have you beacquainted with this grave citizen, pray bestow your lips uponhim, and bid him welcome._Mis. H._ Any citizen shall be most welcome to me:--I have usedto buy ware at your shop._Cand._ It may be so, good madam._Mis. H._ Your prentices know my dealings well; I trust yourgood wife be in good case: if it please you, bear her a tokenfrom my lips, by word of mouth. [_Kisses him.__Cand._ I pray no more; forsooth, ’tis very well,Indeed I love no sweetmeats:--Sh’as a breathStinks worse than fifty polecats. [_Aside._] Sir, a word,Is she a lady?_Lod._ A woman of a good house, and an ancient, she’s a bawd._Cand._ A bawd? Sir, I’ll steal hence, and see your lawnsSome other time._Mat._ Steal out of such company? Pacheco, my man is but gonefor ’em: Lieutenant Bots, drink to this worthy old fellow, andteach him to fly high._Lod._, _Ast._, _&c._ Swagger: and make him do’t on his knees._Cand._ How, Bots? now bless me, what do I with Bots?No wine in sooth, no wine, good Master Bots._Bots._ Gray-beard, goat’s pizzle: ’tis a health, have this inyour guts, or this, there [_Touching his sword._] I will sing abawdy song, sir, because your verjuice face is melancholy, tomake liquor go down glib. Will you fall on your marrowbones, andpledge this health? ’Tis to my mistress, a whore._Cand._ Here’s ratsbane upon ratsbane, Master Bots;I pray, sir, pardon me: you are a soldier,Press me not to this service, I am old,And shoot not in such pot-guns.[300][300] A play upon “pop-guns.”_Bots._ Cap. I’ll teach you._Cand._ To drink healths, is to drink sickness--gentlemen.Pray rescue me._Bots._ Zounds, who dare?_Lod._, _Ast._, _&c._ We shall ha’ stabbing then?_Cand._ I ha’ reckonings to cast up, good Master Bots._Bots._ This will make you cast ’em up better._Lod._ Why does your hand shake so?_Cand._ The palsy, signor, danceth in my blood._Bots._ Pipe with a pox, sir, then, or I’ll make your blooddance--_Cand._ Hold, hold, good Master Bots, I drink. [_Kneels._[301][301] It was a common custom to kneel when drinking a health,especially the health of a superior._Ast._, _Lod._, _&c._ To whom?_Cand._ To the old countess there. [_Drinks.__Mis. H._ To me, old boy? this is he that never drunk wine!Once again to’t._Cand._ With much ado the poison is got down,Though I can scarce get up; never beforeDrank I a whore’s health, nor will never more._Re-enter_ ORLANDO _with lawns_._Mat._ Hast been at gallows?_Orl._ Yes, sir, for I make account to suffer to day._Mat._ Look, signor; here’s the commodity._Cand._ Your price?_Mat._ Thus.[302][302] The price was here probably indicated by displaying thefingers._Cand._ No: too dear: thus._Mat._ No: O fie, you must fly higher: yet take ’em home,trifles shall not make us quarrel, we’ll agree, you shall havethem, and a pennyworth; I’ll fetch money at your shop._Cand._ Be it so, good signor, send me going._Mat._ Going? a deep bowl of wine for Signor Candido._Orl._ He would be going._Cand._ I’ll rather stay than go so: stop your bowl._Enter ~Constable~ and ~Billmen~.__Lod._ How now?_Bots._ Is’t Shrove-Tuesday, that these ghosts walk?[303][303] On Shrove Tuesday the authorities made a search forbrothel-keepers, and on the same day the London apprentices wentabout wrecking houses of ill-fame._Mat._ What’s your business, sir?_Const._ From the duke: you are the man we look for, signor. Ihave warrant here from the duke, to apprehend you upon felonyfor robbing two pedlars: I charge you i’th’ duke’s name goquickly._Mat._ Is the wind turned? Well: this is that old wolf, myfather-in-law:--seek out your mistress, sirrah._Orl._ Yes, Sir,--as shafts by piecing are made strong,So shall thy life be straightened by this wrong.      [_Aside and exit.__Lod._, _Ast._, _&c._ In troth, we are sorry._Mat._ Brave men must be crossed; pish, it’s but fortune’s diceroving against me. Come, sir, pray use me like a gentleman; letme not be carried through the streets like a pageant._Const._ If these gentlemen please, you shall go along with them._Lod._, _Ast._, _&c._ Be’t so: come._Const._ What are you, sir?_Bots._ I, sir? sometimes a figure, sometimes a cipher, as theState has occasion to cast up her accounts: I’m a soldier._Const._ Your name is Bots, is’t not?_Bots._ Bots is my name; Bots is known to this company._Const._ I know you are, sir: what’s she?_Bots._ A gentlewoman, my mother._Const._ Take ’em both along._Bots._ Me, sir?_Billmen._ Ay, sir!_Const._ If he swagger, raise the street._Bots._ Gentlemen, gentlemen, whither will you drag us?_Lod._ To the garden house. Bots, are we even with you?_Const._ To Bridewell with ’em._Bots._ You will answer this._Const._ Better than a challenge. I’ve warrant for my work, sir._Lod._ We’ll go before._Const._ Pray do.--[_Exeunt_ MATHEO _with_ LODOVICO,ASTOLFO, CAROLO, BERALDO,_and_ FONTINELL; BOTS _and ~Mistress~_HORSELEECH, _with_ BILLMEN.Who, Signor Candido? a citizenOf your degree consorted thus, and revellingIn such a house?_Cand._ Why, sir? what house, I pray?_Const._ Lewd, and defamed._Cand._ Is’t so? thanks, sir: I’m gone._Const._ What have you there?_Cand._ Lawns which I bought, sir, of the gentleman that keepsthe house._Const._ And I have warrant here,To search for such stol’n ware: these lawns are stol’n._Cand._ Indeed!_Const._ So he’s the thief, you the receiver:I’m sorry for this chance, I must commit you._Cand._ Me, sir, for what?_Const._ These goods are found upon you,And you must answer’t._Cand._ Must I so?_Const._ Most certain._Cand._ I’ll send for bail._Const._ I dare not: yet becauseYou are a citizen of worth, you shall notBe made a pointing stock, but without guard,Pass only with myself._Cand._ To Bridewell too?_Const._ No remedy._Cand._ Yes, patience: being not mad,They had me once to Bedlam, now I’m drawnTo Bridewell, loving no whores._Const._ You will buy lawn!      [_Exeunt._ACT THE FIFTH.SCENE I.--_A Street.__Enter at one side_ HIPPOLITO; _at the other_, LODOVICO, ASTOLFO,CAROLO, BERALDO _and_ FONTINELL.LOD. Yonder’s the Lord Hippolito; by any means leave him and metogether; now will I turn him to a madman._Ast._, _Car._, _&c._ Save you my lord.[_Exeunt all except_ HIPPOLITO _and_ LODOVICO._Lod._ I ha’ strange news to tell you._Hip._ What are they?_Lod._ Your mare’s i’th’ pound._Hip._ How’s this?_Lod._ Your nightingale is in a limebush._Hip._ Ha?_Lod._ Your puritanical honest whore sits in a blue gown.[304][304] It was in a blue gown that strumpets had to do penance._Hip._ Blue gown!_Lod._ She’ll chalk out your way to her now: she beats chalk._Hip._ Where? who dares?--_Lod._ Do you know the brick-house of castigation, by the riverside[305] that runs by Milan,--the school where they pronounceno letter well but O?[305] Meaning Bridewell, where loose women were whipped._Hip._ I know it not._Lod._ Any man that has borne office of constable, or any womanthat has fallen from a horse-load to a cart-load,[306] or likean old hen that has had none but rotten eggs in her nest, candirect you to her: there you shall see your punk amongst herback-friends.[306] An allusion to the carting of prostitutes, who were at thesame time pelted by the populace with rotten eggs.There you may have her at your will,For there she beats chalk, or grinds in the mill[307]With a whip deedle, deedle, deedle, deedle;Ah little monkey.[307] Breaking chalk, grinding in mills, raising sand and graveland making of lime were among the employments assigned tovagrants and others committed to Bridewell.--_Reed.__Hip._ What rogue durst serve that warrant, knowing I loved her?_Lod._ Some worshipful rascal, I lay my life._Hip._ I’ll beat the lodgings down about their earsThat are her keepers._Lod._ So you may bring an old house over her head._Hip_. I’ll to her--I’ll to her, stood armed fiends to guard the doors.      [_Exit.__Lod._ Oh me! what monsters are men made by whores!If this false fire do kindle him, there’s one faggotMore to the bonfire. Now to my Bridewell birds;What song will they sing?      [_Exit._SCENE II.--_An Apartment in Bridewell.__Enter_ DUKE, INFELICE, CAROLO, ASTOLFO, BERALDO, FONTINELL, _andseveral ~Masters of Bridewell~_._Duke._ Your Bridewell? that the name? for beauty, strength,Capacity and form of ancient building,Besides the river’s neighbourhood, few housesWherein we keep our court can better it._1st Mast._ Hither from foreign courts have princes come,And with our duke did acts of State commence,Here that great cardinal had first audience,The grave Campayne; that duke dead, his sonThat famous prince gave free possessionOf this, his palace, to the citizens,To be the poor man’s ware-house; and endowed itWith lands to the value of seven hundred marks,[308]With all the bedding and the furniture, once proper,As the lands then were, to an hospitalBelonging to a Duke of Savoy. ThusFortune can toss the world; a prince’s courtIs thus a prison now.[308] This and the subsequent allusions to the Bridewell ofMilan, of course, really have reference to the London Bridewell.In the reign of Henry VIII. princes were lodged there, and itwas there that Cardinal Campeius had his first audience of theking. After Henry’s death, Edward VI. gave the palace to thecitizens. It was moreover endowed with land belonging to theSavoy to the amount of 700 marks a year and the bedding andfurniture of this hospital were bestowed upon it._Duke._ ’Tis Fortune’s sport:These changes common are: the wheel of fateTurns kingdoms up, till they fall desolate.But how are these seven hundred marks by th’ yearEmployed in this your work-house?_1st Mast._ War and peaceFeed both upon those lands: when the iron doorsOf war burst open, from this house are sentMen furnished in all martial complement.The moon hath thorough her bow scarce drawn to th’ head,Like to twelve silver arrows, all the months,Since sixteen hundred soldiers went abroad.Here providence and charity play such parts,The house is like a very school of arts,For when our soldiers, like ships driven from sea,With ribs all broken, and with tattered sides,Cast anchor here again, their ragged backsHow often do we cover! that, like men,They may be sent to their own homes again.All here are but one swarm of bees, and striveTo bring with wearied thighs honey to the hive.The sturdy beggar, and the lazy loon,Gets here hard hands, or laced correction.The vagabond grows staid, and learns t’obey,The drone is beaten well, and sent away.As other prisons are, some for the thief,Some, by which undone credit gets reliefFrom bridled debtors; others for the poor,So this is for the bawd, the rogue, the whore._Car._ An excellent team of horse!_1st Mast._ Nor is it seenThat the whip draws blood here, to cool the spleenOf any rugged bencher; nor does offenceFeel smart on spiteful, or rash evidence:But pregnant testimony forth must stand,Ere justice leave them in the beadle’s hand,As iron, on the anvil are they laid,Not to take blows alone, but to be madeAnd fashioned to some charitable use._Duke._ Thus wholsom’st laws spring from the worst abuse._Enter_ ORLANDO, _disguised as a ~Serving-man~, and_BELLAFRONT._Bell._ Let mercy touch your heart-strings, gracious lord,That it may sound like music in the earOf a man desperate, being i’th’ hands of law._Duke._ His name?_Bell._ Matheo._Duke._ For a robbery? where is he?_Bell._ In this house. [_Exeunt_ BELLAFRONT _and ~2ndMaster~_._Duke._ Fetch you him hither--Isthis the party?_Orl._ This is the hen, my lord, that the cock with the lordlycomb, your son-in-law, would crow over, and tread._Duke._ Are your two servants ready?_Orl._ My two pedlars are packed together, my good lord._Duke._ ’Tis well: this day in judgment shall be spent:Vice, like a wound lanced, mends by punishment._Inf._ Let me be gone, my lord, or stand unseen;’Tis rare when a judge strikes, and that none die,And ’tis unfit then women should be by._1st Mast._ We’ll place you, lady, in some private room._Inf._ Pray do so. [_Exit with ~1st Master~, who returns alone.__Orl._ Thus nice dames swear, it is unfit their eyesShould view men carved up for anatomies,[309]Yet they’ll see all, so they may stand unseen;Many women sure will sin behind a screen.[309] _i.e._ Skeletons._Enter_ LODOVICO._Lod._ Your son, the Lord Hippolito, is entered._Duke._ Tell him we wish his presence. A word, Sforza;On what wings flew he hither?_Lod._ These--I told him his lark whom he loved, was aBridewell-bird; he’s mad that this cage should hold her, and iscome to let her out._Duke._ ’Tis excellent: away, go call him hither. [_Exit_LODOVICO._Re-enter on one side ~2nd Master~ and_ BELLAFRONT_with_ MATHEO, _and ~Constable~_; _on the other_,LODOVICO _with_ HIPPOLITO. ORLANDO_goes out, and returns with two of his ~Servants~ disguised as~Pedlars~_._Duke._ You are to us a stranger, worthy lord,’Tis strange to see you here._Hip._ It is most fit,That where the sun goes, atomies[310] follow it.[310] Atoms._Duke._ Atomies neither shape, nor honour bear:Be you yourself, a sunbeam to shine clear.--Is this the gentleman? Stand forth and hearYour accusation._Mat._ I’ll hear none: I fly high in that: rather than kitesshall seize upon me, and pick out mine eyes to my face, I’llstrike my talons through mine own heart first, and spit my bloodin theirs. I am here for shriving those two fools of theirsinful pack: when those jackdaws have cawed over me, then must Icry guilty, or not guilty; the law has work enough already andtherefore I’ll put no work of mine into his hands; the hangmanshall ha’t first; I did pluck those ganders, did rob them._Duke._ ’Tis well done to confess._Mat._ Confess and be hanged, and then I fly high, is’t not so?That for that; a gallows is the worst rub that a good bowlercan meet with; I stumbled against such a post, else this nightI had played the part of a true son in these days, undone myfather-in-law; with him would I ha’ run at leap-frog, and comeover his gold, though I had broke his neck for’t: but the poorsalmon-trout is now in the net._Hip._ And now the law must teach you to fly high._Mat._ Right, my lord, and then may you fly low; no morewords:--a mouse, mum, you are stopped._Bell._ Be good to my poor husband, dear my lords._Mat._ Ass!Why shouldst thou pray them to be good to me,When no man here is good to one another?_Duke._ Did any hand work in this theft but yours?_Mat._ O, yes, my lord, yes:--the hangman has never one son at abirth, his children always come by couples: though I cannot givethe old dog, my father, a bone to gnaw, the daughter shall besure of a choke-pear.[311] Yes, my lord, there was one more thatfiddled my fine pedlars, and that was my wife.[311] Slang term for a small copper coin._Bell._ Alas, I?_Orl._ O everlasting, supernatural superlative villain! [_Aside.__Duke_, _Lod._, _&c._ Your wife, Matheo?_Hip._ Sure it cannot be._Mat._ Oh, sir, you love no quarters of mutton that hang up, youlove none but whole mutton. She set the robbery, I performed it;she spurred me on, I galloped away._Orl._ My lords,--_Bell._ My lords,--fellow, give me speech,--if my poor lifeMay ransom thine, I yield it to the law,Thou hurt’st thy soul, yet wip’st off no offence,By casting blots upon my innocence:Let not these spare me, but tell truth: no, seeWho slips his neck out of the misery,Though not out of the mischief: let thy servantThat shared in this base act, accuse me here,Why should my husband perish, he go clear?_Orl._ A good child, hang thine own father! [_Aside.__Duke._ Old fellow, was thy hand in too?_Orl._ My hand was in the pie, my lord, I confess it: mymistress, I see, will bring me to the gallows, and so leaveme; but I’ll not leave her so: I had rather hang in a woman’scompany, than in a man’s; because if we should go to helltogether, I should scarce be letten in, for all the devils areafraid to have any women come amongst them. As I am true thief,she neither consented to this felony, nor knew of it._Duke._ What fury prompts thee on to kill thy wife?_Mat._ It is my humour, sir, ’tis a foolish bag-pipe that I makemyself merry with: why should I eat hemp-seed at the hangman’sthirteen-pence halfpenny[312] ordinary, and have this whorelaugh at me, as I swing, as I totter?[312] The amount of the hangman’s fee._Duke._ Is she a whore?_Mat._ A six-penny mutton pasty, for any to cut up._Orl._ Ah, toad, toad, toad._Mat._ A barber’s cittern[313] for every serving-man to playupon; that lord, your son, knows it.[313] A cittern or lute was part of the appointments of abarber’s shop of the period._Hip._ I, sir? Am I her bawd then?_Mat._ No, sir, but she’s your whore then._Orl._ Yea, spider; dost catch at great flies? [_Aside.__Hip._ My whore?_Mat._ I cannot talk, sir, and tell of your rems and your reesand your whirligigs and devices: but, my lord, I found ’em likesparrows in one nest, billing together, and bulling of me. Itook ’em in bed, was ready to kill him, was up to stab her--_Hip._ Close thy rank jaws:--pardon me, I am vexed;Thou art a villain, a malicious devil,Deep as the place where thou art lost, thou liest,Since I am thus far got into this storm,I’ll through, and thou shall see I’ll through untouched,When thou shalt perish in it._Re-enter_ INFELICE._Inf._ ’Tis my cue,To enter now.--Room! let my prize[314] be played;I ha’ lurked in clouds, yet heard what all have said;What jury more can prove sh’as wronged my bed,Than her own husband; she must be punishèd.I challenge law, my lord; letters and gold,And jewels from my lord that woman took.[314] A term in fencing. See note _ante_, p. 160._Hip._ Against that black-mouthed devil, against letters and gold,And against a jealous wife, I do upholdThus far her reputation; I could soonerShake th’ Appenine, and crumble rocks to dust,Than, though Jove’s shower rained down, tempt her to lust._Bel._ What shall I say?_Orl._ [_Throwing off his disguise._] Say thou art not a whore,and that’s more than fifteen women amongst five hundred dareswear without lying: this shalt thou say--no, let me say’t forthee--thy husband’s a knave, this lord’s an honest man; thou artno punk, this lady’s a right lady. Pacheco is a thief as hismaster is, but old Orlando is as true a man as thy father is.I ha’ seen you fly high, sir, and I ha’ seen you fly low, sir,and to keep you from the gallows, sir, a blue coat have I worn,and a thief did I turn. Mine own men are the pedlars, my twentypounds did fly high, sir, your wife’s gown did fly low, sir:whither fly you now, sir? you ha’ scaped the gallows, to thedevil you fly next, sir. Am I right, my liege?_Duke._ Your father has the true physician played._Mat._ And I am now his patient._Hip._ And be so still;’Tis a good sign when our cheeks blush at ill._Const._ The linen-draper, Signor Candido,He whom the city terms the patient man,Is likewise here for buying of those lawnsThe pedlars lost._Inf._ Alas, good Candido!_Duke._ Fetch him [_Exit ~Constable~_] and when these payments      up are cast,Weigh out your light gold, but let’s have them last._Enter_ CANDIDO _and ~Constable~, who presently goesout_._Duke._ In Bridewell, Candido?_Cand._ Yes, my good lord._Duke._ What make you here?_Cand._ My lord, what make you here?_Duke._ I’m here to save right, and to drive wrong hence._Cand._ And I to bear wrong here with patience._Duke._ You ha’ bought stol’n goods._Cand._ So they do say, my lord,Yet bought I them upon a gentleman’s word,And I imagine now, as I thought then,That there be thieves, but no thieves, gentlemen._Hip._ Your credit’s cracked, being here._Cand._ No more than goldBeing cracked, which does his estimation hold.I was in Bedlam once, but was I mad?They made me pledge whores’ healths, but am I badBecause I’m with bad people?_Duke._ Well, stand by;If you take wrong, we’ll cure the injury._Re-enter ~Constable~, after him_ BOTS, _then two~Beadles~, one with hemp, the other with a beetle_.[315][315] A heavy mallet._Duke._ Stay, stay, what’s he? a prisoner?_Const._ Yes, my lord._Hip._ He seems a soldier?_Bots._ I am what I seem, sir, one of fortune’s bastards, asoldier and a gentleman, and am brought in here with masterconstable’s band of billmen, because they face me down that Ilive, like those that keep bowling alleys, by the sins of thepeople, in being a squire of the body._Hip._ Oh, an apple-squire.[316][316] The term was applied both to a kept gallant and to apander._Bots._ Yes, sir, that degree of scurvy squires; and that I ammaintained by the best part that is commonly in a woman, by theworst players of those parts; but I am known to all this company._Lod._ My lord, ’tis true, we all know him, ’tis Lieutenant Bots._Duke._ Bots, and where ha’ you served, Bots?_Bots._ In most of your hottest services in the Low-countries:at the Groyne I was wounded in this thigh, and halted upon’t,but ’tis now sound. In Cleveland I missed but little, havingthe bridge of my nose broken down with two great stones, as Iwas scaling a fort. I ha’ been tried, sir, too, in Gelderland,and ’scaped hardly there from being blown up at a breach: I wasfired, and lay i’ th’ surgeon’s hands for’t, till the fall ofthe leaf following._Hip._ All this may be, and yet you no soldier._Bots._ No soldier, sir? I hope these are services that yourproudest commanders do venture upon, and never come offsometimes._Duke._ Well, sir, because you say you are a soldier,I’ll use you like a gentleman.--Make room there,Plant him amongst you; we shall have anonStrange hawks fly here before us: if none lightOn you, you shall with freedom take your flight:But if you prove a bird of baser wing,We’ll use you like such birds, here you shall sing._Bots._ I wish to be tried at no other weapon._Duke._ Why, is he furnished with those implements?_1st Master._ The pander is more dangerous to a State,Than is the common thief; and though our lawsLie heavier on the thief, yet that the panderMay know the hangman’s ruff should fit him too,Therefore he’s set to beat hemp._Duke._ This does savourOf justice; basest slaves to basest labour.Now pray, set open hell, and let us seeThe she-devils that are here._Inf._ Methinks this placeShould make e’en Lais honest._1st Mast._ Some it turns good,But as some men, whose hands are once in blood,Do in a pride spill more, so, some going hence,Are, by being here, lost in more impudence.Let it not to them, when they come, appearThat any one does as their judge sit here:But that as gentlemen you come to see,And then perhaps their tongues will walk more free._Duke._ Let them be marshalled in.--[_Exeunt ~1st~ and ~2ndMasters~, ~Constable~, and ~Beadles~._]--Be covered all,Fellows, now to make the scene more comical._Car._ Will not you be smelt out, Bots?_Bots._ No, your bravest whores have the worse noses._Re-enter ~1st~ and ~2nd Masters~ and ~Constable~, then_DOROTHEA TARGET, _brave_[317]; _after her two~Beadles~, the one with a wheel, the other with a blue gown_.[317] Smartly attired._Lod._ Are not you a bride, forsooth?_Dor._ Say ye?_Car._ He would know if these be not your bridemen._Dor._ Vuh! yes, sir: and look ye, do you see? the bride-lacesthat I give at my wedding, will serve to tie rosemary to bothyour coffins when you come from hanging--Scab!_Orl._ Fie, punk, fie, fie, fie!_Dor._ Out, you stale, stinking head of garlic, foh, at my heels._Orl._ My head’s cloven._Hip._ O, let the gentlewoman alone, she’s going to shrift._Ast._ Nay, to do penance._Car._ Ay, ay, go, punk, go to the cross and be whipt._Dor._ Marry mew, marry muff,[318] marry, hang you, goodmandog: whipt? do ye take me for a base spittle-whore? In troth,gentlemen, you wear the clothes of gentlemen, but you carry notthe minds of gentlemen, to abuse a gentlewoman of my fashion.[318] A term of contempt._Lod._ Fashion? pox a’ your fashions! art not a whore?_Dor._ Goodman slave._Duke._ O fie, abuse her not, let us two talk,What might I call your name, pray?_Dor._ I’m not ashamed of my name, sir; my name is Mistress DollTarget, a Western gentlewoman._Lod._ Her target against any pike in Milan._Duke._ Why is this wheel borne after her?_1st Mast._ She must spin._Dor._ A coarse thread it shall be, as all threads are._Ast._ If you spin, then you’ll earn money here too?_Dor._ I had rather get half-a-crown abroad, than ten crownshere._Orl._ Abroad? I think so._Inf._ Dost thou not weep now thou art here?_Dor._ Say ye? weep? yes, forsooth, as you did when you lostyour maidenhead: do you not hear how I weep? [_Sings.__Lod._ Farewell, Doll._Dor._ Farewell, dog. [_Exit.__Duke._ Past shame: past penitence! Why is that blue gown?_1st Mast._ Being stript out of her wanton loose attire,That garment she puts on, base to the eye,Only to clothe her in humility._Duke._ Are all the rest like this?_1st Mast._ No, my good lord.You see, this drab swells with a wanton rein,The next that enters has a different strain._Duke._ Variety is good, let’s see the rest. [_Exeunt ~1st~ and~2nd Masters~ and ~Constable~.__Bots._ Your grace sees I’m sound yet, and no bullets hit me._Duke._ Come off so, and ’tis well._Lod._, _Ast._, _&c._ Here’s the second mess._Re-enter ~1st~ and ~2nd Masters~ and ~Constable~, then_PENELOPE WHOREHOUND, _dressed like a ~Citizen’s Wife~;her two ~Beadles~, one with a blue gown, another with chalk anda mallet_._Pen._ I ha’ worn many a costly gown, but I was never thusguarded[319] with blue coats, and beadles, and constables, and--[319] A play upon the word, which also signifies “trimmed.”_Car._ Alas, fair mistress, spoil not thus your eyes._Pen._ Oh, sweet sir, I fear the spoiling of other places aboutme that are dearer than my eyes; if you be gentlemen, if you bemen, or ever came of a woman, pity my case! stand to me, stickto me, good sir, you are an old man._Orl._ Hang not on me, I prithee, old trees bear no such fruit._Pen._ Will you bail me, gentlemen?_Lod._ Bail thee? art in for debt?_Pen._ No; God is my judge, sir, I am in for no debts; I paid mytailor for this gown, the last five shillings a-week that wasbehind, yesterday._Duke._ What is your name, I pray?_Pen._ Penelope Whorehound, I come of the Whorehounds. How doesLieutenant Bots?_Lod._, _Ast._, _&c._ Aha, Bots!_Bots._ A very honest woman, as I’m a soldier--a pox Bots ye._Pen._ I was never in this pickle before; and yet if I goamongst citizens’ wives, they jeer at me; if I go among theloose-bodied gowns,[320] they cry a pox on me, because I gocivilly attired, and swear their trade was a good trade, tillsuch as I am took it out of their hands. Good Lieutenant Bots,speak to these captains to bail me.[320] Prostitutes._1st Mast._ Begging for bail still? you are a trim gossip;Go give her the blue gown, set her to her chare.[321]Work huswife, for your bread, away.[321] Task work._Pen._ Out, you dog!--a pox on you all!--women are born to cursethee--but I shall live to see twenty such flat-caps shaking dicefor a penny-worth of pippins--out, you blue-eyed rogue. [_Exit.__Lod._, _Ast._, _&c._ Ha, ha, ha._Duke._ Even now she wept, and prayed; now does she curse?_1st Mast._ Seeing me; if still sh’ had stayed, this had beenworse._Hip._ Was she ever here before?_1st Mast._ Five times at least,And thus if men come to her, have her eyesWrung, and wept out her bail._Lod._, _Ast._, _&c._ Bots, you know her?_Bots._ Is there any gentleman here, that knows not a whore, andis he a hair the worse for that?_Duke._ Is she a city-dame, she’s so attired?_1st Mast._ No, my good lord, that’s only but the veilTo her loose body, I have seen her hereIn gayer masking suits, as several saucesGive one dish several tastes, so change of habitsIn whores is a bewitching art: to dayShe’s all in colours to besot gallants, thenIn modest black, to catch the citizen,And this from their examination’s drawn.Now shall you see a monster both in shapeAnd nature quite from these, that sheds no tear,Nor yet is nice, ’tis a plain ramping bear;Many such whales are cast upon this shore._Duke_, _Lod._, _&c._ Let’s see her._1st Mast._ Then behold a swaggering whore. [_Exeunt ~1st~ and~2nd Masters~ and ~Constable~.__Orl._ Keep your ground, Bots._Bots._ I do but traverse to spy advantage how to arm myself._Re-enter ~1st~ and ~2nd Masters~ and ~Constable~; afterthem a ~Beadle~ beating a basin,[322] then_ CATHERINABOUNTINALL, _with ~Mistress~_ HORSELEECH; _afterthem another ~Beadle~ with a blue head guarded[323] with yellow_.[322] At the carting of bawds and prostitutes they were precededby a mob beating basins and performing other rough music.[323] Trimmed._Cat._ Sirrah, when I cry hold your hands, hold, yourogue-catcher, hold:--Bawd, are the French chilblains in yourheels, that you can come no faster? Are not you, bawd, a whore’sancient,[324] and must not I follow my colours?[324] Ensign._Mis. H._ O Mistress Catherine, you do me wrong to accuse mehere as you do, before the right worshipful. I am known for amotherly, honest woman, and no bawd._Cat._ Marry foh, honest? burnt[325] at fourteen, seven timeswhipt, five times carted, nine times ducked, searched by somehundred and fifty constables, and yet you are honest? HonestMistress Horseleech, is this world a world to keep bawds andwhores honest? How many times hast thou given gentlemen a quartof wine in a gallon pot? how many twelve-penny fees, nay twoshillings fees, nay, when any ambassadors ha’ been here, howmany half-crown fees hast thou taken? How many carriers hastthou bribed for country wenches? how often have I rinsed yourlungs in _aqua vitæ_, and yet you are honest?[325] Branded._Duke._ And what were you the whilst?_Cat._ Marry hang you, master slave, who made you an examiner?_Lod._ Well said! belike this devil spares no man._Cat._ What art thou, prithee? [_To_ BOTS._Bots._ Nay, what art thou, prithee?_Cat._ A whore, art thou a thief?_Bots._ A thief, no, I defy[326] the calling; I am a soldier,have borne arms in the field, been in many a hot skirmish, yetcome off sound.[326] Disdain._Cat._ Sound, with a pox to ye, ye abominable rogue! you asoldier? you in skirmishes? where? amongst pottle pots in abawdy-house? Look, look here, you Madam Wormeaten, do you notknow him?_Mis. H._ Lieutenant Bots, where have ye been this many a day?_Bots._ Old bawd, do not discredit me, seem not to know me._Mis. H._ Not to know ye, Master Bots? as long as I have breath,I cannot forget thy sweet face._Duke._ Why, do you know him? he says he is a soldier._Cat._ He a soldier? a pander, a dog that will lick up sixpence:do ye hear, you master swines’-snout, how long is’t since youheld the door for me, and cried to’t again, No body comes! yerogue, you?_Lod._, _Ast._, _&c._ Ha, ha, ha! you’re smelt out again, Bots._Bots._ Pox ruin her nose for’t! an I be not revenged forthis--um, ye bitch!_Lod._ D’ye hear ye, madam? why does your ladyship swagger thus?you’re very brave,[327] methinks.[327] Finely dressed._Cat._ Not at your cost, master cod’s-head;Is any man here blear-eyed to see me brave?_Ast._ Yes, I am,Because good clothes upon a whore’s backIs like fair painting upon a rotten wall._Cat._ Marry muff master whoremaster, you come upon me withsentences._Ber._ By this light, has small sense for’t._Lod._ O fie, fie, do not vex her! And yet methinks a creatureof more scurvy conditions should not know what a good petticoatwere._Cat._ Marry come out, you’re so busy about my petticoat, you’llcreep up to my placket, an ye could but attain the honour: butan the outsides offend your rogueships, look o’the lining, ’tissilk._Duke._ Is’t silk ’tis lined with, then?_Cat._ Silk? Ay, silk, master slave, you would be glad to wipeyour nose with the skirt on’t. This ’tis to come among a companyof cod’s-heads[328] that know not how to use a gentlewoman.[328] Fools._Duke._ Tell her the duke is here._1st Mast._ Be modest, Kate, the duke is here._Cat._ If the devil were here, I care not: set forward, yerogues, and give attendance according to your places! Let bawdsand whores be sad, for I’ll sing an the devil were a-dying.[_Exit with ~Mistress~_ HORSELEECH _and ~Beadles~_._Duke._ Why before her does the basin ring?_1st Mast._ It is an emblem of their revelling,The whips we use let forth their wanton blood,Making them calm; and more to calm their pride,Instead of coaches they in carts do ride.Will your grace see more of this bad ware?_Duke._ No, shut up shop, we’ll now break up the fair,Yet ere we part--you, sir, that take upon yeThe name of soldier, that true name of worth,Which, action, not vain boasting, best sets forth,To let you know how far a soldier’s nameStands from your title, and to let you see,Soldiers must not be wronged where princes be:This be your sentence._All._ Defend yourself, Bots._Duke._ First, all the private sufferance that the houseInflicts upon offenders, you, as the basest,Shall undergo it double, after whichYou shall be whipt, sir, round about the city,Then banished from the land._Bots._ Beseech, your grace!_Duke._ Away with him, see it done, panders and whoresAre city-plagues which being kept alive,Nothing that looks like goodness ere can thrive.Now good Orlando, what say you to your bad son-in-law?_Orl._ Marry this, my lord, he is my son-in-law, and in lawwill I be his father: for if law can pepper him, he shall beso parboiled, that he shall stink no more i’ th’ nose of thecommon-wealth._Bell._ Be yet more kind and merciful, good father._Orl._ Dost thou beg for him, thou precious man’s meat, thou?has he not beaten thee, kicked thee, trod on thee, and dost thoufawn on him like his spaniel? has he not pawned thee to thypetticoat, sold thee to thy smock, made ye leap at a crust, yetwouldst have me save him?_Bell._ Oh yes, good sir, women shall learn of me,To love their husbands in greatest misery;Then show him pity, or you wreck myself._Orl._ Have ye eaten pigeons, that you’re so kind-hearted toyour mate? Nay, you’re a couple of wild bears, I’ll have yeboth baited at one stake: but as for this knave, the gallowsis thy due, and the gallows thou shall have, I’ll have justiceof the duke, the law shall have thy life--What, dost thou holdhim? let go, his hand. If thou dost not forsake him, a father’severlasting blessing fall upon both your heads! Away, go, kissout of my sight, play thou the whore no more, nor thou the thiefagain; my house shall be thine, my meat shall be thine, and soshall my wine, but my money shall be mine, and yet when I die,so thou dost not fly high, take all;Yet, good Matheo, mend.Thus for joy weeps Orlando, and doth end._Duke._ Then hear, Matheo: all your woes are stayedBy your good father-in-law: all your illsAre clear purged from you by his working pills.--Come, Signor Candido, these green young wits,We see by circumstance, this plot have laid,Still to provoke thy patience, which they findA wall of brass; no armour’s like the mind.Thou hast taught the city patience, now our courtShall be thy sphere, where from thy good report,Rumours this truth unto the world shall sing,A patient man’s a pattern for a king.

Melpomene herself    With all her sisters sound their instruments,    Only excepted fair Calliope,    Who, coming last and hanging down her head,    Doth plainly show by outward actions    What secret sorrow doth torment her heart.    [_Stands aside._    _Mel._ Calliope, thou which so oft didst crake[30]    How that such clients cluster'd to thy court,    By thick and threefold, as not any one    Of all thy sisters might compare with thee,    Where be thy scholars now become, I trow?    Where are they vanish'd in such sudden sort,    That, while as we do play upon our strings,    You stand still lazing, and have naught to do?    _Clio._ Melpomene, make you a why of that?    I know full oft you have [in] authors read,    The higher tree, the sooner is his fall,    And they which first do flourish and bear sway,    Upon the sudden vanish clean away.    _Cal._ Mock on apace; my back is broad enough    To bear your flouts as many as they be.    That year is rare that ne'er feels winter's storms;    That tree is fertile which ne'er wanteth fruit;    And that same Muse hath heap重 well in store    Which never wanteth clients at her door.    But yet, my sisters, when the surgent seas    Have ebb'd their fill, their waves do rise again,    And fill their banks up to the very brims;    And when my pipe hath eas'd herself a while,    Such store of suitors shall my seat frequent,    That you shall see my scholars be not spent.    _Erato._ Spent, quoth you, sister? then we were to blame,    If we should say your scholars all were spent:    But pray now tell me when your painful pen    Will rest enough?    _Mel._ When husbandmen shear hogs.    _Ven._ [_coming forward_]. Melpomene, Erato,[31] and the rest,    From thickest shrubs Dame Venus did espy    The mortal hatred which you jointly bear    Unto your sister high Calliope.    What, do you think if that the tree do bend,    It follows therefore that it needs must break?    And since her pipe a little while doth rest,    It never shall be able for to sound?    Yes, Muses, yes, if that she will vouchsafe    To entertain Dame Venus in her school,    And further me with her instructions,    She shall have scholars which will dain to be    In any other Muse's company.    _Cal._ Most sacred Venus, do you doubt of that?    Calliope would think her three times blest    For to receive a goddess in her school,    Especially so high an one as you,    Which rules the earth, and guides the heavens too.    _Ven._ Then sound your pipes, and let us bend our steps    Unto the top of high Parnassus Hill,    And there together do our best devoir    For to describe Alphonsus' warlike fame,    And, in the manner of a comedy,    Set down his noble valour presently.    _Cal._ As Venus wills, so bids Calliope.    _Mel._ And as you bid, your sisters do agree. [_Exeunt._SCENE I.--_Near Naples._     _Enter_ CARINUS _and_ ALPHONSUS.    _Cari._ My noble son, since first I did recount    The noble acts your predecessors did    In Arragon against their warlike foes,    I never yet could see thee joy at all,    But hanging down thy head as malcontent,    Thy youthful days in mourning have been spent.    Tell me, Alphonsus, what might be the cause    That makes thee thus to pine away with care?    Hath old Carinus done thee any offence    In reckoning up these stories unto thee?    What ne'er a word but mum? Alphonsus, speak,    Unless your father's fatal day you seek.    _Alphon._ Although, dear father, I have often vow'd    Ne'er to unfold the secrets of my heart    To any man or woman, whosome'er    Dwells underneath the circle of the sky;    Yet do your words so c溶jure me, dear sire,    That needs I must fulfil that you require.    Then so it is. Amongst the famous tales    Which you rehears'd done by our sires in war,    Whenas you came unto your father's days,    With sobbing notes, with sighs and blubbering tears,    And much ado, at length you thus began:    "Next to Alphonsus should my father come    For to possess the diadem by right    Of Arragon, but that the wicked wretch    His younger brother, with aspiring mind,    By secret treason robb'd him of his life,    And me his son of that which was my due."    These words, my sire, did so torment my mind,    As had I been with Ixion[32] in hell,    The ravening bird could never plague me worse;    For ever since my mind hath troubled been    Which way I might revenge this traitorous fact,    And that recover which is ours by right.    _Cari._ Ah, my Alphonsus, never think on that!    In vain it is to strive against the stream:    The crown is lost, and now in hucksters' hands,    And all our hope is cast into the dust.    Bridle these thoughts, and learn the same of me,--    A quiet life doth pass an empery.    _Alphon._ Yet, noble father, ere Carinus' brood    Shall brook his foe for to usurp his seat,    He'll die the death with honour in the field,    And so his life and sorrows briefly end.    But did I know my froward fate were such    As I should fail in this my just attempt,    This sword, dear father, should the author be    To make an end of this my tragedy.    Therefore, sweet sire, remain you here a while,    And let me walk my Fortune for to try.    I do not doubt but, ere the time be long,    I'll quite his cost, or else myself will die.    _Cari._ My noble son, since that thy mind is such    For to revenge thy father's foul abuse,    As that my words may not a whit prevail    To stay thy journey, go with happy fate,    And soon return unto thy father's cell,    With such a train as Julius Cｾsar came    To noble Rome, whenas he had achiev'd[33]    The mighty monarch of the triple world.    Meantime Carinus in this silly[34] grove    Will spend his days with prayers and orisons,    To mighty Jove to further thine intent.    Farewell, dear son, Alphonsus, fare you well. [_Exit._    _Alphon._ And is he gone? then hie, Alphonsus, hie,    To try thy fortune where thy fates do call.    A noble mind disdains to hide his head,    And let his foes triumph in his overthrow.    [_Makes as though to go out._     _Enter_ ALBINIUS.    _Albi._ What loitering fellow have we spi重 here?    Presume not, villain, further for to go,    Unless[35] you do at length the same repent.    _Alphon._ [_coming towards_ ALBINIUS].    "Villain," say'st thou? nay, "villain" in thy throat!    What, know'st thou, skipjack, whom thou villain call'st?    _Albi._ A common vassal I do villain call.    _Alphon._ That shalt thou soon approve, persuade thyself,    Or else I'll die, or thou shalt die for me.    _Albi._ What, do I dream, or do my dazzling eyes    Deceive me? Is't Alphonsus that I see?    Doth now Medea use her wonted charms    For to delude Albinius' fantasy?    Or doth black Pluto, king of dark Avern,    Seek to flout me with his counterfeit?    His body like to Alphonsus' fram重 is;    His face resembles much Alphonsus' hue;    His noble mind declares him for no less;    'Tis he indeed. Woe worth Albinius,    Whose babbling tongue hath caus'd his own annoy!    Why doth not Jove send from the glittering skies    His thunderbolts to ch㎏tise this offence?    Why doth Dame Terra cease[36] with greedy jaws    To swallow up Albinius presently?    What, shall I fly and hide my traitorous head,    From stout Alphonsus whom I so misus'd?    Or shall I yield? Tush, yielding is in vain:    Nor can I fly, but he will follow me.    Then cast thyself down at his grace's feet,    Confess thy fault, and ready make thy breast    To entertain thy well-deserv重 death. [_Kneels._    _Alphon._ What news, my friend? why are you so blank,    That erst before did vaunt it to the skies?    _Albi._ Pardon, dear lord! Albinius pardon craves    For this offence, which, by the heavens I vow,    Unwittingly I did unto your grace;    For had I known Alphonsus had been here,    Ere that my tongue had spoke so traitorously,    This hand should make my very soul to die.    _Alphon._ Rise up, my friend, thy pardon soon is got:    [ALBINIUS _rises up._    But, prithee, tell me what the cause might be,    That in such sort thou erst upbraided'st me?    _Albi._ Most mighty prince, since first your father's sire    Did yield his ghost unto the Sisters Three,    And old Carinus forc重 was to fly    His native soil and royal diadem,    I, for because I seem重 to complain    Against their treason, shortly was forewarn'd    Ne'er more to haunt the bounds of Arragon,    On pain of death. Then like a man forlorn,    I sought about to find some resting-place,    And at the length did hap upon this shore,    Where showing forth my cruel banishment,    By King Belinus I am succour重.    But now, my lord, to answer your demand:    It happens so, that the usurping king    Of Arragon makes war upon this land    For certain tribute which he claimeth here;    Wherefore Belinus sent me round about    His country for to gather up [his] men    For to withstand this most injurious foe;    Which being done, returning with the king,    Despitefully I did so taunt your grace,    Imagining you had some soldier been,    The which, for fear, had sneak重 from the camp.    _Alphon._ Enough, Albinius, I do know thy mind:    But may it be that these thy happy news    Should be of truth, or have you forg重 them?    _Albi._ The gods forbid that e'er Albinius' tongue    Should once be found to forge a feign重 tale,    Especially unto his sovereign lord:    But if Alphonsus think that I do feign,    Stay here a while, and you shall plainly see    My words be true, whenas you do perceive    Our royal army march before your face;    The which, if't please my noble lord to stay,    I'll hasten on with all the speed I may.    _Alphon._ Make haste, Albinius, if you love my life;    But yet beware, whenas your army comes,    You do not make as though you do me know,    For I a while a soldier base will be,    Until I find time more convenient    To show, Albinius, what is mine intent.    _Albi._ Whate'er Alphonsus fittest doth esteem,    Albinius for his profit best will deem. [_Exit._    _Alphon._ Now do I see both gods and fortune too    Do join their powers to raise Alphonsus' fame;    For in this broil I do not greatly doubt    But that I shall my cousin's courage tame.    But see whereas Belinus' army comes,    And he himself, unless I guess awry:    Whoe'er it be, I do not pass[37] a pin;    Alphonsus means his soldier for to be.    [_He stands aside._[38]SCENE II.--_The Camp of_ BELINUS. _Enter_ BELINUS, ALBINIUS, FABIUS, _marching with their_ Soldiers; _they make a stand._ ALPHONSUS _discovered at one side._    _Beli._ Thus far, my lords, we train重 have our camp    For to encounter haughty Arragon,    Who with a mighty power of straggling mates    Hath traitorously assail重 this our land,    And burning towns, and sacking cities fair,    Doth play the devil wheresome'er he comes.    Now, as we are inform重 of our scouts,    He marcheth on unto our chiefest seat,    Naples, I mean, that city of renown,    For to begirt it with his bands about,    And so at length, the which high Jove forbid,    To sack the same, as erst he other did.    If which should hap, Belinus were undone,    His country spoil'd, and all his subjects slain:    Wherefore your sovereign thinketh it most meet    For to prevent the fury of the foe,    And Naples succour, that distress重 town,    By entering in, ere Arragon doth come,    With all our men, which will sufficient be    For to withstand their cruel battery.    _Albi._ The silly serpent, found by country swain,    And cut in pieces by his furious blows,    Yet if her head do 'scape away untouch'd,    As many write, it very strangely goes    To fetch an herb, with which in little time    Her batter'd corpse again she doth conjoin:    But if by chance the ploughman's sturdy staff    Do hap to hit upon the serpent's head,    And bruise the same, though all the rest be sound    Yet doth the silly serpent lie for dead,    Nor can the rest of all her body serve    To find a salve which may her life preserve.    Even so, my lord, if Naples once be lost,    Which is the head of all your grace's land,    Easy it were for the malicious foe    To get the other cities in their hand:    But if from them that Naples town be free,    I do not doubt but safe the rest shall be;    And therefore, mighty king, I think it best,    To succour Naples rather than the rest.    _Beli._ 'Tis bravely spoken; by my crown I swear,    I like thy counsel, and will follow it.    But hark, Albinius, dost thou know the man,    That doth so closely overthwart us stand?    [_Pointing towards_ ALPHONSUS.    _Albi._ Not I, my lord, nor never saw him yet.    _Beli._ Then, prithee, go and ask him presently,    What countryman he is, and why he comes    Into this place? perhaps he is some one,    That is sent hither as a secret spy    To hear and see in secret what we do.    [ALBINIUS _and_ FABIUS _go toward_ ALPHONSUS.    _Albi._ My friend, what art thou, that so like a spy    Dost sneak about Belinus' royal camp?    _Alphon._ I am a man.    _Fabi._ A man! we know the same:    But prithee, tell me, and set scoffing by,    What countryman thou art, and why you come,    That we may soon resolve the king thereof?    _Alphon._ Why, say I am a soldier.    _Fabi._ Of whose band?    _Alphon._ Of his that will most wages to me give.    _Fabi._ But will you be    Content to serve Belinus in his wars?    _Alphon._ Ay, if he'll reward me as I do deserve,    And grant whate'er I win, it shall be mine    Incontinent.    _Albi._ Believe me, sir, your service costly is:    But stay a while, and I will bring you word    What King Belinus says unto the same.    [_Goes towards_ BELINUS.    _Beli._ What news, Albinius? who is that we see?    _Albi._ It is, my lord, a soldier that you see,    Who fain would serve your grace in these your wars,    But that, I fear, his service is too dear.    _Beli._ Too dear, why so? what doth the soldier crave?    _Albi._ He craves, my lord, all things that with his sword    He doth obtain, whatever that they be.    _Beli._ [_To_ ALPHONSUS]. Content, my friend; if thou wilt succour me,    Whate'er you get, that challenge as thine own;    Belinus gives it frankly unto thee,    Although it be the crown of Arragon.    Come on, theref羊e, and let us hie apace    To Naples town, whereas by this, I know,    Our foes have pitch'd their tents against our walls.    _Alphon._ March on, my lord, for I will follow you;    And do not doubt but, ere the time be long,    I shall obtain the crown of Arragon. [_Exeunt._ACT THE SECONDPROLOGUE _Enter_ BELINUS, ALBINIUS, FABIUS _and_ ALPHONSUS _with_ Soldiers; _alarum, and then enter_ VENUS.    _Venus._ Thus from the pit of pilgrim's poverty    Alphonsus 'gins by step and step to climb    Unto the top of friendly Fortune's wheel:    From banish'd state, as you have plainly seen,    He is transform'd into a soldier's life,    And marcheth in the ensign of the king    Of worthy Naples, which Belinus hight;    Not for because that he doth love him so,    But that he may revenge him on his foe.    Now on the top of lusty barb重 steed    He mounted is, in glittering armour clad,    Seeking about the troops of Arragon,    For to encounter with his traitorous niece.[39]    How he doth speed, and what doth him befall,    Mark this our act, for it doth show it all.    [_Exeunt._SCENE I.--_A Battle-field._ _Alarum. Enter_ FLAMINIUS _on one side,_ ALPHONSUS _on the other. They fight_; ALPHONSUS _kills_ FLAMINIUS.    _Alphon._ Go pack thou hence unto the Stygian lake,    And make report unto thy traitorous sire    How well thou hast enjoy'd the diadem    Which he by treason set upon thy head;    And if he ask thee who did send thee down,    Alphonsus say, who now must wear thy crown.     _Alarum. Enter_ LｮLIUS.    _Lｾli._ Traitor, how dar'st thou look me in the face,    Whose mighty king thou traitorously hast slain?    What, dost thou think Flaminius hath no friends    For to revenge his death on thee again?    Yes, be you sure that, ere you 'scape from hence,    Thy gasping ghost shall bear him company,    Or else myself, fighting for his defence,    Will be content by those thy hands to die.    _Alphon._ Lｾlius, few words would better thee become,    Especially as now the case doth stand;    And didst thou know whom thou dost threaten thus,    We should you have more calmer out of hand:    For, Lｾlius, know that I Alphonsus am,    The son and heir to old Carinus, whom    The traitorous father of Flaminius    Did secretly bereave his diadem.    But see the just revenge of mighty Jove!    The father dead, the son is likewise slain    By that man's hand who they did count as dead,    Yet doth survive to wear the diadem,    When they themselves accompany the ghosts    Which wander round about the Stygian fields.    [LｮLIUS _gazes upon_ ALPHONSUS.    Muse not hereat, for it is true I say;    I am Alphonsus, whom thou hast misus'd.    _Lｾli._ The man whose death I did so oft lament?    [_Kneels._    Then pardon me for these uncourteous words,    The which I in my rage did utter forth,    Prick'd by the duty of a loyal mind;    Pardon, Alphonsus, this my first offence,    And let me die if e'er I flight[40] again.    _Alphon._ Lｾlius, I fain would pardon this offence,    And eke accept thee to my grace again,    But that I fear that, when I stand in need    And want your help, you will your lord betray:    How say you, Lｾlius, may I trust to thee?    _Lｾli._ Ay, noble lord, by all the gods I vow;    For first shall heavens want stars, and foaming seas    Want watery drops, before I'll traitor be    Unto Alphonsus, whom I honour so.    _Alphon._ Well then, arise; and for because I'll try    [LｮLIUS _arises._    If that thy words and deeds be both alike,    Go haste and fetch the youths of Arragon,    Which now I hear have turn'd their heels and fled:    Tell them your chance, and bring them back again    Into this wood; where in ambushment lie,    Until I send or come for you myself.    _Lｾli._ I will, my lord.    [_Exit._    _Alphon._ Full little think Belinus and his peers    What thoughts Alphonsus casteth in his mind;    For if they did, they would not greatly haste    To pay the same the which they promis'd me. _Enter_ BELINUS, ALBINIUS, FABIUS, _with their_ Soldiers, _marching._    _Beli._ Like simple sheep, when shepherd absent is    Far from his flock, assail'd by greedy wolves,    Do scattering fly about, some here, some there,    To keep their bodies from their ravening jaws,    So do the fearful youths of Arragon    Run round about the green and pleasant plains,    And hide their heads from Neapolitans;    Such terror have their strong and sturdy blows    Struck to their hearts, as for a world of gold,    I warrant you, they will not come again.    But, noble lords, where is the knight become    Which made the blood be-sprinkle all the place    Whereas he did encounter with his foe?    My friend, Albinius, know you where he is?    _Albi._ Not I, my lord, for since in thickest ranks    I saw him chase Flaminius at the heels,    I never yet could set mine eyes on him.    But see, my lord, whereas the warrior stands,    Or else my sight doth fail me at this time.    [_Spies out_ ALPHONSUS, _and shows him to_ BELINUS.    _Beli._ 'Tis he indeed, who, as I do suppose,    Hath slain the king, or else some other lord,    For well I wot, a carcass I do see    Hard at his feet lie struggling on the ground.    Come on, Albinius, we will try the truth.    [BELINUS _and_ ALBINIUS _go towards_ ALPHONSUS.    Hail to the noble victor of our foes!    _Alphon._ Thanks, mighty prince; but yet I seek not this:    It is not words must recompense my pain,    But deeds. When first I took up arms for you,    Your promise was, whatever my sword did win    In fight, as his Alphonsus should it crave.    See, then, where lies thy foe Flaminius,    Whose crown my sword hath conquer'd in the field;    Therefore, Belinus, make no long delay,    But that discharge you promis'd for to pay.    _Beli._ Will nothing else satisfy thy conquering mind    Besides the crown? Well, since thou hast it won,    Thou shalt it have, though far against my will.    [ALPHONSUS _sits in the chair_; BELINUS _takes the crown off_    FLAMINIUS' _head, and puts it on that of_ ALPHONSUS.    Here doth Belinus crown thee with his hand    The King of Arragon.    [_Trumpets and drums sound within._                         What, are you pleas'd?    _Alphon._ Not so, Belinus, till you promise me    All things belonging to the royal crown    Of Arragon, and make your lordings swear    For to defend me to their utmost power    Against all men that shall gainsay the same.    _Beli._ Mark, what belong重 erst unto the crown    Of Arragon, that challenge as thine own;    Belinus gives it frankly unto thee,    And swears by all the powers of glittering skies    To do my best for to maintain the same,    So that it be not prejudicial    Unto mine honour, or my country-soil.    _Albi._ And by the sacred seat of mighty Jove    Albinius swears that first he'll die the death,    Before he'll see Alphonsus suffer wrong.    _Fabi._ What erst Albinius vow'd we jointly vow.    _Alphon._ Thanks, mighty lords; but yet I greatly fear    That very few will keep the oaths they swear.    But, what, Belinus, why stand you so long,    And cease from offering homage unto me?    What, know you not that I thy sovereign am,    Crown重 by thee and all thy other lords,    And now confirm重 by your solemn oaths?    Feed not thyself with fond persuasions,    But presently come yield thy crown to me,    And do me homage, or by heavens I swear    I'll force thee to it maugre all thy train.    _Beli._ How now, base brat! what, are thy wits thine own,    That thou dar'st thus abraid[41] me in my land?    'Tis best for thee these speeches to recall,    Or else, by Jove, I'll make thee to repent    That ere thou sett'st thy foot in Naples' soil.    _Alphon._ "Base brat," say'st thou? as good a man as thou:    But say I came but of a base descent,    My deeds shall make my glory for to shine    As clear as Luna in a winter's night.    But for because thou bragg'st so of thy birth,    I'll see how it shall profit thee anon.    _Fabi._ Alphonsus, cease from these thy threatening words,    And lay aside this thy presumptuous mind,    Or else be sure thou shalt the same repent.    _Alphon._ How now, sir boy! will you be prattling too?    'Tis best for thee to hold thy tattling tongue,    Unless I send some one to scourge thy breech.    Why, then, I see 'tis time to look about    When every boy Alphonsus dares control:    But be they sure, ere Phﾏbus' golden beams    Have compass重 the circle of the sky,    I'll clog their tongues, since nothing else will serve    To keep those vilde[42] and threatening speeches in.    Farewell, Belinus, look thou to thyself:    Alphonsus means to have thy crown ere night.    [_Exit._    _Beli._ What, is he gone? the devil break his neck,    The fiends of hell torment his traitorous corpse!    Is this the quittance of Belinus' grace,    Which he did show unto that thankless wretch,    That runagate, that rakehell, yea, that thief?    For, well I wot, he hath robb'd me of a crown.    If ever he had sprung from gentle blood,    He would not thus misuse his favourer.    _Albi._ "That runagate, that rakehell, yea, that thief"!    Stay there, sir king, your mouth runs over-much;    It ill becomes the subject for to use    Such traitorous terms against his sovereign.    Know thou, Belinus, that Carinus' son    Is neither rakehell, [no], nor runagate.    But be thou sure that, ere the darksome night    Do drive god Phﾏbus to his Thetis' lap,    Both thou, and all the rest of this thy train,    Shall well repent the words which you have sain.    _Beli._ What, traitorous villain, dost thou threaten me?--    Lay hold on him, and see he do not 'scape:    I'll teach the slave to know to whom he speaks.    _Albi._ To thee I speak, and to thy fellows all;    And though as now you have me in your power,    Yet doubt I not but that in little space    These eyes shall see thy treason recompens'd,    And then I mean to vaunt our victory.    _Beli._ Nay, proud Albinius, never build on that;    For though the gods do chance for to appoint    Alphonsus victor of Belinus' land,    Yet shalt thou never live to see that day;--    And therefore, Fabius, stand not lingering,    But presently slash off his traitorous head.    _Albi._ Slash off his head! as though Albinius' head    Were then so easy to be slash重 off:    In faith, sir, no; when you are gone and dead,    I hope to flourish like the pleasant spring.    _Beli._ Why, how now, Fabius! what, do you stand in doubt    To do the deed? what fear you? who dares seek    For to revenge his death on thee again,    Since that Belinus did command it so?    Or are you wax'd so dainty, that you dare    Not use your sword for staining of your hands?    If it be so, then let me see thy sword,    And I will be his butcher for this time.    [FABIUS _gives_ BELINUS _his sword drawn._    Now, Sir Albinius, are you of the mind    That erst you were? what, do you look to see,    And triumph in, Belinus' overthrow?    I hope the very sight of this my blade    Hath chang'd your mind into another tune.    _Albi._ Not so, Belinus, I am constant still;    My mind is like to the asbeston-stone,    Which, if it once be heat in flames of fire,    Denieth to becomen cold again:    Even so am I, and shall be till I die.    And though I should see Atropos appear,    With knife in hand, to slit my thread in twain,    Yet ne'er Albinius should persuaded be    But that Belinus he should vanquish'd see.    _Beli._ Nay, then, Albinius, since that words are vain    For to persuade you from this heresy,    This sword shall sure put you out of doubt.     [BELINUS _offers to strike off_ ALBINIUS' _head: alarum; enter_     ALPHONSUS _and his_ Men; BELINUS _and_ FABIUS _fly, followed by_     ALPHONSUS _and_ ALBINIUS.SCENE II.--_Another Part of the Field._     _Enter_ LｮLIUS, MILES, _and_ Servants.    _Lｾli._ My noble lords of Arragon, I know    You wonder much what might the occasion be    That Lｾlius, which erst did fly the field,    Doth egg you forwards now unto the wars;    But when you hear my reason, out of doubt    You'll be content with this my rash attempt.    When first our king, Flaminius I do mean,    Did set upon the Neapolitans,    The worst of you did know and plainly see    How far they were unable to withstand    The mighty forces of our royal camp,    Until such time as froward fates we thought,--    Although the fates ordain'd it for our gain,--    Did send a stranger stout, whose sturdy blows    And force alone did cause our overthrow.    But to our purpose: this same martial knight    Did hap to hit upon Flaminius,    And lent our king then such a friendly blow    As that his gasping ghost to Limbo went.    Which when I saw, and seeking to revenge,    My noble lords, did hap on such a prize    As never king nor keisar got the like.    _Miles._ Lｾlius, of force we must confess to thee,    We wonder'd all whenas you did persuade    Us to return unto the wars again;    But since our marvel is increas重 much    By these your words, which sound of happiness:    Therefore, good Lｾlius, make no tarrying,    But soon unfold thy happy chance to us.    _Lｾli._ Then, friends and fellow soldiers, hark to me;    When Lｾlius thought for to revenge his king    On that same knight, instead of mortal foe,    I found him for to be our chiefest friend.    _Miles._ Our chiefest friend! I hardly can believe    That he, which made such bloody massacres    Of stout Italians, can in any point    Bear friendship to the country or the king.    _Lｾli._ As for your king, Miles, I hold with you,    He bare no friendship to Flaminius,    But hated him as bloody Atropos;    But for your country, Lｾlius doth avow    He loves as well as any other land,    Yea, sure, he loves it best of all the world.    And, for because you shall not think that I    Do say the same without a reason why,    Know that the knight Alphonsus hath to name,    Both son and heir to old Carinus, whom    Flaminius' sire bereav重 of his crown;    Who did not seek the ruin of our host    For any envy he did bear to us,    But to revenge him on his mortal foe;    Which by the help of high celestial Jove    He hath achiev'd with honour in the field.    _Miles._ Alphonsus, man! I'll ne'er persuaded be    That e'er Alphonsus may survive again,    Who with Carinus, many years ago,    Was said to wander in the Stygian fields.    _Lｾli._ Truth, noble Miles: these mine ears have heard,    For certainty reported unto me,    That old Carinus, with his peerless son,    Had felt the sharpness of the Sisters' shears;    And had I not of late Alphonsus seen    In good estate, though all the world should say    He is alive, I would not credit them.    But, fellow soldiers, wend you back with me,    And let us lurk within the secret shade    Which he himself appointed unto us;    And if you find my words to be untroth,    Then let me die to recompense the wrong.     _Alarum: re-enter_ ALBINIUS _with his sword drawn._    _Albi._ Lｾlius, make haste: soldiers of Arragon,    Set lingering by, and come and help your king,    I mean Alphonsus, who, whilst that he did    Pursue Belinus at the very heels,    Was suddenly environ重 about    With all the troops of mighty Milan-land.    _Miles._ What news is this! and is it very so?    Is our Alphonsus yet in human state,    Whom all the world did judge for to be dead?    Yet can I scarce give credit to the same:    Give credit! yes, and since the Milan Duke    Hath broke his league of friendship, be he sure,    Ere Cynthia, the shining lamp of night,    Doth scale the heavens with her horn重 head,    Both he and his shall very plainly see    The league is burst that caus重 long the glee.    _Lｾli._ And could the traitor harbour in his breast    Such mortal treason 'gainst his sovereign,    As when he should with fire and sword defend    Him from his foes, he seeks his overthrow?    March on, my friends: I ne'er shall joy at all,    Until I see that bloody traitor's fall.    [_Exeunt._     _Alarum;_ BELINUS _flies, followed by_ LｮLIUS; FABIUS _flies, followed     by_ ALBINIUS; _the_ DUKE OF MILAN _flies, followed by_ MILES.ACT THE THIRDPROLOGUE _Alarum. Enter_ VENUS.    _Venus._ No sooner did Alphonsus with his troop    Set on the soldiers of Belinus' band,    But that the fury of his sturdy blows    Did strike such terror to their daunted minds    That glad was he which could escape away,    With life and limb, forth of that bloody fray.    Belinus flies unto the Turkish soil,    To crave the aid of Amurack their king;    Unto the which he willingly did consent,    And sends Belinus, with two other kings,    To know God Mahomet's pleasure in the same.    Meantime the empress by Medea's help    Did use such charms that Amurack did see,    In soundest sleep, what afterward should hap.    How Amurack did recompense her pain,    With mickle more, this act shall show you plain.    [_Exit._SCENE I.--_Camp of_ ALPHONSUS, _near Naples._ _Enter one, carrying two crowns upon a crest;_ ALPHONSUS, ALBINIUS, LｮLIUS, _and_ MILES, _with their_ Soldiers.    _Alphon._ Welcome, brave youths of Arragon, to me,    Yea, welcome, Miles, Lｾlius, and the rest,    Whose prowess alone hath been the only cause    That we, like victors, have subdu'd our foes.    Lord, what a pleasure was it to my mind,    To see Belinus, which not long before    Did with his threatenings terrify the gods,    Now scud apace from warlike Lｾlius' blows.    The Duke of Milan, he increas'd our sport,    Who doubting that his force was over-weak    For to withstand, Miles, thy sturdy arm,    Did give more credence to his frisking skips    Than to the sharpness of his cutting blade.    What Fabius did to pleasure us withal,    Albinius knows as well as I myself;    For, well I wot, if that thy tir重 steed    Had been as fresh and swift in foot as his,    He should have felt, yea, known for certainty,    To check Alphonsus did deserve to die.    Briefly, my friends and fellow-peers in arms,    The worst of you deserve such mickle praise,    As that my tongue denies for to set forth    The demi-parcel of your valiant deeds;    So that, perforce, I must by duty be    Bound to you all for this your courtesy.    _Miles._ Not so, my lord; for if our willing arms    Have pleasur'd you so much as you do say,    We have done naught but that becometh us,    For to defend our mighty sovereign.    As for my part, I count my labour small,    Yea, though it had been twice as much again,    Since that Alphonsus doth accept thereof.    _Alphon._ Thanks, worthy Miles: lest all the world    Should count Alphonsus thankless for to be,    Lｾlius, sit down, and, Miles, sit by him,    And that receive the which your swords have won.    [LｮLIUS _and_ MILES _sit down._    First, for because thou, Lｾlius, in these broils,    By martial might, didst proud Belinus chase    From troop to troop, from side to side about,    And never ceas'd from this thy swift pursuit    Until thou hadst obtain'd his royal crown,    Therefore, I say, I'll do thee naught but right,    And give thee that which thou well hast won.    [_Sets the crown on his head._    Here doth Alphonsus crown thee, Lｾlius, King    Of Naples' town, with all dominions    That erst belong重 to our traitorous foe,    That proud Belinus, in his regiment.    [_Trumpets and drums sounded._    Miles, thy share the Milan Dukedom is,    For, well I wot, thy sword deserv'd no less;    [_Sets the crown on his head._    The which Alphonsus frankly giveth thee,    In presence of his warlike men-at-arms;    And if that any stomach[43] this my deed,    Alphonsus can revenge thy wrong with speed.    [_Trumpets and drums sounded._    Now to Albinius, which in all my toils    I have both faithful, yea, and friendly, found:    Since that the gods and friendly fates assign    This present time to me to recompense    The sundry pleasures thou hast done to me,    Sit down by them, and on thy faithful head    [_Takes the crown from his own head._    Receive the crown of peerless Arragon.    _Albi._ Pardon, dear lord, Albinius at this time;    It ill becomes me for to wear a crown    Whenas my lord is destitute himself.    Why, high Alphonsus, if I should receive    This crown of you, the which high Jove forbid,    Where would yourself obtain a diadem?    Naples is gone, Milan possess重 is,    And naught is left for you but Arragon.    _Alphon._ And naught is left for me but Arragon!    Yes, surely, yes, my fates have so decreed,    That Arragon should be too base a thing    For to obtain Alphonsus for her king.    What, hear you not how that our scatter'd foes,    Belinus, Fabius, and the Milan duke,    Are fled for succour to the Turkish court?    And think you not that Amurack their king,    Will, with the mightiest power of all his land,    Seek to revenge Belinus' overthrow?    Then doubt I not but, ere these broils do end,    Alphonsus shall possess the diadem    That Amurack now wears upon his head.    Sit down theref羊e, and that receive of me    The which the fates appointed unto thee.    _Albi._ Thou King of Heaven, which by Thy power divine    Dost see the secrets of each liver's heart,    Bear record now with what unwilling mind    I do receive the crown of Arragon.    [ALBINIUS _sits down by_ LｮLIUS _and_ MILES;

therefore, Belinus, haste,    And, Claramont, go bear him company,    With King Arcastus, to the city walls:    Then bend with speed unto the darksome grove,    Where Mahomet, this many a hundred year,    Hath prophesied unto our ancestors.    Tell to his priests that Amurack, your king,    Is now selecting all his men-at-arms    To set upon that proud Alphonsus' troop:    (The cause you know, and can inform them well,    That makes me take these bloody broils in hand?)    And say that I desire their sacred god,    That Mahomet which ruleth all the skies,    To send me word, and that most speedily,    Which of us shall obtain the victory.    [_Exeunt all except_ BAJAZET _and_ AMURACK.    You, Bajazet, go post away apace    To Syria, Scythia, and Albania,    To Babylon, with Mesopotamia,    Asia, Armenia, and all other lands    Which owe their homage to high Amurack:    Charge all their kings with expedition    To gather up the chiefest men-at-arms    Which now remain in their dominions,    And on the twentieth day of the same month    To come and wait on Amurack their king,    At his chief city Constantinople.    Tell them, moreover, that, whoso doth fail,    Naught else but death from prison shall him bail.    [_Exit_ BAJAZET. _Music within._    What heavenly music soundeth in my ear?    Peace, Amurack, and hearken to the same.    [_Hearkening to the music_ AMURACK _falls asleep._     _Enter_ MEDEA, FAUSTA _and_ IPHIGENA.    _Medea._ Now have our charms fulfill'd our minds full well;    High Amurack is lull重 fast asleep,    And doubt I not but, ere he wakes again,    You shall perceive Medea did not gibe    Whenas she put this practice in your mind.    Sit, worthy Fausta, at thy spouse his feet.    Iphigena, sit thou on the other side:    [FAUSTA _and_ IPHIGENA _sit down at_ AMURACK'S _feet._    Whate'er you see, be not aghast thereat,    But bear in mind what Amurack doth chat.    [_Does ceremonies belonging to conjuring._    Thou, which wert wont, in Agamemnon's days,    To utter forth Apollo's oracles    At sacred Delphos, Calchas I do mean,    I charge thee come; all lingering set aside,    Unless the penance you thereof abide:    I c溶jure thee by Pluto's loathsome lake,    By all the hags which harbour in the same,    By stinking Styx, and filthy Phlegethon,    To come with speed, and truly to fulfil    That which Medea to thee straight shall will!    [CALCHAS _rises up,_[44] _in a white surplice and a    cardinal's mitre._    _Calc._ Thou wretched witch, when wilt thou make an end    Of troubling us with these thy curs重 charms?    What mean'st thou thus to call me from my grave?    Shall ne'er my ghost obtain his quiet rest?    _Medea._ Yes, Calchas, yes, your rest doth now approach;    Medea means to trouble thee no more,    Whenas thou hast fulfill'd her mind this once.    Go, get thee hence to Pluto back again,    And there inquire of the Destinies    How Amurack shall speed in these his wars:    Peruse their books, and mark what is decreed    By Jove himself, and all his fellow-gods;    And when thou know'st the certainty thereof,    By fleshless visions show it presently    To Amurack, in pain of penalty.    _Calc._ Forc'd by thy charm, though with unwilling mind,    I haste to hell, the certainty to find.    [_Sinks down where he came up._    _Medea._ Now, peerless princess, I must needs be gone;    My hasty business calls me from this place.    There resteth naught, but that you bear in mind    What Amurack, in this his fit, doth say;    For mark, what dreaming, madam, he doth prate,    Assure yourself that that shall be his fate.    _Fausta._ Though very loth to let thee so depart,    Farewell, Medea, easer of my heart.

[_Exit._    _Fausta._ Nay, then, I see 'tis time to look about,    Delay is dangerous, and procureth harm:    The wanton colt is tam重 in his youth;    Wounds must be cur'd when they be fresh and green;    And pleurisies, when they begin to breed,    With little care are driven away with speed.    Had Fausta then, when Amurack begun    With spiteful speeches to control and check,    Sought to prevent it by her martial force,    This banishment had never hapt to me.    But the echinus, fearing to be gor'd,    Doth keep her younglings in her paunch so long,    Till, when their pricks be waxen long and sharp,    They put their dam at length to double pain:    And I, because I loath'd the broils of Mars,    Bridled my thoughts, and press重 down my rage;    In recompense of which my good intent    I have receiv'd this woful banishment.    Woful, said I? nay, happy I did mean,    If that be happy which doth set one free;    For by this means I do not doubt ere long    But Fausta shall with ease revenge her wrong.    Come, daughter, come: my mind foretelleth me    That Amurack shall soon requited be.SCENE III.--_A Grove._ FAUSTA _and_ IPHIGENA _discovered; enter_ MEDEA, _meeting them._[46]    _Medea._ Fausta, what means this sudden flight of yours?    Why do you leave your husband's princely court,    And all alone pass through these thickest groves,    More fit to harbour brutish savage beasts    Than to receive so high a queen as you?    Although your credit would not stay your steps    From bending them into these darkish dens,    Yet should the danger, which is imminent    To every one which passeth by these paths,    Keep you at home with fair Iphigena.    What foolish toy hath tickled you to this?    I greatly fear some hap hath hit amiss.    _Fausta._ No toy, Medea, tickled Fausta's head,    Nor foolish fancy led me to these groves,    But earnest business eggs my trembling steps    To pass all dangers, whatsoe'er they be.    I banish'd am, Medea, I, which erst    Was empress over all the triple world,    Am banish'd now from palace and from pomp.    But if the gods be favourers to me,    Ere twenty days I will reveng重 be.    _Medea._ I thought as much, when first from thickest leaves    I saw you trudging in such posting pace.    But to the purpose: what may be the cause    Of this strange and sudden banishment?    _Fausta._ The cause, ask you? A simple cause, God wot;    'Twas neither treason, nor yet felony,    But for because I blam'd his foolishness.    _Medea._ I hear you say so, but I greatly fear,    Ere that your tale be brought unto an end,    You'll prove yourself the author of the same.    But pray, be brief; what folly did your spouse?    And how will you revenge your wrong on him?    _Fausta._ What folly, quoth you? Such as never yet    Was heard or seen, since Phﾏbus first 'gan shine.    You know how he was gathering in all haste    His men-at-arms, to set upon the troop    Of proud Alphonsus; yea, you well do know    How you and I did do the best we could    To make him show us in his drowsy dream    What afterward should happen in his wars.    Much talk he had, which now I have forgot;    But at the length this surely was decreed,    How that Alphonsus and Iphigena    Should be conjoin'd in Juno's sacred rites.    Which when I heard, as one that did despise    That such a traitor should be son to me,    I did rebuke my husband Amurack:    And since my words could take no better place,    My sword with help of all Amazones    Shall make him soon repent his foolishness.    _Medea._ This is the cause, then, of your banishment?    And now you go unto Amazone    To gather all your maidens in array,    To set upon the mighty Amurack?    O foolish queen, what meant you by this talk?    Those prattling speeches have undone you all.    Do you disdain to have that mighty prince,    I mean Alphonsus, counted for your son?    I tell you, Fausta, he is born to be    The ruler of a mighty monarchy.    I must confess the powers of Amurack    Be great; his confines stretch both far and near;    Yet are they not the third part of the lands    Which shall be rul重 by Alphonsus' hands:    And yet you dain to call him son-in-law.    But when you see his sharp and cutting sword    Piercing the heart of this your gallant girl,    You'll curse the hour wherein you did denay    To join Alphonsus with Iphigena.    _Fausta._ The gods forbid that e'er it happen so!    _Medea._ Nay, never pray, for it must happen so.    _Fausta._ And is there, then, no remedy for it?    _Medea,_ No, none but one, and that you have forsworn.    _Fausta._ As though an oath can bridle so my mind    As that I dare not break a thousand oaths    For to eschew the danger imminent!    Speak, good Medea, tell that way to me,    And I will do it, whatsoe'er it be.    _Medea._ Then, as already you have well decreed,    Pack to your country, and in readiness    Select the army of Amazones:    When you have done, march with your female troop    To Naples' town, to succour Amurack:    And so, by marriage of Iphigena,    You soon shall drive the danger clean away.    _Iphi._ So shall we soon eschew Charybdis' lake,    And headlong fall to Scylla's greedy gulf.    I vow'd before, and now do vow again,    Before I wed Alphonsus, I'll be slain.    _Medea._ In vain it is to strive against the stream;    Fates must be follow'd, and the gods' decree    Must needs take place in every kind of cause.    Therefore, fair maid, bridle these brutish thoughts,    And learn to follow what the fates assign.    When Saturn heard that Jupiter his son    Should drive him headlong from his heavenly seat    Down to the bottom of the dark Avern,    He did command his mother presently    To do to death the young and guiltless child:    But what of that? the mother loath'd in heart    For to commit so vile a massacre;    Yea, Jove did live, and, as the fates did say,    From heavenly seat drave Saturn clean away.    What did avail the castle all of steel,    The which Acrisius caus重 to be made    To keep his daughter Dana clogg'd in?    She was with child for all her castle's force;    And by that child Acrisius, her sire,    Was after slain, so did the fates require.    A thousand examples I could bring hereof;    But marble stones need no colouring,    And that which every one doth know for truth    Needs no examples to confirm the same.    That which the fates appoint must happen so,    Though heavenly Jove and all the gods say no.    _Fausta._ Iphigena, she sayeth naught but truth;    Fates must be follow'd in their just decrees;    And therefore, setting all delays aside,    Come, let us wend unto Amazone,    And gather up our forces out of hand.    _Iphi._ Since Fausta wills and fates do so command,    Iphigena will never it withstand.    [_Exeunt._ACT THE FOURTHPROLOGUE _Enter_ VENUS.    _Venus._ Thus have you seen how Amurack himself,    Fausta his wife, and every other king    Which hold their sceptres at the Turk his hands,    Are now in arms, intending to destroy,    And bring to naught, the Prince of Arragon.    Charms have been us'd by wise Medea's art,    To know before what afterward shall hap;    And King Belinus, with high Claramont,    Join'd to Arcastus, which with princely pomp    Doth rule and govern all the warlike Moors,    Are sent as legates to God Mahomet,    To know his counsel in these high affairs.    Mahound, provok'd by Amurack's discourse,    Which, as you heard, he in his dream did use,    Denies to play the prophet any more;    But, by the long entreaty of his priests,    He prophesies in such a crafty sort    As that the hearers needs must laugh for sport.    Yet poor Belinus, with his fellow kings,    Did give such credence to that forg重 tale    As that they lost their dearest lives thereby,    And Amurack became a prisoner    Unto Alphonsus, as straight shall appear.    [_Exit._SCENE I.--_The Temple of_ MAHOMET.     _Let there be a Brazen Head set in the middle of the place behind the     stage, out of the which cast flames of fire; drums rumble within.     Enter two_ Priests.    _First Pr._ My fellow priest of Mahound's holy house,    What can you judge of these strange miracles    Which daily happen in this sacred seat?    [_Drums rumble within._    Hark, what a rumbling rattleth in our ears!    [_Flames of fire are cast forth of the Brazen Head._    See flakes of fire proceeding from the mouth    Of Mahomet, that god of peerless power!    Nor can I tell, with all the wit I have,    What Mahomet, by these his signs, doth crave.    _Sec.

Enter_ CARINUS.    _Cari._ No sooner had God Phﾏbus' brightsome beams    Begun to dive within the western seas,    And darksome Nox had spread about the earth    Her blackish mantle, but a drowsy sleep    Did take possession of Carinus' sense,    And Morpheus show'd me strange disguis重 shapes.    Methought I saw Alphonsus, my dear son,    Plac'd in a throne all glittering clear with gold,    Bedeck'd with diamonds, pearls, and precious stones,    Which shin'd so clear, and glitter'd all so bright,    Hyperion's coach that well be term'd it might.    Above his head a canopy was set,    Not deck'd with plumes, as other princes use,    But all beset with heads of conquer'd kings,    Enstall'd with crowns, which made a gallant show,    And struck a terror to the viewers' hearts.    Under his feet lay grovelling on the ground    Thousands of princes, which he in his wars    By martial might did conquer and bring low:    Some lay as dead as either stock or stone,    Some other tumbled, wounded to the death;    But most of them, as to their sovereign king,    Did offer duly homage unto him.    As thus I stood beholding of this pomp,    Methought Alphonsus did espy me out,    And, at a trice, he leaving throne alone,    Came to embrace me in his bless重 arms.    Then noise of drums and sound of trumpets shrill    Did wake Carinus from this pleasant dream.    Something, I know, is now foreshown by this:    The gods forfend that aught should hap amiss!    [CARINUS _walks up and down._     _Enter the_ DUKE OF MILAN _in pilgrim's apparel._    _Duke of M._ This is the chance of fickle Fortune's wheel;    A prince at morn, a pilgrim ere't be night;    I, which erewhile did dain for to possess    The proudest palace of the western world,    Would now be glad a cottage for to find,    To hide my head; so Fortune hath assign'd.    Thrice Hesperus with pomp and peerless pride    Hath heav'd his head forth of the eastern seas,    Thrice Cynthia, with Phﾏbus' borrow'd beams,    Hath shown her beauty through the darkish clouds,    Since that I, wretched duke, have tasted aught,    Or drunk a drop of any kind of drink.    Instead of beds set forth with ebony,    The greenish grass hath been my resting-place,    And for my pillow stuff'd with down,    The hardish hillocks have suffic'd my turn.    Thus I, which erst had all things at my will,    A life more hard then death do follow still.    _Cari._ [_aside_]. Methinks I hear, not very far from hence,    Some woful wight lamenting his mischance:    I'll go and see if that I can espy    Him where he sits, or overhear his talk.    _Duke of M._ O Milan, Milan, little dost thou think,    How that thy duke is now in such distress!    For if thou didst, I soon should be releas'd    Forth of this greedy gulf of misery.    _Cari._ [_aside_]. The Milan Duke! I thought as much before,    When first I glanc'd mine eyes upon his face.    This is the man which was the only cause    That I was forc'd to fly from Arragon.    High Jove be prais'd which hath allotted me    So fit a time to quite that injury.--    Pilgrim, God speed.    _Duke of M._ Welcome, grave sir, to me.    _Cari._ Methought as now I heard you for to speak    Of Milan-land: pray, do you know the same?    _Duke of M._ Ay, aged father, I have cause to know    Both Milan-land and all the parts thereof.    _Cari._ Why, then, I doubt not but you can resolve    Me of a question that I shall demand.    _Duke of M._ Ay, that I can, whatever that it be.    _Cari._ Then, to be brief: not twenty winters past,    When these my limbs, which wither'd are with age,    Were in the prime and spring of all their youth,    I, still desirous, as young gallants be,    To see the fashions of Arabia,    My native soil, and in this pilgrim's weed,    Began to travel through unkenn重 lands.    Much ground I pass'd, and many soils I saw;    But when my feet in Milan-land I set,    Such sumptuous triumphs daily there I saw    As never in my life I found the like.    I pray, good sir, what might the occasion be,    That made the Milans make such mirth and glee?    _Duke of M._ This solemn joy whereof you now do speak,    Was not sol士nis重, my friend, in vain;    For at that time there came into the land    The happiest tidings that they e'er did hear;    For news was brought upon that solemn day    Unto our court, that Ferdinandus proud    Was slain himself, Carinus and his son    Was banish'd both for e'er from Arragon;    And for these happy news that joy was made.    _Cari._ But what, I pray, did afterward become    Of old Carinus with his banish'd son?    What, hear you nothing of them all this while?    _Duke of M._ Yes, too-too much, the Milan Duke may say.    Alphonsus first by secret means did get    To be a soldier in Belinus' wars,    Wherein he did behave himself so well    As that he got the crown of Arragon;    Which being got, he dispossess'd also    The King Belinus which had foster'd him.    As for Carinus he is dead and gone:    I would his son were his companion.    _Cari._ A blister build upon that traitor's tongue!    But, for thy friendship which thou showed'st me,    Take that of me, I frankly give it thee.    [_Stabs the_ DUKE OF MILAN, _who dies._    Now will I haste to Naples with all speed,    To see if Fortune will so favour me    To view Alphonsus in his happy state.SCENE III.--_Camp of_ AMURACK, _near Naples._ _Enter_ AMURACK, CROCON, FAUSTUS _and_ FABIUS, _with the_ Provost _and Turkish_ Janissaries.    _Amu._ Fabius, come hither: what is that thou sayest?    What did God Mahound prophesy to us?    Why do our viceroys wend unto the wars    Before their king had notice of the same?    What, do they think to play bob-fool with me?    Or are they wax'd so frolic now of late,    Since that they had the leading of our bands,    As that they think that mighty Amurack    Dares do no other than to soothe them up?    Why speak'st thou not? what fond or frantic fit    Did make those careless kings to venture it?    _Fabi._ Pardon, dear lord; no frantic fit at all,    No frolic vein, nor no presumptuous mind,    Did make your viceroys take these wars in hand:    But forc'd they were by Mahound's prophecy    To do the same, or else resolve to die.    _Amu._ So, sir, I hear you, but can scarce believe    That Mahomet would charge them go before,    Against Alphonsus with so small a troop,    Whose number far exceeds King Xerxes' troop.    _Fabi._ Yes, noble lord, and more than that, he said    That, ere that you, with these your warlike men,    Should come to bring your succour to the field,    Belinus, Claramont, and Arcastus too    Should all be crown'd with crowns of beaten gold,    And borne with triumph round about their tents.    _Amu._ With triumph, man! did Mahound tell them so?--    Provost, go carry Fabius presently    Unto the Marshalsea;[48] there let him rest,    Clapt sure and safe in fetters all of steel,    Till Amurack discharge him from the same;    For be he sure, unless it happen so    As he did say Mahound did prophesy,    By this my hand forthwith the slave shall die.    [_They lay hold of_ FABIUS, _and make as though to carry him out._     _Enter a_ Messenger.    _Mess._ Stay, Provost, stay, let Fabius alone:    More fitteth now that every lusty lad    Be buckling on his helmet, than to stand    In carrying soldiers to the Marshalsea.    _Amu._ Why, what art thou, that darest once presume    For to gainsay that Amurack did bid?    _Mess._ I am, my lord, the wretched'st man alive,    Born underneath the planet of mishap;    Erewhile, a soldier of Belinus' band,    But now--    _Amu._     What now?    _Mess._               The mirror of mishap;    Whose captain's slain, and all his army dead,    Only excepted me, unhappy wretch.    _Amu._ What news is this! and is Belinus slain?    Is this the crown which Mahomet did say    He should with triumph wear upon his head?    Is this the honour which that curs重 god    Did prophesy should happen to them all?    O Dｾdalus, an wert thou now alive,    To fasten wings upon high Amurack,    Mahound should know, and that for certainty,    That Turkish kings can brook no injury!    _Fabi._ Tush, tush, my lord; I wonder what you mean,    Thus to exclaim against high Mahomet:    I'll lay my life that, ere this day be past,    You shall perceive his tidings all be waste.    _Amu._ We shall perceive, accurs重 Fabius!    Suffice it not that thou hast been the man    That first didst beat those baubles in my brain,    But that, to help me forward in my grief,    Thou seekest to confirm so foul a lie?    Go, get thee hence, and tell thy traitorous king    What gift you had, which did such tidings bring.--    [_Stabs_ FABIUS, _who dies._    And now, my lords, since nothing else will serve,    Buckle your helms, clap on your steel重 coats,    Mount on your steeds, take lances in your hands;    For Amurack doth mean this very day    Proud Mahomet with weapons to assay.    _Mess._ Mercy, high monarch! it is no time now    To spend the day in such vain threatenings    Against our god, the mighty Mahomet:    More fitteth thee to place thy men-at-arms    In battle 'ray, for to withstand your foes,    Which now are drawing towards you with speed.    [_Drums sounded within._    Hark, how their drums with dub-a-dub do come!    To arms, high lord, and set these trifles by,    That you may set upon them valiantly.    _Amu._ And do they come? you kings of Turkey-[land],    Now is the time in which your warlike arms    Must raise your names above the starry skies.    Call to your mind your predecessors' acts,    Whose martial might, this many a hundred year,    Did keep those fearful dogs in dread and awe,    And let your weapons show Alphonsus plain,    That though that they be clapp重 up in clay,    Yet there be branches sprung up from those trees,    In Turkish land, which brook no injuries.    Besides the same, remember with yourselves    What foes we have; not mighty Tamburlaine,    Nor soldiers train重 up amongst the wars,    But fearful boors, pick'd from their rural flock,    Which, till this time, were wholly ignorant    What weapons meant, or bloody Mars doth crave.    More would I say, but horses that be free    Do need no spurs, and soldiers which themselves    Long and desire to buckle with the foe,    Do need no words to egg them to the same. _Enter_ ALPHONSUS, _with a canopy carried over him by three_ Lords, _having over each corner a king's head crowned; with him_ ALBINIUS, LｮLIUS _and_ MILES _with crowns on their heads, and their_ Soldiers.    Besides the same, behold whereas our foes    Are marching towards us most speedily.    Courage, my lords, ours is the victory.    _Alphon._ Thou pagan dog, how dar'st thou be so bold    To set thy foot within Alphonsus' land?    What, art thou come to view thy wretched kings,    Whose traitorous heads bedeck my tent so well?    Or else, thou hearing that on top thereof    There is a place left vacant, art thou come    To have thy head possess the highest seat?    If it be so, lie down, and this my sword    Shall presently that honour thee afford.    If not, pack hence, or by the heavens I vow,    Both thou and thine shall very soon perceive    That he that seeks to move my patience    Must yield his life to me for recompense.    _Amu._ Why, proud Alphonsus, think'st thou Amurack,    Whose mighty force doth terrify the gods,    Can e'er be found to turn his heels, and fly    Away for fear from such a boy as thou?    No, no, although that Mars this mickle while    Hath fortified thy weak and feeble arm,    And Fortune oft hath view'd with friendly face    Thy armies marching victors from the field,    Yet at the presence of high Amurack    Fortune shall change, and Mars, that god of might,    Shall succour me, and leave Alphonsus quite.    _Alphon._ Pagan, I say thou greatly art deceiv'd:    I clap up Fortune in a cage of gold,    To make her turn her wheel as I think best;    And as for Mars whom you do say will change,    He moping sits behind the kitchen-door,    Prest at command of every scullion's mouth,    Who dares not stir, nor once to move a whit,    For fear Alphonsus then should stomach it.    _Amu._ Blasp-h士-ous dog, I wonder that the earth    Doth cease from renting underneath thy feet,    To swallow up that canker'd corpse of thine.    I muse that Jove can bridle so his ire    As, when he hears his brother so misus'd,    He can refrain from sending thunderbolts    By thick and threefold, to revenge his wrong.    Mars fight for me, and fortune be my guide!    And I'll be victor, whatsome'er betide.    _Albi._ Pray loud enough,[49] lest that you pray in vain:    Perhaps God Mars and Fortune are asleep.    _Amu._ An Mars lies slumbering on his downy bed,    Yet do not think but that the power we have,    Without the help of those celestial gods,    Will be sufficient, yea, with small ado,    Alphonsus' straggling army to subdue.    _Lｾli._ You had need as then to call for Mahomet,    With hellish hags to perform the same.    _Faustus._ High Amurack, I wonder what you mean,    That, when you may, with little toil or none,    Compel these dogs to keep their tongues in peace,    You let them stand still barking in this sort:    Believe me, sovereign, I do blush to see    These beggar's brats to chat so frolicly.    _Alphon._ How now, sir boy! Let Amurack himself,    Or any he, the proudest of you all,    But offer once for to unsheath his sword,    If that he dares, for all the power you have.    _Amu._ What, dar'st thou us? myself will venture it.--    To arms, my mate! [AMURACK _draws his sword_; ALPHONSUS _and all the other_ Kings _draw theirs.

Enter_ VENUS.    _Venus._ Fierce is the fight, and bloody is the broil.    No sooner had the roaring cannon shot    Spit forth the venom of their fir重 paunch,    And with their pellets sent such troops of souls    Down to the bottom of the dark Avern,    As that it cover'd all the Stygian fields;    But, on a sudden, all the men-at-arms,    Which mounted were on lusty coursers' backs,    Did rush together with so great a noise    As that I thought the giants one time more    Did scale the heavens, as erst they did before.    Long time dame Fortune temper'd so her wheel    As that there was no vantage to be seen    On any side, but equal was the gain;    But at the length, so God and Fates decreed,    Alphonsus was the victor of the field,    And Amurack became his prisoner;    Who so remain'd, until his daughter came,    And by her marrying did his pardon frame.

Alarum: as_ CROCON _and_ FAUSTUS _are flying, enter_ FAUSTA _and_ IPHIGENA, _with their army, meeting them._    _Fausta._ You Turkish kings, what sudden flight is this?    What mean the men, which for their valiant prowess    Were dreaded erst clean through the triple world,    Thus cowardly to turn their backs and fly?    What froward fortune happen'd on your side?    I hope your king in safety doth abide?    _Cro._ Ay, noble madam, Amurack doth live,    And long I hope he shall enjoy his life;    But yet I fear, unless more succour come,    We shall both lose our king and sovereign.    _Fausta._ How so, King Crocon? dost thou speak in jest,    To prove if Fausta would lament his death?    Or else hath anything hapt him amiss?    Speak quickly, Crocon, what the cause might be,    That thou dost utter forth these words to me.    _Cro._ Then, worthy Fausta, know that Amurack    Our mighty king, and your approv重 spouse,    Prick'd with desire of everlasting fame,    As he was pressing in the thickest ranks    Of Arragonians, was, with much ado,    At length took prisoner by Alphonsus' hands.    So that, unless you succour soon do bring,    You lose your spouse, and we shall want our king.    _Iphi._ O hapless hap, O dire and cruel fate!    What injury hath Amurack, my sire,    Done to the gods, which now I know are wroth,    Although unjustly and without a cause?    For well I wot, not any other king,    Which now doth live, or since the world begun    Did sway a sceptre, had a greater care    To please the gods than mighty Amurack:    And for to quite our father's great good-will,    Seek they thus basely all his fame to spill?    _Fausta._ Iphigena, leave off these woful tunes:    It is not words can cure and case this wound,    But warlike swords; not tears, but sturdy spears.    High Amurack is prisoner to our foes:    What then? Think you that our Amazones,    Join'd with the forces of the Turkish troop,    Are not sufficient for to set him free?    Yes, daughter, yes, I mean not for to sleep    Until he is free, or we him company keep.--    March on, my mates. [_Exeunt._SCENE II.--_Another Part of the Field._ _Alarum: enter_ ALPHONSUS _in flight, followed by_ IPHIGENA.    _Iphi._ How now, Alphonsus! you which never yet    Could meet your equal in the feats of arms,    How haps it now that in such sudden sort    You fly the presence of a silly maid?    What, have you found mine arm of such a force    As that you think your body over-weak    For to withstand the fury of my blows?    Or do you else disdain to fight with me,    For staining of your high nobility?    _Alphon._ No, dainty dame, I would not have thee think    That ever thou or any other wight    Shall live to see Alphonsus fly the field    From any king or keisar whosome'er:    First will I die in thickest of my foe,    Before I will disbase mine honour so.    Nor do I scorn, thou goddess, for to stain    My prowess with thee, although it be a shame    For knights to combat with the female sect:[50]    But love, sweet mouse, hath so benumbed my wit,    That, though I would, I must refrain from it.    _Iphi._ I thought as much when first I came to wars;    Your noble acts were fitter to be writ    Within the tables of Dame Venus' son,    Than in God Mars his warlike registers:    Whenas your lords are hacking helms abroad,    And make their spears to shiver in the air,    Your mind is busied in fond Cupid's toys.    Come on, i' faith, I'll teach you for to know    We came to fight, and not to love, I trow.    _Alphon._  Nay, virgin, stay. An if thou wilt vouchsafe    To entertain Alphonsus' simple suit,    Thou shalt ere long be monarch of the world:    All christen'd kings, with all your pagan dogs,    Shall bend their knees unto Iphigena;    The Indian soil shall be thine at command,    Where every step thou settest on the ground    Shall be receiv重 on the golden mines;    Rich Pactolus,[51] that river of account,    Which doth descend from top of Tmolus Mount,    Shall be thine own, and all the world beside,    If you will grant to be Alphonsus' bride.    _Iphi._ Alphonsus' bride! nay, villain, do not think    That fame or riches can so rule my thoughts    As for to make me love and fancy him    Whom I do hate, and in such sort despise,    As, if my death could bring to pass his bane,    I would not long from Pluto's port remain.    _Alphon._ Nay, then, proud peacock, since thou art so stout    As that entreaty will not move thy mind    For to consent to be my wedded spouse,    Thou shalt, in spite of gods and fortune too,    Serve high Alphonsus as a concubine.    _Iphi._ I'll rather die than ever that shall hap._Alphon._ And thou shalt die unless it come to pass.[ALPHONSUS _and_ IPHIGENA _fight._ IPHIGENA _flies followed by_ALPHONSUS.SCENE III.--_The Camp of_ ALPHONSUS. _Alarum. Enter_ ALPHONSUS _with his rapier,_ ALBINIUS, LｮLIUS, MILES, _with their_ Soldiers; AMURACK, FAUSTA, IPHIGENA, CROCON, _and_ FAUSTUS, _all bound, with their hands behind them._ AMURACK _looks angrily on_ FAUSTA. _Enter_ MEDEA.    _Medea._ Nay, Amurack, this is no time to jar:    Although thy wife did, in her frantic mood,    Use speeches which might better have been spar'd,    Yet do thou not judge this same time to be    A season to requite that injury.    More fitteth thee, with all the wit thou hast,    To call to mind which way thou mayst release    Thyself, thy wife, and fair Iphigena,    Forth of the power of stout Alphonsus' hands;    For, well I wot, since first you breath重 breath,    You never were so nigh the snares of death.    Now, Amurack, your high and kingly seat,    Your royal sceptre, and your stately crown,    Your mighty country, and your men-at-arms,    Be conquer'd all, and can no succour bring.    Put, then, no trust in these same paltry toys,    But call to mind that thou a prisoner art,    Clapt up in chains, whose life and death depend    Upon the hands of thy most mortal foe.    Then take thou heed, that whatsome'er he say,    Thou dost not once presume for to gainsay.    _Amu._ Away, you fool! think you your curs重 charms    Can bridle so the mind of Amurack    As that he will stand crouching to his foe?    No, no, be sure that, if that beggar's brat    Do dare but once to contrary my will,    I'll make him soon in heart for to repent    That e'er such words 'gainst Amurack he spent.    _Medea._ Then, since thou dost disdain my good advice,    Look to thyself, and if you fare amiss,    Remember that Medea counsel gave,    Which might you safe from all those perils save.    But, Fausta, you, as well you have begun,    Beware you follow still your friend's advice:    If that Alphonsus do desire of thee    To have your daughter for his wedded spouse,    Beware you do not once the same gainsay,    Unless with death he do your rashness pay.    _Fausta._ No, worthy wight; first Fausta means to die    Before Alphonsus she will contrary.    _Medea._ Why, then, farewell.--But you, Iphigena,    Beware you do not over-squeamish wax,    Whenas your mother giveth her consent.    _Iphi._ The gods forbid that e'er I should gainsay    That which Medea bids me to obey. [_Exit_ MEDEA. ALPHONSUS, _who all this while has been talking to_ ALBINIUS, _rises up out of his chair._    _Alphon._ Now, Amurack, the proud blasph士ous dogs,    For so you term'd us, which did brawl and rail    Against God Mars, and fickle Fortune's wheel,    Have got the goal for all your solemn prayers.    Yourself are prisoner, which as then did think    That all the forces of the triple world    Were insufficient to fulfil the same.    How like you this? Is Fortune of such might,    Or hath God Mars such force or power divine,    As that he can, with all the power he hath,    Set thee and thine forth of Alphonsus' hands?    I do not think but that your hope's so small    As that you would with very willing mind    Yield for my spouse the fair Iphigena,    On that condition, that without delay    Fausta and you may scot-free 'scape away.    _Amu._ What, think'st thou, villain, that high Amurack    Bears such a mind as, for the fear of death,    He'll yield his daughter, yea, his only joy,    Into the hands of such a dunghill-knight?    No, traitor, no; for [though] as now I lie    Clapt up in irons and with bolts of steel,    Yet do there lurk within the Turkish soil    Such troops of soldiers that, with small ado,    They'll set me scot-free from your men and you.    _Alphon._ "Villain," say'st thou? "traitor" and "dunghill-knight"?    Now, by the heavens, since that thou dost deny    For to fulfil that which in gentle wise    Alphonsus craves, both thou and all thy train    Shall with your lives requite that injury.--    Albinius, lay hold of Amurack,    And carry him to prison presently,    There to remain until I do return    Into my tent; for by high Jove I vow,    Unless he wax more calmer out of hand,    His head amongst his fellow-kings shall stand.    _Amu._ No, villain, think not that the fear of death    Shall make me calmer while I draw my breath.    [_Exit in custody of_ ALBINIUS.    _Alphon._ Now, Lｾlius, take you Iphigena,    Her mother Fausta, with these other kings,    And put them into prisons severally;    For Amurack's stout stomach shall undo    Both he himself and all his other crew.    _Fausta_ [_kneeling_]. O sacred prince, if that the salt brine tears,    Distilling down poor Fausta's wither'd cheeks,    Can mollify the hardness of your heart,    Lessen this judgment, which thou in thy rage    Hast given on thy luckless prisoners.    _Alphon._ Woman, away! my word is gone and past;    Now, if I would, I cannot call it back.    You might have yielded at my first demand,    And then you needed not to fear this hap.--    [FAUSTA _rises._    Lｾlius make haste, and go thou presently    For to fulfil that I commanded thee.    _Iphi_ [_kneeling_]. Mighty Alphonsus, since my mother's suit    Is so rejected that in any case    You will not grant us pardon for her sake,    I now will try if that my woful prayers    May plead for pity at your grace's feet.    When first you did, amongst the thickest ranks,    All clad in glittering arms encounter me,    You know yourself what love you did protest    You then did bear unto Iphigena:    Then for that love, if any love you had,    Revoke this sentence, which is too-too bad.    _Alphon._ No, damsel; he that will not when he may,    When he desires, shall surely purchase nay:    If that you had, when first I proffer made,    Yielded to me, mark, what I promis'd you    I would have done; but since you did deny,    Look for denial at Alphonsus' hands.    [IPHIGENA _rises, and stands aside._ ALPHONSUS _talks with_ ALBINIUS.     _Enter_ CARINUS _in pilgrim's apparel._    _Cari._ [_aside_]. O friendly Fortune, now thou show'st thy power    In raising up my son from banish'd state    Unto the top of thy most mighty wheel!    But, what be these which at his sacred feet    Do seem to plead for mercy at his hands?    I'll go and sift this matter to the full.    [_Goes toward_ ALPHONSUS, _and speaks to one of his soldiers._    Sir knight, an may a pilgrim be so bold    To put your person to such mickle pain    For to inform me what great king is this,    And what these be, which, in such woful sort,    Do seem to seek for mercy at his hands?    _Sol._ Pilgrim, the king that sits on stately throne    Is call'd Alphonsus; and this matron hight    Fausta, the wife to Amurack the Turk;    That is their daughter, fair Iphigena;    Both which, together with the Turk himself,    He did take prisoners in a battle fought.    _Alphon._ [_spying out_ CARINUS].    And can the gods be found so kind to me    As that Carinus now I do espy?    'Tis he indeed.--Come on, Albinius:    The mighty conquest which I have achiev'd,    And victories the which I oft have won,    Bring not such pleasure to Alphonsus' heart    As now my father's presence doth impart.    [ALPHONSUS _and_ ALBINIUS _go toward_ CARINUS: ALPHONSUS _stands    looking on him._    _Cari._ What, ne'er a word, Alphonsus? art thou dumb?    Or doth my presence so perturb thy mind    That, for because I come in pilgrim's weed,    You think each word which you do spend to me    A great disgrace unto your name to be?    Why speak'st thou not? if that my place you crave,    I will be gone, and you my place shall have.    _Alphon._ Nay, father, stay; the gods of heaven forbid    That e'er Alphonsus should desire or wish    To have his absence whom he doth account    To be the loadstar[52] of his life!    What, though the Fates and Fortune, both in one,    Have been content to call your loving son    From beggar's state unto this princely seat,    Should I therefore disdain my ag重 sire?    No, first both crown and life I will detest,    Before such venom breed within my breast.    What erst I did, the sudden joy I took    To see Carinus in such happy state,    Did make me do, and nothing else at all,    High Jove himself do I to witness call.    _Cari._ These words are vain; I knew as much before.    But yet, Alphonsus, I must wonder needs    That you, whose years are prone to Cupid's snares,    Can suffer such a goddess as this dame    Thus for to shed such store of crystal tears.    Believe me, son, although my years be spent,    Her sighs and sobs in twain my heart do rent.    _Alphon._ Like power, dear father, had she over me,    Until for love I looking to receive    Love back again, not only was denied,    But also taunted in most spiteful sort:    Which made me loathe that which I erst did love,    As she herself, with all her friends, shall prove.    _Cari._ How now, Alphonsus! you which have so long    Been train重 up in bloody broils of Mars,    What, know you not that castles are not won    At first assault, and women are not woo'd    When first their suitors proffer love to them?    As for my part, I should account that maid    A wanton wench, unconstant, lewd, and light,    That yields the field before she venture fight;    Especially unto her mortal foe,    As you were then unto Iphigena.    But, for because I see you fitter are    To enter lists and combat with your foes    Than court fair ladies in God Cupid's tents,    Carinus means your spokesman for to be,    And if that she consent, you shall agree.    _Alphon._ What you command Alphonsus must not fly,    Though otherwise perhaps he would deny.    _Cari._ Then, dainty damsel, stint these trickling tears,    Cease sighs and sobs, yea, make a merry cheer;    Your pardon is already purchas重,    So that you be not over-curious[53]    In granting to Alphonsus' just demand.    _Iphi._ Thanks, mighty prince; no curioser I'll be    Than doth become a maid of my degree.    _Cari._ The gods forbid that e'er Carinus' tongue    Should go about to make a maid consent    Unto the thing which modesty denies:    That which I ask is neither hurt to thee,    Danger to parents, nor disgrace to friends,    But good and honest, and will profit bring    To thee and those which lean unto that thing.    And that is this:--since first Alphonsus' eyes    Did hap to glance upon your heavenly hue,    And saw the rare perfection of the same,    He hath desir重 to become your spouse:    Now, if you will unto the same agree,    I dare assure you that you shall be free.    _Iphi._ Pardon, dear lord; the world goes very hard    When womenkind are forc重 for to woo.    If that your son had lov重 me so well,    Why did he not inform me of the same?    _Cari._ Why did he not! what, have you clean forgot    What ample proffers he did make to you,    When, hand to hand, he did encounter you?    _Iphi._ No, worthy sir, I have not it forgot;    But Cupid cannot enter in the breast    Where Mars before had took possession:    That was no time to talk of Venus' games    When all our fellows were press'd in the wars.    _Cari._ Well, let that pass: now canst thou be content    To love Alphonsus and become his spouse?    _Iphi._ Ay, if the high Alphonsus could vouchsafe    To entertain me as his wedded spouse.    _Alphon._ If that he could! what, dost thou doubt of that?    Jason did jet[54] whenas he had obtain'd    The golden fleece by wise Medea's art;    The Greeks rejoic重 when they had subdu'd    The famous bulwarks of most stately Troy;    But all their mirth was nothing in respect    Of this my joy, since that I now have got    That which I long desir重 in my heart.    _Cari._ But what says Fausta to her daughter's choice?    _Fausta._ Fausta doth say, the gods have been her friends,    To let her live to see Iphigena    Bestow重 so unto her heart's content.    _Alphon._ Thanks, mighty empress, for your gentleness,    And, if Alphonsus can at any time    With all his power requite this courtesy,    You shall perceive how kindly he doth take    Your forwardness in this his happy chance.    _Cari._ Albinius, go call forth Amurack:    We'll see what he doth say unto this match.    [ALBINIUS _brings forth_ AMURACK.    Most mighty Turk, I, with my warlike son    Alphonsus, loathing that so great a prince    As you should live in such unseemly sort,    Have sent for you to proffer life or death;    Life, if you do consent to our demand,    And death, if that you dare gainsay the same.    Your wife, high Fausta, with Iphigena,    Have given consent that this my warlike son    Should have your daughter for his bedfellow:    Now resteth naught but that you do agree,    And so to purchase sure tranquillity.    _Amu._ [_aside_]. Now, Amurack, advise thee what thou say'st;    Bethink thee well what answer thou wilt make:    Thy life and death dependeth on thy words.    If thou deny to be Alphonsus' sire,    Death is thy share; but if that thou consent,    Thy life is sav'd. Consent! nay, rather die:    Should I consent to give Iphigena    Into the hands of such a beggar's brat?    What, Amurack, thou dost deceive thyself;    Alphonsus is the son unto a king:    What then? then worthy of thy daughter's love.    She is agreed, and Fausta is content;    Then Amurack will not be discontent.    [_Takes_ IPHIGENA _by the hand, and gives her to_ ALPHONSUS.    Here, brave Alphonsus, take thou at my hand    Iphigena, I give her unto thee;    And for her dowry, when her father dies,    Thou shalt possess the Turkish empery.    Take her, I say, and live King Nestor's years:    So would the Turk and all his noble peers.    _Alphon._ Immortal thanks I give unto your grace.    _Cari._ Now, worthy princes, since, by help of Jove,    On either side the wedding is decreed,    Come, let us wend to Naples speedily    For to sol士nise it with mirth and glee.    _Amu._ As you do will, we jointly do agree.    [_Exeunt omnes._EPILOGUE _Enter_ VENUS _with the_ Muses.    _Venus._ Now, worthy Muses, with unwilling mind    Venus is forc'd to trudge to heaven again,    For Jupiter, that god of peerless power,    Proclaimed hath a solemn festival    In honour of Dame Dana's luckless death;    Unto the which, in pain of his displeasure,    He hath invited all the immortal gods    And goddesses, so that I must be there,    Unless I will his high displeasure bear.    You see Alphonsus hath, with much ado,    At length obtained fair Iphigena,    Of Amurack her father, for his wife;    Who now are going to the temple wards,    For to perform Dame Juno's sacred rites;    Where we will leave them, till the feast be done,    Which, in the heavens, by this time is begun.    Meantime, dear Muses, wander you not far    Forth of the path of high Parnassus' hill,    That, when I come to finish up his life,[55]    You may be ready for to succour me:    Adieu, dear dames; farewell, Calliope.    _Cal._ Adieu, you sacred goddess of the sky.    [_Exit_ VENUS; _or, if you can conveniently, let a chair come down    from the top of the stage, and draw her up._    Well, loving sisters, since that she is gone,    Come, let us haste unto Parnassus' hill,    As Cytherea did lately will.    _Melpom._ Then make you haste her mind for to fulfil.    [_Exeunt omnes, playing on their instruments._

Author: Roberte GreeneTitle: A LOOKING-GLASS FOR LONDON AND ENGLAND_A Looking-Glass for London and England_ is first mentioned inHenslowe's _Diary_ as performed by Lord Strange's servants, 8th March1592. At this time it was not a new play, and it is probable that ithad first belonged to the Queen's players, to whom Greene was attached,and that it was by them turned over to Strange's company along withseveral other plays when the Queen's company went to the provincesin 1591. Henslowe records four performances of the play between 8thMarch and 7th June 1592. It was printed by Thomas Creede and enteredon the _Stationers' Registers_, 5th March 1594, as written by ThomasLodge and Robert Greene, gent. There is every indication that theplay was successful. For two decades after its appearance Jonah andthe Whale were popular in puppet-shows, and allusions in Beaumontand Fletcher, Ben Jonson and Cowley indicate the vogue of Ninevehon the puppet-stage. Five early quartos are mentioned by Collins:1594, in the library of the Duke of Devonshire; 1598, in the Bodleianand the British Museum; 1602, in the British Museum; 1617, in theBodleian and the British Museum; and apparently an actor's editionwith many variants, formerly in Heber's Library, now in that of MrGodfrey Locker Lampson, of the conjectural date 1598. The assignmentof authorship of different portions of the play is difficult and notentirely profitable. Fleay assigns "most and best" of the play toLodge. From their resemblance to the _Alarum Against Usurers_ Collinsassigns the following scenes to Lodge: I. 3; II. 3; V. 2. He alsoassigns the speeches of Oseas and Jonas, and the scenes displayingmarine technology, to Lodge, viz.: III. 2; IV. 1. (_See_ also Gayley,_Representative English Comedies_, p 405, n.) This play was one of theearliest in which Greene had a hand and has been rightly called "amodernised morality."DRAMATIS PERSONÆRASNI, King of Nineveh.KING OF CILICIA.KING OF CRETE.KING OF PAPHLAGONIA.THRASYBULUS, a young gentleman, reduced to poverty.ALCON, a poor man.RADAGON,CLESIPHON,his sons.Usurer.Judge.Lawyer.Smith.ADAM, his man.First Ruffian.Second Ruffian.Governor of Joppa.Master of a Ship.First Searcher.Second Searcher.A Man in devil's attire.Magi, Merchants, Sailors, Lords, Attendants, etc.REMILIA, sister to RASNI.ALVIDA, wife to the KING OF PAPHLAGONIA.SAMIA, wife to ALCON.Smith's Wife.Ladies.An Angel.An Evil Angel.OSEAS.JONAS._A LOOKING-GLASS FOR LONDON AND ENGLAND_ACT THE FIRSTSCENE I.--_The Palace of_ RASNI _in Nineveh._ _Enter_ RASNI, _with the_ KINGS OF CILICIA, CRETE _and_ PAPHLAGONIA, _from the overthrow of_ JEROBOAM, _King of Jerusalem._    _Rasni._ So pace ye on, triumphant warriors;    Make Venus' leman,[56] arm'd in all his pomp,    Bash at the brightness of your hardy looks;    For you, the viceroys and the cavaliers,    That wait on Rasni's royal mightiness:--    Boast, petty kings, and glory in your fates,    That stars have made your fortunes climb so high,    To give attend on Rasni's excellence.    Am I not he that rules great Nineveh,    Rounded with Lycus' silver-flowing streams?    Whose city-large diametri contains,    Even three days' journey's length from wall to wall;    Two hundred gates carv'd out of burnish'd brass,    As glorious as the portal of the sun;    And, for to deck heaven's battlements with pride,    Six hundred towers that topless touch the clouds.    This city is the footstool of your king;    A hundred lords do honour at my feet;    My sceptre straineth both the parallels:    And now t' enlarge the highness of my power    I have made Judea's monarch flee the field,    And beat proud Jeroboam from his holds,    Winning from Cadiz to Samaria.    Great Jewry's God, that foil'd stout Benhadad,    Could not rebate[57] the strength that Rasni brought;    For be he God in heaven, yet, viceroys, know,    Rasni is god on earth, and none but he.    _K. of Cil._ If lovely shape, feature by nature's skill    Passing in beauty fair Endymion's,    That Luna wrapt within her snowy breasts,    Or that sweet boy that wrought bright Venus' bane,    Transform'd unto a purple hyacinth;    If beauty nonpareil in excellence,    May make a king match with the gods in gree,[58]    Rasni is god on earth, and none but he.    _K. of Crete._ If martial looks, wrapt in a cloud of wars,    More fierce than Mavors lighteneth from his eyes,    Sparkling revenge and dire disparagement;    If doughty deeds more haught than any done,    Seal'd with the smile of fortune and of fate,    Matchless to manage lance and curtle-axe;    If such high actions, grac'd with victories,    May make a king match with the gods in gree,    Rasni is god on earth, and none but he.    _K. of Paph._ If Pallas' wealth--    _Rasni._ Viceroys, enough; peace, Paphlagon, no more.    See where's my sister, fair Remilia,    Fairer than was the virgin Danaë    That waits on Venus with a golden show;    She that hath stol'n the wealth of Rasni's looks,    And tied his thoughts within her lovely locks,    She that is lov'd, and love unto your king,    See where she comes to gratulate my fame. _Enter_ RADAGON, _with_ REMILIA, ALVIDA, _and_ Ladies, _bringing a globe seated on a ship._    _Remil._ Victorious monarch, second unto Jove    Mars upon earth, and Neptune on the seas,    Whose frown strows all the ocean with a calm,    Whose smile draws Flora to display her pride,    Whose eye holds wanton Venus at a gaze,    Rasni, the regent of great Nineveh;    For thou hast foil'd proud Jeroboam's force,    And, like the mustering breath of Æolus,    That overturns the pines of Lebanon,    Hast scatter'd Jewry and her upstart grooms,    Winning from Cadiz to Samaria;--    Remilia greets thee with a kind salute,    And, for a present to thy mightiness,    Gives thee a globe folded within a ship,    As king on earth and lord of all the seas,    With such a welcome unto Nineveh    As may thy sister's humble love afford.    _Rasni._ Sister! the title fits not thy degree;    A higher state of honour shall be thine.    The lovely trull that Mercury entrapp'd    Within the curious pleasure of his tongue,    And she that bash'd the sun-god with her eyes,    Fair Semele, the choice of Venus' maids,    Were not so beauteous as Remilia.    Then, sweeting, sister shall not serve the turn,    But Rasni's wife, his leman and his love:    Thou shalt, like Juno, wed thyself to Jove,    And fold me in the riches of thy fair;[59]    Remilia shall be Rasni's paramour.    For why,[60] if I be Mars for warlike deeds,    And thou bright Venus for thy clear aspect,    Why should not from our loins issue a son    That might be lord of royal sovereignty,    Of twenty worlds, if twenty worlds might be?    What say'st, Remilia, art thou Rasni's wife?    _Remil._ My heart doth swell with favour of thy thoughts;    The love of Rasni maketh me as proud    As Juno when she wore heaven's diadem.    Thy sister born was for thy wife, my love:    Had I the riches nature locketh up    To deck her darling beauty when she smiles,    Rasni should prank him in the pride of all.    _Rasni._ Remilia's love is far more richer[61] priz'd    Than Jeroboam's or the world's subdue.    Lordings, I'll have my wedding sumptuous,    Made glorious with the treasures of the world:    I'll fetch from Albia shelves of margarites,[62]    And strip the Indies of their diamonds,    And Tyre shall yield me tribute of her gold,    To make Remilia's wedding glorious.    I'll send for all the damosel queens that live    Within the reach of Rasni's government,    To wait as hand-maids on Remilia,    That her attendant train may pass the troop    That gloried Venus at her wedding-day.    _K. of Crete._ O my Lord, not sister to thy love!    'Tis incest and too foul a fact for kings;    Nature allows no limits to such lust.    _Radag._ Presumptuous viceroy, dar'st thou check thy lord,    Or twit him with the laws that nature loves?    Is not great Rasni above nature's reach,    God upon earth, and all his will is law?    _K. of Crete._ O, flatter not, for hateful is his choice,    And sister's love will blemish all his worth.    _Radag._ Doth not the brightness of his majesty    Shadow his deeds from being counted faults?    _Rasni._ Well hast thou answer'd with him, Radagon;    I like thee for thy learnèd sophistry.--    But thou of Crete, that countercheck'st thy king,    Pack hence in exile;--Radagon the crown!--    Be thou vicegerent of his royalty,    And fail me not in what my thoughts may please,    For from a beggar have I brought thee up,    And grac'd thee with the honour of a crown.--    Ye quondam king, what, feed ye on delays?    _K. of Crete._ Better no king than viceroy under him,    That hath no virtue to maintain his crown. [_Exit._    _Rasni._ Remilia, what fair dames be those that wait    Attendant on thy matchless royalty?    _Remil._ 'Tis Alvida, the fair wife to the King of Paphlagonia.    _Rasni._ Trust me, she is a fair:--thou'st, Paphlagon, a jewel,    To fold thee in so bright a sweeting's arms.    _Radag._ Like you her, my lord?    _Rasni._ What if I do, Radagon?    _Radag._ Why, then she is yours, my lord; for marriage    Makes no exception, where Rasni doth command.    _K. of Paph._ Ill dost thou counsel him to fancy wives.    _Radag._ Wife or not wife, whatso he likes is his.    _Rasni._ Well answer'd, Radagon; thou art for me:    Feed thou mine humour, and be still a king.--    Lords, go in triumph of my happy loves,    And, for to feast us after all our broils,    Frolic and revel it in Nineveh.    Whatso'er befitteth your conceited thoughts,    Or good or ill, love or not love, my boys,    In love, or what may satisfy your lust,    Act it, my lords, for no man dare say no.    _Divisum imperium cum Jove nunc teneo._    [_Exeunt._SCENE II.--_A Public Place in Nineveh._ _Enter, brought in by an_ Angel, OSEAS, _the Prophet, and let down over the stage in a throne._    _Angel._ Amaze not, man of God, if in the spirit    Thou'rt brought from Jewry unto Nineveh;    So was Elias wrapt within a storm,    And set upon Mount Carmel by the Lord:    For thou hast preach'd long to the stubborn Jews,    Whose flinty hearts have felt no sweet remorse,    But lightly valuing all the threats of God,    Have still perséver'd in their wickedness.    Lo, I have brought thee unto Nineveh,    The rich and royal city of the world,    Pamper'd in wealth, and overgrown with pride,    As Sodom and Gomorrah full of sin.    The Lord looks down, and cannot see one good,    Not one that covets to obey His will;    But wicked all, from cradle to the crutch.    Note, then, Oseas, all their grievous sins,    And see the wrath of God that pays revenge;    And when the ripeness of their sin is full,    And thou hast written all their wicked thoughts,    I'll carry thee to Jewry back again,    And seat thee in the great Jerusalem;    There shalt thou publish in her open streets    That God sends down His hateful wrath for sin    On such as never heard His prophets speak:    Much more will He inflict a world of plagues    On such as hear the sweetness of His voice,    And yet obey not what His prophets speak.    Sit thee, Oseas, pondering in the spirit    The mightiness of these fond people's[63] sins.    _Oseas._ The will of the Lord be done!    [_Exit_ Angel. _Enter_ ADAM[64] _and his crew of_ Ruffians, _to go to drink.__Ruffian._ Come on, smith, thou shalt be one of the crew, because thouknowest where the best ale in the town is._Adam._ Come on, in faith, my colts; I have left my master striking ofa heat, and stole away because I would keep you company._First Ruf._ Why, what, shall we have this paltry smith with us?_Adam._ "Paltry smith"! why, you incarnative knave, what are you thatyou speak petty treason against the smith's trade?_First Ruf._ Why, slave, I am a gentleman of Nineveh._Adam._ A gentleman! good sir, I remember you well, and all yourprogenitors: your father bare office in our town; an honest man he was,and in great discredit in the parish, for they bestowed two squires'livings on him, the one was on working-days, and then he kept the townstage, and on holidays they made him the sexton's man, for he whippeddogs out of the church. Alas, sir, your father,--why, sir, methinks Isee the gentleman still: a proper youth he was, faith, aged some fortyand ten; his beard rat's colour, half black, half white; his nose wasin the highest degree of noses, it was nose _autem glorificam_,[65] soset with rubies that after his death it should have been nailed up inCopper-smiths-hall for a monument. Well, sir, I was beholding to yourgood father, for he was the first man that ever instructed me in themystery of a pot of ale._Second Ruf._ Well said, smith; that crossed him over the thumbs._First Ruf._ Villain, were it not that we go to be merry, my rapiershould presently quit[66] thy opproprious terms._Adam._ O Peter, Peter, put up thy sword, I prithee heartily, into thyscabbard; hold in your rapier; for though I have not a long reacher,I have a short hitter.--Nay then, gentlemen, stay me, for my cholerbegins to rise against him; for mark the words, "a paltry smith"!O horrible sentence! thou hast in these words, I will stand to it,libelled against all the sound horses, whole horses, sore horses,coursers, curtals, jades, cuts, hackneys and mares: whereupon, myfriend, in their defence, I give thee this curse,--thou shalt not beworth a horse of thine own this seven year._First Ruf._ I prithee, smith, is your occupation so excellent?_Adam._ "A paltry smith"! Why, I'll stand to it, a smith is lord of thefour elements; for our iron is made of the earth, our bellows blow outair, our floor holds fire, and our forge water. Nay, sir, we read inthe Chronicles that there was a god of our occupation._First Ruf._ Ay, but he was a cuckold._Adam._ That was the reason, sir, he call'd your father cousin. "Paltrysmith"! Why, in this one word thou hast defaced their worshipfuloccupation._First Ruf._ As how?_Adam._ Marry, sir, I will stand to it, that a smith in his kind isa physician, a surgeon and a barber. For let a horse take a cold,or be troubled with the bots, and we straight give him a potion ora purgation, in such physical manner that he mends straight: if hehave outward diseases, as the spavin, splent, ringbone, windgall orfashion,[67] or, sir, a galled back, we let him blood and clap aplaster to him with a pestilence, that mends him with a very vengeance:now, if his mane grow out of order, and he have any rebellious hairs,we straight to our shears and trim him with what cut it please us, pickhis ears and make him neat. Marry, ay, indeed, sir, we are slovens forone thing; we never use musk-balls to wash him with, and the reason is,sir, because he can woo without kissing._First Ruf._ Well, sirrah, leave off these praises of a smith, andbring us to the best ale in the town._Adam._ Now, sir, I have a feat above all the smiths in Nineveh; for,sir, I am a philosopher that can dispute of the nature of ale; for markyou, sir, a pot of ale consists of four parts,--imprimus the ale, thetoast, the ginger, and the nutmeg._First Ruf._ Excellent!_Adam._ The ale is a restorative, bread is a binder: mark you, sir,two excellent points in physic; the ginger, O, ware of that! thephilosophers have written of the nature of ginger, 'tis expulsitive intwo degrees; you shall hear the sentence of Galen,    "It will make a man belch, cough, and fart,      And is a great comfort to the heart,"--a proper posy, I promise you; but now to the noble virtue of thenutmeg; it is, saith one ballad (I think an English Roman was theauthor), an underlayer to the brains, for when the ale gives a buffetto the head, O the nutmeg! that keeps him for a while in temper. Thusyou see the description of the virtue of a pot of ale; now, sir, toput my physical precepts in practice, follow me: but afore I step anyfurther--_First Ruf._ What's the matter now?_Adam._ Why, seeing I have provided the ale, who is the purveyor forthe wenches? for, masters, take this of me, a cup of ale without awench, why, alas, 'tis like an egg without salt, or a red-herringwithout mustard!_First Ruf._ Lead us to the ale; we'll have wenches enough, I warrantthee. [_Exeunt.__Oseas._ Iniquity seeks out companions still,    And mortal men are armèd to do ill.    London, look on, this matter nips thee near:    Leave off thy riot, pride, and sumptuous cheer;    Spend less at board, and spare not at the door,    But aid the infant, and relieve the poor;    Else seeking mercy, being merciless,    Thou be adjudg'd to endless heaviness.SCENE III.--_At the_ Usurer's. _Enter the_ Usurer, THRASYBULUS, _and_ ALCON.[68]_Usurer._ Come on, I am every day troubled with these needy companions:what news with you? what wind brings you hither?_Thras._ Sir, I hope, how far soever you make it off, you remember, toowell for me, that this is the day wherein I should pay you money that Itook up of you alate in a commodity.[69]_Alc._ And, sir, sir-reverence of your manhood and gentry, I havebrought home such money as you lent me._Usurer._ You, young gentleman, is my money ready?_Thras._ Truly, sir, this time was so short, the commodity so bad,and the promise of friends so broken, that I could not provide itagainst the day; wherefore I am come to entreat you to stand my friend,and to favour me with a longer time, and I will make you sufficientconsideration._Usurer._ Is the wind in that door? If thou hast thy money, so it is:I will not defer a day, an hour, a minute, but take the forfeit of thebond._Thras._ I pray you, sir, consider that my loss was great by thecommodity I took up: you know, sir, I borrowed of you forty pounds,whereof I had ten pounds in money, and thirty pounds in lute-strings,which when I came to sell again, I could get but five pounds for them,so had I, sir, but fifteen pounds for my forty. In consideration ofthis ill bargain, I pray you, sir, give me a month longer._Usurer._ I answered thee afore, not a minute; what have I to do howthy bargain proved? I have thy hand set to my book that thou receivedstforty pounds of me in money._Thras._ Ay, sir, it was your device that, to colour the statute, butyour conscience knows what I had._Alc._ Friend, thou speakest Hebrew to him when thou talkest to himof conscience; for he hath as much conscience about the forfeit of anobligation, as my blind mare, God bless her, hath over a manger of oats._Thras._ Then there is no favour, sir?_Usurer._ Come to-morrow to me, and see how I will use thee._Thras._ No, covetous caterpillar, know that I have made extreme shiftrather than I would fall into the hands of such a ravening panther;and therefore here is thy money, and deliver me the recognisance of mylands._Usurer_ [_aside_]. What a spite is this!--hath sped of his crowns! Ifhe had missed but one half hour, what a goodly farm had I gotten forforty pounds! Well, 'tis my cursed fortune. O, have I no shift to makehim forfeit his recognisance?_Thras._ Come, sir, will you despatch and tell your money? [_It strikesfour o'clock.__Usurer_ [_aside_]. Stay, what is this o'clock? four;--let me see--"tobe paid between the hours of three and four in the afternoon": thisgoes right for me.--You, sir, hear you not the clock, and have you nota counterpane[70] of your obligation? The hour is past, it was to bepaid between three and four; and now the clock hath strucken four: Iwill receive none, I'll stand to the forfeit of the recognisance._Thras._ Why, sir, I hope you do but jest; why, 'tis but four, and willyou for a minute take forfeit of my bond? If it were so, sir, I washere before four._Usurer._ Why didst thou not tender thy money then? if I offer theeinjury, take the law of me, complain to the judge: I will receive nomoney._Alc._ Well, sir, I hope you will stand my good master for my cow.I borrowed thirty shillings on her, and for that I have paid youeighteen-pence a week, and for her meat you have had her milk, and Itell you, sir, she gives a pretty sup: now, sir, here is your money._Usurer._ Hang, beggarly knave! comest to me for a cow? did I not bindher bought and sold for a penny, and was not thy day to have paidyesterday? Thou gettest no cow at my hand._Alc._ No cow, sir! alas, that word "no cow" goes as cold to my heartas a draught of small drink in a frosty morning! "No cow," sir! Why,alas, alas, Master Usurer, what shall become of me, my wife, and mypoor child?_Usurer._ Thou gettest no cow of me, knave! I cannot stand prating withyou; I must be gone._Ale._ Nay, but hear you, Master Usurer: "no cow!" Why, sir, here'syour thirty shillings: I have paid you eighteen-pence a week, andtherefore there is reason I should have my cow._Usurer._ What pratest thou? have I not answered thee, thy day isbroken?_Alc._ Why, sir, alas, my cow is a commonwealth to me! for first, sir,she allows me, my wife, and son, for to banquet ourselves withal,butter, cheese, whey, curds, cream, sod-milk, raw-milk, sour-milk,sweet-milk, and butter-milk: besides, sir, she saved me every year apenny in almanacs, for she was as good to me as a prognostication;if she had but set up her tail, and have gallop'd about the mead, mylittle boy was able to say, "O, father, there will be a storm"; hervery tail was a calendar to me: and now to lose my cow! alas, MasterUsurer, take pity upon me!_Usurer._ I have other matters to talk on; farewell, fellows._Thras._ Why, but, thou covetous churl, wilt thou not receive thymoney, and deliver me my recognisance?_Usurer._ I'll deliver thee none; if I have wronged thee, seek thymends at the law. [_Exit.__Thras._ And so I will, insatiable peasant._Alc._ And, sir, rather than I will put up this word "no cow," I willlay my wife's best gown to pawn. I tell you, sir, when the slaveuttered this word "no cow," it struck to my heart, for my wife shallnever have one so fit for her turn again; for, indeed, sir, she is awoman that hath her twiddling-strings broke._Thras._ What meanest thou by that, fellow?_Alc._ Marry, sir, sir-reverence of your manhood, she breaks windbehind; and indeed, sir, when she sat milking of her cow and let afart, my other cows would start at the noise, and kick down the milkand away; but this cow, sir, the gentlest cow! my wife might blowwhilst[71] she burst: and having such good conditions, shall the Usurercome upon me with "no cow"? Nay, sir, before I pocket up this word "nocow," my wife's gown goes to the lawyer: why, alas, sir, 'tis as ill aword to me as "no crown" to a king!_Thras._ Well, fellow, go with me, and I'll help thee to a lawyer._Alc._ Marry, and I will, sir. No cow! well, the world goes hard.[_Exeunt.__Oseas._ Where hateful usury    Is counted husbandry;    Where merciless men rob the poor,    And the needy are thrust out of door;    Where gain is held for conscience,    And men's pleasure is all on pence;    Where young gentlemen forfeit their lands,    Through riot, into the usurer's hands;    Where poverty is despis'd, and pity banish'd,    And mercy indeed utterly vanish'd:    Where men esteem more of money than of God;    Let that land look to feel his wrathful rod:    For there is no sin more odious in his sight    Than where usury defrauds the poor of his right.    London, take heed, these sins abound in thee;    The poor complain, the widows wrongèd be;    The gentlemen by subtlety are spoil'd;    The ploughmen lose the crop for which they toil'd:    Sin reigns in thee, O London, every hour:    Repent, and tempt not thus the heavenly power.ACT THE SECONDSCENE I.--_The Palace of_ RASNI. _Enter_ REMILIA, _with_ ALVIDA _and a train of_ Ladies, _in all royalty._    _Remil._ Fair queens, yet handmaids unto Rasni's love,    Tell me, is not my state as glorious    As Juno's pomp, when tir'd with heaven's despoil,    Clad in her vestments spotted all with stars,    She cross'd the silver path unto her Jove?    Is not Remilia far more beauteous,    Rich'd with the pride of nature's excellence,    Than Venus in the brightest of her shine?    My hairs, surpass they not Apollo's locks?    Are not my tresses curlèd with such art    As love delights to hide him in their fair?    Doth not mine eye shine like the morning lamp    That tells Aurora when her love will come?    Have I not stol'n the beauty of the heavens,    And plac'd it on the feature of my face?    Can any goddess make compare with me,    Or match her with the fair Remilia?    _Alvi._ The beauties that proud Paris saw from Troy,    Mustering in Ida for the golden ball,    Were not so gorgeous as Remilia.    _Remil._ I have trick'd my trammels up with richest balm,    And made my perfumes of the purest myrrh:    The precious drugs that Ægypt's wealth affords,    The costly paintings fetch'd from curious Tyre,    Have mended in my face what nature miss'd.    Am I not the earth's wonder in my looks?    _Alvi._ The wonder of the earth, and pride of heaven.    _Remil._ Look, Alvida, a hair stands not amiss;    For women's locks are trammels of conceit,    Which do entangle Love for all his wiles.    _Alvi._ Madam, unless you coy it trick and trim,    And play the civil[72] wanton ere you yield,    Smiting disdain of pleasures with your tongue,    Patting your princely Rasni on the cheek    When he presumes to kiss without consent,    You mar the market: beauty naught avails:    You must be proud; for pleasures hardly got    Are sweet if once attain'd.    _Remil._ Fair Alvida,    Thy counsel makes Remilia passing wise.    Suppose that thou wert Rasni's mightiness,    And I Remilia, prince of excellence.    _Alvi._ I would be master then of love and thee.    _Remil._ "Of love and me! Proud and disdainful king,    Dar'st thou presume to touch a deity,    Before she grace thee with a yielding smile?"[73]    _Alvi._ "Tut, my Remilia, be not thou so coy;    Say nay, and take it."[74]    _Remil._ "Careless and unkind!    Talks Rasni to Remilia in such sort    As if I did enjoy a human form?    Look on thy love, behold mine eyes divine,    And dar'st thou twit me with a woman's fault?    Ah Rasni, thou art rash to judge of me.    I tell thee, Flora oft hath woo'd my lips,    To lend a rose to beautify her spring;    The sea-nymphs fetch their lilies from my cheeks:    Then thou unkind!"--and hereon would I weep.    _Alvi._ And here would Alvida resign her charge;    For were I but in thought th' Assyrian king,    I needs must 'quite thy tears with kisses sweet,    And crave a pardon with a friendly touch:    You know it, madam, though I teach it not,    The touch I mean, you smile whenas you think it.    _Remil._ How am I pleas'd to hear thy pretty prate,    According to the humour of my mind!    Ah, nymphs, who fairer than Remilia?    The gentle winds have woo'd me with their sighs,    The frowning air hath clear'd when I did smile;    And when I trac'd upon the tender grass,    Love, that makes warm the centre of the earth,    Lift up his crest to kiss Remilia's foot;    Juno still entertains her amorous Jove    With new delights, for fear he look on me;    The phœnix' feathers are become my fan,    For I am beauty's phœnix in this world.    Shut close these curtains straight, and shadow me,    For fear Apollo spy me in his walks,    And scorn all eyes, to see Remilia's eyes.    Nymphs, eunuchs, sing, for Mavors draweth nigh:    Hide me in closure, let him long to look:    For were a goddess fairer than am I,    I'll scale the heavens to pull her from the place.    [_They draw the curtains, and music plays._    _Alvi._ Believe me, though she say that she is fairest,    I think my penny silver by her leave. _Enter_ RASNI _and_ RADAGON, _with_ Lords _in pomp, who make a ward about_ RASNI; _with them the_ Magi _in great pomp._    _Rasni._ Magi, for love of Rasni, by your art,    By magic frame an arbour out of hand,    For fair Remilia to disport her in.    Meanwhile, I will bethink me on further pomp. [_Exit._ [_The_ Magi _with their rods beat the ground, and from under the same rises a brave arbour;_[75] RASNI _returns in another suit, while the trumpets sound._    _Rasni._ Blest be ye, men of art, that grace me thus,    And blessèd be this day where Hymen hies    To join in union pride of heaven and earth!    [_Lightning and thunder, wherewith_ REMILIA _is strucken._    What wondrous threatening noise is this I hear?    What flashing lightnings trouble our delights?    When I draw near Remilia's royal tent,    I waking dream of sorrow and mishap.    _Radag._ Dread not, O king, at ordinary chance;    These are but common exhalations,    Drawn from the earth, in substance hot and dry,    Or moist and thick, or meteors combust,    Matters and causes incident to time,    Enkindled in the fiery region first.    Tut, be not now a Roman augurer:    Approach the tent, look on Remilia.    _Rasni._ Thou hast confirm'd my doubts, kind Radagon.--    Now ope, ye folds, where queen of favour sits,    Carrying a net within her curlèd locks,    Wherein the Graces are entangled oft;    Ope like th' imperial gates where Phœbus sits,    Whenas he means to woo his Clytia.    Nocturnal cares, ye blemishers of bliss,    Cloud not mine eyes whilst I behold her face.--    Remilia, my delight!--she answereth not.    [_He draws the curtains, and finds her strucken black with thunder._    How pale! as if bereav'd in fatal meads,    The balmy breath hath left her bosom quite:    My Hesperus by cloudy death is blent.[76]--    Villains, away, fetch syrups of the Inde,    Fetch balsomo, the kind preserve of life,    Fetch wine of Greece, fetch oils, fetch herbs, fetch all,    To fetch her life, or I will faint and die.    [_They bring in all these, and offer; naught prevails._    Herbs, oils of Inde, alas, there naught prevails!    Shut are the day-bright eyes that made me see;    Lock'd are the gems of joy in dens of death.    Yet triumph I on fate, and he on her:    Malicious mistress of inconstancy,    Damn'd be thy name, that hast obscur'd my joy.--    Kings, viceroys, princes, rear a royal tomb    For my Remilia; bear her from my sight,    Whilst I in tears weep for Remilia.    [_They bear_ REMILIA'S _body out._    _Radag._ What maketh Rasni moody? loss of one?    As if no more were left so fair as she.    Behold a dainty minion for the nonce,--    Fair Alvida, the Paphlagonian queen:    Woo her, and leave this weeping for the dead.    _Rasni._ What, woo my subject's wife that honoureth me!    _Radag._ Tut, kings this _meum, tuum_ should not know:    Is she not fair? is not her husband hence?    Hold, take her at the hands of Radagon;    A pretty peat[77] to drive your mourn away.    _Rasni._ She smiles on me, I see she is mine own.--    Wilt thou be Rasni's royal paramour?    _Radag._ She blushing yields consent.--Make no dispute:    The king is sad, and must be gladded straight;    Let Paphlagonian king go mourn meanwhile.    [_Thrusts_ RASNI _and_ ALVIDA _out; and so they    all exeunt._]    _Oseas._ Pride hath his judgment: London, look about;    'Tis not enough in show to be devout.    A fury now from heaven to lands unknown    Hath made the prophet speak, not to his own.    Fly, wantons, fly this pride and vain attire,    The seals to set your tender hearts on fire.    Be faithful in the promise you have past,    Else God will plague and punish at the last.    When lust is hid in shroud of wretched life,    When craft doth dwell in bed of married wife,    Mark but the prophet's word that shortly shows.[78]    After death expect for many woes.SCENE II.--_A Court of Justice in Nineveh._ _Enter_ ALCON _and_ THRASYBULUS, _with their_ Lawyer._Thras._ I need not, sir, discourse unto you the duty of lawyers intendering the right cause of their clients, nor the conscience you aretied unto by higher command. Therefore suffice, the Usurer hath done mewrong; you know the case; and, good sir, I have strained myself to giveyou your fees._Lawyer._ Sir, if I should any way neglect so manifest a truth, I wereto be accused of open perjury, for the case is evident._Alc._ And truly, sir, for my case, if you help me not for my matter,why, sir, I and my wife are quite undone; I want my mease[79] of milkwhen I go to my work, and my boy his bread and butter when he goes toschool. Master Lawyer, pity me, for surely, sir, I was fain to lay mywife's best gown to pawn for your fees: when I looked upon it, sir, andsaw how handsomely it was daubed with statute-lace,[80] and what a fairmockado[81] cape it had, and then thought how handsomely it became mywife,--truly, sir, my heart is made of butter, it melts at the leastpersecution,--I fell on weeping; but when I thought on the words theUsurer gave me, "no cow," then, sir, I would have stript her into hersmock, but I would make him deliver my cow ere I had done: therefore,good Master Lawyer, stand my friend._Lawyer._ Trust me, father, I will do for thee as much as for myself._Alc._ Are you married, sir?_Lawyer._ Ay, marry, am I, father._Alc._ Then good's benison light on you and your good wife, and sendher that she be never troubled with my wife's disease._Lawyer._ Why, what's thy wife's disease._Alc._ Truly, sir, she hath two open faults, and one privy fault. Sir,the first is, she is too eloquent for a poor man, and hath the words ofart, for she will call me rascal, rogue, runagate, varlet, vagabond,slave, knave: why, alas, sir, and these be but holiday-terms, but ifyou heard her working-day words, in faith, sir, they be rattlers likethunder, sir; for after the dew follows a storm, for then am I sureeither to be well buffeted, my face scratched, or my head broken: andtherefore, good Master Lawyer, on my knees I ask it, let me not go homeagain to my wife with this word "no cow"; for then she will exerciseher two faults upon me with all extremity._Lawyer._ Fear not, man. But what is thy wife's privy fault?_Alc._ Truly, sir, that's a thing of nothing; alas, she, indeed,sir-reverence of your mastership, doth use to break wind in hersleep.--O, sir, here comes the Judge, and the old caitiff the Usurer. _Enter the_ Judge, _attended, and the_ Usurer._Usurer._ Sir, here is forty angels for you, and if at any time youwant a hundred pound or two, 'tis ready at your command, or the feedingof three or four fat bullocks: whereas these needy slaves can rewardwith nothing but a cap and a knee; and therefore I pray you, sir,favour my case._Judge._ Fear not, sir, I'll do what I can for you._Usurer._ What, Master Lawyer, what make you here? mine adversary forthese clients?_Lawyer._ So it chanceth now, sir._Usurer._ I know you know the old proverb, "He is not wise that is notwise for himself": I would not be disgraced in this action; thereforehere is twenty angels; say nothing in the matter, or what you say, sayto no purpose, for the Judge is my friend._Lawyer._ Let me alone, I'll fit your purpose._Judge._ Come, where are these fellows that are the plaintiffs? whatcan they say against this honest citizen our neighbour, a man of goodreport amongst all men?_Alc._ Truly, Master Judge, he is a man much spoken of; marry, everyman's cries are against him, and especially we; and therefore I thinkwe have brought our Lawyer to touch him with as much law as will fetchhis lands and my cow with a pestilence._Thras._ Sir, I am the other plaintiff, and this is my counsellor: Ibeseech your honour be favourable to me in equity._Judge._ O, Signor Mizaldo, what can you say in this gentleman's behalf?_Lawyer._ Faith, sir, as yet little good.--Sir, tell you your own caseto the Judge, for I have so many matters in my head, that I have almostforgotten it._Thras._ Is the wind in that door? Why then, my lord, thus. I tookup of this cursed Usurer, for so I may well term him, a commodity offorty pounds, whereof I received ten pound in money, and thirty poundin lute-strings, whereof I could by great friendship make but fivepounds: for the assurance of this bad commodity I bound him my landin recognisance: I came at my day, and tendered him his money, and hewould not take it: for the redress of my open wrong I crave but justice._Judge._ What say you to this, sir?_Usurer._ That first he had no lute-strings of me; for, look you, sir,I have his own hand to my book for the receipt of forty pound._Thras._ That was, sir, but a device of him to colour the statute._Judge._ Well, he hath thine own hand, and we can crave no more inlaw.--But now, sir, he says his money was tendered at the day and hour._Usurer._ This is manifest contrary, sir, and on that I will depose;for here is the obligation, "to be paid between three and four in theafternoon," and the clock struck four before he offered it, and thewords be "between three and four," therefore to be tendered before four._Thras._ Sir, I was there before four, and he held me withbrabbling[82] till the clock struck, and then for the breach of aminute he refused my money, and kept the recognisance of my land for sosmall a trifle.--Good Signor Mizaldo, speak what is law; you have yourfee, you have heard what the case is, and therefore do me justice andright: I am a young gentleman, and speak for my patrimony._Lawyer._ Faith, sir, the case is altered; you told me it before inanother manner: the law goes quite against you, and therefore you mustplead to the Judge for favour._Thras._ [_Aside_]. O execrable bribery!_Alc._ Faith, Sir Judge, I pray you let me be the gentleman'scounsellor, for I can say thus much in his defence, that the Usurer'sclock is the swiftest clock in all the town: 'tis, sir, like a woman'stongue, it goes ever half-an-hour before the time; for when we weregone from him, other clocks in the town struck four._Judge._ Hold thy prating, fellow:--and you, young gentleman, this ismy ward: look better another time both to your bargains and to thepayments; for I must give flat sentence against you, that, for defaultof tendering the money between the hours, you have forfeited yourrecognisance, and he to have the land._Thras._ [_Aside_]. O inspeakable injustice!_Alc._ [_Aside_]. O monstrous, miserable, moth-eaten Judge!_Judge._ Now you, fellow, what have you to say for your matter?_Alc._ Master Lawyer, I laid my wife's gown to pawn for your fees: Ipray you, to this gear.[83]_Lawyer._ Alas, poor man, thy matter is out of my head, and therefore,I pray thee, tell it thyself._Alc._ I hold my cap to a noble,[84] that the Usurer hath given himsome gold, and he, chewing it in his mouth, hath got the toothache thathe cannot speak._Judge._ Well, sirrah, I must be short, and therefore say on._Alc._ Master Judge, I borrowed of this man thirty shillings, forwhich I left him in pawn my good cow; the bargain was, he should haveeighteen-pence a week, and the cow's milk for usury: now, sir, as soonas I had gotten the money, I brought it him, and broke but a day, andfor that he refused his money, and keeps my cow, sir._Judge._ Why, thou hast given sentence against thyself, for in breakingthy day thou hast lost thy cow._Alc._ Master Lawyer, now for my ten shillings._Lawyer._ Faith, poor man, thy case is so bad, I shall but speakagainst thee._Alc._ 'Twere good, then, I should have my ten shillings again._Lawyer._ 'Tis my fee, fellow, for coming: wouldst thou have me comefor nothing?_Alc._ Why, then, am I like to go home, not only with no cow, but nogown: this gear goes hard._Judge._ Well, you have heard what favour I can show you: I must dojustice.--Come, Master Mizaldo,--and you, sir, go home with me todinner._Alc._ Why, but, Master Judge, no cow!--and, Master Lawyer, no gown!Then must I clean run out of the town.[_Exeunt_ Judge, Lawyer, Usurer, _and_ Attendants.How cheer you, gentleman? you cry "no lands" too; the Judge hath madeyou a knight for a gentleman, hath dubbed you Sir John Lack-land._Thras._ O miserable time, wherein gold is above God!_Alc._ Fear not, man; I have yet a fetch to get thy lands and my cowagain, for I have a son in the court, that is either a king or a king'sfellow, and to him will I go and complain on the Judge and the Usurerboth._Thras._ And I will go with thee, and entreat him for my case._Alc._ But how shall I go home to my wife, when I shall have nothing tosay unto her but "no cow"? alas, sir, my wife's faults will fall uponme!_Thras._ Fear not; let's go; I'll quiet her, shalt see. [_Exeunt.__Oseas._ Fly, judges, fly corruption in your court;    The judge of truth hath made your judgment short.    Look so to judge that at the latter day    Ye be not judg'd with those that wend astray.    Who passeth judgment for his private gain,    He well may judge he is adjudg'd to pain.SCENE III.--_A Street near the_ King's _Palace._ _Enter_ ADAM _and his crew of_ Ruffians _drunk.__Adam._ Farewell, gentle tapster.--Masters, as good ale as ever wastapt; look to your feet, for the ale is strong.--Well, farewell, gentletapster._First Ruf._ [_to Second Ruf._] Why, sirrah slave, by heaven's maker,thinkest thou the wench loves thee best because she laughed on thee?give me but such another word, and I will throw the pot at thy head._Adam._ Spill no drink, spill no drink, the ale is good: I'll tellyou what, ale is ale, and so I'll commend me to you with heartycommendations.--Farewell, gentle tapster._Second Ruf._ Why, wherefore, peasant, scornest thou that the wenchshould love me? look but on her, and I'll thrust my dagger in thy bosom._First Ruf._ Well, sirrah, well, tha'rt as tha'rt, and so I'll takethee._Second Ruf._ Why, what am I?_First Ruf._ Why, what thou wilt; a slave._Second Ruf._ Then take that, villain, and learn how thou use meanother time. [_Stabs_ First Ruf._First Ruf._ O, I am slain! [_Dies.__Second Ruf._ That's all one to me, I care not. Now will I in to mywench, and call for a fresh pot. [_Exit: followed by all except_ ADAM._Adam._ Nay, but hear ye, take me with ye, for the ale is ale.--Cut afresh toast, tapster, fill me a pot; here is money, I am no beggar,I'll follow thee as long as the ale lasts.--A pestilence on the blocksfor me, for I might have had a fall: well, if we shall have no ale,I'll sit me down: and so farewell, gentle tapster. [_Here he falls overthe dead man._ _Enter_ RASNI, ALVIDA, _the_ KING OF CILICIA, Lords, _and_ Attendants._Rasni._ What slaughter'd wretch lies bleeding here his last,    So near the royal palace of the king?    Search out if any one be biding nigh,    That can discourse the manner of his death.--    Seat thee, fair Alvida, the fair of fairs;    Let not the object once offend thine eyes._First Lord._ Here's one sits here asleep, my lord._Rasni._ Wake him, and make inquiry of this thing._First Lord._ Sirrah, you! hearest thou, fellow?_Adam._ If you will fill a fresh pot, here's a penny, or else farewell,gentle tapster._First Lord._ He is drunk, my lord._Rasni._ We'll sport with him, that Alvida may laugh._First Lord._ Sirrah, thou fellow, thou must come to the king._Adam._ I will not do a stroke of work to-day, for the ale is good ale,and you can ask but a penny for a pot, no more by the statute._First Lord._ Villain, here's the king; thou must come to him._Adam._ The king come to an ale-house!--Tapster, fill me threepots.--Where's the king? is this he?--Give me your hand, sir: as goodale as ever was tapt; you shall drink while your skin crack._Rasni._ But hearest thou, fellow, who killed this man?_Adam._ I'll tell you, sir,--if you did taste of the ale,--all Ninevehhath not such a cup of ale, it flowers in the cup, sir; by my troth, Ispent eleven pence, beside three races of ginger--_Rasni._ Answer me, knave, to my question, how came this man slain?_Adam._ Slain! why [the] ale is strong ale, 'tis huffcap;[85] I warrantyou, 'twill make a man well.--Tapster, ho! for the king a cup of aleand a fresh toast; here's two races more._Alvi._ Why, good fellow, the king talks not of drink; he would havethee tell him how this man came dead._Adam._ Dead! nay, I think I am alive yet, and will drink a full potere night: but hear ye, if ye be the wench that filled us drink, why,so, do your office, and give us a fresh pot; or if you be the tapster'swife, why, so, wash the glass clean._Alvi._ He is so drunk, my lord, there is no talking with him._Adam._ Drunk! nay, then, wench, I am not drunk: th'art shitten queanto call me drunk; I tell thee I am not drunk, I am a smith, I. _Enter the_ Smith._First Lord._ Sir, here comes one perhaps that can tell._Smith._ God save you, master._Rasni._ Smith, canst thou tell me how this man came dead?_Smith._ May it please your highness, my man here and a crew of themwent to the ale-house, and came out so drunk that one of them killedanother; and now, sir, I am fain to leave my shop, and come to fetchhim home._Rasni._ Some of you carry away the dead body: drunken men must havetheir fits; and, sirrah smith, hence with thy man._Smith._ Sirrah, you, rise, come go with me._Adam._ If we shall have a pot of ale, let's have it; here's money;hold, tapster, take my purse._Smith._ Come, then, with me, the pot stands full in the house._Adam._ I am for you, let's go, th'art an honest tapster: we'll drinksix pots ere we part.

I see, yea, sighing see,    How Israel sins, yet knows the way of truth,    And thereby grows the bye-word of the world.    How, then, should God in judgment be so strict    'Gainst those who never heard or knew his power.    To threaten utter ruin of them all?    Should I report this judgment of my God,    I should incite them more to follow sin,    And publish to the world my country's blame.    It may not be, my conscience tells me--no.    Ah, Jonas, wilt thou prove rebellious then?    Consider, ere thou fall, what error is.    My mind misgives: to Joppa will I fly,    And for a while to Tharsus shape my course,    Until the Lord unfret his angry brows. _Enter certain_ Merchants _of_ Tharsus, _a_ Master, _and some_ Sailors.    _Master._ Come on, brave merchants; now the wind doth serve,    And sweetly blows a gale at west-south-west,    Our yards across; our anchor's on the pike;    What, shall we hence, and take this merry gale?    _First Mer._ Sailors, convey our budgets straight aboard,    And we will recompense your pains at last:    If once in safety we may Tharsus see,    Master, we'll feast these merry mates and thee.    _Master._ Meanwhile content yourselves with silly cates;    Our beds are boards, our feasts are full of mirth:    We use no pomp, we are the lords of sea;    When princes sweat in care, we swink[88] of glee.    Orion's shoulders and the Pointers serve    To be our loadstars in the lingering night;    The beauties of Arcturus we behold;    And though the sailor is no bookman held,    He knows more art than ever bookmen read.    _First Sai._ By heavens, well said in honour of our trade!    Let's see the proudest scholar steer his course,    Or shift his tides, as silly sailors do;    Then will we yield them praise, else never none.    _First Mer._ Well spoken, fellow, in thine own behalf.    But let us hence: wind tarries none, you wot,    And tide and time let slip is hardly got.    _Master._ March to the haven, merchants; I follow you.    [_Exeunt_ Merchants.    _Jonas_ [_aside_].

Hold, take thine hire; I follow thee, my friend.    _Master._ Where is your budget? let me bear it, sir.    _Jonas._ Go on in peace; who sail as I do now[92]    Put trust in him who succoureth every want.    [_Exeunt._    _Oseas._ When prophets, new-inspir'd, presume to force    And tie the power of heaven to their conceits;    When fear, promotion, pride, or simony,    Ambition, subtle craft, their thoughts disguise,    Woe to the flock whereas the shepherd's foul!    For, lo, the Lord at unawares shall plague    The careless guide, because his flocks do stray.    The axe already to the tree is set:    Beware to tempt the Lord, ye men of art.SCENE II.--_A Public Place in Nineveh._ _Enter_ ALCON, THRASYBULUS, SAMIA, _and_ CLESIPHON.    _Cles._ Mother, some meat, or else I die for want.    _Samia._ Ah little boy, how glad thy mother would    Supply thy wants, but naked need denies!    Thy father's slender portion in this world    By usury and false deceit is lost:    No charity within this city bides;    All for themselves, and none to help the poor.    _Cles._ Father, shall Clesiphon have no relief?_Alc._ Faith, my boy, I must be flat with thee, we must feed uponproverbs now; as "Necessity hath no law," "A churl's feast is betterthan none at all;" for other remedies have we none, except thy brotherRadagon help us.    _Samia._ Is this thy slender care to help our child?    Hath nature arm'd thee to no more remorse?[93]    Ah, cruel man, unkind and pitiless!--    Come, Clesiphon, my boy, I'll beg for thee.    _Cles._ O, how my mother's mourning moveth me!_Alc._ Nay, you shall pay me interest for getting the boy, wife, beforeyou carry him hence: alas, woman, what can Alcon do more? I'll pluckthe belly out of my heart for thee, sweet Samia; be not so waspish.    _Samia._ Ah silly man, I know thy want is great,    And foolish I to crave where nothing is.    Haste, Alcon, haste, make haste unto our son;    Who, since he is in favour of the king,    May help this hapless gentleman and us    For to regain our goods from tyrant's hands.    _Thras._ Have patience, Samia, wait your weal from heaven:    The gods have rais'd your son, I hope, for this,    To succour innocents in their distress.    Lo, where he comes from the imperial court;    Go, let us prostrate us before his feet._Alc._ Nay, by my troth, I'll never ask my son's blessing; che trow,cha[94] taught him his lesson to know his father. _Enter_ RADAGON _attended._[95]What, son Radagon! i'faith, boy, how dost thee?_Radag._ Villain, disturb me not; I cannot stay._Alc._ Tut, son, I'll help you of that disease quickly, for I can holdthee: ask thy mother, knave, what cunning I have to ease a woman whena qualm of kindness comes too near her stomach; let me but clasp minearms about her body, and say my prayers in her bosom, and she shall behealed presently.    _Radag._ Traitor unto my princely majesty,    How dar'st thou lay thy hands upon a king?    _Samia._ No traitor, Radagon, but true is he:    What, hath promotion blearèd thus thine eye,    To scorn thy father when he visits thee?    Alas, my son, behold with ruthful eyes    Thy parents robb'd of all their worldly weal    By subtle means of usury and guile:    The judge's ears are deaf and shut up close;    All mercy sleeps: then be thou in these plunges[96]    A patron to thy mother in her pains:    Behold thy brother almost dead for food:    O, succour us, that first did succour thee!    _Radag._ What, succour me! false callet,[97] hence, avaunt!    Old dotard, pack! move not my patience:    I know you not; kings never look so low.    _Samia._ You know us not! O Radagon, you know    That, knowing us, you know your parents then;    Thou know'st this womb first brought thee forth to light:    I know these paps did foster thee, my son._Alc._ And I know he hath had many a piece of bread and cheese at myhands, as proud as he is; that know I.    _Thras._ I wait no hope of succour in this place,    Where children hold their fathers in disgrace.    _Radag._ Dare you enforce the furrows of revenge    Within the brows of royal Radagon?    Villain, avaunt! hence, beggars, with your brats!--    Marshal, why whip you not these rogues away,    That thus disturb our royal majesty?    _Cles._ Mother, I see it is a wondrous thing,    From base estate for to become a king;    For why, methink, my brother in these fits    Hath got a kingdom, and hath lost his wits.    _Radag._ Yet more contempt before my royalty?    Slaves, fetch out tortures worse than Tityus' plagues,    And tear their tongues from their blasphémous heads.    _Thras._ I'll get me gone, though wo-begone with grief:    No hope remains:--come, Alcon, let us wend._Radag._ 'Twere best you did, for fear you catch your bane.[_Exit_ THRASYBULUS.    _Samia._ Nay, traitor, I will haunt thee to the death:    Ungracious son, untoward, and perverse,    I'll fill the heavens with echoes of thy pride,    And ring in every ear thy small regard,    That dost despise thy parents in their wants;    And breathing forth my soul before thy feet,    My curses still shall haunt thy hateful head,    And being dead, my ghost shall thee pursue. _Enter_ RASNI, _attended on by his_ Magi _and_ Kings.    _Rasni._ How now! what mean these outcries in our court,    Where naught should sound but harmonies of heaven?    What maketh Radagon so passionate?    _Samia._ Justice, O king, justice against my son!    _Rasni._ Thy son! what son?    _Samia._ This cursèd Radagon.    _Radag._ Dread monarch, this is but a lunacy,    Which grief and want hath brought the woman to.--    What, doth this passion hold you every moon?    _Samia._ O, politic in sin and wickedness,    Too impudent for to delude thy prince!--    O Rasni, this same womb first brought him forth:    This is his father, worn with care and age,    This is his brother, poor unhappy lad,    And I his mother, though contemn'd by him.    With tedious toil we got our little good,    And brought him up to school with mickle charge:    Lord, how we joy'd to see his towardness!    And to ourselves we oft in silence said,    This youth when we are old may succour us.    But now preferr'd, and lifted up by thee,    We quite destroy'd by cursèd usury,    He scorneth me, his father, and this child.    _Cles._ He plays the serpent right, describ'd in Æsop's tale,    That sought the foster's death, that lately gave him life._Alc._ Nay, an please your majesty-ship, for proof he was my child,search the parish-book: the clerk will swear it, his godfathers andgodmothers can witness it: it cost me forty pence in ale and cakes onthe wives at his christening.--Hence, proud king! thou shalt never morehave my blessing!    _Rasni_ [_taking_ RADAGON _apart_].    Say sooth in secret, Radagon,    Is this thy father?    _Radag._ Mighty king, he is;    I blushing tell it to your majesty.    _Rasni._ Why dost thou, then, contemn him and his friends?    _Radag._ Because he is a base and abject swain,    My mother and her brat both beggarly,    Unmeet to be allied unto a king.    Should I, that look on Rasni's countenance,    And march amidst his royal equipage,    Embase myself to speak to such as they?    'Twere impious so to impair the love    That mighty Rasni bears to Radagon.    I would your grace would quit them from your sight,    That dare presume to look on Jove's compare.    _Rasni._ I like thy pride, I praise thy policy;    Such should they be that wait upon my court:    Let me alone to answer, Radagon.--    Villains, seditious traitors, as you be,    That scandalise the honour of a king,    Depart my court, you stales of impudence,    Unless you would be parted from your limbs!    Too base for to entitle fatherhood    To Rasni's friend, to Rasni's favourite.    _Radag._ Hence, begging scold! hence, caitiff clogg'd with years!    On pain of death, revisit not the court.    Was I conceiv'd by such a scurvy trull,    Or brought to light by such a lump of dirt?    Go, losel, trot it to the cart and spade!    Thou art unmeet to look upon a king.    Much less to be the father of a king._Alc._ You may see, wife, what a goodly piece of work you have made:have I taught you arsmetry, as _additiori multiplicarum_, the rule ofthree, and all for the begetting of a boy, and to be banished for mylabour?

[_Exeunt._    _Oseas._ When disobedience reigneth in the child,    And princes' ears by flattery be beguil'd;    When laws do pass by favour, not by truth;    When falsehood swarmeth both in old and youth;    When gold is made a god to wrong the poor,    And charity exil'd from rich men's door;    When men by wit do labour to disprove    The plagues for sin sent down by God above;    When great men's ears are stopt to good advice,    And apt to hear those tales that feed their vice;    Woe to the land! for from the East shall rise    A Lamb of peace, the scourge of vanities,    The judge of truth, the patron of the just,    Who soon will lay presumption in the dust,    And give the humble poor their hearts' desire,    And doom the worldlings to eternal fire:    Repent, all you that hear, for fear of plagues.    O London, this and more doth swarm in thee!    Repent, repent, for why the Lord doth see:    With trembling pray, and mend what is amiss;    The sword of justice drawn already is.SCENE III.--_Within the_ Smith's _House._ _Enter_ ADAM _and the_ Smith's Wife._Adam._ Why, but hear you, mistress: you know a woman's eyes are like apair of pattens, fit to save shoe-leather in summer, and to keep awaythe cold in winter; so you may like your husband with the one eye,because you are married, and me with the other, because I am your man.Alas, alas! think, mistress, what a thing love is: why, it is like toan ostry-faggot,[99] that, once set on fire, is as hardly quenched asthe bird[100] crocodile driven out of her nest._S. Wife._ Why, Adam, cannot a woman wink but she must sleep? and canshe not love but she must cry it out at the cross? Know, Adam, I lovethee as myself, now that we are together in secret._Adam._ Mistress, these words of yours are like to a fox-tail placedin a gentlewoman's fan, which, as it is light, so it giveth life: O,these words are as sweet as a lily! whereupon, offering a borachio[101]of kisses to your unseemly personage, I entertain you upon furtheracquaintance._S. Wife._ Alas, my husband comes!    _Adam._ Strike up the drum    And say no words but mum. _Enter the_ Smith._Smith._ Sirrah you, and you, huswife, well taken together! I have longsuspected you, and now I am glad I have found you together._Adam._ Truly, sir, and I am glad that I may do you any way pleasure,either in helping you or my mistress._Smith._ Boy here, and knave, you shall know it straight; I will haveyou both before the magistrate, and there have you surely punished._Adam._ Why, then, master, you are jealous?_Smith._ Jealous, knave! how can I be but jealous, to see you ever sofamiliar together? Thou art not only content to drink away my goods,but to abuse my wife._Adam._ Two good qualities, drunkenness and lechery: but, master, areyou jealous?_Smith._ Ay, knave, and thou shalt know it ere I pass, for I willbeswinge thee while this rope will hold._S. Wife._ My good husband, abuse him not, for he never proffered youany wrong._Smith._ Nay, whore, thy part shall not be behind._Adam._ Why, suppose, master, I have offended you, is it lawful for themaster to beat the servant for all offences?_Smith._ Ay, marry, is it, knave._Adam._ Then, master, will I prove by logic, that seeing all sins areto receive correction, the master is to be corrected of the man. And,sir, I pray you, what greater sin is than jealousy? 'tis like a mad dogthat for anger bites himself: therefore that I may do my duty to you,good master, and to make a white[102] son of you, I will so beswingejealousy out of you, as you shall love me the better while you live._Smith._ What, beat thy master, knave?_Adam._ What, beat thy man, knave? and, ay, master, and double beatyou, because you are a man of credit; and therefore have at you thefairest for forty pence. [_Beats the_ Smith._Smith._ Alas, wife, help, help! my man kills me._S. Wife._ Nay, even as you have baked, so brew: jealousy must bedriven out by extremities._Adam._ And that will I do, mistress._Smith._ Hold thy hand, Adam; and not only I forgive and forget all,but I will give thee a good farm to live on._Adam._ Begone, peasant, out of the compass of my further wrath, for Iam a corrector of vice; and at night I will bring home my mistress._Smith._ Even when you please, good Adam._Adam._ When I please,--mark the words--'tis a lease-parol,[103] tohave and to hold. Thou shalt be mine for ever: and so let's go to theale-house.

A sacrifice._    _Oseas._ If warnèd once, the ethnics thus repent,    And at the first their error do lament,    What senseless beasts, devourèd in their sin,    Are they whom long persuasions cannot win!    Beware, ye western cities,--where the word    Is daily preachèd, both at church and board,    Where majesty the gospel doth maintain,    Where preachers, for your good, themselves do pain,--    To dally long and still protract the time;    The Lord is just, and you but dust and slime:    Presume not far, delay not to amend;    Who suffereth long, will punish in the end.    Cast thy account, O London, in this case,    Then judge what cause thou hast to call for grace!SCENE II.--_The Seashore near Nineveh._ JONAS _is cast out of the Whale's belly upon the Stage._    _Jonas._ Lord of the light, thou maker of the world,    Behold, thy hands of mercy rear me up!    Lo, from the hideous bowels of this fish    Thou hast return'd me to the wishèd air!    Lo, here, apparent witness of thy power,    The proud leviathan that scours the seas,    And from his nostrils showers out stormy floods,    Whose back resists the tempest of the wind,    Whose presence makes the scaly troops to shake,    With humble stress of his broad-open'd chaps,    Hath lent me harbour in the raging floods!    Thus, though my sin hath drawn me down to death,    Thy mercy hath restorèd me to life.    Bow ye, my knees; and you, my bashful eyes,    Weep so for grief as you to water would.    In trouble, Lord, I callèd unto thee;    Out of the belly of the deepest hell    I cried, and thou didst hear my voice, O God!    'Tis thou hadst cast me down into the deep:    The seas and floods did compass me about;    I thought I had been cast from out thy sight;    The weeds were wrapt about my wretched head;    I went unto the bottom of the hills:    But thou, O Lord my God, hast brought me up!    On thee I thought whenas my soul did faint    My prayers did prease[107] before thy mercy-seat.    Then will I pay my vows unto the Lord,    For why salvation cometh from his throne.     _The_ Angel _appears._    _Angel._ Jonas, arise, get thee to Nineveh,    And preach to them the preachings that I bade;    Haste thee to see the will of heaven perform'd.    [_The_ Angel _departs._    _Jonas._ Jehovah, I am prest[108] to do thy will.--    What coast is this, and where am I arriv'd?    Behold sweet Lycus streaming in his bounds,    Bearing the walls of haughty Nineveh,    Whereas three hundred towers do tempt the heaven.    Fair are thy walls, pride of Assyria;    But, lo, thy sins have piercèd through the clouds!    Here will I enter boldly, since I know    My God commands, whose power no power resists.    [_Exit._    _Oseas._ You prophets, learn by Jonas how to live;    Repent your sins, whilst he doth warning give.    Who knows his master's will, and doth it not,    Shall suffer many stripes, full well I wot.SCENE III.--_The Garden of_ RASNI'S _Palace._ _Enter_ ALVIDA _in rich attire, with the_ KING OF CILICIA, _and her_ Ladies.    _Alvi._ Ladies, go sit you down amidst this bower,    And let the eunuchs play you all asleep:    Put garlands made of roses on your heads,    And play the wantons whilst I talk a while.    _First Lady._ Thou beautiful of all the world, we will.    [Ladies _enter the bower._    _Alvi._ King of Cilicia, kind and courteous,    Like to thyself, because a lovely king,    Come, lay thee down upon thy mistress' knee,    And I will sing and talk of love to thee.    _K. of Cil._ Most gracious paragon of excellence,    It fits not such an abject prince as I,    To talk with Rasni's paramour and love.    _Alvi._ To talk, sweet friend!

Wife._ O, but, Adam, I am afraid to walk so late, because of thespirits that appear in the city._Adam._ What, are you afraid of spirits? Armed as I am, with ale andnutmegs, turn me loose to all the devils in hell._S. Wife._ Alas, Adam, Adam! the devil, the devil!_Adam._ The devil, mistress! fly you for your safeguard; [_Exit_ S.Wife.] let me alone; the devil and I will deal well enough, if he haveany honesty at all in him: I'll either win him with a smooth tale, orelse with a toast and a cup of ale._Devil_ [_singing_].    _O, O, O, O, fain would I be,_    _If that my kingdom fulfill'd I might see!_    _O, O, O, O!__Adam._ Surely this is a merry devil, and I believe he is one ofLucifer's minstrels; hath a sweet voice; now surely, surely, he maysing to a pair of tongs and a bagpipe._Devil._ O, thou art he that I seek for._Adam.

Nominus patrus_!--I bless me from thee, and I conjure thee totell me who thou art!_Devil._ I am the spirit of the dead man that was slain in thy companywhen we were drunk together at the ale.[113]_Adam._ By my troth, sir, I cry you mercy; your face is so changed thatI had quite forgotten you: well, master devil, we have tossed over manya pot of ale together._Devil._ And therefore must thou go with me to hell._Adam_ [_aside_]. I have a policy to shift him, for I know he comes outof a hot place, and I know myself, the smith and the devil hath a drytooth in his head: therefore will I leave him asleep and run my way._Devil._ Come, art thou ready?_Adam._ Faith, sir, my old friend, and now goodman devil, you know youand I have been tossing many a good cup of ale: your nose is grown veryrich: what say you, will you take a pot of ale now at my hands? Hell islike a smith's forge, full of water, and yet ever athirst._Devil._ No ale, villain; spirits cannot drink; come, get upon my back,that I may carry thee.[114]_Adam._ You know I am a smith, sir: let me look whether you be wellshod or no; for if you want a shoe, a remove, or the clinching of anail, I am at your command._Devil._ Thou hast never a shoe fit for me._Adam,_ Why, sir, we shoe horned beasts, as well as you,--[_Aside._]O good Lord! let me sit down and laugh; hath never a cloven foot; adevil, quoth he! I'll use _Spritus santus_ nor _Nominus patrus_ no moreto him, I warrant you; I'll do more good upon him with my cudgel: nowwill I sit me down, and become justice of peace to the devil._Devil._ Come, art thou ready?_Adam._ I am ready, and with this cudgel I will conjure thee. [_Beatshim.__Devil._ O, hold thy hand! thou killest me, thou killest me! [_Exit.__Adam._ Then may I count myself, I think, a tall[115] man, that am ableto kill a devil. Now who dare deal with me in the parish? or what wenchin Nineveh will not love me, when they say, "There goes he that beatthe devil?"

Jack skinker, fill it full,    A pledge unto the health of heavenly Alvida.    _Rasni._ Vassals, attendant on our royal feasts,    Drink you, I say, unto my lover's health:    Let none that is in Rasni's royal court    Go this night safe and sober to his bed. _Enter_ ADAM._Adam._ This way he is, and here will I speak with him._First Lord._ Fellow, whither pressest thou?_Adam._ I press nobody, sir; I am going to speak with a friend of mine._First Lord._ Why, slave, here is none but the king, and his viceroys._Adam._ The king! marry, sir, he is the man I would speak withal._First Lord._ Why, callest him a friend of thine?_Adam._ Ay, marry, do I, sir; for if he be not my friend, I'll make himmy friend, ere he and I pass._First Lord._ Away, vassal, begone! thou speak unto the king!_Adam._ Ay, marry, will I, sir; an if he were a king of velvet, I willtalk to him._Rasni._ What's the matter there? what noise is that?_Adam._ A boon, my liege, a boon, my liege!    _Rasni._ What is it that great Rasni will not grant,    This day, unto the meanest of his land,    In honour of his beauteous Alvida?    Come hither, swain; what is it that thou cravest?_Adam._ Faith, sir, nothing, but to speak a few sentences to yourworship._Rasni._ Say, what is it?_Adam._ I am sure, sir, you have heard of the spirits that walk in thecity here._Rasni._ Ay, what of that?_Adam._ Truly, sir, I have an oration to tell you of one of them; andthis it is._Alvi._ Why goest not forward with thy tale?_Adam._ Faith, mistress, I feel an imperfection in my voice, a diseasethat often troubles me; but, alas, easily mended; a cup of ale or a cupof wine will serve the turn._Alvi._ Fill him a bowl, and let him want no drink._Adam._ O, what a precious word was that, "And let him want no drink!"[_Drink given to_ ADAM.] Well, sir, now I'll tell you forth my tale.Sir, as I was coming alongst the port-royal of Nineveh, there appearedto me a great devil, and as hard-favoured a devil as ever I saw; nay,sir, he was a cuckoldly devil, for he had horns on his head. Thisdevil, mark you now, presseth upon me, and, sir, indeed, I charged himwith my pike-staff; but when that would not serve, I came upon him with_Spritus santus_,--why, it had been able to have put Lucifer out of hiswits: when I saw my charm would not serve, I was in such a perplexity,that sixpenny-worth of juniper would not have made the place sweetagain._Alvi._ Why, fellow, wert thou so afraid?_Adam._ O, mistress, had you been there and seen, his very sight hadmade you shift a clean smock! I promise you, though I were a man, andcounted a tall fellow, yet my laundress called me slovenly knave thenext day._Rasni._ A pleasant slave.--Forward, sirrah, on with thy tale._Adam._ Faith, sir, but I remember a word that my mistress yourbed-fellow spoke._Rasni._ What was that, fellow?_Adam._ O, sir, a word of comfort, a precious word--"And let him wantno drink."_Rasni._ Her word is law; and thou shalt want no drink. [_Drink givento_ ADAM._Adam._ Then, sir, this devil came upon me, and would not be persuaded,but he would needs carry me to hell. I proffered him a cup of ale,thinking, because he came out of so hot a place, that he was thirsty;but the devil was not dry, and therefore the more sorry was I. Well,there was no remedy but I must with him to hell: and at last I castmine eye aside; if you knew what I spied you would laugh, sir; I lookedfrom top to toe, and he had no cloven feet. Then I ruffled up my hair,and set my cap on the one side, and, sir, grew to be a justice ofpeace to the devil: at last in a great fume, as I am very choleric,and sometimes so hot in my fustian fumes that no man can abide withintwenty yards of me, I start up, and so bombasted the devil, that, sir,he cried out and ran away._Alvi._ This pleasant knave hath made me laugh my fill.Rasni, now Alvida begins her quaff,And drinks a full carouse unto her king._Rasni._ A pledge, my love, as hearty as great JoveDrunk when his Juno heav'd a bowl to him.--Frolic, my lords; let all the standards walk,[119]Ply it till every man hath ta'en his load.--How now, sirrah, what cheer? we have no words of you._Adam._ Truly, sir, I was in a brown study about my mistress._Alvi._ About me! for what?_Adam,_ Truly, mistress, to think what a golden sentence you did speak:all the philosophers in the world could not have said more:--"What,come, let him want no drink." O, wise speech!    _Alvi._ Villains, why skink you unto this fellow?    He makes me blithe and merry in my thoughts:    Heard you not that the king hath given command,    That all be drunk this day within his court    In quaffing to the health of Alvida?    [_Drink given to_ ADAM.     _Enter_ JONAS.    _Jonas._ Repent, repent, ye men of Nineveh, repent!    The Lord hath spoke, and I do cry it out,    There are as yet but forty days remaining,    And then shall Nineveh be overthrown:    Repent, ye men of Nineveh, repent!_Rasni._ What fellow's this, that thus disturbs our feastWith outcries and alarums to repent?_Adam._ O sir, 'tis one Goodman Jonas, that is come from Jericho; andsurely I think he hath seen some spirit by the way, and is fallen outof his wits, for he never leaves crying night nor day. My master heardhim, and he shut up his shop, gave me my indenture, and he and his wifedo nothing but fast and pray._Jonas._ Repent, ye men of Nineveh, repent!_Rasni._ Come hither, fellow: what art, and from whence comest thou?    _Jonas._ Rasni, I am a prophet of the Lord,    Sent hither by the mighty God of hosts,    To cry destruction to the Ninevites.    O Nineveh, thou harlot of the world,    I raise thy neighbours round about thy bounds,    To come and see thy filthiness and sin!    Thus saith the Lord, the mighty God of hosts:    Your king loves chambering and wantonness;    Whoredom and murder do distain his court;    He favoureth covetous and drunken men;    Behold, therefóre, all like a strumpet foul,    Thou shalt be judg'd and punish'd for thy crime;    The foe shall pierce the gates with iron ramps,    The fire shall quite consume thee from above,    The houses shall be burnt, the infants slain,    And women shall behold their husbands die.    Thine eldest sister is Samaria,[120]    And Sodom on thy right hand seated is.    Repent, ye men of Nineveh, repent!    The Lord hath spoke, and I do cry it out,    There are as yet but forty days remaining,    And then shall Nineveh be overthrown.    [_Offers to depart._    _Rasni._ Stay, prophet, stay.    _Jonas._ Disturb not him that sent me;    Let me perform the message of the Lord. [_Exit._    _Rasni._ My soul is buried in the hell of thoughts.--    Ah, Alvida, I look on thee with shame!--    My lords on sudden fix their eyes on ground,    As if dismay'd to look upon the heavens.--    Hence, Magi, who have flattered me in sin!    [_Exeunt_ Magi.    Horror of mind, disturbance of my soul,    Make me aghast for Nineveh's mishap.    Lords, see proclaim'd, yea, see it straight proclaim'd,    That man and beast, the woman and her child,    For forty days in sack and ashes fast:    Perhaps the Lord will yield, and pity us.--    Bear hence these wretched blandishments of sin,    [_Taking off his crown and robe._    And bring me sackcloth to attire your king:    Away with pomp! my soul is full of woe.--    In pity look on Nineveh, O God!    [_Exeunt all except_ ALVIDA _and_ Ladies.    _Alvi._ Assail'd with shame, with horror overborne,    To sorrow sold, all guilty of our sin,    Come, ladies, come, let us prepare to pray.    Alas, how dare we look on heavenly light,    That have despis'd the maker of the same?    How may we hope for mercy from above,    That still despise the warnings from above?    Woe's me, my conscience is a heavy foe.    O patron of the poor oppress'd with sin,    Look, look on me, that now for pity crave!    Assail'd with shame, with horror overborne,    To sorrow sold, all guilty of our sin,    Come, ladies, come, let us prepare to pray. [_Exeunt._SCENE II.--_A Street near the Temple._ _Enter the_ Usurer, _with a halter in one hand, a dagger in the other._[121]    _Usurer._ Groaning in conscience, burden'd with my crimes,    The hell of sorrow haunts me up and down.    Tread where I list, methinks the bleeding ghosts    Of those whom my corruption brought to naught    Do serve for stumbling-blocks before my steps;    The fatherless and widow wrong'd by me,    The poor oppressèd by my usury,    Methinks I see their hands rear'd up to heaven,    To cry for vengeance of my covetousness.    Whereso I walk, all sigh and shun my way;    Thus am I made a monster of the world:    Hell gapes for me, heaven will not hold my soul.    You mountains, shroud me from the God of truth:    Methinks I see him sit to judge the earth;    See how he blots me out o' the book of life!    O burden, more than Ætna, that I bear!    Cover me, hills, and shroud me from the Lord;    Swallow me, Lycus, shield me from the Lord.    In life no peace: each murmuring that I hear,    Methinks the sentence of damnation sounds,    "Die, reprobate, and hie thee hence to hell."    [_The_ Evil Angel _tempts him, offering the knife and rope._    What fiend is this that tempts me to the death?    What, is my death the harbour of my rest?    Then let me die:--what second charge is this?    Methinks I hear a voice amidst mine ears,    That bids me stay, and tells me that the Lord    Is merciful to those that do repent.    May I repent? O thou, my doubtful soul,    Thou mayst repent, the judge is merciful!    Hence, tools of wrath, stales[122] of temptation!    For I will pray and sigh unto the Lord;    In sackcloth will I sigh, and fasting pray:    O Lord, in rigour look not on my sins!    [_He sits down in sackcloth, his hands and eyes reared to heaven._     _Enter_ ALVIDA _with her_ Ladies, _with dispersed locks._    _Alvi._ Come, mournful dames, lay off your broider'd locks,    And on your shoulders spread dispersèd hairs:    Let voice of music cease where sorrow dwells:    Clothèd in sackcloth, sigh your sins with me;    Bemoan your pride, bewail your lawless lusts;    With fasting mortify your pamper'd loins:    O, think upon the horror of your sins,    Think, think with me, the burden of your blames!    Woe to thy pomp, false beauty, fading flower,    Blasted by age, by sickness, and by death!    Woe to our painted cheeks, our curious oils,    Our rich array, that foster'd us in sin!    Woe to our idle thoughts, that wound our souls!    O, would to God all nations might receive    A good example by our grievous fall!    _First Lady._ You that are planted there where pleasure dwells,    And think your pomp as great as Nineveh's,    May fall for sin as Nineveh doth now.    _Alvi._ Mourn, mourn, let moan be all your melody,    And pray with me, and I will pray for all:--    O Lord of heaven, forgive us our misdeeds!    _Ladies._ O Lord of heaven, forgive us our misdeeds!    _Usurer._ O Lord of light, forgive me my misdeeds!     _Enter_ RASNI, _with his_ Kings _and_ Lords _in sackcloth._    _K. of Cil._ Be not so overcome with grief, O king,    Lest you endanger life by sorrowing so.    _Rasni._ King of Cilicia, should I cease my grief,    Whereas my swarming sins afflict my soul?    Vain man, know this, my burden greater is    Than every private subject's in my land.    My life hath been a loadstar unto them,    To guide them in the labyrinth of blame:    Thus I have taught them for to do amiss;    Then must I weep, my friend, for their amiss.    The fall of Nineveh is wrought by me:    I have maintain'd this city in her shame;    I have contemn'd the warnings from above;    I have upholden incest, rape, and spoil;    'Tis I, that wrought the sin, must weep the sin.    O, had I tears like to the silver streams    That from the Alpine mountains sweetly stream,    Or had I sighs, the treasures of remorse,    As plentiful as Æolus hath blasts,    I then would tempt the heavens with my laments,    And pierce the throne of mercy by my sighs!    _K. of Cil._ Heavens are propitious unto faithful prayers.    _Rasni._ But after we repent, we must lament,    Lest that a worser mischief doth befall.    O, pray: perhaps the Lord will pity us.--    O God of truth, both merciful and just,    Behold, repentant men, with piteous eyes    We wail the life that we have led before:    O, pardon, Lord! O, pity Nineveh!    _All._ O, pardon, Lord! O, pity Nineveh!    _Rasni._ Let not the infants, dallying on the teat,    For fathers' sins in judgment be oppress'd!    _K. of Cil._ Let not the painful mothers big with child,    The innocents, be punish'd for our sin!    _Rasni._ O, pardon, Lord! O, pity Nineveh!    _All._ O, pardon, Lord! O, pity Nineveh!    _Rasni._ O Lord of heaven, the virgins weep to thee!    The covetous man sore sorry for his sin,    The prince and poor, all pray before thy throne;    And wilt thou, then, be wroth with Nineveh?    _K. of Cil._ Give truce to prayer, O king, and rest a space.    _Rasni._ Give truce to prayers, when times require no truce?    No, princes, no. Let all our subjects hie    Unto our temples, where, on humbled knees,    I will expect some mercy from above.    [_They all enter the temple._SCENE III.--_Outside the City of Nineveh._ _Enter_ JONAS.    _Jonas._ This is the day wherein the Lord hath said    That Nineveh shall quite be overthrown;    This is the day of horror and mishap,    Fatal unto the cursèd Ninevites.    These stately towers shall in thy watery bounds,    Swift-flowing Lycus, find their burials:    These palaces, the pride of Assur's kings,    Shall be the bowers of desolation,    Whereas the solitary bird shall sing,    And tigers train their young ones to their nest.    O all ye nations bounded by the west,    Ye happy isles where prophets do abound,    Ye cities famous in the western world,    Make Nineveh a precedent for you!    Leave lewd desires, leave covetous delights,    Fly usury, let whoredom be exil'd,    Lest you with Nineveh be overthrown.    Lo, how the sun's inflamèd torch prevails,    Scorching the parchèd furrows of the earth!    Here will I sit me down, and fix mine eye    Upon the ruins of yon wretched town;    And, lo, a pleasant shade, a spreading vine,    To shelter Jonas in this sunny heat!    What means my God? the day is done and spent;    Lord, shall my prophecy be brought to naught?    When falls the fire? when will the judge be wroth?    I pray thee, Lord, remember what I said,    When I was yet within my country-land:    Jehovah is too merciful, I fear.    O, let me fly, before a prophet fault!    For thou art merciful, the Lord my God,    Full of compassion, and of sufferance,    And dost repent in taking punishment.    Why stays thy hand? O Lord, first take my life,    Before my prophecy be brought to naught!    [_A serpent devours the vine._    Ah, he is wroth! behold, the gladsome vine,    That did defend me from the sunny heat,    Is wither'd quite, and swallow'd by a serpent!    Now furious Phlegon triumphs on my brows,    And heat prevails, and I am faint in heart.     _Enter the_ Angel.    _Angel._ Art thou so angry, Jonas? tell me why.    _Jonas._ Jehovah, I with burning heat am plung'd,    And shadow'd only by a silly vine;    Behold, a serpent hath devourèd it:    And lo, the sun, incens'd by eastern wind,    Afflicts me with canicular aspéct.    Would God that I might die! for, well I wot,    'Twere better I were dead then rest alive.    _Angel._ Jonas, art thou so angry for the vine?    _Jonas._ Yea, I am angry to the death, my God.    _Angel._ Thou hast compassion, Jonas, on a vine,    On which thou never labour didst bestow;    Thou never gav'st it life or power to grow,    But suddenly it sprung, and suddenly died:    And should not I have great compassion    On Nineveh, the city of the world,    Wherein there are a hundred thousand souls,    And twenty thousand infants that ne wot[123]    The right hand from the left, beside much cattle?    O Jonas, look into their temples now,    And see the true contrition of their king,    The subjects' tears, the sinners' true remorse!    Then from the Lord proclaim a mercy-day,    For he is pitiful as he is just.[124]    _Jonas._ I go, my God, to finish thy command.    [_Exit_ Angel.    O, who can tell the wonders of my God,    Or talk his praises with a fervent tongue?    He bringeth down to hell, and lifts to heaven;    He draws the yoke of bondage from the just,    And looks upon the heathen with piteous eyes:    To him all praise and honour be ascrib'd.    O, who can tell the wonders of my God?    He makes the infant to proclaim his truth,    The ass to speak to save the prophet's life,    The earth and sea to yield increase for man.    Who can describe the compass of his power,    Or testify in terms his endless might?    My ravish'd sprite, O, whither dost thou wend?    Go and proclaim the mercy of my God;    Relieve the careful-hearted Ninevites;    And, as thou wert the messenger of death,    Go bring glad tidings of recover'd grace. [_Exit._SCENE IV.--_Within the City of Nineveh._ _Enter_ ADAM, _with a bottle of beer in one slop,_[125] _and a great piece of beef in another.__Adam._ Well, Goodman Jonas, I would you had never come from Jewry tothis country; you have made me look like a lean rib of roast beef, orlike the picture of Lent painted upon a red-herring's cob.[126] Alas,masters, we are commanded by the proclamation to fast and pray! by mytroth, I could prettily so-so away with[127] praying; but for fasting,why, 'tis so contrary to my nature, that I had rather suffer a shorthanging than a long fasting. Mark me, the words be these, "Thou shalttake no manner of food for so many days." I had as lief he should havesaid, "Thou shalt hang thyself for so many days." And yet, in faith,I need not find fault with the proclamation, for I have a buttery anda pantry and a kitchen about me; for proof, _ecce signum!_ this rightslop is my pantry, behold a manchet[128] [_Draws it out_]; this placeis my kitchen, for, lo, a piece of beef [_Draws it out_],--O, let merepeat that sweet word again! "for, lo, a piece of beef." This is mybuttery, for, see, see, my friends, to my great joy, a bottle of beer[_Draws it out_]. Thus, alas, I make shift to wear out this fasting; Idrive away the time. But there go searchers about to seek if any manbreaks the king's command. O, here they be; in with your victuals,Adam. [_Puts them back into his slops._ _Enter Two_ Searchers._First Search._ How duly the men of Nineveh keep the proclamation! howare they armed to repentance! We have searched through the whole city,and have not as yet found one that breaks the fast._Sec. Search._ The sign of the more grace:--but stay, here sits one,methinks, at his prayers; let us see who it is._First Search._ 'Tis Adam, the smith's man.--How now, Adam?_Adam._ Trouble me not; "Thou shalt take no manner of food, but fastand pray."_First Search._ How devoutly he sits at his orisons! but stay, methinksI feel a smell of some meat or bread about him._Sec. Search._ So thinks me too.--You, sirrah, what victuals have youabout you?_Adam._ Victuals! O horrible blasphemy! Hinder me not of my prayer,nor drive me not into a choler. Victuals! why, heardest thou not thesentence, "Thou shalt take no food, but fast and pray"?_Sec. Search._ Truth, so it should be; but, methinks, I smell meatabout thee._Adam._ About me, my friends! these words are actions in the case.About me! no, no, hang those gluttons that cannot fast and pray._First Search._ Well, for all your words, we must search you._Adam._ Search me! take heed what you do; my hose[129] are my castles,'tis burglary if you break ope a slop; no officer must lift up an ironhatch; take heed, my slops are iron. [_They search_ ADAM.]_Sec. Search._ O villain!--see how he hath gotten victuals, bread,beef, and beer, where the king commanded upon pain of death none shouldeat for so many days, no, not the sucking infant!_Adam._ Alas, sir, this is nothing but a _modicum non nocet ut medicusdaret_; why, sir, a bit to comfort my stomach._First Search._ Villain, thou shalt be hanged for it._Adam._ These are your words, "I shall be hanged for it"; but firstanswer me to this question, how many days have we to fast still?_Sec. Search._ Five days._Adam._ Five days! a long time: then I must be hanged?_First Search._ Ay, marry, must thou._Adam._ I am your man, I am for you, sir, for I had rather be hangedthan abide so long a fast. What, five days! Come, I'll untruss. Isyour halter, and the gallows, the ladder, and all such furniture inreadiness?_First Search._ I warrant thee, shalt want none of these._Adam._ But hear you, must I be hanged?_First Search._ Ay, marry._Adam._ And for eating of meat. Then, friends, know ye by thesepresents, I will eat up all my meat, and drink up all my drink, for itshall never be said, I was hanged with an empty stomach._First Search._ Come away, knave; wilt thou stand feeding now?_Adam._ If you be so hasty, hang yourself an hour, while I come to you,for surely I will eat up my meat._Sec. Search._ Come, let's draw him away perforce._Adam._ You say there is five days yet to fast; these are your words?_Sec. Search._ Ay, sir._Adam._ I am for you: come, let's away, and yet let me be put in theChronicles. [_Exeunt._SCENE V.--_The Palace of_ RASNI. _Enter_ JONAS, RASNI, ALVIDA, _the_ KING OF CILICIA, _and other_ Kings, _royally attended._    _Jonas._ Come, careful king, cast off thy mournful weeds,    Exchange thy cloudy looks to smoothèd smiles;    Thy tears have pierc'd the piteous throne of grace,    Thy sighs, like incense pleasing to the Lord,    Have been peace-offerings for thy former pride:    Rejoice, and praise his name that gave thee peace.    And you, fair nymphs, ye lovely Ninevites,    Since you have wept and fasted 'fore the Lord,    He graciously hath temper'd his revenge:    Beware henceforth to tempt him any more:    Let not the niceness of your beauteous looks    Engraft in you a high-presuming mind;    For those that climb he casteth to the ground,    And they that humble be he lifts aloft.    _Rasni._ Lowly I bend with awful bent of eye,    Before the dread Jehovah, God of hosts,    Despising all profane device of man.    Those lustful lures, that whilom led awry    My wanton eyes, shall wound my heart no more;    And she, whose youth in dalliance I abus'd,    Shall now at last become my wedlock-mate.--    Fair Alvida, look not so wo-begone;    If for thy sin thy sorrow do exceed,    Blessèd be thou; come, with a holy band    Let's knit a knot to salve our former shame.    _Alvi._ With blushing looks, betokening my remorse,    I lowly yield, my king, to thy behest,    So as this man of God shall think it good.    _Jonas._ Woman, amends may never come too late;    A will to practise good is virtuous:    The God of heaven, when sinners do repent,    Doth more rejoice than in ten thousand just.    _Rasni._ Then witness, holy prophet, our accord.    _Alvi._ Plight in the presence of the Lord thy God.    _Jonas._ Blest may you be, like to the flowering sheaves    That play with gentle winds in summer-tide;    Like olive-branches let your children spread,    And as the pines in lofty Lebanon,    Or as the kids that feed on Sepher[130] plains,    So be the seed and offspring of your loins!     _Enter the_ Usurer, THRASYBULUS, _and_ ALCON.    _Usurer._ Come forth, my friends, whom wittingly I wrong'd:    Before this man of God receive your due;    Before our king I mean to make my peace.--    Jonas, behold, in sign of my remorse,    I here restore into these poor men's hands    Their goods which I unjustly have detain'd;    And may the heavens so pardon my misdeeds    As I am penitent for my offence!    _Thras._ And what through want from others I purloin'd,    Behold, O king, I proffer 'fore thy throne,    To be restor'd to such as owe[131] the same.    _Jonas._ A virtuous deed, pleasing to God and man.    Would God, all cities drownèd in like shame    Would take example of these Ninevites.    _Rasni._ Such be the fruits of Nineveh's repent;    And such for ever may our dealings be,    That he that call'd us home in height of sin    May smile to see our hearty penitence.--    Viceroys, proclaim a fast unto the Lord;    Let Israel's God be honour'd in our land;    Let all occasion of corruption die,    For who shall fault therein shall suffer death    Bear witness, God, of my unfeignèd zeal.--    Come, holy man, as thou shalt counsel me,    My court and city shall reformèd be.    _Jonas._ Wend on in peace, and prosecute this course.    [_Exeunt all except_ JONAS.    You islanders, on whom the milder air    Doth sweetly breathe the balm of kind increase,    Whose lands are fatten'd with the dew of heaven,    And made more fruitful than Actæan plains;    You whom delicious pleasures dandle soft,    Whose eyes are blinded with security,    Unmask yourselves, cast error clean aside.    O London, maiden of the mistress-isle,    Wrapt in the folds and swathing-clouts of shame,    In thee more sins than Nineveh contains!    Contempt of God, despite of reverend age,    Neglect of law, desire to wrong the poor,    Corruption, whoredom, drunkenness, and pride.    Swoll'n are thy brows with impudence and shame,    O proud adulterous glory of the west!    Thy neighbours burn, yet dost thou fear no fire;    Thy preachers cry, yet dost thou stop thine ears;    The 'larum rings, yet sleepest thou secure.    London, awake, for fear the Lord do frown:    I set a looking-glass before thine eyes.    O, turn, O, turn, with weeping to the Lord,    And think the prayers and virtues of thy queen    Defer the plague which otherwise would fall!    Repent, O London! lest for thine offence,    Thy shepherd fail, whom mighty God preserve,    That she may bide the pillar of his church    Against the storms of Romish Anti-Christ!    The hand of mercy overshade her head,    And let all faithful subjects say, Amen!    [_Exit._

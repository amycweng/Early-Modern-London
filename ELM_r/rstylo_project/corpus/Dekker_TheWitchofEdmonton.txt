Author: Thomas DekkerTitle: _THE WITCH OF EDMONTON._The Witch of Edmonton, which was probably first performed in1623, was not published until thirty-five years later, in 1658.It was then issued in the usual quarto form, with the title:_The Witch of Edmonton_: ﾒA known True Story. Composed into aTragi-Comedy by divers well-esteemed Poets, William Rowley,Thomas Dekker, John Ford, &c. Acted by the Princeﾕs Servants,often at the Cock-Pit in Drury-Lane, once at Court, withsingular Applause.ﾓ The best modern reprint of the play is thatin the Gifford-Dyce edition of Ford, upon which the presentversion is based.It is impossible to assign the exact share of the variousauthors in the play. The business of the Witch, the rusticchorus, and certain other parts mark themselves out as mainlyDekkerﾕs. The conception of Sir Arthur Clarington, and thesubsidiary domestic plot is no doubt mainly Fordﾕs. Rowleyﾕsshare is more difficult to ascertain. The intimate collaborationof all three can alone be held accountable for some of thescenes, and indeed in even the passages most characteristic ofany one of the authors, the touch of another often shows itselfin a chance word or phrase.The justification for the description of the play as ﾒA knowntrue storyﾓ is a pamphlet written by Henry Goodcole, andpublished at London in 1621, giving an account of one ElizabethSawyer, late of Islington, who was ﾒexecuted in 1621 forwitchcraft.ﾓ See Caulfieldﾕs ﾒPortraits, Memoirs, and Charactersof Remarkable Persons,ﾓ 1794. No existing copy of the pamphletis known, but the British Museum possesses copies of two ofGoodcoleﾕs other pamphlets on similar subjects.[Illustration: PROLOGUE.]The town of Edmonton hath lent the stageA Devil[411] and a Witch, both in an age.To make comparisons it were uncivilBetween so even a pair, a Witch and Devil;But as the year doth with his plenty bringAs well a latter as a former spring,So hath this Witch enjoyed the first, and reasonPresumes she may partake the other season:In acts deserving name, the proverb says,ﾒOnce good, and ever;ﾓ why not so in plays?Why not in this? since, gentlemen, we flatterNo expectation; here is mirth and matter.[411] An allusion to the popular old play of _The Merry Devil ofEdmonton_, written about twenty years previously.MASTER BIRD._The whole argument of the play is this distich._Forced marriage, murder; murder blood requires:Reproach, revenge; revenge hellﾕs help desires.[Illustration: _DRAMATIS PERSONｮ._]Sir ARTHUR CLARINGTON._Old Thorney_, a Gentleman.CARTER, a Rich Yeoman.WARBECK, }SOMERTON,} Suitors To Carterﾕs Daughters.FRANK, Thorneyﾕs Son.OLD BANKS, a Countryman.CUDDY BANKS, his Son.RATCLIFFE, } Countrymen.HAMLUC,    }Morris-dancers.SAWGUT, an old Fiddler.A Dog, a Familiar.A Spirit.Countrymen, Justice, Constable, Officers, Serving-men and Maids.Mother SAWYER, the Witch.ANN, Ratcliffeﾕs Wife.SUSAN,     }KATHERINE, } Carterﾕs Daughters.WINNIFRED, Sir Arthurﾕs Maid.SCENE--The town and neighbourhood of EDMONTON; in theend of the last act, LONDON._THE WITCH OF EDMONTON._ACT THE FIRST.SCENE I.--_The neighbourhood of Edmonton. A Room in the House of~Sir~_ ARTHUR CLARINGTON._Enter_ FRANK THORNEY _and_ WINNIFRED, _who is with child_.Frank. Come, wench; why, hereﾕs a business soon dispatched:Thy heart I know is now at ease; thou needﾕst notFear what the tattling gossips in their cupsCan speak against thy fame; thy child shall knowWhom to call dad now._Win._                You have here dischargedThe true part of an honest man; I cannotRequest a fuller satisfactionThan you have freely granted: yet methinksﾕTis an hard case, being lawful man and wife,We should not live together._Frank._                     Had I failedIn promise of my truth to thee, we mustHave then been ever sundered; now the longestOf our forbearing eitherﾕs companyIs only but to gain a little timeFor our continuing thrift; that so hereafterThe heir that shall be born may not have causeTo curse his hour of birth, which made him feelThe misery of beggary and want,--Two devils that are occasions to enforceA shameful end. My plots aim but to keepMy fatherﾕs love._Win._            And that will be as difficultTo be preserved, when he shall understandHow you are married, as it will be now,Should you confess it to him._Frank._                      Fathers areWon by degrees, not bluntly, as our mastersOr wrong重 friends are; and besides Iﾕll useSuch dutiful and ready means, that ereHe can have notice of whatﾕs past, thﾕ inheritanceTo which I am born heir shall be assured;That done, why, let him know it: if he like it not,Yet he shall have no power in him leftTo cross the thriving of it._Win._                       You who hadThe conquest of my maiden-love may easilyConquer the fears of my distrust. And whitherMust I be hurried?_Frank._           Prithee do not useA word so much unsuitable to the constantAffections of thy husband: thou shalt liveNear Waltham Abbey with thy uncle Selman;I have acquainted him with all at large:Heﾕll use thee kindly; thou shalt want no pleasures,Nor any other fit supplies whateverThou canst in heart desire._Win._                      All these are nothingWithout your company._Frank._              Which thou shalt haveOnce every month at least._Win._                     Once every month!Is this to have an husband?_Frank._                    Perhaps oftener;Thatﾕs as occasion serves._Win._                      Ay, ay; in caseNo other beauty tempt your eye, whom youLike better, I may chance to be remembered,And see you now and then. Faith, I did hopeYouﾕd not have used me so: ﾕtis but my fortune.And yet, if not for my sake, have some pityUpon the child I go with; thatﾕs your own:And ﾕless youﾕll be a cruel-hearted father,You cannot but remember that.Heaven knows how--_Frank._            To quit which fear at once,As by the ceremony late performedI plighted thee a faith as free from challengeAs any double thought; once more, in hearingOf Heaven and thee, I vow that never henceforthDisgrace, reproof, lawless affections, threats,Or what can be suggested ﾕgainst our marriage,Shall cause me falsify that bridal oathThat binds me thine. And, Winnifred, wheneverThe wanton heat of youth, by subtle baitsOf beauty, or what womanﾕs art can practise,Draw me from only loving thee, let HeavenInflict upon my life some fearful ruin!I hope thou dost believe me._Win._                        Swear no more;I am confirmed, and will resolve to doWhat you think most behoveful for us._Frank._                               Thus, then;Make thyself ready; at the furthest houseUpon the green without the town, your uncleExpects you. For a little time, farewell!_Win._                                     Sweet,We shall meet again as soon as thou canst possibly?_Frank._ We shall. One kiss--away!      [_Exit_ WINNIFRED._Enter_ SIR ARTHUR CLARINGTON._Sir Arth._                       Frank Thorney!_Frank._                                         Here, sir._Sir Arth._ Alone? then must I tell thee in plain termsThou hast wronged thy masterﾕs house basely and lewdly._Frank._ Your house, sir?_Sir Arth._               Yes, sir: if the nimble devilThat wantoned in your blood rebelled againstAll rules of honest duty, you might, sir,Have found out some more fitting place than hereTo have built a stews in. All the country whispersHow shamefully thou hast undone a maid,Approved for modest life, for civil carriage,Till thy prevailing perjuries enticed herTo forfeit shame. Will you be honest yet,Make her amends and marry her?_Frank._                       So, sir,I might bring both myself and her to beggary;And that would be a shame worse than the other._Sir Arth._ You should have thought on this before, and thenYour reason would have overswayed the passionOf your unruly lust. But that you mayBe left without excuse, to salve the infamyOf my disgrac重 house, and ﾕcause you areA gentleman, and both of you my servants,Iﾕll make the maid a portion._Frank._                      So you promised meBefore, in case I married her. I knowSir Arthur Clarington deserves the creditReport hath lent him, and presume you areA debtor to your promise: but uponWhat certainty shall I resolve? Excuse meFor being somewhat rude._Sir Arth._              It is but reason.Well, Frank, what thinkﾕst thou of two hundred poundsAnd a continual friend?_Frank._               Though my poor fortunesMight happily prefer me to a choiceOf a far greater portion, yet, to rightA wrong重 maid and to preserve your favour,I am content to accept your proffer._Sir Arth._                          Art thou?_Frank._ Sir, we shall every day have need to employThe use of what you please to give._Sir Arth._                         Thou shall haveﾕt._Frank._ Then I claimYour promise.--We are man and wife._Sir Arth._                         Already?_Frank._ And more than so, sir, I have promised herFree entertainment in her uncleﾕs houseNear Waltham Abbey, where she may securelySojourn, till time and my endeavours workMy fatherﾕs love and liking._Sir Arth._                  Honest Frank!_Frank._ I hope, sir, you will think I cannot keep herWithout a daily charge._Sir Arth._            As for the money,ﾕTis all thine own! and though I cannot make theeA present payment, yet thou shalt be sureI will not fail thee._Frank._             But our occasions--_Sir Arth._                                   Nay, nay,Talk not of your occasions; trust my bounty;It shall not sleep.--Hast married her, iﾕfaith, Frank?ﾕTis well, ﾕtis passing well!--then, Winnifred,Once more thou art an honest woman. Frank,Thou hast a jewel; love her; sheﾕll deserve it.And when to Waltham?_Frank._             She is making ready;Her uncle stays for her._Sir Arth._              Most provident speed.Frank, I will be thy friend, and such a friend!--Thouﾕlt bring her thither?_Frank._                  Sir, I cannot; newlyMy father sent me word I should come to him._Sir Arth._ Marry, and do; I know thou hast a witTo handle him._Frank._       I have a suit tﾕye._Sir Arth._                        What isﾕt?Anything, Frank; command it._Frank._                    That youﾕll pleaseBy letters to assure my father thatI am not married._Sir Arth._      How!_Frank._             Some one or otherHath certainly informed him that I purposedTo marry Winnifred; on which he threatenedTo disinherit me:--to prevent it,Lowly I crave your letters, which he seeingWill credit; and I hope, ere I return,On such conditions as Iﾕll frame, his landsShall be assured._Sir Arth._       But what is there to quit[412]My knowledge of the marriage?[412] _i.e._ Acquit._Frank._                     Why, you were notA witness to it._Sir Arth._      I conceive; and then--His land confirmed, thou wilt acquaint him throughlyWith all thatﾕs past._Frank._             I mean no less._Sir Arth._                          ProvidedI never was made privy toﾕt._Frank._                     Alas, sir,Am I a talker?_Sir Arth._    Draw thyself the letter,Iﾕll put my hand toﾕt. I commend thy policy;Thouﾕrt witty, witty, Frank; nay, nay, ﾕtis fit:Dispatch it._Frank._     I shall write effectually.      [_Exit.__Sir Arth._ Go thy way, cuckoo;--have I caught the young man?One trouble, then, is freed. He that will feastAt otherﾕs cost must be a bold-faced guest._Re-enter_ WINNIFRED _in a riding-suit_.Win, I have heard the news; all now is safe;The worst is past: thy lip, wench [_Kisses her_]: I must bidFarewell, for fashionﾕs sake; but I will visit theeSuddenly, girl. This was cleanly carried;Ha! wasﾕt not, Win?_Win._              Then were my happiness,That I in heart repent I did not bring himThe dower of a virginity. Sir, forgive me;I have been much to blame: had not my lewdness[413]Given way to your immoderate waste of virtue,You had not with such eagerness pursuedThe error of your goodness.[413] This speech is very corrupt. Dyce suggested ﾒlewdnessﾓ inplace of the ﾒlaundressﾓ of the old edition._Sir Arth._                 Dear, dear Win,I hug this art of thine; it shows how cleanlyThou canst beguile, in case occasion serveTo practise; it becomes thee: now we shareFree scope enough, without control or fear,To interchange our pleasures; we will surfeitIn our embraces, wench. Come, tell me, whenWilt thou appoint a meeting?_Win._                       What to do?_Sir Arth._ Good, good, to con the lesson of our loves,Our secret game._Win._           O, blush to speak it further!As youﾕre a noble gentleman, forgetA sin so monstrous: ﾕtis not gently doneTo open a cured wound: I know you speakFor trial; ﾕtroth, you need not._Sir Arth._                      I for trial?Not I, by this good sunshine!_Win._                       Can you nameThat syllable of good, and yet not trembleTo think to what a foul and black intentYou use it for an oath? Let me resolve[414] you:If you appear in any visitationThat brings not with it pity for the wrongsDone to abus重 Thorney, my kind husband,--If you infect mine ear with any breathThat is not thoroughly perfumed with sighsFor former deeds of lust,--may I be cursedEven in my prayers, when I vouchsafeTo see or hear you! I will change my lifeFrom a loose whore to a repentant wife.[414] Assure._Sir Arth._ Wilt thou turn monster now? art not ashamedAfter so many months to be honest at last?Away, away! fie onﾕt!_Win._                My resolutionIs built upon a rock. This very dayYoung Thorney vowed, with oaths not to be doubted,That never any change of love should cancelThe bonds in which we are to either boundOf lasting truth: and shall I, then, for my partUnfile the sacred oath set on recordIn Heavenﾕs book? Sir Arthur, do not studyTo add to your lascivious lust the sinOf sacrilege; for if you but endeavourBy any unchaste word to tempt my constancyYou strive as much as in you lies to ruinA temple hallowed to the purityOf holy marriage. I have said enough;You may believe me._Sir Arth._        Get you to your nunnery;There freeze in your cold cloister: this is fine!_Win._ Good angels guide me! Sir, youﾕll give me leaveTo weep and pray for your conversion?_Sir Arth._                           Yes:Away to Waltham! Pox on your honesty!Had you no other trick to fool me? well,You may want money yet._Win._                  None that Iﾕll send forTo you, for hire of a damnation.When I am gone, think on my just complaint:I was your devil; O, be you my saint! [_Exit.__Sir Arth._ Go, go thy ways; as changeable a baggageAs ever cozened knight: Iﾕm glad Iﾕm rid of her.Honest! marry, hang her! Thorney is my debtor;I thought to have paid him too; but fools have fortune. [_Exit._SCENE II.--_Edmonton. A Room in_ CARTERﾕS _House_._Enter_ OLD THORNEY _and_ CARTER._O. Thor._ You offer, Master Carter, like a gentleman; I cannotfind fault with it, ﾕtis so fair._Car._ No gentleman I, Master Thorney; spare the Mastership,call me by my name, John Carter. Master is a title my father,nor his before him, were acquainted with; honest Hertfordshireyeomen; such an one am I; my word and my deed shall be provedone at all times. I mean to give you no security for themarriage money._O. Thor._ How! no security? although it need not so long as youlive, yet who is he has surety of his life one hour? Men, theproverb says, are mortal; else, for my part, I distrust you not,were the sum double._Car._ Double, treble, more or less, I tell you, Master Thorney,Iﾕll give no security. Bonds and bills are but terriers to catchfools, and keep lazy knaves busy; my security shall be presentpayment. And we here about Edmonton hold present payment as sureas an aldermanﾕs bond in London, Master Thorney._O. Thor._ I cry you mercy, sir; I understood you not._Car._ I like young Frank well, so does my Susan too; the girlhas a fancy to him, which makes me ready in my purse. There beother suitors within, that make much noise to little purpose. IfFrank love Sue, Sue shall have none but Frank. ﾕTis a mannerlygirl, Master Thorney, though but a homely manﾕs daughter; therehave worse faces looked out of black bags, man._O. Thor._ You speak your mind freely and honestly. I marvel myson comes not; I am sure he will be here some time to-day._Car._ To-day or to-morrow, when he comes he shall be welcome tobread, beer, and beef, yeomanﾕs fare; we have no kickshaws: fulldishes, whole bellyfuls. Should I diet three days at one of theslender city-suppers, you might send me to Barber-Surgeonsﾕ hallthe fourth day, to hang up for an anatomy.[415]--Here come theythat--[415] Skeleton._Enter_ WARBECK _with_ SUSAN,SOMERTON _with_ KATHERINE.How now, girls! every day play-day with you? Valentineﾕs daytoo, all by couples? Thus will young folks do when we are laidin our graves, Master Thorney; hereﾕs all the care they take.And how do you find the wenches, gentlemen? have they any mindto a loose gown and a strait shoe? Win ﾕem and wear ﾕem; theyshall choose for themselves by my consent._War._ You speak like a kind father.--Sue, thou hearﾕstThe liberty thatﾕs granted thee; what sayﾕst thou?Wilt thou be mine?_Sus._             Your what, sir? I dare swearNever your wife._War._           Canst thou be so unkind,Considering how dearly I affect thee,Nay, dote on thy perfections?_Sus._                        You are studied,Too scholar-like, in words I understand not.I am too coarse for such a gallantﾕs loveAs you are._War._ By the honour of gentility,--_Sus._ Good sir, no swearing; yea and nay with usPrevail above all oaths you can invent._War._ By this white hand of thine,--_Sus._                                Take a false oath!Fie, fie! flatter the wise; fools not regard it,And one of these am I._War._                 Dost thou despise me?_Car._ Let ﾕem talk on, Master Thorney; I know Sueﾕs mind. Thefly may buzz about the candle, he shall but singe his wings whenallﾕs done; Frank, Frank is he has her heart._Som._ But shall I live in hope, Kate?_Kath._                                Better soThan be a desperate man._Som._ Perhaps thou thinkﾕst it is thy portionI level at: wert thou as poor in fortunesAs thou art rich in goodness, I would ratherBe suitor for the dower of thy virtuesThan twice thy fatherﾕs whole estate; and, prithee,Be thou resolved[416] so.[416] Persuaded._Kath._                 Master Somerton,It is an easy labour to deceiveA maid that will believe menﾕs subtle promises;Yet I conceive of you as worthilyAs I presume you to deserve._Som._                       Which is,As worthily in loving thee sincerelyAs thou art worthy to be so beloved._Kath._ I shall find time to try you._Som._                                Do, Kate, do;And when I fail, may all my joys forsake me!_Car._ Warbeck and Sue are at it still. I laugh to myself,Master Thorney, to see how earnestly he beats the bush, whilethe bird is flown into anotherﾕs bosom. A very unthrift, MasterThorney; one of the country roaring-lads: we have such as wellas the city, and as arrant rake-hells as they are, though notso nimble at their prizes of wit. Sue knows the rascal to anhairﾕs-breadth, and will fit him accordingly._O. Thor._ What is the other gentleman?_Car._ One Somerton; the honester man of the two by five poundin every stone-weight. A civil fellow; he has a fine convenientestate of land in West Ham, by Essex: Master Ranges, that dwellsby Enfield, sent him hither. He likes Kate well; I may tell youI think she likes him as well: if they agree, Iﾕll not hinderthe match for my part. But that Warbeck is such another--I usehim kindly for Master Somertonﾕs sake; for he came hither firstas a companion of his: honest men, Master Thorney, may fall intoknavesﾕ company now and then._War._ Three hundred a-year jointure, Sue._Sus._                                     Where lies it?By sea or by land? I think by sea._War._ Do I look like a captain?_Sus._                           Not a whit, sir.Should all that use the seas be reckoned captains,Thereﾕs not a ship should have a scullion in herTo keep her clean._War._             Do you scorn me, Mistress Susan?Am I a subject to be jeered at?_Sus._                          NeitherAm I a property for you to useAs stale[417] to your fond wanton loose discourse:Pray, sir, be civil.[417] A stalking-horse, cover._War._               Wilt be angry, wasp?_Car._ God-a-mercy, Sue! sheﾕll firk him, on my life, if hefumble with her._Enter_ FRANK.Master Francis Thorney, you are welcome indeed; your fatherexpected your coming. How does the right worshipful knight, SirArthur Clarington, your master?_Frank._ In health this morning.--Sir, my duty._O. Thor._                                      NowYou come as I could wish._War._ [_Aside_]          Frank Thorney, ha!_Sus._ You must excuse me._Frank._                   Virtuous Mistress Susan,Kind Mistress Katharine. [_Kisses them._]--Gentlemen, to bothGood time oﾕ thﾕ day._Som._                The like to you._War._                                 ﾕTis he.A word, friend. [_Aside to Som._] On my life, this is the manStands fair in crossing Susanﾕs love to me._Som._ [_Aside to War._] I think no less; be wise, and take no      notice onﾕt;He that can win her best deserves her._War._ [_Aside to Som._]               MarryA serving-man? mew!_Som._ [_Aside to War._] Prithee, friend, no more._Car._ Gentlemen all, thereﾕs within a slight dinner ready,if you please to taste of it; Master Thorney, Master Francis,Master Somerton.--Why, girls! what huswives! will you spend allyour forenoon in tittle-tattles? away! itﾕs well, iﾕfaith.--Willyou go in, gentlemen?_O. Thor._ Weﾕll follow presently; my son and IHave a few words of business._Car._                       At your pleasure.         [_Exeunt all but_ O. THOR. _and_ FRANK._O. Thor._ I think you guess the reason, Frank, for whichI sent for you._Frank._        Yes, sir._O. Thor._ I need not tell youWith what a labyrinth of dangers dailyThe best part of my whole estateﾕs encumbered;Nor have I any clue to wind it outBut what occasion proffers me; whereinIf you should falter, I shall have the shame,And you the loss. On these two points relyOur happiness or ruin. If you marryWith wealthy Carterﾕs daughter, thereﾕs a portionWill free my land; all which I will instate,[418]Upon the marriage, to you: otherwiseI must be of necessity enforcedTo make a present sale of all; and yet,For aught I know, live in as poor distress,Or worse, than now I do. You hear the sum?I told you thus before; have you considered onﾕt?[418] Make over._Frank._ I have, sir; and however I could wishTo enjoy the benefit of single freedom,--For that I find no disposition in meTo undergo the burthen of that careThat marriage brings with it,--yet, to secureAnd settle the continuance of your credit,I humbly yield to be directed by youIn all commands._O. Thor._       You have already usedSuch thriving protestations to the maidThat she is wholly yours; and--speak the truth--You love her, do you not?_Frank._                  ﾕTwere pity, sir,I should deceive her._O. Thor._            Better youﾕd been unborn.But is your love so steady that you mean,Nay, more, desire, to make her your wife?_Frank._                                  Else, sir,It were a wrong not to be righted._O. Thor._                         True,It were: and you will marry her?_Frank._                         Heaven prosper it,I do intend it._O. Thor._      O, thou art a villain!A devil like a man! Wherein have IOffended all the powers so much, to beFather to such a graceless, godless son?_Frank._ To me, sir, this! O, my cleft heart!_O. Thor._                                    To thee,Son of my curse. Speak truth and blush, thou monster!Hast thou not married Winnifred, a maidWas fellow-servant with thee?_Frank_ [_Aside_].            Some swift spiritHas blown this news abroad; I must outface it._O. Thor._ Dﾕ you study for excuse? why, all the countryIs full onﾕt._Frank._ With your licence, ﾕtis not charitable,Iﾕm sure it is not fatherly, so muchTo be oﾕerswayed with credulous conceitOf mere impossibilities; but fathersAre privileged to think and talk at pleasure._O. Thor._ Why, canst thou yet deny thou hast no wife?_Frank._ What do you take me for? an atheist?One that nor hopes the blessedness of lifeHereafter, neither fears the vengeance dueTo such as make the marriage-bed an inn,Which travellers, day and night,After a toilsome lodging, leave at pleasure?Am I become so insensible of losingThe glory of creationﾕs work, my soul?O, I have lived too long!_O. Thor._                Thou hast, dissembler.Darﾕst thou pers思er yet, and pull down wrathAs hot as flames of hell to strike thee quickInto the grave of horror? I believe thee not;Get from my sight!_Frank._           Sir, though mine innocenceNeeds not a stronger witness than the clearnessOf an unperished conscience, yet for thatI was informed how mainly you had beenPossessed of this untruth,--to quit all scruple,Please you peruse this letter; ﾕtis to you._O. Thor._ From whom?_Frank._              Sir Arthur Clarington, my master._O. Thor._ Well, sir.      [_Reads.__Frank_ [_Aside_].    On every side I am distracted;Am waded deeper into mischiefThan virtue can avoid; but on I must:Fate leads me; I will follow.--There you readWhat may confirm you._O. Thor._            Yes, and wonder at it.Forgive me, Frank; credulity abused me.My tears express my joy; and I am sorryI injured innocence._Frank._             Alas! I knewYour rage and grief proceeded from your loveTo me; so I conceived it._O. Thor._                My good son,Iﾕll bear with many faults in thee hereafter;Bear thou with mine._Frank._             The peace is soon concluded._Re-enter_ CARTER _and_ SUSAN._Car._ Why, Master Thorney, dﾕye mean to talk out your dinner?the company attends your coming. What must it be, Master Frank?or son Frank? I am plain Dunstable.[419][419] _i.e._ Blunt and honest. An old proverb._O. Thor._ Son, brother, if your daughter like to have it so._Frank._ I dare be confident she is not alteredFrom what I left her at our parting last:--Are you, fair maid?_Sus._              You took too sure possessionOf an engag重 heart._Frank._             Which now I challenge._Car._ Marry, and much good may it do thee, son.Take her to thee; get me a brace of boys at a burthen,Frank; the nursing shall not stand thee in a pennyworthof milk; reach her home and spare not: whenﾕsthe day?_O. Thor._ To-morrow, if you please. To use ceremonyOf charge and custom were to little purpose;Their loves are married fast enough already._Car._ A good motion. Weﾕll eﾕen have an household dinner, andlet the fiddlers go scrape: let the bride and bridegroom danceat night together; no matter for the guests:--to-morrow, Sue,to-morrow.--Shallﾕs to dinner now?_O. Thor._ We are on all sides pleased, I hope._Sus._ Pray Heaven I may deserve the blessing sent me:Now my heart is settled._Frank._ So is mine._Car._ Your marriage-money shall be received before yourwedding-shoes can be pulled on. Blessing on you both!_Frank_ [_Aside_]. No man can hide his shame from Heaven that views him;In vain he flees whose destiny pursues him.      [_Exeunt._ACT THE SECOND.SCENE I.--_The Fields near Edmonton.__Enter_ MOTHER SAWYER _gathering sticks_.Mother Sawyer. And why on me? why should the envious worldThrow all their scandalous malice upon me?ﾕCause I am poor, deformed, and ignorant,And like a bow buckled and bent togetherBy some more strong in mischiefs than myself,Must I for that be made a common sinkFor all the filth and rubbish of menﾕs tonguesTo fall and run into? Some call me witch,And being ignorant of myself, they goAbout to teach me how to be one; urgingThat my bad tongue--by their bad usage made so--Forspeaks[420] their cattle, doth bewitch their corn,Themselves, their servants, and their babes at nurse.This they enforce upon me, and in partMake me to credit it; and here comes oneOf my chief adversaries.[420] Another term for ﾒbewitchﾓ commonly in use; the wordprobably implied the muttering or ﾒforspeakingﾓ of a spell._Enter_ OLD BANKS._O. Banks._ Out, out upon thee, witch!_M. Saw._                             Dost call me witch?_O. Banks._ I do, witch, I do; and worse I would, knew I a namemore hateful. What makest thou upon my ground?_M. Saw._ Gather a few rotten sticks to warm me._O. Banks._ Down with them when I bid thee quickly; Iﾕll makethy bones rattle in thy skin else._M. Saw._ You wonﾕt, churl, cut-throat, miser!--there they be[_Throws them down_]: would they stuck cross thy throat, thybowels, thy maw, thy midriff!_O. Banks._ Sayest thou me so, hag? Out of my ground! [_Beatsher.__M. Saw._ Dost strike me, slave, curmudgeon! Now, thy bonesache, thy joints cramp, and convulsions stretch and crack thysinews!_O. Banks._ Cursing, thou hag! take that and that. [_Beats herand exit.__M. Saw._ Strike, do!--and withered may that hand and armWhose blows have lamed me drop from the rotten trunk.Abuse me! beat me! call me hag and witch!What is the name, where and by what art learned,What spells, what charms, or invocations,May the thing called Familiar be purchased?_Enter_ CUDDY BANKS _and several other ~Clowns~_._Cud._ A new head for the tabor, and silver tipping for thepipe; remember that: and forget not five leash of new bells._1st Cl._ Double bells;--Crooked Lane[421]--ye shall have ﾕemstraight in Crooked Lane:--double bells all, if it be possible.[421] A winding thoroughfare which led from Eastcheap toFish-street-hill._Cud._ Double bells? double coxcombs! trebles, buy me trebles,all trebles; for our purpose is to be in the altitudes._2nd Cl._ All trebles? not a mean?[422][422] ﾒAn inner part between the tenor and the base.ﾓ _BlountﾕsGlossographia_, 1681. It was customary in the morris to adornthe dresses of the dancers, the trappings of the hobby-horse,&c., with bells of different pitch, but arranged to sound inharmony. Hence, ﾒtreble,ﾓ ﾒmean,ﾓ &c._Cud._ Not one. The morris is so cast, weﾕll have neither meannor base in our company, fellow Rowland._3rd Cl._ What! nor a counter?[423][423] Counter-tenor._Cud._ By no means, no hunting counter;[424] leave that toEnfield Chase men: all trebles, all in the altitudes. Now forthe disposing of parts in the morris, little or no labour willserve.[424] Coursing the hare._2nd Cl._ If you that be minded to follow your leader knowme--an ancient honour belonging to our house--for a fore-horseiﾕ thﾕ team and fore-gallant[425] in a morris, my fatherﾕsstable is not unfurnished.[425] The fore-man or fore-gallant of the morris led the otherdancers, and was distinguished by a gayer dress._3rd Cl._ So much for the fore-horse; but how for a goodhobby-horse?_Cud._ For a hobby-horse? let me see an almanac. Midsummer-moon,let me see ye. ﾒWhen the moonﾕs in the full, thenﾕs wit in thewane.ﾓ No more. Use your best skill; your morris will suffer aneclipse._1st Cl._ An eclipse?_Cud._ A strange one._2nd Cl._ Strange?_Cud._ Yes, and most sudden. Remember the fore-gallant, andforget the hobby-horse! The whole body of your morris will bedarkened.--There be of us--but ﾕtis no matter:--forget thehobby-horse!_1st Cl._ Cuddy Banks!--have you forgot since he paced it fromEnfield Chase to Edmonton?--Cuddy, honest Cuddy, cast thy stuff._Cud._ Suffer may ye all! it shall be known, I can take mineease as well as another man. Seek your hobby-horse where you canget him.[426][426] Cuddyﾕs anger arises from the unlucky question asked bythe third clown; ﾒHow shall we do for a good hobby-horse?ﾓ--ashe apparently expected, from his former celebrity inthat respectable character, to have been appointed byacclamation.--_Gifford.__1st Cl._ Cuddy, honest Cuddy, we confess, and are sorry for ourneglect._2nd Cl._ The old horse shall have a new bridle._3rd Cl._ The caparisons new painted._4th Cl._ The tail repaired. The snaffle and the bosses newsaffroned oﾕer._1st Cl._ Kind,--_2nd Cl._ Honest,--_3rd Cl._ Loving, ingenious,--_4th Cl._ Affable Cuddy._Cud._ To show I am not flint, but affable, as you say, verywell stuffed, a kind of warm dough or puff-paste, I relent, Iconnive, most affable Jack. Let the hobby-horse provide a strongback, he shall not want a belly when I am in him--but [_SeeingSawyer_]--ﾕuds me, Mother Sawyer!_1st Cl._ The old Witch of Edmonton!--if our mirth be notcrossed--_2nd Cl._ Bless us, Cuddy, and let her curse her tﾕother eyeout.--What dost now?_Cud._ ﾒUngirt, unblest,ﾓ says the proverb; but my girdle shallserve for a riding knot; and a fig for all the witches inChristendom!--What wouldst thou?_1st Cl._ The devil cannot abide to be crossed._2nd Cl._ And scorns to come at any manﾕs whistle._3rd Cl._ Away--_4th Cl._ With the witch!_All._ Away with the Witch of Edmonton! [_Exeunt in strangepostures.__M. Saw._ Still vexed! still tortured! that curmudgeon BanksIs ground of all my scandal; I am shunnedAnd hated like a sickness; made a scornTo all degrees and sexes. I have heard old beldamsTalk of familiars in the shape of mice,Rats, ferrets, weasels, and I wot not what,That have appeared, and sucked, some say, their blood;But by what means they came acquainted with themI am now ignorant. Would some power, good or bad,Instruct me which way I might be revengedUpon this churl, Iﾕd go out of myself,And give this fury leave to dwell withinThis ruined cottage ready to fall with age,Abjure all goodness, be at hate with prayer,And study curses, imprecations,Blasphemous speeches, oaths, detested oaths,Or anything thatﾕs ill: so I might workRevenge upon this miser, this black cur,That barks and bites, and sucks the very bloodOf me and of my credit. ﾕTis all oneTo be a witch as to be counted one:Vengeance, shame, ruin light upon that canker!_Enter a ~Black Dog~.__Dog._ Ho! have I found thee cursing? now thou artMine own._M. Saw._ Thine! what art thou?_Dog._                          He thou hast so oftenImportuned to appear to thee, the devil._M. Saw._ Bless me! the devil?_Dog._ Come, do not fear; I love thee much too wellTo hurt or fright thee; if I seem terrible,It is to such as hate me. I have foundThy love unfeigned; have seen and pitiedThy open wrongs; and come, out of my love,To give thee just revenge against thy foes._M. Saw._ May I believe thee?_Dog._                        To confirmﾕt, command meDo any mischief unto man or beast,And Iﾕll effect it, on conditionThat, uncompelled, thou make a deed of giftOf soul and body to me._M. Saw._               Out, alas!My soul and body?_Dog._            And that instantly,And seal it with thy blood: if thou deniest,Iﾕll tear thy body in a thousand pieces._M. Saw._ I know not where to seek relief: but shall I,After such covenants sealed, see full revengeOn all that wrong me?_Dog._                Ha, ha! silly woman!The devil is no liar to such as he loves:Didst ever know or hear the devil a liarTo such as he affects?_M. Saw._ Then I am thine; at least so much of meAs I can call mine own--_Dog._                   Equivocations?Art mine or no? speak, or Iﾕll tear--_M. Saw._                             All thine._Dog._ Sealﾕt with thy blood.[_She pricks her arm, which he sucks. Thunder and lightning._                             See! now I dare call thee mine!For proof, command me; instantly Iﾕll runTo any mischief; goodness can I none._M. Saw._ And I desire as little. Thereﾕs an old churl,One Banks--_Dog._      That wronged thee, lamed thee, called thee witch._M. Saw._ The same; first upon him Iﾕd be revenged._Dog._ Thou shalt; do but name how._M. Saw._                           Go, touch his life._Dog._ I cannot._M. Saw._ Hast thou not vowed? Go, kill the slave!_Dog._                                             I wonnot._M. Saw._ Iﾕll cancel, then, my gift._Dog._                      Ha, ha!_M. Saw._                           Dost laugh!Why wilt not kill him?_Dog._                 Fool, because I cannot.Though we have power, know it is circumscribedAnd tied in limits: though he be curst to thee,Yet of himself heﾕs loving to the world,And charitable to the poor: now men that,As he, love goodness, though in smallest measure,Live without compass of our reach. His cattleAnd corn Iﾕll kill and mildew; but his life--Until I take him, as I late found thee,Cursing and swearing--Iﾕve no power to touch._M. Saw._ Work on his corn and cattle, then._Dog._                                       I shall.The Witch of Edmonton shall see his fall;If she at least put credit in my power,And in mine only; make orisons to me,And none but me._M. Saw._        Say how and in what manner._Dog._ Iﾕll tell thee: when thou wishest ill,       Corn, man, or beast wouldst spoil or kill,       Turn thy back against the sun,       And mumble this short orison:       ﾒIf thou to death or shame pursue ﾕem,       _Sanctibicetur nomen tuum_.ﾓ_M. Saw._ ﾒIf thou to death or shame pursue ﾕem,           _Sanctibicetur nomen tuum_.ﾓ_Dog._ Perfect: farewell. Our first-made promisesWeﾕll put in execution against Banks.      [_Exit.__M. Saw._ _Contaminetur nomen tuum._ Iﾕm an expert scholar;Speak Latin, or I know not well what language,As well as the best of ﾕem--but who comes here?_Re-enter_ CUDDY BANKS.The son of my worst foe.        To death pursue ﾕem,        _Et sanctibicetur nomen tuum_._Cud._ Whatﾕs that she mumbles? the devilﾕs paternoster? wouldit were else!--Mother Sawyer, good-morrow._M. Saw._ Ill-morrow to thee, and all the world that floutA poor old woman,        To death pursue ﾕem,        And _sanctibicetur nomen tuum_._Cud._ Nay, good Gammer Sawyer, whateﾕer it pleases my father tocall you, I know you are--_M. Saw._ A witch._Cud._ A witch? would you were else iﾕfaith!_M. Saw._ Your father knows I am by this._Cud._ I would he did._M. Saw._ And so in time may you._Cud._ I would I might else! But, witch or no witch, you are amotherly woman; and though my father be a kind of God-bless-us,as they say, I have an earnest suit to you; and if youﾕll be sokind to ka me one good turn, Iﾕll be so courteous as to kob[427]you another.[427] ﾒKa me, ka thee!ﾓ was an old proverb._M. Saw._ Whatﾕs that? to spurn, beat me, and call me witch,As your kind father doth?_Cud._ My father! I am ashamed to own him. If he has hurt thehead of thy credit, thereﾕs money to buy thee a plaster [_Givesher money_]; and a small courtesy I would require at thy hands._M. Saw._ You seem a good young man, and--[_Aside_] I must dissemble,The better to accomplish my revenge.--But--for this silver, what wouldst have me do?Bewitch thee?_Cud._ No, by no means; I am bewitched already: I would havethee so good as to unwitch me, or witch another with me forcompany._M. Saw._ I understand thee not; be plain, my son._Cud._ As a pike-staff, mother. You know Kate Carter?_M. Saw._ The wealthy yeomanﾕs daughter? what of her?_Cud._ That same party has bewitched me._M. Saw._ Bewitched thee?_Cud._ Bewitched me, _hisce auribus_. I saw a little devil flyout of her eye like a burbolt,[428] which sticks at this hourup to the feathers in my heart. Now, my request is, to send oneof thy what-dﾕye-call-ﾕems either to pluck that out, or stickanother as fast in hers: do, and hereﾕs my hand, I am thine forthree lives.[428] Bird-bolt, arrow; perhaps more correctly ﾒBut-bolt,ﾓ asemendated by Gifford._M. Saw._ [_Aside_] We shall have sport.--Thou art in love with her?_Cud._ Up to the very hilts, mother._M. Saw._ And thou wouldst have me make her love thee too?_Cud._ [_Aside_] I think sheﾕll prove a witch in earnest.--Yes,I could find in my heart to strike her three quarters deep inlove with me too._M. Saw._ But dost thou think that I can doﾕt, and I alone?_Cud._ Truly, Mother Witch, I do verily believe so; and, when Isee it done, I shall be half persuaded so too._M. Saw._ It is enough: what art can do be sure of.Turn to the west, and whatsoeﾕer thou hearﾕstOr seest, stand silent, and be not afraid.[_She stamps on the ground; the ~Dog~ appears, and fawns, andleaps upon her.__Cud._ Afraid, Mother Witch!--ﾒturn my face to the west!ﾓ I saidI should always have a back-friend of her; and now itﾕs out. Anher little devil should be hungry, come sneaking behind me, likea cowardly catchpole, and clap his talons on my haunches--ﾕTiswoundy cold, sure--I dudder and shake like an aspen-leaf everyjoint of me._M. Saw._ To scandal and disgrace pursue ﾕem,          _Et sanctibicetur nomen tuum_.      [_Exit ~Dog~._How now, my son, how isﾕt?_Cud._ Scarce in a clean life, Mother Witch.--But did yourgoblin and you spout Latin together?_M. Saw._ A kind of charm I work by; didst thou hear me?_Cud._ I heard I know not the devil what mumble in a scurvybase tone, like a drum that had taken cold in the head the lastmuster. Very comfortable words; what were they? and who taughtthem you?_M. Saw._ A great learned man._Cud._ Learned man! learned devil it was as soon! But what? whatcomfortable news about the party?_M. Saw._ Who? Kate Carter? Iﾕll tell thee. Thou knowest thestile at the west end of thy fatherﾕs peas-field: be thereto-morrow night after sunset; and the first live thing thouseest be sure to follow, and that shall bring thee to thy love._Cud._ In the peas-field? has she a mind to codlings[429]already? The first living thing I meet, you say, shall bring meto her?[429] Peas codlings; green peas._M. Saw._ To a sight of her, I mean. She will seem wantonly coy,and flee thee; but follow her close and boldly: do but embraceher in thy arms once, and she is thine own._Cud._ ﾒAt the stile at the west end of my fatherﾕs peas-land,the first live thing I see, follow and embrace her, and sheshall be thine.ﾓ Nay, an I come to embracing once, she shall bemine; Iﾕll go near to make at eaglet else. [_Exit.__M. Saw._ A ball well bandied! now the setﾕs half won;The fatherﾕs wrong Iﾕll wreak upon the son.      [_Exit._SCENE II.--CARTERﾕS _House_._Enter_ CARTER, WARBECK, _and_ SOMERTON._Car._ How now, gentlemen! cloudy? I know, Master Warbeck, youare in a fog about my daughterﾕs marriage._War._ And can you blame me, sir?_Car._ Nor you me justly. Wedding and hanging are tied up bothin a proverb; and destiny is the juggler that unties the knot.My hope is, you are reserved to a richer fortune than my poordaughter._War._ However, your promise--_Car._ Is a kind of debt, I confess it._War._ Which honest men should pay._Car._ Yet some gentlemen break in that point now and then, byyour leave, sir._Som._ I confess thou hast had a little wrong in the wench; butpatience is the only salve to cure it. Since Thorney has won thewench, he has most reason to wear her._War._ Love in this kind admits no reason to wear her._Car._ Then Loveﾕs a fool, and what wise man will take exception?_Som._ Come, frolic, Ned: were every man master of his ownfortune, Fate might pick straws, and Destiny go a-wool-gathering._War._ You hold yours in a string, though: ﾕtis well; but ifthere be any equity, look thou to meet the like usage ere long._Som._ In my love to her sister Katherine? Indeed, they are apair of arrows drawn out of one quiver, and should fly at aneven length; if she do run after her sister.--_War._ Look for the same mercy at my hands as I have received atthine._Som._ Sheﾕll keep a surer compass; I have too strong aconfidence to mistrust her._War._ And that confidence is a wind that has blown many amarried man ashore at Cuckoldﾕs Haven, I can tell you; I wishyours more prosperous though._Car._ Whateﾕer your wish, Iﾕll master my promise to him._War._ Yes, as you did to me._Car._ No more of that, if you love me: but for the moreassurance, the next offered occasion shall consummate themarriage; and that once sealed--_Som._ Leave the manage of the rest to my care. But see, thebridegroom and bride come; the new pair of Sheffield knives,fitted both to one sheath._War._ The sheath might have been better fitted, if somebody hadtheir due; but--_Car._ No harsh language, if thou lovest me. Frank Thorney hasdone--_War._ No more than I, or thou, or any man, things so standing,would have attempted._Enter_ FRANK THORNEY _and_ SUSAN._Som._ Good-morrow, Master Bridegroom._War._ Come, give thee joy: mayst thou live long and happyIn thy fair choice!_Frank._ I thank ye, gentlemen; kind Master Warbeck,I find you loving._War._ Thorney, that creature,--much good do thee with her!--Virtue and beauty hold fair mixture in her;Sheﾕs rich, no doubt, in both: yet were she fairer,Thou art right worthy of her. Love her, Thorney;ﾕTis nobleness in thee, in her but duty.The match is fair and equal; the successI leave to censure. Farewell, Mistress Bride!Till now elected, thy old scorn deride.      [_Exit.__Som._ Good Master Thorney--_Car._ Nay, you shall not part till you see the barrels runa-tilt, gentlemen. [_Exit with_ SOMERTON._Sus._ Why change you your face, sweetheart?_Frank._                                     Who, I? for nothing._Sus._ Dear, say not so; a spirit of your constancyCannot endure this change for nothing.I have observed strange variations in you._Frank._ In me?_Sus._ In you, sir.Awake, you seem to dream, and in your sleepYou utter sudden and distracted accents,Like one at enmity with peace. Dear loving husband,If IMay dare to challenge any interest in you,Give me the reason fully; you may trustMy breast as safely as your own._Frank._                         With what?You half amaze me; prithee--_Sus._                       Come, you shall not,Indeed you shall not, shut me from partakingThe least dislike that grieves you; Iﾕm all yours._Frank._ And I all thine._Sus._                    You are not, if you keepThe least grief from me: but I find the cause;It grew from me._Frank._         From you?_Sus._                     From some distasteIn me or my behaviour: youﾕre not kindIn the concealment. ﾕLas, sir, I am young,Silly and plain; more, strange to those contentsA wife should offer: say but in what I fail,Iﾕll study satisfaction._Frank._                 Come; in nothing._Sus._ I know I do; knew I as well in what,You should not long be sullen. Prithee, love,If I have been immodest or too bold,Speakﾕt in a frown; if peevishly too nice,Showﾕt in a smile: thy liking is the glassBy which Iﾕll habit my behaviour._Frank._ Wherefore dost weep now?_Sus._                            You, sweet, have the powerTo make me passionate as an April-day;Now smile, then weep; now pale, then crimson red:You are the powerful moon of my bloodﾕs sea,To make it ebb or flow into my face,As your looks change._Frank._              Change thy conceit, I prithee;Thou art all perfection: Diana herselfSwells in thy thoughts and moderates thy beauty.Within thy left eye amorous Cupid sits,Feathering love-shafts, whose golden heads he dippedIn[430] thy chaste breast; in the other liesBlushing Adonis scarfed in modesties;And still as wanton Cupid blows love-fires,Adonis quenches out unchaste desires;And from these two I briefly do implyA perfect emblem of thy modesty.Then, prithee, dear, maintain no more dispute,For when thou speakﾕst, itﾕs fit all tongues be mute.[430] There is a break here in the quarto. It is suggested thatthe printer was unable to decipher the first word of the line inthe manuscript._Sus._ Come, come, these golden strings of flatteryShall not tie up my speech, sir; I must knowThe ground of your disturbance._Frank._                        Then look here;For here, here is the fen in which this hydraOf discontent grows rank._Sus._                    Heaven shield it! where?_Frank._ In mine own bosom, here the cause has root;The poisoned leeches twist about my heart,And will, I hope, confound me._Sus._                         You speak riddles._Frank._ Takeﾕt plainly, then: ﾕtwas told me by a womanKnown and approved in palmistry,I should have two wives._Sus._                   Two wives? sir, I take itExceeding likely; but let not conceit hurt you:Youﾕre afraid to bury me?_Frank._                  No, no, my Winnifred._Sus._ How say you? Winnifred! you forget me._Frank._ No, I forget myself!--Susan._Sus._                                In what?_Frank._ Talking of wives, I pretend Winnifred,A maid that at my motherﾕs waited on meBefore thyself._Sus._          I hope, sir, she may liveTo take my place: but why should all this move you?_Frank._ The poor girl!--[_Aside.]_ she hasﾕt before thee,And thatﾕs the fiend torments me._Sus._                            Yet why should thisRaise mutiny within you? such presagesProve often false: or say it should be true?_Frank._ That I should have another wife?_Sus._                                    Yes, many;If they be good, the better._Frank._                     Never anyEqual to thee in goodness._Sus._ Sir, I could wish I were much better for you;Yet if I knew your fateOrdained you for another, I could wish--So well I love you and your hopeful pleasure--Me in my grave, and my poor virtues addedTo my successor._Frank._         Prithee, prithee, talk notOf deaths or graves; thou art so rare a goodnessAs Death would rather put itself to deathThan murder thee: but we, as all things else,Are mutable and changing._Sus._                    Yet you still moveIn your first sphere of discontent. Sweet, chaseThose clouds of sorrow, and shine clearly on me._Frank._ At my return I will._Sus._                        Return! ah me!Will you, then, leave me?_Frank._                  For a time I must:But how? As birds their young, or loving beesTheir hives, to fetch home richer dainties._Sus._                                      Leave me!Now has my fear met its effect. You shall not;Cost it my life, you shall not._Frank._                        Why? your reason?_Sus._ Like to the lapwing have you all this whileWith your false love deluded me, pretendingCounterfeit senses for your discontent;And now at last it is by chance stole from you._Frank._ What? what by chance?_Sus._                         Your pre-appointed meetingOf single combat with young Warbeck._Frank._                             Ha!_Sus._ Even so: dissemble not; ﾕtis too apparent:Then in his look I read it:--deny it not,I seeﾕt apparent; cost it my undoing,And unto that my life, I will not leave you._Frank._ Not until when?_Sus._                   Till he and you be friends.Was this your cunning?--and then flam me offWith an old witch, two wives, and Winnifred!Youﾕre not so kind, indeed, as I imagined._Frank._ [_Aside._] And you are more fond by far than I expected.--It is a virtue that attends thy kind--But of our business within: and by this kiss,Iﾕll anger thee no more; ﾕtroth, chuck, I will not._Sus._ You shall have no just cause._Frank._                       Dear Sue, I shall not.    [_Exeunt._ACT THE THIRD.SCENE I.--_The Village Green.__Enter_ CUDDY BANKS _with the ~Morris-dancers~._First Clown. Nay, Cuddy, prithee do not leave us now; if we partall this night, we shall not meet before day._2nd Cl._ I prithee, Banks, letﾕs keep together now._Cud._ If you were wise, a word would serve; but as you are,I must be forced to tell you again, I have a little privatebusiness, an hourﾕs work; it may prove but an half hourﾕs, asluck may serve; and then I take horse, and along with you. Havewe eﾕer a witch in the morris?_1st Cl._ No, no; no womanﾕs part but Maid Marian and theHobby-horse._Cud._ Iﾕll have a witch; I love a witch._1st Cl._ ﾕFaith, witches themselves are so common now-a-days,that the counterfeit will not be regarded. They say we havethree or four in Edmonton besides Mother Sawyer._2nd Cl._ I would she would dance her part with us._3rd Cl._ So would not I; for if she comes, the devil and allcomes along with her._Cud._ Well, Iﾕll have a witch; I have loved a witch ever sinceI played at cherry-pit.[431] Leave me, and get my horse dressed;give him oats: but water him not till I come. Whither do we footit first?[431] A childrenﾕs game, in which cherry-stones are pitched intoa small hole. The suggestion was sometimes a less innocent one,however. Compare Herrickﾕs quatrain on ﾒCherry-pit.ﾓ_2nd Cl._ To Sir Arthur Claringtonﾕs first; then whither thouwilt._Cud._ Well, I am content; but we must up to Carterﾕs, the richyeoman; I must be seen on hobby-horse there._1st Cl._ O, I smell him now!--Iﾕll lay my ears Banks is inlove, and thatﾕs the reason he would walk melancholy by himself._Cud._ Ha! who was that said I was in love?_1st Cl._ Not I._2nd Cl._ Nor I._Cud._ Go to, no more of that: when I understand what you speak,I know what you say; believe that._1st Cl._ Well, ﾕtwas I, Iﾕll not deny it; I meant no hurt inﾕt.I have seen you walk up to Carterﾕs of Chessum: Banks, were notyou there last Shrovetide?_Cud._ Yes, I was ten days together there the last Shrovetide._2nd Cl._ How could that be, when there are but seven days inthe week?_Cud._ Prithee peace! I reckon _stila nova_ as a traveller; thouunderstandest as a fresh-water farmer, that never sawest a weekbeyond sea. Ask any soldier that ever received his pay but inthe Low Countries, and heﾕll tell thee there are eight days inthe week[432] there hard by. How dost thou think they rise inHigh Germany, Italy, and those remoter places?[432] Thus Butler:ﾒThe soldier does it every day,_Eight to the week_, for sixpence pay.ﾓ--_Gifford.__3rd Cl._ Ay, but simply there are but seven days in the weekyet._Cud._ No, simply as thou understandest. Prithee look but inthe loverﾕs almanac: when he has been but three days absent,ﾒO,ﾓ says he, ﾒI have not seen my love these seven years:ﾓthereﾕs a long cut! When he comes to her again and embraces her,ﾒO,ﾓ says he, ﾒnow methinks I am in Heaven;ﾓ and thatﾕs a prettystep! He that can get up to Heaven in ten days need not repenthis journey; you may ride a hundred days in a caroche,[433] andbe further off than when you set forth. But, I pray you, goodmorris-mates, now leave me. I will be with you by midnight.[433] Coach, Fr. _Carrosse_._1st Cl._ Well, since he will be alone, weﾕll back again andtrouble him no more._All the Clowns._ But remember, Banks._Cud._ The hobby-horse shall be remembered. But hark you; getPoldavis, the barberﾕs boy, for the witch, because he can showhis art better than another. [_Exeunt all but_ CUDDY.Well, now to my walk. I am near the place where I should meet--Iknow not what: say I meet a thief? I must follow him, if tothe gallows; say I meet a horse, or hare, or hound? still Imust follow: some slow-paced beast, I hope; yet love is full oflightness in the heaviest lovers. Ha! my guide is come._Enter the ~Dog~._A water-dog! I am thy first man, sculler; I go with thee; ply noother but myself. Away with the boat! land me but at KatherineﾕsDock, my sweet Katherineﾕs Dock, and Iﾕll be a fare to thee.That way? nay, which way thou wilt; thou knowest the way betterthan I:--fine gentle cur it is, and well brought up, I warranthim. We go a-ducking, spaniel; thou shalt fetch me the ducks,pretty kind rascal._Enter a ~Spirit~ vizarded. He throws off his mask, &c., andappears in the shape of_ KATHERINE._Spir._ Thus throw I off mine own essential horror,And take the shape of a sweet lovely maidWhom this fool dotes on: we can meet his folly,But from his virtues must be runaways.Weﾕll sport with him; but when we reckoning call,We know where to receive; the witch pays for all.    [_The ~Dog~ barks.__Cud._ Ay? is that the watchword? Sheﾕs come. [_Sees the~Spirit~._] Well, if ever we be married, it shall be at BarkingChurch,[434] in memory of thee: now come behind, kind cur.[434] Barking Church stood at the bottom of Seething Lane. Itwas destroyed in the great fire.--_Gifford._And have I met thee, sweet Kate?I will teach thee to walk so late.O, see, we meet in metre. [_The ~Spirit~ retires as headvances._] What! dost thou trip from me? O, that I were upon myhobby-horse, I would mount after thee so nimble! ﾒStay, nymph,stay, nymph,ﾓ singed Apollo.Tarry and kiss me, sweet nymph, stay;    Tarry and kiss me, sweet:    We will to Chessum Street,And then to the house stands in the highway.Nay, by your leave, I must embrace you. [_Exit, following the~Spirit~._[_Within._] O, help, help! I am drowned, I am drowned!_Re-enter_ CUDDY _wet_._Dog._ Ha, ha, ha, ha!_Cud._ This was an ill night to go a-wooing in; I find it nowin Pondﾕs almanac: thinking to land at Katherineﾕs Dock, I wasalmost at Gravesend. Iﾕll never go to a wench in the dog-daysagain; yet ﾕtis cool enough.--Had you never a paw in thisdog-trick? a mange take that black hide of yours! Iﾕll throw youin at Limehouse in some tannerﾕs pit or other._Dog._ Ha, ha, ha, ha!_Cud._ How now! whoﾕs that laughs at me? Hist to him! [_The~Dog~ barks._]--Peace, peace! thou didst but thy kind neither;ﾕtwas my own fault._Dog._ Take heed how thou trustest the devil another time._Cud._ How now! whoﾕs that speaks? I hope you have not yourreading tongue about you?_Dog._ Yes, I can speak._Cud._ The devil you can! you have read ｮsopﾕs fables, then; Ihave played one of your parts then,--the dog that catched at theshadow in the water. Pray you, let me catechise you a little;what might one call your name, dog?_Dog._ My dame calls me Tom._Cud._ ﾕTis well, and she may call me Ass; so thereﾕs an wholeone betwixt us, Tom-Ass: she said I should follow you, indeed.Well, Tom, give me thy fist, we are friends; you shall be mineingle:[435] I love you; but I pray you letﾕs have no more ofthese ducking devices.[435] Crony, friend._Dog._ Not, if you love me. Dogs love where they are beloved;cherish me, and Iﾕll do anything for thee._Cud._ Well, you shall have jowls and livers; I have butchersto my friends that shall bestow ﾕem: and I will keep crusts andbones for you, if youﾕll be a kind dog, Tom._Dog._ Any thing; Iﾕll help thee to thy love._Cud._ Wilt thou? that promise shall cost me a brown loaf,though I steal it out of my fatherﾕs cupboard: youﾕll eat stolengoods, Tom, will you not?_Dog._ O, best of all; the sweetest bits those._Cud._ You shall not starve, Ningle[436] Tom, believe that: ifyou love fish, Iﾕll help you to maids and soles; Iﾕm acquaintedwith a fishmonger.[436] Abbreviation for ﾒMine ingle,ﾓ as above._Dog._ Maids and soles? O, sweet bits! banqueting stuff those._Cud._ One thing I would request you, ningle, as you haveplayed the knavish cur with me a little, that you would mingleamongst our morris-dancers in the morning. You can dance?_Dog._ Yes, yes, any thing; Iﾕll be there, but unseen to any butthyself. Get thee gone before; fear not my presence. I have workto-night; I serve more masters, more dames than one._Cud._ He can serve Mammon and the devil too._Dog._ It shall concern thee and thy loveﾕs purchase.There is a gallant rival loves the maid,And likely is to have her. Mark what a mischief,Before the morris ends, shall light on him!_Cud._ O, sweet ningle, thy neuf[437] once again; friends mustpart for a time. Farewell, with this remembrance; shalt havebread too when we meet again. If ever there were an honestdevil, ﾕtwill be the Devil of Edmonton,[438] I see. Farewell,Tom; I prithee dog me as soon as thou canst. [_Exit._[437] Or ﾒneif,ﾓ _i.e._ fist.[438] The allusion is to Master Peter Fabel, who, as theprologue to the old comedy says, ﾒwas called, for his sleightsand his magic, ﾒThe merry Devil of Edmonton.ﾓ--_Gifford.__Dog._ Iﾕll not miss thee, and be merry with thee.Those that are joys denied must take delightIn sins and mischiefs; ﾕtis the devilﾕs right.      [_Exit._SCENE II.--_The neighbourhood of Edmonton.__Enter_ FRANK THORNEY _and_ WINNIFRED _in boyﾕs clothes_._Frank._ Prithee no more! those tears give nourishmentTo weeds and briers in me, which shortly willOﾕergrow and top my head; my shame will sitAnd cover all that can be seen of me._Win._ I have not shown this cheek in company;Pardon me now: thus singled with yourself,It calls a thousand sorrows round about,Some going before, and some on either side,But infinite behind; all chained together:Your second adulterous marriage leads;That is the sad eclipse, thﾕ effects must follow,As plagues of shame, spite, scorn, and obloquy._Frank._ Why, hast thou not left one hourﾕs patienceTo add to all the rest? one hour bears usBeyond the reach of all these enemies:Are we not now set forward in the flight,Provided with the dowry of my sin[439]To keep us in some other nation?While we together are, we are at homeIn any place.[439] Frank alludes to the marriage portion which he had justreceived with Susan.--_Gifford.__Win._        ﾕTis foul ill-gotten coin,Far worse than usury or extortion._Frank._                           LetMy father, then, make the restitution,Who forced me to take the bribe: it is his giftAnd patrimony to me; so I receive it.He would not bless, nor look a father on me,Until I satisfied his angry will:When I was sold, I sold myself again--Some knaves have doneﾕt in lands, and I in body--For money, and I have the hire. But, sweet, no more,ﾕTis hazard of discovery, our discourse;And then prevention takes off all our hopes:For only but to take her leave of meMy wife is coming._Win._             Who coming? your wife!_Frank._ No, no; thou art here: the woman--I knewNot how to call her now; but after this dayShe shall be quite forgot and have no nameIn my remembrance. See, see! sheﾕs come. _Enter_ SUSAN.                                         Go leadThe horses to thﾕ hillﾕs top; there Iﾕll meet thee._Sus._ Nay, with your favour let him stay a little;I would part with him too, because he isYour sole companion; and Iﾕll begin with him,Reserving you the last._Frank._                Ay, with all my heart._Sus._ You may hear, ifﾕt please you, sir._Frank._                                   No, ﾕtis not fit:Some rudiments, I conceive, they must be,To overlook my slippery footings: and so--_Sus._ No, indeed, sir._Frank._                Tush, I know it must be so,And it is necessary: on! but be brief.      [_Walks forward.__Win._ What charge soeﾕer you lay upon me, mistress,I shall support it faithfully--being honest--To my best strength._Sus._               Believeﾕt shall be no other.I know you were commended to my husbandBy a noble knight._Win._             O, gods! O, mine eyes!_Sus._ How now! what ailﾕst thou, lad?_Win._ Something hit mine eye,--it makes it water still,--Even as you said ﾒcommended to my husband.ﾓ--Some dor[440] I think it was.--I was, forsooth,Commended to him by Sir Arthur Clarington.[440] Cockchafer, beetle._Sus._ Whose servant once my Thorney was himself.That title, methinks, should make you almost fellows;Or at the least much more than a servant;And I am sure he will respect you so.Your love to him, then, needs no spur from me,And what for my sake you will ever do,ﾕTis fit it should be bought with something moreThan fair entreats; look! hereﾕs a jewel for thee,A pretty wanton label for thine ear;And I would have it hang there, still to whisperThese words to thee, ﾒThou hast my jewel with thee.ﾓIt is but earnest of a larger bounty,When thou returnﾕst with praises of thy service,Which I am confident thou wilt deserve.Why, thou art many now besides thyself:Thou mayst be servant, friend, and wife to him;A good wife is them all. A friend can playThe wife and servantﾕs part, and shift enough;No less the servant can the friend and wife:ﾕTis all but sweet society, good counsel,Interchanged loves, yes, and counsel-keeping._Frank._ Not done yet?_Sus._ Even now, sir._Win._ Mistress, believe my vow; your severe eye,Wereﾕt present to command, your bounteous hand,Were it then by to buy or bribe my service,Shall not make me more dear or near unto himThan I shall voluntary. Iﾕll be all your charge,Servant, friend, wife to him._Sus._                        Wilt thou?Now blessings go with thee forﾕt! courtesiesShall meet thee coming home._Win._                       Pray you say plainly,Mistress, are you jealous of him? if you be,Iﾕll look to him that way too._Sus._                         Sayﾕst thou so?I would thou hadst a womanﾕs bosom now;We have weak thoughts within us. Alas,Thereﾕs nothing so strong in us as suspicion;But I dare not, nay, I will not thinkSo hardly of my Thorney._Win._                   Believe it, mistress,Iﾕll be no pander to him; and if I findAny loose lubric scapes in him, Iﾕll watch him,And at my return protest Iﾕll show you all:He shall hardly offend without my knowledge._Sus._ Thine own diligence is that I press,And not the curious eye over his faults.Farewell: if I should never see thee more,Take it for ever._Frank._ Prithee take that along with thee, [_Handing      his sword to_ WINNIFRED.] and haste theeTo the hillﾕs top; Iﾕll be there instantly._Sus._ No haste, I prithee; slowly as thou canst--    [_Exit_ WINNIFRED.Pray let him obey me now; ﾕtis happilyHis last service to me: my power is eﾕenA-going out of sight._Frank._              Why would you delay?We have no other business now but to part._Sus._ And will not that, sweetheart, ask a long time?Methinks it is the hardest piece of workThat eﾕer I took in hand._Frank._                  Fie, fie! why, look,Iﾕll make it plain and easy to you--farewell!      [_Kisses her.__Sus._ Ah, ﾕlas, Iﾕm not half perfect in it yet;I must have it read oﾕer an hundred times:Pray you take some pains; I confess my dulness._Frank._ [_Aside._] What a thorn this rose grows on! Parting were sweet;But what a trouble ﾕtwill be to obtain it!--Come, again and again, farewell!--[_Kisses her._] Yet wilt return?All questions of my journey, my stay, employment,And revisitation, fully I have answered all;Thereﾕs nothing now behind but--nothing._Sus._                                   AndThat _nothing_ is more hard than anything,Than all the everythings. This request--_Frank._                                 What isﾕt?_Sus._ That I may bring you through one pasture moreUp to yon knot of trees; amongst those shadowsIﾕll vanish from you, they shall teach me how._Frank._ Why, ﾕtis granted; come, walk, then._Sus._                                        Nay, not too fast:They say slow things have best perfection;The gentle shower wets to fertility,The churlish storm may mischief with his bounty;The baser beasts take strength even from the womb,But the lord lionﾕs whelp is feeble long.      [_Exeunt._SCENE III.--_A Field with a clump of trees.__Enter the ~Dog~.__Dog._ Now for an early mischief and a sudden!The mindﾕs about it now; one touch from meSoon sets the body forward._Enter_ FRANK _and_ SUSAN._Frank._                   Your requestIs out; yet will you leave me?_Sus._                        What? so churlishly?Youﾕll make me stay for ever,Rather than part with such a sound from you._Frank._ Why, you almost anger me. Pray you be gone.You have no company, and ﾕtis very early;Some hurt may betide you homewards._Sus._                              Tush! I fear none;To leave you is the greatest hurt I can suffer:Besides, I expect your father and mine ownTo meet me back, or overtake me with you;They began to stir when I came after youI know theyﾕll not be long._Frank._ So! I shall have more trouble,--[_The ~Dog~ rubs      against him_]--thank you for that:[441][_Aside._] Then Iﾕll ease all at once. It is done now;What I neﾕer thought on.--You shall not go back.[441] The dog is of course supposed invisible. Frank thanksSusan for telling him of the threatened arrival of Carter andOld Thorney which would lead to discovery._Sus._ Why, shall I go along with thee? sweet music!_Frank._ No, to a better place._Sus._                          Any place I;Iﾕm there at home where thou pleasest to have me._Frank._ At home? Iﾕll leave you in your last lodging;I must kill you._Sus._           O, fine! youﾕd fright me from you._Frank._ You see I had no purpose; Iﾕm unarmed;ﾕTis this minuteﾕs decree, and it must be:Look, this will serve your turn.      [_Draws a knife.__Sus._                               Iﾕll not turn from it,If you be earnest, sir; yet you may tell meWherefore youﾕll kill me._Frank._                  Because you are a whore._Sus._ Thereﾕs one deep wound already; a whore!ﾕTwas ever further from me than the thoughtOf this black hour; a whore?_Frank._                     Yes, Iﾕll prove it,And you shall confess it. You are my whore.No wife of mine; the word admits no second.I was before wedded to another; have her still.I do not lay the sin unto your charge,ﾕTis all mine own: your marriage was my theft,For I espoused your dowry, and I have it.I did not purpose to have added murder;The devil did not prompt me till this minute:You might have safe returned; now you cannot.You have dogged your own death.      [_Stabs her.__Sus._                          And I deserve it;Iﾕm glad my fate was so intelligent:ﾕTwas some good spiritﾕs motion. Die? O, ﾕtwas time!How many years might I have slept in sin,The sin of my most hatred, too, adultery!_Frank._ Nay, sure, ﾕtwas likely that the most was past;For I meant never to return to youAfter this parting._Sus._              Why, then, I thank you more;You have done lovingly, leaving yourself,That you would thus bestow me on another.Thou art my husband, Death, and I embrace theeWith all the love I have. Forget the stainOf my unwitting sin; and then I comeA crystal virgin to thee: my soulﾕs purityShall with bold wings ascend the doors of Mercy;For Innocence is ever her companion._Frank._ Not yet mortal? I would not linger you,Or leave you a tongue to blab.      [_Stabs her again.__Sus._ Now Heaven reward you neﾕer the worse for me!I did not think that Death had been so sweet,Nor I so apt to love him. I could neﾕer die better,Had I stayed forty years for preparation;For Iﾕm in charity with all the world.Let me for once be thine example, Heaven;Do to this man as I him free forgive,And may he better die and better live.      [_Dies.__Frank._ ﾕTis done; and I am in! Once past our height,We scorn the deepﾕst abyss. This follows now,To heal her wounds by dressing of the weapon.[442]Arms, thighs, hands, any place; we must not fail      [_Wounds himself._Light scratches, giving such deep ones: the best I canTo bind myself to this tree. Nowﾕs the storm,Which if blown oﾕer, many fair days may follow.[442] An allusion to an old superstition in which the idea wasthat wounds were healed by the turning of the assailantﾕs weaponagainst himself so as to cover it with his blood.[_Binds himself to a tree; the ~Dog~ ties him behind and exit._So, so, Iﾕm fast; I did not think I couldHave done so well behind me. How prosperousAnd effectual mischief sometimes is!--[_Aloud_] Help! help!Murder, murder, murder!_Enter_ CARTER _and_ OLD THORNEY._Car._ Ha! whom tolls the bell for?_Frank._                            O, O!_O. Thor._                                Ah me!The cause appears too soon; my child, my son!_Car._ Susan, girl, child! not speak to thy father? ha!_Frank._ O, lend me some assistance to oﾕertakeThis hapless woman._O. Thor._          Letﾕs oﾕertake the murderers.Speak whilst thou canst, anon may be too late;I fear thou hast deathﾕs mark upon thee too._Frank._ I know them both; yet such an oath is passedAs pulls damnation up if it be broke.I dare not name ﾕem: think what forced men do._O. Thor._ Keep oath with murderers! that were a conscienceTo hold the devil in._Frank._              Nay, sir, I can describe ﾕem,Shall show them as familiar as their names:The taller of the two at this time wearsHis satin doublet white, but crimson-lined,Hose of black satin, cloak of scarlet--_O. Thor._                              Warbeck,Warbeck, Warbeck!--do you list to this, sir?_Car._ Yes, yes, I listen you; hereﾕs nothing to be heard._Frank._ Thﾕ otherﾕs cloak branched[443] velvet, black,velvet-lined his suit.[443] _i.e._ Adorned with tufts, or tassels, dependent from theshoulders.--_Gifford.__O. Thor._ I have ﾕem already; Somerton, Somerton!Binal revenge all this. Come, sir, the first workIs to pursue the murderers, when we haveRemoved these mangled bodies hence._Car._ Sir, take that carcass there, and give me this.I will not own her now; sheﾕs none of mine.Bob me off with a dumb-show! no, Iﾕll have life.This is my son too, and while thereﾕs life in him,ﾕTis half mine; take you half that silence forﾕt.--When I speak I look to be spoken to:Forgetful slut!_O. Thor._      Alas, what grief may do now!Look, sir, Iﾕll take this load of sorrow with me._Car._ Ay, do, and Iﾕll have this. [_Exit_ OLD THORNEY_with_ SUSAN _in his arms_.] How do you, sir?_Frank._ O, very ill, sir._Car._ Yes,I think so; but ﾕtis well you can speak yet:Thereﾕs no music but in sound; sound it must be.I have not wept these twenty years before,And that I guess was ere that girl was born;Yet now methinks, if I but knew the way,My heartﾕs so full, I could weep night and day.      [_Exit with_ FRANK.SCENE IV.--_Before_ SIR ARTHUR CLARINGTONﾕS _House_._Enter_ SIR ARTHUR CLARINGTON, WARBECK, _and_ SOMERTON._Sir Arth._ Come, gentlemen, we must all help to graceThe nimble-footed youth of Edmonton,That are so kind to call us up to-dayWith an high morris._War._ I could wish it for the best, it were the worst now.Absurdityﾕs in my opinion ever the best dancer in a morris._Som._ I could rather sleep than see ﾕem._Sir Arth._ Not well, sir?_Som._ ﾕFaith, not ever thus leaden: yet I know no cause forﾕt._War._ Now am I beyond mine own condition highly disposed tomirth._Sir Arth._ Well, you may have yet a morris to help both;To strike you in a dump, and make him merry._Enter_ SAWGUT _with the ~Morris-dancers~, &c.__Saw._ Come, will you set yourselves in morris-ray?[444] theforebell, second-bell, tenor, and great-bell; Maid Marian[445]for the same bell. But whereﾕs the weathercock now? theHobby-horse?[444] Array.[445] Maid Marian was always a prominent figure in themorris-dance. Robin Hood, Friar Tuck, and other characters werealso added according to the humour of the dancers._1st Cl._ Is not Banks come yet? What a spite ﾕtis!_Sir Arth._ When set you forward, gentlemen?_1st Cl._ We stay but for the Hobby-horse, sir; all our footmenare ready._Som._ ﾕTis marvel your horse should be behind your foot._2nd Cl._ Yes, sir, he goes further about; we can come in at thewicket, but the broad gate must be opened for him._Enter_ CUDDY BANKS _with the Hobby-horse, followed bythe ~Dog~.__Sit Arth._ O, we stayed for you, sir._Cud._ Only my horse wanted a shoe, sir; but we shall make youamends ere we part._Sir Arth._ Ay? well said; make ﾕem drink ere they begin. _Enter ~Servants~ with beer.__Cud._ A bowl, I prithee, and a little for my horse; heﾕllmount the better. Nay, give me: I must drink to him, heﾕll notpledge else. [_Drinks._] Here, Hobby [_Holds the bowl to theHobby-horse._]--I pray you: no? not drink! You see, gentlemen,we can but bring our horse to the water; he may choose whetherheﾕll drink or no. [_Drinks again.__Som._ A good moral made plain by history._1st Cl._ Strike up, Father Sawgut, strike up._Saw._ Eﾕen when you will, children. [CUDDY _mountsthe Hobby_.]--Now in the name of--the best foot forward![_Endeavours to play, but the fiddle gives no sound._]--How now!not a word in thy guts? I think, children, my instrument hascaught cold on the sudden._Cud._ [_Aside._] My ningleﾕs knavery; black Tomﾕs doing._All the Clowns._ Why, what mean you, Father Sawgut?_Cud._ Why, what would you have him do? you hear his fiddle isspeechless._Saw._ Iﾕll lay mine ear to my instrument that my poor fiddle isbewitched. I played ﾒThe Flowers in Mayﾓ eﾕen now, as sweet as aviolet; now ﾕtwill not go against the hair: you see I can makeno more music than a beetle of a cow-turd._Cud._ Let me see, Father Sawgut [_Takes the fiddle_]; say onceyou had a brave hobby-horse that you were beholding to. Iﾕllplay and dance too.--Ningle, away with it. [_Gives it to the~Dog~, who plays the morris.__All the Clowns._ Ay, marry, sir! [_They dance.__Enter a ~Constable~ and ~Officers~.__Con._ Away with jollity! ﾕtis too sad an hour.--Sir Arthur Clarington, your own assistance,In the kingﾕs name, I charge, for apprehensionOf these two murderers, Warbeck and Somerton._Sir Arth._ Ha! flat murderers?_Som._ Ha, ha, ha! this has awakened my melancholy._War._ And struck my mirth down flat.--Murderers?_Con._ The accusationﾕs flat against you, gentlemen.--Sir, you may be satisfied with this. [_Shows his warrant._]--I hope youﾕll quietly obey my power;ﾕTwill make your cause the fairer._Som. and War._ O, with all our hearts, sir._Cud._ Thereﾕs my rival taken up for hangmanﾕs meat; Tom toldme he was about a piece of villany.--Mates and morris-men, yousee hereﾕs no longer piping, no longer dancing; this news ofmurder has slain the morris. You that go the footway, fare yewell; I am for a gallop.--Come, ningle. [_Canters off with theHobby-horse and the ~Dog~.__Saw._ [_Strikes his fiddle, which sounds as before._] Ay? nay,an my fiddle be come to himself again, I care not. I think thedevil has been abroad amongst us to-day; Iﾕll keep thee out ofthy fit now, if I can. [_Exit with the ~Morris-dancers~.__Sir Arth._ These things are full of horror, full of pity.But if this time be constant to the proof,The guilt of both these gentlemen I dare takeOn mine own danger; yet, howsoever, sir,Your power must be obeyed._War._                     O, most willingly, sir.ﾕTis a most sweet affliction; I could not meetA joy in the best shape with better will:Come, fear not, sir; nor judge nor evidenceCan bind him oﾕer whoﾕs freed by conscience._Som._ Mine stands so upright to the middle zoneIt takes no shadow toﾕt, it goes alone.      [_Exeunt._ACT THE FOURTH.SCENE I.--_Edmonton. The Street.__Enter_ OLD BANKS _and several ~Countrymen~._Old Banks. My horse this morning runs most piteously of theglanders, whose nose yesternight was as clean as any manﾕs herenow coming from the barberﾕs; and this, Iﾕll take my deathuponﾕt, is long of this jadish witch Mother Sawyer._1st Coun._ I took my wife and a serving-man in our town ofEdmonton thrashing in my barn together such corn as countrywenches carry to market; and examining my polecat why she didso, she swore in her conscience she was bewitched: and whatwitch have we about us but Mother Sawyer?_2nd Coun._ Rid the town of her, else all our wives will donothing else but dance about other country maypoles._3rd Coun._ Our cattle fall, our wives fall, our daughters fall,and maid-servants fall; and we ourselves shall not be able tostand, if this beast be suffered to graze amongst us._Enter_ HAMLUC _with thatch and a lighted link.__Ham._ Burn the witch, the witch, the witch, the witch!_Countrymen._ What hast got there?_Ham._ A handful of thatch plucked off a hovel of hers; andthey say, when ﾕtis burning, if she be a witch, sheﾕll comerunning in._O. Banks._ Fire it, fire it! Iﾕll stand between thee and homefor any danger. [HAM. _sets fire to the thatch.__Enter_ MOTHER SAWYER _running.__M. Saw._ Diseases, plagues, the curse of an old womanFollow and fall upon you!_Countrymen._ Are you come, you old trot?_O. Banks._ You hot whore, must we fetch you with fire in yourtail?_1st Coun._ This thatch is as good as a jury to prove she is awitch._Countrymen._ Out, witch! beat her, kick her, set fire on her!_M. Saw._ Shall I be murdered by a bed of serpents? Help, help!_Enter_ SIR ARTHUR CLARINGTON _and a ~Justice~.__Countrymen._ Hang her, beat her, kill her!_Just._ How now! forbear this violence._M. Saw._ A crew of villains, a knot of bloody hangmen,Set to torment me, I know not why._Just._ Alas, neighbour Banks, are you a ringleader in mischief?fie! to abuse an aged woman._O. Banks._ Woman? a she hell-cat, a witch! To prove her one, weno sooner set fire on the thatch of her house, but in she camerunning as if the devil had sent her in a barrel of gunpowder;which trick as surely proves her a witch as the pox in asnuffling nose is a sign a man is a whore-master._Just._ Come, come: firing her thatch? ridiculous!Take heed, sirs, what you do; unless your proofsCome better armed, instead of turning herInto a witch, youﾕll prove yourselves stark fools._Countrymen._ Fools?_Just._ Arrant fools._O. Banks._ Pray, Master Justice What-do-you-call-ﾕem, hearme but in one thing: this grumbling devil owes me I know nogood-will ever since I fell out with her._M. Saw._ And breakﾕdst my back with beating me._O. Banks._ Iﾕll break it worse._M. Saw._ Wilt thou?_Just._ You must not threaten her; ﾕtis against law: Go on._O. Banks._ So, sir, ever since, having a dun cow tied up inmy back-side,[446] let me go thither, or but cast mine eye ather, and if I should be hanged I cannot choose, though it be tentimes in an hour, but run to the cow, and taking up her tail,kiss--saving your worshipﾕs reverence--my cow behind, that thewhole town of Edmonton has been ready to bepiss themselves withlaughing me to scorn.[446] An outbuilding or yard in the rear of a house._Just._ And this is long of her?_O. Banks._ Who the devil else? for is any man such an ass to besuch a baby, if he were not bewitched?_Sir Arth._ Nay, if she be a witch, and the harms she does endin such sports, she may scape burning._Just._ Go, go: pray, vex her not; she is a subject,And you must not be judges of the lawTo strike her as you please._Countrymen._ No, no, weﾕll find cudgel enough to strike her._O. Banks._ Ay; no lips to kiss but my cowﾕs--!_M. Saw._ Rots and foul maladies eat up thee and thine![_Exeunt_ OLD BANKS _and ~Countrymen~.__Just._ Hereﾕs none now, Mother Sawyer, but this gentleman,Myself, and you: let us to some mild questions;Have you mild answers; tell us honestlyAnd with a free confession--weﾕll do our bestTo wean you from it--are you a witch, or no?_M. Saw._ I am none._Just._              Be not so furious._M. Saw._                               I am none.None but base curs so bark at me; Iﾕm none:Or would I were! if every poor old womanBe trod on thus by slaves, reviled, kicked, beaten,As I am daily, she to be revengedHad need turn witch._Sir Arth._          And you to be revengedHave sold your soul to thﾕ devil._M. Saw._                         Keep thine own from him._Just._ You are too saucy and too bitter._M. Saw._                                 Saucy?By what commission can he send my soulOn the devilﾕs errand more than I can his?Is he a landlord of my soul, to thrust it,When he list, out of door?_Just._                    Know whom you speak to._M. Saw._ A man; perhaps no man. Men in gay clothes,Whose backs are laden with titles and with honours,Are within far more crook重 than I am,And, if I be a witch, more witch-like._Sir Arth._ Youﾕre a base hell-hound.--And now, sir, let me tell you, far and nearSheﾕs bruited for a woman that maintainsA spirit that sucks her._M. Saw._                I defy thee._Sir Arth._                           Go, go:I can, if need be, bring an hundred voices,Eﾕen here in Edmonton, that shall loud proclaimThee for a secret and pernicious witch._M. Saw._ Ha, ha!_Just._           Do you laugh? why laugh you?_M. Saw._                                      At my name,The brave name this knight gives me--witch._Just._ Is the name of witch so pleasing to thine ear?_Sir Arth._ Pray, sir, give way, and let her tongue gallop on._M. Saw._ A witch! who is not?Hold not that universal name in scorn, then.What are your painted things in princesﾕ courts,Upon whose eyelids lust sits, blowing firesTo burn menﾕs souls in sensual hot desires,Upon whose naked paps a lecherﾕs thoughtActs sin in fouler shapes than can be wrought?_Just._ But those work not as you do._M. Saw._                             No, but far worseThese by enchantments can whole lordships changeTo trunks of rich attire, turn ploughs and teamsTo Flanders mares and coaches, and huge trainsOf servitors to a French butterfly.Have you not city-witches who can turnTheir husbandsﾕ wares, whole standing shops of wares,To sumptuous tables, gardens of stolen sin;In one year wasting what scarce twenty win?Are not these witches?_Just._                Yes, yes; but the lawCasts not an eye on these._M. Saw._                  Why, then, on me,Or any lean old beldam? Reverence onceHad wont to wait on age; now an old woman,Ill-favoured grown with years, if she be poor,Must be called bawd or witch. Such so abusedAre the coarse witches; tﾕother are the fine,Spun for the devilﾕs own wearing._Sir Arth._                       And so is thine._M. Saw._ She on whose tongue a whirlwind sits to blowA man out of himself, from his soft pillowTo lean his head on rocks and fighting waves,Is not that scold a witch? The man of lawWhose honeyed hopes the credulous client draw--As bees by tinkling basins--to swarm to himFrom his own hive to work the wax in his;He is no witch, not he!_Sir Arth._             But these men-witchesAre not in trading with hellﾕs merchandise,Like such as you are, that for a word, a look,Denial of a coal of fire, kill men,Children, and cattle._M. Saw._             Tell them, sir, that do so:Am I accused for such an one?_Sir Arth._                   Yes; ﾕtwill be sworn._M. Saw._ Dare any swear I ever tempted maidenWith golden hooks flung at her chastityTo come and lose her honour; and being lost,To pay not a denier[447] forﾕt? Some slaves have done it.Men-witches can, without the fangs of lawDrawing once one drop of blood, put counterfeit piecesAway for true gold.[447] Penny. Lat. _Denarius_._Sir Arth._         By one thing she speaksI know now sheﾕs a witch, and dare no longerHold conference with the fury._Just._                        Letﾕs, then, away.--Old woman, mend thy life; get home and pray.      [_Exeunt_ SIR ARTHUR                                                         _and ~Justice~.__M. Saw._ For his confusion._Enter the ~Dog~._                             My dear Tom-boy, welcome!Iﾕm torn in pieces by a pack of cursClapt all upon me, and for want of thee:Comfort me; thou shall have the teat anon._Dog._ Bow, wow! Iﾕll have it now._M. Saw._                          I am dried upWith cursing and with madness, and have yetNo blood to moisten these sweet lips of thine.Stand on thy hind-legs up--kiss me, my Tommy,And rub away some wrinkles on my browBy making my old ribs to shrug for joyOf thy fine tricks. What hast thou done? letﾕs tickle.Hast thou struck the horse lame as I bid thee?_Dog._                                         Yes;And nipped the sucking child._M. Saw._                     Ho, ho, my dainty,My little pearl! no lady loves her hound,Monkey, or paroquet, as I do thee._Dog._ The maid has been churning butter nine hours; but itshall not come._M. Saw._ Let ﾕem eat cheese and choke._Dog._                                  I had rare sportAmong the clowns iﾕ thﾕ morris._M. Saw._                       I could danceOut of my skin to hear thee. But, my curl-pate,That jade, that foul-tongued whore, Nan Ratcliffe,Who, for a little soap licked by my sow,Struck and almost had lamed it;--did not I charge theeTo pinch that queen to thﾕ heart?_Dog._                            Bow, wow, wow! look here else._Enter_ ANN RATCLIFFE _mad.__Ann._ See, see, see! the man iﾕ thﾕ moon has built a newwindmill; and what running thereﾕs from all quarters of the cityto learn the art of grinding!_M. Saw._ Ho, ho, ho! I thank thee, my sweet mongrel._Ann._ Hoyda! a pox of the devilﾕs false hopper! all the goldenmeal runs into the rich knavesﾕ purses, and the poor havenothing but bran. Hey derry down! are not you Mother Sawyer?_M. Saw._ No, I am a lawyer._Ann._ Art thou? I prithee let me scratch thy face; for thypen has flayed-off a great many menﾕs skins. Youﾕll have bravedoings in the vacation; for knaves and fools are at variance inevery village. Iﾕll sue Mother Sawyer, and her own sow shallgive in evidence against her._M. Saw._ Touch her. [_To the ~Dog~, who rubs against her.__Ann._ O, my ribs are made of a paned hose, and they break![448]Thereﾕs a Lancashire hornpipe in my throat; hark, how it ticklesit, with doodle, doodle, doodle, doodle! Welcome, sergeants!welcome, devil!--hands, hands! hold hands, and dance around,around, around. [_Dancing._[448] Paned hose were made of stripes (panels) ofdifferent-coloured stuff stitched together, and therefore liableto break or be seam-rent. Thus counterpane._Re-enter_ OLD BANKS, _with_ CUDDY,RATCLIFFE, _and ~Countrymen~.__Rat._ Sheﾕs here; alas, my poor wife is here!_O. Banks._ Catch her fast, and have her into some closechamber, do; for sheﾕs, as many wives are, stark mad._Cud._ The witch! Mother Sawyer, the witch, the devil!_Rat._ O, my dear wife! help, sirs! [ANN _is carriedoff by_ RATCLIFFE _and ~Countrymen~.__O. Banks._ You see your work, Mother Bumby.[449][449] Farmer Banks is very familiar with the names of old plays(or rather of the supposed witches who gave names to the plays)._Mother Bombie_ is the title of one of Lylyﾕs comedies, of whichshe is the heroine; as is _Gammer Gurton_ of the farcical drama,_Gammer Gurtonﾕs Needle_, to which Old Banks presently refers._M. Saw._ My work? should she and all you here run mad,Is the work mine?_Cud._ No, on my conscience, she would not hurt a devil of twoyears old._Re-enter_ RATCLIFFE _and ~Countrymen~._How now! whatﾕs become of her?_Rat._ Nothing; sheﾕs become nothing but the miserable trunkof a wretched woman. We were in her hands as reeds in a mightytempest: spite of our strengths away she brake; and nothing inher mouth being heard but ﾒthe devil, the witch, the witch, thedevil!ﾓ she beat out her own brains, and so died._Cud._ Itﾕs any manﾕs case, be he never so wise, to die when hisbrains go a wool-gathering._O. Banks._ Masters, be ruled by me; letﾕs all to ajustice.--Hag, thou hast done this, and thou shalt answer it._M. Saw._ Banks, I defy thee._O. Banks._ Get a warrant first to examine her, then ship herto Newgate; hereﾕs enough, if all her other villanies werepardoned, to burn her for a witch.--You have a spirit, they say,comes to you in the likeness of a dog; we shall see your cur atone time or other: if we do, unless it be the devil himself, heshall go howling to the gaol in one chain, and thou in another._M. Saw._ Be hanged thou in a third, and do thy worst!_Cud._ How, father! you send the poor dumb thing howling to thegaol? he that makes him howl makes me roar._O. Banks._ Why, foolish boy, dost thou know him?_Cud._ No matter if I do or not: heﾕs bailable, I am sure, bylaw;--but if the dogﾕs word will not be taken, mine shall._O. Banks._ Thou bail for a dog!_Cud._ Yes, or a bitch either, being my friend. Iﾕll lie by theheels myself before puppison shall; his dog days are not comeyet, I hope._O. Banks._ What manner of dog is it? didst ever see him?_Cud._ See him? yes, and given him a bone to gnaw twentytimes. The dog is no court-foisting hound that fills his bellyfull by base wagging his tail; neither is it a citizenﾕswater-spaniel,[450] enticing his master to go a-ducking twiceor thrice a week, whilst his wife makes ducks and drakes athome: this is no Paris-garden bandog[451] neither, that keeps abow-wow-wowing to have butchers bring their curs thither; andwhen all comes to all, they run away like sheep: neither isthis the Black Dog of Newgate.[452][450] A breed of dogs, in great request for hunting ducks in theponds at Islington and other outlying regions of London at thisperiod.[451] A fierce kind of mastiff kept to bait bears. Parisgarden, where these brutal sports were regularly exhibited,was situated on the Bankside in Southwark, close to the GlobeTheatre.--_Gifford._[452] There is a tract, in prose and verse, attributed to LukeHatton, entitled _The Black Dog of Newgate_; and we learn fromHensloweﾕs _Diary_ that there was a play by Hathway, Day, Smith,and another poet, with the same title.--_Dyce.__O. Banks._ No, Goodman Son-fool, but the dog of hell-gate._Cud._ I say, Goodman Father-fool, itﾕs a lie._All._ Heﾕs bewitched._Cud._ A gross lie, as big as myself. The devil in St. Dunstanﾕswill as soon drink with this poor cur as with any Temple-barlaundress that washes and wrings lawyers._Dog._ Bow, wow, wow, wow!_All._ O, the dogﾕs here, the dogﾕs here._O. Banks._ It was the voice of a dog._Cud._ The voice of a dog? if that voice were a dogﾕs, whatvoice had my mother? so am I a dog: bow, wow, wow! It was I thatbarked so, father, to make coxcombs of these clowns._O. Banks._ However, weﾕll be coxcombed no longer: away,therefore, to the justice for a warrant; and then, GammerGurton, have at your needle of witchcraft!_M. Saw._ And prick thine own eyes out. Go, peevish fools!    [_Exeunt_                                OLD BANKS, RATCLIFFE, _and ~Countrymen~.__Cud._ Ningle, you had liked to have spoiled all with yourbow-ings. I was glad to have put ﾕem off with one of mydog-tricks on a sudden; I am bewitched, little Cost me-nought,to love thee--a pox,--that morris makes me spit in thymouth.--I dare not stay; farewell, ningle; you whoreson dogﾕsnose!--Farewell, witch! [_Exit.__Dog._ Bow, wow, wow, wow._M. Saw._ Mind him not, he is not worth thy worrying;Run at a fairer game: that foul-mouthed knight,Scurvy Sir Arthur, fly at him, my Tommy,And pluck outﾕs throat._Dog._ No, thereﾕs a dog already biting,--ﾕs conscience._M.

A bed thrust forth,with_ FRANK _in a slumber.__Enter_ KATHERINE._Kath._ Brother, brother! so sound asleep? thatﾕs well._Frank._ [_Waking._] No, not I, sister; he thatﾕs wounded hereAs I am--all my other hurts are bitingsOf a poor flea;--but he that here once bleedsIs maimed incurably._Kath._              My good sweet brother,--For now my sister must grow up in you,--Though her loss strikes you through, and that I feelThe blow as deep, I pray thee be not cruelTo kill me too, by seeing you cast awayIn your own helpless sorrow. Good love, sit up;And if you can give physic to yourself,I shall be well._Frank._         Iﾕll do my best._Kath._                           I thank you;What do you look about for?_Frank._                    Nothing, nothing;But I was thinking, sister,--_Kath._                        Dear heart, what?_Frank._ Who but a fool would thus be bound to a bed,Having this room to walk in?_Kath._                      Why do you talk so?Would you were fast asleep!_Frank._                    No, no; Iﾕm not idle.[453]But hereﾕs my meaning; being robbed as I am,Why should my soul, which married was to hers,Live in divorce, and not fly after her?Why should I not walk hand in hand with Death,To find my love out?[453] _i.e._ Wandering._Kath._              That were well indeed,Your time being come; when Death is sent to call you,No doubt you shall meet her._Frank._                     Why should not IGo without calling?_Kath._             Yes, brother, so you might,Were there no place to go when youﾕre goneBut only this._Frank._       ﾕTroth, sister, thou sayﾕst true;For when a man has been an hundred yearsHard travelling oﾕer the tottering bridge of age,Heﾕs not the thousand part upon his way:All life is but a wandering to find home;When weﾕre gone, weﾕre there. Happy were man,Could here his voyage end; he should not, then,Answer how well or ill he steered his soulBy Heavenﾕs or by Hellﾕs compass; how he put in--Losing blessed goodnessﾕ shore--at such a sin;Nor how lifeﾕs dear provision he has spent,Nor how far he inﾕs navigation wentBeyond commission: this were a fine reign,To do ill and not hear of it again;Yet then were man more wretched than a beast;For, sister, our dead pay is sure the best._Kath._ ﾕTis so, the best or worst; and I wish HeavenTo pay--and so I know it will--that traitor,That devil Somerton--who stood in mine eyeOnce as an angel--home to his deservings:What villain but himself, once loving me,With Warbeckﾕs soul would pawn his own to hellTo be revenged on my poor sister!_Frank._                          Slaves!A pair of merciless slaves! speak no more of them._Kath._ I think this talking hurts you._Frank._ Does me no good, Iﾕm sure;I pay forﾕt everywhere._Kath._                 I have done, then.Eat, if you cannot sleep; you have these two daysNot tasted any food.--Jane, is it ready?_Frank._ Whatﾕs ready? whatﾕs ready?_Kath._ I have made ready a roasted chicken for you:_Enter ~Maid~ with chicken._Sweet, wilt thou eat?_Frank._ A pretty stomach on a sudden; yes.--Thereﾕs one in the house can play upon a lute;Good girl, letﾕs hear him too._Kath._                    You shall, dear brother.      [_Exit ~Maid~._Would I were a musician, you should hearHow I would feast your ear! [_Lute plays within_]--stay mend your pillow,And raise you higher._Frank._              I am up too high,Am I not, sister now?_Kath._               No, no; ﾕtis well.Fall-to, fall-to.--A knife! hereﾕs never a knife.Brother, Iﾕll look out yours.      [_Takes up his vest.__Enter the ~Dog~, shrugging as it were for joy, and dances.__Frank._                     Sister, O, sister,Iﾕm ill upon a sudden, and can eat nothing._Kath._ In very deed you shall: the want of foodMakes you so faint, Ha! [_Sees the bloody knife_]--hereﾕs none      in your pocket;Iﾕll go fetch a knife.      [_Exit hastily.__Frank._               Will you?--ﾕtis well, allﾕs well.FRANK _searches first one pocket, then the other, findsthe knife, and then lies down.--The ~Dog~ runs off.--The spiritof_ SUSAN _comes to the bedﾕs side_; FRANK_stares at it, and then turns to the other side, but the spiritis there too. Meanwhile enter_ WINNIFRED _as a page,and stands sadly at the bedﾕs foot_.--FRANK _affrightedsits up. The spirit vanishes.__Frank._ What art thou?_Win._                  A lost creature._Frank._                                 So am I too.--Win?Ah, my she-page!_Win._           For your sake I put onA shape thatﾕs false; yet do I wear a heartTrue to you as your own._Frank._                 Would mine and thineWere fellows in one house!--Kneel by me here.On this side now! how darﾕst thou come to mock meOn both sides of my bed?_Win._                   When?_Frank._                       But just now:Outface me, stare upon me with strange postures,Turn my soul wild by a face in which were drawnA thousand ghosts leapt newly from their gravesTo pluck me into a winding-sheet!_Win._                            Believe it,I came no nearer to you than yon placeAt your bedﾕs feet; and of the house had leave,Calling myself your horse-boy, in to come,And visit my sick master._Frank._                  Then ﾕtwas my fancy;Some windmill in my brains for want of sleep._Win._ Would I might never sleep, so you could rest!But you have plucked a thunder on your head,Whose noise cannot cease suddenly: why should youDance at the wedding of a second wife,When scarce the music which you heard at mineHad taﾕen a farewell of you? O, this was ill!And they who thus can give both hands awayIn thﾕ end shall want their best limbs._Frank._                                Winnifred,--The chamber-doorﾕs fast?_Win._                   Yes._Frank._                      Sit thee, then, down;And when thouﾕst heard me speak, melt into tears:Yet I, to save those eyes of thine from weeping,Being to write a story of us two.Instead of ink dipped my sad pen in blood.When of thee I took leave, I went abroadOnly for pillage, as a freebooter,What gold soeﾕer I got to make it thine.To please a father I have Heaven displeased;Striving to cast two wedding-rings in one,Through my bad workmanship I now have none;I have lost her and thee._Win._                    I know sheﾕs dead;But you have me still._Frank._               Nay, her this handMurdered; and so I lose thee too._Win._                            O me!_Frank._ Be quiet; for thou my evidence art,Jury, and judge: sit quiet, and Iﾕll tell all._While they are conversing in a low tone, enter at one door_CARTER and KATHERINE, _at the other the ~Dog~,pawing softly at_ FRANK._Kath._ I have run madding up and down to find you,Being laden with the heaviest news that everPoor daughter carried._Car._                 Why? is the boy dead?_Kath._                                      Dead, sir!O, father, we are cozened: you are toldThe murderer sings in prison, and he laughs here.This villain killed my sister see else, see,[_Takes up his vest, and shows the knife to her father, whosecures it._A bloody knife inﾕs pocket!_Car._                      Bless me, patience!_Frank._ [_Seeing them._] The knife, the knife, the knife!_Kath._ What knife?      [_Exit the ~Dog~.__Frank._            To cut my chicken up, my chicken;Be you my carver, father._Car._                    That I will._Kath._ How the devil steels our brows after doing ill!_Frank._ My stomach and my sight are taken from me;All is not well within me._Car._ I believe thee, boy; I that have seen so many moons claptheir horns on other menﾕs foreheads to strike them sick, yetmine to scape and be well; I that never cast away a fee uponurinals, but am as sound as an honest manﾕs conscience when heﾕsdying; I should cry out as thou dost, ﾒAll is not well withinme,ﾓ felt I but the bag of thy imposthumes. Ah, poor villain!ah, my wounded rascal! all my grief is, I have now small hope ofthee._Frank._ Do the surgeons say my wounds are dangerous, then?_Car._ Yes, yes, and thereﾕs no way with thee but one._Frank._ Would he were here to open them!_Car._ Iﾕll go to fetch him; Iﾕll make an holiday to see thee asI wish._Frank._ A wondrous kind old man!_Win._ [_Aside to_ FRANK.]             Your sinﾕs the blackerSo to abuse his goodness.--[_Aloud_] Master, how do you?_Frank._ Pretty well now, boy; I have such odd qualmsCome cross my stomach.--Iﾕll fall-to; boy, cut me--_Win._ [_Aside._] You have cut me, Iﾕm sure;--A leg or wing, sir?_Frank._ No, no, no; a wing--[_Aside._] Would I had wings but to soar up yon tower!But hereﾕs a clog that hinders me._Re-enter_ CARTER, _with ~Servants~ bearing the bodyof_ SUSAN _in a coffin_.Whatﾕs that?_Car._ That! what? O, now I see her; ﾕtis a young wench, mydaughter, sirrah, sick to the death; and hearing thee to be anexcellent rascal for letting blood, she looks out at a casement,and cries, ﾒHelp, help! stay that man! him I must have or none.ﾓ_Frank._ For pityﾕs sake, remove her: see, she staresWith one broad open eye still in my face!_Car._ Thou puttedﾕst both hers out, like a villain as thou art;yet, see! she is willing to lend thee one again to find out themurderer, and thatﾕs thyself._Frank._ Old man, thou liest!_Car._                        So shalt thou--in the gaol.--Run for officers._Kath._           O, thou merciless slave!She was--though yet above ground--in her graveTo me; but thou hast torn it up again--Mine eyes, too much drowned, now must feel more rain._Car._ Fetch officers.[_Exit_ KATHERINE _and ~Servants~ with the body of_SUSAN._Frank._ For whom?_Car._ For thee, sirrah, sirrah! Some knives have foolish posiesupon them, but thine has a villainous one; look! [_Showing thebloody knife._] O, it is enamelled with the heart-blood ofthy hated wife, my belov重 daughter! What sayest thou to thisevidence? isﾕt not sharp? doesﾕt not strike home? Thou canst notanswer honestly and without a trembling heart to this one point,this terrible bloody point._Win._ I beseech you, sir,Strike him no more; you see heﾕs dead already._Car._ O, sir, you held his horses; you are as arrant a rogue ashe: up go you too._Frank._ As youﾕre a man, throw not upon that womanYour loads of tyranny, for she is innocent._Car._ How! how! a woman! Isﾕt grown to a fashion for women inall countries to wear the breeches?_Win._ Iﾕm not as my disguise speaks me, sir, his page,But his first, only wife, his lawful wife._Car._ How! how! more fire iﾕ thﾕ bed-straw![454][454] A proverbial expression for more concealedmischief.--_Gifford.__Win._ The wrongs which singly fell upon your daughterOn me are multiplied; she lost a life,But I an husband, and myself must loseIf you call him to a bar for what he has done._Car._ He has done it, then?_Win._                       Yes, ﾕtis confessed to me._Frank._ Dost thou betray me?_Win._ O, pardon me, dear heart! Iﾕm mad to lose thee,And know not what I speak; but if thou didst,I must arraign this father for two sins,Adultery and murder._Re-enter_ KATHERINE._Kath._              Sir, they are come._Car._ Arraign me for what thou wilt, all Middlesex knows mebetter for an honest man than the middle of a market-place knowsthee for an honest woman.--Rise, sirrah, and don your tacklings;rig yourself for the gallows, or Iﾕll carry thee thither on myback: your trull shall to the gaol go with you: there be as fineNewgate birds as she that can draw him in: pox onﾕs wounds!_Frank._ I have served thee, and my wages now are paid;Yet my worse punishment shall, I hope, be stayed.      [_Exeunt._ACT THE FIFTH.SCENE I.--_The Witchﾕs Cottage.__Enter_ MOTHER SAWYER.Mother Sawyer. Still wronged by every slave, and not a dogBark in his dameﾕs defence? I am called witch,Yet am myself bewitched from doing harm.Have I given up myself to thy black lustThus to be scorned? Not see me in three days!Iﾕm lost without my Tomalin; prithee come,Revenge to me is sweeter far than life;Thou art my raven, on whose coal-black wingsRevenge comes flying to me. O, my best love!I am on fire, even in the midst of ice,Raking my blood up, till my shrunk knees feelThy curled head leaning on them: come, then, my darling;If in the air thou hoverﾕst, fall upon meIn some dark cloud; and as I oft have seenDragons and serpents in the elements,Appear thou now so to me. Art thou iﾕ thﾕ sea?Muster-up all the monsters from the deep,And be the ugliest of them: so that my bulch[455]Show but his swarth cheek to me, let earth cleaveAnd break from hell, I care not! Could I runLike a swift powder-mine beneath the world,Up would I blow it all, to find out thee,Though I lay ruined in it. Not yet come!I must, then, fall to my old prayer:_Sanctibicetur nomen tuum._[455] Literally, a bull-calf, sometimes used, as here, as anexpression of kindness; but generally indicative of familiarityand contempt.--_Gifford._Not yet come! the worrying of wolves, biting of mad dogs, themanges, and the--_Enter the ~Dog~ which is now white.__Dog._ How now! whom art thou cursing?_M. Saw._ Thee!Ha! no, it is my black cur I am cursingFor not attending on me._Dog._                   I am that cur._M. Saw._ Thou liest: hence! come not nigh me._Dog._                                         Baw, waw!_M. Saw._ Why dost thou thus appear to me in white,As if thou wert the ghost of my dear love?_Dog._ I am dogged, and list not to tell thee; yet,--to tormentthee,--my whiteness puts thee in mind of thy winding-sheet._M. Saw._ Am I near death?_Dog._ Yes, if the dog of hell be near thee; when the devilcomes to thee as a lamb, have at thy throat!_M. Saw._ Off, cur!_Dog._ He has the back of a sheep, but the belly of an otter;devours by sea and land. ﾒWhy am I in white?ﾓ didst thou notpray to me?_M. Saw._ Yes, thou dissembling hell-hound!Why now in white more than at other times?_Dog._ Be blasted with the news! whiteness is dayﾕs footboy,a forerunner to light, which shows thy old rivelled face:villanies are stripped naked; the witch must be beaten out ofher cockpit._M. Saw._ Must she? she shall not: thouﾕrt a lying spirit:Why to mine eyes art thou a flag of truce?I am at peace with none; ﾕtis the black colour,Or none, which I fight under: I do not likeThy puritan paleness; glowing furnacesAre far more hot than they which flame outright.If thou my old dog art, go and bite suchAs I shall set thee on._Dog._ I will not._M. Saw._ Iﾕll sell myself to twenty thousand fiendsTo have thee torn in pieces, then._Dog._ Thou canst not; thou art so ripe to fall into hell, thatno more of my kennel will so much as bark at him that hangs thee._M. Saw._ I shall run mad._Dog._ Do so, thy time is come to curse, and rave, and die; theglass of thy sins is full, and it must run out at gallows._M. Saw._ It cannot, ugly cur; Iﾕll confess nothing;And not confessing, who dare come and swearI have bewitched them? Iﾕll not confess one mouthful._Dog._ Choose, and be hanged or burned._M. Saw._ Spite of the devil and thee,Iﾕll muzzle up my tongue from telling tales._Dog._ Spite of thee and the devil, thouﾕlt be condemned._M. Saw._ Yes! when?_Dog._ And ere the executioner catch thee full inﾕs claws,thouﾕlt confess all._M. Saw._ Out, dog!_Dog._              Out, witch! thy trial is at hand:Our prey being had, the devil does laughing stand.      [_Runs aside.__Enter_ OLD BANKS, RATCLIFFE, _and~Countrymen~.__O. Banks._ Sheﾕs here: attach her.-- Witch you must go with us.[_They seize her.__M. Saw._ Whither? to hell?_O. Banks._ No, no, no, old crone; your mittimus shall be madethither, but your own jailors shall receive you.--Away with her!_M. Saw._ My Tommy! my sweet Tom-boy! O, thou dog!Dost thou now fly to thy kennel and forsake me?Plagues and consumptions--      [_She is carried off.__Dog._ Ha, ha, ha, ha!Let not the world witches or devils condemn;They follow us, and then we follow them._Enter_ CUDDY BANKS._Cud._ I would fain meet with mine ningle once more: he has hada claw amongst ﾕem: my rival that loved my wench is like to behanged like an innocent. A kind cur where he takes, but where hetakes not, a dogged rascal; I know the villain loves me. [_The~Dog~ barks._] No! art thou there? [_Seeing the ~Dog~._] thatﾕsTomﾕs voice, but ﾕtis not he; this is a dog of another hair,this. Bark, and not speak to me? not Tom, then; thereﾕs as muchdifference betwixt Tom and this as betwixt white and black._Dog._ Hast thou forgot me?_Cud._ Thatﾕs Tom again.--Prithee, ningle, speak; is thy nameTom?_Dog._ Whilst I served my old Dame Sawyer ﾕtwas; Iﾕm gone fromher now._Cud._ Gone? Away with the witch, then, too! sheﾕll never thriveif thou leavest her; she knows no more how to kill a cow, or ahorse, or a sow, without thee, than she does to kill a goose._Dog._ No, she has done killing now, but must be killed for whatshe has done; sheﾕs shortly to be hanged._Cud._ Is she? in my conscience, if she be, ﾕtis thou hastbrought her to the gallows, Tom._Dog._ Right; I served her to that purpose; ﾕtwas part of mywages._Cud._ This was no honest servantﾕs part, by your leave, Tom.This remember, I pray you, between you and I; I entertained youever as a dog, not as a devil._Dog._ True;And so I used thee doggedly, not devilishly;I have deluded thee for sport to laugh at:The wench thou seekﾕst after thou never spakﾕst with,But a spirit in her form, habit, and likeness.Ha, ha!_Cud._ I do not, then, wonder at the change of your garments, ifyou can enter into shapes of women too._Dog._ Any shape, to blind such silly eyes as thine; but chieflythose coarse creatures, dog, or cat, hare, ferret, frog, toad._Cud._ Louse or flea?_Dog._ Any poor vermin._Cud._ It seems you devils have poor thin souls, that you canbestow yourselves in such small bodies. But, pray you, Tom, onequestion at parting;--I think I shall never see you more;--wheredo you borrow those bodies that are none of your own?--thegarment-shape you may hire at brokerﾕs._Dog._ Why wouldﾕst thou know that, fool? it avails thee not._Cud._ Only for my mindﾕs sake, Tom, and to tell some of myfriends._Dog._ Iﾕll thus much tell thee: thou never art so distantFrom an evil spirit, but that thy oaths,Curses, and blasphemies pull him to thine elbow;Thou never tellﾕst a lie, but that a devilIs within hearing it; thy evil purposesAre ever haunted; but when they come to act,--As thy tongue slandering, bearing false witness,Thy hand stabbing, stealing, cozening, cheating,--Heﾕs then within thee: thou playﾕst, he bets upon thy part;Although thou lose, yet he will gain by thee._Cud._ Ay? then he comes in the shape of a rook?_Dog._ The old cadaver of some self-strangled wretchWe sometimes borrow, and appear human;The carcass of some disease-slain strumpetWe varnish fresh, and wear as her first beauty.Didﾕst never hear? if not, it has been done;An hot luxurious lecher in his twines,When he has thought to clip his dalliance,There has provided been for his embraceA fine hot flaming devil in her place._Cud._ Yes, I am partly a witness to this; but I never couldembrace her; I thank thee for that, Tom. Well, again I thankthee, Tom, for all this counsel; without a fee too! thereﾕs fewlawyers of thy mind now. Certainly, Tom, I begin to pity thee._Dog._ Pity me! for what?_Cud._ Were it not possible for thee to become an honest dogyet?--ﾕTis a base life that you lead, Tom, to serve witches, tokill innocent children, to kill harmless cattle, to stroy[456]corn and fruit, etc.: ﾕtwere better yet to be a butcher and killfor yourself.[456] _i.e._ Destroy._Dog._ Why, these are all my delights, my pleasures, fool._Cud._ Or, Tom, if you could give your mind to ducking,--I knowyou can swim, fetch, and carry,--some shop-keeper in Londonwould take great delight in you, and be a tender master overyou: or if you have a mind to the game either at bull or bear, Ithink I could prefer you to Moll Cutpurse[457].[457] A notorious character of those days, whose real name wasMary Frith. She appears to have excelled in various professions,of which far the most honest and praiseworthy was that ofpicking pockets. By singular good fortune she escaped thegallows, and died, ﾒin a ripe and rotten old age,ﾓ some timebefore the Restoration. Moll is the heroine of _The RoaringGirl_, a lively comedy by Middleton and Dekker, who have treatedher with kindness.--_Gifford.__Dog._ Ha, ha! I should kill all the game,--bulls, bears, dogsand all; not a cub to be left._Cud._ You could do, Tom; but you must play fair; you should bestaved-off else. Or if your stomach did better like to serve insome noblemanﾕs, knightﾕs, or gentlemanﾕs kitchen, if you couldbrook the wheel and turn the spit--your labour could not bemuch--when they have roast meat, thatﾕs but once or twice in theweek at most: here you might lick your own toes very well. Or ifyou could translate yourself into a ladyﾕs arming puppy, thereyou might lick sweet lips, and do many pretty offices; but tocreep under an old witchﾕs coats, and suck like a great puppy!fie uponﾕt!--I have heard beastly things of you, Tom._Dog._ Ha, ha!The worse thou heardﾕst of me the better ﾕtis.Shall I serve thee, fool, at the selfsame rate?_Cud._ No, Iﾕll see thee hanged, thou shalt be damned first! Iknow thy qualities too well, Iﾕll give no suck to such whelps;therefore henceforth I defy thee. Out, and avaunt!_Dog._ Nor will I serve for such a silly soul:I am for greatness now, corrupted greatness;There Iﾕll shug in,[458] and get a noble countenance;[459]Serve some Briarean footcloth-strider,[460]That has an hundred hands to catch at bribes,But not a fingerﾕs nail of charity.Such, like the dragonﾕs tail, shall pull down hundredsTo drop and sink with him:[461] Iﾕll stretch myself,And draw this bulk small as a silver wire,Enter at the least pore tobacco-fumeCan make a breach for:--hence, silly fool!I scorn to prey on such an atom soul.[458] Creep in.[459] Patronage, protection, responsibility.--_Gifford._[460] Footcloths were the ornamental housings or trappings flungover the pads of state-horses. On these the great lawyers thenrode to Westminster Hall, and, as our authors intimate, thegreat courtiers to St. Jamesﾕs. They became common enough inaftertimes.--_Gifford._ Briareus, the hundred-handed giant. Theallusion is obvious.[461] Compare ﾒRevelation.ﾓ ch. xii._Cud._ Come out, come out, you cur! I will beat thee out of thebounds of Edmonton, and to-morrow we go in procession, and afterthou shalt never come in again: if thou goest to London, Iﾕllmake thee go about by Tyburn, stealing in by Thieving Lane. Ifthou canst rub thy shoulder against a lawyerﾕs gown, as thoupassest by Westminster-hall, do; if not, to the stairs amongstthe bandogs, take water, and the Devil go with thee!

The neighbourhood of Tyburn.__Enter ~Justice~_, SIR ARTHUR, SOMERTON, WARBECK, CARTER, _and_KATHERINE._Just._ Sir Arthur, though the bench hath mildly censured yourerrors, yet you have indeed been the instrument that wrought alltheir misfortunes; I would wish you paid down your fine speedilyand willingly._Sir Arth._ Iﾕll need no urging to it._Car._ If you should, ﾕtwere a shame to you; for if I shouldspeak my conscience, you are worthier to be hanged of the two,all things considered; and now make what you can of it: but I amglad these gentlemen are freed._War._ We knew our innocence._Som._                        And therefore feared it not._Kath._ But I am glad that I have you safe. [_A noise within.__Just._ How now! what noise is that?_Car._ Young Frank is going the wrong way. Alas, poor youth! nowI begin to pity him._Enter_ OLD THORNEY _and_ WINNIFRED _weeping_._O.

Thor._                   Daughter, grieve notFor what necessity forceth;Rather resolve to conquer it with patience.--Alas, she faints!_Win._            My griefs are strong upon me;My weakness scarce can bear them.[_Within._] Away with her! hang her, witch!_Enter to execution_ MOTHER SAWYER; _~Officers~ withhalberds, followed by a crowd of ~Country-people~_._Car._ The witch, that instrument of mischief!

Saw._ Who doubts it? but is every devil mine?Would I had one now whom I might commandTo tear you all in pieces? Tom would have doneﾕtBefore he left me._Car._ Thou didst bewitch Ann Ratcliffe to kill herself._M. Saw._ Churl, thou liest; I never did her hurt:Would you were all as near your ends as I am,That gave evidence against me for it!_1st Coun._ Iﾕll be sworn, Master Carter, she bewitched GammerWashbowlﾕs sow to cast her pigs a day before she would havefarrowed: yet they were sent up to London and sold for as goodWestminster dog-pigs at Bartholomew fair as ever great-belliedale-wife longed for._M. Saw._ These dogs will mad me: I was well resolvedTo die in my repentance. Though ﾕtis trueI would live longer if I might, yet sinceI cannot, pray torment me not; my conscienceIs settled as it shall be: all take heedHow they believe the devil; at last heﾕll cheat you._Car._ Thouﾕdst best confess all truly._M. Saw._                               Yet again?Have I scarce breath enough to say my prayers,And would you force me to spend that in bawling?Bear witness, I repent all former evil;There is no damn重 conjuror like the devil._All._ Away with her, away!      [_She is led off.__Enter_ FRANK _to execution, ~Officers~, &c.__O. Thor._ Hereﾕs the sad object which I yet must meetWith hope of comfort, if a repentant endMake him more happy than misfortune wouldSuffer him here to be._Frank._               Good sirs, turn from me:You will revive affliction almost killedWith my continual sorrow._O. Thor._                O, Frank, Frank!Would I had sunk in mine own wants, or diedBut one bare minute ere thy fault was acted!_Frank._ To look upon your sorrows executes meBefore my execution._Win._               Let me pray you, sir--_Frank._ Thou much-wronged woman, I must sigh for thee,As he thatﾕs only loth to leave the worldFor that he leaves thee in it unprovided,Unfriended; and for me to beg a pityFrom any man to thee when I am goneIs more than I can hope; nor, to say truth,Have I deserved it: but there is a paymentBelongs to goodness from the great exchequerAbove; it will not fail thee, Winnifred;Be that thy comfort._O. Thor._           Let it be thine too,Untimely-lost young man._Frank._                 He is not lostWho bears his peace within him: had I spunMy web of life out at full length, and dreamedAway my many years in lusts, in surfeits,Murders of reputations, gallant sinsCommended or approved; then, though I hadDied easily, as great and rich men do,Upon my own bed, not compelled by justice,You might have mournﾕd for me indeed; my miseriesHad been as everlasting as remediless:But now the law hath not arraigned, condemnedWith greater rigour my unhappy factThan I myself have every little sinMy memory can reckon from my childhood:A court hath been kept here, where I am foundGuilty; the difference is, my impartial judgeIs much more gracious than my faultsAre monstrous to be named; yet they are monstrous._O. Thor._ Hereﾕs comfort in this penitence._Win._                                       It speaksHow truly you are reconciled, and quickensMy dying comfort, that was near expiringWith my last breath: now this repentance makes theeAs white as innocence; and my first sin with thee,Since which I knew none like it, by my sorrowIs clearly cancelled. Might our souls togetherClimb to the height of their eternity,And there enjoy what earth denied us, happiness!But since I must survive, and be the monumentOf thy loved memory, I will preserve itWith a religious care, and pay thy ashesA widowﾕs duty, calling that end bestWhich, though it stain the name, makes the soul blest._Frank._ Give me thy hand, poor woman; do not weep.Farewell: thou dost forgive me?_Win._                         ﾕTis my partTo use that language._Frank._              O, that my exampleMight teach the world hereafter what a curseHangs on their heads who rather choose to marryA goodly portion than a dower of virtues!--Are you there, gentlemen? there is not oneAmongst you whom I have not wronged; [_to_ CARTER] you most:I robbed you of a daughter; but she isIn Heaven; and I must suffer for it willingly._Car._ Ay, ay, sheﾕs in Heaven, and I am so glad to see thee sowell prepared to follow her. I forgive thee with all my heart;if thou hadst not had ill counsel, thou wouldst not have done asthou didst; the more shame for them._Som._ Spare your excuse to me, I do conceiveWhat you would speak; I would you could as easilyMake satisfaction to the law as to my wrongs.I am sorry for you._War._              And so am I,And heartily forgive you._Kath._                   I will pray for youFor her sake, who Iﾕm sure did love you dearly._Sir Arth._ Let us part friendly too; I am ashamedOf my part in thy wrongs._Frank._                  You are all merciful,And send me to my grave in peace. Sir Arthur,Heaven send you a new heart!--Lastly, to you, sir;And though I have deserved not to be calledYour son, yet give me leave upon my kneesTo beg a blessing.      [_Kneels.__O. Thor._         Take it; let me wetThy cheeks with the last tears my griefs have left me.O, Frank, Frank, Frank!_Frank._                Let me beseech you, gentlemen,To comfort my old father, keep him with ye;Love this distress重 widow; and as oftenAs you remember what a graceless manI was, remember likewise that these areBoth free, both worthy of a better fateThan such a son or husband as I have been.All help me with your prayers.--On, on; ﾕtis justThat law should purge the guilt of blood and lust.      [_Exit,                                       led off by the ~Officers~.__Car._ Go thy ways; I did not think to have shed one tearfor thee, but thou hast made me water my plants spite of myheart.--Master Thorney, cheer up, man; whilst I can stand byyou, you shall not want help to keep you from falling: we havelost our children, both onﾕs, the wrong way, but we cannot helpit; better or worse, ﾕtis now as ﾕtis._O. Thor._ I thank you, sir; you are more kind than IHave cause to hope or look for._Car._ Master Somerton, is Kate yours or no?_Som._ We are agreed._Kath._ And but my faith is passed, I should fear to be married,husbands are so cruelly unkind. Excuse me that I am thustroubled._Som._ Thou shalt have no cause._Just._ Take comfort, Mistress Winnifred: Sir Arthur,For his abuse to you and to your husband,Is by the bench enjoined to pay you downA thousand marks.[462][462] The mark was worth 13_s._ 4_d.__Sir Arth._          Which I will soon discharge._Win._ Sir, ﾕtis too great a sum to be employedUpon my funeral._Car._ Come, come; if luck had served, Sir Arthur, and everyman had his due, somebody might have tottered ere this, withoutpaying fines, like it as you list.--Come to me, Winnifred; shaltbe welcome.--Make much of her, Kate, I charge you: I do notthink but sheﾕs a good wench, and hath had wrong as well as we.So letﾕs every man home to Edmonton with heavy hearts, yet asmerry as we can, though not as we would._Just._ Join, friends, in sorrow; make of all the best:Harms past may be lamented, not redrest.      [_Exeunt._[Illustration: EPILOGUE.]_Spoken by_ WINNIFRED.I am a widow still, and must not sortA second choice without a good report;Which though some widows find, and few deserve,Yet I dare not presume, but will not swerveFrom modest hopes.

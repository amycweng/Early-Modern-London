Author: Thomas DekkerTitle: _THE HONEST WHORE._IN TWO PARTS._PART THE FIRST._BETWEEN the publication of the first, and of the second, partsof _The Honest Whore_, a quarter of a century passed. The firstpart appeared in 1604, having the sub-title “With the Humoursof the Patient Man, and the Longing Wife.” In 1630 followed thesecond part, in which the sub-title is further expanded:--“Withthe Humours of the Patient Man, the Impatient Wife: the HonestWhore, persuaded by strong arguments to turne Courtesan again:her brave refuting those Arguments.--And lastly, the ComicalPassages of an Italian Bridewell, where the scene ends.” Bothtitle-pages give Dekker’s name alone as author, although from apassage in Henslow’s Diary, we learn that Middleton collaboratedwith him in the play.It is impossible now to decide exactly what Middleton’s sharewas, but it was certainly not inconsiderable. Mr. Bullen pointsout, in his introduction to Middleton’s works, the closeresemblance between the scene where Bellafront prepares for hervisitors, and the first scene in the 3rd Act of Middleton’s_Michaelmas Term_; but this play did not appear until threeyears after the first part of Dekker’s. Still the fact ofMiddleton’s repeating the scene, goes to show that he had somespecial share in it, and certain other scenes in the first partare somewhat reminiscent of his style, as those in Acts I.and III., indicated by Mr. Bullen, where the gallants try toirritate Candido. The second part contains nothing that I shouldbe inclined to allot to Middleton, agreeing in this with Mr.Swinburne, who remarks that it “seems so thoroughly of one pieceand pattern, so apparently the result of one man’s inventionand composition, that without more positive evidence I shouldhesitate to assign a share in it to any colleague of the poetunder whose name it first appeared.” Mr. J. Addington Symondshas conjectured that the work as a whole has “the movement ofone of Middleton’s acknowledged plays,” and it is possible thatthe main direction of the plot may have owed something to hismore restraining dramatic sense of form. However this may be,the essential heart and spirit of the play are Dekker’s beyondall question. Bellafront, Matheo, Friscobaldo, Candido, arecreatures not to be mistaken; and their interplay is managedthroughout in Dekker’s individual manner. The source whencethese, with the rest of the characters and episodes of the play,have been derived, has not been discovered: they were no doubttranscribed from life, and their secret lies hidden probably inDekker’s brain alone.“There is in the second part of _The Honest Whore_, whereBellafront, a reclaimed harlot, recounts some of the miseries ofher profession, a simple picture of honour and shame, contrastedwithout violence, and expressed without immodesty, which isworth all the _strong lines_ against the harlot’s profession,with which both parts of this play are offensively crowded. Asatirist is always to be suspected, who, to make vice odious,dwells upon all its acts and minutest circumstances with asort of relish and retrospective fondness. But so near are theboundaries of panegyric and invective, that a worn-out sinneris sometimes found to make the best declaimer against sin. Thesame high-seasoned descriptions, which in his unregenerate stateserved but to inflame his appetites, in his new province of amoralist will serve him, a little turned, to expose the enormityof those appetites in other men.”--C.

Behold, yon comet shows his head again!Twice hath he thus at cross-turns thrown on usProdigious[119] looks: twice hath he troubledThe waters of our eyes. See, he’s turned wild:--Go on, in God’s name.[119] Portentous._Cas._, _Sin._ On afore there, ho!_Duke._ Kinsmen and friends, take from your manly sidesYour weapons to keep back the desperate boyFrom doing violence to the innocent dead._Hip._ I prithee, dear Matheo----_Matheo._ Come you’re mad!_Hip._ I do arrest thee, murderer! Set down.Villains, set down that sorrow, ’tis all mine._Duke._ I do beseech you all, for my blood’s sakeSend hence your milder spirits, and let wrathJoin in confederacy with your weapons’ points;If he proceed to vex us, let your swordsSeek out his bowels: funeral grief loathes words._Cas., Sin._ Set on._Hip._ Set down the body!_Mat._ O my lord!You’re wrong! i’th’ open street? you see she’s dead._Hip._ I know she is not dead._Duke._ Frantic young man,Wilt thou believe these gentlemen?--Pray speak--Thou dost abuse my child, and mock’st the tearsThat here are shed for her: if to beholdThose roses withered, that set out her cheeks:That pair of stars that gave her body light,Darkened and dim for ever; all those riversThat fed her veins with warm and crimson streamsFrozen and dried up: if these be signs of death,Then is she dead. Thou unreligious youth,Art not ashamed to empty all these eyesOf funeral tears, a debt due to the dead,As mirth is to the living? Sham’st thou notTo have them stare on thee? hark, thou art cursedEven to thy face, by those that scarce can speak._Hip._ My lord----_Duke._ What would’st thou have? Is she not dead?_Hip._ Oh, you ha’ killed her by your cruelty!_Du._ Admit I had, thou kill’st her now again;And art more savage than a barbarous Moor._Hip._ Let me but kiss her pale and bloodless lip._Duke._ O fie, fie, fie._Hip._ Or if not touch her, let me look on her._Mat._ As you regard your honour----_Hip._ Honour? smoke!_Mat._ Or if you loved her living, spare her now._Duke._ Ay, well done, sir, you play the gentleman--Steal hence;--’tis nobly done;--away;--I’ll joinMy force to yours, to stop this violent torment--Pass on.[_Exeunt with hearse, all except the_ DUKE,HIPPOLITO _and_ MATHEO._Hip._ Matheo, thou dost wound me more._Mat._ I give you physic, noble friend, not wounds._Duke._ O, well said, well done, a true gentleman!Alack, I know the sea of lovers’ rageComes rushing with so strong a tide, it beatsAnd bears down all respects of life, of honour,Of friends, of foes! Forget her, gallant youth._Hip._ Forget her?_Duke._ Nay, nay, be but patient;For why death’s hand hath sued a strict divorce’Twixt her and thee: what’s beauty but a corse?What but fair sand-dust are earth’s purest forms?Queen’s bodies are but trunks to put in worms._Mat._ Speak no more sentences, my good lord, but slip hence;you see they are but fits; I’ll rule him, I warrant ye. Ay,so, tread gingerly; your grace is here somewhat too longalready. [_Exit_ DUKE.] S’blood, the jest were now,if, having ta’en some knocks o’ th’ pate already, he shouldget loose again, and like a mad ox, toss my new black cloaksinto the kennel. I must humour his lordship. [_Aside_]. My LordHippolito, is it in your stomach to go to dinner?_Hip._ Where is the body?_Mat._ The body, as the duke spake very wisely, is gone to bewormed._Hip._ I cannot rest; I’ll meet it at next turn:I’ll see how my love looks.      [MATHEO _holds him back_._Mat._ How your love looks? worse than a scare-crow.Wrestle not with me: the great fellow gives the fall for a ducat._Hip._ I shall forget myself._Mat._ Pray, do so, leave yourself behind yourself, and gowhither you will. ’Sfoot, do you long to have base rogues thatmaintain a Saint Anthony’s fire in their noses by nothing buttwopenny ale, make ballads of you? If the duke had but so muchmettle in him, as is in a cobbler’s awl, he would ha’ been avexed thing: he and his train had blown you up, but that theirpowder has taken the wet of cowards: you’ll bleed three pottlesof Alicant,[120] by this light, if you follow ’em, and then weshall have a hole made in a wrong place, to have surgeons rollthee up like a baby in swaddling clouts.[120] A red Spanish wine, made at Alicant._Hip._ What day is to-day, Matheo?_Mat._ Yea marry, this is an easy question: why to-day is--letme see--Thursday._Hip._ Oh! Thursday._Mat._ Here’s a coil for a dead commodity. ’Sfoot, women whenthey are alive are but dead commodities, for you shall have onewoman lie upon many men’s hands._Hip._ She died on Monday then._Mat._ And that’s the most villanous day of all the week to diein: and she was well, and eat a mess of water-gruel on Mondaymorning._Hip._ Ay? it cannot be,Such a bright taper should burn out so soon._Mat._ O yes, my lord. So soon? why, I ha’ known them, that atdinner have been as well, and had so much health, that they wereglad to pledge it, yet before three a’clock have been found deaddrunk._Hip._ On Thursday buried! and on Monday died!Quick haste, byrlady;[121] sure her winding sheetWas laid out ’fore her body; and the wormsThat now must feast with her, were even bespoke,And solemnly invited like strange guests.[121] By our lady._Mat._ Strange feeders they are indeed, my lord, and, like yourjester, or young courtier, will enter upon any man’s trencherwithout bidding._Hip._ Curst be that day for ever that robbed herOf breath, and me, of bliss! henceforth let it standWithin the wizard’s book (the calendar)Marked with a marginal finger, to be chosenBy thieves, by villains, and black murderers,As the best day for them to labour in.If henceforth this adulterous bawdy worldBe got with child with treason, sacrilege,Atheism, rapes, treacherous friendship, perjury,Slander (the beggar’s sin), lies (sin of fools),Or any other damned impieties,On Monday let ’em be deliverèd:I swear to thee, Matheo, by my soul,Hereafter weekly on that day I’ll glueMine eye-lids down, because they shall not gazeOn any female cheek. And being locked upIn my close chamber, there I’ll meditateOn nothing but my Infelice’s end,Or on a dead man’s skull draw out mine own._Mat._ You’ll do all these good works now every Monday, becauseit is so bad: but I hope upon Tuesday morning I shall take youwith a wench._Hip._ If ever, whilst frail blood through my veins run,On woman’s beams I throw affection,Save her that’s dead: or that I loosely flyTo th’ shore of any other wafting eye,Let me not prosper, Heaven! I will be true,Even to her dust and ashes: could her tombStand whilst I lived, so long that it might rot,That should fall down, but she be ne’er forgot._Mat._ If you have this strange monster, honesty, in yourbelly, why so jig-makers[122] and chroniclers shall picksomething out of you; but an I smell not you and a bawdy houseout within these ten days, let my nose be as big as an Englishbag-pudding: I’ll follow your lordship, though it be to theplace aforenamed. [_Exeunt._[122] Ballad-makers.SCENE II.--_Another Street.__Enter_ FUSTIGO _in some fantastic Sea-suit, meeting a ~Porter~_._Fus._ How now, porter, will she come?_Por._ If I may trust a woman, sir, she will come._Fus._ There’s for thy pains [_Gives money_]. Godamercy, ifever I stand in need of a wench that will come with a wetfinger,[123] porter, thou shalt earn my money before anyclarissimo[124] in Milan; yet, so God sa’ me, she’s mine ownsister body and soul, as I am a Christian gentleman; farewell;I’ll ponder till she come: thou hast been no bawd in fetchingthis woman, I assure thee.[123] _i.e._ Readily. Compare _Gull’s Horn Book_, Notts Ed. p.160.[124] Grandee._Por._ No matter if I had, sir, better men than porters arebawds._Fus._ O God, sir, many that have borne offices. But, porter,art sure thou went’st into a true house?_Por._ I think so, for I met with no thieves._Fus._ Nay, but art sure it was my sister, Viola._Por._ I am sure, by all superscriptions, it was the party youciphered._Fus._ Not very tall?_Por._ Nor very low; a middling woman._Fus._ ’Twas she, ’faith, ’twas she, a pretty plump cheek, likemine?_Por._ At a blush a little, very much like you._Fus._ Godso, I would not for a ducat she had kicked up herheels, for I ha’ spent an abomination this voyage, marry, I didit amongst sailors and gentlemen. There’s a little modicum more,porter, for making thee stay [_Gives money_]; farewell, honestporter._Por._ I am in your debt, sir; God preserve you._Fus._ Not so, neither, good porter. [_Exit_ Porter.] God’s lid,yonder she comes. [_Enter_ VIOLA.] Sister Viola, I amglad to see you stirring: it’s news to have me here, is’t not,sister?_Vio._ Yes, trust me; I wondered who should be so bold to sendfor me: you are welcome to Milan, brother._Fus._ Troth, sister, I heard you were married to a very richchuff,[125] and I was very sorry for it, that I had no betterclothes, and that made me send; for you know we Milaners love tostrut upon Spanish leather. And how do all our friends?[125] A contemptuous term for an old man of means._Vio._ Very well; you ha’ travelled enough now, I trow, to sowyour wild oats._Fus._ A pox on ’em! wild oats? I ha’ not an oat to throw ata horse. Troth, sister, I ha’ sowed my oats, and reaped twohundred ducats if I had ’em here. Marry, I must entreat you tolend me some thirty or forty till the ship come: by this hand,I’ll discharge at my day, by this hand._Vio._ These are your old oaths._Fus._ Why, sister, do you think I’ll forswear my hand?_Vio._ Well, well, you shall have them: put yourself into betterfashion, because I must employ you in a serious matter._Fus._ I’ll sweat like a horse if I like the matter._Vio._ You ha’ cast off all your old swaggering humours?_Fus._ I had not sailed a league in that great fishpond, thesea, but I cast up my very gall._Vio._ I am the more sorry, for I must employ a true swaggerer._Fus._ Nay by this iron, sister, they shall find I am powder andtouch-box, if they put fire once into me._Vio._ Then lend me your ears._Fus._ Mine ears are yours, dear sister._Vio._ I am married to a man that has wealth enough, and witenough._Fus._ A linen-draper, I was told, sister._Vio._ Very true, a grave citizen, I want nothing that a wifecan wish from a husband: but here’s the spite, he has not allthe things belonging to a man._Fus._ God’s my life, he’s a very mandrake,[126] or else (Godbless us) one a’ these whiblins,[127] and that’s worse, and thenall the children that he gets lawfully of your body, sister, arebastards by a statute.[126] The superstitions about this plant, its fanciedresemblance to the human figure, led to its being frequentlyalluded to in this way.[127] Query Whimlings--idiots._Vio._ O, you run over me too fast, brother; I have heard itoften said, that he who cannot be angry is no man. I am suremy husband is a man in print, for all things else save only inthis, no tempest can move him._Fus._ ’Slid, would he had been at sea with us! he should ha’been moved, and moved again, for I’ll be sworn, la, our drunkenship reeled like a Dutchman._Vio._ No loss of goods can increase in him a wrinkle, nocrabbed language make his countenance sour, the stubbornness ofno servant shake him; he has no more gall in him than a dove, nomore sting than an ant; musician will he never be, yet I findmuch music in him, but he loves no frets, and is so free fromanger, that many times I am ready to bite off my tongue, becauseit wants that virtue which all women’s tongues have, to angertheir husbands: brother, mine can by no thunder, turn him into asharpness._Fus._ Belike his blood, sister, is well brewed then._Vio._ I protest to thee, Fustigo, I love him mostaffectionately; but I know not--I ha’ such a tickling withinme--such a strange longing; nay, verily I do long._Fus._ Then you’re with child, sister, by all signs and tokens;nay, I am partly a physician, and partly something else. I ha’read Albertus Magnus, and Aristotle’s Problems._Vio._ You’re wide a’ th’ bow hand[128] still, brother: mylongings are not wanton, but wayward: I long to have my patienthusband eat up a whole porcupine, to the intent, the bristlingquills may stick about his lips like a Flemish mustachio, and beshot at me: I shall be leaner the new moon, unless I can makehim horn-mad.[128] Wide of the mark._Fus._ ’Sfoot, half a quarter of an hour does that; make him acuckold._Vio._ Pooh, he would count such a cut no unkindness._Fus._ The honester citizen he; then make him drunk and cut offhis beard._Vio._ Fie, fie, idle, idle! he’s no Frenchman, to fret at theloss of a little scald[129] hair. No, brother, thus it shallbe--you must be secret.[129] Scurfy._Fus._ As your mid-wife, I protest, sister, or a barber-surgeon._Vio._ Repair to the Tortoise here in St. Christopher’s Street;I will send you money; turn yourself into a brave man: insteadof the arms of your mistress, let your sword and your militaryscarf hang about your neck._Fus._ I must have a great horseman’s French feather too, sister._Vio._ O, by any means, to show your light head, else your hatwill sit like a coxcomb: to be brief, you must be in all pointsa most terrible wide-mouthed swaggerer._Fus._ Nay, for swaggering points let me alone._Vio._ Resort then to our shop, and, in my husband’s presence,kiss me, snatch rings, jewels, or any thing, so you give it backagain, brother, in secret._Fus._ By this hand, sister._Vio._ Swear as if you came but new from knighting._Fus._ Nay, I’ll swear after four-hundred a year._Vio._ Swagger worse than a lieutenant among fresh-watersoldiers, call me your love, your ingle,[130] your cousin, orso; but sister at no hand.[130] Bosom friend._Fus._ No, no, it shall be cousin, or rather coz; that’s thegulling word between the citizens’ wives and their mad-capsthat man ’em to the garden; to call you one a’ mine aunts’[131]sister, were as good as call you arrant whore; no, no, let mealone to cousin you rarely.[131] “Aunt” was a cant term both for a prostitute and abawd.--_Dyce.__Vio._ H’as heard I have a brother, but never saw him, thereforeput on a good face._Fus._ The best in Milan, I warrant._Vio._ Take up wares, but pay nothing, rifle my bosom, mypocket, my purse, the boxes for money to dice with; but,brother, you must give all back again in secret._Fus._ By this welkin that here roars I will, or else let menever know what a secret is: why, sister, do you think I’llcony-catch[132] you, when you are my cousin? God’s my life,then I were a stark ass. If I fret not his guts, beg me for afool.[133][132] Cheat.[133] _i.e._ An idiot. The phrase had its origin in thepractice of the crown granting the custody of idiots and theirpossessions to persons who had interest enough to secure theappointments._Vio._ Be circumspect, and do so then. Farewell._Fus._ The Tortoise, sister! I’ll stay there; forty ducats._Vio._ Thither I’ll send.--[_Exit_ FUSTIGO.]--This law can none deny,Women must have their longings, or they die.      [_Exit._SCENE III.--_A Chamber in the Duke’s Palace.__Enter the ~Duke~, ~Doctor~_ BENEDICT, _and two ~Servants~_._Duke._ Give charge that none do enter, lock the      doors--      [_Speaking as he enters._And fellows, what your eyes and ears receive,Upon your lives trust not the gadding airTo carry the least part of it. The glass, the hour-glass!_Doct._ Here, my lord.      [_Brings hour-glass.__Duke._ Ah, ’tis near spent!But, Doctor Benedict, does your art speak truth?Art sure the soporiferous stream will ebb,And leave the crystal banks of her white bodyPure as they were at first, just at the hour?_Doct._ Just at the hour, my lord._Duke._ Uncurtain her:[_A curtain is drawn back and_ INFELICE _discoveredlying on a couch_.Softly!--See, doctor, what a coldish heatSpreads over all her body!_Doct._ Now it works:The vital spirits that by a sleepy charmWere bound up fast, and threw an icy rustOn her exterior parts, now ’gin to break;Trouble her not, my lord._Duke._ Some stools! [_~Servants~ set stools_.] You calledFor music, did you not? Oh ho, it speaks,      [_Music._It speaks! Watch, sirs, her waking, note those sands.Doctor, sit down: A dukedom that should weighMine own down twice, being put into one scale,And that fond[134] desperate boy, Hippolito,Making the weight up, should not at my handsBuy her i’th’other, were her state more lightThan her’s, who makes a dowry up with alms.Doctor, I’ll starve her on the ApennineEre he shall marry her. I must confess,Hippolito is nobly born; a man--Did not mine enemies’ blood boil in his veins--Whom I would court to be my son-in-law;But princes, whose high spleens for empery swell,Are not with easy art made parallel.[134] Foolish._Servants._ She wakes, my lord._Duke._ Look, Doctor Benedict--I charge you on your lives, maintain for truth,What e’er the doctor or myself aver,For you shall bear her hence to Bergamo._Inf._ O God, what fearful dreams!      [_Wakening.__Doct._ Lady._Inf._ Ha!_Duke._ Girl.Why, Infelice, how is’t now, ha, speak?_Inf._ I’m well--what makes this doctor here?--I’m well._Duke._ Thou wert not so even now, sickness’ pale handLaid hold on thee even in the midst of feasting;And when a cup crowned with thy lover’s healthHad touched thy lips, a sensible cold dewStood on thy cheeks, as if that death had weptTo see such beauty alter._Inf._ I rememberI sate at banquet, but felt no such change._Duke._ Thou hast forgot, then, how a messengerCame wildly in, with this unsavory news,That he was dead?_Inf._ What messenger? who’s dead?_Duke._ Hippolito. Alack! wring not thy hands._Inf._ I saw no messenger, heard no such news._Doct._ Trust me you did, sweet lady._Duke._ La, you now!_1st Ser._ Yes, indeed, madam._Duke._ La, you now.--’Tis well, good knaves!_Inf._ You ha’ slain him, and now you’ll murder me._Duke._ Good Infelice, vex not thus thyself,Of this the bad report before did strikeSo coldly to thy heart, that the swift currentsOf life were all frozen up----_Inf._ It is untrue,’Tis most untrue, O most unnatural father!_Duke._ And we had much to do by art’s best cunning,To fetch life back again._Doct._ Most certain, lady._Duke._ Why, la, you now, you’ll not believe me. Friends,Swear we not all? had we not much to do?_Servants._ Yes, indeed, my lord, much._Duke._ Death drew such fearful pictures in thy face,That were Hippolito alive again,I’d kneel and woo the noble gentlemanTo be thy husband: now I sore repentMy sharpness to him, and his family;Nay, do not weep for him; we all must die--Doctor, this place where she so oft hath seenHis lively presence, hurts her, does it not?_Doct._ Doubtless, my lord, it does._Duke._ It does, it does:Therefore, sweet girl, thou shalt to Bergamo._Inf._ Even where you will; in any place there’s woe._Duke._ A coach is ready, Bergamo doth standIn a most wholesome air, sweet walks; there’s deer,Ay, thou shalt hunt and send us venison,Which like some goddess in the Cyprian groves,Thine own fair hand shall strike;--Sirs, you shall teach herTo stand, and how to shoot; ay, she shall hunt:Cast off this sorrow. In, girl, and prepareThis night to ride away to Bergamo._Inf._ O most unhappy maid!      [_Exit.__Duke._ Follow her close.No words that she was buried, on your lives!Or that her ghost walks now after she’s dead;I’ll hang you if you name a funeral._1st Ser._ I’ll speak Greek, my lord, ere I speak that deadlyword._2nd Ser._ And I’ll speak Welsh, which is harder than Greek._Duke._ Away, look to her.--[_Exeunt ~Servants~._]--Doctor Benedict,Did you observe how her complexion alteredUpon his name and death? Oh, would t’were true._Doct._ It may, my lord._Duke._ May! how? I wish his death._Doct._ And you may have your wish; say but the word,And ’tis a strong spell to rip up his grave:I have good knowledge with Hippolito;He calls me friend, I’ll creep into his bosom,And sting him there to death; poison can do’t._Duke._ Perform it; I’ll create thee half mine heir._Doct._ It shall be done, although the fact be foul._Duke._ Greatness hides sin, the guilt upon my soul!      [_Exeunt._SCENE IV.--_A Street.__Enter_ CASTRUCHIO, PIORATTO, _and_ FLUELLO._Cas._ Signor Pioratto, Signor Fluello, shall’s be merry?shall’s play the wags now?_Flu._ Ay, any thing that may beget the child of laughter._Cas._ Truth, I have a pretty sportive conceit new crept into mybrain, will move excellent mirth._Pio._ Let’s ha’t, let’s ha’t; and where shall the scene ofmirth lie?_Cas._ At Signor Candido’s house, the patient man, nay, themonstrous patient man; they say his blood is immoveable, thathe has taken all patience from a man, and all constancy from awoman._Flu._ That makes so many whores now-a-days._Cas._ Ay, and so many knaves too._Pio._ Well, sir._Cas._ To conclude, the report goes, he’s so mild, so affable,so suffering, that nothing indeed can move him: now do butthink what sport it will be to make this fellow, the mirror ofpatience, as angry, as vexed, and as mad as an English cuckold._Flu._ O, ’twere admirable mirth, that: but how will’t be done,signor?_Cas._ Let me alone, I have a trick, a conceit, a thing, adevice will sting him i’faith, if he have but a thimbleful ofblood in’s belly, or a spleen not so big as a tavern token._Pio._ Thou stir him? thou move him? thou anger him? alas, Iknow his approved temper: thou vex him? why he has a patienceabove man’s injuries: thou may’st sooner raise a spleen in anangel, than rough humour in him. Why I’ll give you instancefor it. This wonderfully tempered Signor Candido upon atime invited home to his house certain Neapolitan lords, ofcurious taste, and no mean palates, conjuring his wife, ofall loves,[135] to prepare cheer fitting for such honourabletrencher-men. She--just of a woman’s nature, covetous to try theuttermost of vexation, and thinking at last to get the startof his humour--willingly neglected the preparation, and becameunfurnished, not only of dainty, but of ordinary dishes. He,according to the mildness of his breast, entertained the lords,and with courtly discourse beguiled the time, as much as acitizen might do. To conclude, they were hungry lords, for therecame no meat in; their stomachs were plainly gulled, and theirteeth deluded, and, if anger could have seized a man, there wasmatter enough i’faith to vex any citizen in the world, if hewere not too much made a fool by his wife.[135] _i.e._ For love’s sake._Flu._ Ay, I’ll swear for’t: ’sfoot, had it been my case, Ishould ha’ played mad tricks with my wife and family: first,I would ha’ spitted the men, stewed the maids, and baked themistress, and so served them in._Pio._ Why ’twould ha’ tempted any blood but his,And thou to vex him? thou to anger himWith some poor shallow jest?_Cas._ ’Sblood, Signor Pioratto, you that disparage my conceit,I’ll wage a hundred ducats upon the head on’t, that it moveshim, frets him, and galls him._Pio._ Done, ’tis a lay,[136] join golls[137] on’t: witnessSignor Fluello.[136] Bet.[137] Hands._Cas._ Witness: ’tis done:Come, follow me: the house is not far off,I’ll thrust him from his humour, vex his breast,And win a hundred ducats by one jest.

I’ll be sworn, for we have a curst mistress. [_Aside.__Vio._ You mumble, do you? mumble? I would your master or Icould be a note more angry! for two patient folks in a housespoil all the servants that ever shall come under them._1st Pren._ You patient! ay, so is the devil when he ishorn-mad. [_Aside.__Enter_ CASTRUCHIO, FLUELLO, _and_PIORATTO._Geo._ Gentlemen, what do you lack?[138][138] The shopkeeper’s common cry at this period._1st Pren._ What is’t you buy?_2nd Pren._ See fine hollands, fine cambrics, fine lawns._Geo._ What is’t you lack?_2nd Pren._ What is’t you buy?_Cas._ Where’s Signor Candido, thy master?_Geo._ Faith, signor, he’s a little negotiated, he’ll appearpresently._Cas._ Fellow, let’s see a lawn, a choice one, sirrah._Geo._ The best in all Milan, gentlemen, and this is the piece.I can fit you gentlemen with fine calicoes too for doublets, theonly sweet fashion now, most delicate and courtly, a meek gentlecalico, cut upon two double affable taffetas,--ah, most neat,feat, and unmatchable!_Flu._ A notable voluble-tongued villain._Pio._ I warrant this fellow was never begot without muchprating._Cas._ What, and is this she, sayest thou?_Geo._ Ay, and the purest she that ever you fingered since youwere a gentleman: look how even she is, look how clean she is,ha! as even as the brow of Cynthia, and as clean as your sonsand heirs when they ha’ spent all._Cas._ Pooh, thou talkest--pox on’t, ’tis rough._Geo._ How? is she rough? but if you bid pox on’t, sir, ’twilltake away the roughness presently._Flu._ Ha, signor; has he fitted your French curse?_Geo._ Look you, gentlemen, here’s another, compare them I pray,_compara Virgilium cum Homero_, compare virgins with harlots._Cas._ Pooh, I ha’ seen better, and as you term them, evener andcleaner._Geo._ You may see further for your mind, but trust me, youshall not find better for your body._Enter_ CANDIDO._Cas._ O here he comes, let’s make as though we pass. Come,come, we’ll try in some other shop._Cand._ How now? what’s the matter?_Geo._ The gentlemen find fault with this lawn, fall out withit, and without a cause too._Cand._ Without a cause?And that makes you to let ’em pass away:Ah, may I crave a word with you gentlemen?_Flu._ He calls us._Cas._ --Makes the better for the jest._Cand._ I pray come near, you’re very welcome, gallants.Pray pardon my man’s rudeness, for I fear meH’as talked above a prentice with you. Lawns!      [_Showing lawns._Look you, kind gentlemen, this--no--ay--this:Take this upon my honest-dealing faith,To be a true weave, not too hard, nor slack,But e’en as far from falsehood as from black._Cas._ Well, how do you rate it?_Cand._ Very conscionably, eighteen shillings a yard._Cas._ That’s too dear: how many yards does the whole piececontain, think you?_Cand._ Why, some seventeen yards, I think, or thereabouts.How much would serve your turn, I pray?_Cas._ Why, let me see--would it were better too!_Cand._ Truth, tis the best in Milan at few words._Cas._ Well: let me have then--a whole penny-worth._Cand._ Ha, ha! you’re a merry gentleman._Cas._ A penn’orth I say._Cand._ Of lawn!_Cas._ Of lawn? Ay, of lawn, a penn’orth. ’Sblood, dost nothear? a whole penn’orth, are you deaf?_Cand._ Deaf? no, sir: but I must tell you,Our wares do seldom meet such customers._Cas._ Nay, an you and your lawns be so squeamish, fare you well._Cand._ Pray stay; a word, pray, signor: for what purpose is it,I beseech you?_Cas._ ’Sblood, what’s that to you: I’ll have a penny-worth._Cand._ A penny-worth! why you shall: I’ll serve you presently._2nd Pren._ ’Sfoot, a penny-worth, mistress!_Vio._ A penny-worth! call you these gentlemen?_Cas._ No, no: not there._Cand._ What then, kind gentlemen, what at this corner here?_Cas._ No, nor there neither;I’ll have it just in the middle, or else not._Cand._ Just in the middle!--ha--you shall too: what,--Have you a single penny?_Cas._ Yes, here’s one._Cand._ Lend it me, I pray._Flu._ An excellent followed jest!_Vio._ What will he spoil the lawn now?_Cand._ Patience, good wife._Vio._ Ay, that patience makes a fool of you.--Gentlemen, youmight ha’ found some other citizen to have made a kind gull on,besides my husband._Cand._ Pray, gentlemen, take her to be a woman;Do not regard her language.--O kind soul:Such words will drive away my customers._Vio._ Customers with a murrain! call you these customers?_Cand._ Patience, good wife._Vio._ Pox a’ your patience._Geo._ ’Sfoot, mistress, I warrant these are some cheatingcompanions._Cand._ Look you, gentlemen, there’s your ware, I thank you, Ihave your money here; pray know my shop, pray let me have yourcustom._Vio._ Custom quoth’a._Cand._ Let me take more of your money._Vio._ You had need so._Pio._ Hark in thine ear, thou’st lost an hundred ducats._Cas._ Well, well, I know’t: is’t possible that _homo_Should be nor man, nor woman: not once moved;No not at such an injury, not at all!Sure he’s a pigeon, for he has no gall._Flu._ Come, come, you’re angry though you smother it:You’re vexed i’faith; confess._Cand._ Why, gentlemen,Should you conceit me to be vexed or moved?He has my ware, I have his money for’t,And that’s no argument I’m angry: no:The best logician cannot prove me so._Flu._ Oh, but the hateful name of a penn’orth of lawn,And then cut out i’th middle of the piece:Pah, I guess it by myself, ’twould move a lambWere he a linen-draper, ’twould, i’faith._Cand._ Well, give me leave to answer you for that:We are set here to please all customers,Their humours and their fancies;--offend none:We get by many, if we lose by one.May be his mind stood to no more than that,A penn’orth serves him, and ’mongst trades ’tis found,Deny a penn’orth, it may cross a pound.Oh, he that means to thrive, with patient eyeMust please the devil if he come to buy!_Flu._ O wondrous man, patient ’bove wrong or woe,How blessed were men, if women could be so!_Cand._ And to express how well my breast is pleased,And satisfied in all:--George fill a beaker.      [_Exit_ GEORGE.I’ll drink unto that gentleman, who latelyBestowed his money with me._Vio._ God’s my life,We shall have all our gains drunk out in beakers,To make amends for pennyworths of lawn!_Re-enter_ GEORGE _with beaker_._Cand._ Here wife, begin you to the gentleman._Vio._ I begin to him! [_Spills the wine.__Cand._ George, fill’t up again:’Twas my fault, my hand shook.      [_Exit_ GEORGE._Pio._ How strangely this doth show!A patient man linked with a waspish shrew._Flu._ A silver and gilt beaker: I’ve a trickTo work upon that beaker, sure ’twill fret him;It cannot choose but vex him. [_Aside._] Signor Castruchio,In pity to thee I have a conceit,Will save thy hundred ducats yet; ’twill do’t,And work him to impatience._Cas._ Sweet Fluello, I should be bountiful to that conceit._Flu._ Well, ’tis enough._Re-enter_ GEORGE _with beaker_._Cand._ Here gentlemen to you,I wish your custom, you are exceeding welcome.      [_Drinks.__Cas._ I pledge you, Signor Candido--[_Drinks._]--here you thatmust receive a hundred ducats._Pio._ I’ll pledge them deep, i’faith, Castruchio.--SignorFluello. [_Drinks.__Flu._ Come: play’t off to me;I am your last man._Cand._ George supply the cup. [_Exit_ GEORGE _whoreturns with beaker filled_._Flu._ So, so, good honest George,--Here Signor Candido, all this to you._Cand._ O, you must pardon me, I use it not._Flu._ Will you not pledge me then?_Cand._ Yes, but not that:Great love is shown in little._Flu._ Blurt[139] on your sentences!’Sfoot, you shall pledge me all.[139] An exclamation of contempt, equivalent to “a figfor.”--_Dyce.__Cand._ Indeed I shall not._Flu._ Not pledge me? ’Sblood, I’ll carry away the beaker then._Cand._ The beaker? Oh! that at your pleasure, sir._Flu._ Now by this drink I will.      [_Drinks.__Cas._ Pledge him, he’ll do’t else._Flu._ So: I ha’ done you right on my thumb-nail,What, will you pledge me now?_Cand._ You know me, sir, I am not of that sin._Flu._ Why then farewell:I’ll bear away the beaker by this light._Cand._ That’s as you please; ’tis very good._Flu._ Nay, it doth please me, and as you say, ’tis a very goodone. Farewell Signor Candido._Pio._ Farewell Candido._Cand._ You’re welcome gentlemen._Cas._ Art not moved yet?I think his patience is above our wit.[_Exeunt_ CASTRUCHIO, FLUELLO _carrying offthe beaker, and_ PIORATTO._Geo._ I told you before, mistress, they were all cheaters._Vio._ Why fool! why husband! why madman! I hope you will notlet ’em sneak away so with a silver and gilt beaker, the best inthe house too.--Go, fellows, make hue and cry after them._Cand._ Pray let your tongue lie still, all will be well.--Come hither, George, hie to the constable,And in calm order wish him to attach them;Make no great stir, because they’re gentlemen,And a thing partly done in merriment.’Tis but a size above a jest thou knowest,Therefore pursue it mildly. Go begone,The constable’s hard by, bring him along,--make haste again.                                             [_Exit_ GEORGE._Vio._ O you’re a goodly patient woodcock,[140] are you not now?See what your patience comes to: every one saddles you, andrides you; you’ll be shortly the common stone-horse of Milan: awoman’s well holped up with such a meacock[141]; I had ratherhave a husband that would swaddle[142] me thrice a day, thansuch a one, that will be gulled twice in half-an-hour: Oh, Icould burn all the wares in my shop for anger.[140] Proverbial term for a simpleton.[141] Milksop.[142] Beat._Cand._ Pray wear a peaceful temper; be my wife,That is, be patient; for a wife and husbandShare but one soul between them: this being known,Why should not one soul then agree in one?_Vio._ Hang your agreements! but if my beaker be gone.-- [_Exit.__Re-enter_ CASTRUCHIO, FLUELLO,PIORATTO, _and_ GEORGE._Cand._ Oh, here they come._Geo._ The constable, sir, let ’em come along with me, becausethere should be no wondering: he stays at door._Cas._ Constable, Goodman Abra’m.[143][143] Thieves’ slang for a man who shams madness to gain hisends. Compare Dekker’s _Bellman of London_, Grosart, sc. III.,p. 101._Flu._ Now Signor Candido, ’sblood why do you attach us?_Cas._ ’Sheart! attach us!_Cand._ Nay swear not, gallants,Your oaths may move your souls, but not move me;You have a silver beaker of my wife’s._Flu._ You say not true: ’tis gilt._Cand._ Then you say true;And being gilt, the guilt lies more on you._Cas._ I hope y’are not angry, sir._Cand._ Then you hope right; for I’m not angry._Flu._ No, but a little moved._Cand._ I moved! ’twas you were moved, you were brought hither._Cas._ But you, out of your anger and impatience,Caused us to be attached._Cand._ Nay, you misplace it:Out of my quiet sufferance I did that,And not of any wrath. Had I shown anger,I should have then pursued you with the law,And hunted you to shame, as many worldlingsDo build their anger upon feebler grounds;The more’s the pity; many lose their livesFor scarce so much coin as will hide their palm:Which is most cruel; those have vexèd spiritsThat pursue lives; in this opinion rest,The loss of millions could not move my breast._Flu._ Thou art a blest man, and with peace dost deal,Such a meek spirit can bless a commonweal._Cand._ Gentlemen, now ’tis upon eating-time,Pray part not hence, but dine with me to-day._Cas._ I never heard a carter yet say nayTo such a motion. I’ll not be the first._Pio._ Nor I._Flu._ Nor I._Cand._ The constable shall bear you company.George, call him in: let the world say what it can,Nothing can drive me from a patient man.      [_Exeunt._ACT THE SECOND.SCENE I.--_A Room in_ BELLAFRONT’S _House_._Enter_ ROGER _with a stool, cushion, looking-glass andchafing-dish; these being set down, he pulls out of his pocketa phial with white colour in it, and two boxes, one with white,another with red paint; he places all things in order, and acandle by them, singing the ends of old ballads as he does it.At last_ BELLAFRONT, _as he rubs his cheek with thecolours, whistles within._ROG. Anon, forsooth._Bell._ [_Within._] What are you playing the rogue about?_Rog._ About you, forsooth; I’m drawing up a hole in your whitesilk stocking._Bell._ Is my glass there? and my boxes of complexion?_Rog._ Yes, forsooth: your boxes of complexion are here, Ithink: yes, ’tis here: here’s your two complexions, and if I hadall the four complexions, I should ne’er set a good face upon’t.Some men I see, are born, under hard-favoured planets as well aswomen. Zounds, I look worse now than I did before! and it makesher face glister most damnably. There’s knavery in daubing, Ihold my life; or else this only female pomatum._Enter_ BELLAFRONT _not full ready;[144] she sits down;curls her hair with her bodkin; and colours her lips._[144] _i.e._ Not fully dressed._Bell._ Where’s my ruff and poker,[145] you blockhead?[145] A stick used for plaiting ruffs._Rog._ Your ruff, your poker, are engendering together upon thecupboard of the court, or the court cupboard.[146][146] Sideboard._Bell._ Fetch ’em: is the pox in your hams, you can go nofaster? [_Strikes him.__Rog._ Would the pox were in your fingers, unless you couldleave flinging! catch-- [_Exit.__Bell._ I’ll catch you, you dog, by and by: do you grumble?[_Sings._Cupid is a God, as naked as my nail,I’ll whip him with a rod, if he my true love fail._Re-enter_ ROGER _with ruff and poker_._Rog._ There’s your ruff, shall I poke it?_Bell._ Yes, honest Roger--no, stay; prithee, good boy, holdhere. [_Sings._] [ROGER _holds the glass and candle_.]Down, down, down, down, I fall down and arise,--down--I nevershall arise._Rog._ Troth mistress, then leave the trade if you shall neverrise._Bell._ What trade, Goodman Abra’m?[147][147] See note, _ante_, p. 115._Rog._ Why that of down and arise or the falling trade._Bell._ I’ll fall with you by and by._Rog._ If you do I know who shall smart for’t:Troth, mistress, what do I look like now?_Bell._ Like as you are; a panderly sixpenny rascal._Rog._ I may thank you for that: in faith I look like an oldproverb, “Hold the candle before the devil.”_Bell._ Ud’s life, I’ll stick my knife in your guts an you prateto me so!--What? [_Sings._Well met, pug, the pearl of beauty: umh, umh.How now, Sir Knave? you forget your duty, umh, umh,Marrymuff,[148] sir, are you grown so dainty; fa, la, la, leera, la.Is it you, sir? the worst of twenty, fa, la, la, leera, la.[148] A common ejaculation of contempt.Pox on you, how dost thou hold my glass?_Rog._ Why, as I hold your door: with my fingers._Bell._ Nay, pray thee, sweet honey Roger, hold up handsomely.[_Sings._Pretty wantons warble, &c.We shall ha’ guests to day, I lay my little maidenhead; my noseitches so._Rog._ I said so too last night, when our fleas twinged me._Bell._ So, poke my ruff now, my gown, my gown! have I my fall?where’s my fall, Roger?_Rog._ Your fall, forsooth, is behind. [_Knocking within.__Bell._ God’s my pittikins![149] some fool or other knocks.[149] A corruption of “God’s my pity.”--_Dyce.__Rog._ Shall I open to the fool, mistress?_Bell._ And all these baubles lying thus? Away with itquickly.--Ay, ay, knock, and be damned, whosoever you be!--So:give the fresh salmon line now: let him come ashore. [_Exit_ROGER.] He shall serve for my breakfast, though he goagainst my stomach._Enter_ FLUELLO, CASTRUCHIO, _and_PIORATTO, _with_ ROGER._Flu._ Morrow, coz._Cas._ How does my sweet acquaintance?_Pio._ Save thee, little marmoset: how dost thou, good, prettyrogue?_Bell._ Well, God-a-mercy, good, pretty rascal._Flu._ Roger, some light, I prithee._Rog._ You shall, signor, for we that live here in this vale ofmisery are as dark as hell. [_Exit for a candle.__Cas._ Good tobacco, Fluello?_Flu._ Smell._Pio._ It may be tickling gear: for it plays with my nosealready. [_Re-enter_ ROGER _with candle_._Rog._ Here’s another light angel,[150] signor.[150] A gold coin worth about ten shillings. The play upon theword was one of the commonest puns of the time._Bell._ What? you pied curtal,[151] what’s that you are neighing?[151] A docked horse._Rog._ I say God send us the light of Heaven, or some more angels._Bell._ Go fetch some wine, and drink half of it._Rog._ I must fetch some wine, gentlemen, and drink half of it._Flu._ Here Roger._Cas._ No, let me send, prithee._Flu._ Hold, you cankerworm._Rog._ You shall send both, if you please, signors._Pio._ Stay, what’s best to drink a’ mornings?_Rog._ Hippocras,[152] sir, for my mistress, if I fetch it, ismost dear to her.[152] Spiced and sweetened wine._Flu._ Hippocras? there then, here’s a teston for you, yousnake. [_They give money.__Rog._ Right sir, here’s three shillings and sixpence for apottle[153] and a manchet.[154] [_Exit._[153] Half a gallon.[154] A roll of fine bread._Cas._ Here’s most Herculanean tobacco; ha’ some, acquaintance?_Bell._ Faugh, not I, makes your breath stink like the piss of afox. Acquaintance, where supped you last night?_Cas._ At a place, sweet acquaintance, where your health dancedthe canaries,[155] i’faith: you should ha’ been there.[155] A sprightly dance._Bell._ I there among your punks![156] marry, faugh, hang’em; Iscorn’t: will you never leave sucking of eggs in other folk’shens’ nests?[156] Prostitutes._Cas._ Why, in good troth, if you’ll trust me, acquaintance,there was not one hen at the board; ask Fluello._Flu._ No, faith, coz, none but cocks; Signor Malavella drunk tothee._Bell._ O, a pure beagle; that horse-leech there?_Flu._ And the knight, Sir Oliver Lollio, swore he would bestowa taffeta petticoat on thee, but to break his fast with thee._Bell._ With me? I’ll choke him then, hang him, mole-catcher!it’s the dreamingest snotty-nose._Pio._ Well, many took that Lollio for a fool, but he’s asubtle fool._Bell._ Ay, and he has fellows: of all filthy, dry-fistedknights, I cannot abide that he should touch me._Cas._ Why, wench? is he scabbed?_Bell._ Hang him, he’ll not live to be so honest, nor to thecredit to have scabs about him; his betters have ’em: but I hateto wear out any of his coarse knight-hood, because he’s madelike an alderman’s night-gown, faced all with cony[157] before,and within nothing but fox: this sweet Oliver will eat muttontill he be ready to burst, but the lean-jawed slave will not payfor the scraping of his trencher.[157] Rabbit-skin._Pio._ Plague him; set him beneath the salt, and let him nottouch a bit, till every one has had his full cut._Flu._ Lord Ello, the gentleman-usher, came into us too; marry’twas in our cheese, for he had been to borrow money for hislord, of a citizen._Cas._ What an ass is that lord, to borrow money of a citizen!_Bell._ Nay, God’s my pity, what an ass is that citizen to lendmoney to a lord!_Enter_ MATHEO _and_ HIPPOLITO;HIPPOLITO _saluting the company, as a stranger, walksoff_.[158] ROGER _comes in sadly behind them, with apottle pot, and stands aloof off_.[158] _i.e._ Retires to the background._Mat._ Save you, gallants. Signor Fluello, exceedingly well met,as I may say._Flu._ Signor Matheo, exceedingly well met too, as I may say._Mat._ And how fares my little pretty mistress?_Bell._ Ee’n as my little pretty servant; sees three courtdishes before her, and not one good bit in them:--How now? whythe devil standest thou so? Art in a trance?_Rog._ Yes, forsooth._Bell._ Why dost not fill out their wine?_Rog._ Forsooth, ’tis filled out already: all the wine thatthe signors have bestowed upon you is cast away; a porter ran alittle at me, and so faced me down that I had not a drop._Bell._ I’m accursed to let such a withered artichoke-facedrascal grow under my nose: now you look like an old he-cat,going to the gallows: I’ll be hanged if he ha’ not put up themoney to cony-catch[159] us all.[159] Cheat._Rog._ No, truly, forsooth, ’tis not put up yet._Bell._ How many gentlemen hast thou served thus?_Rog._ None but five hundred, besides prentices and serving-men._Bell._ Dost think I’ll pocket it up at thy hands?_Rog._ Yes, forsooth, I fear you will pocket it up._Bell._ Fie, fie, cut my lace, good servant; I shall ha’ themother[160] presently, I’m so vext at this horse-plumb.[160] Hysterics._Flu._ Plague, not for a scald[161] pottle of wine![161] Paltry._Mat._ Nay, sweet Bellafront, for a little pig’s wash!_Cas._ Here Roger, fetch more. [_Gives money._] A mischance,i’faith, acquaintance._Bell._ Out of my sight, thou ungodly puritanical creature._Rog._ For the t’other pottle? yes, forsooth._Bell._ Spill that too. [_Exit_ ROGER.] What gentlemanis that, servant? your friend?_Mat._ Gods so; a stool, a stool! If you love me mistress,entertain this gentleman respectively,[162] and bid him welcome.[162] Respectfully._Bell._ He’s very welcome,--pray, sir, sit._Hip._ Thanks, lady._Flu._ Count Hippolito, is’t not? Cry you mercy signor; you walkhere all this while, and we not heard you! Let me bestow a stoolupon you, beseech you; you are a stranger here, we know thefashions a’th’ house._Cas._ Please you be here, my lord? [_Offers tobacco.__Hip._ No, good Castruchio._Flu._ You have abandoned the Court, I see, my lord, since thedeath of your mistress; well, she was a delicate piece--Beseechyou, sweet, come let us serve under the colours of youracquaintance still for all that--Please you to meet here at thelodging of my coz, I shall bestow a banquet upon you._Hip._ I never can deserve this kindness, sir.What may this lady be, whom you call coz?_Flu._ Faith, sir, a poor gentlewoman, of passing good carriage;one that has some suits in law, and lies here in an attorney’shouse._Hip._ Is she married?_Flu._ Ha, as all your punks are, a captain’s wife, or so: neversaw her before, my lord?_Hip._ Never, trust me: a goodly creature!_Flu._ By gad, when you know her as we do, you’ll swear she isthe prettiest, kindest, sweetest, most bewitching honest apeunder the pole. A skin, your satin is not more soft, nor lawnwhiter._Hip._ Belike, then, she’s some sale courtesan.[163][163] _i.e._ For sale._Flu._ Troth, as all your best faces are, a good wench._Hip._ Great pity that she’s a good wench._Mat._ Thou shalt ha’, i’faith, mistress.--How now, signors?what, whispering? Did not I lay a wager I should take you,within seven days, in a house of vanity?_Hip._ You did; and, I beshrew your heart, you’ve won._Mat._ How do you like my mistress?_Hip._ Well, for such a mistress; better, if your mistress benot your master--I must break manners, gentlemen, fare you well._Mat._ ’Sfoot, you shall not leave us._Bell._ The gentleman likes not the taste of our company._Flu._, _Cas._, _&c._ Beseech you stay._Hip._ Trust me, my affairs beckon for me; pardon me._Mat._ Will you call for me half an hour hence here?_Hip._ Perhaps I shall._Mat._ Perhaps? faugh! I know you can swear to me you will._Hip._ Since you will press me, on my word, I will. [_Exit.__Bell._ What sullen picture is this, servant?_Mat._ It’s Count Hippolito, the brave count._Pio._ As gallant a spirit as any in Milan, you sweet Jew._Flu._ Oh! he’s a most essential gentleman, coz._Cas._ Did you never hear of Count Hippolito, acquaintance?_Bell._ Marry muff,[164] a’ your counts, and be no more life in’em.[164] See note, _ante_, p. 118._Mat._ He’s so malcontent! sirrah[165] Bellafront--An you behonest gallants, let’s sup together, and have the count withus:--thou shalt sit at the upper end, punk.[166][165] The term sirrah was applied often to women as well as tomen.[166] Prostitute._Bell._ Punk? you soused gurnet!_Mat._ King’s truce: come, I’ll bestow the supper to have himbut laugh._Cas._ He betrays his youth too grossly to that tyrantmelancholy._Mat._ All this is for a woman._Bell._ A woman? some whore! what sweet jewel is’t?_Pio._ Would she heard you!_Flu._ Troth, so would I._Cas._ And I, by Heaven._Bell._ Nay, good servant, what woman?_Mat._ Pah!_Bell._ Prithee, tell me; a buss, and tell me: I warrant he’s anhonest fellow, if he take on thus for a wench: good rogue, who?_Mat._ By th’ Lord I will not, must not, faith’ mistress. Is’t amatch, sirs? this night, at th’ Antelope: ay, for there’s bestwine, and good boys._Flu._, _Cas._, _Pio._ It’s done; at th’ Antelope._Bell._ I cannot be there to night._Mat._ Cannot? by th’ Lord you shall._Bell._ By the Lady I will not: shall!_Flu._ Why, then, put it off till Friday; wu’t come then, coz?_Bell._ Well._Re-enter_ ROGER._Mat._ You’re the waspishest ape. Roger, put your mistress inmind to sup with us on Friday next. You’re best come like amadwoman, without a band, in your waistcoat, and the linings ofyour kirtle outward, like every common hackney that steals outat the back gate of her sweet knight’s lodging._Bell._ Go, go, hang yourself!_Cas._ It’s dinner-time, Matheo; shall’s hence?_All._ Yes, yes.--Farewell, wench._Bell._ Farewell, boys.--[_Exeunt all except_BELLAFRONT _and_ ROGER.]--Roger, what winesent they for?_Rog._ Bastard wine,[167] for if it had been truly begotten, itwould ha’ been ashamed to come in. Here’s six shillings to payfor nursing the bastard.[167] A sweet Spanish wine._Bell._ A company of rooks! O good sweet Roger, run to thepoulter’s, and buy me some fine larks!_Rog._ No woodcocks?[168][168] Simpletons._Bell._ Yes, faith, a couple, if they be not dear._Rog._ I’ll buy but one, there’s one already here. [_Exit.__Enter_ HIPPOLITO._Hip._ Is the gentleman, my friend, departed, mistress?_Bell._ His back is but new turned, sir._Hip._ Fare you well._Bell._ I can direct you to him._Hip._ Can you, pray?_Bell._ If you please, stay, he’ll not be absent long._Hip._ I care not much._Bell._ Pray sit, forsooth._Hip._ I’m hot.       [_Lays aside his sword._If I may use your room, I’ll rather walk._Bell._ At your best pleasure--whew--some rubbers there!_Hip._ Indeed, I’ll none:--indeed I will not: thanks.Pretty fine lodging. I perceive my friendIs old in your acquaintance._Bell._ Troth, sir, he comesAs other gentlemen, to spend spare hoursIf yourself like our roof, such as it is,Your own acquaintance may be as old as his._Hip._ Say I did like; what welcome should I find?_Bell._ Such as my present fortunes can afford._Hip._ But would you let me play Matheo’s part?_Bell._ What part?_Hip._ Why, embrace you: dally with you, kiss:Faith, tell me, will you leave him and love me?_Bell._ I am in bonds to no man, sir._Hip._ Why then,You’re free for any man; if any, me.But I must tell you, lady, were you mine,You should be all mine; I could brook no sharers,I should be covetous, and sweep up all.I should be pleasure’s usurer; faith, I should._Bell._ O fate!_Hip._ Why sigh you, lady? may I know?_Bell._ ’Thas never been my fortune yet to singleOut that one man, whose love could fellow mine,As I have ever wished it: O my stars!Had I but met with one kind gentleman,That would have purchased sin alone to himself,For his own private use, although scarce proper,Indifferent handsome: meetly legged and thighed:And my allowance reasonable, i’faith,According to my body, by my troth,I would have been as true unto his pleasures,Yea, and as loyal to his afternoons,As ever a poor gentlewoman could be._Hip._ This were well now to one but newly fledged,And scarce a day old in this subtle world:’Twere pretty art, good bird-lime, cunning net,But come, come, faith, confess: how many menHave drunk this self-same protestation,From that red ’ticing lip?_Bell._ Indeed, not any._Hip._ _Indeed?_ and blush not!_Bell._ No, in truth, not any._Hip._ Indeed! in truth?--how warily you swear!’Tis well: if ill it be not: yet had IThe ruffian in me, and were drawn before youBut in light colours, I do know indeed,You could not swear _indeed_, but thunder oathsThat should shake Heaven, drown the harmonious spheres,And pierce a soul, that loved her maker’s honourWith horror and amazement._Bell._ Shall I swear?--Will you believe me then?_Hip._ Worst then of all;Our sins by custom, seem at last but small.Were I but o’er your threshold, a next man,And after him a next, and then a fourth,Should have this golden hook, and lascivious bait,Thrown out to the full length. Why let me tell you:I ha’ seen letters sent from that white hand,Tuning such music to Matheo’s ear._Bell._ Matheo! that’s true, but believe it, INo sooner had laid hold upon your presence,But straight mine eye conveyed you to my heart._Hip._ Oh, you cannot feign with me! why, I know, lady,This is the common passion of you all,To hook in a kind gentleman, and thenAbuse his coin, conveying it to your lover,And in the end you show him a French trick,And so you leave him, that a coach may runBetween his legs for breadth._Bell._ Oh, by my soul,Not I! therein I’ll prove an honest whore,In being true to one, and to no more._Hip._ If any be disposed to trust your oath,Let him: I’ll not be he; I know you feignAll that you speak; ay, for a mingled harlotIs true in nothing but in being false.What! shall I teach you how to loath yourself?And mildly too, not without sense or reason._Bell._ I am content; I would feign loath myselfIf you not love me._Hip._ Then if your gracious bloodBe not all wasted, I shall assay to do’t.Lend me your silence, and attention.You have no soul, that makes you weigh so light;Heaven’s treasure bought it:And half-a-crown hath sold it:--for your bodyIs like the common-shore, that still receivesAll the town’s filth. The sin of many menIs within you; and thus much I suppose,That if all your committers stood in rank,They’d make a lane, in which your shame might dwell,And with their spaces reach from hence to hell.Nay, shall I urge it more? there has been knownAs many by one harlot, maimed and dismembered,As would ha’ stuffed an hospital: this I mightApply to you, and perhaps do you right:O you’re as base as any beast that bears,--Your body is e’en hired, and so are theirs.For gold and sparkling jewels, if he can,You’ll let a Jew get you with Christian:Be he a Moor, a Tartar, though his faceLook uglier than a dead man’s skull.Could the devil put on a human shape,If his purse shake out crowns, up then he gets;Whores will be rid to hell with golden bits.So that you’re crueller than Turks, for theySell Christians only, you sell yourselves away.Why, those that love you, hate you: and will term youLiquorish damnation; with themselves half-sunkAfter the sin is laid out, and e’en curseTheir fruitless riot; for what one begetsAnother poisons; lust and murder hit:A tree being often shook, what fruit can knit?_Bell._ O me unhappy!_Hip._ I can vex you more:A harlot is like Dunkirk, true to none,Swallows both English, Spanish, fulsome Dutch,Back-doored Italian, last of all, the French,And he sticks to you, faith, gives you your diet,Brings you acquainted, first with Monsieur DoctorAnd then you know what follows._Bell._ Misery.Rank, stinking, and most loathsome misery._Hip._ Methinks a toad is happier than a whore;That with one poison swells, with thousands moreThe other stocks her veins: harlot? fie, fie!You are the miserablest creatures breathing,The very slaves of nature; mark me else:You put on rich attires, others’ eyes wear them,You eat, but to supply your blood with sin:And this strange curse e’en haunts you to your graves.From fools you get, and spend it upon slaves:Like bears and apes, you’re baited and show tricksFor money; but your bawd the sweetness licks.Indeed, you are their journey-women, and doAll base and damned works they list set you to:So that you ne’er are rich; for do but show me,In present memory, or in ages past,The fairest and most famous courtesan,Whose flesh was dear’st: that raised the price of sin,And held it up; to whose intemperate bosom,Princes, earls, lords, the worst has been a knight,The mean’st a gentleman, have offered upWhole hecatombs of sighs, and rained in showersHandfuls of gold; yet, for all this, at lastDiseases sucked her marrow, then grew so poor,That she has begged e’en at a beggar’s door.And (wherein Heaven has a finger) when this idol,From coast to coast, has leapt on foreign shores,And had more worship than th’outlandish whores:When several nations have gone over her,When for each several city she has seen,Her maidenhead has been new, and been sold dear:Did live well there, and might have died unknown,And undefamed; back comes she to her own,And there both miserably lives and dies,Scorned even of those that once adored her eyes,As if her fatal circled life thus ran,Her pride should end there, where it first began.What do you weep to hear your story read?Nay, if you spoil your cheeks, I’ll read no more._Bell._ O yes, I pray, proceed:Indeed, ’twill do me good to weep, indeed._Hip._ To give those tears a relish, this I add,You’re like the Jews, scattered, in no place certain,Your days are tedious, your hours burdensome:And were’t not for full suppers, midnight revels,Dancing, wine, riotous meetings, which do drown,And bury quite in you all virtuous thoughts,And on your eyelids hang so heavily,They have no power to look so high as Heaven,--You’d sit and muse on nothing but despair,Curse that devil Lust, that so burns up your blood,And in ten thousand shivers break your glassFor his temptation. Say you taste delight,To have a golden gull from rise to set,To mete[169] you in his hot luxurious arms,Yet your nights pay for all: I know you dreamOf warrants, whips, and beadles, and then startAt a door’s windy creak: think every weaselTo be a constable, and every ratA long-tailed officer: Are you now not slaves?Oh, you’ve damnation without pleasure for it!Such is the state of harlots. To conclude:When you are old and can well paint no more,You turn bawd, and are then worse than before:Make use of this: farewell.[169] Measure._Bell._ Oh, I pray, stay._Hip._ I see Matheo comes not: time hath barred me;Would all the harlots in the town had heard me.      [_Exit.__Bell._ Stay yet a little longer! No? quite gone!Curst be that minute--for it was no more,So soon a maid is changed into a whore--Wherein I first fell! be it for ever black!Yet why should sweet Hippolito shun mine eyes?For whose true love I would become pure, honest,Hate the world’s mixtures, and the smiles of gold.Am I not fair? why should he fly me then?Fair creatures are desired, not scorned of men.How many gallants have drunk healths to me,Out of their daggered arms, and thought them blest,Enjoying but mine eyes at prodigal feasts!And does Hippolito detest my love?Oh, sure their heedless lusts but flattered me,I am not pleasing, beautiful, nor young.Hippolito hath spied some ugly blemish,Eclipsing all my beauties: I am foul:Harlot! Ay, that’s the spot that taints my soul.What! has he left his weapon here behind himAnd gone forgetful? O fit instrumentTo let forth all the poison of my flesh!Thy master hates me, ’cause my blood hath ranged:But when ’tis forth, then he’ll believe I’m changed._As she is about to stab herself re-enter_ HIPPOLITO._Hip._ Mad woman, what art doing?_Bell._ Either love me,Or split my heart upon thy rapier’s point:Yet do not neither; for thou then destroy’stThat which I love thee for--thy virtues. Here, here;                        [_Gives sword to_ HIPPOLITO.Th’art crueller, and kill’st me with disdain:To die so, sheds no blood, yet ’tis worse pain.      [_Exit_ HIPPOLITO.Not speak to me! Not bid farewell? a scorn?Hated! this must not be; some means I’ll try.Would all whores were as honest now as I!

See, gentlemen, what you lack; a fine holland, a finecambric: see what you buy._1st Pren._ Holland for shirts, cambric for bands; what is’t youlack?_Fus._ ’Sfoot, I lack ’em all; nay, more, I lack money to buy’em. Let me see, let me look again: mass, this is the shop.[_Aside._] What coz! sweet coz! how dost, i’faith, since lastnight after candlelight? we had good sport, i’faith, had we not?and when shall’s laugh again?_Vio._ When you will, cousin._Fus._ Spoke like a kind Lacedemonian: I see yonder’s thyhusband._Vio._ Ay, there’s the sweet youth, God bless him!_Fus._ And how is’t, cousin? and how, how is’t, thou squall?[170][170] Wench._Vio._ Well, cousin, how fare you?_Fus._ How fare I? for sixpence a-meal, wench, as well as heartcan wish, with calves’ chaldrons,[171] and chitterlings;[172]besides, I have a punk after supper, as good as a roasted apple.[171] Calves’ Fry.[172] Tripe._Cand._ Are you my wife’s cousin?_Fus._ I am, sir; what hast thou to do with that?_Cand._ O, nothing, but you’re welcome._Fus._ The devil’s dung in thy teeth! I’ll be welcome whetherthou wilt or no, I.--What ring’s this, coz? very pretty andfantastical, i’faith! let’s see it._Vio._ Pooh! nay, you wrench my finger._Fus._ I ha’ sworn I’ll ha’t, and I hope you will not let myoaths be cracked in the ring, will you? [_Seizes the ring._] Ihope, sir, you are not malicholly[173] at this, for all yourgreat looks: are you angry?[173] A corruption of the word “melancholy.”_Cand._ Angry? not I, sir, nay if she can partSo easily with her ring, ’tis with my heart._Geo._ Suffer this, sir, and suffer all, a whoreson gull, to--_Cand._ Peace George, when she has reaped what I have sown,She’ll say, one grain tastes better of her own,Than whole sheaves gathered from another’s land:Wit’s never good, till bought at a dear hand._Geo._ But in the mean-time she makes an ass of some body._2nd Pren._ See, see, see, sir, as you turn your back they donothing but kiss._Cand._ No matter, let ’em: when I touch her lip,I shall not feel his kisses, no, nor missAny of her lip: no harm in kissing is.Look to your business, pray, make up your wares._Fus._ Troth, coz, and well remembered, I would thou wouldstgive me five yards of lawn, to make my punk some falling bandsa’ the fashion; three falling one upon another, for that’s thenew edition now: she’s out of linen horribly, too; troth, sh’ asnever a good smock to her back neither, but one that has a greatmany patches in’t, and that I’m fain to wear myself for want ofshift, too: prithee, put me into wholesome napery, and bestowsome clean commodities upon us._Vio._ Reach me those cambrics, and the lawns hither._Cand._ What to do, wife? to lavish out my goods upon a fool?_Fus._ Fool? Snails, eat the fool, or I’ll so batter your crown,that it shall scarce go for five shillings._2nd Pren._ Do you hear, sir? you’re best be quiet, and say afool tells you so._Fus._ Nails, I think so, for thou tellest me._Cand._ Are you angry, sir, because I named the fool?Trust me, you are not wise in my own house,And to my face to play the antic thus:If you needs play the madman, choose a stageOf lesser compass, where few eyes may noteYour action’s error: but if still you miss,As here you do, for one clap, ten will hiss._Fus._ Zounds, cousin, he talks to me, as if I were a scurvytragedian._2nd Pren._ Sirrah George, I ha’ thought upon a device, how tobreak his pate, beat him soundly, and ship him away._Geo._ Do’t._2nd Pren._ I’ll go in, pass through the house, give some ofour fellow-prentices the watch-word when they shall enter; thencome and fetch my master in by a wile, and place one in the hallto hold him in conference, whilst we cudgel the gull out of hiscoxcomb. [_Exit ~2nd Prentice~.__Geo._ Do’t: away, do’t._Vio._ Must I call twice for these cambrics and lawns?_Cand._ Nay see, you anger her, George, prithee despatch._1st Pren._ Two of the choicest pieces are in the warehouse, sir._Cand._ Go fetch them presently._Fus._ Ay, do, make haste, sirrah. [_Exit ~1st Prentice~.__Cand._ Why were you such a stranger all this while, being mywife’s cousin?_Fus._ Stranger? no sir, I’m a natural Milaner born._Cand._ I perceive still it is your natural guise to mistake me,but you are welcome, sir; I much wish your acquaintance._Fus._ My acquaintance? I scorn that, i’faith; I hope myacquaintance goes in chains of gold three and fifty timesdouble:--you know who I mean, coz; the posts of his gate area-painting too.[174][174] In allusion to the painting of a citizen’s gateposts onhis promotion to be sheriff, so as to display official noticesthe better._Re-enter the ~2nd Prentice~.__2nd Pren._ Signor Pandulfo the merchant desires conference withyou._Cand._ Signor Pandulfo? I’ll be with him straight,Attend your mistress and the gentleman.      [_Exit.__Vio._ When do you show those pieces?_Fus._ Ay, when do you show those pieces?_Prentices._ [_Within._] Presently, sir, presently: we are butcharging them._Fus._ Come, sirrah: you flat-cap,[175] where be these whites?[175] A slang term applied to citizens in allusion to their headgear._Re-enter ~1st Prentice~ with pieces.__Geo._ Flat-cap? hark in your ear, sir, you’re a flat fool, anass, a gull, and I’ll thrum[176] you:--do you see this cambric,sir?[176] Beat._Fus._ ’Sfoot coz, a good jest, did you hear him? he told mein my ears, I was a “flat fool, an ass, a gull, and I’ll thrumyou:--do you see this cambric sir?”_Vio._ What, not my men, I hope?_Fus._ No, not your men, but one of your men i’faith._1st Pren._ I pray, sir, come hither, what say you to this?here’s an excellent good one._Fus._ Ay, marry, this likes[177] me well; cut me off somehalf-score yards.[177] Pleases._2nd Pren._ Let your whores cut; you’re an impudent coxcomb;you get none, and yet I’ll thrum you:--a very good cambric, sir._Fus._ Again, again, as God judge me! ’Sfoot, coz, they standthrumming here with me all day, and yet I get nothing._1st Pren._ A word, I pray, sir, you must not be angry.Prentices have hot bloods, young fellows,--what say you to thispiece? Look you, ’tis so delicate, so soft, so even, so fine athread, that a lady may wear it._Fus._ ’Sfoot, I think so, if a knight marry my punk, a ladyshall wear it: cut me off twenty yards: thou’rt an honest lad._1st Pren._ Not without money, gull, and I’ll thrum you too._Prentices._ [_Within._] Gull, we’ll thrum you._Fus._ O Lord, sister, did you not hear something cry thrum?zounds, your men here make a plain ass of me._Vio._ What, to my face so impudent?_Geo._ Ay, in a cause so honest, we’ll not sufferOur master’s goods to vanish moneyless._Vio._ You will not suffer them?_2nd Pren._ No, and you may blush,In going about to vex so mild a breast,As is our master’s._Vio._ Take away those pieces.Cousin, I give them freely._Fus._ Mass, and I’ll take ’em as freely._Geo., 1st and 2nd Pren., and other prentices, rushing in._We’ll make you lay ’em down again more freely. [_They allattack_ FUSTIGO _with their clubs_._Vio._ Help, help! my brother will be murdered._Re-enter_ CANDIDO._Cand._ How now, what coil is here? forbear I say. [_Exeunt allthe ~Prentices~ except the 1st and 2nd.__Geo._ He calls us flat-caps, and abuses us._Cand._ Why, sirs, do such examples flow from me?_Vio._ They’re of your keeping, sir. Alas, poor brother._Fus._ I’faith they ha’ peppered me, sister; look, dost notspin? call you these prentices? I’ll ne’er play at cards morewhen clubs is trump: I have a goodly coxcomb, sister, have I not?_Cand._ Sister and brother? brother to my wife?_Fus._ If you have any skill in heraldry, you may soon knowthat; break but her pate, and you shall see her blood and mineis all one._Cand._ A surgeon! run, a surgeon! [_Exit 1st ~Prentice~._] Whythen wore you that forged name of cousin?_Fus._ Because it’s a common thing to call coz, and ningle[178]now-a-days all the world over.[178] A contraction of “mine ingle,” _i.e._ my favourite orfriend._Cand._ Cousin! A name of much deceit, folly, and sin,For under that common abused word,Many an honest-tempered citizenIs made a monster, and his wife trained outTo foul adulterous action, full of fraud.I may well call that word, a city’s bawd._Fus._ Troth, brother, my sister would needs ha’ me take uponme to gull your patience a little: but it has made doublegules[179] on my coxcomb.[179] The heraldic term for _red_._Vio._ What, playing the woman? blabbing now, you fool?_Cand._ Oh, my wife did but exercise a jest upon your wit._Fus._ ’Sfoot, my wit bleeds for’t, methinks._Cand._ Then let this warning more of sense afford;The name of cousin is a bloody word._Fus._ I’ll ne’er call coz again whilst I live, to have such acoil about it; this should be a coronation day; for my head runsclaret lustily. [_Exit.__Cand._ Go, wish[180] the surgeon to have great respect-- [_Exit~2nd Prentice~._[180] Desire. _Enter an ~Officer~._How now, my friend? what, do they sit to day?_Offi._ Yes, sir, they expect you at the senate-house._Cand._ I thank your pains; I’ll not be last man      there.--      [_Exit ~Officer~._My gown, George, go, my gown. [_Exit_ GEORGE.] A happy land,Where grave men meet each cause to understand;Whose consciences are not cut out in bribesTo gull the poor man’s right; but in even scales,Peize[181] rich and poor, without corruption’s vails.[182][181] Weigh.[182] Perquisites._Re-enter_ GEORGE.Come, where’s the gown?_Geo._ I cannot find the key, sir._Cand._ Request it of your mistress._Vio._ Come not to me for any key;I’ll not be troubled to deliver it._Cand._ Good wife, kind wife, it is a needful trouble, but formy gown!_Vio._ Moths swallow down your gown!You set my teeth on edge with talking on’t._Cand._ Nay, prithee, sweet,--I cannot meet without it,I should have a great fine set on my head._Vio._ Set on your coxcomb; tush, fine me no fines._Cand._ Believe me, sweet, none greets the senate-house,Without his robe of reverence,--that’s his gown._Vio._ Well, then, you’re like to cross that custom once;You get no key, nor gown; and so depart.--This trick will vex him sure, and fret his heart.     [_Aside and Exit.__Cand._ Stay, let me see, I must have some device,--My cloak’s too short: fie, fie, no cloak will do’t;It must be something fashioned like a gown,With my arms out. Oh George, come hither, George:I prithee, lend me thine advice._Geo._ Troth, sir, were’t any but you, they would break openchest._Cand._ O no! break open chest! that’s a thief’s office;Therein you counsel me against my blood:’Twould show impatience that: any meek meansI would be glad to embrace. Mass, I have got it.Go, step up, fetch me down one of the carpets,[183]The saddest-coloured carpet, honest George,Cut thou a hole i’th’ middle for my neck,Two for mine arms.

[_They cut the carpet._’Tis very well; I thank thee: help it on._Geo._ It must come over your head, sir, like a wench’s petticoat._Cand._ Thou’rt in the right, good George; it must indeed.Fetch me a night-cap: for I’ll gird it close,As if my health were queasy: ’twill show wellFor a rude, careless night-gown, will’t not, think’st?_Geo._ Indifferent well, sir, for a night-gown, being girt andpleated._Cand._ Ay, and a night-cap on my head._Geo._ That’s true sir, I’ll run and fetch one, and a staff.[_Exit.__Cand._ For thus they cannot choose but conster[185] it,One that is out of health, takes no delight,Wears his apparel without appetite,And puts on heedless raiment without form.--[185] Construe._Re-enter_ GEORGE, _with nightcap and staff_.So, so, kind George, [_Puts on nightcap._]--be secret now: and,prithee, do not laugh at me till I’m out of sight._Geo._ I laugh? not I, sir._Cand._ Now to the senate-house:Methinks, I’d rather wear, without a frown,A patient carpet, than an angry gown.

Barn is a corruption ofbaron, and in law a wife is said to be under covert baron, beingsheltered by marriage under her husband.--_Dyce.__Vio._ No wrong at all: here take the key, be gone:If any vex him, this: if not this, none.

F._ O Roger, Roger, where’s your mistress, where’s yourmistress? there’s the finest, neatest gentleman at my house, butnewly come over: Oh, where is she, where is she, where is she?_Rog._ My mistress is abroad, but not amongst ’em: my mistressis not the whore now that you take her for._Mis. F._ How? is she not a whore? do you go about to take awayher good name, Roger? you are a fine pander indeed._Rog._ I tell you, Madonna Fingerlock, I am not sad for nothing,I ha’ not eaten one good meal this three and thirty days: I hadwont to get sixteen pence by fetching a pottle of hippocras;but now those days are past. We had as good doings, MadonnaFingerlock, she within doors, and I without, as any poor youngcouple in Milan._Mis. F._ God’s my life, and is she changed now?_Rog._ I ha’ lost by her squeamishness, more than would havebuilded twelve bawdy-houses._Mis. F._ And had she no time to turn honest but now? what avile woman is this! twenty pound a-night, I’ll be sworn, Roger,in good gold and no silver: why here was a time! if she shouldha’ picked out a time, it could not be better: gold enoughstirring; choice of men, choice of hair, choice of beards,choice of legs, and choice of every, every, everything: itcannot sink into my head, that she should be such an ass. Roger,I never believe it._Rog._ Here she comes now._Enter_ BELLAFRONT._Mis. F._ O sweet madonna, on with your loose gown,your felt[189] and your feather, there’s the sweetest,properest,[190] gallantest gentleman at my house; he smells allof musk and ambergris his pocket full of crowns, flame-coloureddoublet, red satin hose, carnation silk stockings, and a leg,and a body,-- oh![189] Hat.[190] Handsomest._Bell._ Hence thou, our sex’s monster, poisonous bawd,Lust’s factor, and damnation’s orator.Gossip of hell! were all the harlots’ sinsWhich the whole world contains, numbered together,Thine far exceeds them all: of all the creaturesThat ever were created, thou art basest.What serpent would beguile thee of thy office?It is detestable: for thou livestUpon the dregs of harlots, guard’st the door,Whilst couples go to dancing: O coarse devil!Thou art the bastard’s curse, thou brand’st his birth;The lecher’s French disease: for thou dry-suck’st him;The harlot’s poison, and thine own confusion._Mis. F._ Marry come up, with a pox, have you nobody to railagainst, but your bawd now?_Bell._ And you, knave pander, kinsman to a bawd._Rog._ You and I, madonna, are cousins._Bell._ Of the same blood and making, near allied;Thou, that art slave to sixpence, base metalled villain!_Rog._ Sixpence? nay, that’s not so: I never took under twoshillings four-pence; I hope I know my fee._Bell._ I know not against which most to inveigh:For both of you are damned so equally.Thou never spar’st for oaths, swear’st any thing,As if thy soul were made of shoe-leather:“God damn me, gentleman, if she be within!”When in the next room she’s found dallying._Rog._ If it be my vocation to swear, every man in his vocation:I hope my betters swear and damn themselves, and why should notI?_Bell._ Roger, you cheat kind gentlemen._Rog._ The more gulls they._Bell._ Slave, I cashier thee._Mis. F._ An you do cashier him, he shall be entertained._Rog._ Shall I? then blurt[191] a’ your service.[191] See note _ante_, p. 114._Bell._ As hell would have it, entertained by you!I dare the devil himself to match those two.      [_Exit.__Mis. F._ Marry gup, are you grown so holy, so pure, so honestwith a pox?_Rog._ Scurvy honest punk! but stay, madonna, how must ouragreement be now? for, you know, I am to have all the comings-inat the hall-door, and you at the chamber-door._Mis. F._ True Roger except my vails._Rog._ Vails? what vails?_Mis. F._ Why as thus; if a couple come in a coach, and light tolie down a little, then, Roger, that’s my fee, and you may walkabroad; for the coachman himself is their pander._Rog._ Is ’a so? in truth I have almost forgot, for want ofexercise. But how if I fetch this citizen’s wife to that gull,and that madonna to that gallant, how then?_Mis. F._ Why then, Roger, you are to have sixpence a lane; somany lanes, so many sixpences._Rog._ Is’t so? then I see we two shall agree, and live together._Mis. F._ Ay, Roger, so long as there be any taverns andbawdy-houses in Milan.

So, this is Monday morning, and now must I to myhuswifery.--[_Sets out a table, on which he places a skull, apicture of_ INFELICE, _a book, and a taper_.]--WouldI had been created a shoemaker, for all the gentle-craft aregentlemen every Monday by their copy, and scorn then to work onetrue stitch. My master means sure to turn me into a student,for here’s my book, here my desk, here my light, this my closechamber, and here my punk: so that this dull drowzy first dayof the week, makes me half a priest, half a chandler, half apainter, half a sexton, ay, and half a bawd; for all this daymy office is to do nothing but keep the door. To prove it, lookyou, this good face and yonder gentleman, so soon as ever myback is turned, will be naught together._Enter_ HIPPOLITO._Hip._ Are all the windows shut?_Ser._ Close, sir, as the fist of a courtier that hath stood inthree reigns._Hip._ Thou art a faithful servant, and observ’stThe calendar, both of my solemn vows,And ceremonious sorrow. Get thee gone;I charge thee on thy life, let not the soundOf any woman’s voice pierce through that door._Ser._ If they do, my lord, I’ll pierce some of them;What will your lordship have to breakfast?_Hip._ Sighs._Ser._ What to dinner?_Hip._ Tears._Ser._ The one of them, my lord, will fill you too full of wind,the other wet you too much. What to supper?_Hip._ That which now thou canst not get me, the constancy of awoman._Ser._ Indeed that’s harder to come by than ever was Ostend.[194][194] The siege of Ostend was protracted for three years andten weeks.--The place was eventually captured by the Marquis ofSpinola on Sep. 8, 1604._Hip._ Prithee, away._Ser._ I’ll make away myself presently, which few servants willdo for their lords; but rather help to make them away: Now to mydoor-keeping; I hope to pick something out of it. [_Aside andexit.__Hip._ [_Taking up_ INFELICE’S _picture_.] My Infelice’s face,      her brow, her eye,The dimple on her cheek! and such sweet skill,Hath from the cunning workman’s pencil flown,These lips look fresh and lively as her own,Seeming to move and speak. ’Las! now I see,The reason why fond[195] women love to buyAdulterate complexion! Here ’tis read:False colours last after the true be dead.Of all the roses grafted on her cheeks,Of all the graces dancing in her eyes,Of all the music set upon her tongue,Of all that was past woman’s excellence,In her white bosom,--look! a painted boardCircumscribes all: Earth can no bliss afford,Nothing of her but this. This cannot speak,It has no lap for me to rest upon,No lip worth tasting: here the worms will feed,As in her coffin: hence, then, idle art!True love’s best pictured in a true-love’s heart:Here art thou drawn, sweet maid, till this be dead;So that thou liv’st twice, twice art burièd:Thou figure of my friend, lie there. What’s      here?      [_Takes up the skull._Perhaps this shrewd pate was mine enemy’s:’Las! say it were: I need not fear him now!For all his braves, his contumelious breath,His frowns, though dagger-pointed, all his plots,Though ne’er so mischievous, his Italian pills,His quarrels, and that common fence, his law,See, see, they’re all eaten out! here’s not left one:How clean they’re picked away to the bare bone!How mad are mortals, then, to rear great namesOn tops of swelling houses! or to wear outTheir fingers’ ends in dirt, to scrape up gold!Not caring, so that sumpter-horse, the back,Be hung with gaudy trappings, with what coarse--Yea, rags most beggarly, they clothe the soul:Yet, after all, their gayness looks thus foul.What fools are men to build a garish tomb,Only to save the carcase whilst it rots,To maintain’t long in stinking, make good carrion,But leave no good deeds to preserve them sound!For good deeds keep men sweet, long above ground.And must all come to this? fools, wife, all hither?Must all heads thus at last be laid together?Draw me my picture then, thou grave neat workman,After this fashion, not like this; these colours,In time, kissing but air, will be kissed off:But here’s a fellow; that which he lays onTill doomsday alters not complexion:Death’s the best painter then: They that draw shapes,And live by wicked faces, are but God’s apes.They come but near the life, and there they stay;This fellow draws life too: his art is fuller,The pictures which he makes are without colour.[195] Foolish._Re-enter ~Servant~.__Ser._ Here’s a parson[196] would speak with you, sir.[196] _i.e._ A person,--thus spelt to mark the servant’smispronunciation._Hip._ Hah!_Ser._ A parson, sir, would speak with you._Hip._ Vicar?_Ser._ Vicar! no sir, has too good a face to be a vicar yet, ayouth, a very youth._Hip._ What youth? of man or woman? lock the doors._Ser._ If it be a woman, marrow-bones and potato pies keep mefrom meddling with her, for the thing has got the breeches! ’tisa male-varlet sure, my lord, for a woman’s tailor ne’er measuredhim._Hip._ Let him give thee his message and be gone._Ser._ He says he’s Signor Matheo’s man, but I know he lies._Hip._ How dost thou know it?_Ser._ ’Cause he has ne’er a beard: ’tis his boy, I think, sir,whosoe’er paid for his nursing._Hip._ Send him and keep the door.      [_Exit ~Servant~._[_Reads._] “_Fata si liceat mihi,Fingere arbitrio meo,Temperem zephyro leviVela._”[197]I’d sail were I to choose, not in the ocean,Cedars are shaken, when shrubs do feel no bruise.[197] From Seneca’s _Oedipus_._Enter_ BELLAFRONT, _dressed as a ~Page~, with aletter_.How? from Matheo?_Bell._ Yes, my lord._Hip._ Art sick?_Bell._ Not all in health, my lord._Hip._ Keep off._Bell._ I do.--Hard fate when women are compelled to woo.      [_Aside.__Hip._ This paper does speak nothing._Bell._ Yes, my lord,Matter of life it speaks, and therefore writIn hidden character: to me instructionMy master gives, and, ’less you please to stayTill you both meet, I can the text display._Hip._ Do so; read out._Bell._ I am already out:Look on my face, and read the strangest story!_Hip._ What, villain, ho?----_Re-enter ~Servant~.__Ser._ Call you, my lord?_Hip._ Thou slave, thou hast let in the devil!_Ser._ Lord bless us, where? he’s not cloven, my lord, that Ican see: besides the devil goes more like a gentleman than apage; good my lord, _Buon coraggio_![198][198] Ital. Good courage._Hip._ Thou hast let in a woman in man’s shape.And thou art damned for’t._Ser._ Not damned I hope for putting in a woman to a lord._Hip._ Fetch me my rapier,--do not; I shall kill thee.Purge this infected chamber of that plague,That runs upon me thus: Slave, thrust her hence._Ser._ Alas, my lord, I shall never be able to thrust her hencewithout help! Come, mermaid, you must to sea again._Bell._ Hear me but speak, my words shall be all music;Hear me but speak.      [_Knocking within.__Hip._ Another beats the door,T’other she-devil! look._Ser._ Why, then, hell’s broke loose._Hip._ Hence; guard the chamber: let no more come on,   [_Exit ~Servant~._One woman serves for man’s damnation--Beshrew thee, thou dost make me violateThe chastest and most sanctimonious vow,That e’er was entered in the court of Heaven!I was, on meditation’s spotless wings,Upon my journey thither; like a stormThou beat’st my ripened cogitations,Flat to the ground: and like a thief dost stand,To steal devotion from the holy land._Bell._ If woman were thy mother--if thy heart,Be not all marble, or if’t marble be,Let my tears soften it, to pity me--I do beseech thee, do not thus with scornDestroy a woman!_Hip._ Woman, I beseech thee,Get thee some other suit, this fits thee not:I would not grant it to a kneeling queen,I cannot love thee, nor I must not: see      [_Points to_ INFELICE’S _picture_.The copy of that obligation,Where my soul’s bound in heavy penalties._Bell._ She’s dead, you told me, she’ll let fall her suit._Hip._ My vows to her, fled after her to Heaven:Were thine eyes clear as mine, thou might’st behold her,Watching upon yon battlements of stars,How I observe them. Should I break my bond,This board would rive in twain, these wooden lipsCall me most perjured villain. Let it suffice,I ha’ set thee in the path; is’t not a signI love thee, when with one so most most dear,I’ll have thee fellow? All are fellows there._Bell._ Be greater than a king; save not a body,But from eternal shipwreck keep a soul,If not, and that again, sin’s path I tread,The grief be mine, the guilt fall on thy head!_Hip._ Stay, and take physic for it; read this book,Ask counsel of this head, what’s to be done;He’ll strike it dead, that ’tis damnationIf you turn Turk again. Oh, do it not!Though Heaven cannot allure you to do well,From doing ill let hell fright you: and learn this,The soul whose bosom lust did never touch,Is God’s fair bride, and maidens’ souls are such:The soul that leaving chastity’s white shore,Swims in hot sensual streams, is the devil’s whore.--_Re-enter ~Servant~ with letter._How now, who comes?_Ser._ No more knaves, my lord, that wear smocks: here’s aletter from Doctor Benedict; I would not enter his man, thoughhe had hairs at his mouth, for fear he should be a woman,for some women have beards; marry, they are half-witches.’Slid![199] you are a sweet youth to wear a cod-piece, and haveno pins to stick upon’t.[199] “Slid” according to Halliwell is a north country oath._Hip._ I’ll meet the doctor, tell him; yet to-nightI cannot: but at morrow rising sunI will not fail.--[_Exit ~Servant~._]--Go, woman; fare thee      well.      [_Exit.__Bell._ The lowest fall can be but into hell:It does not move him I must therefore flyFrom this undoing city, and with tearsWash off all anger from my father’s brow;He cannot sure but joy, seeing me new born.A woman honest first, and then turn whore,Is, as with me, common to thousands more:But from a strumpet to turn chaste, that soundHas oft been heard, that woman hardly found.      [_Exit._SCENE II. _A Street.__Enter_ FUSTIGO, CRAMBO, _and_ POH._Fus._ Hold up your hands, gentlemen, here’s one, two, three[_Giving money_]--nay, I warrant they are sound pistoles, andwithout flaws; I had them of my sister and I know she uses toput up nothing that’s cracked--four, five, six, seven, eightand nine; by this hand bring me but a piece of his blood, andyou shall have nine more. I’ll lurk in a tavern not far off,and provide supper to close up the end of the tragedy: thelinen-draper’s, remember. Stand to’t, I beseech you, and playyour parts perfectly._Cram._ Look you, signor, ’tis not your gold that we weigh--_Fus._ Nay, nay, weigh it and spare not; if it lack one grain ofcorn, I’ll give you a bushel of wheat to make it up._Cram._ But by your favour, signor, which of the servants is it?because we’ll punish justly._Fus._ Marry ’tis the head man; you shall taste him by histongue; a pretty, tall, prating fellow, with a Tuscalonian beard._Poh._ Tuscalonian? very good._Fus._ God’s life, I was ne’er so thrummed since I was agentleman: my coxcomb was dry beaten, as if my hair had beenhemp._Cram._ We’ll dry-beat some of them._Fus._ Nay, it grew so high, that my sister cried out murder,very manfully: I have her consent, in a manner, to have himpeppered: else I’ll not do’t, to win more than ten cheaters doat a rifling: break but his pate, or so, only his mazer,[200]because I’ll have his head in a cloth as well as mine; he’s alinen-draper, and may take enough. I could enter mine action ofbattery against him, but we may’haps be both dead and rottenbefore the lawyers would end it.[200] A corruption of “mazzard,” the head._Cram._ No more to do, but ensconce yourself i’th’ tavern;provide no great cheer, a couple of capons, some pheasants,plovers, an orangeado-pie, or so: but how bloody howsoe’er theday be, sally you not forth._Fus._ No, no; nay if I stir, some body shall stink: I’ll notbudge: I’ll lie like a dog in a manger._Cram._ Well, well, to the tavern, let not our supper be raw,for you shall have blood enough, your bellyful._Fus._ That’s all, so God sa’ me, I thirst after; blood forblood, bump for bump, nose for nose, head for head, plaster forplaster; and so farewell. What shall I call your names? becauseI’ll leave word, if any such come to the bar._Cram._ My name is Corporal Crambo._Poh._ And mine, Lieutenant Poh._Cram._ Poh is as tall a man as ever opened oyster:I would not be the devil to meet Poh: farewell._Fus._ Nor I, by this light, if Poh be such a Poh.

CANDIDO’S _Shop_._Enter_ VIOLA _and the two ~Prentices~_._Vio._ What’s a’clock now?_2nd Pren._ ’Tis almost twelve._Vio._ That’s well,The Senate will leave wording presently:But is George ready?_2nd Pren._ Yes, forsooth, he’s furbished._Vio._ Now, as you ever hope to win my favour,Throw both your duties and respects on him,With the like awe as if he were your master,Let not your looks betray it with a smile,Or jeering glance to any customer;Keep a true settled countenance, and bewareYou laugh not, whatsoe’er you hear or see._2nd Pren._ I warrant you, mistress, let us alone for keepingour countenance: for, if I list, there’s ne’er a fool in allMilan shall make me laugh, let him play the fool never so likean ass, whether it be the fat court-fool, or the lean city-fool._Vio._ Enough then, call down George._2nd Pren._ I hear him coming._Vio._ Be ready with your legs[201] then, let me seeHow courtesy would become him.--[201] _i.e._ In bowing._Enter_ GEORGE _in_ CANDIDO’S _apparel_.Beshrew my blood, a proper seemly man. Gallantly!Of a choice carriage, walks with a good port!_Geo._ I thank you, mistress, my back’s broad enough, now mymaster’s gown’s on._Vio._ Sure, I should think it were the least of sin,To mistake the master, and to let him in._Geo._ ’Twere a good Comedy of Errors[202] that, i’faith.[202] An allusion, no doubt, to Shakespeare’s comedy._2nd Pren._ Whist, whist! my master._Vio._ You all know your tasks._Enter_ CANDIDO,[203] _dressed as before in the carpet:he stares at_ GEORGE, _and exit_.[203] Dyce points out the inconsistency, that Candido has justreturned from the Senate House, although it appears from theintermediate Scenes that since he left home a night has elapsed.God’s my life, what’s that he has got upon’s back? who can tell?_Geo._ [_Aside._] That can I, but I will not._Vio._ Girt about him like a madman! what has he lost his cloaktoo? This is the maddest fashion that e’er I saw. What said he,George, when he passed by thee?_Geo._ Troth, mistress, nothing: not so much as a bee, he didnot hum: not so much as a bawd, he did not hem: not so much as acuckold, he did not ha: neither hum, hem, nor ha; only stared mein the face, passed along, and made haste in, as if my looks hadworked with him, to give him a stool._Vio._ Sure he’s vexed now, this trick has moved his spleen,He’s angered now, because he uttered nothing:And wordless wrath breaks out more violent,May be he’ll strive for place, when he comes down,But if thou lov’st me, George, afford him none._Geo._ Nay, let me alone to play my master’s prize,[204] as longas my mistress warrants me: I’m sure I have his best clothes on,and I scorn to give place to any that is inferior in apparel tome, that’s an axiom, a principle, and is observed as much as thefashion; let that persuade you then, that I’ll shoulder withhim for the upper hand in the shop, as long as this chain willmaintain it.[204] A quibble. A master’s was one of the three degrees infencing, for each of which a “prize” was publicly played._Vio._ Spoke with the spirit of a master, though with the tongueof a prentice._Re-enter_ CANDIDO _dressed as a ~Prentice~_.Why how now, madman? what in your tricksi-coats?_Cand._ O peace, good mistress._Enter_ CRAMBO _and_ POH.See, what you lack? what is’t you buy? pure calicoes, fineHollands, choice cambrics, neat lawns: see what you buy? praycome near, my master will use you well, he can afford you apenny-worth._Vio._ Ay, that he can, out of a whole piece of lawn i’faith._Cand._ Pray see your choice here, gentlemen._Vio._ O fine fool! what, a madman! a patient madman! who everheard of the like? Well, sir, I’ll fit you and your humourpresently: what, cross-points? I’ll untie ’em all in a trice:I’ll vex you i’faith: boy, take your cloak, quick, come. [_Exitwith ~1st Prentice~.__Cand._ Be covered, George, this chain and welted gownBare to this coat? then the world’s upside down._Geo._ Umh, umh, hum._Cram._ That’s the shop, and there’s the fellow._Poh._ Ay, but the master is walking in there._Cram._ No matter, we’ll in._Poh._ ’Sblood, dost long to lie in limbo?_Cram._ An limbo be in hell, I care not._Cand._ Look you, gentlemen, your choice: cambrics?_Cram._ No, sir, some shirting._Cand._ You shall._Cram._ Have you none of this striped canvas for doublets?_Cand._ None striped, sir, but plain._2nd Pren._ I think there be one piece striped within._Geo._ Step, sirrah, and fetch it, hum, hum, hum. [_Exit ~2ndPren.~, and returns with the piece.__Cand._ Look you, gentleman, I’ll make but one spreading, here’sa piece of cloth, fine, yet shall wear like iron, ’tis withoutfault; take this upon my word, ’tis without fault._Cram._ Then ’tis better than you, sirrah._Cand._ Ay, and a number more: Oh, that each soulWere but as spotless as this innocent white,And had as few breaks in it!_Cram._ ’Twould have some then:There was a fray here last day in this shop._Cand._ There was, indeed, a little flea-biting._Poh._ A gentleman had his pate broke; call you that but aflea-biting?_Cand._ He had so._Cram._ Zounds, do you stand to it? [_Strikes_ CANDIDO._Geo._ ’Sfoot, clubs, clubs! prentices, down with ’em!_Enter several ~Prentices~ with clubs, who disarm_CRAMBO _and_ POH.Ah, you rogues, strike a citizen in’s shop?_Cand._ None of you stir, I pray; forbear, good George._Cram._ I beseech you, sir, we mistook our marks; deliver us ourweapons._Geo._ Your head bleeds, sir; cry clubs!_Cand._ I say you shall not; pray be patient,Give them their weapons: sirs, you’d best be gone,I tell you here are boys more tough than bears:Hence, lest more fists do walk about your ears._Cram._, _Poh._ We thank you, sir.      [_Exeunt.__Cand._ You shall not follow them;Let them alone, pray; this did me no harm;Troth, I was cold, and the blow made me warm,I thank ’em for’t: besides, I had decreedTo have a vein pricked, I did mean to bleed:So that there’s money saved: they’re honest men,Pray use ’em well, when they appear again._Geo._ Yes, sir, we’ll use ’em like honest men._Cand._ Ay, well said, George, like honest men, though they bearrant knaves, for that’s the phrase of the city; help to lay upthese wares._Re-enter_ VIOLA _and ~1st Prentice~ with ~Officers~_._Vio._ Yonder he stands._1st Off._ What in a prentice-coat?_Vio._ Ay, ay; mad, mad; pray take heed._Cand._ How now! what news with them?What make they with my wife?Officers, is she attached?--Look to your wares._Vio._ He talks to himself: oh, he’s much gone indeed._1st Off._ Pray, pluck up a good heart, be not so fearful:Sirs, hark, we’ll gather to him by degrees._Vio._ Ay, ay, by degrees I pray: Oh me! What makes he with thelawn in his hand? He’ll tear all the ware in my shop._1st Off._ Fear not, we’ll catch him on a sudden._Vio._ Oh! you had need do so; pray take heed of your warrant._1st Off._ I warrant, mistress. Now, Signor Candido._Cand._ Now, sir, what news with you, sir?_Vio._ What news with you? he says: oh, he’s far gone!_1st Off._ I pray, fear nothing; let’s alone with him,Signor, you look not like yourself, methinks,--Steal you a’ t’other side; you’re changed, you’re altered._Cand._ Changed, sir, why true, sir. Is change strange? ’Tis notThe fashion unless it alter! monarchs turnTo beggars, beggars creep into the nestsOf princes, masters serve their prentices,Ladies their serving-men, men turn to women._1st Off._ And women turn to men._Cand._ Ay, and women turn to men, you say true: ha, ha, a madworld, a mad world. [_~Officers~ seize_ CANDIDO._1st Off._ Have we caught you, sir?_Cand._ Caught me? well, well, you have caught me._Vio._ He laughs in your faces._Geo._ A rescue, prentices! my master’s catchpolled._1st Off._ I charge you, keep the peace, or have your legsGartered with irons! we have from the dukeA warrant strong enough for what we do._Cand._ I pray, rest quiet, I desire no rescue._Vio._ La, he desires no rescue, ’las poor heart,He talks against himself._Cand._ Well, what’s the matter?_1st Off._ Look to that arm,      [_~Officers~ bind_ CANDIDO.Pray, make sure work, double the cord._Cand._ Why, why?_Vio._ Look how his head goes, should he get but loose,Oh ’twere as much as all our lives were worth!_1st Off._ Fear not, we’ll make all sure for our own safety._Cand._ Are you at leisure now? well, what’s the matter?Why do I enter into bonds thus, ha?_1st Off._ Because you’re mad, put fear upon your wife._Vio._ Oh ay, I went in danger of my life every minute._Cand._ What, am I mad, say you, and I not know it?_1st Off._ That proves you mad, because you know it not._Vio._ Pray talk to him as little as you can,You see he’s too far spent._Cand._ Bound, with strong cord!A sister’s thread, i’faith, had been enough,To lead me anywhere.--Wife, do you long?You are mad too, or else you do me wrong._Geo._ But are you mad indeed, master?_Cand._ My wife says so,And what she says, George, is all truth, you know.--And whither now, to Bethlem Monastery?Ha! whither?_1st Off._ Faith, e’en to the madmen’s pound._Cand._ A’ God’s name! still I feel my patience sound.      [_Exeunt                                            ~Officers~ with_ CANDIDO._Geo._ Come, we’ll see whither he goes; if the master be mad, weare his servants, and must follow his steps; we’ll be mad-capstoo. Farewell, mistress, you shall have us all in Bedlam.[_Exeunt_ GEORGE _and ~Prentices~_._Vio._ I think I ha’ fitted you now, you and your clothes,If this move not his patience, nothing can;I’ll swear then I’ve a saint, and not a man.      [_Exit._SCENE IV.--_Grounds near the_ DUKE’S _Palace_._Enter_ DUKE, Doctor BENEDICT, FLUELLO, CASTRUCHIO, _and_ PIORATTO._Duke._ Give us a little leave.[_Exeunt_ FLUELLO, CASTRUCHIO, _and_PIORATTO.                                Doctor, your news._Doct._ I sent for him my lord, at last he came,And did receive all speech that went from me,As gilded pills made to prolong his health.My credit with him wrought it; for some menSwallow even empty hooks, like fools that fearNo drowning where ’tis deepest, ’cause ’tis clear:In th’end we sat and eat: a health I drankTo Infelice’s sweet departed soul.This train I knew would take._Duke._ ’Twas excellent._Doct._ He fell with such devotion on his knees,To pledge the fame--_Duke._ Fond, superstitious fool!_Doct._ That had he been inflamed with zeal of prayer,He could not pour’t out with more reverence:About my neck he hung, wept on my cheek,Kissed it, and swore he would adore my lips,Because they brought forth Infelice’s name._Duke._ Ha, ha! alack, alack._Doct._ The cup he lifts up high, and thus he said;Here noble maid!--drinks, and was poisonèd._Duke._ And died?_Doct._ And died, my lord._Duke._ Thou in that wordHast pieced mine aged hours out with more years,Than thou hast taken from Hippolito.A noble youth he was, but lesser branchesHindering the greater’s growth, must be lopt off,And feed the fire. Doctor, we’re now all thine,And use us so: be bold._Doct._ Thanks, gracious lord--My honoured lord:--_Duke._ Hum._Doct._ I do beseech your grace to bury deep,This bloody act of mine._Duke._ Nay, nay, for that,Doctor, look you to it, me it shall not move;They’re cursed that ill do, not that ill do love._Doct._ You throw an angry forehead on my face:But be you pleased backward thus far to look,That for your good, this evil I undertook--_Duke._ Ay, ay, we conster[205] so.[205] Construe._Doct._ And only for your love._Duke._ Confessed: ’tis true._Doct._ Nor let it stand against me as a bar,To thrust me from your presence; nor believeAs princes have quick thoughts, that now my fingerBeing dipt in blood, I will not spare the hand,But that for gold,--as what can gold not do?--I may be hired to work the like on you._Duke._ Which to prevent--_Doct._ ’Tis from my heart as far._Duke._ No matter, doctor; ’cause I’ll fearless sleep,And that you shall stand clear of that suspicion,I banish thee for ever from my court.This principle is old, but true as fate,Kings may love treason, but the traitor hate.      [_Exit.__Doct._ Is’t so? nay then, duke, your stale principle,With one as stale, the doctor thus shall quit--He falls himself that digs another’s pit._Enter the ~Doctor’s Servant~._How now! where is he? will he meet me?_Ser._ Meet you, sir? he might have met with three fencersin this time, and have received less hurt than by meetingone doctor of physic: Why, sir, he has walked under the oldabbey-wall yonder this hour, till he’s more cold than acitizen’s country house in Janivery. You may smell him behind,sir: la, you, yonder he comes._Doct._ Leave me._Ser._ I’th’ lurch, if you will. [_Exit.__Enter_ HIPPOLITO._Doct._ O my most noble friend!_Hip._ Few but yourself,Could have enticed me thus, to trust the airWith my close sighs. You sent for me; what news?_Doct._ Come, you must doff this black, dye that pale cheekInto his own colour, go, attire yourselfFresh as a bridegroom when he meets his bride.The duke has done much treason to thy love;’Tis now revealed, ’tis now to be revenged:Be merry, honoured friend, thy lady lives._Hip._ What lady?_Doct._ Infelice, she’s revived;Revived? Alack! death never had the heart,To take breath from her._Hip._ Umh: I thank you, sir,Physic prolongs life, when it cannot save;This helps not my hopes, mine are in their grave,You do some wrong to mock me._Doct._ By that loveWhich I have ever borne you, what I speakIs truth: the maiden lives; that funeral,Duke’s tears, the mourning, was all counterfeit;A sleepy draught cozened the world and you:I was his minister, and then chambered up,To stop discovery._Hip._ O treacherous duke!_Doct._ He cannot hope so certainly for bliss,As he believes that I have poisoned you:He wooed me to’t; I yielded, and confirmed himIn his most bloody thoughts._Hip._ A very devil!_Doct._ Her did he closely coach to Bergamo,And thither--_Hip._ Will I ride: stood BergamoIn the low countries of black hell, I’ll to her._Doct._ You shall to her, but not to Bergamo:How passion makes you fly beyond yourself.Much of that weary journey I ha’ cut off;For she by letters hath intelligenceOf your supposed death, her own interment,And all those plots, which that false duke, her father,Has wrought against you; and she’ll meet you--_Hip._ Oh, when?_Doct._ Nay, see; how covetous are your desires!Early to-morrow morn._Hip._ Oh where, good father?_Doct._ At Bethlem Monastery: are you pleased now?_Hip._ At Bethlem Monastery! the place well fits,It is the school where those that lose their wits,Practise again to get them: I am sickOf that disease; all love is lunatic._Doct._ We’ll steal away this night in some disguise:Father Anselmo, a most reverend friar,Expects our coming; before whom we layReasons so strong, that he shall yield in bandsOf holy wedlock to tie both your hands._Hip._ This is such happiness,That to believe it, ’tis impossible._Doct._ Let all your joys then die in misbelief;I will reveal no more._Hip._ O yes, good father,I am so well acquainted with despair,I know not how to hope: I believe all._Doct._ We’ll hence this night, much must be done, much said:But if the doctor fail not in his charms,Your lady shall ere morning fill these arms._Hip._ Heavenly physician! for thy fame shall spread,That mak’st two lovers speak when they be dead.      [_Exeunt._ACT THE FIFTH.SCENE I.--_A Hall in the_ DUKE’S _Palace_._Enter_ VIOLA, _with a petition and_ GEORGE.VIO. Oh watch, good George, watch which way the duke comes._Geo._ Here comes one of the butterflies; ask him._Enter_ PIORATTO._Vio._ Pray, sir, comes the duke this way?_Pio._ He’s upon coming, mistress._Vio._ I thank you, sir. [_Exit_ PIORATTO.] George, arethere many mad folks where thy master lies?_Geo._ Oh yes, of all countries some; but especially mad Greeks,they swarm. Troth mistress, the world is altered with you; youhad not wont to stand thus with a paper humbly complaining: butyou’re well enough served: provender pricked you, as it doesmany of our city wives besides._Vio._ Dost think, George, we shall get him forth?_Geo._ Truly, mistress, I cannot tell; I think you’ll hardly gethim forth. Why, ’tis strange! ’Sfoot, I have known many womenthat have had mad rascals to their husbands, whom they wouldbelabour by all means possible to keep ’em in their right wits,but of a woman to long to turn a tame man into a madman, why thedevil himself was never used so by his dam._Vio._ How does he talk, George! ha! good George, tell me._Geo._ Why you’re best go see._Vio._ Alas, I am afraid!_Geo._ Afraid! you had more need be ashamed, he may rather beafraid of you._Vio._ But, George, he’s not stark mad, is he? he does not rave,he is not horn-mad, George, is he?_Geo._ Nay I know not that, but he talks like a justice ofpeace, of a thousand matters, and to no purpose._Vio._ I’ll to the monastery: I shall be mad till I enjoy him,I shall be sick until I see him; yet when I do see him, I shallweep out mine eyes._Geo._ I’d fain see a woman weep out her eyes, that’s as true asto say, a man’s cloak burns, when it hangs in the water: I knowyou’ll weep, mistress, but what says the painted cloth?[206][206] A cheap substitute for tapestry and very frequently havingverses inscribed on it as in the present instance.Trust not a woman when she cries,For she’ll pump water from her eyesWith a wet finger,[207] and in faster showers,Than April when he rains down flowers.[207] Readily. Possibly the above use of the term points to itsderivation._Vio._ Ay, but George, that painted cloth is worthy to be hangedup for lying; all women have not tears at will, unless they havegood cause._Geo._ Ay, but mistress, how easily will they find a cause, andas one of our cheese-trenchers[208] says very learnedly,[208] Cheese-trenchers used to be inscribed with proverbialphrases.As out of wormwood bees suck honey,As from poor clients lawyers firk money,As parsley from a roasted cony:So, though the day be ne’er so funny,If wives will have it rain, down then it drives,The calmest husbands make the stormiest wives--_Vio._ --Tame, George. But I ha’ done storming now._Geo._ Why that’s well done: good mistress, throw aside thisfashion of your humour, be not so fantastical in wearing it:storm no more, long no more. This longing has made you comeshort of many a good thing that you might have had from mymaster: Here comes the duke._Enter_ DUKE, FLUELLO, PIORATTO,_and_ SINEZI._Vio._ O, I beseech you, pardon my offence,In that I durst abuse your grace’s warrant;Deliver forth my husband, good my lord._Duke._ Who is her husband?_Flu._ Candido, my lord._Duke._ Where is he?_Vio._ He’s among the lunatics;He was a man made up without a gall;Nothing could move him, nothing could convertHis meek blood into fury; yet like a monster,I often beat at the most constant rockOf his unshaken patience, and did longTo vex him._Duke._ Did you so?_Vio._ And for that purpose,Had warrant from your grace, to carry himTo Bethlem Monastery, whence they will not free him,Without your grace’s hand that sent him in._Duke._ You have longed fair; ’tis you are mad, I fear;It’s fit to fetch him thence, and keep you there:If he be mad, why would you have him forth?_Geo._ An please your grace, he’s not stark mad, but only talkslike a young gentleman, somewhat fantastically, that’s all:there’s a thousand about your court, city, and country madderthan he._Duke._ Provide a warrant, you shall have our hand._Geo._ Here’s a warrant ready drawn, my lord._Duke._ Get pen and ink, get pen and ink. [_Exit_ GEO._Enter_ CASTRUCHIO._Cas._ Where is my lord the duke?_Duke._ How now! more madmen?_Cas._ I have strange news, my lord._Duke._ Of what? of whom?_Cas._ Of Infelice, and a marriage._Duke._ Ha! where? with whom?_Cas._ Hippolito._Re-enter_ GEORGE, _with pen and ink_._Geo._ Here, my lord._Duke._ Hence, with that woman! void the room!_Flu._ Away! the duke’s vexed._Geo._ Whoop, come, mistress, the duke’s mad too. [_Exeunt_VIOLA _and_ GEORGE._Duke._ Who told me that Hippolito was dead?_Cas._ He that can make any man dead, the doctor: but, my lord,he’s as full of life as wild-fire, and as quick. Hippolito, thedoctor, and one more rid hence this evening; the inn at whichthey light is Bethlem Monastery; Infelice comes from Bergamo andmeets them there. Hippolito is mad, for he means this day to bemarried; the afternoon is the hour, and Friar Anselmo is theknitter._Duke._ From Bergamo? is’t possible? it cannot be.It cannot be._Cas._ I will not swear, my lord;But this intelligence I took from oneWhose brains work in the plot._Duke._ What’s he?_Cas._ Matheo._Flu._ Matheo knows all._Pior._ He’s Hippolito’s bosom._Duke._ How far stands Bethlem hence?_Cas._, _Flu._, _&c._ Six or seven miles._Duke._ Is’t so? not married till the afternoon:Stay, stay, let’s work out some prevention. How!This is most strange; can none but mad men serveTo dress their wedding dinner? All of youGet presently to horse, disguise yourselvesLike country-gentlemen,Or riding citizens, or so: and takeEach man a several path, but let us meetAt Bethlem Monastery, some space of timeBeing spent between the arrival each of other,As if we came to see the lunatics.To horse, away! be secret on your lives.Love must be punished that unjustly thrives.      [_Exeunt                                          all but_ FLUELLO._Flu._ Be secret on your lives! Castruchio,You’re but a scurvy spaniel; honest lord,Good lady: zounds, their love is just, ’tis good,And I’ll prevent you, though I swim in blood.      [_Exit._SCENE II. _An Apartment in Bethlem Monastery.__Enter ~Friar~_ ANSELMO, HIPPOLITO,MATHEO, _and_ INFELICE._Hip._ Nay, nay, resolve,[209] good father, or deny.[209] Consent._Ans._ You press me to an act, both full of danger,And full of happiness; for I beholdYour father’s frowns, his threats, nay, perhaps deathTo him that dare do this: yet, noble lord,Such comfortable beams break through these cloudsBy this blest marriage, that your honoured wordBeing pawned in my defence, I will tie fastThe holy wedding-knot._Hip._ Tush, fear not the duke._Ans._ O son! wisely to fear, is to be free from fear._Hip._ You have our words, and you shall have our lives,To guard you safe from all ensuing danger._Mat._ Ay, ay, chop ’em up, and away._Ans._ Stay, when is’t fit for me, and safest for you,To entertain this business?_Hip._ Not till the evening._Ans._ Be’t so, there is a chapel stands hard by,Upon the west end of the abbey wall;Thither convey yourselves, and when the sunHath turned his back upon this upper world,I’ll marry you; that done, no thundering voiceCan break the sacred bond: yet, lady, hereYou are most safe._Inf._ Father, your love’s most dear._Mat._ Ay, well said, lock us into some little room byourselves, that we may be mad for an hour or two._Hip._ O, good Matheo, no, let’s make no noise._Mat._ How! no noise! do you know where you are? ’sfoot, amongstall the mad-caps in Milan: so that to throw the house out atwindow will be the better, and no man will suspect that we lurkhere to steal mutton[210]: the more sober we are, the morescurvy ’tis. And though the friar tell us, that here we aresafest, I am not of his mind, for if those lay here that hadlost their money, none would ever look after them, but here arenone but those that have lost their wits, so that if hue and crybe made, hither they’ll come; and my reason is, because nonegoes to be married till he be stark mad.[210] _i.e._ To steal a wench._Hip._ Muffle yourselves, yonder’s Fluello._Enter_ FLUELLO._Mat._ Zounds!_Flu._ O my lord, these cloaks are not for this rain! thetempest is too great: I come sweating to tell you of it, thatyou may get out of it._Mat._ Why, what’s the matter?_Flu._ What’s the matter? you have mattered it fair: the duke’sat hand._All._ The duke?_Flu._ The very duke._Hip._ Then all our plotsAre turned upon our heads; and we’re blown upWith our own underminings. ’Sfoot, how comes he?What villain durst betray our being here?_Flu._ Castruchio! Castruchio told the duke, and Matheo heretold Castruchio._Hip._ Would you betray me to Castruchio?_Mat._ ’Sfoot, he damned himself to the pit of hell, if he spakeon’t again._Hip._ So did you swear to me: so were you damned._Mat._ Pox on ’em, and there be no faith in men, if a man shallnot believe oaths: he took bread and salt,[211] by this light,that he would never open his lips.[211] It was the ancient practice when persons were sworn forthem to eat bread and salt._Hip._ O God, O God!_Ans._ Son, be not desperate,Have patience, you shall trip your enemyDown by his own slights.[212] How far is the duke hence?[212] Artifices._Flu._ He’s but new set out: Castruchio, Pioratto and Sinezicome along with him; you have time enough yet to prevent[213]them, if you have but courage.[213] Anticipate._Ans._ Ye shall steal secretly into the chapel,And presently be married. If the dukeAbide here still, spite of ten thousand eyes,You shall ’scape hence like friars._Hip._ O blest disguise! O happy man!_Ans._ Talk not of happiness till your closed handHave her by th’ forehead, like the lock of Time:Be nor too slow, nor hasty, now you climbUp to the tower of bliss; only be waryAnd patient, that’s all: If you like my plot,Build and despatch; if not, farewell, then not._Hip._ O yes, we do applaud it! we’ll disputeNo longer, but will hence and execute.Fluello, you’ll stay here: let us be gone;The ground that frighted lovers tread uponIs stuck with thorns._Ans._ Come, then, away, ’tis meet,To escape those thorns, to put on wingèd feet.      [_Exeunt_                            ANSELMO, HIPPOLITO _and_ INFELICE._Mat._ No words, I pray, Fluello, for’t stands us upon._Flu._ Oh, sir, let that be your lesson!      [_Exit_ MATHEO.Alas, poor lovers! On what hopes and fearsMen toss themselves for women! When she’s got,The best has in her that which pleaseth not._Enter the_ DUKE, CASTRUCHIO,PIORATTO, _and_ SINEZI _from different doors,muffled_._Duke._ Who’s there?_Cas._ My lord._Duke._ Peace; send that lord away.A lordship will spoil all; let’s be all fellows.What’s he?_Cas._ Fluello, or else Sinezi, by his little legs._Cas._, _Flu._, _Pio._ All friends, all friends._Duke._ What? met upon the very point of time?Is this the place?_Pio._ This is the place, my lord._Duke._ Dream you on lordships? come no more lords, I pray:You have not seen these lovers yet?_All._ Not yet._Duke._ Castruchio, art thou sure this wedding feastIs not till afternoon?_Cas._ So’t is given out, my lord._Duke._ Nay, nay, ’tis like; thieves must observe their hours;Lovers watch minutes like astronomers;How shall the interim hours by us be spent?_Flu._ Let’s all go see the madmen._Cas._, _Pio._, _Sin._ Mass, content._Enter a ~Sweeper~.__Duke._ Oh, here comes one; question him, question him._Flu._ Now, honest fellow? dost thou belong to the house?_Sweep._ Yes, forsooth, I am one of the implements, I sweep themadmen’s rooms, and fetch straw for ’em, and buy chains to tie’em, and rods to whip ’em. I was a mad wag myself here, once,but I thank Father Anselmo, he lashed me into my right mindagain._Duke._ Anselmo is the friar must marry them;Question him where he is._Cas._ And where is Father Anselmo now?_Sweep._ Marry, he’s gone but e’en now._Duke._ Ay, well done.--Tell me, whither is he gone?_Sweep._ Why, to God a’mighty._Flu._ Ha, ha! this fellow’s a fool, talks idly._Pio._ Sirrah, are all the mad folks in Milan brought hither?_Sweep._ How, all? there’s a question indeed: why if all the madfolks in Milan should come hither, there would not be left tenmen in the city._Duke._ Few gentlemen or courtiers here, ha?_Sweep._ O yes, abundance, abundance! lands no sooner fall intotheir hands, but straight they run out a’ their wits: citizens’sons and heirs are free of the house by their fathers’ copy.Farmers’ sons come hither like geese, in flocks, and when theyha’ sold all their corn-fields, here they sit and pick thestraws._Sin._ Methinks you should have women here as well as men._Sweep._ Oh, ay, a plague on ’em, there’s no ho![214] with ’em;they’re madder than March hares.[214] _i.e._ They are not to be restrained by being called to._Flu._ Are there no lawyers amongst you?_Sweep._ Oh no, not one; never any lawyer, we dare not leta lawyer come in, for he’ll make ’em mad faster than we canrecover ’em._Duke._ And how long is’t ere you recover any of these?_Sweep._ Why, according to the quantity of the moon that’s gotinto ’em. An alderman’s son will be mad a great while, a verygreat while, especially if his friends left him well; a whorewill hardly come to her wits again: a puritan, there’s no hopeof him, unless he may pull down the steeple, and hang himself i’th’ bell-ropes._Flu._ I perceive all sorts of fish come to your net._Sweep._ Yes, in truth, we have blocks[215] for all heads; wehave good store of wild-oats here: for the courtier is mad atthe citizen, the citizen is mad at the countryman; the shoemakeris mad at the cobbler, the cobbler at the car-man; the punk ismad that the merchant’s wife is no whore, the merchant’s wife ismad that the punk is so common a whore. Gods so, here’s FatherAnselmo; pray say nothing that I tell tales out of the school.[_Exit._[215] Hats._Re-enter_ ANSELMO _and ~Servants~_._All._ God bless you, father._Ans._ I thank you, gentlemen._Cas._ Pray, may we see some of those wretched souls,That here are in your keeping?_Ans._ Yes, you shall.But gentlemen, I must disarm you then:There are of mad men, as there are of tame,All humoured not alike: we have here some,So apish and fantastic, play with a feather,And, though ’twould grieve a soul to see God’s imageSo blemished and defaced, yet do they actSuch antic and such pretty lunacies,That spite of sorrow they will make you smile:Others again we have like hungry lions,Fierce as wild-bulls, untameable as flies,And these have oftentimes from strangers’ sidesSnatched rapiers suddenly, and done much harm,Whom if you’ll see, you must be weaponless._All._ With all our hearts.      [_Giving their weapons to_ ANSELMO._Ans._ Here, take these weapons in,--      [_Exit ~Servant~                                               with weapons._Stand off a little, pray; so, so, ’tis well:I’ll show you here a man that was sometimesA very grave and wealthy citizen;Has served a prenticeship to this misfortune,Been here seven years, and dwelt in Bergamo._Duke._ How fell he from his wits?_Ans._ By loss at sea;I’ll stand aside, question him you alone,For if he spy me, he’ll not speak a word,Unless he’s throughly vexed.[_Opens a door and then retires: enter ~1st Madman~, wrapt in anet.__Flu._ Alas, poor soul!_Cas._ A very old man._Duke._ God speed, father!_1st Mad._ God speed the plough, thou shalt not speed me._Pio._ We see you, old man, for all you dance in a net._1st Mad._ True, but thou wilt dance in a halter, and I shallnot see thee._Ans._ Oh do not vex him, pray._Cas._ Are you a fisherman, father?_1st Mad._ No, I am neither fish nor flesh._Flu._ What do you with that net then?_1st Mad._ Dost not see, fool? there’s a fresh salmon in’t; ifyou step one foot further, you’ll be over shoes, for you seeI’m over head and ears in the salt-water: and if you fall intothis whirl-pool where I am, you’re drowned: you’re a drownedrat. I am fishing here for five ships, but I cannot have a gooddraught, for my net breaks still, and breaks; but I’ll breaksome of your necks an I catch you in my clutches. Stay, stay,stay, stay, stay, where’s the wind? where’s the wind? where’sthe wind? where’s the wind? Out you gulls, you goose-caps, yougudgeon-eaters! do you look for the wind in the heavens? ha, ha,ha, ha! no, no! look there, look there, look there! the wind isalways at that door: hark how it blows, puff, puff, puff!_All._ Ha, ha, ha!_1st Mad._ Do you laugh at God’s creatures? Do you mock old age,you rogues? Is this gray beard and head counterfeit that youcry, ha, ha, ha? Sirrah, art not thou my eldest son?_Pio._ Yes indeed, father._1st Mad._ Then thou’rt a fool, for my eldest son hada polt-foot,[216] crooked legs, a verjuice face, and apear-coloured beard: I made him a scholar, and he made himself afool. Sirrah, thou there: hold out thy hand.[216] Club foot._Duke._ My hand? well, here ’tis._1st Mad._ Look, look, look, look! has he not long nails, andshort hair?_Flu._ Yes, monstrous short hair, and abominable long nails._1st Mad._ Ten penny nails, are they not?_Flu._ Yes, ten-penny nails._1st Mad._ Such nails had my second boy. Kneel down, thouvarlet, and ask thy father’s blessing. Such nails had mymiddlemost son, and I made him a promoter:[217] and he scraped,and scraped, and scraped, till he got the devil and all: but hescraped thus, and thus, and thus, and it went under his legs,till at length a company of kites, taking him for carrion,swept up all, all, all, all, all, all, all. If you love yourlives, look to yourselves: see, see, see, see, the Turks’galleys are fighting with my ships! Bounce go the guns! Oooh!cry the men! Rumble, rumble, go the waters! Alas, there; ’tissunk, ’tis sunk: I am undone, I am undone! You are the damnedpirates have undone me: you are, by the Lord, you are, you are!Stop ’em--you are![217] Informer._Ans._ Why, how now sirrah! must I fall to tame you?_1st Mad._ Tame me! no, I’ll be madder than a roasted cat. See,see, I am burnt with gunpowder,--these are our close fights!_Ans._ I’ll whip you, if you grow unruly thus._1st Mad._ Whip me? Out you toad! Whip me? What justice is this,to whip me because I am a beggar? Alas! I am a poor man: a verypoor man! I am starved, and have had no meat by this light, eversince the great flood; I am a poor man._Ans._ Well, well, be quiet, and you shall have meat._1st Mad._ Ay, ay, pray do; for look you, here be my guts: theseare my ribs--you may look through my ribs--see how my guts comeout! These are my red guts, my very guts, oh, oh!_Ans._ Take him in there. [Servants _remove_ 1st Madman._Flu., Pio., &c._ A very piteous sight._Cas._ Father, I see you have a busy charge._Ans._ They must be used like children, pleased with toys,And anon whipped for their unruliness:I’ll show you now a pair quite differentFrom him that’s gone: he was all words; and theseUnless you urge ’em, seldom spend their speech,But save their tongues.[_Opens another door, from which enter ~2nd~ and_ 3rd Madmen.La, you; this hithermostFell from the happy quietness of mind,About a maiden that he loved, and died:He followed her to church, being full of tears,And as her body went into the ground,He fell stark mad. This is a married man,Was jealous of a fair, but, as some say,A very virtuous wife; and that spoiled him._3rd Mad._ All these are whoremongers, and lay with my wife:whore, whore, whore, whore, whore!_Flu._ Observe him._3rd Mad._ Gaffer shoemaker, you pulled on my wife’s pumps,and then crept into her pantofles:[218] lie there, liethere! This was her tailor. You cut out her loose-bodiedgown, and put in a yard more than I allowed her; lie thereby the shoemaker. O master doctor! are you here? you gave mea purgation, and then crept into my wife’s chamber, to feelher pulses, and you said, and she said, and her maid said,that they went pit-a-pat, pit-a-pat, pit-a-pat. Doctor, I’llput you anon into my wife’s urinal. Heigh, come aloft, Jack:this was her schoolmaster, and taught her to play upon thevirginals, and still his jacks leapt up, up.[219] You prickedher out nothing but bawdy lessons, but I’ll prick you all,fiddler--doctor--tailor--shoemaker--shoemaker--fiddler--doctor--tailor!So! lie with my wife again, now.[218] Slippers. Fr. _pantoufles_.[219] In playing the virginal the sound ceased whenever the jackfell and touched the string._Cas._ See how he notes the other, now he feeds._3rd Mad._ Give me some porridge._2nd Mad._ I’ll give thee none._3rd Mad._ Give me some porridge._2nd Mad._ I’ll not give thee a bit._3rd Mad._ Give me that flap-dragon.[220][220] A flap-dragon was a raisin floating on lighted spiritin a dish or glass and had to be snatched out with the mouthand swallowed. Gallants used to toast their mistresses inflap-dragons._2nd Mad._ I’ll not give thee a spoonful: thou liest, it’s nodragon, ’tis a parrot, that I bought for my sweetheart, and I’llkeep it._3rd Mad._ Here’s an almond for parrot._2nd Mad._ Hang thyself!_3rd Mad._ Here’s a rope for parrot.[221][221] “An almond for parrot,” and “a rope for parrot,” werecommon phrases at the time._2nd Mad._ Eat it, for I’ll eat this._3rd Mad._ I’ll shoot at thee, an thou’t give me none._2nd Mad._ Wu’t thou?_3rd Mad._ I’ll run a tilt at thee, an thou’t give me none._2nd Mad._ Wu’t thou? do an thou darest._3rd Mad._ Bounce! [_Strikes him.__2nd Mad._ O--oh! I am slain! murder, murder, murder! I amslain; my brains are beaten out._Ans._ How now, you villains! Bring me whips: I’ll whip you._2nd Mad._ I am dead! I am slain! ring out the bell, for I amdead._Duke._ How will you do now, sirrah? you ha’ killed him._3rd Mad._ I’ll answer’t at sessions: he was eating ofalmond-butter, and I longed for’t: the child had never beendelivered out of my belly, if I had not killed him. I’llanswer’t at sessions, so my wife may be burnt i’ th’ hand, too._Ans._ Take ’em in both: bury him, for he’s dead._2nd Mad._ Indeed, I am dead; put me, I pray, into a goodpit-hole._3rd Mad._ I’ll answer’t at sessions. [_~Servants~ remove ~2nd~and ~3rd Madmen~.__Enter_ BELLAFRONT._Ans._ How now, huswife, whither gad you?_Bell._ A-nutting, forsooth: how do you, gaffer? how do you,gaffer? there’s a French curtsey for you, too._Flu._ ’Tis Bellafront!_Pio._ Tis the punk, by th’ Lord!_Duke._ Father, what’s she, I pray?_Ans._ As yet I know not,She came in but this day; talks little idly,And therefore has the freedom of the house._Bell._ Do not you know me?--nor you?--nor you?--nor you?_All._ No, indeed._Bell._ Then you are an ass,--and you an ass,--and you are anass,--for I know you._Ans._ Why, what are they? come, tell me, what are they?_Bell._ They’re fish-wives, will you buy any gudgeons?

I’ll begin withthe little friar[224] first. Here’s a fine hand, indeed! I neversaw friar have such a dainty hand: here’s a hand for a lady!Here’s your fortune:--[224] _i.e._ Infelice.You love a friar better than a nun;Yet long you’ll love no friar, nor no friar’s son.Bow a little, the line of life is out, yet I’m afraid,For all you’re holy, you’ll not die a maid.God give you joy!Now to you, Friar Tuck._Mat._ God send me good luck!_Bell._ You love one, and one loves you:You’re a false knave, and she’s a Jew,Here is a dial that false ever goes--_Mat._ O your wit drops!_Bell._ Troth, so does your nose--Nay lets shake hands with you too; pray open, here’s a fine hand!Ho friar, ho! God be here,So he had need: you’ll keep good cheer,Here’s a free table,[225] but a frozen breast,For you’ll starve those that love you best;Yet you have good fortune, for if I’m no liar,Then you are no friar, nor you, nor you no friar,Haha, haha!      [_Discovers them._[225] A quibble. “Table” also meant the palm of thehand.--_Dyce.__Duke._ Are holy habits cloaks for villany?Draw all your weapons!_Hip._ Do; draw all your weapons._Duke._ Where are your weapons? draw!_Cas._, _Pio._, _&c._ The friar has gulled us of ’em._Mat._ O rare trick!You ha’ learnt one mad point of arithmetic._Hip._ Why swells your spleen so high? against what bosomWould you your weapons draw? her’s? ’tis your daughter’s:Mine? ’tis your son’s._Duke._ Son?_Mat._ Son, by yonder sun._Hip._ You cannot shed blood here but ’tis your own;To spill your own blood were damnation:Lay smooth that wrinkled brow, and I will throwMyself beneath your feet:Let it be ruggèd still and flinted ore,What can come forth but sparkles, that will burnYourself and us? She’s mine; my claim’s most good;She’s mine by marriage, though she’s yours by blood._Ans._ [_Kneeling._] I have a hand, dear lord, deep in this act,For I foresaw this storm, yet willinglyPut forth to meet it. Oft have I seen a fatherWashing the wounds of his dear son in tears,A son to curse the sword that struck his father,Both slain i’ th’ quarrel of your families.Those scars are now ta’en off; and I beseech youTo seal our pardon! All was to this end,To turn the ancient hates of your two housesTo fresh green friendship, that your loves might lookLike the spring’s forehead, comfortably sweet:And your vexed souls in peaceful union meet,Their blood will now be yours, yours will be their’s,And happiness shall crown your silver hairs._Flu._ You see, my lord, there’s now no remedy._Cas._, _Pio._, _&c._ Beseech your lordship!_Duke._ You beseech fair, you have me in place fitTo bridle me--Rise friar, you may be gladYou can make madmen tame, and tame men mad,Since Fate hath conquered, I must rest content,To strive now, would but add new punishment:I yield unto your happiness; be blest,Our families shall henceforth breathe in rest._All._ Oh, happy change!_Duke._ Your’s now is my content,I throw upon your joys my full consent._Bell._ Am not I a good girl, for finding the friar in thewell? God’s-so, you are a brave man: will not you buy me somesugar-plums, because I am so good a fortune-teller?_Duke._ Would thou hadst wit, thou pretty soul, to ask,As I have will to give._Bell._ Pretty soul? a pretty soul is better than a pretty body:do not you know my pretty soul? I know you: Is not your nameMatheo?_Mat._ Yes, lamb._Bell._ Baa lamb! there you lie, for I am mutton.[226]--Look,fine man! he was mad for me once, and I was mad for him once,and he was mad for her once, and were you never mad? Yes, Iwarrant; I had a fine jewel once, a very fine jewel, and thatnaughty man stole it away from me,--a very fine and a rich jewel.[226] _i.e._ A wench, a prostitute._Duke._ What jewel, pretty maid?_Bell._ Maid? nay, that’s a lie: O, ’twas a very rich jewel,called a maidenhead, and had not you it, leerer?_Mat._ Out, you mad ass! away._Duke._ Had he thy maidenhead?He shall make thee amends, and marry thee._Bell._ Shall he? O brave Arthur of Bradley[227] then?[227] An allusion to a ballad of that name._Duke._ And if he bear the mind of a gentleman,I know he will._Mat._ I think I rifled her of some such paltry jewel._Duke._ Did you? Then marry her; you see the wrongHas led her spirits into a lunacy._Mat._ How? marry her, my lord? ’Sfoot, marry a madwoman? Leta man get the tamest wife he can come by, she’ll be mad enoughafterward, do what he can._Duke._ Nay then, Father Anselmo here shall do his best,To bring her to her wits; and will you then?_Mat._ I cannot tell, I may choose._Duke._ Nay, then, law shall compel: I tell you, sir,So much her hard fate moves me, you should not breatheUnder this air, unless you married her._Mat._ Well, then, when her wits stand in their right place,I’ll marry her._Bell._ I thank your grace.--Matheo, thou art mine:I am not mad, but put on this disguise,Only for you, my lord; for you can tellMuch wonder of me, but you are gone: farewell.Matheo, thou didst first turn my soul black,Now make it white again: I do protest,I’m pure as fire now, chaste as Cynthia’s breast._Hip._ I durst be sworn, Matheo, she’s indeed._Mat._ Cony-catched, gulled, must I sail in your fly-boat,Because I helped to rear your main-mast first?Plague ’found[228] you for’t, ’tis well.The cuckold’s stamp goes current in all nations,Some men ha’ horns giv’n them at their creations,If I be one of those, why so: ’tis betterTo take a common wench, and make her good,Than one that simpers, and at first will scarceBe tempted forth over the threshold door,Yet in one se’nnight, zounds, turns arrant whore!Come wench, thou shalt be mine, give me thy golls,[229]We’ll talk of legs hereafter.--See, my lord,God give us joy![228] _i.e._ Confound.[229] Hands._All._ God give you joy!_Enter_ VIOLA _and_ GEORGE._Geo._ Come mistress, we are in Bedlam now; mass and see, wecome in pudding-time, for here’s the duke._Vio._ My husband, good my lord._Duke._ Have I thy husband?_Cast._ It’s Candido, my lord, he’s here among the lunatics:Father Anselmo, pray fetch him forth. [_Exit_ ANSELMO.]This mad woman is his wife, and though she were not with child,yet did she long most spitefully to have her husband mad: andbecause she would be sure he should turn Jew, she placed himhere in Bethlem. Yonder he comes._Enter_ ANSELMO _with_ CANDIDO._Duke._ Come hither, signor; are you mad?_Cand._ You are not mad._Duke._ Why, I know that._Cand._ Then may you know I am not mad, that knowYou are not mad, and that you are the duke:None is mad here but one.--How do you, wife?What do you long for now?--Pardon, my lord:She had lost her child’s nose else: I did cut outPennyworths of lawn, the lawn was yet mine own:A carpet was my gown, yet ’twas mine own:I wore my man’s coat, yet the cloth mine own:Had a cracked crown, the crown was yet mine own.She says for this I’m mad: were her words true,I should be mad indeed: O foolish skill![230]Is patience madness? I’ll be a madman still.[230] _i.e._ Reason._Vio._ Forgive me, and I’ll vex your spirit no more.      [_Kneels.__Duke._ Come, come, we’ll have you friends; join hearts, joinhands._Cand._ See, my lord, we are even,--Nay rise, for ill deeds kneel unto none but Heaven._Duke._ Signor, methinks patience has laid on youSuch heavy weight, that you should loathe it----_Cand._ Loathe it!_Duke._ For he whose breast is tender, blood so cool,That no wrongs heat it, is a patient fool:What comfort do you find in being so calm?_Cand._ That which green wounds receive from sovereign balm,Patience, my lord! why, ’tis the soul of peace;Of all the virtues, ’tis nearest kin to Heaven.It makes men look like gods. The best of menThat e’er wore earth about him, was a sufferer,A soft, meek, patient, humble, tranquil spirit,The first true gentleman that ever breathed.The stock of patience then cannot be poor;All it desires, it has; what monarch more?It is the greatest enemy to lawThat can be; for it doth embrace all wrongs,And so chains up lawyers and women’s tongues.’Tis the perpetual prisoner’s liberty,His walks and orchards: ’tis the bond slave’s freedom,And makes him seem proud of each iron chain,As though he wore it more for state than pain:It is the beggars’ music, and thus sings,Although their bodies beg, their souls are kings.O my dread liege! It is the sap of blissRears us aloft, makes men and angels kiss.And last of all, to end a household strife,It is the honey ’gainst a waspish wife._Duke._ Thou giv’st it lively colours: who dare sayHe’s mad, whose words march in so good array?’Twere sin all women should such husbands have,For every man must then be his wife’s slave.Come, therefore, you shall teach our court to shine,So calm a spirit is worth a golden mine,Wives with meek husbands that to vex them long,In Bedlam must they dwell, else dwell they wrong.

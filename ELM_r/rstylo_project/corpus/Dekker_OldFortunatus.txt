Author: Thomas DekkerTitle: _THE PLEASANT COMEDY OFOLD FORTUNATUS.__THE Pleasant Comedy of Old Fortunatus_ was first published in1600, having been produced at Court on the Christmas before.The play as it stands is an amplification and a recast of anearlier play, _The First Part of Fortunatus_, which had beenperformed at Henslowe’s Theatre about four years previously.This had long been laid aside, when the idea seems to haveoccurred to Henslowe to revive it in fuller form, and Dekkerwas commissioned to write a second part, with the result thathe recast the whole in one play instead, adding the episode ofthe sons of Fortunatus to the original version. So far, thewhole play was taken from the same source, the old _Volksbuch_of “Fortunatus,” which, first published at Augsburg in 1509,was popular in various languages in the sixteenth century.An interesting account of this legend and of its connectionwith the play, is given in Professor Herford’s “Studies in theLiterary Relations of England and Germany in the SixteenthCentury,” from which the present note on the play is largelydrawn. When Dekker had completed his recast of the play, itwas immediately ordered for performance at Court, and furtherscenes, in this case altogether extraneous to the originalstory--those, namely, in which Virtue and Vice are introduced asrivals to Fortune--were added with a special view to this end.Otherwise the play is pretty faithful to the story, even in itsabsurdities. It is worth mention that Hans Sachs had alreadydramatized the subject in 1553, which may have had something todo indirectly with the production of the first English version.In the original quarto of 1600, _Old Fortunatus_ is not dividedinto acts and scenes, and the division is here attempted forthe first time. It has been necessary also in some instances tosupply stage directions.THE PROLOGUE AT COURT.[329][329] This Prologue and the Epilogue are specially devised forthe performance of the play before the queen, hence “At Court.”_Enter ~Two Old Men~.__1st O. Man._ Are you then travelling to the temple ofEliza?[330][330] _i.e._ Queen Elizabeth, at this time in her sixty-eighthyear.Pandora is the only one of these poetic terms for Elizabethpeculiar to Dekker. The rest of them are used by others of theElizabethan poets. He evidently here conceives Pandora on theside of her good fortune only, as receiving the gifts of thegods, and not in her more familiar association with the story ofPandora’s Box and its evils._2nd O. Man._ Even to her temple are my feeble limbs travelling.Some call her Pandora: some Gloriana, some Cynthia: someDelphœbe, some Astræa: all by several names to express severalloves: yet all those names make but one celestial body, as allthose loves meet to create but one soul._1st O. Man._ I am one of her own country, and we adore her bythe name of Eliza._2nd O. Man._ Blessed name, happy country: your Eliza makes yourland Elysium: but what do you offer?_1st O. Man._ That which all true subjects should: when I wasyoung, an armed hand; now I am crooked, an upright heart: butwhat offer you?_2nd O. Man._ That which all strangers do: two eyes struck blindwith admiration: two lips proud to sound her glory: two handsheld up full of prayers and praises: what not, that may expresslove? what not, that may make her beloved?_1st O. Man._ How long is’t since you last beheld her?_2nd O. Man._ A just year: yet that year hath seemed to me butone day, because her glory hath been my hourly contemplation,and yet that year hath seemed to me more than twice seven years,because so long I have been absent from her. Come therefore,good father, let’s go faster, lest we come too late: for see,the tapers of the night are already lighted, and stand brightlyburning in their starry candle-sticks: see how gloriously themoon shines upon us. [_Both kneel.__1st O. Man._ Peace, fool: tremble, and kneel: the moon say’st thou?Our eyes are dazzled by Eliza’s beams,See (if at least thou dare see) where she sits:This is the great Pantheon of our goddess,And all those faces which thine eyes thought stars,Are nymphs attending on her deity.Prithee begin, for I want power to speak._2nd O. Man._ No, no, speak thou, I want words to begin.      [_Weeps.__1st O. Man._ Alack, what shall I do? com’st thou with me,And weep’st now thou behold’st this majesty?_2nd O. Man._ Great landlady of hearts, pardon me._1st O. Man._ Blame not mine eyes, good father, in these tears._2nd O. Man._ My pure love shines, as thine doth in thy fears:I weep for joy to see so many headsOf prudent ladies, clothed in the liveryOf silver-handed age, for serving you,Whilst in your eyes youth’s glory doth renew:I weep for joy to see the sun look old,To see the moon mad at her often change,To see the stars only by night to shine,Whilst you are still bright, still one, still divine:I weep for joy to see the world decay,Yet see Eliza flourishing like May:O pardon me your pilgrim, I have measuredMany a mile to find you: and have broughtOld Fortunatus and his family,With other Cypriots, my poor countrymen,To pay a whole year’s tribute: O vouchsafe,Dread Queen of Fairies, with your gracious eyes,T’accept theirs and our humble sacrifice._1st O. Man._ Now I’ll beg for thee too: and yet I need not:Her sacred hand hath evermore been known,As soon held out to strangers as her own._2nd O. Man._ Thou dost encourage me: I’ll fetch them in,They have no princely gifts, we are all poor,Our offerings are true hearts, who can wish more?      [_Exeunt._[Illustration: PROLOGUE.]Of Love’s sweet war our timorous Muse doth sing,And to the bosom of each gentle dear,Offers her artless tunes, borne on the wingOf sacred poesy. A benumbing fear,That your nice souls, cloyed with delicious sounds,Will loath her lowly notes, makes her pull inHer fainting pinions, and her spirit confounds,Before the weak voice of her song begin.Yet since within the circle of each eye,Being like so many suns in his round sphere,No wrinkle yet is seen, she’ll dare to fly,Borne up with hopes, that as you oft do rearWith your fair hands, those who would else sink down,So some will deign to smile, where all might frown:And for this small circumference must stand,For the imagined surface of much land,Of many kingdoms, and since many a mileShould here be measured out, our Muse entreatsYour thoughts to help poor art, and to allowThat I may serve as Chorus to her senses;She begs your pardon, for she’ll send one forth,Not when the laws of poesy do call,But as the story needs; your gracious eyeGives life to Fortunatus’ history.

So, ho, ho, ho, ho._Echo_ [_Within._]. Ho, ho, ho, ho._Fort._ There, boy._Echo._ There, boy._Fort._ An thou bee’st a good fellow, tell me how call’st thiswood._Echo._ This wood._Fort._ Ay, this wood, and which is my best way out._Echo._ Best way out._Fort._ Ha, ha, ha, that’s true, my best way out is my best wayout, but how that out will come in, by this maggot I know not.I see by this we are all worms’ meat. Well, I am very poor andvery patient; Patience is a virtue: would I were not virtuous,that’s to say, not poor, but full of vice, that’s to say, fullof chinks. Ha, ha, so I am, for I am so full of chinks, thata horse with one eye may look through and through me. I havesighed long, and that makes me windy; I have fasted long, andthat makes me chaste; marry, I have prayed little, and thatmakes me I still dance in this conjuring circle; I have wanderedlong, and that makes me weary. But for my weariness, anon I’lllie down, instead of fasting I’ll feed upon nuts, and instead ofsighing will laugh and be lean, Sirrah Echo._Echo._ Sirrah Echo._Fort._ Here’s a nut._Echo._ Here’s a nut._Fort._ Crack it._Echo._ Crack it._Fort._ Hang thyself._Echo._ Hang thyself._Fort._ Th’art a knave, a knave._Echo._ A knave, a knave._Fort._ Ha, ha, ha, ha!_Echo._ Ha, ha, ha, ha!_Fort._ Why so, two fools laugh at one another, I at my tittletattle gammer Echo, and she at me. Shortly there will creep outin print some filthy book of the old hoary wandering knight,meaning me: would I were that book, for then I should be sure tocreep out from hence. I should be a good soldier, for I traversemy ground rarely; marry I see neither enemy nor friends, butpopinjays, and squirrels, and apes, and owls, and daws, andwagtails, and the spite is that none of these grass-eaters canspeak my language, but this fool that mocks me, and swears tohave the last word, in spite of my teeth, ay, and she shallhave it because she is a woman, which kind of cattle are indeedall echo, nothing but tongue, and are like the great bell ofSt. Michael’s[331] in Cyprus, that keeps most rumbling when menwould most sleep. Echo, a pox on thee for mocking me.[331] Probably a church in Famagosta, which tradition makesFortunatus’s native place, and which was at one time the chiefport and fortress in Cyprus._Echo._ A pox on thee for mocking me._Fort._ Why so, Snip snap, this war is at an end, but thiswilderness is world without end. To see how travel cantransform: my teeth are turned into nutcrackers, a thousand toone I break out shortly, for I am full of nothing but waxenkernels, my tongue speaks no language but an almond for aparrot, and crack me this nut. If I hop three days more up anddown this cage of cuckoos’ nests, I shall turn wild man sure,and be hired to throw squibs among the commonalty upon someterrible day. In the meantime, to tell truth, here will I lie.Farewell, fool!_Echo._ Farewell, fool._Fort._ Are not these comfortable words to a wise man? All hail,signor tree, by your leave I’ll sleep under your leaves. I praybow to me, and I’ll bend to you, for your back and my browsmust, I doubt, have a game or two at noddy ere I wake again:down, great heart, down. Hey, ho, well, well. [_He lies down andsleeps.__Enter a ~Shepherd~, a ~Carter~,[332] a ~Tailor~,[333] and a~Monk~, all crowned; a ~Nymph~ with a globe, another with_FORTUNE’S _wheel; then_ FORTUNE. _Afterher, four ~Kings~ with broken crowns and sceptres, chainedin silver gyves and led by her. The foremost enter singing._FORTUNE _takes her chair, the ~Kings~ lying at her feetso that she treads on them as she ascends to her seat._[332] “A gardener” in the original, which does not tally withthe description given by Fortune on p. 300. _q.v._[333] “A smith” in the original, which is again a confusion withthe description in the text.SONG.Fortune smiles, cry holiday,Dimples on her cheeks do dwell,Fortune frowns, cry welladay,Her love is Heaven, her hate is Hell:Since Heaven and Hell obey her power.Tremble when her eyes do lower,Since Heaven and Hell her power obey,When she smiles, cry holiday.  Holiday with joy we cry  And bend, and bend, and merrily  Sing hymns to Fortune’s deity,  Sing hymns to Fortune’s deity._Chorus._ Let us sing, merrily, merrily, merrily,With our song let Heaven resound,Fortune’s hands our heads have crowned;Let us sing merrily, merrily, merrily._1st King._ Accursed Queen of chance, what had we done,Who having sometimes like young Phaeton,Rid in the burnished chariot of the sun,And sometimes been thy minions, when thy fingersWeaved wanton love-nets in our curlèd hair,And with sweet juggling kisses warmed our cheeks:Oh how have we offended thy proud eyes,That thus we should be spurned and trod upon,Whilst those infected limbs of the sick world,Are fixed by thee for stars in that bright sphere,Wherein our sun-like radiance did appear._The Kings._ Accursèd Queen of chance, damned sorceress._The Others._ Most powerful Queen of chance, dread sovereigness._Fortune._ No more: curse on! your cries to me are music,And fill the sacred rondure of mine earsWith tunes more sweet than moving of the spheres:Curse on: on our celestial brows do sitUnnumbered smiles, which then leap from their throne,When they see peasants dance and monarchs groan.Behold you not this globe, this golden bowl,This toy called world, at our imperial feet?This world is Fortune’s ball, wherewith she sports.Sometimes I strike it up into the air,And then create I emperors and kings:Sometimes I spurn it, at which spurn crawls outThat wild beast Multitude. Curse on, you fools,--’Tis I that tumble princes from their thrones,And gild false brows with glittering diadems.’Tis I that tread on necks of conquerors,And when, like demi-gods, they have been drawnIn ivory chariots to the capitol,Circled about with wonder of all eyes,The shouts of every tongue, love of all hearts,Being swoll’n with their own greatness, I have prickedThe bladder of their pride, and made them die,As water-bubbles, without memory.I thrust base cowards into Honour’s chair,Whilst the true-spirited soldier stands byBare-headed, and all bare, whilst at his scarsThey scoff, that ne’er durst view the face of wars.I set an idiot’s cap on Virtue’s head,[334]Turn Learning out of doors, clothe Wit in rags,And paint ten thousand images of loamIn gaudy silken colours. On the backsOf mules and asses I make asses ride,Only for sport, to see the apish worldWorship such beasts with sound idolatry.This Fortune does, and when this is done,She sits and smiles to hear some curse her name,And some with adoration crown her fame.[334] An allusion to the coxcomb, the invariable ornament to thefool’s cap, which Virtue wears on her head. See description,Scene III._Monk._ True centre of this wide circumference,Sacred commandress of the destinies,Our tongues shall only sound thy excellence._The Others._ Thy excellence our tongues shall only sound._2nd King._ Thou painted strumpet, that with honeyed smiles,Openest the gates of Heaven and criest, “Come in;”Whose glories being seen, thou with one frown,In pride, lower than hell tumblest us down._The Kings._ Ever, for ever, will we ban thy name._Fortune._ How sweet your howlings relish in mine ears! [_She comes down._Stand by! now rise,--behold, here lies a wretch,To vex your souls, this beggar I’ll advanceBeyond the sway of thought; take instruments,And let the raptures of choice harmony,Thorough the hollow windings of his ear,Carry their sacred sounds, and wake each sense,To stand amazed at our bright eminence.      [_Music._ FORTUNATUS _wakes_._Fort._ Oh, how am I transported? Is this earth?Or blest Elysium?_Fortune._ Fortunatus, rise._Fort._ Dread goddess, how should such a wretch as IBe known to such a glorious deity?Oh pardon me: for to this place I come,Led by my fate, not folly; in this woodWith weary sorrow have I wanderèd,And three times seen the sweating sun take rest,And three times frantic Cynthia naked rideAbout the rusty highways of the skiesStuck full of burning stars, which lent her lightTo court her negro paramour grim Night._Fortune._ This travel now expires: yet from this circle,Where I and these with fairy troops abide,Thou canst not stir, unless I be thy guide.I the world’s empress am, Fortune my name,This hand hath written in thick leaves of steelAn everlasting book of changeless fate,Showing who’s happy, who unfortunate._Fort._ If every name, dread queen, be there writ downI am sure mine stands in characters of black;Though happiness herself lie in my name,I am Sorrow’s heir, and eldest son to Shame._The Kings._ No, we are sons to Shame, and Sorrow’s heirs._Fortune._ Thou shalt be one of Fortune’s minions:Behold these four chained like Tartarian slaves,These I created emperors and kings,And these are now my basest underlings:This sometimes was a German emperor,Henry the Fifth,[335] who being first deposed,Was after thrust into a dungeon,And thus in silver chains shall rot to death.This Frederick Barbarossa, EmperorOf Almaine[336] once: but by Pope Alexander[337]Now spurned and trod on when he takes his horse,And in these fetters shall he die his slave.This wretch once wore the diadem of France,Lewis the meek,[338] but through his children’s pride,Thus have I caused him to be famishèd.Here stands the very soul of misery,Poor Bajazet, old Turkish Emperor,And once the greatest monarch in the East;[339]Fortune herself is said to view thy fall,And grieves to see thee glad to lick up crumbsAt the proud feet of that great Scythian swain,Fortune’s best minion, warlike Tamburlaine:Yet must thou in a cage of iron be drawnIn triumph at his heels, and there in griefDash out thy brains.[335] The description corresponds rather to Henry IV. ofGermany, who died in 1106.[336] Frederick I. called Barbarossa, Emperor of Germany, _i.e._Allemagne (Almaine), the grandson of Henry IV.[337] Alexander III.[338] Louis I. called Le Débonnaire, son of Charlemagne, d. 840.[339] Bajazet I. called Yilderim, _i.e._ Lightning, becauseof the rapidity of his movement in the field of war, firstSultan of the Ottoman Empire, who was humiliated by Timur(Tamburlaine). Compare Marlowe’s _Tamburlaine the Great_._4th King._ Oh miserable me!_Fortune._ No tears can melt the heart of destiny:These have I ruined and exalted those.These hands have conquered Spain, these brows fill upThe golden circle of rich Portugal,--Viriat a monarch now, but born a shepherd;[340]This Primislaus, a Bohemian king,Last day a carter;[341] this monk, Gregory,[342]Now lifted to the Papal dignity;--Wretches,[343] why gnaw you not your fingers off,And tear your tongues out, seeing yourselves trod down,And this Dutch botcher[344] wearing Munster’s crown,John Leyden,[345] born in Holland poor and base,Now rich in empery and Fortune’s grace?As these I have advanced, so will I thee.Six gifts I spend upon mortality,Wisdom, strength, health, beauty, long life, and riches,Out of my bounty: one of these is thine,--Choose then which likes thee best.[340] Viriathus, a shepherd who became a famous Lusitanian chiefin the 2nd century B.C., and long warred successfullyagainst the Romans in Spain.[341] Primislaus, a country labourer, who became first Duke ofBohemia, having married the daughter of Croc who founded thecity of Prague.[342] Gregory VII. (1013-1085).[343] Fortune here turns and addresses the four deposed kingsagain.[344] Tailor. See _The Devil’s Answer to Pierce Pennylesse_(Dekker’s non-dramatic works, The Huth Library, edited by theRev. A. B. Grosart, vol. ii. p. 147), “That botcher I preferredto be Lucifer’s tailor, because he works with a hot needle andburnt thread.”[345] John of Leyden (John Beccold), b. 1510, d. 1536, a tailor,who became a leader of the Anabaptists and at their head tookextraordinary possession of the city of Munster, and ruled for abrief space as king there, before constitutional authority wasrestored and he was seized and put to death._Fort._ Oh most divine!Give me but leave to borrow wonder’s eye,To look amazed at thy bright majesty,Wisdom, strength, health, beauty, long life, and riches._Fortune._ Before thy soul at this deep lotteryDraw forth her prize, ordained by destiny,Know that here’s no recanting a first choice.Choose then discreetly for the laws of Fate,Being graven in steel, must stand inviolate._Fort._ Daughters of Jove and the unblemished Night,Most righteous Parcae,[346] guide my genius right,Wisdom, strength, health, beauty, long life, and riches.[346] The Three Destinies, to whom Fortune herself was sometimesadded as a fourth. Fortunatus here seems to be addressingFortune and her two attendant nymphs, for no stage direction isspecially given for the entrance of the Three Destinies, as inAct II. sc. ii., _q.v.__Fortune._ Stay, Fortunatus, once more hear me speak;If thou kiss Wisdom’s cheek and make her thine,She’ll breathe into thy lips divinity,And thou like Phœbus shalt speak oracle,Thy Heaven-inspired soul, on Wisdom’s wings,Shall fly up to the Parliament of Jove,And read the statutes of eternity,And see what’s past and learn what is to come.If thou lay claim to strength, armies shall quakeTo see thee frown: as kings at mine do lie,So shall thy feet trample on empery.Make health thine object, thou shalt be strong proof’Gainst the deep searching darts of surfeiting,Be ever merry, ever revelling.Wish but for beauty, and within thine eyesTwo naked Cupids amorously shall swim,[347]And on thy cheeks I’ll mix such white and red,That Jove shall turn away young Ganymede,And with immortal arms shall circle thee.Are thy desires long life?--thy vital threadShall be stretched out, thou shalt behold the changeOf monarchies and see those children die,Whose great great grandsires now in cradles lie.If through gold’s sacred hunger thou dost pine,Those gilded wantons which in swarms do run,To warm their tender bodies in the sun,Shall stand for number of those golden piles,Which in rich pride shall swell before thy feet;As those are, so shall these be infinite.Awaken then thy soul’s best faculties,And gladly kiss this bounteous hand of Fate,Which strives to bless thy name of Fortunate.[347] See an anonymous poem in _Tottel’s Miscellany_, 1557,called “A praise of his Lady,” from which Dekker may haveborrowed the fancy:--“In each of her two crystal eyesSmileth a naked boy.”_The Kings._ Old man, take heed, her smiles will murder thee._The Others._ Old man, she’ll crown thee with felicity._Fort._ Oh, whither am I rapt beyond myself?More violent conflicts fight in every thought,Than his whose fatal choice Troy’s downfall wrought.Shall I contract myself to wisdom’s love?Then I lose riches: and a wise man poor,Is like a sacred book that’s never read,--To himself he lives, and to all else seems dead.This age thinks better of a gilded fool,Than of a threadbare saint in wisdom’s school.I will be strong: then I refuse long life,And though mine arm should conquer twenty worlds,There’s a lean fellow beats all conquerors:The greatest strength expires with loss of breath;The mightiest in one minute stoop to death.Then take long life, or health: should I do soI might grow ugly, and that tedious scrollOf months and years, much misery may enrollTherefore I’ll beg for beauty; yet I will not,That fairest cheek hath oftentimes a soulLeprous as sin itself; than hell more foul.The wisdom of this world is idiotism,Strength a weak reed: health sickness’ enemy,And it at length will have the victory.Beauty is but a painting, and long lifeIs a long journey in December gone,Tedious and full of tribulation.Therefore, dread sacred Empress, make me rich,   [_Kneels down._My choice is store of gold; the rich are wise.He that upon his back rich garments wears,Is wise, though on his head grow Midas’ ears.Gold is the strength, the sinews of the world,The health, the soul, the beauty most divine,A mask of gold hides all deformities;Gold is Heaven’s physic, life’s restorative,Oh therefore make me rich: not as the wretch,That only serves lean banquets to his eye,Has gold, yet starves: is famished in his store:No, let me ever spend, be never poor._Fortune._ Thy latest words confine thy destiny,Thou shalt spend ever, and be never poor:For proof receive this purse: with it this virtueStill when thou thrust thy hand into the same,Thou shalt draw forth ten pieces of bright gold,Current in any realm where then thou breathest;If thou canst dribble out the sea by drops,Then shalt thou want: but that can ne’er be done,Nor this grow empty._Fort._ Thanks, great deity._Fortune._ The virtue ends when thou and thy sons end.This path leads thee to Cyprus,[348] get thee hence;Farewell, vain covetous fool, thou wilt repent,That for the love of dross thou hast despisedWisdom’s divine embrace, she would have borne theeOn the rich wings of immortality;But now go dwell with cares and quickly die.[348] Dekker is not careful even to remember here that Cyprusis an island._The Kings._ We dwell with cares, yet cannot quickly die.[_Exeunt all singing, except_ FORTUNATUS._Fort._ But now go dwell with cares and quickly die? Howquickly? if I die to-morrow, I’ll be merry to-day: if next day,I’ll be merry to-morrow. Go dwell with cares? Where dwellsCare? Hum ha, in what house dwells Care, that I may choose anhonester neighbour? In princes’ courts? No. Among fair ladies?Neither: there’s no care dwells with them, but care how to bemost gallant. Among gallants then? Fie, fie, no! Care is afraidsure of a gilt rapier, the scent of musk is her prison, tobaccochokes her, rich attire presseth her to death. Princes, fairladies and gallants, have amongst you then, for this wet-eyedwench Care dwells with wretches: they are wretches that feelwant, I shall feel none if I be never poor; therefore, Care, Icashier you my company. I wonder what blind gossip this minxis that is so prodigal; she should be a good one by her opendealing: her name’s Fortune: it’s no matter what she is, so shedoes as she says. “Thou shalt spend ever, and be never poor.”Mass, yet I feel nothing here to make me rich:--here’s no sweetmusic with her silver sound. Try deeper: ho God be here: ha, ha,one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine and ten,good, just ten. It’s gold sure, it’s so heavy, try again, one,two, &c. Good again, just ten, and just ten. Ha, ha, ha, thisis rare: a leather mint, admirable: an Indian mine in a lamb’sskin, miraculous! I’ll fill three or four bags full for my sons,but keep this for myself. If that lean tawny face tobacconistDeath, that turns all into smoke, must turn me so quickly intoashes, yet I will not mourn in ashes, but in music, hey, oldlad, be merry. Here’s riches, wisdom, strength, health, beauty,and long life (if I die not quickly). Sweet purse, I kiss thee;Fortune, I adore thee; Care, I despise thee; Death, I defythee.[349] [_Exit._[349] Compare Shakespeare’s “Crabbed Age and Youth.”SCENE II.--_Outside the House of_ FORTUNATUS._Enter_ AMPEDO, SHADOW _after him, both sad: then_ ANDELOCIA._Andel._ ’Sheart,[350] why how now: two knights of the post?[351][350] A corruption of “God’s heart.”[351] Hired witnesses._Shad._ Ay, master, and we are both forsworn, as all such woodenknights be, for we both took an oath--marry it was not corporal,you may see by our cheeks, that we would not fast twenty-fourhours to amend, and we have tasted no meat since the clock toldtwo dozen._Andel._ That lacks not much of twenty-four, but I wonder whenthat half-faced moon of thine will be at the full._Shad._ The next quarter, not this, when the sign is in Taurus._Andel._ Ho, that’s to say, when thou eat’st bull beef.But, Shadow, what day is to-day?_Shad._ Fasting day._Andel._ What day was yesterday?_Shad._ Fasting day too._Andel._ Will to-morrow be so too?_Shad._ Ay, and next day too._Andel._ That will be rare, you slave:For a lean diet makes a fat wit._Shad._ I had rather be a fool and wear a fat pair of cheeks._Andel._ Now I am prouder of this poverty, which I know is mineown, than a waiting gentlewoman is of a frizzled groatsworth ofhair, that never grew on her head. Sir Shadow, now we can allthree swear like Puritans at one bare word: this want makes uslike good bowlers, we are able to rub out and shift in everyplace._Shad._ That’s not so, we have shifted ourselves in no placethis three months: marry, we rub out in every corner, but herefollows no amendment either of life or of livery._Andel._ Why, brother Ampedo, art thou not yet tired with ridingpost? Come, come, ’light from this logger-headed jade, and walkafoot, and talk with your poor friends._Shad._ Nay, by my troth, he is like me: if his belly be empty,his heart is full._Andel._ The famine of gold gnaws his covetous stomach, morethan the want of good victuals: thou hast looked very devilishlyever since the good angel[352] left thee: come, come, leave thisbroad-brim fashions; because the world frowns upon thee, wiltnot thou smile upon us?[352] One of the usual puns on the coin of that name._Amp._ Did but the bitterness of mine own fortunesInfect my taste, I could paint o’er my cheeksWith ruddy-coloured smiles: ’tis not the wantOf costly diet or desire of goldEnforces rupture in my wounded breast.Oh no, our father--if he live--doth lieUnder the iron foot of misery,And, as a dove gripped in a falcon’s claw,There pant’th for life being most assured of death.Brother, for him my soul thus languisheth._Shad._ ’Tis not for my old master that I languish._Amp._ I am not enamoured of this painted idol,This strumpet World; for her most beauteous looksAre poisoned baits, hung upon golden hooks:When fools do swim in wealth, her Cynthian beamsWill wantonly dance on the silver streams;But when this squint-eyed age sees Virtue poor,And by a little spark sits shivering,Begging at all, relieved at no man’s door,She smiles on her, as the sun shines on fire,To kill that little heat, and, with her little frown,Is proud that she can tread poor Virtue down:Therefore her wrinkled brow makes not mine sour,Her gifts are toys, and I desire her power._Shad._ ’Tis not the crab-tree faced World neither that makesmine sour._Andel._ Her gifts toys! Well, brother Virtue, we have let slipthe ripe plucking of those toys so long, that we flourish likeapple-trees in September, which, having the falling sickness,bear neither fruit nor leaves._Shad._ Nay, by my troth, master, none flourish in thesewithering times, but ancient bearers[353] and trumpeters.[353] Ensign-bearers._Andel._ Shadow, when thou provest a substance, then the treeof virtue and honesty, and such fruit of Heaven, shall flourishupon earth._Shad._ True; or when the sun shines at midnight, or women fly,and yet they are light enough._Andel._ ’Twas never merry world with us, since purses and bagswere invented, for now men set lime-twigs to catch wealth: andgold, which riseth like the sun out of the East Indies, to shineupon every one, is like a cony taken napping in a pursenet,[354]and suffers his glistering yellow-face deity to be lapped up inlambskins, as if the innocency of those leather prisons shoulddispense with the cheveril[355] consciences of the iron-heartedgaolers.[354] A net the ends of which are drawn together with a stringlike a purse.[355] Kid leather (Fr. _chevreau_). Hence a very flexibleconscience was often called a cheveril conscience.--_Halliwell.__Shad._ Snudges[356] may well be called gaolers: for if apoor wretch steal but into a debt of ten pound, they lead himstraight to execution.[356] Mean or miserly persons.--_Halliwell.__Andel._ Doth it not vex thee, Shadow, to stalk up and downCyprus, and to meet the outside of a man, lapped all in damask,his head and beard as white as milk, only with conjuring inthe snowy circles of the field argent, and his nose as red asscarlet, only with kissing the ruddy lips of angels,[357] andsuch an image to wear on his thumb, three men’s livings in theshape of a seal ring, whilst my brother Virtue here,--[357] See note _ante_, p. 306._Shad._ And you his brother Vice!_Andel._ Most true, my little lean Iniquity--whilst we three, ifwe should starve, cannot borrow five shillings of him neither inword nor deed: does not this vex thee, Shadow?_Shad._ Not me; it vexes me no more to see such a picture, thanto see an ass laden with riches, because I know when he can bearno longer, he must leave his burthen to some other beast._Andel._ Art not thou mad, to see money on goldsmiths’ stalls,and none in our purses?_Shad._ It mads not me, I thank the destinies._Andel._ By my poverty, and that’s but a thread-bare oath, I ammore than mad to see silks and velvets lie crowding together inmercers’ shops, as in prisons, only for fear of the smell ofwax--they cannot abide to see a man made out of wax, for thesesatin commodities have such smooth consciences that they’ll haveno man give his word for them or stand bound for their comingforth, but vow to lie till they rot in those shop counters,except Monsieur Money bail them. Shadow, I am out of my littlewits to see this._Shad._ So is not Shadow: I am out of my wits, to see fatgluttons feed all day long, whilst I that am lean fast everyday: I am out of my wits, to see our Famagosta fools turn halfa shop of wares into a suit of gay apparel, only to make otheridiots laugh, and wise men to cry, who’s the fool now? I ammad, to see soldiers beg, and cowards brave: I am mad, to seescholars in the broker’s shop, and dunces in the mercer’s:I am mad, to see men that have no more fashion in them thanpoor Shadow, yet must leap thrice a day into three orders offashions: I am mad, to see many things, but horn-mad, that mymouth feels nothing._Andel._ Why now, Shadow, I see thou hast a substance:I am glad to see thee thus mad._Amp._ The sons of Fortunatus had not wontThus to repine at others’ happiness:But fools have always this loose garment wore,Being poor themselves, they wish all others poor.Fie, brother Andelocia, hate this madness,Turn your eyes inward, and behold your soul,That wants more than your body; burnish thatWith glittering virtue, and make idiots grieveTo see your beauteous mind in wisdom shine,As you at their rich poverty repine._Enter_ FORTUNATUS, _gallant_.[358][358] _i.e._ Gallantly attired._Andel._ Peace, good Virtue; Shadow, here comes another shadow._Shad._ It should be a chameleon: for he is all in colours._Amp._ Oh, ’tis my father. With these tears of joy,My love and duty greet your fair return!A double gladness hath refreshed my soul;One, that you live, and one, to see your fateLooks freshly howsoever poor in state._Andel._ My father Fortunatus, and thus brave?_Shad._ ’Tis no wonder to see a man brave, but a wonder how hecomes brave._Fort._ Dear Andelocia and son Ampedo,And my poor servant Shadow, plume your spiritsWith light-winged mirth; for Fortunatus’ handCan now pour golden showers into their lapsThat sometimes scorned him for his want of gold.Boys, I am rich, and you shall ne’er be poor;Wear gold, spend gold, we all in gold will feed,Now is your father Fortunate indeed._Andel._ Father, be not angry, if I set open the windows ofmy mind: I doubt for all your bragging, you’ll prove like mostof our gallants in Famagosta, that have a rich outside and abeggarly inside, and like mules wear gay trappings, and goodvelvet foot-cloths[359] on their backs, yet champ on the ironbit of penury--I mean, want coin. You gild our ears with a talkof gold, but I pray dazzle our eyes with the majesty of it.[359] Housings hung on horses and mules, and considered a markof dignity.--_Halliwell.__Fort._ First will I wake your senses with the soundOf gold’s sweet music: tell me what you hear?_Amp._ Believe me, sir, I hear not any thing._Andel._ Ha, ha, ha. ’Sheart, I thought as much; if I hear anyjingling, but of the purse strings that go flip flap, flip flap,flip flap, would I were turned into a flip-flap,[360] and soldto the butchers![360] A stick with leather flap for killing flies._Fort._ Shadow, I’ll try thine ears; hark, dost rattle?_Shad._ Yes, like three blue beans in a blue bladder, rattlebladder, rattle: your purse is like my belly, th’ one’s withoutmoney, th’ other without meat._Fort._ Bid your eyes blame the error of your ears:You misbelieving pagans, see, here’s gold--Ten golden pieces: take them, Ampedo.Hold, Andelocia, here are ten for thee._Amp._ Shadow, there’s one for thee, provide thee food._Fort._ Stay, boy: hold, Shadow, here are ten for thee._Shad._ Ten, master? then defiance to fortune, and a fig forfamine._Fort._ Now tell me, wags, hath my purse gold or no?_Andel._ We the wags have gold, father; but I think there’s notone angel more wagging in this sacred temple. Why, this is rare:Shadow, five will serve thy turn, give me th’ other five._Shad._ Nay, soft, master, liberality died long ago. I see somerich beggars are never well, but when they be craving: my tenducats are like my ten fingers, they will not jeopard a jointfor you. I am yours, and these are mine; if I part from them, Ishall never have part of them._Amp._ Father, if Heaven have blest you once again,Let not an open hand disperse that store,Which gone, life’s gone; for all tread down the poor._Fort._ Peace, Ampedo, talk not of poverty.Disdain, my boys, to kiss the tawny cheeksOf lean necessity: make not inquiryHow I came rich; I am rich, let that suffice.There are four leathern bags trussed full of gold:Those spent, I’ll fill you more. Go, lads, be gallant:Shine in the streets of Cyprus like two stars,And make them bow their knees that once did spurn you;For, to effect such wonders, gold can turn you.Brave it in Famagosta, or elsewhere;I’ll travel to the Turkish Emperor,And then I’ll revel it with Prester John,[361]Or banquet with great Cham[362] of Tartary,And try what frolic court the Soldan keeps.I’ll leave you presently. Tear off these rags;Glitter, my boys, like angels,[363] that the worldMay, whilst our life in pleasure’s circle roams,Wonder at Fortunatus and his sons.[361] One of the followers of Ogier the Dane into India,according to Mandeville, who was given sovereignty there, and issaid by tradition to have had seventy tributary kings.[362] _i.e._ Khan.[363] Another reference to the gold coins so called._Andel._ Come, Shadow, now we’ll feast it royally._Shad._ Do, master, but take heed of beggary.      [_Exeunt._SCENE III.--_A Wood in Cyprus.__Music sounds. Enter_ VICE _with a gilded face, andhorns on her head; her garments long, painted before with silverhalf-moons, increasing by little and little till they come tothe full; while in the midst of them is written in capitalletters, “~Crescit Eundo~.” Behind her garments are painted withfools’ faces and heads; and in the midst is written, “~Ha, Ha,He~.” She, and others wearing gilded vizards and attired likedevils, bring out a fair tree of gold with apples on it.__After her comes_ VIRTUE, _with a coxcomb on her head,and her attire all in white before; about the middle is written“~Sibi sapit~.” Her attire behind is painted with crowns andlaurel garlands, stuck full of stars held by hands thrust outof bright clouds, and among them is written, “~Dominabiturastris~.” She and other nymphs, all in white with coxcombs ontheir heads, bring a tree with green and withered leaves mingledtogether, and with little fruit on it.__After her comes_ FORTUNE, _with two ~Nymphs~, onebearing her wheel, another her globe_._And last, the ~Priest~.__Fortune._ You ministers of Virtue, Vice, and Fortune,Tear off this upper garment of the earth,And in her naked bosom stick these trees._Virtue._ How many kingdoms have I measured,Only to find a climate, apt to cherishThese withering branches? But no ground can proveSo happy; ay me, none do Virtue love.I’ll try this soil; if here I likewise fade,To Heaven I’ll fly, from whence I took my birth,And tell the Gods, I am banished from the earth._Vice._ Virtue, I am sworn thy foe: if there thou plant,Here, opposite to thine, my tree shall flourish,And as the running wood-bine spreads her arms,To choke thy withering boughs in their embrace,I’ll drive thee from this world: were Virtue fled,Vice as an angel should be honourèd._Fortune._ Servants of this bright devil and that poor saint,Apply your task whilst you are labouring:To make your pains seem short our priest shall sing.[_Whilst the ~Priest~ sings, the rest set the trees into theearth._SONG.Virtue’s branches wither, Virtue pines,  O pity, pity, and alack the time,Vice doth flourish, Vice in glory shines,  Her gilded boughs above the cedar climb.Vice hath golden cheeks, O pity, pity,  She in every land doth monarchize.Virtue is exiled from every city,  Virtue is a fool, Vice only wise.O pity, pity, Virtue weeping dies.  Vice laughs to see her faint,--alack the time.This sinks; with painted wings the other flies:  Alack that best should fall, and bad should climb.  O pity, pity, pity, mourn, not sing,  Vice is a saint, Virtue an underling.  Vice doth flourish, Vice in glory shines,  Virtue’s branches wither, Virtue pines._Fortune._ Flourish or wither, Fortune cares not which,In either’s fall or height our eminenceShines equal to the sun: the Queen of chanceBoth virtuous souls and vicious doth advance.These shadows of yourselves shall, like yourselves,Strive to make men enamoured of their beauties;This grove shall be our temple, and henceforthBe consecrated to our deities._Virtue._ How few will come and kneel at Virtue’s shrine?_Vice._ This contents Virtue, that she is called divine._Fortune._ Poor Virtue, Fortune grieves to see thy looksWant cunning to entice: why hang these leaves,As loose as autumn’s hair which every windIn mockery blows from his rotten brows?Why like a drunkard art thou pointed at?Why is this motley-scorn[364] set on thy head?Why stands thy court wide open, but none in it?Why are the crystal pavements of thy temple,Not worn, not trod upon? All is for this,Because thy pride is to wear base attire,Because thine eyes flame not with amorous fire.[364] _i.e._ The fool’s cap._Virtue._ Virtue is fairest in a poor array._Fortune._ Poor fool, ’tis not this badge of purity,Nor _Sibi sapit_, painted on thy breast,Allures mortality to seek thy love.No: now the great wheel of thy globe hath run,And met this first point of creation.On crutches went this world but yesterday,Now it lies bed-rid, and is grown so old,That it’s grown young; for ’tis a child again,A childish soul it hath, ’tis a mere fool:And fools and children are well pleased with toys.So must this world, with shows it must be pleased,Then, Virtue, buy a golden face like Vice,And hang thy bosom full of silver moons,To tell the credulous world, As those increase,As the bright moon swells in her pearlèd sphere,So wealth and pleasures them to Heaven shall rear._Virtue._ Virtue abhors to wear a borrowed face._Vice._ Why hast thou borrowed, then, that idiot’s hood?_Virtue._ Fools placed it on my head that knew me not,And I am proud to wear the scorn of fools._Fortune._ Mourn in that pride and die, all the world hates thee._Virtue._ Not all, I’ll wander once more through the world:Wisdom I know hath with her blessèd wingsFled to some bosom: if I meet that breast,There I’ll erect my temple, and there rest.Fortune nor Vice shall then e’er have the powerBy their loose eyes to entice my paramour.Then will I cast off this deformity,And shine in glory, and triumph to seeYou conquered at my feet, that tread on me._Fortune._ Virtue begins to quarrel: Vice, farewell._Vice._ Stay, Fortune, whilst within this grove we dwell,If my angelical and saint-like formCan win some amorous fool to wanton here,And taste the fruit of this alluring tree,Thus shall his saucy brows adornèd be,To make us laugh.      [_Makes horns.__Fortune._ It will be rare: adieu._Virtue._ Foul, hell-bred fiend, Virtue shall strive with you,If any be enamoured of thine eyes,Their love must needs beget deformities.Men are transformed to beasts, feasting with sin;But if in spite of thee their souls I win,To taste this fruit, though thou disguise their head,Their shapes shall be re-metamorphosèd._Vice._ I dare thee do thy worst._Virtue._ My best I’ll try._Fort._ Fortune shall judge who wins the sovereignty.      [_Exeunt._ACT THE SECOND_Enter ~Chorus~._Chorus. The world to the circumference of HeavenIs as a small point in geometry,Whose greatness is so little, that a lessCannot be made: into that narrow room,Your quick imaginations we must charm,To turn that world: and turned, again to part itInto large kingdoms, and within one momentTo carry Fortunatus on the wingsOf active thought, many a thousand miles.Suppose then, since you last beheld him here,That you have sailed with him upon the seas,And leapt with him upon the Asian shores,Been feasted with him in the Tartar’s palace,And all the courts of each barbarian king:From whence being called by some unlucky star,--For happiness never continues long,Help me to bring him back to Arragon,Where for his pride--riches make all men proud--On slight quarrel, by a covetous Earl,Fortune’s dear minion is imprisonèd.There think you see him sit with folded arms,Tears dropping down his cheeks, his white hairs torn,His legs in rusty fetters, and his tongueBitterly cursing that his squint-eyed soulDid not make choice of wisdom’s sacred love.Fortune, to triumph in inconstancy,From prison bails him: liberty is wild,For being set free, he like a lusty eagleCut with his vent’rous feathers through the sky,And ’lights not till he find the Turkish court.Thither transport your eyes, and there behold him,Revelling with the Emperor of the East,From whence through fear, for safeguard of his life,Flying into the arms of ugly Night,Suppose you see him brought to Babylon;And that the sun clothed all in fire hath ridOne quarter of his hot celestial wayWith the bright morning, and that in this instant,He and the Soldan meet, but what they say,Listen you--the talk of kings none dare bewray.      [_Exit._SCENE I.--_The Court at Babylon._[365][365] In the original story Fortunatus goes to Cairo, and Dekkeris evidently here confusing Egypt with Assyria. Hence theSoldan’s court at Babylon._Enter the_ SOLDAN, _~Noblemen~, and_ FORTUNATUS.Sold. Art thou that Fortunatus, whose great name,Being carried in the chariot of the winds,Hast filled the courts of all our Asian kingsWith love and envy, whose dear presence tiesThe eyes of admiration to thine eyes?Art thou that Jove that in a shower of goldAppeared’st before the Turkish Emperor?_Fort._ I am that Fortunatus, mighty Soldan._Sold._ Where is that purse which threw abroad such treasure?_Fort._ I gave it to the Turkish Soliman,A second I bestowed on Prester John,A third the great Tartarian Cham received:For with these monarchs have I banqueted,And rid with them in triumph through their courts,In crystal chariots drawn by unicorns.England, France, Spain, and wealthy Belgia,And all the rest of Europe’s blessed daughters,Have made my covetous eye rich in th’ embraceOf their celestial beauties; now I comeTo see the glory of fair Babylon.Is Fortunatus welcome to the Soldan?For I am like the sun, if Jove once chide,My gilded brows from amorous Heaven I hide._Sold._ Most welcome, and most happy are mine armsIn circling such an earthly deity;But will not Fortunatus make me blessedBy sight of such a purse?_Fort._ Ere I depart,The Soldan shall receive one at my hands:For I must spend some time in framing it,And then some time to breathe that virtuous spiritInto the heart thereof, all which is doneBy a most sacred inspiration._Sold._ Welcome, most welcome to the Soldan’s court;Stay here and be the King of Babylon:Stay here, I will more amaze thine eyesWith wondrous sights, than can all Asia.Behold yon town, there stands mine armoury,In which are corselets forged of beaten gold,To arm ten hundred thousand fighting men,Whose glittering squadrons when the sun beholds,They seem like to ten hundred thousand Joves,When Jove on the proud back of thunder rides,Trapped all in lightning flames: there can I show theeThe ball of gold that set all Troy on fire;[366]There shalt thou see the scarf of Cupid’s mother,Snatched from the soft moist ivory of her arm,To wrap about Adonis’ wounded thigh;There shalt thou see a wheel of Titan’s care,Which dropped from Heaven when Phaeton fired the world:[367]I’ll give thee, if thou wilt, two silver dovesComposed by magic to divide the air,Who, as they fly, shall clap their silver wings,And give strange music to the elements;I’ll give thee else the fan of Proserpine,Which in reward for a sweet Thracian song,The black-browed Empress threw to Orpheus,Being come to fetch Eurydice from hell.[366] The golden apple which Paris adjudged to Venus.[367] Alluding to Phaeton’s flight, and the fiery disruption ofhis chariot._Fort._ Hath ever mortal eye beheld these wonders?_Sold._ Thine shall behold them, and make choice of any,So thou wilt give the Soldan such a purse._Fort._ By Fortune’s blessèd hand, who christened me,The mighty Soldan shall have such a purse,Provided I may see these priceless wonders._Sold._ Leave us alone: [_Exeunt ~Nobles~._] never was mortal earAcquainted with the virtue of a jewel,Which now I’ll show, out-valuing all the rest._Fort._ It is impossible._Sold._ Behold this casket,     [_Draws a curtain._Fettered in golden chains, the lock pure gold,The key of solid gold, which myself keep,And here’s the treasure that’s contained in it.[_Takes out the hat.__Fort._ A coarse felt hat? is this the precious jewel?_Sold._ I’ll not exchange this for ten diadems.On pain of death, none listen to our talk._Fort._ What needs this solemn conjuration!_Sold._ O, yes, for none shall understand the worthOf this inestimable ornament,But you: and yet not you, but that you swearBy her white hand, that lent you such a name,To leave a wondrous purse in Babylon._Fort._ What I have sworn, I will not violate,But now uncover the virtues of this hat._Sold._ I think none listen; if they do, they die._Fort._ None listen: tell, what needs this jealousy?_Sold._ You see ’tis poor in show; did I want jewels,Gold could beget them, but the wide world’s wealthBuys not this hat: this clapped upon my head,I, only with a wish, am through the airTransported in a moment over seasAnd over lands to any secret place;By this I steal to every prince’s court,And hear their private counsels and preventAll dangers which to Babylon are meant;By help of this I oft see armies join,Though when the dreadful Alvarado[368] sounds,I am distant from the place a thousand leagues.Oh, had I such a purse and such a hat,The Soldan were, of all, most fortunate.[368] A martial term, probably of Spanish derivation, for thesummons to battle._Fort._ Oh, had I such a hat, then were I brave.Where’s he that made it?_Sold._ Dead, and the whole worldYields not a workman that can frame the like._Fort._ No, does’t?[369] By what trick shall I make this      mine?      [_Aside._Methinks, methinks, when you are borne o’er seas,And over lands, the heaviness thereofShould weigh you down, drown you, or break your neck.[369] “No does?” simply in the original, which is notintelligible. In full it would seem to imply “No, does it not?”_Sold._ No, ’tis more light than any hat beside:Your hand shall peise[370] it.[370] Poise, weigh. “Peise” is still in use in some parts of thenorth of England._Fort._ Oh, ’tis wondrous heavy._Sold._ Fie, y’are deceived: try it upon your head._Fort._ Would I were now in Cyprus with my sons.      [_Exit.__Sold._ Stay! Fortunatus, stay! I am undone.Treason, lords, treason, get me wings, I’ll flyAfter this damnèd traitor through the air._Re-enter ~Nobles~.__Nobles._ Who wrongs the mighty King of Babylon?_Sold._ This Fortunatus, this fiend, wrongs your king._Nobles._ Lock the court gates, where is the devil hid?_Sold._ No gates, no grates of iron imprison him,Like a magician breaks he through the clouds,Bearing my soul with him, for that jewel gone,I am dead, and all is dross in Babylon.Fly after him!--’tis vain: on the wind’s wings,He’ll ride through all the courts of earthly kings._Nobles._ What is the jewel that your grace hath lost?_Sold._ He dies that troubles me: call me not king;For I’ll consume my life in sorrowing.      [_Exeunt._SCENE II.--_Outside the House of_ FORTUNATUS._Enter_ ANDELOCIA, _very gallant,[371] and_ SHADOW.[371] _i.e._ Gallantly attired._Andel._ Shadow? what have I lost to-day at dice?_Shad._ More than you will win again in a month._Andel._ Why, sir, how much comes it to?_Shad._ It comes to nothing, sir, for you have lost your wits;and when a man’s wits are lost, the man is like twenty pounds’worth of tobacco, which mounts into th’ air, and proves nothingbut one thing._Andel._ And what thing is that, you ass?_Shad._ Marry, sir, that he is an ass that melts so much moneyin smoke._Andel._ ’Twere a charitable deed to hang thee a smoking._Shad._ I should never make good bacon, because I am not fat._Andel._ I’ll be sworn thy wit is lean._Shad._ It’s happy I have a lean wit: but, master, you havenone; for when your money tripped away, that went after it, andever since you have been mad. Here comes your brother._Enter_ AMPEDO.Borrow a dram of him, if his be not mouldy: for men’s wits inthese days are like the cuckoo, bald once a year, and that makesmotley so dear, and fools so good cheap._Andel._ Brother, all hail._Shad._ There’s a rattling salutation._Andel._ You must lend me some more money. Nay, never look sostrange, an you will come off, so; if you will bar me fromsquare play, do. Come, come, when the old traveller my fathercomes home, like a young ape, full of fantastic tricks, or apainted parrot stuck full of outlandish feathers, he’ll leadthe world in a string, and then like a hot shot I’ll charge anddischarge all._Shad._ I would be loth, master, to see that day: for he leadsthe world in a string that goes to hanging._Andel._ Take heed I turn not that head into the world, and lead you so.Brother wilt be? Ha’ ye any ends of gold or silver?_Amp._ Thus wanton revelling breeds beggary.Brother, ’twere better that you still lived poor.Want would make wisdom rich: but when your coffersSwell to the brim, then riot sets up sails,And like a desperate unskilled marinerDrives your unsteady fortunes on the pointOf wreck inevitable. Of all the wealthLeft by our father, when he left us last,This little is unspent, and this being wasted,Your riot ends; therefore consume it all.I’ll live; or dying, find some burial._Andel._ Thanks for my crowns.[372] Shadow, I am villainoushungry, to hear one of the seven wise masters talk thus emptily.[372] In the original these words ate assigned to Ampedo, anevident error._Shad._ I am a villain, master, if I am not hungry._Andel._ Because I’ll save this gold, sirrah Shadow, we’ll feedourselves with paradoxes._Shad._ Oh rare: what meat’s that?_Andel._ Meat, you gull: ’tis no meat: a dish of paradoxes isa feast of strange opinion, ’tis an ordinary that our greatestgallants haunt nowadays, because they would be held forstatesmen._Shad._ I shall never fill my belly with opinions._Andel._ In despite of sway-bellies, gluttons, and sweet mouthedepicures, I’ll have thee maintain a paradox in commendations ofhunger._Shad._ I shall never have the stomach to do’t._Andel._ See’st thou this crusado?[373] do it, and turn thisinto a feast.[373] A Portuguese coin having a cross on one side and worthabout 2_s._ 3_d._, but varying in value at different times._Shad._ Covetousness and lechery are two devils, they’ll tempta man to wade through deep matters: I’ll do’t though good cheerconspire my death, for speaking treason against her._Andel._ Fall to it then with a full mouth._Shad._ Oh famine, inspire me with thy miserable reasons.I begin, master._Amp._ O miserable invocation._Andel._ Silence!_Shad._ There’s no man but loves one of these three beasts, ahorse, a hound, or a whore; the horse by his goodwill has hishead ever in the manger; the whore with your ill will has herhand ever in your purse; and a hungry dog eats dirty puddings._Andel._ This is profound, forward: the conclusion of this now._Shad._ The conclusion is plain: for since all men love one ofthese three monsters, being such terrible eaters, therefore allmen love hunger._Amp._ A very lean argument._Shad._ I can make it no fatter._Andel._ Proceed, good Shadow; this fats me._Shad._ Hunger is made of gunpowder._Andel._ Give fire to that opinion._Shad._ Stand by, lest it blow you up. Hunger is made ofgunpowder, or gunpowder of hunger, for they both eat throughstone walls; hunger is a grindstone, it sharpens wit; hungeris fuller of love than Cupid, for it makes a man eat himself;hunger was the first that ever opened a cook shop, cooks thefirst that ever made sauce, sauce being liquorish, licks up goodmeat; good meat preserves life: hunger therefore preserves life._Amp._ By my consent thou shouldst still live by hunger._Shad._ Not so, hunger makes no man mortal: hunger is anexcellent physician, for he dares kill any body. Hunger is oneof the seven liberal sciences._Andel._ Oh learned! Which of the seven?_Shad._ Music, for she’ll make a man leap at a crust; but as fewcare for her six sisters, so none love to dance after her pipe.Hunger, master, is hungry and covetous; therefore the crusado._Andel._ But hast thou no sharper reasons than this?_Shad._ Yes, one: the dagger of Cyprus had never stabbed outsuch six penny pipes, but for hunger._Andel._ Why, you dolt, these pipes[374] are but in theirminority.[374] “Pies” in the original, an evident misprint._Shad._ My belly and my purse have been twenty times at dagger’sdrawing, with parting the little urchins._Enter_ FORTUNATUS._Amp._ Peace, idiot, peace, my father is returned._Fort._ Touch me not, boys, I am nothing but air; let none speakto me, till you have marked me well._Shad._ (_Chalking_ FORTUNATUS’ _back_.) Now speak yourmind._Amp._ Villain, why hast thou chalked my father’s back?_Shad._ Only to mark him, and to try what colour air is of._Fort._ Regard him not, Ampedo: Andelocia, Shadow, view me, am Ias you are, or am I transformed?_Andel._ I thought travel would turn my father madman or fool._Amp._ How should you be transformed? I see no change._Shad._ If your wits be not planet stricken, if your brains liein their right place, you are well enough; for your body islittle mended by your fetching vagaries._Andel._ Methinks, father, you look as you did, only your faceis more withered._Fort._ That’s not my fault; age is like love, it cannot be hid._Shad._ Or like gunpowder a-fire, or like a fool, or like ayoung novice new come to his lands: for all these will show ofwhat house they come. Now, sir, you may amplify._Fort._ Shadow, turn thy tongue to a shadow, be silent! Boys,be proud, your father hath the whole world in this compass, Iam all felicity, up to the brims. In a minute am I come fromBabylon, I have been this half-hour in Famagosta._Andel._ How? in a minute, father? Ha, ha, I see travellers mustlie._Shad._ ’Tis their destiny: the Fates do so conspire._Fort._ I have cut through the air like a falcon; I would haveit seem strange to you._Shad._ So it does, sir._Fort._ But ’tis true: I would not have you believe it neither._Shad._ No more we do not, sir._Fort._ But ’tis miraculous and true. Desire to see you, broughtme to Cyprus. I’ll leave you more gold, and go visit morecountries._Shad._ Leave us gold enough, and we’ll make all countries comevisit us._Amp._ The frosty hand of age now nips your blood,And strews her snowy flowers upon your head,And gives you warning that within few years,Death needs must marry you: those short-lived minutes,That dribble out your life, must needs be spentIn peace, not travel: rest in Cyprus then.Could you survey ten worlds, yet you must die;And bitter is the sweet that’s reaped thereby._Andel._ Faith, father, what pleasure have you met by walkingyour stations?_Fort._ What pleasure, boy? I have revelled with kings, dancedwith queens, dallied with ladies, worn strange attires, seenfantasticos, conversed with humorists, been ravished with divineraptures of Doric, Lydian and Phrygian harmonies. I have spentthe day in triumphs, and the night in banqueting._Andel._ Oh rare: this was heavenly._Shad._ Methinks ’twas horrible._Andel._ He that would not be an Arabian phœnix to burn in thesesweet fires, let him live like an owl for the world to wonderat._Amp._ Why, brother, are not all these vanities?_Fort._ Vanities? Ampedo, thy soul is made of lead, too dull,too ponderous to mount up to the incomprehensible glory thattravel lifts men to._Shad._ My old master’s soul is cork and feathers, and being solight doth easily mount up._Andel._ Sweeten mine ears, good father, with some more._Fort._ When in the warmth of mine own country’s armsWe yawned like sluggards, when this small horizonImprisoned up my body, then mine eyesWorshipped these clouds as brightest; but, my boys,The glist’ring beams which do abroad appearIn other heavens,--fire is not half so clear._Shad._ Why, sir, are there other heavens in other countries?_Andel._ Peace; interrupt him not upon thy life._Fort._ For still in all the regions I have seen,I scorned to crowd among the muddy throngOf the rank multitude, whose thickened breath,Like to condensèd fogs, do choke that beauty,Which else would dwell in every kingdom’s cheek.No, I still boldly stept into their courts,For there to live ’tis rare, O ’tis divine;There shall you see faces angelical,There shall you see troops of chaste goddesses,Whose star-like eyes have power, might they still shine,To make night day, and day more crystalline.Near these you shall behold great heroes,White-headed counsellors and jovial spirits,Standing like fiery cherubims to guardThe monarch, who in god-like glory sitsIn midst of these, as if this deityHad with a look created a new world,The standers by being the fair workmanship._Andel._ Oh how my soul is rapt to a third heaven. I’ll travelsure, and live with none but kings._Shad._ Then Shadow must die among knaves; and yet why so? In abunch of cards, knaves wait upon the kings._Andel._ When I turn king, then shalt thou wait on me._Shad._ Well, there’s nothing impossible: a dog has his day, andso have you._Amp._ But tell me, father, have you in all courtsBeheld such glory, so majesticalIn all perfection, no way blemishèd?_Fort._ In some courts shall you see ambitionSit piercing Dedalus’ old waxen wings,But being clapped on, and they about to fly,Even when their hopes are busied in the clouds,They melt against the sun of majesty,And down they tumble to destruction:For since the Heaven’s strong arms teach kings to stand,Angels are placed about their glorious throne,To guard it from the strokes of trait’rous hands.By travel, boys, I have seen all these things.Fantastic compliment stalks up and down,Tricked in outlandish feathers, all his words,His looks, his oaths, are all ridiculous,All apish, childish, and Italianate.[375][375] A common reproach for the affectation of the courtiers inElizabeth’s reign._Enter_ FORTUNE _in the background: after her ~TheThree Destinies~,[376] working_.[376] See note _ante._ p. 301. “The Parcae were generallyrepresented as three old women with chaplets made with wool, andinterwoven with the flowers of the narcissus. They were coveredwith a white robe, and fillet of the same colour, bound withchaplets. One of them held a distaff, another the spindle, andthe third was armed with scissors with which she cut the threadwhich her sisters had spun.”--_Lempriere.__Shad._ I know a medicine for that malady._Fort._ By travel, boys, I have seen all these things._Andel._ And these are sights for none but gods and kings._Shad._ Yes, and for Christian creatures, if they be not blind._Fort._ In these two hands do I grip all the world.This leather purse, and this bald woollen hatMake me a monarch. Here’s my crown and sceptre!In progress will I now go through the world.I’ll crack your shoulders, boys, with bags of goldEre I depart; on Fortune’s wings I ride,And now sit in the height of human pride._Fortune._ (_Coming forward._) Now, fool, thou liest; where thy      proud feet do tread,These shall throw down thy cold and breathless head._Fort._ O sacred deity, what sin is done,That Death’s iron fist should wrestle with thy son?     [_All kneel.__Fortune._ Thou art no son of Fortune, but her slave:Thy cedar hath aspired to his full height.Thy sun-like glory hath advanced herselfInto the top of pride’s meridian,And down amain it comes. From beggaryI plumed thee like an ostrich, like that ostrichThou hast eaten metals, and abused my gifts,Hast played the ruffian, wasted that in riotsWhich as a blessing I bestowed on thee._Fort._ Forgive me, I will be more provident._Fortune._ No, endless follies follow endless wealth.Thou hadst thy fancy, I must have thy fate,Which is, to die when th’art most fortunate.This inky thread, thy ugly sins have spun,Black life, black death; faster! that it were done._Fort._ Oh, let me live, but till I can redeem._Fortune._ The Destinies deny thee longer life._Fort._ I am but now lifted to happiness._Fortune._ And now I take most pride to cast thee down.Hadst thou chosen wisdom, this black had been white,And Death’s stern brow could not thy soul affright._Fort._ Take this again! (_Offering the purse._) Give wisdom to my sons._Fortune._ No, fool, ’tis now too late: as death strikes thee,So shall their ends sudden and wretched be.Jove’s daughters--righteous Destinies--make haste!His life hath wasteful been, and let it waste.[_Exeunt_ FORTUNE _and ~The Three Destinies~_._Andel._ Why the pox dost thou sweat so?_Shad._ For anger to see any of God’s creatures have such filthyfaces as these sempsters[377] had that went hence.[377] Sempstresses, alluding to their spinning._Andel._ Sempsters? why, you ass, they are Destinies._Shad._ Indeed, if it be one’s destiny to have a filthy face, Iknow no remedy but to go masked and cry “Woe worth the Fates.”_Amp._ Why droops my father? these are only shadows,Raised by the malice of some enemy,To fright your life, o’er which they have no power._Shad._ Shadows? I defy their kindred._Fort._ O Ampedo, I faint; help me, my sons._Andel._ Shadow, I pray thee run and call more help._Shad._ If that desperate Don Dego[378] Death hath ta’en up thecudgels once, here’s never a fencer in Cyprus dare take my oldmaster’s part.[378] See _The Devil’s Answer to Pierce Pennylesse_, p. 100,“that great Dego of Devils.”--_Dekker’s Non-Dramatic Works.__Andel._ Run, villain, call more help._Shad._ Bid him thank the Destinies for this. [_Exit.__Fort._ Let me shrink down, and die between your arms,Help comes in vain. No hand can conquer fate,This instant is the last of my life’s date.This goddess, if at least she be a goddess,Names herself Fortune: wand’ring in a wood,Half famished, her I met. I have, quoth she,Six gifts to spend upon mortality,Wisdom, strength, health, beauty, long life and riches.Out of my bounty one of these is thine._Amp._ What benefit did from your choice arise?_Fort._ Listen, my sons! in this small compass liesInfinite treasure: this she gave to me,And gave to this, this virtue, Take, quoth she,So often as from hence thou draw’st thy hand,Ten golden pieces of that kingdom’s coin,Where’er thou liv’st; which plenteous sure shall last,After thy death, till thy sons’ lives do waste._Andel._ Father, your choice was rare, the gift divine._Fort._ It had been so, if riches had been mine._Amp._ But hath this golden virtue never failed?_Fort._ Never._Andel._ O admirable: here’s a fireHath power to thaw the very heart of death,And give stones life; by this most sacred breath,[379]See brother, here’s all India in my hand.[379] Death, in original,--an evident misprint._Fort._ Inherit you, my sons, that golden land.This hat I brought away from Babylon,I robbed the Soldan of it, ’tis a prizeWorth twenty empires in this jewel lies._Andel._ How, father? jewel? call you this a jewel? it’s coarsewool, a bald fashion, and greasy to the brim; I have bought abetter felt for a French crown forty times: of what virtuousblock is this hat, I pray?_Fort._ Set it upon thy head, and wish a wish,Thou in the moment, on the wind’s swift wings,Shalt be transported into any place._Andel._ A wishing hat, and a golden mine?_Fort._ O Andelocia, Ampedo, now DeathSounds his third summons, I must hence! These jewelsTo both I do bequeath; divide them not,But use them equally: never bewrayWhat virtues are in them; for if you do,Much shame, much grief, much danger follows you.Peruse this book; farewell! behold in meThe rotten strength of proud mortality.      [_Dies.__Amp._ His soul is wandering to the Elysian shades._Andel._ The flower that’s fresh at noon, at sunset fades.Brother, close you down his eyes, because you were his eldest;and with them close up your tears, whilst I as all youngerbrothers do, shift for myself: let us mourn, because he’s dead,but mourn the less, because he cannot revive. The honour we cando him, is to bury him royally; let’s about it then, for I’llnot melt myself to death with scalding sighs, nor drop my soulout at mine eyes, were my father an emperor._Amp._ Hence, hence, thou stop’st the tide of my true tears.True grief is dumb, though it hath open ears._Andel._ Yet God send my grief a tongue, that I may have goodutterance for it: sob on, brother mine, whilst you sigh there,I’ll sit and read what story my father has written here.[_They both fall asleep_: FORTUNE _and acompany of ~Satyrs~ enter with music, and playing about_FORTUNATUS’ _body, take it away. Afterwards_SHADOW _enters running_._Shad._ I can get none, I can find none: where are you, master?Have I ta’en you napping? and you too? I see sorrow’s eye-lidsare made of a dormouse skin, they seldom open, or of a miser’spurse, that’s always shut. So ho, master._Andel._ Shadow, why how now? what’s the matter?_Shad._ I can get none, sir, ’tis impossible._Amp._ What is impossible? what canst not get?_Shad._ No help for my old master._Andel._ Hast thou been all this while calling for help?_Shad._ Yes, sir: he scorned all Famagosta when he was in hishuffing,[380] and now he lies puffing for wind, they say theyscorn him.[380] Swaggering mood._Amp._ The poison of their scorn infects not him;He wants no help. See where he breathless lies:Brother, to what place have you borne his body?_Andel._ I bear it? I touched it not._Amp._ Nor I: a leaden slumber pressed mine eyes._Shad._ Whether it were lead or latten[381] that hasped downthose winking casements, I know not, but I found you bothsnorting.[381] Ital. _Latta_, tin-plate._Amp._ And in that sleep, methought, I heard the tunesOf sullen passions apt for funerals,And saw my father’s lifeless body borneBy Satyrs: O I fear that deityHath stolen him hence!--that snudge, his destiny._Andel._ I fear he’s risen again; didst not thou meet him?_Shad._ I, sir? do you think this white and red durst havekissed my sweet cheeks, if they had seen a ghost? But, master,if the Destinies, or Fortune, or the Fates, or the Fairies havestolen him, never indict them for the felony: for by this meansthe charges of a tomb is saved, and you being his heirs, may doas many rich executors do, put that money in your purses, andgive out that he died a beggar._Andel._ Away, you rogue, my father die a beggar!I’ll build a tomb for him of massy gold._Shad._ Methinks, master, it were better to let the memory ofhim shine in his own virtues, if he had any, than in alabaster._Andel._ I shall mangle that alabaster face, you whoresonvirtuous vice._Shad._ He has a marble heart, that can mangle a face ofalabaster._Andel._ Brother, come, come, mourn not; our father is butstepped to agree with Charon for his boat hire to Elysium. See,here’s a story of all his travels; this book shall come outwith a new addition: I’ll tread after my father’s steps; I’llgo measure the world, therefore let’s share these jewels, takethis, or this!_Amp._ Will you then violate our father’s will?_Andel._ A Puritan!--keep a dead man’s will? Indeed in the oldtime, when men were buried in soft church-yards, that theirghosts might rise, it was good: but, brother, now they areimprisoned in strong brick and marble, they are fast. Fear not:away, away, these are fooleries, gulleries, trumperies; here’sthis or this, or I am gone with both!_Amp._ Do you as you please, the sin shall not be mine. Foolscall those things profane that are divine._Andel._ Are you content to wear the jewels by turns? I’ll havethe purse for a year, you the hat, and as much gold as you’llask; and when my pursership ends, I’ll resign, and cap you._Amp._ I am content to bear all discontents. [_Exit.__Andel._ I should serve this bearing ass rarely now, if I shouldload him, but I will not. Though conscience be like physic,seldom used, for so it does least hurt, yet I’ll take a dram ofit. This for him, and some gold: this for me; for having thismint about me, I shall want no wishing cap. Gold is an eagle,that can fly to any place, and, like death, that dares enter allplaces. Shadow, wilt thou travel with me?_Shad._ I shall never fadge[382] with the humour because Icannot lie.[382] Succeed._Andel._ Thou dolt, we’ll visit all the kings’ courts in theworld._Shad._ So we may, and return dolts home, but what shall welearn by travel?_Andel._ Fashions.[383][383] Farcy, a disease to which horses are subject, stillsometimes miscalled “Fashions” by country farriers. Dekker punson it again in _The Gull’s Horn-Book_:--“Fashions then wascounted a disease, and horses died of it: But now (thanks tofolly) it is held the only rare physic, and the purest goldenAsses live upon it.”_Shad._ That’s a beastly disease: methinks it’s better stayingin your own country._Andel._ How? In mine own country--like a cage-bird, and seenothing?_Shad._ Nothing? yes, you may see things enough, for what canyou see abroad that is not at home? The same sun calls you up inthe morning, and the same man in the moon lights you to bed atnight; our fields are as green as theirs in summer, and theirfrosts will nip us more in winter: our birds sing as sweetly andour women are as fair: in other countries you shall have onedrink to you; whilst you kiss your hand, and duck,[384] he’llpoison you: I confess you shall meet more fools, and asses, andknaves abroad than at home. Yet God be thanked we have prettystore of all. But for punks,[385] we put them down.[384] Bow.[385] Prostitutes._Andel._ Prepare thy spirits, for thou shalt go with me.To England shall our stars direct our course;Thither the Prince of Cyprus, our king’s son,Is gone to see the lovely Agripyne.Shadow, we’ll gaze upon that English dame,And try what virtue gold has to inflame.First to my brother, then away let’s fly;Shadow must be a courtier ere he die.      [_Exit.__Shad._ If I must, the Fates shall be served: I have seen manyclowns courtiers, then why not Shadow? Fortune, I am for thee.[_Exit._ACT THE THIRD.SCENE I.--_London. The Court of_ ATHELSTANE._Enter_ ORLEANS _melancholy_, GALLOWAY _with him; a ~Boy~ after themwith a lute_.ORLE. Begone: leave that with me, and leave me to myself; if theking ask for me, swear to him I am sick, and thou shalt not lie;pray thee leave me._Boy._ I am gone, sir. [_Exit.__Orle._ This music makes me but more out of tune.O, Agripyne._Gall._ Gentle friend, no more.Thou sayest love is a madness, hate it then,Even for the name’s sake._Orle._ O, I love that madness,Even for the name’s sake._Gall._ Let me tame this frenzy,By telling thee thou art a prisoner here,By telling thee she’s daughter to a king,By telling thee the King of Cyprus’ sonShines like a sun, between her looks and thine,Whilst thou seem’st but a star to Agripyne:He loves her._Orle._ If he do: why so do I._Gall._ Love is ambitious, and loves majesty._Orle._ Dear friend, thou art deceived, love’s voice doth singAs sweetly in a beggar as a king._Gall._ Dear friend, thou art deceived: O bid thy soulLift up her intellectual eyes to Heaven,And in this ample book of wonders read,Of what celestial mould, what sacred essence,Herself is formed, the search whereof will driveSounds musical among the jarring spirits,And in sweet tune set that which none inherits._Orle._ I’ll gaze on Heaven if Agripyne be there:If not: fa, la, la, sol, la, &c._Gall._ O, call this madness in; see, from the windowsOf every eye derision thrusts out cheeks,Wrinkled with idiot laughter; every fingerIs like a dart shot from the hand of scorn,By which thy name is hurt, thine honour torn._Orle._ Laugh they at me, sweet Galloway?_Gall._ Even at thee._Orle._ Ha, ha, I laugh at them, are not they madThat let my true true sorrow make them glad?I dance and sing only to anger grief,That in that anger, he might smite life downWith his iron fist. Good heart, it seemeth then,They laugh to see grief kill me: O, fond men,You laugh at others’ tears; when others smile,You tear yourselves in pieces: vile, vile, vile!Ha, ha, when I behold a swarm of fools,Crowding together to be counted wise,I laugh because sweet Agripyne’s not there,But weep because she is not anywhere,And weep because whether she be or not,My love was ever, and is still, forgot: forgot, forgot, forgot._Gall._ Draw back this stream, why should my Orleans mourn?_Orle._ Look yonder, Galloway, dost thou see that sun?Nay, good friend, stare upon it, mark it well,Ere he be two hours older, all that gloryIs banished Heaven, and then for grief this sky,That’s now so jocund, will mourn all in black,And shall not Orleans mourn? Alack, alack!O what a savage tyranny it wereT’enforce care laugh, and woe not shed a tear!Dead is my love, I am buried in her scorn,That is my sunset, and shall I not mourn?Yes, by my troth I will._Gall._ Dear friend, forbear,Beauty, like sorrow, dwelleth everywhere.Rase out this strong idea of her face,As fair as hers shineth in any place._Orle._ Thou art a traitor to that white and red,Which, sitting on her cheeks, being Cupid’s throne,Is my heart’s sovereign: O, when she is dead,This wonder, beauty, shall be found in none.Now Agripyne’s not mine, I vow to beIn love with nothing but deformity.O fair Deformity, I muse all eyesAre not enamoured of thee: thou didst neverMurder men’s hearts, or let them pine like wax,Melting against the sun of destiny;Thou art a faithful nurse to chastity;Thy beauty is not like to Agripyne’s,For cares, and age, and sickness hers deface,But thine’s eternal. O Deformity,Thy fairness is not like to Agripyne’s,For dead, her beauty will no beauty have,But thy face looks most lovely in the grave._Enter the_ PRINCE OF CYPRUS _and_ AGRIPYNE._Gall._ See where they come together, hand in hand._Orle._ O watch, sweet Galloway, when their hands do part,Between them shalt thou find my murdered heart._Cypr._ By this then it seems a thing impossible, to know whenan English lady loves truly._Agrip._ Not so, for when her soul steals into her heart, andher heart leaps up to her eyes, and her eyes drop into herhands, then if she say, Here’s my hand! she’s your own,--elsenever._Cyp._ Here’s a pair of your prisoners, let’s try their opinion._Agrip._ My kind prisoners, well encountered; the Prince ofCyprus here and myself have been wrangling about a questionof love: my lord of Orleans, you look lean, and likest alover--Whether is it more torment to love a lady and never enjoyher, or always to enjoy a lady whom you cannot choose but hate?_Orle._ To hold her ever in mine arms whom I loath in my heart,were some plague, yet the punishment were no more than to beenjoined to keep poison in my hand, yet never to taste it._Agrip._ But say you should be compelled to swallow the poison?_Orle._ Then a speedy death would end a speeding misery. But tolove a lady and never enjoy her, oh it is not death, but worsethan damnation; ’tis hell, ’tis----_Agrip._ No more, no more, good Orleans; nay then, I see myprisoner is in love too._Cypr._ Methinks, soldiers cannot fall into the fashion of love._Agrip._ Methinks a soldier is the most faithful lover of allmen else; for his affection stands not upon compliment. Hiswooing is plain home-spun stuff; there’s no outlandish thread init, no rhetoric. A soldier casts no figures to get his mistress’heart; his love is like his valour in the field, when he paysdownright blows._Gall._ True, madam, but would you receive such payment?_Agrip._ No, but I mean, I love a soldier best for his plaindealing._Cypr._ That’s as good as the first._Agrip._ Be it so, that goodness I like: for what lady can abideto love a spruce silken-face courtier, that stands every morningtwo or three hours learning how to look by his glass, how tospeak by his glass, how to sigh by his glass, how to court hismistress by his glass? I would wish him no other plague, but tohave a mistress as brittle as glass._Gall._ And that were as bad as the horn plague._Cypr._ Are any lovers possessed with this madness?_Agrip._ What madmen are not possessed with this love? Yet by mytroth, we poor women do but smile in our sleeves to see all thisfoppery: yet we all desire to see our lovers attired gallantly,to hear them sing sweetly, to behold them dance comely and suchlike. But this apish monkey fashion of effeminate niceness, outupon it! Oh, I hate it worse than to be counted a scold._Cypr._ Indeed, men are most regarded, when they least regardthemselves._Gall._ And women most honoured, when they show most mercy totheir lovers._Orle._ But is’t not a miserable tyranny, to see a lady triumphin the passions of a soul languishing through her cruelty?_Cypr._ Methinks it is._Gall._ Methinks ’tis more than tyranny._Agrip._ So think not I; for as there is no reason to hate anythat love us, so it were madness to love all that do not hateus; women are created beautiful, only because men should woothem; for ’twere miserable tyranny to enjoin poor women towoo men: I would not hear of a woman in love, for my father’skingdom._Cypr._ I never heard of any woman that hated love._Agrip._ Nor I: but we had all rather die than confess we love;our glory is to hear men sigh whilst we smile, to kill them witha frown, to strike them dead with a sharp eye, to make you thisday wear a feather, and to-morrow a sick nightcap. Oh, why thisis rare, there’s a certain deity in this, when a lady by themagic of her looks, can turn a man into twenty shapes._Orle._ Sweet friend, she speaks this but to torture me._Gall._ I’ll teach thee how to plague her: love her not._Agrip._ Poor Orleans, how lamentably he looks: if he stay,he’ll make me surely love him for pure pity. I must send himhence, for of all sorts of love, I hate the French; I pray thee,sweet prisoner, entreat Lord Longaville to come to me presently._Orle._ I will, and esteem myself more than happy, that you willemploy me. [_Exit.__Agrip._ Watch him, watch him for God’s sake, if he sigh not orlook not back._Cypr._ He does both: but what mystery lies in this?_Agrip._ Nay, no mystery, ’tis as plain as Cupid’s forehead: whythis is as it should be.--“And esteem myself more than happy,that you will employ me.” My French prisoner is in love overhead and ears._Cypr._ It’s wonder how he ’scapes drowning._Gall._ With whom, think you?_Agrip._ With his keeper, for a good wager: Ah, how glad ishe to obey! And how proud am I to command in this empire ofaffection! Over him and such spongy-livered youths, that liesoaking in love, I triumph more with mine eye, than ever he didover a soldier with his sword. Is’t not a gallant victory for meto subdue my father’s enemy with a look? Prince of Cyprus, youwere best take heed, how you encounter an English lady._Cypr._ God bless me from loving any of you, if all be so cruel._Agrip._ God bless me from suffering you to love me, if you benot so formable._Cypr._ Will you command me any service, as you have doneOrleans?_Agrip._ No other service but this, that, as Orleans, you loveme, for no other reason, but that I may torment you._Cypr._ I will: conditionally, that in all company I may callyou my tormentor._Agrip._ You shall: conditionally, that you never beg for mercy.Come, my Lord of Galloway._Gall._ Come, sweet madam.[_Exeunt all except the_ PRINCE OF CYPRUS._Cypr._ The ruby-coloured portals of her speechWere closed by mercy: but upon her eye,Attired in frowns, sat murdering cruelty._Re-enter_ AGRIPYNE _and listens_.She’s angry, that I durst so high aspire.O, she disdains that any stranger’s breastShould be a temple for her deity:She’s full of beauty, full of bitterness.Till now, I did not dally with love’s fire:And when I thought to try his flames indeed,I burnt me even to cinders. O, my stars,Why from my native shore did your beams guide me,To make me dote on her that doth deride me?[AGRIPYNE _kneels_: CYPRUS _walks musing_._Agrip._ Hold him in this mind, sweet Cupid, I conjure thee. O,what music these hey-hos make! I was about to cast my littleself into a great love trance for him, fearing his heart hadbeen flint: but since I see ’tis pure virgin wax, he shall melthis bellyful: for now I know how to temper him. [_Exit; as shedeparts_ CYPRUS _spies her_._Cypr._ Never beg mercy? yet be my tormentor.I hope she heard me not: doubtless she did,And now will she insult upon my passions,And vex my constant love with mockeries.Nay, then I’ll be mine own physician,And outface love, and make her think that IMourned thus, because I saw her standing by.What news, my Lord of Cornwall?_Enter_ CORNWALL._Cornw._ This fair prince,One of your countrymen, is come to court,A lusty gallant brave, in Cyprus’ isle,With fifty bard[386] horses prancing at his heels,Backed by as many strong-limbed Cypriots,All whom he keeps in pay: whose offered service,Our king with arms of gladness hath embraced.[386] Barded, or barbed: _i.e._ Adorned with trappings._Cypr._ Born in the isle of Cyprus? what’s his name?_Cornw._ His servants call him Fortunatus’ son._Cypr._ Rich Fortunatus’ son? Is he arrived?_Enter_ LONGAVILLE, GALLOWAY, _and_CHESTER _with jewels_._Longa._ This he bestowed on me._Chest._ And this on me._Gall._ And this his bounteous hand enforced me take._Longa._ I prize this jewel at a hundred marks,[387]Yet would he needs bestow this gift on me.[387] The mark was worth 13_s._ 4_d.__Cypr._ My lords, whose hand hath been thus prodigal?_Gall._ Your countryman, my lord, a Cypriot._Longa._ The gallant sure is all compact of gold,To every lady hath he given rich jewels,And sent to every servant in the courtTwenty fair English angels.[388][388] The angel varied from 6_s._ 8_d._ to 10_s._ in value._Cypr._ This is rare._Enter_ LINCOLN._Linc._ My lords, prepare yourselves for revelling,’Tis the king’s pleasure that this day be spentIn royal pastimes, that this golden lord,For so all that behold him, christen him,May taste the pleasures of our English court.Here comes the gallant, shining like the sun.      [_Trumpets sound._ _Enter_ ATHELSTANE, ANDELOCIA,AGRIPYNE, ORLEANS, _~Ladies~, and other~Attendants~, also_ INSULTADO. _Music sounds within.__Andel._ For these your royal favours done to me,Being a poor stranger, my best powers shall prove,By acts of worth, the soundness of my love._Athelst._ Herein your love shall best set out itself,By staying with us: if our English isleHold any object welcome to your eyes,Do but make choice, and claim it as your prize.      [_The_                             KING _and_ CYPRUS _confer aside_._Andel._ I thank your grace: would he durst keep his word,I know what I would claim. Tush, man, be bold,Were she a saint, she may be won with gold._Cypr._ ’Tis strange, I must confess, but in this pride,His father Fortunatus, if he live,Consumes his life in Cyprus: still he spends,And still his coffers with abundance swell,But how he gets these riches none can tell.

Cowardliness or pride?_Andel._ Neither: but ’tis the fashion of us Cypriots, bothmen and women, to yield at first assault, and we expect othersshould do the like._Agrip._ It’s a sign, that either your women are very black, andare glad to be sped, or your men very fond, and will take nodenial._Andel._ Indeed our ladies are not so fair as you._Agrip._ But your men more venturous at a breach than you, orelse they are all dastardly soldiers._Andel._ He that fights under these sweet colours, and yet turnscoward, let him be shot to death with the terrible arrows offair ladies’ eyes._Athelst._ Nay, Insultado, you must not deny us._Insultad._ _Mi corazon es muy pesado, mi anima muy atormentada.No por los Cielos: El pie de Español no hace musica en tierraingles._[390][390] “My heart is weighed down, my soul much tormented. No,by Heaven, the Spanish foot does not beat to music on Englishground.”_Cypr._ Sweet Insultado, let us see you dance.I have heard the Spanish dance is full of state._Insultad._ _Verdad, señor: la danza española es muy alta,Majestica, y para monarcas: vuestra Inglesa,Baja, fantastica, y muy humilde._[391][391] “The truth, sir; the Spanish dance is full of state,majestic, and fit for monarchs: your English low, fantastic, andvery humble.”_Agrip._ Doth my Spanish prisoner deny to dance? He has swornto me by the cross of his pure Toledo, to be my servant: by thatoath, my Castilian prisoner, I conjure you to show your cunning;though all your body be not free, I am sure your heels are atliberty._Insultad._ _Nolo quiero contra deseo; vuestro ojo haceconquista á su prisionero: Oyerer la a pavan española; seavuestra musica y gravidad, y majestad: Paje, daime tabacco, tomamy capa, y my espada. Mas alta, mas alta: Desviaios, desviaios,compañeros, mas alta, mas alta._[392] [_He dances._[392] “I desire only to please you: your eye has conquered itsprisoner. You shall hear the Spanish Pavan, let your music begrave and majestic: Page, give me tobacco; take my cloak andmy sword. Higher, higher: Make way, make way friends, higher,higher.” The Pavan was a stately Spanish dance._Athelst._ Thanks, Insultado._Cypr._ ’Tis most excellent._Agrip._ The Spaniard’s dance is as his deeds be, full of pride._Athelst._ The day grows old, and what remains unspent,Shall be consumed in banquets. Agripyne,Leave us a while, if Andelocia please,Go bear our beauteous daughter company._And._ Fortune, I thank thee: now thou smil’st on me.

With his own handsHe threw more wealth about in every street,Than could be thrust into a chariot.He’s a magician sure, and to some fiend,His soul by infernal covenants has he sold,Always to swim up to the chin in gold.Be what he can be, if those doting fires,Wherein he burns for Agripyne’s love,Want power to melt from him this endless mine,Then like a slave we’ll chain him in our tower,Where tortures shall compel his sweating handsTo cast rich heaps into our treasury.

Enter_ATHELSTANE._Agrip._ I have found the sacred spring that never ebbs.Leave us: [_Exit ~Lady~._] But I’ll not show’t your majestyTill you have sworn by England’s royal crown,To let me keep it._Athelst._ By my crown I swear,None but fair Agripyne the gem shall wear._Agrip._ Then is this mine: see, father, here’s the fireWhose gilded beams still burn, this is the sunThat ever shines, the tree that never dies,Here grows the Garden of Hesperides;The outside mocks you, makes you think ’tis poor,But entering it, you find eternal store._Athelst._ Art sure of this? How didst thou drive it out?_Agrip._ Fear not his waking yet, I made him drinkThat soporiferous juice which was composedTo make the queen,[393] my mother, relish sleep,When her last sickness summoned her to Heaven.He sleeps profoundly: when his amorous eyesHad singed their wings in Cupid’s wanton flames,I set him all on fire, and promised love,In pride whereof, he drew me forth this purse,And swore, by this he multiplied his gold.I tried and found it true: and secretlyCommanded music with her silver tongue,To chime soft lullabies into his soul,And whilst my fingers wantoned with his hair,T’entice the sleepy juice to charm his eyes,In all points was there made a purse, like his,Which counterfeit is hung in place of this.[393] History does not record that Athelstane had either wife ordaughter._Athelst._ More than a second kingdom hast thou won.Leave him, that when he wakes he may suspect,Some else has robbed him; come, dear Agripyne,If this strange purse his sacred virtues hold,We’ll circle England with a wall of gold.

Music? O delicate warble: Othese courtiers are most sweet triumphant creatures! Seignior,sir, monsieur, sweet seignior: this is the language of theaccomplishment. O delicious strings; these heavenly wire-drawershave stretched my master even out at length: yet at length hemust wake. Master?_Andel._ Wake me not yet, my gentle Agripyne._Shad._ One word, sir, for the billets, and I vanish._Andel._ There’s Heaven in these times: throw the musiciansA bounteous largesse of three hundred angels.   [ANDELOCIA _starts up_._Shad._ Why, sir, I have but ten pounds left._Andel._ Ha, Shadow? where’s the Princess Agripyne?_Shad._ I am not Apollo, I cannot reveal._Andel._ Was not the princess here, when thou cam’st in?_Shad._ Here was no princess but my princely self._Andel._ In faith?_Shad._ No, in faith, sir._Andel._ Where are you hid? where stand you wantoning? Not here?gone, i’faith? have you given me the slip? Well, ’tis but anamorous trick, and so I embrace it: my horse, Shadow, how faresmy horse?_Shad._ Upon the best oats my under-steward can buy._Andel._ I mean, are they lusty, sprightly, gallant, wanton,fiery?_Shad._ They are as all horses are, caterpillars to thecommonwealth, they are ever munching: but, sir, for thesebillets, and these fagots and bavins?_Andel._ ’Sheart, what billets, what fagots? dost make me awoodmonger?_Shad._ No, sweet seignior, but you have bid the king and hispeers to dinner, and he has commanded that no woodmonger sellyou a stick of wood, and that no collier shall cozn you of yourmeasure, but must tie up the mouth of their sacks, lest theircoals kindle your choler._Andel._ Is’t possible? is’t true, or hast thou learnt of theEnglish gallants to gull?_Shad._ He’s a gull that would be taught by such gulls._Andel._ Not a stick of wood? Some child of envy has buzzed thisstratagem into the king’s ear, of purpose to disgrace me. I haveinvited his majesty, and though it cost me a million, I’ll feasthim. Shadow, thou shalt hire a hundred or two of carts, withthem post to all the grocers in London, buy up all the cinnamon,cloves, nutmegs, liquorice and all other spices, that have anystrong heart, and with them make fires to prepare our cookery.Ere Fortunatus’ son look red with shame,He’ll dress a king’s feast in a spicèd flame._Shad._ This device, sir, will be somewhat akin to Lady Pride,’twill ask cost._Andel._ Fetch twenty porters, I’ll lade all with gold._Shad._ First, master, fill these bags._Andel._ Come then, hold up. How now? tricks, new crotchets,Madame Fortune? Dry as an eel-skin? Shadow, take thou my goldout._Shad._ Why, sir, here’s none in._Andel._ Ha, let me see: O here’s a bastard cheek,I see now ’tis not mine; ’tis counterfeit,’Tis so! Slave, thou hast robbed thy master._Shad._ Not of a penny, I have been as true a steward--_Andel._ Vengeance on thee and on thy stewardship!Yet wherefore curse I thee? thy leaden soulHad never power to mount up to the knowledgeOf the rich mystery closed in my purse.Oh no, I’ll curse myself, mine eyes I’ll curse,They have betrayed me; I will curse my tongue,That hath betrayed me; I’ll curse Agripyne,She hath betrayed me. Sirens, cease to sing,Your charms have ta’en effect, for now I see,All your enchantments were, to cozen me.      [_Music ceases.__Shad._ What shall I do with this ten pound, sir?_Andel._ Go buy with it a chain and hang thyself.Now think I on my father’s prophecy.Tell none, quoth he, the virtue, if you do,Much shame, much grief, much danger follows you.With tears I credit his divinity.O fingers, were you upright justices,You would tear out mine eyes! had not they gazedOn the frail colour of a painted cheek,None had betrayed me: henceforth I’ll defyAll beauty, and will call a lovely eye,A sun whose scorching beams burn up our joys,Or turn them black like Ethiopians.O women, wherefore are you born men’s woe,Why are your faces framed angelical?Your hearts of sponges, soft and smooth in show,But touched, with poison they do overflow.Had sacred wisdom been my father’s fate,He had died happy, I lived fortunate.Shadow, bear this to beauteous Agripyne,With it this message, tell her, I’ll reproveHer covetous sin the less, because for gold,I see that most men’s souls too cheap are sold._Shad._ Shall I buy these spices to-day or to-morrow?_Andel._ To-morrow? ay, to-morrow thou shalt buy them.To-morrow tell the princess I will love her,To-morrow tell the king I’ll banquet him,To-morrow, Shadow, will I give thee gold;To-morrow pride goes bare and lust acold.To-morrow will the rich man feed the poor,And vice to-morrow virtue will adore.To-morrow beggars shall be crownèd kings,This no-time, morrow’s-time, no sweetness sings:I pray thee hence; bear that to Agripyne._Shad._ I’ll go hence, because you send me; but I’ll go weepinghence, for grief that I must turn villain as many do, and leaveyou when you are up to the ears in adversity. [_Exit.__Andel._ She hath robbed me, and now I’ll play the thief,Ay, steal from hence to Cyprus, for black shameHere, through my riots, brands my lofty name.I’ll sell this pride for help to bear me thither,So pride and beggary shall walk together.This world is but a school of villany,Therefore I’ll rob my brother, not of gold,Nor of his virtues, virtue none will steal--But, if I can, I’ll steal his wishing hat,And with that, wandering round about the world,I’ll search all corners to find Misery,And where she dwells, I’ll dwell, languish and die.      [_Exit._ACT THE FOURTH.Chorus. Gentles, if e’er you have beheld the passions,The combats of his soul, who being a king,By some usurping hand hath been deposedFrom all his royalties: even such a soul,Such eyes, such heart swol’n big with sighs and tears,The star-crossed son of Fortunatus wears.His thoughts crowned him a monarch in the morn,Yet now he’s bandied by the seas in scornFrom wave to wave: his golden treasure’s spoilMakes him in desperate language to entreatThe winds to spend their fury on his life:But they, being mild in tyranny, or scorningTo triumph in a wretch’s funeral,Toss him to Cyprus. Oh, what treacheryCannot this serpent gold entice us to?He robs his brother of the Soldan’s prize,And having got his wish, the wishing hat,He does not, as he vowed, seek misery,But hopes by that to win his purse again,And in that hope from Cyprus is he fled.If your swift thoughts clap on their wonted wings,In Genoa may you take this fugitive,Where having cozened many jewellers,To England back he comes; step but to court,And there disguised you find him bargainingFor jewels with the beauteous Agripyne,Who wearing at her side the virtuous purse,He clasps her in his arms, and as a raven,Griping the tender-hearted nightingale,So flies he with her, wishing in the airTo be transported to some wilderness:Imagine this the place; see, here they come!Since they themselves have tongues, mine shall be dumb.      [_Exit._SCENE I.--_A Wilderness.__Enter_ ANDELOCIA _with the wishing hat on, and dragging_ AGRIPYNE_by the hand_.Agrip. What devil art thou that affright’st me thus,Haling a princess from her father’s court,To spoil her in this savage wilderness?_Andel._ Indeed the devil and the pick-purse should always flytogether, for they are sworn brothers: but Madam Covetousness,I am neither a devil as you call me, nor a jeweller as I callmyself; no, nor a juggler,--yet ere you and I part, we’ll havesome legerdemain together. Do you know me?_Agrip._ I am betrayed: this is the Cypriot.Forgive me, ’twas not I that changed thy purse,But Athelstane my father; send me home,And here’s thy purse again: here are thy jewels,And I in satisfaction of all wrongs--_Andel._ Talk not you of satisfaction, this is some recompense,that I have you. ’Tis not the purse I regard: put it off, andI’ll mince it as small as pie meat. The purse? hang the purse:were that gone, I can make another, and another, and another,ay, and another: ’tis not the purse I care for, but the purser,you, ay you. Is’t not a shame that a king’s daughter, a fairlady, a lady not for lords, but for monarchs, should for goldsell her love, and when she has her own asking, and that therestands nothing between, then to cheat your sweetheart? O fie,fie, a she cony-catcher? You must be dealt fondly with._Agrip._ Enjoin what pains thou wilt, and I’ll endure them,So thou wilt send me to my father’s court._Andel._ Nay God’s lid, y’are not gone so: set your heart atrest, for I have set up my rest, that except you can run swifterthan a hart, home you go not. What pains shall I lay upon you?Let me see: I could serve you now but a slippery touch: I couldget a young king or two, or three, of you, and then send youhome, and bid their grandsire king nurse them: I could pepperyou, but I will not._Agrip._ O, do not violate my chastity._Andel._ No, why I tell you I am not given to the flesh, thoughI savour in your nose a little of the devil, I could run awayelse, and starve you here._Agrip._ If I must die, doom me some easier death._Andel._ Or transform you, because you love picking, into asquirrel, and make you pick out a poor living here among the nuttrees: but I will not neither._Agrip._ What will my gentle Andelocia do?_Andel._ Oh, now you come to your old bias of cogging.[394][394] Your old mind (or, more literally, inclination) ofcajoling._Agrip._ I pray thee, Andelocia, let me go:Send me to England, and by Heaven I swear,Thou from all kings on earth my love shalt bear._Andel._ Shall I in faith?_Agrip._ In faith, in faith thou shalt._Andel._ Hear, God a mercy: now thou shalt not go._Agrip._ Oh God._Andel._ Nay, do you hear, lady? Cry not, y’are best; no norcurse me not. If you think but a crabbed thought of me, thespirit that carried you in mine arms through the air, will tellme all; therefore set your Sunday face upon’t. Since you’ll loveme, I’ll love you, I’ll marry you, and lie with you, and begetlittle jugglers: marry, home you get not. England, you’ll say,is yours: but, Agripyne, love me, and I will make the wholeworld thine._Agrip._ I care not for the world, thou murd’rest me;Between my sorrow, and the scalding sunI faint, and quickly will my life be done,My mouth is like a furnace, and dry heatDrinks up my blood. O God, my heart will burst,I die, unless some moisture quench my thirst._Andel._ ’Sheart, now I am worse than ere I was before:For half the world I would not have her die.Here’s neither spring nor ditch, nor rain, nor dew,Nor bread nor drink: my lovely Agripyne,Be comforted, see here are apple trees._Agrip._ Climb up for God’s sake, reach me some of them._Andel._ Look up, which of these apples likes thee best?_Agrip._ This hath a withered face, ’tis some sweet fruit.Not that, my sorrows are too sour already._Andel._ Come hither, here are apples like gold._Agrip._ O, ay, for God’s sake, gather some of these.Ay me, would God I were at home again!_Andel._ Stand farther, lest I chance to fall on thee.   [_Climbs up._Oh here be rare apples, rare red-cheeked apples, that cry comekiss me: apples, hold your peace, I’ll teach you to cry. [_Eatsone.__Agrip._ O England, shall I ne’er behold thee more?_Andel._ Agripyne, ’tis a most sugared delicious taste in one’smouth, but when ’tis down, ’tis as bitter as gall._Agrip._ Yet gather some of them. Oh, that a princessShould pine for food: were I at home again,I should disdain to stand thus and complain._Andel._ Here’s one apple that grows highest, Agripyne; an’ Icould reach that, I’ll come down. [_Fishes with his girdle forit.__Agrip._ Make haste, for the hot sun doth scald my cheeks._Andel._ The sun kiss thee? hold, catch, put on my hat, I willhave yonder highest apple, though I die for’t._Agrip._ I had not wont be sun-burnt, wretched me.O England, would I were again in thee!      [_Exit._ANDELOCIA _leaps down_._Andel._ ’Swounds, Agripyne, stay, Oh I am undone!Sweet Agripyne, if thou hear’st my voice,Take pity of me, and return again.She flies like lightning: Oh she hears me not!I wish myself into a wilderness,And now I shall turn wild: here I shall famish,Here die, here cursing die, here raving die,And thus will wound my breast, and rend mine hair.What hills of flint are grown upon my brows?O me, two forkèd horns, I am turned beast,I have abused two blessings, wealth and knowledge,Wealth in my purse, and knowledge in my hat,By which being borne into the courts of kings,I might have seen the wondrous works of Jove,Acquired experience, learning, wisdom, truth,But I in wildness tottered out my youth,And therefore must turn wild, must be a beast,An ugly beast: my body horns must bear,Because my soul deformity doth wear.Lives none within this wood?

Inan earlier English edition of the story, published about 1650,however, they are otherwise described. It says there:--“Theywere brought from Jerusalem, and were from the Holy Garden.”_Agrip._ Damasco apples? good my Lord Montrose,Call yonder fellows._Montr._ Sirrah coster-monger._Shad._ Who calls: peeps of Tamasco, feene peeps: Ay, fat’tis de sweetest apple in de world, ’tis better den de Pomewater,[397] or apple John.[398][397] A large sweet apple, full of juice [see _Bailey’sDictionary_].[398] John apple, a good keeping apple, which long retains itsfreshness._Andel._ By my trat, madam, ’tis reet Tamasco peepins, lookhere els._Shad._ I dare not say, as de Irishman my countryman say, tastede goodness of de fruit: no, sayt, ’tis farie teere, mistriss,by Saint Patrick’s hand ’tis teere Tamasco apple._Agrip._ The fairest fruit that ever I beheld.Damasco apples, wherefore are they good?_Longa._ What is your price of half a score of these?_Both._ Half a score, half a score? dat is doos many,mester.[399][399] “That is too many, master.” Dekker’s Irish even surpasseshis Dutch in unintelligibility, and it would need more spacethan mere footnotes can afford, to attempt any full elucidation._Longa._ Ay, ay, ten, half a score, that’s five and five._Andel._ Feeve and feeve? By my trat and as Creeze save me la,I cannot tell wat be de price of feeve and feeve, but ’tis treecrown for one peepin, dat is de preez if you take ’em._Shad._ Ay fat, ’tis no less for Tamasco._Agrip._ Three crowns for one? what wondrous virtues have they?_Shad._ O, ’tis feene Tamasco apple, and shall make you a greatteal wise, and make you no fool, and make feene memory._Andel._ And make dis fash be more fair and amiable, and makedis eyes look always lovely, and make all de court and countryburn in desire to kiss di none sweet countenance._Montr._ Apples to make a lady beautiful?Madam, that’s excellent._Agrip._ These Irishmen,Some say, are great dissemblers, and I fearThese two the badge of their own country wear._Andel._ By my trat, and by Saint Patrick’s hand, and as Creezsave me la, ’tis no dissembler: de Irishman now and den cut dicountryman’s throat, but yet in fayt he love di countryman,’tis no dissembler: dis feene Tamasco apple can make di sweetcountenance, but I can take no less but three crowns for one, Iwear out my naked legs and my foots, and my tods,[400] and runhidder and didder to Tamasco for dem.[400] Stockings probably, from the use of the term for bales ofwool._Shad._ As Creez save me la, he speaks true: Peeps feene._Agrip._ I’ll try what power lies in Damasco fruit.Here are ten crowns for three. So fare you well._Montr._ Lord Longaville, buy some._Longa._ I buy? not I:Hang them, they are toys; come, madam, let us go.      [_Exeunt_                             AGRIPYNE, LONGAVILLE _and_ MONTROSE._Both._ Saint Patrick and Saint Peter, and all de holy angelslook upon dat fash and make it fair._Re-enter_ MONTROSE _softly_._Shad._ Ha, ha, ha! she’s sped, I warrant._Andel._ Peace, Shadow, buy any peepins, buy._Both._ Peeps feene, feene Tamasco apples._Montr._ Came not Lord Longaville to buy some fruit?_Andel._ No fat, master, here came no lords nor ladies, but dinone sweet self._Montr._ ’Tis well, say nothing, here’s six crowns for two:You say the virtues are to make one strong._Both._ Yes fat, and make sweet countenance and strong too._Montr._ ’Tis excellent: here! farewell! if these prove,I’ll conquer men by strength, women by love.      [_Exit.__Re-enter_ LONGAVILLE._Andel._ Ha, ha, ha! why this is rare._Shad._ Peace, master, here comes another fool._Both._ Peepes feene, buy any peepes of Tamasco?_Longa._ Did not the Lord Montrose return to you?_Both._ No fat, sweet master, no lord did turn to us: peepesfeene!_Longa._ I am glad of it; here are nine crowns for three.What are the virtues besides making fair?_Andel._ O, ’twill make thee wondrous wise._Shad._ And dow shall be no more a fool, but sweet face and wise._Longa._ ’Tis rare, farewell, I never yet durst woo.None loves me: now I’ll try what these can do.      [_Exit.__Andel._ Ha, ha, ha. So, this is admirable, Shadow, here end mytorments in Saint Patrick’s Purgatory, but thine shall continuelonger._Shad._ Did I not clap on a good false Irish face?_Andel._ It became thee rarely._Shad._ Yet that’s lamentable, that a false face should becomeany man._Andel._ Thou art a gull,[401] tis all the fashion now, whichfashion because we’ll keep, step thou abroad, let not the worldwant fools; whilst thou art commencing thy knavery there, I’llprecede Dr. Dodipoll[402] here: that done, thou, Shadow, and Iwill fat ourselves[403] to behold the transformation of thesefools: go fly.[401] Dekker uses “Gallant,” as an equivalent in _The Gull’sHorn-Book_, but he means something more opprobrious;--“Masher,”as we would say to-day, a fool of fashion.[402] An allusion to the comedy _The Wisdom of Dr. Dodipoll_.[403] _i.e._ Grow jolly, at the spectacle._Shad._ I fear nothing, but that whilst we strive to make othersfools, we shall wear the cock’s combs ourselves. Pips fine.[_Exit_ SHADOW._Enter_ AMPEDO._Andel._ S’heart, here’s my brother whom I have abused:His presence makes me blush, it strikes me dead,To think how I am metamorphosèd.Feene peepins of Tamasco!_Amp._ For shame cast off this mask._Andel._ Wilt thou buy any pips?_Amp._ Mock me no longerWith idle apparitions: many a landHave I with weary feet and a sick soulMeasured to find thee; and when thou art found,My greatest grief is that thou art not lost.Yet lost thou art, thy fame, thy wealth are lost,Thy wits are lost, and thou hast in their stead,With shame and cares, and misery crowned thy head.That Shadow that pursues thee, filled mine earsWith sad relation of thy wretchedness,Where is the purse, and where my wishing hat?_Andel._ Where, and where? are you created constable? You standso much upon interrogatories. The purse is gone, let that fretyou, and the hat is gone, let that mad you: I run thus throughall trades to overtake them, if you be quiet, follow me, andhelp, if not, fly from me, and hang yourself. Wilt thou buy anypippins? [_Exit.__Amp._ Oh, how I grieve, to see him thus transformed?Yet from the circles of my jealous eyesHe shall not start, till he have repossessedThose virtuous jewels, which found once again,More cause they ne’er shall give me to complain,Their worth shall be consumed in murdering flames,And end my grief, his riot, and our shames.

In spite of sorcery try once again,Try once more in contempt of all damned spells._Agrip._ Your majesty fights with no mortal power.Shame, and not conquest, hangs upon this strife.O, touch me not, you add but pain to pain,The more you cut, the more they grow again._Linc._ Is there no art to conjure down this scorn?I ne’er knew physic yet against the horn._Enter_ CYPRUS._Athelst._ See, Prince of Cyprus, thy fair AgripyneHath turned her beauty to deformity._Cypr._ Then I defy thee, Love; vain hopes, adieu,You have mocked me long; in scorn I’ll now mock you.I came to see how the Lord LongavilleWas turned into a monster, and I findAn object, which both strikes me dumb and blind.To-morrow should have been our marriage morn,But now my bride is shame, thy bridegroom scorn.tell me yet, is there no art, no charms,No desperate physic for this desperate wound?_Athelst._ All means are tried, but no means can be found._Cypr._ Then, England, farewell: hapless maid, thy stars,Through spiteful influence set our hearts at wars.I am enforced to leave thee, and resignMy love to grief._Enter_ ORLEANS _and_ GALLOWAY._Agrip._ All grief to Agripyne._Cypr._ Adieu, I would say more, had I a tongueAble to help his master: mighty king,I humbly take my leave; to Cyprus I;My father’s son must all such shame defy.      [_Exit.__Orle._ So doth not Orleans; I defy all thoseThat love not Agripyne, and him defy,That dares but love her half so well as I.O pardon me! I have in sorrow’s jailBeen long tormented, long this mangled bosomHath bled, and never durst expose her wounds,Till now, till now, when at thy beauteous feetI offer love and life. Oh, cast an eyeOf mercy on me, this deformèd faceCannot affright my soul from loving thee._Agrip._ Talk not of love, good Orleans, but of hate._Orle._ What sentence will my love pronounce on me?_Gall._ Will Orleans then be mad? O gentle friend._Orle._ O gentle, gentle friend, I am not mad:He’s mad, whose eyes on painted cheeks do doat,O Galloway, such read beauty’s book by rote.He’s mad, that pines for want of a gay flower,Which fades when grief doth blast, or sickness lower,Which heat doth wither, and white age’s frostNips dead: such fairness, when ’tis found, ’tis lost.I am not mad, for loving Agripyne,My love looks on her eyes with eyes divine;I doat on the rich brightness of her mind,That sacred beauty strikes all other blind.O make me happy then, since my desiresAre set a burning by love’s purest fires._Athelst._ So thou wilt bear her far from England’s sight,Enjoy thy wishes._Agrip._ Lock me in some cave,Where staring wonder’s eye shall not be guiltyTo my abhorrèd looks, and I will dieTo thee, as full of love as misery._Athelst._ I am amazed and mad, some speckled soulLies pawned for this in hell, without redemption,Some fiend deludes us all._Cornw._ O unjust Fates,Why do you hide from us this mystery?_Linc._ My Lord Montrose, how long have your brows wornThis fashion? these two feather springs of horn?_Montr._ An Irish kerne sold me Damasco applesSome two hours since, and like a credulous fool--He swearing to me that they had this powerTo make me strong in body, rich in mind--I did believe his words, tasted his fruit,And since have been attired in this disguise._Longa._ I fear that villain hath beguiled me too._Cornw._ Nay before God he has not cozened you,You have it soundly._Longa._ Me he made believe,One apple of Damasco would inspireMy thoughts with wisdom, and upon my cheeksWould cast such beauty that each lady’s eye,Which looked on me, should love me presently._Agrip._ Desire to look more fair, makes me more fool,[404]Those apples did entice my wandering eye,To be enamoured of deformity.[404] A play upon “fool” and “foul.”_Athelst._ This proves that true, which oft I have heard in schools,Those that would seem most wise, do turn most fools._Linc._ Here’s your best hope, none needs to hide his face,For hornèd foreheads swarm in every place._Enter_ CHESTER, _with_ ANDELOCIA _disguisedas a ~French Soldier~.__Athelst._ Now, Chester, what physicians hast thou found?_Chest._ Many, my liege, but none that have true skillTo tame such wild diseases: yet here’s one,A doctor and a Frenchman, whom reportOf Agripyne’s grief hath drawn to court._Athelst._ Cure her, and England’s treasury shall stand,As free for thee to use, as rain from Heaven._Montr._ Cure me, and to thy coffers I will sendMore gold from Scotland than thy life can spend._Longa._ Cure Longaville, and all his wealth is thine._Andel._ He Monsieur Long-villain,[405] gra tanck you: Gra tanckyour mashesty a great teal artely by my trat: where be dis MadamPrinceza dat be so mush tormenta?

Sighnot for your purse, money may be got by you, as well as bythe little Welshwoman in Cyprus, that had but one horn in herhead;[407] you have two, and perhaps you shall cast both. Asyou use me, mark those words well, “as you use me,” nay, y’arebest fly, I’ll not endure one word more. Yet stay too, becauseyou entreat me so gently, and that I’ll make some amends to yourfather,--although I care not for any king in Christendom, yethold you, take this apple, eat it as you go to court, and yourhorns shall play the cowards and fall from you.[407] A reference probably to a woman exhibited at some showin London, and transferred by Dekker, with his usual artisticliberty, to Cyprus._Agrip._ O gentle Andelocia._Andel._ Nay, away, not a word._Shad._ Ha, ha, ha! ’Ware horns! [_Exit_ AGRIPYNE,_weeping_._Andel._ Why dost thou laugh, Shadow?_Shad._ To see what a horn plague follows covetousness and pride._Amp._ Brother, what mysteries lie in all this?_Andel._ Tricks, Ampedo, tricks, devices, and mad hieroglyphics,mirth, mirth, and melody. O, there’s more music in this, thanall the gamut airs, and sol fa res, in the world; here’s thepurse, and here’s the hat: because you shall be sure I’ll notstart, wear you this, you know its virtue. If danger beset you,fly and away: a sort of broken-shinned limping-legged jades runhobbling to seek us. Shadow, we’ll for all this have one fit ofmirth more, to make us laugh and be fat._Shad._ And when we are fat, master, we’ll do as all gluttonsdo, laugh and lie down._Andel._ Hie thee to my chamber, make ready my richest attire,I’ll to court presently._Shad._ I’ll go to court in this attire, for apparel is but theshadow of a man, but shadow is the substance of his apparel.[_Exit_ SHADOW._Andel._ Away, away, and meet me presently._Amp._ I had more need to cry away to thee.Away, away with this wild lunacy,Away with riots._Andel._ Away with your purity, brother, y’are an ass. Why doththis purse spit out gold but to be spent? why lives a man inthis world, to dwell in the suburbs of it, as you do? Away,foreign simplicity, away: are not eyes made to see fair ladies?hearts to love them? tongues to court them, and hands to feelthem? Out, you stock, you stone, you log’s end: Are not legsmade to dance, and shall mine limp up and down the world afteryour cloth-stocking-heels? You have the hat, keep it. Anon I’llvisit your virtuous countenance again; adieu! Pleasure is mysweet mistress, I wear her love in my hat, and her soul in myheart: I have sworn to be merry, and in spite of Fortune and theblack-browed Destinies, I’ll never be sad. [_Exit.__Amp._ Go, fool; in spite of mirth, thou shalt be sad.I’ll bury half thy pleasures in a graveOf hungry flames; this fire I did ordainTo burn both purse and hat: as this doth perish,So shall the other; count what good and badThey both have wrought, the good is to the illAs a small pebble to a mighty hill.Thy glory and thy mischiefs here shall burn;Good gifts abused to man’s confusion turn._Enter_ LONGAVILLE _and_ MONTROSE _with~Soldiers~_._Longa._ This is his brother: soldiers, bind his arms._Montr._ Bind arms and legs, and hale the fiend away._Amp._ Uncivil: wherefore must I taste your spite?_Longa._ Art thou not one of Fortunatus’ sons?_Amp._ I am, but he did never do you wrong._Longa._ The devil thy brother has; villain, look here._Montr._ Where is the beauteous purse and wishing hat?_Amp._ My brother Andelocia has the purse,This way he’ll come anon to pass to court.Alas, that sin should make men’s hearts so bold,To kill their souls for the base thirst of gold.The wishing hat is burnt._Montr._ Burnt? Soldiers, bind him.Tortures shall wring both hat and purse from you.Villain, I’ll be revenged for that base scornThy hell-hound brother clapped upon my head._Longa._ And so will Longaville.Away with him!_Montr._ Drag him to yonder tower, there shackle him,And in a pair of stocks lock up his heels,And bid your wishing cap deliver you.Give us the purse and hat, we’ll set thee free,Else rot to death and starve._Amp._ Oh tyranny, you need not scorn the badge which you did bear:Beasts would you be, though horns you did not wear._Montr._ Drag hence the cur: come, noble Longaville,One’s sure, and were the other fiend as fast,Their pride should cost their lives: their purse and hatShall both be ours, we’ll share them equally._Longa._ That will be some amends for arming me._Enter_ ANDELOCIA, _and_ SHADOW _after him_._Montr._ Peace, Longaville, yonder the gallant comes._Longa._ Y’are well encountered._Andel._ Thanks, Lord Longaville._Longa._ The king expects your presence at the court._Andel._ And thither am I going._Shad._ Pips fine, fine apples of Tamasco, ha, ha, ha!_Montr._ Wert thou that Irishman that cozened us?_Shad._ Pips fine, ha, ha, ha! no not I: not Shadow._Andel._ Were not your apples delicate and rare?_Longa._ The worst that e’er you sold; sirs, bind him fast._Andel._ What, will you murder me? help, help, some help!_Shad._ Help, help, help! [_Exit_ SHADOW._Montr._ Follow that dog, and stop his bawling throat._Andel._ Villains, what means this barbarous treachery?_Longa._ We mean to be revenged for our disgrace._Montr._ And stop the golden current of thy waste._Andel._ Murder! they murder me, O call for help._Longa._ Thy voice is spent in vain; come, come, this purse,This well-spring of your prodigality._Andel._ Are you appointed by the king to this?_Montr._ No, no; rise, spurn him up! know you who’s this?_Andel._ My brother Ampedo? Alas, what fateHath made thy virtues so unfortunate?_Amp._ Thy riot and the wrong of these two lords,Who causeless thus do starve[408] me in this prison.[408] This is an imaginative prevision on the part of Ampedo, asagain in his next speech, “My want is famine.”_Longa._ Strive not y’are best, villains, lift in his legs._Andel._ Traitors to honour, what do you intend?_Longa._ That riot shall in wretchedness have end.Question thy brother with what cost he’s fed,And so assure thou shall be banqueted.      [_Exeunt_ LONGAVILLE                                                  _and_ MONTROSE._Amp._ In want, in misery, in woe and care,Poor Ampedo his fill hath surfeited:My want is famine, bolts my misery,My care and woe should be thy portion._Andel._ Give me that portion, for I have a heartShall spend it freely, and make bankruptThe proudest woe that ever wet man’s eyes.Care, with a mischief! wherefore should I care?Have I rid side by side by mighty kings,Yet be thus bridled now? I’ll tear these fetters,Murder! cry, murder! Ampedo, aloud.To bear this scorn our fortunes are too proud._Amp._ O folly, thou hast power to make flesh glad,When the rich soul in wretchedness is clad._Andel._ Peace, fool, am I not Fortune’s minion?These bands are but one wrinkle of her frown,This is her evening mask, her next morn’s eyeShall overshine the sun in majesty._Amp._ But this sad night will make an end of me.Brother, farewell; grief, famine, sorrow, want,Have made an end of wretched Ampedo._Andel._ Where is the wishing hat?_Amp._ Consumed in fire._Andel._ Accursèd be those hands that did destroy it;That would redeem us, did we now enjoy it._Amp._ Wanton, farewell! I faint, Death’s frozen handCongeals life’s little river in my breast.No man before his end is truly blest.      [_Dies.__Andel._ O miserable, miserable soul!Thus a foul life makes death to look more foul._Re-enter_ LONGAVILLE _and_ MONTROSE _with ahalter_._Longa._ Thus shall this golden purse divided be,One day for you, another day for me._Montr._ Of days anon, say, what determine you,Shall they have liberty, or shall they die?_Longa._ Die sure: and see, I think the elder’s dead._Andel._ Ay, murderers, he is dead. O sacred Wisdom,Had Fortunatus been enamourèdOf thy celestial beauty, his two sonsHad shined like two bright suns._Longa._ Pull hard, Montrose._Andel._ Come you to strangle me? are you the hangman?Hell-hounds, y’are damned for this impiety.Fortune, forgive me! I deserve thy hate;Myself have made myself a reprobate.Virtue, forgive me! for I have transgressedAgainst thy laws; my vows are quite forgot,And therefore shame is fallen to my sin’s lot.Riches and knowledge are two gifts divine.They that abuse them both as I have done,To shame, to beggary, to hell must run.O conscience, hold thy sting, cease to afflict me.Be quick, tormentors, I desire to die;No death is equal to my misery.Cyprus, vain world and vanity, farewell.Who builds his Heaven on earth, is sure of hell.      [_Dies.__Longa._ He’s dead: in some deep vault let’s throw their bodies._Montr._ First let us see the purse, Lord Longaville._Longa._ Here ’tis, by this we’ll fill this tower with gold._Montr._ Frenchman, this purse is counterfeit._Longa._ Thou liest.Scot, thou hast cozened me, give me the right,Else shall thy bosom be my weapon’s grave._Montr._ Villain, thou shalt not rob me of my due.      [_They fight.__Enter_ ATHELSTANE, AGRIPYNE, ORLEANS, GALLOWAY, CORNWALL, CHESTER,LINCOLN, _and_ SHADOW _with weapons at one door_: FORTUNE, VICE, _andtheir ~Attendants~ at the other_._All._ Lay hands upon the murderers, strike them down._Fortune._ Surrender up this purse, for this is mine._All._ Are these two devils, or some powers divine?_Shad._ O see, see, O my two masters, poor Shadow’s substances;what shall I do? Whose body shall Shadow now follow?_Fortune._ Peace, idiot, thou shalt find rich heaps of fools,That will be proud to entertain a shadow.I charm thy babbling lips from troubling me.You need not hold them, see, I smite them downLower than hell: base souls, sink to your heaven._Vice._ I do arrest you both my prisoners._Fortune._ Stand not amazed, you gods of earth, at this,She that arresteth these two fools is Vice,They have broke Virtue’s laws, Vice is her sergeant,Her jailer and her executioner.Look on those Cypriots, Fortunatus’ sons,They and their father were my minions,My name is Fortune._All._ O dread deity!_Fortune._ Kneel not to me: if Fortune list to frown,You need not fall down, for she’ll spurn you down;Arise! but, fools, on you I’ll triumph thus:What have you gained by being covetous?This prodigal purse did Fortune’s bounteous handBestow on them, their riots made them poor,And set these marks of miserable deathOn all their pride, the famine of base goldHath made your souls to murder’s hands be sold,Only to be called rich. But, idiots, seeThe virtues to be fled, Fortune hath caused it so;Those that will all devour, must all forego._Athelst._ Most sacred Goddess!_Fortune._ Peace, you flatterer.Thy tongue but heaps more vengeance on thy head.Fortune is angry with thee, in thee burnsA greedy covetous fire, in AgripynePride like a monarch revels, and those sinsHave led you blind-fold to your former shames,But Virtue pardoned you, and so doth Fortune._Athelst._ and _Agrip._ All thanks to both your sacred deities._Fortune._ As for these metal-eaters, these base thieves,Who rather than they would be counted poor,Will dig through hell for gold,--you were forgivenBy Virtue’s general pardon; her broad sealGave you your lives, when she took off your horns.Yet having scarce one foot out of the jail,You tempt damnation by more desperate means,You both are mortal, and your pains shall ringThrough both your ears, to terrify your souls,As please the judgment of this mortal king._Athelst._ Fair Empress of the world, since you resignYour power to me, this sentence shall be mine:Thou shall be tortured on a wheel to death,Thou with wild horses shall be quarterèd.      [_Points to_ MONTROSE                                                    _and_ LONGAVILLE._Vice._ Ha, ha, weak judge, weak judgment; I reverseThat sentence, for they are my prisoners.Embalm the bodies of those Cypriots,And honour them with princely burial.For those do as you please; but for these two,I kiss you both, I love you, y’are my minions.Untie their bands, Vice doth reprieve you both.I set you free._Both._ Thanks, gracious deity._Vice._ Begone, but you in liberty shall findMore bondage than in chains; fools, get you hence,Both wander with tormented conscience._Longa._ O horrid judgment, that’s the hell indeed._Montr._ Come, come, our death ne’er ends if conscience bleed._Both._ O miserable, miserable men!      [_Exeunt_ LONGAVILLE                                               _and_ MONTROSE._Fortune._ Fortune triumphs at this, yet to appearAll like myself, that which from those I took,King Athelstane, I will bestow on thee,And in it the old virtue I infuse:But, king, take heed how thou my gifts dost use.England shall ne’er be poor, if England striveRather by virtue than by wealth to thrive._Enter_ VIRTUE, _crowned: ~Nymphs~ and ~Kings~ attending on her,crowned with olive branches and laurels; music sounding_._Vice._ Virtue? alas good soul, she hides her head._Virtue._ What envious tongue said, “Virtue hides her head?”_Vice._ She that will drive thee into banishment._Fortune._ She that hath conquered thee: how dar’st thou come,Thus tricked in gaudy feathers, and thus guardedWith crownèd kings and Muses, when thy foeHath trod thus on thee, and now triumphs so?Where’s virtuous Ampedo? See, he’s her slave;For following thee, this recompense they have._Virtue._ Is Ampedo her slave? Why, that’s my glory.The idiot’s cap I once wore on my head,Did figure him; those that like him do muffleVirtue in clouds, and care not how she shine,I’ll make their glory like to his decline.He made no use of me, but like a miser,Locked up his wealth in rusty bars of sloth;His face was beautiful, but wore a mask,And in the world’s eyes seemed a blackamoor:So perish they that so keep Virtue poor._Vice._ Thou art a fool to strive, I am more strong,And greater than thyself; then, Virtue, fly,And hide thy face, yield me the victory._Virtue._ Is Vice higher than Virtue? that’s my glory,The higher that thou art, thou art more horrid:The world will love me for my comeliness._Fortune._ Thine own self loves thyself: why on the headsOf Agripyne, Montrose, and Longaville,--English, Scot, French--did Vice clap ugly horns,But to approve that English, French and Scot,And all the world else, kneel and honour Vice;But in no country, Virtue is of price!_Virtue._ Yes, in all countries Virtue is of price,In every kingdom some diviner breastIs more enamoured of me than the rest.Have English, Scot and French bowed knees to thee?Why that’s my glory too, for by their shame,Men will abhor thee and adore my name.Fortune, thou art too weak, Vice, th’art a foolTo fight with me; I suffered you awhileT’eclipse my brightness, but I now will shine,And make you swear your beauty’s base to mine._Fortune._ Thou art too insolent; see, here’s a courtOf mortal judges; let’s by them be tried,Which of us three shall most be deified._Vice._ I am content._Fortune._ And I._Virtue._ So am not I.My judge shall be your sacred deity.[409][409] Virtue here evidently addressed Queen Elizabeth, as shesat in the audience; this direct recognition is kept up to theend of the play._Vice._ O miserable me, I am undone.      [_Exit_ VICE _and her train_._All._ O stop the horrid monster._Virtue._ Let her run.Fortune, who conquers now?_Fortune._ Virtue, I see,Thou wilt triumph both over her and me._All._ Empress of Heaven and earth._Fortune._ Why do you mock me?Kneel not to me, to her transfer your eyes,There sits the Queen of Chance, I bend my kneesLower than yours. Dread goddess, ’tis most meetThat Fortune fall down at thy conquering feet.Thou sacred Empress that command’st the Fates,Forgive what I have to thy handmaid done,And at thy chariot wheels Fortune shall run,And be thy captive, and to thee resignAll powers which Heaven’s large patent have made mine._Virtue._ Fortune, th’art vanquished. Sacred deity,O now pronounce who wins the victory,And yet that sentence needs not, since alone,Your virtuous presence Vice hath overthrown,Yet to confirm the conquest on your side,Look but on Fortunatus and his sons;Of all the wealth those gallants did possess,Only poor Shadow is left, comfortless:Their glory’s faded and their golden pride._Shad._ Only poor Shadow tells how poor they died._Virtue._ All that they had, or mortal men can have,Sends only but a Shadow from the grave.Virtue alone lives still, and lives in you;I am a counterfeit, you are the true;I am a shadow, at your feet I fall,Begging for these, and these, myself and all.All these that thus do kneel before your eyes,Are shadows like myself: dread nymph, it liesIn you to make us substances. O do it!Virtue I am sure you love, she wooes you to it.I read a verdict in your sun-like eyes,And this it is: Virtue the victory._All._ All loudly cry, Virtue the victory!_Fortune._ Virtue the victory! for joy of this,Those self-same hymns which you to Fortune sungLet them be now in Virtue’s honour rung.SONG.Virtue smiles: cry holiday,Dimples on her cheeks do dwell,Virtue frowns, cry welladay,Her love is Heaven, her hate is hell.Since Heaven and hell obey her power,Tremble when her eyes do lower.Since Heaven and hell her power obey,Where she smiles, cry holiday.    Holiday with joy we cry,    And bend, and bend, and merrily,    Sing hymns to Virtue’s deity:    Sing hymns to Virtue’s deity._As they are about to depart, enter ~Two Old Men~._THE EPILOGUE AT COURT.[410][410] See note 1 to Prologue._1st O. Man._ Nay stay, poor pilgrims, when I entered firstThe circle of this bright celestial sphere,I wept for joy, now I could weep for fear._2nd O. Man._ I fear we all like mortal men shall proveWeak, not in love, but in expressing love._1st O. Man._ Let every one beg once more on his knee,One pardon for himself, and one for me;For I enticed you hither. O dear Goddess,Breathe life in our numbed spirits with one smile,And from this cold earth, we with lively souls,Shall rise like men new-born, and make Heaven soundWith hymns sung to thy name, and prayers that weMay once a year so oft enjoy this sight,Till these young boys change their curled locks to white,And when gray-wingèd age sits on their heads,That so their children may supply their steads,And that Heaven’s great arithmetician,Who in the scales of number weighs the world,May still to forty-two add one year more,And still add one to one, that went before,And multiply four tens by many a ten:To this I cry, Amen._All._ Amen, amen!_1st O. Man._ Good-night, dear mistress, those that wish thee harm,Thus let them stoop under destruction’s arm._All._ Amen, amen, amen!      [_Exeunt._

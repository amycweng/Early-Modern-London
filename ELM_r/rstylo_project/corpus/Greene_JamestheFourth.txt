Author: Robert GreeneTitle: JAMES THE FOURTHThree of Greene's plays, _A Looking-Glass, Orlando Furioso_ and _FriarBacon_, are known to have been printed in 1594. Two plays, _JamesIV._ and _Friar Bacon_, were entered on the Stationers' Registers onthe same day, 14th May 1594. It is altogether probable that the firstprinting of _James IV._ occurred in the same year, though no trace ofsuch an edition has been found. The earliest extant Quarto is dated1598, and was printed by Thomas Creede. Of this two copies are known,one in the British Museum and one in the South Kensington Museum.Lowndes records a reprint of 1599, but none such has been discovered.The play is not mentioned by Henslowe, and there is no record of itsperformance. The text of the Quarto of 1598 is in very poor state,and shows indications that the play was either published from a stagecopy or that type was set by dictation. In V. 3, the King of Englandis called Arius, though elsewhere he is given his own title. In II.2 and III. 2, Ateukin is called Gnatho; in V. 2, Ateukin and Gnathoappear together. This last duplication of Ateukin and his Terentianprototype is held by Fleay to indicate another hand in the compositionof the play. Gnatho here, however, stands instead of Jaques. It shouldbe noticed that in the original story by Cinthio, the Capitano isequivalent to both Ateukin and Jaques. The confusion probably arosethen from an uncertainty in Greene's mind as to names rather than fromdouble authorship. In the hasty first composition Greene probablyused the well-known dramatic type-name for "sycophant," and was latercareless in substituting the name of his choice. The plot of the playis taken, as indicated by Mr P. A. Daniel in 1881, from the first novelof the third decade of Cinthio's _Hecatommithi_. The play makes nopretence to historical accuracy, and the title itself, in so far asit refers to Flodden Field, is misleading. Nevertheless the play isby some held to be "the finest Elizabethan historical play outside ofShakespeare." By its acted prologue and interplay it served as a modelfor Shakespeare's _Taming of the Shrew_ and _Midsummer Night's Dream_.DRAMATIS PERSONÆKING OF ENGLAND.LORD PERCY.SAMLES.KING OF SCOTS.LORD DOUGLAS.LORD MORTON.LORD ROSS.BISHOP OF ST ANDREWS.LORD EUSTACE.SIR BARTRAM.SIR CUTHBERT ANDERSON.ATEUKIN.JAQUES.A Lawyer.A Merchant.A Divine.SLIPPER,NANO, a dwarf,sons to BOHAN.ANDREW.Purveyor, Herald, Scout, Huntsmen, Soldiers, Revellers, etc.DOROTHEA, Queen of Scots.COUNTESS OF ARRAN.IDA, her daughter.LADY ANDERSON.Ladies, etc.OBERON, King of Fairies.BOHAN.Antics, Fairies, etc._JAMES THE FOURTH_[238]THE INDUCTION. _Music playing within. Enter after_ OBERON, _King of Fairies, an_ Antic,[239] _who dance about a tomb placed conveniently on the stage; out of which suddenly starts up, as they dance,_ BOHAN, _a Scot, attired like a ridstall_[240] _man, from whom the_ Antics _fly._ OBERON _remains.__Boh._ Ah say, what's thou?_Ober._ Thy friend, Bohan._Boh._ What wot I or reck I that? whay, guid man, I reck no friend noray reck no foe; als ene to me. Git thee ganging, and trouble not maywhayet,[241] or ays gar[242] thee recon me nene of thay friend, by theMary mass, sall I!_Ober._ Why, angry Scot, I visit thee for love; then what moves thee towrath?_Boh._ The de'il a whit reck I thy love; for I know too well that truelove took her flight twenty winter sence to heaven, whither till aycan, weel I wot, ay sal ne'er find love: an thou lovest me, leave me tomyself. But what were those puppets that hopped and skipped about meyear whayle?[243]_Ober._ My subjects._Boh._ Thay subjects! whay, art thou a king?_Ober._ I am._Boh._ The de'il thou art! whay, thou lookest not so big as the Kingof Clubs, nor so sharp as the King of Spades, nor so fain as the Kinga Daymonds: be the mass, ay take thee to be the king of false hearts;therefore I rid[244] thee away, or ayse so curry your kingdom thatyou's be glad to run to save your life._Ober._ Why, stoical Scot, do what thou darest to me: here is mybreast, strike._Boh._ Thou wilt not threap[245] me, this whinyard[246] has gard manybetter men to lope then thou! [_Tries to draw his sword._] But how now!Gos sayds, what, will't not out? Whay, thou witch, thou de'il! Gad'sfute, may whinyard!_Ober._ Why, pull, man: but what an 'twere out, how then?_Boh._ This, then,--thou weart best be gone first; for ay'l so lop thylimbs that thou's go with half a knave's carcass to the de'il._Ober._ Draw it out: now strike, fool, canst thou not?_Boh._ Bread ay gad, what de'il is in me? Whay, tell me, thou skipjack,what art thou?_Ober._ Nay, first tell me what thou wast from thy birth, what thouhast passed hitherto, why thou dwellest in a tomb and leavest theworld; and then I will release thee of these bonds; before, not._Boh._ And not before! then needs must, needs sall. I was born agentleman of the best blood in all Scotland, except the king. When timebrought me to age, and death took my parents, I became a courtier;where, though ay list not praise myself, ay engraved the memory ofBohan on the skin-coat of some of them, and revelled with the proudest._Ober._ But why, living in such reputation, didst thou leave to be acourtier?_Boh._ Because my pride was vanity, my expense loss, my reward fairwords and large promises, and my hopes spilt; for that after manyyears' service one outran me; and what the de'il should I then dothere? No, no; flattering knaves, that can cog and prate fastest, speedbest in the court._Ober._ To what life didst thou then betake thee?_Boh._ I then changed the court for the country, and the wars for awife: but I found the craft of swains more vile than the knavery ofcourtiers, the charge of children more heavy than servants, and wives'tongues worse than the wars itself; and therefore I gave o'er that, andwent to the city to dwell; and there I kept a great house with smallcheer, but all was ne'er the near.[247]_Ober._ And why?_Boh._ Because, in seeking friends, I found table-guests to eat me andmy meat, my wife's gossips to bewray the secrets of my heart, kindredto betray the effect of my life: which when I noted,--the court ill,the country worse, and the city worst of all,--in good time my wifedied, ay would she had died twenty winter sooner, by the mass! leavingmy two sons[248] to the world, and shutting myself into this tomb,where, if I die, I am sure I am safe from wild beasts, but, whilst Ilive, cannot be free from ill company. Besides, now I am sure, gif allmy friends fail me, I sall have a grave of mine own providing. This isall. Now, what art thou?_Ober._ Oberon, King of Fairies, that loves thee because thou hatestthe world; and, to gratulate thee, I brought these antics to show theesome sport in dancing, which thou hast loved well._Boh._ Ha, ha, ha! thinkest thou those puppets can please me? whay, Ihave two sons, that with one Scottish jig shall break the necks of thyantics._Ober._ That I would fain see._Boh._ Why, thou shalt.--Ho, boys! _Enter_ SLIPPER _and_ NANO.Haud your clacks,[249] lads; trattle not for thy life, but gather upyour legs, and dance me forthwith a jig worth the sight._Slip._ Why, I must talk, an I die for't: wherefore was my tongue made?_Boh._ Prattle, an thou darest, one word more, and ais dab thiswhinyard in thy wemb._Ober._ Be quiet, Bohan. I'll strike him dumb, and his brother too;their talk shall not hinder our jig.--Fall to it; dance, I say, man!_Boh._ Dance, Humer, dance, ay rid thee.[_The two dance a jig devised for the nonst._Now get you to the wide world with more than my father gave me; that'slearning enough both kinds, knavery and honesty; and that I gave you,spend at pleasure._Ober._ Nay, for their sport I will give them this gift: to the dwarfI give a quick wit, pretty of body, and awarrant his preferment to aprince's service, where by his wisdom he shall gain more love thancommon; and to loggerhead your son I give a wandering life, and promisehe shall never lack, and avow that, if in all distresses he call uponme, to help him. Now let them go. [_Exeunt_ SLIPPER _and_ NANO _withcourtesies.__Boh._ Now, king, if thou be a king, I will show thee whay I hate theworld by demonstration. In the year fifteen hundred and twenty, wasin Scotland a king, over-ruled with parasites, misled by lust, andmany circumstances too long to trattle on now, much like our court ofScotland this day. That story have I set down. Gang with me to thegallery, and I'll show thee the same in action by guid fellows of ourcountry-men; and then, when thou see'st that, judge if any wise manwould not leave the world if he could._Ober._ That will I see: lead, and I'll follow thee. [_Exeunt._    _Laus Deo detur in æternum._ACT THE FIRSTSCENE I.--_The Court at Edinburgh._ _Enter the_ KING OF ENGLAND, _the_ KING OF SCOTS, QUEEN DOROTHEA, _the_ COUNTESS OF ARRAN, IDA, _and_ Lords; _with them_ ATEUKIN, _aloof._    _K. of Scots._ Brother of England, since our neighbouring lands    And near alliance do invite our loves,    The more I think upon our last accord,    The more I grieve your sudden parting hence.    First, laws of friendship did confirm our peace;    Now both the seal of faith and marriage-bed,    The name of father, and the style of friend;    These force in me affection full confirm'd;    So that I grieve--and this my hearty grief    The heavens record, the world may witness well--    To lose your presence, who are now to me    A father, brother, and a vowèd friend.    _K. of Eng._ Link all these lovely styles, good king, in one:    And since thy grief exceeds in my depart,    I leave my Dorothea to enjoy    Thy whole compact [of] loves and plighted vows.    Brother of Scotland, this is my joy, my life,    Her father's honour, and her country's hope,    Her mother's comfort, and her husband's bliss:    I tell thee, king, in loving of my Doll,    Thou bind'st her father's heart, and all his friends,    In bands of love that death cannot dissolve.    _K. of Scots._ Nor can her father love her like to me,    My life's light, and the comfort of my soul.--    Fair Dorothea, that wast England's pride,    Welcome to Scotland; and, in sign of love,    Lo, I invest thee with the Scottish crown.--    Nobles and ladies, stoop unto your queen,    And trumpets sound, that heralds may proclaim    Fair Dorothea peerless Queen of Scots.    _All._ Long live and prosper our fair Queen of Scots!    [_They install and crown her._    _Q. Dor._ Thanks to the King of Kings for my dignity,    Thanks to my father, that provides so carefully;    Thanks to my lord and husband for this honour;    And thanks to all that love their king and me.    _All._ Long live fair Dorothea, our true queen!    _K. of Eng._ Long shine the sun of Scotland in her pride,    Her father's comfort, and fair Scotland's bride!    But, Dorothea, since I must depart,    And leave thee from thy tender mother's charge,    Let me advise my lovely daughter first    What best befits her in a foreign land.    Live, Doll, for many eyes shall look on thee    With care of honour and the present state;    For she that steps to height of majesty    Is even the mark whereat the enemy aims:    Thy virtues shall be construèd to vice,    Thine affable discourse to abject mind;    If coy, detracting tongues will call thee proud:    Be therefore wary in this slippery state;    Honour thy husband, love him as thy life,    Make choice of friends--as eagles of their young--    Who soothe no vice, who flatter not for gain,    But love such friends as do the truth maintain.    Think on these lessons when thou art alone,    And thou shalt live in health when I am gone.    _Q. Dor._ I will engrave these precepts in my heart:    And as the wind with calmness wooes you hence,    Even so I wish the heavens, in all mishaps,    May bless my father with continual grace.    _K. of Eng._ Then, son, farewell:    The favouring winds invite us to depart.    Long circumstance in taking princely leaves    Is more officious than convenient.    Brother of Scotland, love me in my child:    You greet me well, if so you will her good.    _K. of Scots._ Then, lovely Doll, and all that favour me,    Attend to see our English friends at sea:    Let all their charge depend upon my purse:    They are our neighbours, by whose kind accord    We dare attempt the proudest potentate.    Only, fair countess, and your daughter, stay;    With you I have some other thing to say.    [_Exeunt, in all royalty, the_ KING OF ENGLAND, QUEEN DOROTHEA    _and_ Lords.    [_Aside_]. So let them triumph that have cause to joy:    But, wretched king, thy nuptial knot is death,    Thy bride the breeder of thy country's ill;    For thy false heart dissenting from thy hand,    Misled by love, hath made another choice,--    Another choice, even when thou vow'd'st thy soul    To Dorothea, England's choicest pride.    O, then thy wandering eyes bewitch'd thy heart!    Even in the chapel did thy fancy change,    When, perjur'd man, though fair Doll had thy hand,    The Scottish Ida's beauty stale thy heart:    Yet fear and love have tied thy ready tongue    From babbling forth the passions of thy mind,    'Less fearful silence have in subtle looks    Bewray'd the treason of my new-vow'd love.    Be fair and lovely, Doll; but here's the prize,    That lodgeth here, and enter'd through mine eyes:    Yet, howso'er I love, I must be wise.--    Now, lovely countess, what reward or grace    May I employ on you for this your zeal,    And humble honours, done us in our court,    In entertainment of the English king?    _Count. of A._ It was of duty, prince, that I have done;    And what in favour may content me most,    Is, that it please your grace to give me leave    For to return unto my country-home.    _K. of Scots._ But, lovely Ida, is your mind the same?    _Ida._ I count of court, my lord, as wise men do,    'Tis fit for those that know what 'longs thereto:    Each person to his place; the wise to art,    The cobbler to his clout, the swain to cart.    _K. of Scots._ But, Ida, you are fair, and beauty shines,    And seemeth best, where pomp her pride refines.    _Ida._ If beauty, as I know there's none in me,    Were sworn my love, and I his life should be,    The farther from the court I were remov'd,    The more, I think, of heaven I were belov'd.    _K. of Scots._ And why?    _Ida._ Because the court is counted Venus' net,    Where gifts and vows for stales[250] are often set:    None, be she chaste as Vesta, but shall meet    A curious tongue to charm her ears with sweet.    _K. of Scots._ Why, Ida, then I see you set at naught    The force of love.    _Ida._ In sooth, this is my thought,    Most gracious king,--that they that little prove,    Are mickle blest, from bitter sweets of love.    And weel I wot, I heard a shepherd sing,    That, like a bee, love hath a little sting:    He lurks in flowers, he percheth on the trees,    He on kings' pillows bends his pretty knees;    The boy is blind, but when he will not spy,    He hath a leaden foot and wings to fly:    Beshrew me yet, for all these strange effects,    If I would like the lad that so infects.    _K. of Scots._ [_aside_].    Rare wit, fair face, what heart could more desire?    But Doll is fair and doth concern thee near:    Let Doll be fair, she is won; but I must woo    And win fair Ida; there's some choice in two.--    But, Ida, thou art coy.    _Ida._ And why, dread king?    _K. of Scots._ In that you will dispraise so sweet a thing    As love. Had I my wish--    _Ida._ What then?    _K. of Scots._ Then would I place    His arrow here, his beauty in that face.    _Ida._ And were Apollo mov'd and rul'd by me,    His wisdom should be yours, and mine his tree.    _K. of Scots._ But here returns our train.     _Re-enter_ QUEEN DOROTHEA _and_ Lords.                                Welcome, fair Doll!    How fares our father? is he shipp'd and gone?    _Q. Dor._ My royal father is both shipp'd and gone:    God and fair winds direct him to his home!    _K. of Scots._ Amen, say I.--[_Aside_]. Would thou wert with him too!    Then might I have a fitter time to woo.--    But, countess, you would be gone, therefore, farewell,--    Yet, Ida, if thou wilt, stay thou behind    To accompany my queen:    But if thou like the pleasures of the court,--    [_Aside_]. Or if she lik'd me, though she left the court,--    What should I say? I know not what to say.--    You may depart:--and you, my courteous queen,    Leave me a space; I have a weighty cause    To think upon:--[_Aside_]. Ida, it nips me near;    It came from thence, I feel it burning here.    [_Exeunt all except the_ KING OF SCOTS _and_ ATEUKIN.    Now am I free from sight of common eye,    Where to myself I may disclose the grief    That hath too great a part in mine affects.    _Ateu._ [_aside_]. And now is my time by wiles and words to rise,    Greater than those that think themselves more wise.    _K. of Scots._ And first, fond king, thy honour doth engrave    Upon thy brows the drift of thy disgrace.    Thy new-vow'd love, in sight of God and men,    Links thee to Dorothea during life;    For who more fair and virtuous than thy wife?    Deceitful murderer of a quiet mind,    Fond love, vile lust, that thus misleads us men    To vow our faiths, and fall to sin again!    But kings stoop not to every common thought:    Ida is fair and wise, fit for a king;    And for fair Ida will I hazard life,    Venture my kingdom, country, and my crown:    Such fire hath love to burn a kingdom down.    Say Doll dislikes that I estrange my love:    Am I obedient to a woman's look?    Nay, say her father frown when he shall hear    That I do hold fair Ida's love so dear:    Let father frown and fret, and fret and die,    Nor earth nor heaven shall part my love and I.--    Yea, they shall part us, but we first must meet,    And woo and win, and yet the world not see't.--    Yea, there's the wound, and wounded with that thought,    So let me die, for all my drift is naught!    _Ateu._ [_coming forward_]. Most gracious and imperial majesty,--    [_Aside_]. A little flattery more were but too much.    _K. of Scots._ Villain, what art thou    That thus dar'st interrupt a prince's secrets?    _Ateu._ Dread king, thy vassal is a man of art,    Who knows, by constellation of the stars,    By oppositions and by dire aspécts,    The things are past and those that are to come.    _K. of Scots._ But where's thy warrant to approach my presence?    _Ateu._ My zeal, and ruth to see your grace's wrong,    Make me lament I did detract[251] so long.    _K. of Scots._ If thou know'st thoughts, tell me, what mean I now?    _Ateu._ I'll calculate the cause    Of those your highness' smiles, and tell your thoughts.    _K. of Scots._ But lest thou spend thy time in idleness,    And miss the matter that my mind aims at,    Tell me: what star was opposite when that was thought?    [_Strikes him on the ear._    _Ateu._ 'Tis inconvenient, mighty potentate,    Whose looks resemble Jove in majesty,    To scorn the sooth of science with contempt.    I see in those imperial looks of yours    The whole discourse of love: Saturn combust,    With direful looks, at your nativity    Beheld fair Venus in her silver orb:    I know, by certain axioms I have read,    Your grace's griefs, and further can express    Her name that holds you thus in fancy's bands.    _K. of Scots._ Thou talkest wonders.    _Ateu._ Naught but truth, O king.    'Tis Ida is the mistress of your heart,    Whose youth must take impression of affects;    For tender twigs will bow, and milder minds    Will yield to fancy, be they follow'd well.    _K. of Scots._ What god art thou, compos'd in human shape,    Or bold Trophonius, to decide our doubts?    How know'st thou this?    _Ateu._ Even as I know the means    To work your grace's freedom and your love.    Had I the mind, as many courtiers have,    To creep into your bosom for your coin,    And beg rewards for every cap and knee,    I then would say, "If that your grace would give    This lease, this manor, or this patent seal'd,    For this or that I would effect your love:"    But Ateukin is no parasite, O prince.    I know your grace knows scholars are but poor;    And therefore, as I blush to beg a fee,    Your mightiness is so magnificent,    You cannot choose but cast some gift apart,    To ease my bashful need that cannot beg.    As for your love, O, might I be employ'd,    How faithfully would Ateukin compass it!    But princes rather trust a smoothing tongue    Than men of art that can accept the time.    _K. of Scots._ Ateukin,--if so thy name, for so thou say'st,--    Thine art appears in entrance of my love;    And, since I deem thy wisdom match'd with truth,    I will exalt thee; and thyself alone    Shalt be the agent to dissolve my grief.    Sooth is, I love, and Ida is my love;    But my new marriage nips me near, Ateukin,    For Dorothea may not brook th' abuse.    _Ateu._ These lets are but as motes against the sun,    Yet not so great; like dust before the wind,    Yet not so light. Tut, pacify your grace:    You have the sword and sceptre in your hand;    You are the king, the state depends on you;    Your will is law. Say that the case were mine:    Were she my sister whom your highness loves,    She should consent, for that our lives, our goods,    Depend on you; and if your queen repine,    Although my nature cannot brook of blood,    And scholars grieve to hear of murderous deeds,--    But if the lamb should let the lion's way,    By my advice the lamb should lose her life.    Thus am I bold to speak unto your grace,    Who am too base to kiss your royal feet;    For I am poor, nor have I land nor rent,    Nor countenance here in court; but for my love,    Your grace shall find none such within the realm.    _K. of Scots._ Wilt thou effect my love? shall she be mine?    _Ateu._ I'll gather moly, crocus, and the herbs    That heal the wounds of body and the mind;    I'll set out charms and spells; naught else shall be left    To tame the wanton if she shall rebel:    Give me but tokens of your highness' trust.    _K. of Scots._ Thou shalt have gold, honour, and wealth enough;    Win my love, and I will make thee great.    _Ateu._ These words do make me rich, most noble prince;    I am more proud of them than any wealth.    Did not your grace suppose I flatter you,    Believe me, I would boldly publish this;--    Was never eye that saw a sweeter face,    Nor never ear that heard a deeper wit:    O God, how I am ravish'd in your worth!    _K. of Scots._ Ateukin, follow me; love must have ease.    _Ateu._ I'll kiss your highness' feet; march when you please.    [_Exeunt._SCENE II.--_Public Place in Edinburgh._ _Enter_ SLIPPER, NANO, _and_ ANDREW, _with their bills, ready written, in their hands.__And._ Stand back, sir; mine shall stand highest._Slip._ Come under mine arm, sir, or get a footstool; or else, by thelight of the moon, I must come to it._Nano._ Agree, my masters; every man to his height: though I standlowest, I hope to get the best master._And._ Ere I will stoop to a thistle, I will change turns; as good luckcomes on the right hand as the left: here's for me._Slip._ And me._Nano._ And mine. [_They set up their bills.__And._ But tell me, fellows, till better occasion come, do you seekmasters?_Slip. Nano._ We do._And._ But what can you do worthy preferment?_Nano._ Marry, I can smell a knave from a rat._Slip._ And I can lick a dish before a cat._And._ And I can find two fools unsought,--how like you that?But, in earnest now, tell me: of what trades are you two?_Slip._ How mean you that, sir, of what trade? Marry, I'll tell you,I have many trades: the honest trade when I needs must; the filchingtrade when time serves; the cozening trade as I find occasion. And Ihave more qualities: I cannot abide a full cup unkissed, a fat caponuncarved, a full purse unpicked, nor a fool to prove a justice as youdo._And._ Why, sot, why callest thou me fool?_Nano._ For examining wiser than thyself._And._ So doth many more than I in Scotland._Nano._ Yea, those are such as have more authority than wit, and morewealth than honesty._Slip._ This is my little brother with the great wit; 'ware him!--Butwhat canst thou do, tell me, that art so inquisitive of us?_And._ Anything that concerns a gentleman to do, that can I do._Slip._ So you are of the gentle trade?_And._ True._Slip._ Then, gentle sir, leave us to ourselves, for here comes one asif he would lack a servant ere he went. [ANDREW _stands aside._ _Enter_ ATEUKIN.    _Ateu._ Why, so, Ateukin, this becomes thee best:    Wealth, honour, ease, and angels in thy chest.    Now may I say, as many often sing,    "No fishing to[252] the sea, nor service to a king."    Unto this high promotion doth belong    Means to be talk'd of in the thickest throng.    And first, to fit the humours of my lord,    Sweet lays and lines of love I must record;    And such sweet lines and love-lays I'll indite,    As men may wish for, and my liege delight:    And next, a train of gallants at my heels,    That men may say, the world doth run on wheels;    For men of art, that rise by indirection    To honour and the favour of their king,    Must use all means to save what they have got,    And win their favours whom they never knew.    If any frown to see my fortunes such,    A man must bear a little,--not too much!    But, in good time!--these bills portend, I think,    That some good fellows do for service seek. [_Reads.__If any gentleman, spiritual or temporal, will entertain out of hisservice, a young stripling of the age of thirty years, that can sleepwith the soundest, eat with the hungriest, work with the sickest, liewith the loudest, face with the proudest, etc., that can wait in agentleman's chamber when his master is a mile off, keep his stable when'tis empty, and his purse when 'tis full, and hath many qualities worsethan all these, let him write his name and go his way, and attendanceshall be given._By my faith, a good servant: which is he?_Slip._ Truly, sir, that am I._Ateu._ And why dost thou write such a bill? Are all these qualities inthee?_Slip._ O Lord, ay, sir, and a great many more, some better, someworse, some richer, some poorer. Why, sir, do you look so? do they notplease you?_Ateu._ Truly, no, for they are naught, and so art thou: if thou hastno better qualities, stand by._Slip._ O, sir, I tell the worst first; but, an you lack a man, I amfor you: I'll tell you the best qualities I have._Ateu._ Be brief, then._Slip._ If you need me in your chamber, I can keep the door at awhistle; in your kitchen, turn the spit, and lick the pan, and make thefire burn; but if in the stable,--_Ateu._ Yea, there would I use thee._Slip._ Why, there you kill me, there am I! and turn me to a horse anda wench, and I have no peer._Ateu._ Art thou so good in keeping a horse? I pray thee, tell me howmany good qualities hath a horse._Slip._ Why, so, sir: a horse hath two properties of a man, that is, aproud heart, and a hardy stomach; four properties of a lion, a broadbreast, a stiff docket,--hold your nose, master,--a wild countenance,and four good legs; nine properties of a fox, nine of a hare, nine ofan ass, and ten of a woman._Ateu._ A woman! why, what properties of a woman hath a horse?_Slip._ O, master, know you not that? Draw your tables,[253] and writewhat wise I speak. First, a merry countenance; second, a soft pace;third, a broad forehead; fourth, broad buttocks; fifth, hard of ward;sixth, easy to leap upon; seventh, good at long journey; eighth, movingunder a man; ninth, always busy with the mouth; tenth, ever chewing onthe bridle._Ateu._ Thou art a man for me: what's thy name?_Slip._ An ancient name, sir, belonging to the chamber and thenight-gown: guess you that._Ateu._ What's that? Slipper?_Slip._ By my faith, well guessed; and so 'tis indeed. You'll be mymaster?_Ateu._ I mean so._Slip._ Read this first._Ateu._ [_reads_]. _Pleaseth it any gentleman to entertain a servantof more wit than stature, let them subscribe, and attendance shall begiven._What of this?_Slip._ He is my brother, sir; and we two were born together, mustserve together, and will die together, though we be both hanged._Ateu._ What's thy name?_Nano._ Nano._Ateu._ The etymology of which word is "a dwarf." Are not thou the oldstoic's son that dwells in his tomb?_Slip. Nano._ We are._Ateu._ Thou art welcome to me. Wilt thou give thyself wholly to be atmy disposition?_Nano._ In all humility I submit myself._Ateu._ Then will I deck thee princely, instruct thee courtly, andpresent thee to the queen as my gift. Art thou content?_Nano._ Yes, and thank your honour too._Slip._ Then welcome, brother, and follow now._And._ [_coming forward_]. May it please your honour to abase your eyeso low as to look either on my bill or myself?_Ateu._ What are you?_And._ By birth a gentleman; in profession a scholar; and one that knewyour honour in Edinburgh, before your worthiness called you to thisreputation: by me, Andrew Snoord._Ateu._ Andrew, I remember thee; follow me, and we will conferfurther; for my weighty affairs for the king command me to be brief atthis time.--Come on, Nano.--Slipper, follow.

God shield, Sir Bartram, that were ill,    To leave my wife and wander thus astray:    But time and good advice, ere many years,    May chance to make my fancy bend that way.    What news in Scotland? therefore came I hither,    To see your country and to chat together.    _Sir Bar._ Why, man, our country's blithe, our king is well,    Our queen so-so, the nobles well and worse,    And weel are they that are about the king,    But better are the country gentlemen:    And I may tell thee, Eustace, in our lives    We old men never saw so wondrous change.    But leave this trattle, and tell me what news    In lovely England with our honest friends.    _Eust._ The king, the court, and all our noble friends    Are well; and God in mercy keep them so!    The northern lords and ladies hereabouts,    That know I came to see your queen and court,    Commend them to my honest friend Sir Bartram,--    And many others that I have not seen.    Among the rest, the Countess Elinor,    From Carlisle, where we merry oft have been,    Greets well my lord, and hath directed me,    By message, this fair lady's face to see.    [_Shows a portrait._    _Sir Bar._ I tell thee, Eustace, 'less mine old eyes daze,    This is our Scottish moon and evening's pride;    This is the blemish of your English bride.    Who sail by her, are sure of wind at will;    Her face is dangerous, her sight is ill:    And yet, in sooth, sweet Dick, it may be said,    The king hath folly, there's virtue in the maid.    _Eust._ But knows my friend this portrait? be advis'd.    _Sir Bar._ Is it not Ida, the Countess of Arran's daughter's?    _Eust._ So was I told by Elinor of Carlisle:    But tell me, lovely Bartram: is the maid    Evil-inclin'd, misled, or concubine    Unto the king or any other lord?    _Sir Bar._ Should I be brief and true, than thus, my Dick:    All England's grounds yield not a blither lass,    Nor Europe can surpass her for her gifts    Of virtue, honour, beauty, and the rest:    But our fond king, not knowing sin in lust,    Makes love by endless means and precious gifts;    And men that see it dare not say't, my friend,    But we may wish that it were otherwise.    But I rid thee to view the picture still,    For by the person's sight there hangs some ill.    _Eust._ O, good Sir Bartram, you suspect I love    (Then were I mad) her whom I never saw.    But, howsoe'er, I fear not enticings:    Desire will give no place unto a king:    I'll see her whom the world admires so much,    That I may say with them, "There lives none such."    _Sir Bar._ Be Gad, and sall both see and talk with her;    And, when thou'st done, whate'er her beauty be,    I'll warrant thee her virtues may compare    With the proudest she that waits upon your queen.     _Enter_ Servant.    _Serv._ My lady entreats your worship in to supper.    _Sir Bar._ Guid, bonny Dick, my wife will tell thee more:    Was never no man in her book before;    Be Gad, she's blithe, fair, lewely,[256] bonny, etc.[257]    [_Exeunt._    CHORUS[258]     _Enter_ BOHAN _and_ OBERON; _to them a round of_ Fairies, _or some     pretty dance._    _Boh._ Be Gad, gramercies, little king, for this;    This sport is better in my exile life    Than ever the deceitful werld could yield.    _Ober._ I tell thee, Bohan, Oberon is king    Of quiet, pleasure, profit, and content,    Of wealth, of honour, and of all the world;    Tied to no place,--yet all are tied to one.    Live thou this life, exil'd from world and men,    And I will show thee wonders ere we part.    _Boh._ Then mark my story, and the strange doubts    That follow flatterers, lust, and lawless will,    And then say I have reason to forsake    The world and all that are within the same.    Go shroud us in our harbour, where we'll see    The pride of folly, as it ought to be.

[_All exeunt._ _Enter the_ King _in great pomp, who reads it, and issueth, crying,_ "Ver meum."_Boh._ What meaneth this?    _Ober._ Cyrus of Persia,    Mighty in life, within a marble grave    Was laid to rot; whom Alexander once    Beheld entomb'd, and weeping did confess,    Nothing in life could 'scape from wretchedness:    Why, then, boast men?    _Boh._ What reck I, then, of life,    Who make the grave my home, the earth my wife?    But mark me more.3._Boh._ I can no more; my patience will not warpTo see these flatterers how they scorn and carp._Ober._ Turn but thy head. _Enter four_ Kings _carrying crowns_, Ladies _presenting odours to_ Potentate _enthroned, who suddenly is slain by his_ Servants _and thrust out; and so they eat._ [_Exeunt.__Boh._ Sike is the werld; but whilk is he I saw?_Ober._ Sesostris, who was conqueror of the world,Slain at the last and stamp'd on by his slaves._Boh._ How blest are peur men, then, that know their graves!Now mark the sequel of my jig.(4.)[260]    _Boh._ An he weel meet ends.

[_Exeunt._ACT THE SECONDSCENE I.--_Porch to the Castle of the_ COUNTESS OF ARRAN. _The_ COUNTESS OF ARRAN _and_ IDA _discovered sitting at work._ _A Song._[261]_Count. of A._ Fair Ida, might you choose the greatest good,'Midst all the world in blessings that abound,Wherein, my daughter, should your liking be?_Ida._ Not in delights, or pomp, or majesty._Count. of A._ And why?_Ida._ Since these are means to draw the mindFrom perfect good, and make true judgment blind._Count. of A._ Might you have wealth and fortune's richest store?    _Ida._ Yet would I, might I choose, be honest-poor;    For she that sits at fortune's feet a-low    Is sure she shall not taste a further woe;    But those that prank on top of fortune's ball    Still fear a change, and, fearing, catch a fall._Count. of A._ Tut, foolish maid, each one contemneth need._Ida._ Good reason why, they know not good indeed._Count. of A._ Many, marry, then, on whom distress doth lour.    _Ida._ Yes, they that virtue deem an honest dower.    Madam, by right this world I may compare    Unto my work, wherein with heedful care    The heavenly workman plants with curious hand--    As I with needle draw--each thing on land    Even as he list: some men like to the rose    Are fashion'd fresh; some in their stalks do close,    And, born, do sudden die; some are but weeds,    And yet from them a secret good proceeds:    I with my needle, if I please, may blot    The fairest rose within my cambric plot;    God with a beck can change each worldly thing,    The poor to earth, the beggar to the king.    What, then, hath man wherein he well may boast,    Since by a beck he lives, a lour[262] is lost?_Count. of A._ Peace, Ida, here are strangers near at hand. _Enter_ EUSTACE _with letters.__Eust._ Madam, God speed!_Count. of A._ I thank you, gentle squire.    _Eust._ The country Countess of Northumberland    Doth greet you well; and hath requested me    To bring these letters to your ladyship.    [_Delivers the letters._    _Count. of A._ I thank her honour, and yourself, my friend.    [_Peruses them._    I see she means you good, brave gentleman.--    Daughter, the Lady Elinor salutes    Yourself as well as me: then for her sake    'Twere good you entertain'd that courtier well.    _Ida._ As much salute as may become my sex,    And he in virtue can vouchsafe to think,    I yield him for the courteous countess' sake.--    Good sir, sit down: my mother here and I    Count time misspent an endless vanity._Eust._ [_aside_]. Beyond report, the wit, the fair, the shape!--What work you here, fair mistress? may I see it?    _Ida._ Good sir, look on: how like you this compáct?    _Eust._ Methinks in this I see true love in act:    The woodbines with their leaves do sweetly spread,    The roses blushing prank them in their red;    No flower but boasts the beauties of the spring;    This bird hath life indeed, if it could sing.    What means, fair mistress, had you in this work?    _Ida._ My needle, sir.    _Eust._ In needles, then, there lurk    Some hidden grace, I deem, beyond my reach.    _Ida._ Not grace in them, good sir, but those that teach.    _Eust._ Say that your needle now were Cupid's sting,--    [_Aside_]. But, ah, her eye must be no less,    In which is heaven and heavenliness,    In which the food of God is shut,    Whose powers the purest minds do glut!    _Ida._ What if it were?    _Eust._ Then see a wondrous thing;    I fear me you would paint in Tereus' heart    Affection in his power and chiefest part.    _Ida._ Good Lord, sir, no! for hearts but prickèd soft    Are wounded sore, for so I hear it oft.    _Eust._ What recks the wound, where but your happy eye    May make him live whom Jove hath judg'd to die?    _Ida._ Should life and death within this needle lurk,    I'll prick no hearts, I'll prick upon my work.     _Enter_ ATEUKIN _and_ SLIPPER.    _Count. of A._ Peace, Ida, I perceive the fox at hand.    _Eust._ The fox! why, fetch your hounds, and chase him hence.    _Count. of A._ O, sir, these great men bark at small offence.    Come, will it please you enter, gentle sir?    [_They offer to go out._    _Ateu._ Stay, courteous ladies; favour me so much    As to discourse a word or two apart.    _Count. of A._ Good sir, my daughter learns this rule of me,    To shun resort and strangers' company;    For some are shifting mates that carry letters;    Some, such as you, too good because our betters.    _Slip._ Now, I pray you, sir, what akin are you to a pickerel?    _Ateu._ Why, knave?_Slip._ By my troth, sir, because I never knew a proper situationfellow of your pitch fitter to swallow a gudgeon._Ateu._ What meanest thou by this?_Slip._ "Shifting fellow," sir,--these be thy words;[263] "shiftingfellow": this gentlewoman, I fear me, knew your bringing up._Ateu._ How so?_Slip._ Why, sir, your father was a miller, that could shift for a peckof grist in a bushel, and you a fair-spoken gentleman, that can getmore land by a lie than an honest man by his ready money._Ateu._ Caitiff, what sayest thou?_Slip._ I say, sir, that if she call you shifting knave, you shall notput her to the proof._Ateu._ And why?_Slip._ Because, sir, living by your wit as you do, shifting is yourletters-patents: it were a hard matter for me to get my dinner thatday wherein my master had not sold a dozen of devices, a case ofcogs, and a suit of shifts,[264] in the morning. I speak this in yourcommendation, sir, and, I pray you, so take it._Ateu._ If I live, knave, I will be revenged. What gentleman wouldentertain a rascal thus to derogate from his honour? [_Beats him.__Ida._ My lord, why are you thus impatient?    _Ateu._ Not angry, Ida; but I teach this knave    How to behave himself among his betters.--    Behold, fair countess, to assure your stay,    I here present the signet of the king,    Who now by me, fair Ida, doth salute you:    And since in secret I have certain things    In his behalf, good madam, to impart,    I crave your daughter to discourse apart.    _Count. of A._ She shall in humble duty be addrest[265]    To do his highness' will in what she may.    _Ida._ Now, gentle sir, what would his grace with me?    _Ateu._ Fair, comely nymph, the beauty of your face,    Sufficient to bewitch the heavenly powers,    Hath wrought so much in him, that now of late    He finds himself made captive unto love;    And though his power and majesty require    A straight command before an humble suit,    Yet he his mightiness doth so abase    As to entreat your favour, honest maid.    _Ida._ Is he not married, sir, unto our queen?    _Ateu._ He is.    _Ida._ And are not they by God accurs'd,    That sever them whom he hath knit in one?    _Ateu._ They be: what then? we seek not to displace    The princess from her seat; but, since by love    The king is made your own, he is resolv'd    In private to accept your dalliance,    In spite of war, watch, or worldly eye.    _Ida._ O, how he talks, as if he should not die!    As if that God in justice once could wink    Upon that fault I am asham'd to think!    _Ateu._ Tut, mistress, man at first was born to err;    Women are all not formèd to be saints:    'Tis impious for to kill our native king,    Whom by a little favour we may save.    _Ida._ Better, than live unchaste, to lie in grave.    _Ateu._ He shall erect your state, and wed you well.    _Ida._ But can his warrant keep my soul from hell?    _Ateu._ He will enforce, if you resist his suit.    _Ida._ What tho?[266] The world may shame to him account,    To be a king of men and worldly pelf,    Yet hath no power to rule and guide himself.    _Ateu._ I know you, gentle lady, and the care    Both of your honour and his grace's health    Makes me confusèd in this dangerous state.    _Ida._ So counsel him, but soothe thou not his sin:    'Tis vain allurement that doth make him love:    I shame to hear, be you asham'd to move.    _Count. of A._ [_aside_]. I see my daughter grows impatient:    I fear me, he pretends some bad intent.    _Ateu._ Will you despise the king and scorn him so?    _Ida._ In all allegiance I will serve his grace,    But not in lust: O, how I blush to name it!_Ateu._ [_aside_]. An endless work is this: how should I frame it?[_They discourse privately.__Slip._ O, mistress, may I turn a word upon you?_Count. of A._ Friend, what wilt thou?_Slip._ O, what a happy gentlewoman be you truly! the world reportsthis of you, mistress, that a man can no sooner come to your house butthe butler comes with a black-jack and says, "Welcome, friend, here'sa cup of the best for you": verily, mistress, you are said to have thebest ale in all Scotland._Count. of A._ Sirrah, go fetch him drink. [Servant _brings drink_].How likest thou this?_Slip._ Like it, mistress! why, this is quincy quarie, pepper dewatchet, single goby, of all that ever I tasted! I'll prove in thisale and toast the compass of the whole world. First, this is theearth,--it lies in the middle, a fair brown toast, a goodly country forhungry teeth to dwell upon; next, this is the sea, a fair pool for adry tongue to fish in: now come I, and, seeing the world is naught, Idivide it thus; and, because the sea cannot stand without the earth, asAristotle saith, I put them both into their first chaos, which is mybelly: and so, mistress, you may see your ale is become a miracle._Eust._ A merry mate, madam, I promise you._Count. of A._ Why sigh you, sirrah?_Slip._ Truly, madam, to think upon the world, which, since I denouncedit, keeps such a rumbling in my stomach, that, unless your cook giveit a counterbuff with some of your roasted capons or beef, I fear meI shall become a loose body, so dainty, I think, I shall neither holdfast before nor behind.    _Count. of A._ Go take him in, and feast this merry swain.--    Sirrah, my cook is your physician;    He hath a purge for to digest the world.    [_Exeunt_ SLIPPER _and_ Servant._Ateu._ Will you not, Ida, grant his highness this?    _Ida._ As I have said, in duty I am his:    For other lawless lusts that ill beseem him,    I cannot like, and good I will not deem him.    _Count. of A._ Ida, come in:--and, sir, if so you please,    Come, take a homely widow's entertain.    _Ida._ If he have no great haste, he may come nigh;    If haste, though he be gone, I will not cry.    [_Exeunt_ COUNTESS OF ARRAN, IDA, _and_ EUSTACE.    _Ateu._ I see this labour lost, my hope in vain;    Yet will I try another drift again. [_Exit._SCENE II.--_The Court at Edinburgh._ _Enter, one by one, the_ BISHOP OF ST ANDREWS, DOUGLAS, MORTON, _and others, one way_; QUEEN DOROTHEA _with_ NANO, _another way.__Bp. of St And._ [_aside_]. O wrack of commonweal! O wretched state!_Doug._ [_aside_]. O hapless flock, whereas the guide is blind!_Mort._ [_aside_]. O heedless youth, where counsel is despis'd![_They are all in a muse._    _Q. Dor._ Come, pretty knave, and prank it by my side;    Let's see your best attendance out of hand.    _Nano._ Madam, although my limbs are very small,    My heart is good; I'll serve you therewithal.    _Q. Dor._ How, if I were assail'd, what couldst thou do?    _Nano._ Madam, call help, and boldly fight it too:    Although a bee be but a little thing,    You know, fair queen, it hath a bitter sting._Q. Dor._ How couldst thou do me good, were I in grief?    _Nano._ Counsel, dear princess, is a choice relief:    Though Nestor wanted force, great was his wit;    And though I am but weak, my words are fit.    _Bp. of St And._ [_aside_]. Like to a ship upon the ocean-seas,    Tost in the doubtful stream, without a helm,    Such is a monarch without good advice.    I am o'erheard: cast rein upon thy tongue;    Andrews, beware; reproof will breed a scar.    _Mort._ Good-day, my lord.    _Bp. of St And._ Lord Morton, well y-met.--    Whereon deems Lord Douglas all this while?    _Doug._ Of that which yours and my poor heart doth break,    Although fear shuts our mouths, we dare not speak.    _Q. Dor._ [_aside_]. What mean these princes sadly to consult?    Somewhat, I fear, betideth them amiss,    They are so pale in looks, so vex'd in mind.--    In happy hour, the noble Scottish peers,    Have I encounter'd you: what makes you mourn?    _Bp. of St And._ If we with patience may attention gain,    Your grace shall know the cause of all our grief.    _Q. Dor._ Speak on, good father: come and sit by me:    I know thy care is for the common good.    _Bp. of St And._ As fortune, mighty princess, reareth some    To high estate and place in commonweal,    So by divine bequest to them is lent    A riper judgment and more searching eye,    Whereby they may discern the common harm;    For where our fortunes in the world are most,    Where all our profits rise and still increase,    There is our mind, thereon we meditate,--    And what we do partake of good advice,    That we employ for to concern the same.    To this intent, these nobles and myself,    That are, or should be, eyes of commonweal,    Seeing his highness' reckless course of youth,    His lawless and unbridled vein in love,    His too intentive trust to flatterers,    His abject care of counsel and his friends,    Cannot but grieve; and, since we cannot draw    His eye or judgment to discern his faults,    Since we have spoke and counsel is not heard,    I, for my part,--let others as they list,--    Will leave the court, and leave him to his will,    Lest with a ruthful eye I should behold    His overthrow, which, sore I fear, is nigh.    _Q. Dor._ Ah, father, are you so estrang'd from love,    From due allegiance to your prince and land,    To leave your king when most he needs your help?    The thrifty husbandmen are never wont,    That see their lands unfruitful, to forsake them;    But, when the mould is barren and unapt,    They toil, they plow, and make the fallow fat:    The pilot in the dangerous seas is known;    In calmer waves the silly sailor strives.    Are you not members, lords, of commonweal,    And can your head, your dear anointed king,    Default, ye lords, except yourselves do fail?    O, stay your steps, return and counsel him!    _Doug._ Men seek not moss upon a rolling stone,    Or water from the sieve, or fire from ice,    Or comfort from a reckless monarch's hands.    Madam, he sets us light, that serv'd in court,    In place of credit, in his father's days:    If we but enter presence of his grace,    Our payment is a frown, a scoff, a frump;    Whilst flattering Gnatho[267] pranks it by his side,    Soothing the careless king in his misdeeds:    And, if your grace consider your estate,    His life should urge you too, if all be true.    _Q. Dor._ Why, Douglas, why?    _Doug._ As if you have not heard    His lawless love to Ida grown of late,    His careless estimate of your estate.    _Q. Dor._ Ah, Douglas, thou misconster'st his intent!    He doth but tempt his wife, he tries my love;    This injury pertains to me, not to you.    The king is young; and, if he step awry,    He may amend, and I will love him still.    Should we disdain our vines because they sprout    Before their time? or young men, if they strain    Beyond their reach? No; vines that bloom and spread    Do promise fruits, and young men that are wild    In age grow wise. My friends and Scottish peers,    If that an English princess may prevail,    Stay, stay with him: lo, how my zealous prayer    Is plead with tears! fie, peers, will you hence?    _Bp. of St And._ Madam, 'tis virtue in your grace to plead;    But we, that see his vain untoward course,    Cannot but fly the fire before it burn,    And shun the court before we see his fall.    _Q. Dor._ Will you not stay? then, lordings, fare you well.    Though you forsake your king, the heavens, I hope,    Will favour him through mine incessant prayer.    _Nano._ Content you, madam; thus old Ovid sings,    'Tis foolish to bewail recureless things.    _Q. Dor._ Peace, dwarf; these words my patience move.    _Nano._ Although you charm my speech, charm not my love.    [_Exeunt_ QUEEN DOROTHEA _and_ NANO.     _Enter the_ KING OF SCOTS; _the_ Nobles, _spying him as they are about     to go off, return._    _K. of Scots._ Douglas, how now! why changest thou thy cheer?    _Doug._ My private troubles are so great, my liege,    As I must crave your license for awhile,    For to intend mine own affairs at home.    _K. of Scots._ You may depart. [_Exit_ DOUGLAS.] But why is Morton sad?    _Mort._ The like occasion doth import me too:    So I desire your grace to give me leave.    _K. of Scots._ Well, sir, you may betake you to your ease.    [_Exit_ MORTON.    [_Aside_]. When such grim sirs are gone, I see no let    To work my will.    _Bp. of St And._ What, like the eagle, then,    With often flight wilt thou thy feathers lose?    O king, canst thou endure to see thy court    Of finest wits and judgments dispossess'd,    Whilst cloaking craft with soothing climbs so high    As each bewails ambition is so bad?    Thy father left thee with estate and crown,    A learnèd council to direct thy course:    These carelessly, O king, thou castest off,    To entertain a train of sycophants.    Thou well may'st see, although thou wilt not see,    That every eye and ear both sees and hears    The certain signs of thine incontinence.    Thou art allied unto the English king    By marriage;--a happy friend indeed,    If usèd well; if not, a mighty foe.    Thinketh your grace, he can endure and brook    To have a partner in his daughter's love?    Thinketh your grace, the grudge of privy wrongs    Will not procure him change his smiles to threats?    O, be not blind to good! call home your lords,    Displace these flattering Gnathoes, drive them hence!    Love and with kindness take your wedlock wife;    Or else, which God forbid, I fear a change:    Sin cannot thrive in courts without a plague.    _K. of Scots._ Go pack thou too, unless thou mend thy talk!    On pain of death, proud bishop, get you gone,    Unless you headless mean to hop away!    _Bp. of St And._ Thou God of heaven, prevent my country's fall!    [_Exit with other_ Nobles.    _K. of Scots._ These stays and lets to pleasure plague my thoughts,    Forcing my grievous wounds anew to bleed;    But care that hath transported me so far,    Fair Ida, is dispers'd in thought of thee,    Whose answer yields me life or breeds my death.    Yond comes the messenger of weal or woe.     _Enter_ ATEUKIN.[268]    Ateukin, what news?    _Ateu._ The adamant, O king, will not be fil'd    But by itself, and beauty that exceeds    By some exceeding favour must be wrought:    Ida is coy as yet, and doth repine,    Objecting marriage, honour, fear and death:    She's holy-wise, and too precise for me.    _K. of Scots._ Are these thy fruits of wit, thy sight in art,    Thine eloquence, thy policy, thy drift,--    To mock thy prince? Then, caitiff, pack thee hence,    And let me die devourèd in my love!    _Ateu._ Good lord, how rage gainsayeth reason's power!    My dear, my gracious, and belovèd prince,    The essence of my soul, my god on earth,    Sit down and rest yourself: appease your wrath,    Lest with a frown ye wound me to the death.    O, that I were included in my grave,    That either now, to save my prince's life,    Must counsel cruelty, or lose my king!    _K. of Scots._ Why, sirrah, is there means to move her mind?    _Ateu._ O, should I not offend my royal liege,--    _K. of Scots._ Tell all, spare naught, so I may gain my love.    _Ateu._ Alas, my soul, why art thou torn in twain,    For fear thou talk a thing that should displease?    _K. of Scots._ Tut, speak whatso thou wilt, I pardon thee.    _Ateu._ How kind a word, how courteous is his grace!    Who would not die to succour such a king?    My liege, this lovely maid of modest mind    Could well incline to love, but that she fears    Fair Dorothea's power: your grace doth know,    Your wedlock is a mighty let to love.    Were Ida sure to be your wedded wife,    That then the twig would bow you might command:    Ladies love presents, pomp, and high estate.    _K. of Scots._ Ah, Ateukin, how should we displace this let?    _Ateu._ Tut, mighty prince,--O, that I might be whist![269]    _K. of Scots._ Why dalliest thou?    _Ateu._ I will not move my prince!    I will prefer his safety 'fore my life.    Hear me, O king! 'tis Dorothea's death    Must do you good.    _K. of Scots._ What, murder of my queen!    Yet, to enjoy my love, what is my queen?    O, but my vow and promise to my queen!    Ay, but my hope to gain a fairer queen:    With how contrarious thoughts am I withdrawn!    Why linger I 'twixt hope and doubtful fear?    If Dorothea die, will Ida love?    _Ateu._ She will, my lord.    _K. of Scots._ Then let her die: devise, advise the means;    All likes me well that lends me hope in love.    _Ateu._ What, will your grace consent? Then let me work.    There's here in court a Frenchman, Jaques call'd    A fit performer of our enterprise,    Whom I by gifts and promise will corrupt    To slay the queen, so that your grace will seal    A warrant for the man, to save his life.    _K. of Scots._ Naught shall he want; write thou, and I will sign:    And, gentle Gnatho, if my Ida yield,    Thou shalt have what thou wilt; I'll give thee straight    A barony, an earldom, for reward.    _Ateu._ Frolic, young king, the lass shall be your own:    I'll make her blithe and wanton by my wit.    [_Exeunt_.CHORUS[270] _Enter_ BOHAN _and_ OBERON.    _Boh._ So, Oberon, now it begins to work in kind.    The ancient lords by leaving him alone,    Disliking of his humours and despite,    Let him run headlong, till his flatterers,    Soliciting his thoughts of lawless lust    With vile persuasions and alluring words,    Make him make way by murder to his will.    Judge, fairy king, hast heard a greater ill?    _Ober._ Nor seen more virtue in a country maid.    I tell thee, Bohan, it doth make me sorry,    To think the deeds the king means to perform.    _Boh._ To change that humour, stand and see the rest:    I trow my son Slipper will show's a jest. _Enter_ SLIPPER _with a companion_, boy _or_ wench, _dancing a hornpipe, and dance out again._    Now after this beguiling of our thoughts,    And changing them from sad to better glee,    Let's to our cell, and sit and see the rest,    For, I believe, this jig will prove no jest. [_Exeunt_.ACT THE THIRDSCENE I.--_Edinburgh._ _Enter_ SLIPPER _one way, and_ SIR BARTRAM _another way.__Sir Bar._ Ho, fellow! stay, and let me speak with thee._Slip._ Fellow! friend, thou dost disbuse me; I am a gentleman._Sir Bar._ A gentleman! how so?_Slip._ Why, I rub horses, sir._Sir Bar._ And what of that?_Slip._ O simple-witted! mark my reason. They that do good service inthe commonweal are gentlemen; but such as rub horses do good servicein the commonweal; ergo, tarbox, master courtier, a horse-keeper is agentleman._Sir Bar._ Here is overmuch wit, in good earnest. But, sirrah, where isthy master?_Slip._ Neither above ground nor under ground, drawing out red intowhite, swallowing that down without chawing that was never made withouttreading._Sir Bar._ Why, where is he, then?_Slip._ Why, in his cellar, drinking a cup of neat and brisk claret,in a bowl of silver. O, sir, the wine runs trillill down his throat,which cost the poor vintner many a stamp before it was made. But I musthence, sir, I have haste._Sir Bar._ Why, whither now, I prithee?_Slip._ Faith, sir, to Sir Silvester, a knight, hard by, upon mymaster's errand, whom I must certify this, that the lease of EastSpring shall be confirmed; and therefore must I bid him provide trash,for my master is no friend without money.    _Sir Bar._ [_aside_]. This is the thing for which I su'd so long,    This is the lease which I, by Gnatho's means,    Sought to possess by patent from the king;    But he, injurious man, who lives by crafts,    And sells king's favours for who will give most,    Hath taken bribes of me, yet covertly    Will sell away the thing pertains to me:    But I have found a present help, I hope,    For to prevent his purpose and deceit.--    Stay, gentle friend._Slip._ A good word; thou hast won me: this word is like a warm caudleto a cold stomach._Sir Bar._ Sirrah, wilt thou, for money and reward,Convey me certain letters, out of hand,From out thy master's pocket?_Slip._ Will I, sir? why, were it to rob my father, hang my mother, orany such like trifles, I am at your commandment, sir. What will yougive me, sir?_Sir Bar._ A hundred pounds._Slip._ I am your man: give me earnest. I am dead at a pocket, sir;why, I am a lifter, master, by my occupation._Sir Bar._ A lifter! what is that?_Slip._ Why, sir, I can lift a pot as well as any man, and pick a purseas soon as any thief in my country._Sir Bar._ Why, fellow, hold; here is earnest, ten pound to assurethee. [_Gives money_]. Go, despatch, and bring it me to yonder tavernthou seest; and assure thyself, thou shalt both have thy skin full ofwine and the rest of thy money._Slip._ I will, sir.--Now room for a gentleman, my masters! who givesme money for a fair new angel,[271] a trim new angel? [_Exeunt._SCENE II.--_The Same._ _Enter_ ANDREW _and_ Purveyor._Pur._ Sirrah, I must needs have your master's horses: the king cannotbe unserved._And._ Sirrah, you must needs go without them, because my master mustbe served._Pur._ Why, I am the king's purveyor, and I tell thee I will have them._And._ I am Ateukin's servant, Signior Andrew, and I say, thou shaltnot have them._Pur._ Here's my ticket; deny it if thou darest._And._ There is the stable; fetch them out if thou darest._Pur._ Sirrah, sirrah, tame your tongue, lest I make you._And._ Sirrah, sirrah, hold your hand, lest I bum[272] you._Pur._ I tell thee, thy master's geldings are good, and therefore fitfor the king._And._ I tell thee, my master's horses have galled backs, and thereforecannot fit the king. Purveyor, purveyor, purvey thee of more wit:darest thou presume to wrong my Lord Ateukin, being the chiefest man incourt?_Pur._ The more unhappy commonweal where flatterers are chief in court._And._ What sayest thou?_Pur._ I say thou art too presumptuous, and the officers shall schoolthee._And._ A fig for them and thee, purveyor! They seek a knot in a ringthat would wrong my master or his servants in this court. _Enter_ JAQUES._Pur._ The world is at a wise pass when nobility is afraid of aflatterer._Jaq._ Sirrah, what be you that _parley contre Monsieur_ my LordAteukin? _en bonne foi_, prate you against Sir _Altesse_, me maka your_tête_ to leap from your shoulders, _per ma foi c'y ferai-je?__And._ O, signior captain, you show yourself a forward and friendlygentleman in my master's behalf: I will cause him to thank you._Jaq. Poltron_, speak me one _parola_ against my _bon gentilhomme_, Ishall _estamp_ your guts, and thump your backa, that you _no point_manage this ten hours._Pur._ Sirrah, come open me the stable, and let me have thehorses;--and, fellow, for all your French brags, I will do my duty._And._ I'll make garters of thy guts, thou villain, if thou enter thisoffice._Jaq. Mort Dieu_, take me that cappa _pour votre labeur_: be gone,villain, in the _mort_. [_Exit.__Pur._ What, will you resist me, then? Well, the council, fellow, shallknow of your insolency._And._ Tell them what thou wilt, and eat that I can best spare from myback-parts, and get you gone with a vengeance. [_Exit_ Purveyor. _Enter_ ATEUKIN._Ateu._ Andrew._And._ Sir?_Ateu._ Where be my writings I put in my pocket last night?_And._ Which, sir? your annotations upon Machiavel?_Ateu._ No, sir; the letters-patents for East Spring._And._ Why, sir, you talk wonders to me, if you ask that question._Ateu._ Yea, sir, and will work wonders too with you, unless you findthem out: villain, search me them out, and bring them me, or thou artbut dead._And._ A terrible word in the latter end of a sessions. Master, wereyou in your right wits yesternight?_Ateu._ Dost thou doubt it?_And._ Ay, and why not, sir? for the greatest clerks are not thewisest, and a fool may dance in a hood, as well as a wise man in a barefrock: besides, such as give themselves to philautia,[273] as you do,master, are so choleric of complexion that that which they burn in fireover night they seek for with fury the next morning. Ah, I take careof your worship! this commonweal should have a great loss of so good amember as you are._Ateu._ Thou flatterest me._And._ Is it flattery in me, sir, to speak you fair? what is it, then,in you to dally with the king?_Ateu._ Are you prating, knave? I will teach you better nurture! Isthis the care you have of my wardrobe, of my accounts, and matters oftrust?_And._ Why, alas, sir, in times past your garments have been so wellinhabited as your tenants would give no place to a moth to mangle them;but since you are grown greater, and your garments more fine and gay,if your garments are not fit for hospitality, blame your pride andcommend my cleanliness: as for your writings, I am not for them, northey for me._Ateu._ Villain, go, fly, find them out: if thou losest them, thoulosest my credit._And._ Alas, sir, can I lose that you never had?_Ateu._ Say you so? then hold, feel you that you never felt. [_Beatshim._ _Re-enter_ JAQUES._Jaq._ O monsieur, _ayez patience_: pardon your _pauvre valet_: me beat your commandment._Ateu._ Signior Jaques, well met; you shall command me.--Sirrah, gocause my writings be proclaimed in the market-place; promise a greatreward to them that find them; look where I supped and everywhere._And._ I will, sir--[_aside_]. Now are two knaves well met, and threewell parted: if thou conceive mine enigma, gentlemen,[274] what shall Ibe, then? faith, a plain harp-shilling.[275] [_Exit._    _Ateu._ Sieur Jaques, this our happy meeting rids    Your friends and me of care and grievous toil;    For I, that look into deserts of men,    And see among the soldiers in this court    A noble forward mind, and judge thereof,    Cannot but seek the means to raise them up    Who merit credit in the commonweal.    To this intent, friend Jaques, I have found    A means to make you great, and well-esteem'd    Both with the king and with the best in court:    For I espy in you a valiant mind,    Which makes me love, admire, and honour you.    To this intent, if so your trust, and faith,    Your secrecy be equal with your force,    I will impart a service to thyself,    Which if thou dost effect, the king, myself,    And what or he, or I with him, can work,    Shall be employ'd in what thou wilt desire._Jaq._ Me sweara by my ten bones, my signior, to be loyal to yourlordship's intents, affairs: yea, my _monseigneur, que non ferai-jepour_ your pleasure? By my sworda, me be no _babillard_.[276]    _Ateu._ Then hoping on thy truth, I prithee see    How kind Ateukin is to forward thee.    Hold [_giving money_], take this earnest-penny of my love,    And mark my words: the king, by me, requires    No slender service, Jaques, at thy hands.--    Thou must by privy practice make away    The queen, fair Dorothea, as she sleeps,    Or how thou wilt, so she be done to death:    Thou shalt not want promotion here in court._Jaq._ Stabba the woman! _par ma foi, monseigneur_, me thrusta myweapon into her belly, so me may be guard _par le roi_. Me do yourservice: but me no be hanged _pour_ my labour?    _Ateu._ Thou shalt have warrant, Jaques, from the king:    None shall outface, gainsay, and wrong my friend.    Do not I love thee, Jaques? fear not, then:    I tell thee, whoso toucheth thee in aught    Shall injure me: I love, I tender thee:    Thou art a subject fit to serve his grace.    Jaques, I had a written warrant once,    But that, by great misfortune, late is lost.    Come, wend we to Saint Andrews, where his grace    Is now in progress, where he shall assure    Thy safety, and confirm thee to the act._Jaq._ We will attend your nobleness. [_Exeunt._SCENE III.--_The Palace of the_ KING OF SCOTS. _Enter_ QUEEN DOROTHEA, SIR BARTRAM, NANO, ROSS, Ladies, _and_ Attendants.    _Q. Dor._ Thy credit, Bartram, in the Scottish court,    Thy reverend years, the strictness of thy vows,    All these are means sufficient to persuade;    But love, the faithful link of loyal hearts,    That hath possession of my constant mind,    Exiles all dread, subdueth vain suspect.    Methinks no craft should harbour in that breast    Where majesty and virtue are install'd:    Methinks my beauty should not cause my death.    _Sir Bar._ How gladly, sovereign princess, would I err,    And bide my shame to save your royal life!    'Tis princely in yourself to think the best,    To hope his grace is guiltless of this crime:    But if in due prevention you default,    How blind are you that were forewarn'd before!    _Q. Dor._ Suspicion without cause deserveth blame.    _Sir Bar._ Who see, and shun not, harms, deserve the same.    Behold the tenor of this traitorous plot.    [_Gives warrant._    _Q. Dor._ What should I read? Perhaps he wrote it not.    _Sir Bar._ Here is his warrant, under seal and sign,    To Jaques, born in France, to murder you.    _Q. Dor._ Ah, careless king, would God this were not thine!    What though I read? ah, should I think it true?    _Ross._ The hand and seal confirm the deed is his.    _Q. Dor._ What know I though if now he thinketh this?    _Nano._ Madam, Lucretius saith that to repent    Is childish, wisdom to prevent.    _Q. Dor._ What tho?    _Nano._ Then cease your tears, that have dismay'd you,    And cross the foe before he have betray'd you.    _Sir Bar._ What need these long suggestions in this cause,    When every circumstance confirmeth truth?    First, let the hidden mercy from above    Confirm your grace, since by a wondrous means    The practice of your dangers came to light:    Next, let the tokens of approvèd truth    Govern and stay your thoughts, too much seduc'd,    And mark the sooth, and listen the intent.    Your highness knows, and these my noble lords    Can witness this, that whilst your husband's sire    In happy peace possess'd the Scottish crown,    I was his sworn attendant here in court;    In dangerous fight I never fail'd my lord;    And since his death, and this your husband's reign,    No labour, duty, have I left undone,    To testify my zeal unto the crown.    But now my limbs are weak, mine eyes are dim,    Mine age unwieldly and unmeet for toil,    I came to court, in hope, for service past,    To gain some lease to keep me, being old.    There found I all was upsy-turvy turn'd,    My friends displac'd, the nobles loth to crave:    Then sought I to the minion of the king,    Ateukin, who, allurèd by a bribe,    Assur'd me of the lease for which I sought.    But see the craft! when he had got the grant,    He wrought to sell it to Sir Silvester,    In hope of greater earnings from his hands.    In brief, I learn'd his craft, and wrought the means,    By one his needy servants for reward,    To steal from out his pocket all the briefs;    Which he perform'd, and with reward resign'd.    Them when I read,--now mark the power of God,--    I found this warrant seal'd among the rest,    To kill your grace, whom God long keep alive!    Thus, in effect, by wonder are you sav'd:    Trifle not, then, but seek a speedy flight;    God will conduct your steps, and shield the right.    _Q. Dor._ What should I do? ah, poor unhappy queen,    Born to endure what fortune can contain!    Alas, the deed is too apparent now!    But, O mine eyes, were you as bent to hide    As my poor heart is forward to forgive,    Ah cruel king, my love would thee acquit!    O, what avails to be allied and match'd    With high estates, that marry but in show?    Were I baser born, my mean estate    Could warrant me from this impendent harm:    But to be great and happy, these are twain.    Ah, Ross, what shall I do? how shall I work?    _Ross._ With speedy letters to your father send,    Who will revenge you and defend your right.    _Q.  Dor._ As if they kill not me, who with him fight!    As if his breast be touch'd, I am not wounded!    As if he wail'd, my joys were not confounded!    We are one heart, though rent by hate in twain;    One soul, one essence doth our weal contain:    What, then, can conquer him, that kills not me?    _Ross._ If this advice displease, then, madam, flee.    _Q. Dor._ Where may I wend or travel without fear?    _Ross._ Where not, in changing this attire you wear?    _Q. Dor._ What, shall I clad me like a country maid?    _Nano._ The policy is base, I am afraid.    _Q. Dor._ Why, Nano?    _Nano._ Ask you why? What, may a queen    March forth in homely weed, and be not seen?    The rose, although in thorny shrubs she spread,    Is still the rose, her beauties wax not dead;    And noble minds, although the coat be bare,    Are by their semblance known, how great they are.    _Sir Bar._ The dwarf saith true.    _Q. Dor._ What garments lik'st thou, than?    _Nano._ Such as may make you seem a proper man.    _Q. Dor._ He makes me blush and smile, though I am sad.    _Nano._ The meanest coat for safety is not bad.    _Q. Dor._ What, shall I jet[277] in breeches, like a squire?    Alas, poor dwarf, thy mistress is unmeet.    _Nano._ Tut, go me thus, your cloak before your face,    Your sword uprear'd with quaint and comely grace:    If any come and question what you be,    Say you "A man," and call for witness me.    _Q. Dor._ What, should I wear a sword? to what intent?    _Nano._ Madam, for show; it is an ornament:    If any wrong you, draw: a shining blade    Withdraws a coward thief that would invade.    _Q. Dor._ But, if I strike, and he should strike again,    What should I do? I fear I should be slain.    _Nano._ No, take it single on your dagger so:    I'll teach you, madam, how to ward a blow.    _Q. Dor._ How little shapes much substance may include!--    Sir Bartram, Ross, ye ladies, and my friends,    Since presence yields me death, and absence life,    Hence will I fly, disguisèd like a squire,    As one that seeks to live in Irish wars:    You, gentle Ross, shall furnish my depart.    _Ross._ Yea, prince, and die with you with all my heart!    Vouchsafe me, then, in all extremest states    To wait on you and serve you with my best.    _Q. Dor._ To me pertains the woe: live then in rest.    Friends, fare you well: keep secret my depart:    Nano alone shall my attendant be.    _Nano._ Then, madam, are you mann'd, I warrant ye!    Give me a sword, and, if there grow debate,    I'll come behind, and break your enemy's pate.    _Ross._ How sore we grieve to part so soon away!    _Q.

Que dites vous_, Monsieur Andrew?_And._ I say, Jaques, thou must keep this path, and hie thee; for thequeen, as I am certified, is departed with her dwarf, apparelled likea squire. Overtake her, Frenchman, stab her: I'll promise thee, thisdoublet shall be happy._Jaq. Pourquoi?__And._ It shall serve a jolly gentleman, Sir Dominus MonseigneurHangman._Jaq. C'est tout un_; me will rama _pour la monnoie_. [_Exit.__And._ Go, and the rot consume thee!--O, what a trim world is this!My master lives by cozening the king, I by flattering him; Slipper,my fellow, by stealing, and I by lying: is not this a wily accord,gentlemen?[280] This last night, our jolly horsekeeper, being wellsteeped in liquor, confessed to me the stealing of my master'swritings, and his great reward. Now dare I not bewray him, lest hediscover my knavery; but this have I wrought: I understand he will passthis way, to provide him necessaries; but, if I and my fellows failnot, we will teach him such a lesson as shall cost him a chief place onPennyless Bench[281] for his labour. But yond he comes. [_Stands aside._ _Enter_ SLIPPER, _with a_ Tailor, _a_ Shoemaker, _and a_ Cutler._Slip._ Tailor._Tai._ Sir?_Slip._ Let my doublet be white northern, five groats the yard: I tellthee, I will be brave._Tai._ It shall, sir._Slip._ Now, sir, cut it me like the battlements of a custard, fullof round holes; edge me the sleeves with Coventry blue, and let thelinings be of tenpenny lockram._Tai._ Very good, sir._Slip._ Make it the amorous cut, a flap before._Tai._ And why so? that fashion is stale._Slip._ O, friend, thou art a simple fellow. I tell thee, a flap is agreat friend to a storrie; it stands him instead of clean napery; and,if a man's shirt be torn, it is a present penthouse to defend him froma clean huswife's scoff._Tai._ You say sooth, sir._Slip._ [_giving money_]. Hold, take thy money; there is sevenshillings for the doublet, and eight for the breeches: seven and eight;by'rlady, thirty-six is a fair deal of money._Tai._ Farewell, sir._Slip._ Nay, but stay, tailor._Tai._ Why, sir?_Slip._ Forget not this special make: let my back-parts be well lined,for there come many winter-storms from a windy belly, I tell thee.[_Exit_ Tailor]. Shoemaker._Shoe._ Gentleman, what shoe will it please you to have?_Slip._ A fine, neat calves'-leather, my friend._Shoe._ O, sir, that is too thin, it will not last you._Slip._ I tell thee, it is my near kinsman, for I am Slipper, whichhath his best grace in summer to be suited in calves'[282] skins.Goodwife Calf was my grandmother, and Goodman Netherleather mine uncle;but my mother, good woman, alas, she was a Spaniard, and being welltanned and dressed by a good fellow, an Englishman, is grown to somewealth: as, when I have but my upper-parts clad in her husband's costlySpanish leather, I may be bold to kiss the fairest lady's foot in thiscountry._Shoe._ You are of high birth, sir: but have you all your mother'smarks on you?_Slip._ Why, knave?_Shoe._ Because, if thou come of the blood of the Slippers, you shouldhave a shoemaker's awl thrust through your ear._Slip._ [_giving money_]. Take your earnest, friend, and be packing,and meddle not with my progenitors. [_Exit_ Shoemaker]. Cutler._Cut._ Here, sir._Slip._ I must have a reaper and digger.[283]_Cut._ A rapier and dagger, you mean, sir?_Slip._ Thou sayest true; but it must have a very fair edge._Cut._ Why so, sir?_Slip._ Because it may cut by himself, for truly, my friend, I am a manof peace, and wear weapons but for fashion._Cut._ Well, sir, give me earnest, I will fit you._Slip._ [_giving money_]. Hold, take it: I betrust thee, friend; let mebe well armed._Cut._ You shall. [_Exit.__Slip._ Now what remains? there's twenty crowns for house, three crownsfor household-stuff, sixpence to buy a constable's staff; nay, I willbe the chief of my parish. There wants nothing but a wench, a cat, adog, a wife, and a servant, to make an whole family. Shall I marry withAlice, Goodman Grimshawe's daughter? she is fair, but indeed her tongueis like clocks on Shrove Tuesday, always out of temper. Shall I wedSisley of the Whighton? O, no! she is like a frog in a parsley bed; asskittish as an eel: if I seek to hamper her, she will horn me. But awench must be had, Master Slipper; yea, and shall be, dear friend._And._ [_aside_]. I now will drive him from his contemplations.--O, mymates, come forward: the lamb is unpent, the fox shall prevail. _Enter three_ Antics, _who dance round, and take_ Slipper _with them.__Slip._ I will, my friend, and I thank you heartily: pray, keep yourcourtesy: I am yours in the way of an hornpipe.--[_Aside_]. They arestrangers; I see they understand not my language: wee, wee.--[284][_Whilst they are dancing_, ANDREW _takes away_ SLIPPER'S _money, andthe other_ Antics _depart._Nay, but, my friends, one hornpipe further! a refluence back, and twodoubles forward! What, not one cross-point against Sundays? What, ho,sirrah, you gone? you with the nose like an eagle, an you be a rightGreek, one turn more.--Thieves, thieves! I am robbed! thieves! Is thisthe knavery of fiddlers? Well, I will then bind the whole credit oftheir occupation on a bag-piper, and he for my money. But I will after,and teach them to caper in a halter, that have cozened me of my money.[_Exit._SCENE IV.--_The Forest near Edinburgh._ _Enter_ QUEEN DOROTHEA _in man's apparel, and_ NANO.    _Q. Dor._ Ah, Nano, I am weary of these weeds,    Weary to wield this weapon that I bear,    Weary of love from whom my woe proceeds,    Weary of toil, since I have lost my dear.    O weary life, where wanteth no distress,    But every thought is paid with heaviness!    _Nano._ Too much of weary, madam: if you please,    Sit down, let weary die, and take your ease.    _Q. Dor._ How look I, Nano? like a man or no?    _Nano._ If not a man, yet like a manly shrow.[285]    _Q. Dor._ If any come and meet us on the way,    What should we do, if they enforce us stay?    _Nano._ Set cap a-huff, and challenge him the field:    Suppose the worst, the weak may fight to yield.    _Q. Dor._ The battle, Nano, in this troubled mind    Is far more fierce than ever we may find.    The body's wounds by medicines may be eas'd,    But griefs of mind, by salves are no appeas'd.    _Nano._ Say, madam, will you hear your Nano sing?    _Q. Dor._ Of woe, good boy, but of no other thing.    _Nano._ What if I sing of fancy?[286] will it please?    _Q. Dor._ To such as hope success such notes breed ease.    _Nano._ What if I sing, like Damon, to my sheep?    _Q. Dor._ Like Phillis, I will sit me down to weep.    _Nano._ Nay, since my songs afford such pleasure small,    I'll sit me down, and sing you none at all.    _Q. Dor._ O, be not angry, Nano!    _Nano._ Nay, you loathe    To think on that which doth content us both.    _Q. Dor._ And how?    _Nano._ You scorn disport when you are weary,    And loathe my mirth, who live to make you merry.    _Q. Dor._ Danger and fear withdraw me from delight.    _Nano._ 'Tis virtue to contemn false fortune's spite.    _Q. Dor._ What should I do to please thee, friendly squire?    _Nano._ A smile a-day is all I will require;    And, if you pay me well the smiles you owe me,    I'll kill this cursèd care, or else beshrow me.    _Q. Dor._ We are descried; O, Nano, we are dead!     _Enter_ JAQUES, _his sword drawn._    _Nano._ Tut, yet you walk, you are not dead indeed.    Draw me your sword, if he your way withstand,    And I will seek for rescue out of hand.    _Q. Dor._ Run, Nano, run, prevent thy princess' death._Nano._ Fear not, I'll run all danger out of breath.[_Exit.__Jaq._ Ah, you _calletta_! you _strumpetta! Maitressa Doretie, êtesvous surprise?_ Come, say your paternoster, _car vous êtes morte, parma foi_.    _Q. Dor._ Callet! me strumpet! Caitiff as thou art!    But even a princess born, who scorns thy threats:    Shall never Frenchman say an England maid    Of threats of foreign force will be afraid._Jaq._ You no _dire votres prières? morbleu, mechante femme_, guardayour breasta there: me make you die on my Morglay.[287]    _Q. Dor._ God shield me, helpless princess and a wife,    And save my soul, although I lose my life!    [_They fight, and she is sore wounded._    Ah, I am slain! some piteous power repay    This murderer's cursèd deed, that doth me slay!_Jaq. Elle est tout morte._ Me will run _pour_ a wager, for fear mebe _surpris_ and _pendu_ for my labour. _Bien, je m'en allerai au roilui dire mes affaires.

Oui, Monsieur, elle_ is _blessée par la tête_ over _les épaules_:I warrant, she no trouble you.    _Ateu._ O, then, my liege, how happy art thou grown,    How favour'd of the heavens, and blest by love!    Methinks I see fair Ida in thine arms,    Craving remission for her late contempt;    Methinks I see her blushing steal a kiss,    Uniting both your souls by such a sweet;    And you, my king, suck nectar from her lips.    Why, then, delays your grace to gain the rest    You long desir'd? why lose we forward time?    Write, make me spokesman now, vow marriage:    If she deny you favour, let me die._And._ Mighty and magnificent potentate, give credence to minehonourable good lord, for I heard the midwife swear at his nativitythat the fairies gave him the property of the Thracian stone; forwho toucheth it is exempted from grief, and he that heareth mymaster's counsel is already possessed of happiness; nay, which is moremiraculous, as the nobleman in his infancy lay in his cradle, a swarmof bees laid honey on his lips in token of his eloquence, for _melledulcior fluit oratio_._Ateu._ Your grace must bear with imperfections:This is exceeding love that makes him speak.    _K. of Scots._ Ateukin, I am ravish'd in conceit,    And yet depress'd again with earnest thoughts.    Methinks, this murder soundeth in mine ear    A threatening noise of dire and sharp revenge:    I am incens'd with grief, yet fain would joy.    What may I do to end me of these doubts?    _Ateu._ Why, prince, it is no murder in a king    To end another's life to save his own:    For you are not as common people be,    Who die and perish with a few men's tears;    But if you fail, the state doth whole default,    The realm is rent in twain in such a loss.    And Aristotle holdeth this for true,    Of evils needs we must choose the least:    Then better were it, that a woman died    Than all the help of Scotland should be blent.    'Tis policy, my liege, in every state,    To cut off members that disturb the head:    And by corruption generation grows,    And contraries maintain the world and state.    _K. of Scots._ Enough, I am confirm'd. Ateukin, come,    Rid me of love, and rid me of my grief;    Drive thou the tyrant from this tainted breast,    Then may I triumph in the height of joy.    Go to mine Ida, tell her that I vow    To raise her head, and make her honours great:    Go to mine Ida, tell her that her hairs    Shall be embellishèd with orient pearls,    And crowns of sapphires compassing her brows,    Shall war with those sweet beauties of her eyes:    Go to mine Ida, tell her that my soul    Shall keep her semblance closèd in my breast;    And I, in touching of her milk-white mould,    Will think me deified in such a grace.    I like no stay: go write, and I will sign:    Reward me Jaques; give him store of crowns.    And, Sirrah Andrew, scout thou here in court,    And bring me tidings, if thou canst perceive    The least intent of muttering in my train;    For either those that wrong thy lord or thee    Shall suffer death.    _Ateu._ How much, O mighty king,    Is thy Ateukin bound to honour thee!--    Bow thee, Andrew, bend thine sturdy knees;    Seest thou not here thine only God on earth?    [_Exit the_ KING.    _Jaq. Mais où est mon argent, seigneur?_    _Ateu._ Come, follow me. His grace, I see, is mad,[288]    That thus on sudden he hath left us here.--    Come, Jaques: we will have our packet soon despatch'd,    And you shall be my mate upon the way.    _Jaq. Comme vous plaira, monsieur._    [_Exeunt_ ATEUKIN _and_ JAQUES.    _And._ Was never such a world, I think, before,    When sinners seem to dance within a net;    The flatterer and the murderer, they grow big;    By hook or crook promotion now is sought.    In such a world, where men are so misled,    What should I do, but, as the proverb saith,    Run with the hare, and hunt with the hound?    To have two means beseems a witty man.    Now here in court I may aspire and climb    By subtlety, for my master's death:    And, if that fail, well fare another drift;    I will, in secret, certain letters send    Unto the English king, and let him know    The order of his daughter's overthrow,    That, if my master crack his credit here,    As I am sure long flattery cannot hold,    I may have means within the English court    To 'scape the scourge that waits on bad advice.    [_Exit._CHORUS _Enter_ BOHAN _and_ OBERON.    _Ober._ Believe me, bonny Scot, these strange events    Are passing pleasing; may they end as well.    _Boh._ Else say that Bohan hath a barren skull,    If better motions yet than any past    Do not, more glee to make, the fairy greet.    But my small son made pretty handsome shift    To save the queen his mistress, by his speed.    _Ober._ Yea, and yon laddie, for his sport he made,    Shall see, when least he hopes, I'll stand his friend,    Or else he capers in a halter's end.    _Boh._ What, hang my son! I trow not, Oberon:    I'll rather die than see him woebegone.     _Enter a round, or some dance, at pleasure._    _Ober._ Bohan, be pleas'd, for, do they what they will,    Here is my hand, I'll save thy son from ill.    [_Exeunt._ACT THE FIFTHSCENE I._--Castle of_ SIR CUTHBERT ANDERSON. _Enter_ QUEEN DOROTHEA _in man's apparel and in a nightgown,_ LADY ANDERSON, _and_ NANO; _and_ SIR CUTHBERT ANDERSON _behind_._Lady And._ My gentle friend, beware, in taking air,Your walks grow not offensive to your wounds._Q. Dor._ Madam, I thank you of your courteous care:My wounds are well-nigh clos'd, though sore they are._Lady And._ Methinks these closèd wounds should breed more grief,Since open wounds have cure, and find relief._Q. Dor._ Madam, if undiscover'd wounds you mean,They are not cur'd, because they are not seen._Lady And._ I mean the wounds which do the heart subdue._Nano._ O, that is love: Madam, speak I not true?[SIR CUTHBERT ANDERSON _overhears.__Lady And._ Say it were true, what salve for such a sore?_Nano._ Be wise, and shut such neighbours out of door._Lady And._ How if I cannot drive him from my breast?_Nano._ Then chain him well, and let him do his best._Sir Cuth._ [_aside_]. In ripping up their wounds, I see their wit;But if these wounds be cur'd, I sorrow it.    _Q. Dor._ Why are you so intentive to behold    My pale and woful looks, by care controll'd?    _Lady And._ Because in them a ready way is found    To cure my care and heal my hidden wound.    _Nano._ Good master, shut your eyes, keep that conceit;    Surgeons give coin to get a good receipt.    _Q. Dor._ Peace, wanton son; this lady did amend    My wounds; mine eyes her hidden griefs shall end.    _Nano._ Look not too much, it is a weighty case    Whereas a man puts on a maiden's face;    For many times, if ladies 'ware them not,    A nine months' wound, with little work is got._Sir Cuth._ [_aside_]. I'll break off their dispute, lest love proceedFrom covert smiles, to perfect love indeed.[_Comes forward.__Nano._ The cat's abroad, stir not, the mice be still._Lady And._ Tut, we can fly such cats, when so we will.    _Sir Cuth._ How fares my guest? take cheer, naught shall default,    That either doth concern your health or joy:    Use me; my house, and what is mine is yours.    _Q. Dor._ Thanks, gentle knight; and, if all hopes be true,    I hope ere long to do as much for you.    _Sir Cuth._ Your virtue doth acquit me of that doubt:    But, courteous sir, since troubles call me hence,    I must to Edinburgh unto the king,    There to take charge, and wait him in his wars.--    Meanwhile, good madam, take this squire in charge,    And use him so as if it were myself.    _Lady And._ Sir Cuthbert, doubt not of my diligence:    Meanwhile, till your return, God send you health.    _Q. Dor._ God bless his grace, and, if his cause be just,    Prosper his wars; if not, he'll mend, I trust.    Good sir, what moves the king to fall to arms?    _Sir Cuth._ The King of England forageth his land,    And hath besieg'd Dunbar with mighty force.    What other news are common in the court.    Read you these letters, madam;    [_giving letters to_ LADY ANDERSON]                                    tell the squire    The whole affairs of state, for I must hence._Q. Dor._ God prosper you, and bring you back from thence![_Exit_ SIR CUTHBERT ANDERSON.Madam, what news?_Lady And._ They say the queen is slain._Q. Dor._ Tut, such reports more false than truth contain._Lady And._ But these reports have made his nobles leave him._Q. Dor._ Ah, careless men, and would they so deceive him?    _Lady And._ The land is spoil'd, the commons fear the cross;    All cry against the king, their cause of loss:    The English king subdues and conquers all.    _Q. Dor._ Alas, this war grows great on causes small!    _Lady And._ Our court is desolate, our prince alone,    Still dreading death.    _Q. Dor._ Woe's me, for him I mourn!    Help, now help, a sudden qualm    Assails my heart!    _Nano._ Good madam, stand his friend:    Give us some liquor to refresh his heart.    _Lady And._ Daw thou him up,[289] and I will fetch thee forth    Potions of comfort, to repress his pain. [_Exit._    _Nano._ Fie, princess, faint on every fond report!    How well-nigh had you open'd your estate!    Cover these sorrows with the veil of joy,    And hope the best; for why this war will cause    A great repentance in your husband's mind.    _Q. Dor._ Ah, Nano, trees live not without their sap,    And Clytie cannot blush but on the sun;    The thirsty earth is broke with many a gap,    And lands are lean where rivers do not run:    Where soul is reft from that it loveth best,    How can it thrive or boast of quiet rest?    Thou know'st the prince's loss must be my death,    His grief, my grief; his mischief must be mine.    O, if thou love me, Nano, hie to court!    Tell Ross, tell Bartram, that I am alive;    Conceal thou yet the place of my abode:    Will them, even as they love their queen,    As they are chary of my soul and joy,    To guard the king, to serve him as my lord.    Haste thee, good Nano, for my husband's care    Consumeth me, and wounds me to the heart.    _Nano._ Madam, I go, yet loth to leave you here.    _Q.

Dor._ My grief is past, I feel no further sting.    _Lady And._ Where is your dwarf? why hath he left you, sir?    _Q. Dor._ For some affairs: he is not travell'd far.    _Lady And._ If so you please, come in and take your rest.    _Q.

I know the heavens    Are just and will revenge; I know my sins    Exceed compare. Should I proceed in this,    This Eustace must amain be made away.    O, were I dead, how happy should I be!_Jaq.

Dunbar is too-too small    To give an entrance to the English king:    I, eagle-like, disdain these little fowls,    And look on none but those that dare resist.    Enter your town, as those that live by me:    For others that resist, kill, forage, spoil.    Mine English soldiers, as you love your king,    Revenge his daughter's death, and do me right.    [_Exeunt_.SCENE IV.--_Near the Scottish Camp._ _Enter a_ Lawyer, _a_ Merchant, _and a_ Divine.    _Law._ My friends, what think you of this present state?    Were ever seen such changes in a time?    The manners and the fashions of this age    Are, like the ermine-skin, so full of spots,    As sooner may the Moor be washèd white    Than these corruptions banish'd from this realm.    _Merch._ What sees Mas Lawyer in this state amiss?    _Law._ A wresting power that makes a nose of wax    Of grounded law, a damn'd and subtle drift    In all estates to climb by others' loss;    An eager thirst of wealth, forgetting truth.    Might I ascend unto the highest states,    And by descent discover every crime,    My friends, I should lament, and you would grieve    To see the hapless ruins of this realm.    _Div._ O lawyer, thou hast curious eyes to pry    Into the secret maims of their estate;    But if thy veil of error were unmask'd,    Thyself should see your sect do maim her most.    Are you not those that should maintain the peace,    Yet only are the patrons of our strife?    If your profession have his ground and spring    First from the laws of God, then country's right,    Not any ways inverting nature's power,    Why thrive you by contentions? why devise you    Clauses, and subtle reasons to except?    Our state was first, before you grew so great,    A lantern to the world for unity:    Now they that are befriended and are rich    Oppress the poor: come Homer without coin,    He is not heard. What shall we term this drift?    To say the poor man's cause is good and just,    And yet the rich man gains the best in law?    It is your guise (the more the world laments)    To coin provisos to beguile your laws;    To make a gay pretext of due proceeding,    When you delay your common-pleas for years.    Mark what these dealings lately here have wrought:    The crafty men have purchas'd great men's lands;    They powl,[292] they pinch, their tenants are undone;    If these complain, by you they are undone;    You fleece them of their coin, their children beg,    And many want, because you may be rich:    This scar is mighty, Master Lawyer.    Now war hath gotten head within this land,    Mark but the guise. The poor man that is wrong'd    Is ready to rebel; he spoils, he pills;    We need no foes to forage that we have:    The law, say they, in peace consumèd us,    And now in war we will consume the law.    Look to this mischief, lawyers: conscience knows    You live amiss; amend it, lest you end!    _Law._ Good Lord, that these divines should see so far    In others' faults, without amending theirs!    Sir, sir, the general defaults in state    (If you would read before you did correct)    Are, by a hidden working from above,    By their successive changes still remov'd.    Were not the law by contraries maintain'd,    How could the truth from falsehood be discern'd?    Did we not taste the bitterness of war,    How could we know the sweet effects of peace?    Did we not feel the nipping winter-frosts,    How should we know the sweetness of the spring?    Should all things still remain in one estate,    Should not in greatest arts some scars be found?    Were all upright, nor chang'd, what world were this?    A chaos, made of quiet, yet no world,    Because the parts thereof did still accord:    This matter craves a variance, not a speech.    But, Sir Divine, to you: look on your maims,    Divisions, sects, your simonies, and bribes,    Your cloaking with the great for fear to fall,--    You shall perceive you are the cause of all.    Did each man know there was a storm at hand,    Who would not clothe him well, to shun the wet?    Did prince and peer, the lawyer and the least,    Know what were sin, without a partial gloss,    We'd need no long discovery then of crimes,    For each would mend, advis'd by holy men.    Thus [I] but slightly shadow out your sins;    But, if they were depainted out of life,    Alas, we both had wounds enough to heal!    _Merch._ None of you both, I see, but are in fault;    Thus simple men, as I, do swallow flies.    This grave divine can tell us what to do;    But we may say, "Physician, mend thyself."    This lawyer hath a pregnant wit to talk;    But all are words, I see no deeds of worth.    _Law._ Good merchant, lay your fingers on your mouth;    Be not a blab, for fear you bite yourself.    What should I term your state, but even the way    To every ruin in this commonweal?    You bring us in the means of all excess,    You rate it and retail it as you please;    You swear, forswear, and all to compass wealth;    Your money is your god, your hoard your heaven;    You are the groundwork of contention.    First, heedless youth by you is over-reach'd;    We are corrupted by your many crowns:    The gentlemen, whose titles you have bought,    Lose all their fathers' toil within a day,    Whilst Hob your son, and Sib your nutbrown child,    Are gentlefolks, and gentles are beguil'd.    This makes so many noble minds to stray,    And take sinister courses in the state.     _Enter a_ Scout.    _Scout._ My friends, be gone, an if you love your lives!    The King of England marcheth here at hand:    Enter the camp, for fear you be surpris'd.    _Div._ Thanks, gentle scout,--God mend that is amiss,    And place true zeal whereas corruption is!

Dor._ What news in court, Nano? let us know it.    _Nano._ If so you please, my lord, I straight will show it:    The English king hath all the borders spoil'd,    Hath taken Morton prisoner, and hath slain    Seven thousand Scottish lads not far from Tweed.    _Q. Dor._ A woful murder and a bloody deed!    _Nano._ The king, our liege, hath sought by many means    For to appease his enemy by prayers:    Naught will prevail unless he can restore    Fair Dorothea, long supposèd dead:    To this intent he hath proclaimèd late,    That whosoe'er return the queen to court    Shall have a thousand marks for his reward.    _Lady And._ He loves her, then, I see, although enforc'd,    That would bestow such gifts for to regain her.    Why sit you sad, good sir? be not dismay'd.    _Nano._ I'll lay my life, this man would be a maid.    _Q. Dor._ [_aside to Nano_]. Fain would I show myself, and change my tire.    _Lady And._ Whereon divine you, sir?    _Nano._ Upon desire.    Madam, mark but my skill. I'll lay my life,    My master here, will prove a married wife.    _Q. Dor._ [_aside to Nano_]. Wilt thou bewray me, Nano?    _Nano._ [_aside to Dor._]. Madam, no:    You are a man, and like a man you go:    But I, that am in speculation seen,[293]    Know you would change your state to be a queen.    _Q. Dor._ [_aside to Nano_].    Thou art not, dwarf, to learn thy mistress' mind:    Fain would I with thyself disclose my kind,    But yet I blush.    _Nano._ [_aside to Dor._]. What? blush you, madam, than,[294]    To be yourself, who are a feignèd man?[295]    _Lady And._ Deceitful beauty, hast thou scorn'd me so?    _Nano._ Nay, muse not, madam, for he tells you true.    _Lady And._ Beauty bred love, and love hath bred my shame.    _Nano._ And women's faces work more wrongs than these:    Take comfort, madam, to cure your disease.    And yet he loves a man as well as you,    Only this difference, he cannot fancy two.    _Lady And._ Blush, grieve, and die in thine insatiate lust.    _Q. Dor._ Nay, live, and joy that thou hast won a friend,    That loves thee as his life by good desert.    _Lady And._ I joy, my lord, more than my tongue can tell:    Though not as I desir'd, I love you well.    But modesty, that never blush'd before,    Discover my false heart: I say no more.    Let me alone.    _Q. Dor._ Good Nano, stay awhile.    Were I not sad, how kindly could I smile,    To see how fain I am to leave this weed!    And yet I faint to show myself indeed:    But danger hates delay; I will be bold.--    Fair lady, I am not [as you] suppose,    A man, but even that queen, more hapless I,    Whom Scottish king appointed hath to die;    I am the hapless princess, for whose right,    These kings in bloody wars revenge despite;    I am that Dorothea whom they seek,    Yours bounden for your kindness and relief;    And, since you are the means that save my life,    Yourself and I will to the camp repair,    Whereas your husband shall enjoy reward,    And bring me to his highness once again.    _Lady And._ Pardon, most gracious princess, if you please,    My rude discourse and homely entertain;    And, if my words may savour any worth,    Vouchsafe my counsel in this weighty cause:    Since that our liege hath so unkindly dealt,    Give him no trust, return unto your sire;    There may you safely live in spite of him.    _Q. Dor._ Ah lady, so would worldly counsel work;    But constancy, obedience, and my love,    In that my husband is my lord and chief,    These call me to compassion of his state:    Dissuade me not, for virtue will not change.    _Lady And._ What wondrous constancy is this I hear!    If English dames their husbands love so dear,    I fear me in the world they have no peer.    _Nano._ Come, princess, wend, and let us change your weed:    I long to see you now a queen indeed.

A tender lion's whelp,    This other day, came straggling in the woods,    Attended by a young and tender hind,    In courage haught, yet 'tirèd like a lamb.    The prince of beasts had left this young in keep,    To foster up as love-mate and compeer,    Unto the lion's mate, a neighbour-friend:    This stately guide, seducèd by the fox,    Sent forth an eager wolf, bred up in France,    That gripp'd the tender whelp and wounded it.    By chance, as I was hunting in the woods,    I heard the moan the hind made for the whelp:    I took them both, and brought them to my house.    With chary care I have recur'd the one;    And since I know the lions are at strife    About the loss and damage of the young,    I bring her home; make claim to her who list.    [_Discovers_ QUEEN DOROTHEA.    _Q. Dor._ I am the whelp, bred by this lion up,    This royal English king, my happy sire:    Poor Nano is the hind that tended me.    My father, Scottish king, gave me to thee,    A hapless wife: thou, quite misled by youth,    Hast sought sinister loves and foreign joys.    The fox Ateukin, cursèd parasite,    Incens'd your grace to send the wolf abroad,    The French-born Jaques, for to end my days:    He, traitorous man, pursu'd me in the woods,    And left me wounded; where this noble knight    Both rescu'd me and mine, and sav'd my life.    Now keep thy promise: Dorothea lives;    Give Anderson his due and just reward:    And since, you kings, your wars began by me,    Since I am safe, return, surcease your fight.    _K. of Scots._ Durst I presume to look upon those eyes    Which I have tirèd with a world of woes?    Or did I think submission were enough,    Or sighs might make an entrance to thy soul,    You heavens, you know how willing I would weep;    You heavens can tell how glad I would submit;    You heavens can say how firmly I would sigh.    _Q. Dor._ Shame me not, prince, companion in thy bed:    Youth hath misled,--tut, but a little fault:    'Tis kingly to amend what is amiss.    Might I with twice as many pains as these    Unite our hearts, then should my wedded lord    See how incessant labours I would take.--    My gracious father, govern your affects:    Give me that hand, that oft hath blest this head,    And clasp thine arms, that have embrac'd this [neck],    About the shoulders of my wedded spouse.    Ah, mighty prince, this king and I am one!    Spoil thou his subjects, thou despoilest me;    Touch thou his breast, thou dost attaint this heart:    O, be my father, then, in loving him!    _K. of Eng._ Thou provident kind mother of increase,    Thou must prevail; ah, Nature, thou must rule!    Hold, daughter, join my hand and his in one;    I will embrace him for to favour thee:    I call him friend, and take him for my son.    _Q. Dor._ Ah, royal husband, see what God hath wrought!    Thy foe is now thy friend.--Good men-at-arms,    Do you the like.--These nations if they join,    What monarch, with his liege-men, in this world,    Dare but encounter you in open field?    _K. of Scots._ All wisdom, join'd with godly piety!--    Thou English king, pardon my former youth;    And pardon, courteous queen, my great misdeed;    And, for assurance of mine after-life,    I take religious vows before my God,    To honour thee for father, her for wife.    _Sir Cuth._ But yet my boons, good princes, are not pass'd.    First, English king, I humbly do request,    That by your means our princess may unite    Her love unto mine aldertruest love,[297]    Now you will love, maintain, and help them both.    _K. of Eng._ Good Anderson, I grant thee thy request.    _Sir Cuth._ But you, my prince, must yield me mickle more.    You know your nobles are your chiefest stays,    And long time have been banish'd from your court:    Embrace and reconcile them to yourself;    They are your hands, whereby you ought to work.    As for Ateukin and his lewd compeers,    That sooth'd you in your sins and youthly pomp,    Exile, torment, and punish such as they;    For greater vipers never may be found    Within a state than such aspiring heads,    That reck not how they climb, so that they climb.    _K. of Scots._ Guid knight, I grant thy suit.--First I submit,    And humbly crave a pardon of your grace:--    Next, courteous queen, I pray thee by thy loves    Forgive mine errors past, and pardon me.--    My lords and princes, if I have misdone    (As I have wrong'd indeed both you and yours),    Hereafter, trust me, you are dear to me.    As for Ateukin, whoso finds the man,    Let him have martial law, and straight be hang'd,    As all his vain abettors now are dead.    And Anderson our treasurer shall pay    Three thousand marks for friendly recompense.    _Nano._ But, princes, whilst you friend it thus in one,    Methinks of friendship Nano shall have none.    _Q. Dor._ What would my dwarf, that I will not bestow?    _Nano._ My boon, fair queen, is this,--that you would go:    Although my body is but small and neat,    My stomach, after toil, requireth meat:    An easy suit, dread princess; will you wend?    _K. of Scots._ Art thou a pigmy-born, my pretty friend?    _Nano._ Not so, great king, but Nature, when she fram'd me,    Was scant of earth, and Nano therefore nam'd me;    And, when she saw my body was so small,    She gave me wit to make it big withal.    _K. of Scots._ Till time when--    _Q. Dor._ Eat, then.    _K. of Scots._ My friend, it stands with wit    To take repast when stomach serveth it.    _Q. Dor._[298] Thy policy, my Nano, shall prevail.--    Come, royal father, enter we my tent:--    And, soldiers, feast it, frolic it, like friends:--    My princes, bid this kind and courteous train    Partake some favours of our late accord.    Thus wars have end, and, after dreadful hate,    Men learn at last to know their good estate.    [_Exeunt omnes._

By The Children     of her Maiesties Reuels. Made by Geo: Chapman. Ben: Jonson. Ioh:     Marston. At London Printed for William Aspley._ 1605. 4to.                         STORY OF THE PLAY.Master Touchstone, an honest goldsmith, has two daughters and twoapprentices. The elder daughter, Gertrude, is proud, extravagant, andwanton; the younger, Mildred, is simple, thrifty, and modest. So withthe apprentices: Quicksilver is a graceless unthrift, but Golding is amodel of industry and sobriety. A needy knight, Sir Petronel Flash,who represents himself to be the owner of a castle, marries Gertrude;and Golding, released from his apprenticeship, marries Mildred. SirPetronel's aim is to acquire some land of which Gertrude is possessed,turn it into ready money, and take ship with some adventurous spiritsfor Virginia, leaving his wife to find her way to the imaginarycastle. Quicksilver, who has been dismissed from Touchstone's servicefor riotous living, introduces Sir Petronel to an old usurer,Security; and Gertrude signs a deed, by which her estate is conveyedinto Security's hands. The knight is in love with Security's wife,Winifred, and is anxious to have her society on the voyage. He tellsSecurity that he intends to run away with the wife of one Bramble, alawyer, and Security enters heartily into the scheme. It is contrivedby Sir Petronel and Quicksilver that on the eve of the voyage Securitybrings Winifred in disguise (imagining her to be Bramble's wife) to ariver-side tavern, where are gathered Sir Petronel, Quicksilver,Seagull (the captain of the ship which is to sail for Virginia),Bramble, and the knight's fellow-passengers, Scapethrift and Spendall.After drinking heavily at the tavern, the company rises to take boatfor Blackwall, where Sir Petronel's ship lies. As there is a stormywind blowing and the tide is against them, the watermen urge that itwould be unsafe to venture; but the company insists in starting, andthe result is that the boats--one driven one way, another another--arecapsized, and the drunken occupants are soused in the Thames. Securityswims ashore at Cuckold's Haven; Winifred is rescued at St.Katherine's; Quicksilver finds himself by the gallows at Wapping; SirPetronel and Seagull are cast-up on the Isle of Dogs, which thecupshot knight takes to be a spot on the French coast. Quicksilverfalls in with Sir Petronel and the two repair to London, where theyare arrested at the suit of Touchstone and, after being examinedbefore Golding (who has been appointed deputy to the alderman of hisward), are committed to the Counter. Here, having leisure to reviewtheir conduct, they become deeply penitent, and set a wholesomeexample to the rest of the prisoners. By Golding's kind offices theyare released from the Counter and are taken into the good graces ofTouchstone, who has had convincing proof of their reformation.Gertrude, though she has been slower to express contrition, finallyhumbles her pride and is received back into favour. Quicksilvermarries his cast mistress, Sindefy, and lives cleanly; Security takesback Winifred.                             PROLOGUS.  Not out of envy, for there's no effect  Where there's no cause; nor out of imitation,  For we have evermore been imitated;[1]  Nor out of our contention to do better  Than that[2] which is opposed to ours in title,  For that was good; and better cannot be:  And for the title, if it seem affected,  We might as well have call'd it, "God[3] you good even:"  Only that eastward westwards still exceeds,  Honour the sun's fair rising, not his setting.                   10  Nor is our title utterly enforced,  As by the points we touch at you shall see.  Bear with our willing pains, if dull or witty,  We only dedicate it to the City.     [1] This tone of arrogant assumption is very characteristic of     Ben Jonson, who probably contributed the prologue. Cf. Prologue     to _Cynthia's Revels_:--          "In this alone his Muse her sweetness hath;          She shuns the print of any beaten path,          And proves new ways to come to learned ears," &c.     [2] The comedy of _Westward Ho_, by Webster and Dekker; it     was not published until 1607.--_Eastward Ho_ and _Westward     Ho_ were the cries of the watermen who plied on the Thames.     [3] A shortened form of "God give you good even."                       _DRAMATIS PERSON®_.[4]  TOUCHSTONE, _a goldsmith_.  QUICKSILVER,}  GOLDING,    } _apprentices to_ TOUCHSTONE.  Sir PETRONEL FLASH, _a shifty knight_.  SECURITY, _an old usurer_.  BRAMBLE, _a lawyer_.  SEAGULL, _a sea-captain_.  SCAPETHRIFT,}  SPENDALL    } _adventurers bound for Virginia_.  SLITGUT, _a butcher's apprentice_.  POLDAVY, _a tailor_.  HOLDFAST,}  WOLF     } _officers of the Counter_.  HAMLET, _a footman_.  POTKIN, _a tankard-bearer_.  Drawer.  Mistress TOUCHSTONE.  GERTRUDE,}  MILDRED  } _her daughters_.  WINIFRED, _wife to_ SECURITY.  SINDEFY, _mistress to_ QUICKSILVER.  BETTRICE, _a waiting-woman_.  Mrs. FORD, Mrs. GAZER, Coachman, Page, Constables, Prisoners, &c.                  SCENE--LONDON AND THAMES-SIDE.     [4] Not marked in old ed.                            EASTWARD HO.                               ACT I.                              SCENE I.                         _Goldsmiths' Row._  _Enter_ Master TOUCHSTONE _and_ QUICKSILVER _at several doors_;     QUICKSILVER _with his hat, pumps, short sword and dagger, and a     racket trussed up under his cloak. At the middle door, enter_     GOLDING, _discovering a goldsmith's shop, and walking short turns     before it_.  _To._ And whither with you now? what loose action  are you bound for? Come, what comrades are you  to meet withal? where's the supper? where's the  rendezvous?  _Qu._ Indeed, and in very good sober truth, sir----  _To._ Indeed, and in very good sober truth, sir! Behind  my back thou wilt swear faster than a French foot-boy,  and talk more bawdily than a common midwife;  and now "indeed and in very good sober truth, sir!"  but if a privy search should be made, with what furniture  are you rigged now? Sirrah, I tell thee, I am thy  master, William Touchstone, goldsmith; and thou my  prentice, Francis Quicksilver, and I will see whither  you are running. Work upon that now.                             14  _Qu._ Why, sir, I hope a man may use his recreation  with his master's profit.  _To._ Prentices' recreations are seldom with their  master's profit. Work upon that now. You shall give  up your cloak, though you be no alderman. Heyday!  ruffians'-hall sword, pumps, here's a racket indeed!                                  [TOUCHSTONE _uncloaks_ QUICKSILVER.  _Qu._ Work upon that now.  _To._ Thou shameless varlet! dost thou jest at thy  lawful master, contrary to thy indentures?                       23  _Qu._ Why 'sblood, sir, my mother's a gentlewoman,  and my father a justice of peace and of Quorum; and  though I am a younger brother and a prentice, yet I  hope I am my father's son; and by God's lid, 'tis for  your worship and for your commodity that I keep company.  I am entertained among gallants, true;[5] they  call me cousin Frank, right; I lend them moneys, good;  they spend it, well. But when they are spent, must not  they strive to get more, must not their land fly? and to  whom? Shall not your worship ha' the refusal? Well,  I am a good member of the city, if I were well considered.  How would merchants thrive, if gentlemen would not be  unthrifts? How could gentlemen be unthrifts if their  humours were not fed? How should their humours be fed  but by white meat, and cunning secondings? Well, the  city might consider us. I am going to an ordinary now:  the gallants fall to play; I carry light gold with me; the  gallants call, "Cousin Frank, some gold for silver;" I  change, gain by it; the gallants lose the gold, and then  call, "Cousin Frank, lend me some silver." Why----               43  _To._ Why? I cannot tell. Seven-score pound art thou  out in the cash; but look to it, I will not be gallanted  out of my moneys. And as for my rising by other men's  fall, God shield me! did I gain my wealth by ordinaries?  no: by exchanging of gold? no: by keeping of gallants'  company? no. I hired me a little shop, fought low,  took small gain, kept no debt-book, garnished my shop,  for want of plate, with good wholesome thrifty sentences;  as, "Touchstone, keep thy shop, and thy shop will keep  thee;" "Light gains makes heavy purses;" "'Tis  good to be merry and wise." And when I was wived,  having something to stick to, I had the horn of suretyship  ever before my eyes. You all know the device of  the horn, where the young fellow slips in at the butt-end,  and comes squeezed out at the buckall: and I grew up,  and I praise providence, I bear my brows now as high  as the best of my neighbours: but thou----well, look to  the accounts; your father's bond lies for you: seven-score  pound is yet in the rear.                                        62  _Qu._ Why 'slid, sir, I have as good, as proper gallants'  words for it as any are in London--gentlemen of good  phrase, perfect language, passingly behaved; gallants that  wear socks and clean linen, and call me "kind cousin  Frank," "good cousin Frank," for they know my father:  and by God's lid shall I not trust 'hem?--not trust?       _Enter a_ Page _as inquiring for_ TOUCHSTONE'S _shop_.  _Go._ What do ye lack, sir? What is't you'll buy, sir?  _To._ Ay, marry sir; there's a youth of another piece.  There's thy fellow-prentice, as good a gentleman born as  thou art: nay, and better meaned. But does he pump  it, or racket it? Well, if he thrive not, if he outlast not  a hundred such crackling bavins as thou art, God and  men neglect industry.                                            75  _Go._ It is his shop, and here my master walks.                                                      [_To the_ Page.  _To._ With me, boy?  _Pa._ My master, Sir Petronel Flash, recommends his  love to you, and will instantly visit you.  _To._ To make up the match with my eldest daughter,  my wife's dilling,[6] whom she longs to call madam. He  shall find me unwillingly ready, boy.                [_Exit_ Page.]  There's another affliction too. As I have two prentices,  the one of a boundless prodigality, the other of a most  hopeful industry--so have I only two daughters: the  eldest, of a proud ambition and nice wantonness; the  other of a modest humility and comely soberness. The  one must be ladified, forsooth, and be attired just to the  court-cut and long tail.[7] So far is she ill-natured to the  place and means of my preferment and fortune, that she  throws all the contempt and despite hatred itself can  cast upon it. Well, a piece of land she has; 'twas her  grandmother's gift; let her, and her Sir Petronel, flash  out that; but as for my substance, she that scorns me,  as I am a citizen and tradesman, shall never pamper her  pride with my industry; shall never use me as men do  foxes, keep themselves warm in the skin, and throw the  body that bare it to the dunghill. I must go entertain  this Sir Petronel. Golding, my utmost care's for thee,  and only trust in thee; look to the shop. As for you,  Master Quicksilver, think of husks, for thy course is  running directly to the prodigal's hog's-trough; husks,  sirrah! Work upon that now.                                                  [_Exit_ TOUCHSTONE.  _Qu._ Marry faugh,[8] goodman flat-cap![9] 'sfoot! though  I am a prentice I can give arms;[10] and my father's a  justice-a-peace by descent, and 'sblood----                     106  _Go._ Fie, how you swear!  _Qu._ 'Sfoot, man, I am a gentleman, and may swear  by my pedigree. God's my life! Sirrah Golding, wilt  be ruled by a fool? Turn good fellow, turn swaggering  gallant, and let the welkin roar, and Erebus also.[11] Look  not westward to the fall of Dan Phoebus, but to the east--Eastward-ho!     _Where radiant beams of lusty Sol appear,      And bright Eous makes the welkin clear._  We are both gentlemen, and therefore should be no  coxcombs: let's be no longer fools to this flat-cap,  Touchstone. Eastward, bully, this satin belly, and  canvas-backed Touchstone: 'slife! man, his father was a  maltman, and his mother sold gingerbread in Christchurch.[12]   121  _Go._ What would you ha' me to do?  _Qu._ Why, do nothing, be like a gentleman, be idle;  the curse of man is labour. Wipe thy bum with testones,  and make ducks and drakes with shillings. What, Eastward-ho!  Wilt thou cry, "what is't ye lack?" stand  with a bare pate, and a dropping nose, under a wooden  pent-house, and art a gentleman? Wilt thou bear  tankards, and mayst bear arms? Be ruled; turn gallant;  Eastward-ho! ta, lirra, lirra, ro! "Who[13] calls Jeronimo?  Speak, here I am." God's so! how like a sheep thou  look'st: o' my conscience, some cowherd begot thee,  thou Golding of Golding-hall! Ha, boy?                          133  _Go._ Go, ye are a prodigal coxcomb! I a cowherd's  son, because I turn not a drunken whore-hunting rake-hell  like thyself!  _Qu._ Rake-hell! rake-hell!                             [_Offers to draw, and_ GOLDING _trips up                                            his heels and holds him_.  _Go._ Pish, in soft terms, ye are a cowardly bragging  boy. I'll ha' you whipt.  _Qu._ Whipt?--that's good, i'faith! untruss me?                 140  _Go._ No, thou wilt undo thyself. Alas! I behold  thee with pity, not with anger: thou common shot-clog,[14]  gull of all companies; methinks I see thee already walk-in  Moorfields[15] without a cloak, with half a hat, without  a band, a doublet with three buttons, without a girdle, a  hose with one point, and no garter, with a cudgel under  thine arm, borrowing and begging threepence.  _Qu._ Nay, 'slife! take this and take all; as I am a  gentleman born, I'll be drunk, grow valiant, and beat  thee.                                                             [_Exit._  _Go._ Go, thou most madly vain, whom nothing can  recover but that which reclaims atheists, and makes  great persons sometimes religious--calamity. As for  my place and life, thus I have read:--                          154     _Whate'er some vainer youth may term disgrace,      The gain of honest pains is never base;      From trades, from arts, from valour, honour springs,      These three are founts of gentry, yea, of kings._  _Enter_ GERTRUDE, MILDRED, BETTRICE, _and_ POLDAVY, _a tailor_;     POLDAVY _with a fair gown, Scotch farthingale and French-fall in     his arms_; GERTRUDE _in a French head-attire, and citizen's     gown_; MILDRED _sewing and_ BETTRICE _leading a monkey after     her_.[16]  _Ge._ For the passion of patience, look if Sir Petronel  approach--that sweet, that fine, that delicate, that--for  love's sake tell me if he come. O sister Mill, though my  father be a low-capped tradesman, yet I must be a lady;  and I praise God my mother must call me madam. Does  he come? Off with this gown, for shame's sake, off with  this gown: let not my knight take me in the city-cut in  any hand: tear't, pax on't (does he come?) tear't off.  "Thus whilst she sleeps, I sorrow for her sake," &c.[17]        167  _Mi._ Lord, sister, with what an immodest impatiency  and disgraceful scorn do you put off your city 'tire; I am  sorry to think you imagine to right yourself in wronging  that which hath made both you and us.  _Ge._ I tell you I cannot endure it, I must be a lady: do  you wear your coif with a London licket,[18] your stammel[19]  petticoat with two guards,[20] the buffin[21] gown with the  tuff-taffety cape, and the velvet lace. I must be a lady,  and I will be a lady. I like some humours of the city-dames  well: to eat cherries[22] only at an angel a pound,  good; to dye rich scarlet, black, pretty; to line a grogram  gown clean thorough with velvet, tolerable; their  pure linen, their smocks of three pounds a smock, are to  be borne withal. But your mincing niceries, taffeta pipkins,  durance[23] petticoats, and silver bodkins--God's  my life, as I shall be a lady, I cannot endure it! Is he  come yet? Lord, what a long knight 'tis! "And ever  she cried, Shoot[24] home!" and yet I knew one longer;  "And ever she cried, Shoot[24] home," fa, la, ly, re, lo, la!  _Mi._ Well, sister, those that scorn their nest, oft fly with  a sick wing.                                                    188  _Ge._ Bow-bell!  _Mi._ Where titles presume to thrust before fit means  to second them, wealth and respect often grow sullen,  and will not follow. For sure in this, I would for your  sake I spake not truth: _Where ambition of place goes before  fitness of birth, contempt and disgrace follow._ I heard  a scholar once say, that Ulysses, when he counterfeited  himself mad, yoked cats[25] and foxes and dogs together to  draw his plough, whiles he followed and sowed salt; but  sure I judge them truly mad, that yoke citizens and  courtiers, tradesmen and soldiers, a goldsmith's daughter  and a knight. Well, sister, pray God my father sow not  salt too.                                                       201  _Ge._ Alas! poor Mildred, when I am a lady, I'll pray  for thee yet, i'faith: nay, and I'll vouchsafe to call thee  sister Mill still; for though thou art not like to be a lady  as I am, yet sure thou art a creature of God's making;  and mayest peradventure to be saved as soon as I (does  he come?). "And ever and anon she doubled in her  song." Now, lady's my comfort, what profane ape's  here? Tailor, Poldavy, prithee, fit it, fit it: is this a right  Scot?[26] Does it clip close, and bear up round?                210  _Po._ Fine and stiffly, i'faith; 'twill keep your thighs so  cool, and make your waist so small; here was a fault in  your body, but I have supplied the defect, with the effect of  my steel instrument, which, though it have but one eye,  can see to rectify the imperfection of the proportion.  _Ge._ Most edifying tailor! I protest you tailors are  most sanctified members, and make many crooked things  go upright. How must I bear my hands? Light?  light?                                                          219  _Po._ O ay, now you are in the lady-fashion, you must  do all things light. Tread light, light. Ay, and fall so:  that's the Court-amble.                                        [_She trips about the stage._  _Ge._ Has the Court ne'er a trot?  _Po._ No, but a false gallop, lady.  _Ge._ _And if she will not go to bed_--                                                           [_Cantat._  _Be._ The knight's come, forsooth.           _Enter_ Sir PETRONEL, Master TOUCHSTONE, _and_                        Mistress TOUCHSTONE.  _Ge._ Is my knight come? O the Lord, my band!  Sister, do my cheeks look well? Give me a little box o'  the ear, that I may seem to blush; now, now! So, there,  there, there! here he is: O my dearest delight! Lord,  Lord! and how does my knight?                                   231  _To._ Fie! with more modesty.  _Ge._ Modesty! why, I am no citizen now--modesty!  Am I not to be married? y'are best to keep me modest,  now I am to be a lady.  _Sir Pe._ Boldness is good fashion and courtlike.  _Ge._ Ay, in a country lady I hope it is, as I shall be.  And how chance ye came no sooner, knight?  _Sir Pe._ 'Faith, I was so entertained in the progress    with one Count Epernoum, a Welsh knight; we had a  match at balloon[27] too with my Lord Whachum, for four  crowns.                                                         242  _Ge._ At baboon? Jesu! you and I will play at baboon  in the country, knight.  _Sir Pe._ O, sweet lady! 'tis a strong play with the  arm.  _Ge._ With arm or leg, or any other member, if it be a  Court-sport. And when shall's be married, my knight?  _Sir Pe._ I come now to consummate it, and your father  may call a poor knight son-in-law.                              250  _M. To._ Sir, ye are come; what is not mine to keep I  must not be sorry to forego. A 100 li. land her grandmother  left her, 'tis yours; herself (as her mother's gift)  is yours. But if you expect aught from me, know, my  hand and mine eyes open together; I do not give blindly.  Work upon that now.  _Sir Pe._ Sir, you mistrust not my means? I am a  knight.  _To._ Sir, sir, what I know not, you will give me leave  to say I am ignorant of.                                        260  _Mist. To._ Yes, that he is a knight; I know where he  had money to pay the gentlemen-ushers and heralds their  fees. Ay, that he is a knight, and so might you have  been too, if you had been aught else than an ass, as well  as some of your neighbours. And I thought you would  not ha' been knighted, as I am an honest woman, I would  ha' dubbed you myself. I praise God I have wherewithal.  But as for your daughter----  _Ge._ Ay, mother, I must be a lady to-morrow; and by  your leave, mother (I speak it not without my duty, but  only in the right of my husband), I must take place of  you, mother.                                                    272  _Mist. To._ That you shall, lady-daughter, and have a  coach as well as I too.  _Ge._ Yes, mother. But by your leave, mother (I speak  it not without my duty, but only in my husband's right),  my coach-horses must take the wall of your coach-horses.  _To._ Come, come, the day grows low; 'tis supper-time;  use my house; the wedding solemnity is at my wife's cost;  thank me for nothing but my [un]willing blessing; for  I cannot feign, my hopes are faint. And, sir, respect  my daughter; she has refused for you wealthy and honest  matches, known good men, well-moneyed, better traded,  best reputed.                                                   284  _Ge._ Body-o'-truth! chittizens,[28] chittizens! Sweet knight,  as soon as ever we are married, take me to thy mercy out  of this miserable chitty; presently carry me out of the  scent of Newcastle coal, and the hearing of Bow-bell; I  beseech thee down with me, for God sake!  _To._ Well, daughter, I have read that old wit sings:--     _The greatest rivers flow from little springs:      Though thou art full, scorn not thy means at first,      He that's most drunk may soonest be athirst._  Work upon that now.                                             294                                [_All but_ TOUCHSTONE, MILDRED, _and_                                                    GOLDING _depart_.  No, no! yond' stand my hopes--Mildred, come hither,  daughter. And how approve you your sister's fashion?  how do you fancy her choice? what dost thou think?  _Mi._ I hope as a sister, well.  _To._ Nay but, nay but, how dost thou like her behaviour  and humour? Speak freely.                                       300  _Mi._ I am loth to speak ill; and yet I am sorry of  this, I cannot speak well.  _To._ Well; very good, as I would wish; a modest  answer. Golding, come hither; hither, Golding. How  dost thou like the knight, Sir Flash? does he not look  big? how likest thou the elephant? he says he has a  castle in the country.  _Go._ Pray heaven, the elephant carry not his castle on  his back.[29]                                                   309  _To._ 'Fore heaven, very well! but seriously, how dost  repute him?  _Go._ The best I can say of him is, I know him not.  _To._ Ha, Golding! I commend thee, I approve thee,  and will make it appear my affection is strong to thee.  My wife has her humour, and I will ha' mine. Dost  thou see my daughter here? She is not fair, well-favoured  or so indifferent, which modest measure of  beauty shall not make it thy only work to watch her,  nor sufficient mischance to suspect her. Thou art  towardly, she is modest; thou art provident, she is  careful. She's now mine; give me thy hand, she's now  thine. Work upon that now.                                      322  _Go._ Sir, as your son, I honour you; and as your  servant, obey you.  _To._ Sayest thou so? Come hither, Mildred. Do  you see yond' fellow? he is a gentleman, though my  prentice, and has somewhat to take too; a youth of  good hope; well friended, well parted.[30] Are you mine?  you are his. Work upon that now.                                329  _Mi._ Sir, I am all yours; your body gave me life;  your care and love, happiness of life; let your virtue  still direct it, for to your wisdom I wholly dispose  myself.  _To._ Say'st thou so? Be you two better acquainted.  Lip her, lip her, knave. So, shut up shop; in.

The nuptial night  will not moisten your throat sufficiently, but the morning  likewise must rain her dews into your gluttonous  weasand.  _Qu._ An't please you, sir, we did but drink (ump) to  the coming off of the knightly bridegroom.  _To._ To the coming off an' him?                                 19  _Qu._ Ay, forsooth, we drunk to his coming on (ump)  when we went to bed; and now we are up, we must  drink to his coming off: for that's the chief honour of a  soldier, sir; and therefore we must drink so much the  more to it, forsooth (ump).  _To._ A very capital reason! So that you go to bed  late, and rise early to commit drunkenness; you fulfil  the scripture very sufficient wickedly, forsooth.  _Qu._ The knight's men, forsooth, be still o' their knees  at it (ump), and because 'tis for your credit, sir, I would  be loth to flinch.                                               30  _To._ I pray, sir, e'en to 'hem again then; y'are one  of the separated crew, one of my wife's faction, and my  young lady's, with whom, and with their great match, I  will have nothing to do.  _Qu._ So, sir, now I will go keep my (ump) credit with  'hem, an't please you, sir.  _To._ In any case, sir, lay one cup of sack more o' your  cold stomach, I beseech you.                                     38  _Qu._ Yes, forsooth.                                                 [_Exit_ QUICKSILVER.  _To._ This is for my credit! servants ever maintain  drunkenness in their master's house for their master's  credit; a good idle serving-man's reason. I thank time  the night is past; I ne'er waked to such cost; I think  we have stowed more sorts of flesh in our bellies than  ever Noah's ark received; and for wine, why my house  turns giddy with it, and more noise in it than at a  conduit. Ay me! even beasts condemn our gluttony.  Well, 'tis our city's fault, which, because we commit  seldom, we commit the more sinfully; we lose no time  in our sensuality, but we make amends for it. O that  we would do so in virtue, and religious negligences!  But see here are all the sober parcels my house can  show; I'll eavesdrop, hear what thoughts they utter  this morning.                                                    54                   _Enter_ GOLDING _and_ MILDRED.  _Go._ But is it possible that you, seeing your sister  preferred to the bed of a knight, should contain your  affections in the arms of a prentice?  _Mi._ I had rather make up the garment of my affections  in some of the same piece, than, like a fool, wear gowns  of two colours, or mix sackcloth with satin.  _Go._ And do the costly garments--the title and fame  of a lady, the fashion, observation, and reverence proper  to such preferment--no more inflame you than such  convenience as my poor means and industry can offer  to your virtues?                                                 65  _Mi._ I have observed that the bridle given to those  violent flatteries of fortune is seldom recovered; they  bear one headlong in desire from one novelty to another,  and where those ranging appetites reign, there is ever  more passion than reason: no stay, and so no happiness.  These hasty advancements are not natural. Nature  hath given us legs to go to our objects; not wings to fly  to them.                                                         73  _Go._ How dear an object you are to my desires I  cannot express; whose fruition would my master's  absolute consent and yours vouchsafe me, I should be  absolutely happy. And though it were a grace so far  beyond my merit, that I should blush with unworthiness  to receive it, yet thus far both my love and my means  shall assure your requital: you shall want nothing fit for  your birth and education; what increase of wealth and  advancement the honest and orderly industry and skill  of our trade will afford in any, I doubt not will be  aspired by me; I will ever make your contentment the  end of my endeavours; I will love you above all; and  only your grief shall be my misery, and your delight my  felicity.                                                        87  _To._ Work upon that now.

I thought thou wouldst  show thy bringing-up; and thou wert a gentleman as I  am, thou wouldst think it no shame to be drunk. Lend  me some money, save my credit; I must dine with the  serving-men and their wives--and their wives, sirrah!           112  _Go._ E'en who you will; I'll not lend thee threepence.  _Qu._ 'Sfoot; lend me some money; _hast thou not  Hiren here?_[33]  _To._ Why, how now, sirrah? what vein's this, ha?  _Qu._ _Who cries on murther?

There, sir, there's your indenture;  all your apparel (that I must know) is on your  back, and from this time my door is shut to you: from  me be free; but for other freedom, and the moneys you  have wasted, Eastward-ho shall not serve you.                   134  _Qu._ Am I free o' my fetters?

I have friends, and I have  acquaintance; I will piss at thy shop-posts, and throw  rotten eggs at thy sign. Work upon that now.                    150                                                  [_Exit staggering._  _To._ Now, sirrah, you! hear you? you shall serve me  no more neither--not an hour longer.  _Go._ What mean you, sir?  _To._ I mean to give thee thy freedom, and with thy  freedom my daughter, and with my daughter a father's  love. And with all these such a portion as shall make  Knight Petronel himself envy thee! Y'are both agreed,  are ye not?  _Am._ With all submission, both of thanks and duty.  _To._ Well then, the great Power of heaven bless and  confirm you. And, Golding, that my love to thee may  not show less than my wife's love to my eldest daughter,  thy marriage feast shall equal the knight's and hers.           163  _Go._ Let me beseech you, no, sir; the superfluity and  cold meat left at their nuptials will with bounty furnish  ours. The grossest prodigality is superfluous cost of  the belly; nor would I wish any invitement of states or  friends, only your reverent[38] presence and witness shall  sufficiently grace and confirm us.                              169  _To._ Son to my own bosom, take her and my blessing.  The nice fondling, my lady, sir-reverence, that I must not  now presume to call daughter, is so ravished with desire  to hansell her new coach, and see her knight's Eastward  Castle, that the next morning will sweat with her busy  setting forth. Away will she and her mother, and while  their preparation is making, ourselves, with some two  or three other friends, will consummate the humble  match we have in God's name concluded.     'Tis to my wish, for I have often read,      Fit birth, fit age, keeps long a quiet bed.                 180     'Tis to my wish; for tradesmen, well 'tis known,      Get with more ease than gentry keeps his own.                                                           [_Exeunt._     [31] A hackneyed quotation from _Tamburlaine_.     [32] Old ed. "Am pum pull eo," &c.     [33] A favourite quotation of Pistol's ("_Have we_ not Hiren     here?"). It is supposed to come from Peele's lost play _The     Turkish Mahomet and Hyren the Fair Greek_.     [34] This line would seem to belong to the _Spanish     Tragedy_, but it is not in the text that has come down. When     Horatio is stabbed by the assassins, Bellimperia cries:--"Murder!     murder! Help, Hieronimo, help!" She is forced off the stage, and     then Hieronimo enters, exclaiming, "What outcries pluck me from     my naked bed!" (a much-ridiculed line). But in a passage of     Jonson's _Poetaster_ (iii. 1), where there is clearly an     allusion to Jeronimo, we find the line (slightly altered) that     Quicksilver quotes:--          "_2d Pyr._ Ay, but somebody must cry _Murder!_          then in a small voice.          _Tuc._ Your fellow-sharer there shall do't: cry,          sirrah, cry!          _1st Pyr._ _Murder, murder!_          _2d Pyr._ _Who calls out murder? lady, was it you?_"     [35] "_I.e._, will make you go to Tyburn.

Again in the third part,     sig. C, 'the end of such (though they scape a while)     will be sailing _Westward in a carte to     Tiborn_.'"--_Reed._     [36]  "When this eternal substance of my soul            Did live imprison'd in my wanton flesh,            Each in their function serving other's need,            I was a courtier in the Spanish court:            My name was Don Andrea."     --Opening lines of the _Spanish Tragedy_.     [37] Broken pieces of gold.     [38] Frequently used for _reverend_.                             SCENE II.                   _Room in_ SECURITY'S _house_.                         SECURITY _solus_.  _Sec._ My privy guest, lusty Quicksilver, has drunk too  deep of the bride-bowl; but with a little sleep, he is  much recovered; and, I think, is making himself ready  to be drunk in a gallanter likeness. My house is as  'twere the cave where the young outlaw hoards the  stolen vails of his occupation; and here, when he will  revel it in his prodigal similitude, he retires to his trunks,  and (I may say softly) his punks; he dares trust me  with the keeping of both; for I am Security itself; my  name is Security, the famous usurer.                                                             [_Exit._                            SCENE III.                   _Room in_ SECURITY'S _house_.  _Enter_ QUICKSILVER _in his prentice's coat and cap, his gallant     breeches and stockings, gartering himself_, SECURITY _following_.  _Qu._ Come, old Security, thou father of destruction!  th' indented sheepskin is burned wherein I was wrapt;  and I am now loose, to get more children of perdition  into thy usurous bonds. Thou feed'st my lechery, and  I thy covetousness; thou art pander to me for my  wench, and I to thee for thy cozenages.

Let not master courtier think he carries  all the knavery on his shoulders: I have known poor  Hob, in the country, that has worn hob-nails on's hoes,  have as much villainy in's head as he that wears gold  buttons in's cap.                                                14  _Qu._ Why, man, 'tis the London highway to thrift;  if virtue be used, 'tis but as a scape to the net of  villainy. They that use it simply, thrive simply, I  warrant. Weight and fashion makes goldsmiths cuckolds.       _Enter_ SINDEFY, _with_ QUICKSILVER'S _doublet, cloak,                        rapier, and dagger_.  _Si._ Here, sir, put off the other half of your prenticeship.  _Qu._  Well said, sweet Sin! Bring forth my bravery.  Now let my trunks shoot[40] forth their silks conceal'd.         22  I now am free, and now will justify  My trunks and punks. Avaunt, dull flatcap, then!  _Via_ the curtain that shadow'd Borgia![41]  There lie, thou husk of my envassail'd state,  I, Sampson, now have burst the Philistines' bands,  And in thy lap, my lovely Dalila,  I'll lie, and snore out my enfranchised state.       _When_[42] _Sampson was a tall young man,                     30       His power and strength increased than;       He sold no more nor cup nor can;       But did them all despise.       Old Touchstone, now write to thy friends       For one to sell thy base gold-ends;       Quicksilver now no more attends       Thee, Touchstone._  But, dad, hast thou seen my running gelding dressed  to-day?  _Sec._ That I have, Frank.  The ostler a'th' Cock  dressed him for a breakfast.                                     41  _Qu._ What! did he eat him?  _Sec._ No, but he eat his breakfast for dressing him;  and so dressed him for breakfast.  _Qu._ O witty age! where age is young in wit,  And all youths' words have gray-beards full of it!  _Sec._ But alas, Frank! how will all this be maintained  now? Your place maintained it before.                            48  _Qu._ Why, and I maintained my place. I'll to the  court: another manner of place for maintenance, I  hope, than the silly City! I heard my father say, I  heard my mother sing an old song and a true: _Thou_  _art a she-fool, and know'st not what belongs to our male  wisdom._ I shall be a merchant, forsooth! trust my  estate in a wooden trough as he does! What are these  ships but tennis-balls for the winds to play withal?  tossed from one wave to another; now under line, now  over the house; sometimes brick-walled against a rock,  so that the guts fly out again; sometimes strook under  the wide hazard, and farewell, master merchant!                  60  _Si._ Well, Frank, well: the seas you say, are uncertain:  but he that sails in your Court seas shall find 'hem ten  times fuller of hazard; wherein to see what is to be seen  is torment more than a free spirit can endure; but when  you come to suffer, how many injuries swallow you!  What care and devotion must you use to humour an  imperious lord, proportion your looks to his looks,  smiles to his smiles; fit your sails to the winds of his  breath!  _Qu._ Tush! he's no journeyman in his craft that  cannot do that.                                                  71  _Si._ But he's worse than a prentice that does it; not  only humouring the lord, but every trencher-bearer,  every groom, that by indulgence and intelligence crept  into his favour, and by panderism into his chamber;  he rules the roast; and when my honourable lord says  it shall be thus, my worshipful rascal, the groom of his  close stool, says it shall not be thus, claps the door  after him, and who dares enter? A prentice, quoth  you? 'Tis but to learn to live; and does that disgrace  a man? He that rises hardly stands firmly; but he  that rises with ease, alas! falls as easily.                     82  _Qu._ A pox on you! who taught you this morality?  _Sec._ 'Tis 'long of this witty age, Master Francis. But,  indeed, Mistress Sindefy, all trades complain of inconvenience,  and therefore 'tis best to have none. The  merchant, he complains and says, traffic is subject to  much uncertainty and loss; let 'hem keep their goods  on dry land, with a vengeance, and not expose other  men's substances to the mercy of the winds, under protection  of a wooden wall (as Master Francis says); and  all for greedy desire to enrich themselves with unconscionable  gain, two for one, or so; where I, and  such other honest men as live by lending money, are  content with moderate profit; thirty or forty i' th' hundred,  so we may have it with quietness, and out of peril  of wind and weather, rather than run those dangerous  courses of trading, as they do.                                  98                                                 [_Exit_[43] SINDEFY.  _Qu._ Ay, dad, thou may'st well be called Security, for  thou takest the safest course.  _Sec._ 'Faith, the quieter, and the more contented, and,  out of doubt, the more godly; for merchants, in their  courses, are never pleased, but ever repining against  heaven: one prays for a westerly wind, to carry his ship  forth; another for an easterly, to bring his ship home,  and at every shaking of a leaf[44] he falls into an agony,  to think what danger his ship is in on such a coast, and  so forth. The farmer, he is ever at odds with the  weather: sometimes the clouds have been too barren;  sometimes the heavens forget themselves; their harvests  answer not their hopes; sometimes the season falls out  too fruitful, corn will bear no price, and so forth. The  artificer, he's all for a stirring world: if his trade be too  full, and fall short of his expectation, then falls he out  of joint. Where we that trade nothing but money are  free from all this; we are pleased with all weathers,  let it rain or hold up, be calm or windy; let the season  be whatsoever, let trade go how it will, we take all in  good part, e'en what please the heavens to send us, so  the sun stand not still, and the moon keep her usual  returns, and make up days, months, and years.                   121  _Qu._ And you have good security?  _Sec._ Ay, marry, Frank, that's the special point.  _Qu._ And yet, forsooth, we must have trades to live  withal; for we cannot stand without legs, nor fly without  wings, and a number of such scurvy phrases. No,  I say still, he that has wit, let him live by his wit; he  that has none, let him be a tradesman.  _Sec._ Witty Master Francis! 'tis pity any trade should  dull that quick brain of yours. Do but bring Knight  Petronel into my parchment toils once, and you shall  never need to toil in any trade, o' my credit. You know  his wife's land?                                                133  _Qu._ Even to a foot, sir; I have been often there; a  pretty fine seat, good land, all entire within itself.  _Sec._ Well wooded?  _Qu._ Two hundred pounds' worth of wood ready to  fell, and a fine sweet house, that stands just in the  midst on't, like a prick in the midst of a circle; would  I were your farmer, for a hundred pound a year!  _Sec._ Excellent Master Francis! how I do long to do  thee good! How I do hunger and thirst to have the  honour to enrich thee! ay, even to die, that thou  mightest inherit my living! even hunger and thirst! for  o' my religion, Master Francis, and so tell Knight  Petronel, I do it to do him a pleasure.                         146  _Qu._ Marry, dad! his horses are now coming up to  bear down his lady; wilt thou lend him thy stable to  set 'hem in?  _Sec._ 'Faith, Master Francis, I would be loth to lend  my stable out of doors; in a greater matter I will pleasure  him, but not in this.  _Qu._ A pox of your hunger and thirst! Well, dad, let  him have money; all he could any way get is bestowed  on a ship now bound for Virginia; the frame of which  voyage is so closely conveyed that his new lady nor any  of her friends know it. Notwithstanding, as soon as  his lady's hand is gotten to the sale of her inheritance,  and you have furnished him with money, he will instantly  hoist sail and away.                                            160  _Sec._ Now, a frank gale of wind go with him, Master  Frank! we have too few such knight adventurers; who  would not sell away competent certainties to purchase,  with any danger, excellent uncertainties? your true knight  venturer ever does. Let his wife seal to-day; he shall  have his money to-day.  _Qu._ To-morrow she shall, dad, before she goes into  the country; to work her to which action with the more  engines, I purpose presently to prefer my sweet Sin here  to the place of her gentlewoman; whom you (for the  more credit) shall present as your friend's daughter, a  gentlewoman of the country, new come up with a will  for awhile to learn fashions forsooth, and be toward some  lady; and she shall buzz pretty devices into her lady's  ear; feeding her humours so serviceably (as the manner  of such as she is, you know).                                   176  _Sec._ True, good Master Francis.                        _Re-enter_ SINDEFY.  _Qu._ That she shall keep her port open to anything  she commends to her.  _Sec._ O' my religion, a most fashionable project; as  good she spoil the lady, as the lady spoil her; for 'tis  three to one of one side. Sweet Mistress Sin, how are  you bound to Master Francis! I do not doubt to see  you shortly wed one of the head-men[45] of our city.  _Si._ But, sweet Frank, when shall my father Security  present me?                                                     186  _Qu._ With all festination; I have broken the ice to it  already; and will presently to the knight's house, whither,  my good old dad, let me pray thee, with all formality to  man her.  _Sec._ Command me, Master Francis, I do hunger and  thirst to do thee service. Come, sweet Mistress Sin,  take leave of my Winifred, and we will instantly meet  Frank, Master Francis, at your lady's.                      _Enter_ WINIFRED _above_.  _Wi._ Where is my Cu there? Cu?  _Sec._ Ay, Winnie.                                              196  _Wi._ Wilt thou come in, sweet Cu?  _Sec._ Ay, Winnie, presently.                                    [_Exeunt_ SECURITY _and_ SINDEFY.  _Qu._ Ay, Winnie, quod he, that's all he can do, poor  man, he may well cut off her name at Winnie. O, 'tis  an egregious pander! What will not an usurous knave  be, so he may be rich? O, 'tis a notable Jew's trump!  I hope to live to see dogs' meat made of the old usurer's  flesh, dice of his bones, and indentures of his skin; and  yet his skin is too thick to make parchment, 'twould  make good boots for a peter-man[46] to catch salmon in.  Your only smooth skin to make fine vellum is your  Puritan's skin; they be the smoothest and slickest knaves  in a country.                                                   209      _Enter_ Sir PETRONEL _in boots, with a riding-wand_.[47]  _Pe._ I'll out of this wicked town as fast as my horse  can trot! Here's now no good action for a man to  spend his time in. Taverns grow dead; ordinaries are  blown up; plays are at a stand; houses of hospitality  at a fall; not a feather waving, nor a spur jingling anywhere.  I'll away instantly.  _Qu._ Y'ad best take some crowns in your purse, knight,  or else your Eastward Castle will smoke but miserably.  _Pe._ O, Frank! my castle? Alas! all the castles I  have are built with air, thou know'st.                          219  _Qu._ I know it, knight, and therefore wonder whither  your lady is going.  _Pe._ 'Faith, to seek her fortune, I think. I said I had  a castle and land eastward, and eastward she will, without  contradiction; her coach and the coach of the sun  must meet full butt. And the sun being outshined with  her ladyship's glory, she fears he goes westward to hang  himself.  _Qu._ And I fear, when her enchanted castle becomes  invisible, her ladyship will return and follow his example.  _Pe._ Oh, that she would have the grace! for I shall  never be able to pacify her, when she sees herself deceived  so.                                                             232  _Qu._ As easily as can be. Tell her she mistook your  directions, and that shortly yourself will down with her  to approve it; and then clothe but her crouper in a new  gown, and you may drive her any way you list. For  these women, sir, are like Essex calves, you must wriggle  'hem on by the tail still, or they will never drive orderly.  _Pe._ But, alas! sweet Frank, thou knowest my ability  will not furnish her blood with those costly humours.  _Qu._ Cast that cost on me, sir. I have spoken to my  old pander, Security, for money or commodity; and commodity  (if you will) I know he will procure you.                       243  _Pe._ Commodity! Alas! what commodity?  _Qu._ Why, sir! what say you to figs and raisins?  _Pe._ A plague of figs and raisins, and all such frail[48]  commodities! We shall make nothing of 'hem.  _Qu._ Why then, sir, what say you to forty pound in  roasted beef?[49]  _Pe._ Out upon't, I have less stomach to that than to  the figs and raisins; I'll out of town, though I sojourn  with a friend of mine, for stay here I must not; my  creditors have laid to arrest me, and I have no friend  under heaven but my sword to bail me.                           254  _Qu._ God's me, knight, put 'hem in sufficient sureties,  rather than let your sword bail you! Let 'hem take their  choice, either the King's Bench or the Fleet, or which of  the two Counters they like best, for, by the Lord, I like  none of 'hem.  _Pe._ Well, Frank, there is no jesting with my earnest  necessity; thou know'st if I make not present money to  further my voyage begun, all's lost, and all I have laid  out about it.                                                   263  _Qu._ Why, then, sir, in earnest, if you can get your  wise lady to set her hand to the sale of her inheritance,  the bloodhound, Security, will smell out ready money  for you instantly.  _Pe._ There spake an angel: to bring her to which  conformity, I must feign myself extremely amorous;  and alleging urgent excuses for my stay behind, part  with her as passionately as she would from her foisting  hound.[50]                                                      272  _Qu._ You have the sow by the right ear, sir. I warrant  there was never child longed more to ride a cock-horse  or wear his new coat, than she longs to ride in her new  coach. She would long for everything when she was a  maid, and now she will run mad for 'hem. I lay my life,  she will have every year four children; and what charge  and change of humour you must endure while she is with  child, and how she will tie you to your tackling till she  be with child, a dog would not endure. Nay, there is  no turnspit dog bound to his wheel[51] more servilely than  you shall be to her wheel; for, as that dog can never  climb the top of his wheel but when the top comes under  him, so shall you never climb the top of her contentment  but when she is under you.                                      286  _Pe._ 'Slight, how thou terrifiest me!  _Qu._ Nay, hark you, sir; what nurses, what midwives,  what fools, what physicians, what cunning women must  be sought for (fearing sometimes she is bewitched, sometimes  in a consumption), to tell her tales, to talk bawdy  to her, to make her laugh, to give her glisters, to let her  blood under the tongue and betwixt the toes; how she  will revile and kiss you, spit in your face, and lick it off  again; how she will vaunt you are her creature; she made  you of nothing; how she could have had thousand mark  jointures; she could have been made a lady by a Scotch  knight, and never ha' married him; she could have had  ponados[52] in her bed every morning; how she set you  up, and how she will pull you down: you'll never be able  to stand of your legs to endure it.                             301  _Pe._ Out of my fortune, what a death is my life bound  face to face to! The best is, a large time-fitted conscience  is bound to nothing: marriage is but a form in  the school of policy, to which scholars sit fastened only  with painted chains. Old Security's young wife is ne'er  the further off with me.  _Qu._ Thereby lies a tale, sir. The old usurer will be  here instantly, with my punk Sindefy, whom you know  your lady has promised me to entertain for her gentlewoman;  and he (with a purpose to feed on you) invites  you most solemnly by me to supper.                              312  _Pe._ It falls out excellently fitly: I see desire of gain  makes jealousy venturous.                         _Enter_ GERTRUDE.  See, Frank, here comes my lady. Lord! how she views  thee! she knows thee not, I think, in this bravery.  _Ge._ How now? who be you, I pray?  _Qu._ One Master Francis Quicksilver, an't please your  ladyship.  _Ge._ God's my dignity! as I am a lady, if he did not  make me blush so that mine eyes stood a-water. Would  I were unmarried again!                                         322                  _Enter_ SECURITY _and_ SINDEFY.  Where's my woman, I pray?  _Qu._ See, madam, she now comes to attend you.  _Sec._ God save my honourable knight and his worshipful  lady.  _Ge._ Y'are very welcome; you must not put on your  hat yet.  _Sec._ No, madam; till I know your ladyship's further  pleasure, I will not presume.  _Ge._ And is this a gentleman's daughter new come out  of the country?                                                 332  _Sec._ She is, madam; and one that her father hath a  special care to bestow in some honourable lady's service,  to put her out of her honest humours, forsooth; for she  had a great desire to be a nun, an't please you.  _Ge._ A nun? what nun? a nun substantive? or a nun  adjective?  _Sec._ A nun substantive, madam, I hope, if a nun be a  noun. But I mean, lady, a vowed maid of that order.  _Ge._ I'll teach her to be a maid of the order, I warrant  you. And can you do any work belongs to a lady's  chamber?                                                        343  _Si._ What I cannot do, madam, I would be glad to  learn.  _Ge._ Well said; hold up, then; hold up your head, I  say; come hither a little.  _Si._ I thank your ladyship.  _Ge._ And hark you, good man, you may put on your  hat now; I do not look on you. I must have you of  my faction now; not of my knight's, maid.                       351  _Si._ No, forsooth, madam, of yours.  _Ge._ And draw all my servants in my bow, and keep  my counsel, and tell me tales, and put me riddles, and  read on a book sometimes when I am busy, and laugh  at country gentlewomen, and command anything in the  house for my retainers; and care not what you spend,  for it is all mine; and in any case be still a maid, whatsoever  you do, or whatsoever any man can do unto you.  _Sec._ I warrant your ladyship for that.                        360  _Ge._ Very well; you shall ride in my coach with me  into the country, to-morrow morning. Come, knight,  pray thee let's make a short supper, and to bed presently.  _Sec._ Nay, good madam, this night I have a short  supper at home waits on his worship's acceptation.  _Ge._ By my faith, but he shall not go, sir; I shall  swoon and he sup from me.  _Pe._ Pray thee, forbear; shall he lose his provision?  _Ge._ Ay, by-lady, sir, rather than I lose my longing.  Come in, I say; as I am a lady, you shall not go.               370  _Qu._ I told him what a burr he had gotten.  _Sec._ If you will not sup from your knight, madam, let  me entreat your ladyship to sup at my house with him.  _Ge._ No, by my faith, sir; then we cannot be abed  soon enough after supper.  _Pe._ What a medicine is this! Well, Master Security,  you are new married as well as I; I hope you are bound  as well. We must honour our young wives, you know.  _Qu._ In policy, dad, till to-morrow she has sealed.  _Sec._ I hope in the morning yet your knighthood will  breakfast with me?                                              381  _Pe._ As early as you will, sir.  _Sec._ I thank your good worship; I do hunger and  thirst to do you good, sir.  _Ge._ Come, sweet knight, come; I do hunger and  thirst to be abed with thee.                                                           [_Exeunt._     [39] "Ka me, ka thee"--one good turn deserves another.

I am new married to this fair  gentlewoman, you know; and by my hope to make her  fruitful, though I be something in years, I vow faithfully  unto you to make you godfather, though in your absence,  to the first child I am blest withal; and henceforth call  me gossip, I beseech you, if you please to accept it.            13  _Pe._ In the highest degree of gratitude, my most worthy  gossip; for confirmation of which friendly title, let me  entreat my fair gossip, your wife here, to accept this  diamond, and keep it as my gift to her first child, wheresoever  my fortune, in event of my voyage, shall bestow  me.  _Sec._ How now, my coy wedlock;[53] I make you strange  of so noble a favour? Take it, I charge you, with all  affection, and, by way of taking your leave, present  boldly your lips to our honourable gossip.                       23  _Qu._ How venturous he is to him, and how jealous to  others!  _Pe._ Long may this kind touch of our lips print in our  hearts all the forms of affection. And now, my good  gossip, if the writings be ready to which my wife should  seal, let them be brought this morning before she takes  coach into the country, and my kindness shall work her  to despatch it.                                                  31  _Sec._ The writings are ready, sir. My learned counsel  here, Master Bramble the lawyer, hath perused them;  and within this hour I will bring the scrivener with them  to your worshipful lady.  _Pe._ Good Master Bramble, I will here take my leave  of you then. God send you fortunate pleas, sir, and  contentious clients!  _Br._ And you foreright winds, sir, and a fortunate  voyage.                                                             [_Exit._                        _Enter a_ Messenger.  _Me._ Sir Petronel, here are three or four gentlemen  desire to speak with you.                                        42  _Pe._ What are they?  _Qu._ They are your followers in this voyage, knight:  Captain Seagull and his associates; I met them this  morning, and told them you would be here.  _Pe._ Let them enter, I pray you; I know they long to  be gone, for their stay is dangerous.           _Enter_ SEAGULL, SCAPETHRIFT, _and_ SPENDALL.  _Sea._ God save my honourable colonel!                           49  _Pe._ Welcome, good Captain Seagull, and worthy  gentlemen. If you will meet my friend Frank here, and  me, at the Blue Anchor Tavern by Billingsgate this  evening, we will there drink to our happy voyage, be  merry, and take boat to our ship with all expedition.  _Sp._ Defer it no longer, I beseech you, sir; but as your  voyage is hitherto carried closely, and in another knight's  name, so for your own safety and ours, let it be continued:  our meeting and speedy purpose of departing known to  as few as is possible, lest your ship and goods be  attached.                                                        60  _Qu._ Well advised, captain; our colonel shall have  money this morning to despatch all our departures;  bring those gentlemen at night to the place appointed,  and, with our skins full of vintage, we'll take occasion by  the vantage,[54] and away.  _Sp._ We will not fail, but be there, sir.  _Pe._ Good morrow, good captain, and my worthy  associates. Health and all sovereignty to my beautiful  gossip; for you, sir, we shall see you presently with the  writings.                                                        70  _Sec._ With writings and crowns to my honourable  gossip. I do hunger and thirst to do you good, sir.                                                           [_Exeunt._     [53] Wife.     [54] Collier compares Nashe's _Summer's Last Will_,     &c.:--"Our vintage was a vintage, for it did not work upon the     advantage."                              SCENE II.                           _An inn-yard._        _Enter a_ Coachman _in haste, in his frock, feeding_.  _Co._ Here's a stir when citizens ride out of town, indeed  as if all the house were a-fire!

T._ Ay, by'r lady, madam; a little thing does  that; I have seen a little prick no bigger than a pin's  head swell bigger and bigger, till it has come to an  ancome;[57] and e'en so 'tis in these cases.                          _Enter_ HAMLET.  _Ha._ Your coach is coming, madam.  _Ge._ That's well said. Now, heaven! methinks I am  e'en up to the knees in preferment.                              40  _But a little higher, but a little higher, but a little higher,  There, there, there lies Cupid's fire!_  _Mist. T._ But must this young man, an't please you,  madam, run by your coach all the way a-foot?  _Ge._ Ay, by my faith, I warrant him; he gives no other  milk, as I have another servant does.  _Mist. T._ Alas! 'tis e'en pity, methinks; for God's sake,  madam, buy him but a hobby-horse; let the poor youth  have something betwixt his legs to ease 'hem. Alas! we  must do as we would be done to.                                  50  _Ge._ Go to, hold your peace, dame; you talk like an  old fool, I tell you!              _Enter_ Sir PETRONEL _and_ QUICKSILVER.  _Pe._ Wilt thou be gone, sweet honey-suckle, before I  can go with thee?  _Ge._ I pray thee, sweet knight, let me; I do so long to  dress up thy castle afore thou comest. But I marle how  my modest sister occupies herself this morning, that she  cannot wait on me to my coach, as well as her mother.  _Qu._ Marry, madam, she's married by this time to  prentice Golding. Your father, and some one more,  stole to church with 'hem in all the haste, that the cold  meat left at your wedding might serve to furnish their  nuptial table.                                                   63  _Ge._ There's no base fellow, my father, now; but he's  e'en fit to father such a daughter: he must call me  daughter no more now: but "madam," and "please you,  madam;" and "please your worship, madam," indeed.  Out upon him! marry his daughter to a base prentice!  _Mist. T._ What should one do? Is there no law for  one that marries a woman's daughter against her will?  How shall we punish him, madam?                                  71  _Ge._ As I am a lady, an't would snow, we'd so pebble  'hem with snow-balls as they come from church; but,  sirrah Frank Quicksilver.  _Qu._ Ay, madam.  _Ge._ Dost remember since thou and I clapt what-d'ye-call'ts  in the garret?  _Qu._ I know not what you mean, madam.  _Ge._ _His_[58] _head as white as milk, all flaxen was his hair;_  _But now he is dead, and laid in his bed,_                       80  _And never will come again._  God be at your labour!     _Enter_ TOUCHSTONE, GOLDING, MILDRED, _with rosemary_.[59]  _Pe._ Was there ever such a lady?  _Qu._ See, madam, the bride and bridegroom!  _Ge._ God's my precious! God give you joy, mistress.  What lack you? Now out upon thee, baggage! My  sister married in a taffeta hat! Marry, hang you!  Westward with a wanion[60] t'ye! Nay, I have done wi'  ye, minion, then, i'faith; never look to have my  countenance any more, nor anything I can do for thee.  Thou ride in my coach, or come down to my castle! fie  upon thee! I charge thee in my ladyship's name, call  me sister no more.                                               93  _To._ An't please your worship, this is not your sister:  this is my daughter, and she calls me father, and so does  not your ladyship, an't please your worship, madam.  _Mist. T._ No, nor she must not call thee father by  heraldry, because thou makest thy prentice thy son as  well as she. Ah! thou misproud prentice, darest thou  presume to marry a lady's sister?                               100  _Go._ It pleased my master, forsooth, to embolden me  with his favour; and though I confess myself far unworthy  so worthy a wife (being in part her servant, as I am your  prentice) yet (since I may say it without boasting) I am  born a gentleman, and by the trade I have learned of my  master (which I trust taints not my blood), able, with  mine own industry and portion, to maintain your  daughter, my hope is, heaven will so bless our humble  beginning, that in the end I shall be no disgrace to the  grace with which my master has bound me his double  prentice.                                                       111  _To._ Master me no more, son, if thou think'st me  worthy to be thy father.  _Ge._ Son! Now, good Lord, how he shines! and you  mark him, he's a gentleman!  _Go._ Ay, indeed, madam, a gentleman born.  _Pe._ Never stand o' your gentry, Master Bridegroom;  if your legs be no better than your arms, you'll be able  to stand upright on neither shortly.                            119  _To._ An't please your good worship, sir, there are two  sorts of gentlemen.  _Pe._ What mean you, sir?  _To._ Bold to put off my hat to your worship----  _Pe._ Nay, pray forbear, sir, and then forth with your  two sorts of gentlemen.  _To._ If your worship will have it so, I say there are  two sorts of gentlemen. There is a gentleman artificial,  and a gentleman natural. Now though your worship be  a gentleman natural: work upon that now.                        129  _Qu._ Well said, old Touchstone; I am proud to  hear thee enter a set speech, i'faith; forth, I beseech  thee.  _To._ Cry your mercy, sir, your worship's a gentleman I  do not know. If you be one of my acquaintance, y'are  very much disguised, sir.  _Qu._ Go to, old quipper; forth with thy speech, I  say.                                                            137  _To._ What, sir, my speeches were ever in vain to your  gracious worship; and therefore, till I speak to you  gallantry indeed, I will save my breath for my broth anon.  Come, my poor son and daughter, let us hide ourselves in  our poor humility, and live safe. Ambition consumes  itself with the very show. Work upon that now.  _Ge._ Let him go, let him go, for God's sake! let him  make his prentice his son, for God's sake! give away  his daughter, for God's sake! and when they come a-begging  to us for God's sake, let's laugh at their good  husbandry for God's sake. Farewell, sweet knight, pray  thee make haste after.                                          149  _Pe._ What shall I say?--I would not have thee go.  _Qu._ _Now,_[61] _O now, I must depart,        _Parting though it absence move._  This ditty, knight, do I see in thy looks in capital  letters.        _What a grief 'tis to depart, and leave the flower that           has my heart!_        _My sweet lady, and alack for woe, why, should we           part so?_  Tell truth, knight, and shame all dissembling lovers;  does not your pain lie on that side?                            158  _Pe._ If it do, canst thou tell me how I may cure it?  _Qu._ Excellent easily. Divide yourself in two halves,  just by the girdlestead; send one half with your lady,  and keep t'other yourself; or else do as all true lovers  do--part with your heart, and leave your body behind.  I have seen't done a hundred times: 'tis as easy a matter  for a lover to part without a heart from his sweetheart,  and he ne'er the worse, as for a mouse to get from a trap  and leave her [_sic_] tail behind him. See, here comes the  writings.                                                       168                _Enter_ SECURITY _with a_ Scrivener.  _Sec._ Good morrow to my worshipful lady. I present  your ladyship with this writing, to which if you please to  set your hand with your knight's, a velvet gown shall  attend your journey, o' my credit.  _Ge._ What writing is it, knight?  _Pe._ The sale, sweetheart, of the poor tenement I told  thee of, only to make a little money to send thee down  furniture for my castle, to which my hand shall lead  thee.  _Ge._ Very well. Now give me your pen, I pray.  _Qu._ It goes down without chewing, i'faith.  _Scr._ Your worships deliver this as your deed?                 180  _Ambo._ We do.  _Ge._ So now, knight, farewell till I see thee.  _Pe._ All farewell to my sweetheart!  _Mist. T._ God-b'w'y', son knight.  _Pe._ Farewell, my good mother.  _Ge._ Farewell, Frank; I would fain take thee down if  I could.  _Qu._ I thank your good ladyship; farewell, Mistress  Sindefy.                                                           [_Exeunt._  _Pe._ O tedious voyage, whereof there is no end!  What will they think of me?                                     191  _Qu._ Think what they list. They longed for a vagary  into the country, and now they are fitted. So a woman  marry to ride in a coach, she cares not if she ride to her  ruin. 'Tis the great end of many of their marriages.  This is not the first time a lady has rid a false journey in  her coach, I hope.  _Pe._ Nay, 'tis no matter, I care little what they think;  he that weighs men's thoughts has his hands full of  nothing. A man, in the course of this world, should be  like a surgeon's instrument--work in the wounds of  others, and feel nothing himself. The sharper and  subtler, the better.                                            203  _Qu._ As it falls out now, knight, you shall not need  to devise excuses, or endure her outcries, when she returns;  we shall now begone before, where they cannot  reach us.  _Pe._ Well, my kind compeer, you have now the assurance  we both can make you; let me now entreat you,  the money we agreed on may be brought to the Blue  Anchor, near to Billingsgate, by six o'clock; where I and  my chief friends, bound for this voyage, will with feasts  attend you.                                                     213  _Sec._ The money, my most honourable compeer, shall  without fail observe your appointed hour.  _Pe._ Thanks, my dear gossip. I must now impart  To your approved love, a loving secret;  As one on whom my life doth more rely  In friendly trust than any man alive.  Nor shall you be the chosen secretary                           220  Of my affections for affection only:  For I protest (if God bless my return)  To make you partner in my actions' gain  As deeply as if you had ventured with me  Half my expenses. Know then, honest gossip,  I have enjoy'd with such divine contentment  A gentlewoman's bed whom you well know,  That I shall ne'er enjoy this tedious voyage,  Nor live the least part of the time it asketh,  Without her presence; so I thirst and hunger                    230  To taste the dear feast of her company.  And if the hunger and the thirst you vow  As my sworn gossip, to my wishd good  Be, as I know it is, unfeign'd and firm,  Do me an easy favour in your power.  _Sec._ Be sure, brave gossip, all that I can do,  To my best nerve, is wholly at your service:  Who is the woman, first, that is your friend?  _Pe._ The woman is your learned counsel's wife,  The lawyer, Master Bramble; whom would you                      240  Bring out this even in honest neighbourhood,  To take his leave with you, of me your gossip,  I, in the meantime, will send this my friend  Home to his house, to bring his wife disguised,  Before his face, into our company;  For love hath made her look for such a wile,  To free her from his tyrannous jealousy.  And I would take this course before another,  In stealing her away to make us sport,  And gull his circumspection the more grossly;                   250  And I am sure that no man like yourself  Hath credit with him to entice his jealousy  To so long stay abroad as may give time  To her enlargement, in such safe disguise.  _Sec._ A pretty, pithy, and most pleasant project!  Who would not strain a point of neighbourhood  For such a point device? that as the ship[62]  Of famous Draco went about the world,  Will wind about the lawyer, compassing  The world himself; he hath it in his arms,                      260  And that's enough for him, without his wife.  A lawyer is ambitious, and his head  Cannot be praised nor raised too high,  With any fork of highest knavery.  I'll go fetch her straight.                                                    [_Exit_ SECURITY.  _Pe._ So, so.  Now, Frank, go thou home to his house, 'Stead of his lawyer's, and bring his wife hither,  Who, just like to the lawyer's wife, is prison'd  With his[63] stern usurous jealousy, which could never  Be over-reach'd thus but with over-reaching.                    270                        _Re-enter_ SECURITY.  _Sec._ And, Master Francis, watch you th' instant time  To enter with his exit: 'twill be rare,  Two fine horn'd beasts!--a camel and a lawyer!  _Qu._ How the old villain joys in villainy!  _Sec._ And hark you, gossip, when you have her here,  Have your boat ready, ship her to your ship  With utmost haste, lest Master Bramble stay you.  To o'er-reach that head that out-reacheth all heads, 'Tis a trick rampant!--'tis a very quiblin![64]  I hope this harvest to pitch cart with lawyers,                 280  Their heads will be so forked. This sly touch  Will get apes to invent a number such.                                                             [_Exit._  _Qu._ Was ever rascal honey'd so with poison?  He that delights in slavish avarice,  Is apt to joy in every sort of vice.  Well, I'll go fetch his wife, whilst he the lawyer's.  _Pe._ But stay, Frank, let's think how we may disguise  her upon this sudden.                                           288  _Qu._ God's me! there's the mischief! But hark you,  here's an excellent device: 'fore God, a rare one! I will  carry her a sailor's gown and cap, and cover her, and a  player's beard.  _Pe._ And what upon her head?  _Qu._ I tell you, a sailor's cap! 'Slight, God forgive  me! what kind of figent[65] memory have you?  _Pe._ Nay, then, what kind of figent wit hast thou?  A sailor's cap?--how shall she put it off  When thou present'st her to our company?  _Qu._ Tush, man, for that, make her a saucy sailor.             299  _Pe._ Tush, tush!

You talk of disguising?  _Pe._ Ay, marry, gossip, that's our present care.  _Sec._ Cast care away then; here's the best device  For plain Security (for I am no better)  I think, that ever lived: here's my wife's gown,  Which you may put upon the lawyer's wife,                       310  And which I brought you, sir, for two great reasons;  One is, that Master Bramble may take hold  Of some suspicion that it is my wife,  And gird me so perhaps with his law-wit;  The other (which is policy indeed)  Is, that my wife may now be tied at home,  Having no more but her old gown abroad,  And not show me a quirk, while I firk others.  Is not this rare?  _Ambo._ The best that ever was.  _Sec._ Am I not born to furnish gentlemen?                      320  _Pe._ O my dear gossip!  _Sec._ Well hold, Master Francis; watch when the  lawyer's out, and put it in. And now I will go fetch  him.                                                             [_Exit._  _Qu._ O my dad! he goes as 'twere the devil to fetch  the lawyer; and devil shall he be, if horns will make  him.  _Pe._ Why, how now, gossip? why stay you there  musing?  _Sec._ A toy, a toy runs in my head, i'faith.                   330  _Qu._ A pox of that head! is there more toys yet?  _Pe._ What is it, pray thee, gossip?  _Sec._ Why, sir, what if you should slip away now with  my wife's best gown, I having no security for it?  _Qu._ For that I hope, dad, you will take our words.  _Sec._ Ay, by th' mass, your word--that's a proper staff  For wise Security to lean upon!  But 'tis no matter, once I'll trust my name  On your crack'd credits; let it take no shame.  Fetch the wench, Frank.                                                             [_Exit._  _Qu._ I'll wait upon you, sir,                                  340  And fetch you over, you were ne'er so fetch'd.  Go to the tavern, knight; your followers  Dare not be drunk, I think, before their captain.                                                             [_Exit._  _Pe._ Would I might lead them to no hotter service  Till our Virginian gold were in our purses!                                                             [_Exit._     [55] One of many allusions that show the early popularity of     Shakespeare's play.     [56] "Blue coat"--the livery of a serving-man.     [57] Ulcerous swelling.     [58] A variation of the snatch sung by Ophelia.     [59] The herb of remembrance, used at weddings and funerals.     [60] "With a wanion,"--with a plague!     [61] A misquotation from a song in John Dowland's _First Book     of Songs or Airs_ (1597):--         "Now, O now, I needs must part,          Parting though I absent mourn," &c.     [62] Sir Francis Drake's ship, in which he sailed round the     world.

Why, man,  all their dripping-pans and their chamber-pots are pure  gold; and all the chains with which they chain up their  streets are massy gold; all the prisoners they take are  fettered in gold; and for rubies and diamonds, they go  forth on holidays and gather 'hem by the seashore, to  hang on their children's coats, and stick in their caps,  as commonly as our children wear saffron-gilt brooches  and groats with holes in 'hem.                                   36  _Sca._ And is it a pleasant country withal?  _Sea._ As ever the sun shined on; temperate and full  of all sorts of excellent viands: wild boar is as common  there as our tamest bacon is here; venison as mutton.  And then you shall live freely there, without sergeants,  or courtiers, or lawyers, or intelligencers, only[67] a few  industrious Scots, perhaps, who indeed are dispersed  over the face of the whole earth. But as for them, there  are no greater friends to Englishmen and England,  when they are out on't, in the world, than they are.  And for my part, I would a hundred thousand of 'hem  were there, for we are all one countrymen now, ye  know, and we should find ten times more comfort of  them there than we do here. Then for your means to  advancement, there it is simple, and not preposterously  mixed. You may be an alderman there, and never be  scavenger: you may be a nobleman, and never be a  slave. You may come to preferment enough, and never  be a pander; to riches and fortune enough, and have  never the more villainy nor the less wit. Besides,[68] there  we shall have no more law than conscience, and not too  much of either; serve God enough, eat and drink enough,  and enough is as good as a feast.                                59  _Sp._ God's me! and how far is it thither?  _Sea._ Some six weeks' sail, no more, with any indifferent  good wind. And if I get to any part of the  coast of Africa, I'll sail thither with any wind; or when  I come to Cape Finisterre, there's a foreright wind  continually wafts us till we come at Virginia. See, our  colonel's come.                                                  66             _Enter_ Sir PETRONEL _with his followers_.  _Pe._ Well met, good Captain Seagull, and my noble  gentlemen! Now the sweet hour of our freedom is at  hand. Come, drawer, fill us some carouses, and prepare  us for the mirth that will be occasioned presently. Here  will be a pretty wench, gentlemen, that will bear us  company all our voyage.  _Sea._ Whatsoever she be, here's to her health, noble  colonel, both with cap and knee.  _Pe._ Thanks, kind Captain Seagull, she's one I love  dearly, and must not be known till we be free from  all that know us. And so, gentlemen, here's to her  health.                                                          78  _Ambo._ Let it come, worthy colonel; we do hunger  and thirst for it.  _Pe._ Afore heaven! you have hit the phrase of one  that her presence will touch from the foot to the forehead,  if ye knew it.  _Sp._ Why, then, we will join his forehead with her  health, sir; and Captain Scapethrift, here's to 'hem  both.                  _Enter_ SECURITY _and_ BRAMBLE.  _Sec._ See, see, Master Bramble, 'fore heaven! their  voyage cannot but prosper; they are o' their knees  for success to it!  _Br._ And they pray to god Bacchus.                              90  _Sec._ God save my brave colonel, with all his tall  captains and corporals. See, sir, my worshipful learned  counsel, Master Bramble, is come to take his leave of  you.  _Pe._ Worshipful Master Bramble, how far do you draw  us into the sweet-briar of your kindness! Come, Captain  Seagull, another health to this rare Bramble, that hath  never a prick about him.  _Sea._ I pledge his most smooth disposition, sir. Come,  Master Security, bend your supporters, and pledge this  notorious health here.                                          101  _Sec._ Bend you yours likewise, Master Bramble; for it  is you shall pledge me.  _Sea._ Not so, Master Security; he must not pledge his  own health.  _Sec._ No, Master Captain?           _Enter_ QUICKSILVER _with_ WINNY _disguised_.  Why, then, here's one is fitly come to do him that  honour.  _Qu._ Here's the gentlewoman your cousin, sir, whom,  with much entreaty, I have brought to take her leave of  you in a tavern; ashamed whereof, you must pardon  her if she put not off her mask.                                112  _Pe._ Pardon me, sweet cousin; my kind desire to see  you before I went, made me so importunate to entreat  your presence here.  _Sec._ How now, Master Francis? have you honoured  this presence with a fair gentlewoman?  _Qu._ Pray, sir, take you no notice of her, for she will  not be known to you.  _Sec._ But my learned counsel, Master Bramble here,  I hope he may know her.                                         121  _Qu._ No more than you, sir, at this time; his learning  must pardon her.  _Sec._ Well, God pardon her for my part, and I do, I'll  be sworn; and so, Master Francis, here's to all that are  going eastward to-night towards Cuckold's Haven;[69] and  so to the health of Master Bramble.  _Qu._ I pledge it, sir. Hath it gone round, Captain?  _Sea._ It has, sweet Frank; and the round closes with  thee.                                                           130  _Qu._ Well, sir, here's to all eastward and toward  cuckolds, and so to famous Cuckold's Haven, so fatally  remembered.                                                           [_Surgit._  _Pe._ Nay, pray thee, coz, weep not; gossip Security.  _Sec._ Ay, my brave gossip.  _Pe._ A word, I beseech you, sir. Our friend, Mistress  Bramble here, is so dissolved in tears, that she drowns  the whole mirth of our meeting. Sweet gossip, take  her aside and comfort her.                                      139  _Sec._ Pity of all true love, Mistress Bramble; what,  weep you to enjoy your love? What's the cause, lady?  Is't because your husband is so near, and your heart  yearns to have a little abused him? Alas, alas! the  offence is too common to be respected. So great a  grace hath seldom chanced to so unthankful a woman,  to be rid of an old jealous dotard, to enjoy the arms of  a loving young knight, that when your prickless Bramble  is withered with grief of your loss, will make you flourish  afresh in the bed of a lady.                                    149                          _Enter_ Drawer.  _Dr._ Sir Petronel, here's one of your watermen come  to tell you it will be flood these three hours; and that  'twill be dangerous going against the tide, for the sky  is overcast, and there was a porcpisce[70] even now seen  at London Bridge, which is always the messenger of  tempests, he says.  _Pe._ A porcpisce!--what's that to th' purpose? Charge  him, if he love his life, to attend us; can we not reach  Blackwall (where my ship lies) against the tide, and in  spite of tempests? Captains and gentlemen, we'll begin  a new ceremony at the beginning of our voyage, which  I believe will be followed of all future adventurers.           161  _Sea._ What's that, good colonel?  _Pe._ This, Captain Seagull. We'll have our provided  supper brought aboard Sir Francis Drake's ship,[71] that  hath compassed the world; where, with full cups and  banquets, we will do sacrifice for a prosperous voyage.  My mind gives me that some good spirits of the waters  should haunt the desert ribs of her, and be auspicious  to all that honour her memory, and will with like orgies  enter their voyages.                                            170  _Sea._ Rarely conceited! One health more to this  motion, and aboard to perform it. He that will not this  night be drunk, may he never be sober.                              [_They compass in_ WINIFRED, _dance the                                  drunken round, and drink carouses_.  _Br._ Sir Petronel and his honourable captains, in  these young services we old servitors may be spared.  We only came to take our leaves, and with one health  to you all, I'll be bold to do so. Here, neighbour  Security, to the health of Sir Petronel, and all his  captains.  _Sec._ You must bend then, Master Bramble; so now  I am for you. I have one corner of my brain, I hope,  fit to bear one carouse more. Here, lady, to you that  are encompassed there, and are ashamed of our company.  Ha, ha, ha! by my troth, my learned counsel,  Master Bramble, my mind runs so of Cuckold's Haven  to-night, that my head runs over with admiration.               186  _Br._ But is not that your wife, neighbour?  _Sec._ No, by my troth, Master Bramble. Ha, ha, ha!  A pox of all Cuckold's Havens, I say!  _Br._ O' my faith, her garments are exceeding like  your wife's.  _Sec._ _Cucullus non facit monachum_, my learned counsel;  all are not cuckolds that seem so, nor all seem not that  are so. Give me your hand, my learned counsel; you  and I will sup somewhere else than at Sir Francis  Drake's ship to-night. Adieu, my noble gossip.  _Br._ Good fortune, brave captains; fair skies God  send ye!  _Omnes._ Farewell, my hearts, farewell!                         199  _Pe._ Gossip, laugh no more at Cuckold's Haven, gossip.  _Sec._ I have done, I have done, sir; will you lead,  Master Bramble? Ha, ha, ha!  _Pe._ Captain Seagull, charge a boat.  _Omnes._ A boat, a boat, a boat!                                            [_Exeunt all but_ Drawer.  _Dr._ Y'are in a proper taking indeed, to take a boat,  especially at this time of night, and against tide and  tempest. They say yet, "drunken men never take  harm." This night will try the truth of that proverb.           208                                                             [_Exit._     [66] This date is too early.

For my part, I  presume not to arrive here, but in my masters behalf (a  poor butcher of East-cheap), who sends me to set up (in  honour of Saint Luke) these necessary ensigns of his  homage.[73] And up I got this morning, thus early, to get  up to the top of this famous tree, that is all fruit and no  leaves, to advance this crest of my master's occupation.  Up then; heaven and Saint Luke bless me, that I be  not blown into the Thames as I climb, with this furious  tempest. 'Slight! I think the devil be abroad, in likeness  of a storm, to rob me of my horns! Hark how he  roars! Lord! what a coil the Thames keeps! she bears  some unjust burthen, I believe, that she kicks and  curvets thus to cast it. Heaven bless all honest passengers  that are upon her back now; for the bit is out  of her mouth, I see, and she will run away with 'hem!  So, so, I think I have made it look the right way; it  runs against London Bridge, as it were, even full butt.  And now let me discover from this lofty prospect, what  pranks the rude Thames plays in her desperate lunacy.  O me! here's a boat has been cast away hard by. Alas,  alas! see one of her passengers labouring for his life to  land at this haven here! pray heaven he may recover  it! His next land is even just under me; hold out yet  a little, whatsoever thou art; pray, and take a good  heart to thee. 'Tis a man; take a man's heart to thee;  yet a little further, get up a' thy legs, man; now 'tis  shallow enough. So, so, so! Alas! he's down again.  Hold thy wind, father: 'tis a man in a nightcap. So!  now he's got up again; now he's past the worst: yet,  thanks be to heaven, he comes towards me pretty and  strongly.                                                        33         _Enter_ SECURITY _without his hat, in a nightcap,                           wet band, &c._  _Sec._ Heaven, I beseech thee, how have I offended  thee! where am I cast ashore now, that I may go a  righter way home by land? Let me see; O I am  scarce able to look about me: where is there any seamark  that I am acquainted withal?  _Sl._ Look up, father; are you acquainted with this  mark?                                                            40  _Sec._ What! landed at Cuckold's Haven! Hell and  damnation!

If it had not been  to die twenty times alive, I should never have 'scaped  death! I will never arise more; I will grovel here and  eat dirt till I be choked; I will make the gentle earth  do that, which the cruel water has denied me.                    49  _Sl._ Alas! good father, be not so desperate! Rise,  man; if you will I'll come presently and lead you home.  _Sec._ Home! shall I make any know my home, that  has known me thus abroad? How low shall I crouch  away, that no eye may see me? I will creep on the  earth while I live, and never look heaven in the face  more.                                                    [_Exit creeping._  _Sl._ What young planet reigns now, trow,[74] that old  men are so foolish? What desperate young swaggerer  would have been abroad such a weather as this, upon  the water? Ay me! see another remnant of this unfortunate  shipwreck, or some other. A woman, i'faith,  a woman; though it be almost at St. Katherine's, I discern  it to be a woman, for all her body is above the  water, and her clothes swim about her most handsomely.  O, they bear her up most bravely! has not a woman  reason to love the taking up of her clothes the better  while she lives, for this? Alas! how busy the rude  Thames is about her! a pox o' that wave! it will drown  her, i'faith, 'twill drown her! Cry God mercy, she has  'scaped it--I thank heaven she has 'scaped it! O how  she swims like a mermaid! some vigilant body look out  and save her. That's well said; just where the priest  fell in, there's one sets down a ladder, and goes to take  her up. God's blessing o' thy heart, boy! Now take  her up in thy arms and to bed with her; she's up, she's  up! She's a beautiful woman, I warrant her; the  billows durst not devour her.                                    77    _Enter the_ Drawer _of the Blue Anchor,_[75] _with_ WINIFRED.  _Dr._ How fare you now, lady?  _Wi._ Much better, my good friend, than I wish; as  one desperate of her fame, now my life is preserved.  _Dr._ Comfort yourself: that power that preserved you  from death can likewise defend you from infamy, howsoever  you deserve it. Were not you one that took  boat late this night, with a knight and other gentlemen  at Billingsgate?  _Wi._ Unhappy that I am, I was.                                  86  _Dr._ I am glad it was my good hap to come down  thus far after you, to a house of my friend's here in St.  Katherine's, since I am now happily made a mean to  your rescue from the ruthless tempest, which (when you  took boat) was so extreme, and the gentleman that  brought you forth so desperate and unsober, that I  feared long ere this I should hear of your shipwreck,  and therefore (with little other reason) made thus far  this way. And this I must tell you, since perhaps you  may make use of it, there was left behind you at our  tavern, brought by a porter (hired by the young gentleman  that brought you), a gentlewoman's gown, hat,  stockings, and shoes; which if they be yours, and you  please to shift you, taking a hard bed here in this house  of my friend, I will presently go fetch you.                    101  _Wi._ Thanks, my good friend, for your more than good  news. The gown with all things bound with it are mine;  which if you please to fetch as you have promised, I will  boldly receive the kind favour you have offered till your  return; entreating you, by all the good you have done in  preserving me hitherto, to let none take knowledge of what  favour you do me, or where such a one as I am bestowed,  lest you incur me much more damage in my fame than  you have done me pleasure in preserving my life.                110  _Dr._ Come in, lady, and shift yourself; resolve that  nothing but your own pleasure shall be used in your  discovery.  _Wi._ Thank you, good friend; the time may come, I  shall requite you.                                                           [_Exeunt._  _Slit._ See, see, see! I hold my life, there's some other  a taking up at Wapping now! Look, what a sort of  people cluster about the gallows there! in good troth  it is so. O me! a fine young gentleman! What, and  taken up at the gallows! Heaven grant he be not one  day taken down there! O' my life, it is ominous! Well,  he is delivered for the time. I see the people have all left  him; yet will I keep my prospect awhile, to see if any  more have been shipwracked.                                     124                 _Enter_ QUICKSILVER, _bareheaded_.  _Qu._ Accursed that ever I was saved or born!  How fatal is my sad arrival here!  As if the stars and providence spake to me,  And said, "The drift of all unlawful courses  (Whatever end they dare propose themselves,  In frame of their licentious policies),                         130  In the firm order of just destiny,  They are the ready highways to our ruins."  I know not what to do; my wicked hopes  Are, with this tempest, torn up by the roots.  O! which way shall I bend my desperate steps,  In which unsufferable shame and misery  Will not attend them? I will walk this bank,  And see if I can meet the other relics  Of our poor shipwreck'd crew, or hear of them.  The knight, alas! was so far gone with wine,                    140  And th' other three, that I refused their boat,  And took the hapless woman in another,  Who cannot but be sunk, whatever fortune  Hath wrought upon the others' desperate lives.                                                             [_Exit._          _Enter_ Sir PETRONEL _and_ SEAGULL, _bareheaded_.  _Pe._ Zounds! captain, I will tell thee, we are cast up  o' the coast of France. 'Sfoot! I am not drunk still, I  hope. Dost remember where we were last night?  _Sea._ No, by my troth, knight, not I; but methinks we  have been a horrible while upon the water and in the  water.                                                          150  _Pe._ Ay me! we are undone for ever! Hast any  money about thee?  _Sea._ Not a penny, by Heaven!  _Pe._ Not a penny betwixt us, and cast ashore in  France!  _Sea._ 'Faith, I cannot tell that; my brains nor mine  eyes are not mine own yet.                                      157                       _Enter two_ Gentlemen.  _Pe._ 'Sfoot! wilt not believe me? I know't by th'  elevation of the pole, and by the altitude and latitude of  the climate. See, here comes a couple of French gentlemen;  I knew we were in France; dost thou think our  Englishmen are so Frenchified, that a man knows not  whether he be in France or in England, when he sees  'hem? What shall we do? We must e'en to 'hem, and  entreat some relief of 'hem. Life is sweet, and we have  no other means to relieve our lives now but their charities.  _Sea._ Pray you, do you beg on 'hem then; you can  speak French.                                                   168  _Pe._ Monsieur, plaist il d'avoir pitie de nostre grande  infortune. Je suis un poure chevalier d'Angleterre qui  a souffri l'infortune de naufrage.  _1st Gent._ Un poure chevalier d'Angleterre?  _Pe._ Oui, monsieur, il est trop vray; mais vous saves  bien nous sommes toutes subject  fortune.  _2nd Gent._ A poor knight of England?--a poor knight  of Windsor, are you not? Why speak you this broken  French when y'are a whole Englishman? On what coast  are you, think you?  _Pe._ On the coast of France, sir.                              179  _1st Gent._ On the coast of Dogs, sir; y'are i'th' Isle o'  Dogs, I tell you, I see y'ave been washed in the Thames  here, and I believe ye were drowned in a tavern before,  or else you would never have took boat in such a dawning  as this was. Farewell, farewell; we will not know you  for shaming of you. I ken the man weel; he's one of  my thirty pound knights.[76]  _2nd Gent._ No, no, this is he that stole his knighthood  o' the grand day for four pound given to a page; all the  money in's purse, I wot well.                                                           [_Exeunt._  _Sea._ Death! colonel, I knew you were over-shot.               190  _Pe._ Sure I think now, indeed, Captain Seagull, we  were something over-shot.                        _Enter_ QUICKSILVER.  What! my sweet Frank Quicksilver! dost thou survive  to rejoice me? But what! nobody at thy heels, Frank?  Ay me! what is become of poor Mistress Security?  _Qu._ 'Faith, gone quite from her name, as she is from  her fame, I think; I left her to the mercy of the water.  _Sea._ Let her go, let her go! Let us go to our ship at  Blackwall, and shift us.                                        199  _Pe._ Nay, by my troth, let our clothes rot upon us, and  let us rot in them; twenty to one our ship is attached  by this time! If we set her not under sail this last tide,  I never looked for any other. Woe, woe is me! what  shall become of us? The last money we could make,  the greedy Thames has devoured; and if our ship be  attached, there is no hope can relieve us.  _Qu._ 'Sfoot! knight, what an unknightly faintness transports  thee! Let our ship sink, and all the world that's  without us be taken from us, I hope I have some tricks  in this brain of mine shall not let us perish.                  210  _Sea._ Well said, Frank, i'faith. O, my nimble-spirited  Quicksilver! 'Fore God! would thou hadst been our  colonel!  _Pe._ I like his spirit rarely; but I see no means he  has to support that spirit.  _Qu._ Go to, knight! I have more means than thou art  aware of. I have not lived amongst goldsmiths and  goldmakers all this while, but I have learned something  worthy of my time with 'hem. And not to let thee stink  where thou stand'st, knight, I'll let thee know some of  my skill presently.                                             221  _Sea._ Do, good Frank, I beseech thee.  _Qu._ I will blanch copper so cunningly that it shall  endure all proofs but the test: it shall endure malleation,  it shall have the ponderosity of Luna, and the tenacity  of Luna--by no means friable.  _Pe._ 'Slight! where learn'st thou these terms, trow?  _Qu._ Tush, knight! the terms of this art every ignorant  quacksalver is perfect in; but I'll tell you how yourself  shall blanch copper thus cunningly. Take arsenic, otherwise  called realga (which indeed is plain ratsbane); sublime  'hem three or four times, then take the sublimate  of this realga, and put 'hem into a glass, into chymia,  and let them have a convenient decoction natural, four-and-twenty  hours, and he will become perfectly fixed;  then take this fixed powder, and project him upon well-purged  copper, _et habebis magisterium_.                               237  _Ambo._ Excellent Frank, let us hug thee!  _Qu._ Nay, this I will do besides. I'll take you off  twelvepence from every angel, with a kind of aquafortis,  and never deface any part of the image.  _Pe._ But then it will want weight?  _Qu._ You shall restore that thus: Take your sal achime  prepared, and your distilled urine, and let your angels lie  in it but four-and-twenty hours, and they shall have their  perfect weight again. Come on, now; I hold this is  enough to put some spirit into the livers of you; I'll  infuse more another time. We have saluted the proud  air long enough with our bare sconces. Now will I have  you to a wench's house of mine at London, there make  shift to shift us, and after, take such fortunes as the stars  shall assign us.                                                252  _Ambo._ Notable Frank, we will ever adore thee!                                                           [_Exeunt._           _Enter_ Drawer, _with_ WINIFRED _new-attired_.  _Wi._ Now, sweet friend, you have brought me near  enough your tavern, which I desired I might with some  colour be seen near, inquiring for my husband, who, I  must tell you, stole[77] thither the last night with my wet  gown we have left at your friend's, which, to continue  your former honest kindness, let me pray you to keep  close from the knowledge of any: and so, with all vow  of your requital, let me now entreat you to leave me to  my woman's wit and fortune.                                     262  _Dr._ All shall be done you desire; and so all the fortune  you can wish for attend you.                                                      [_Exit_ Drawer.                         _Enter_ SECURITY.  _Sec._ I will once more to this unhappy tavern before I  shift one rag of me more; that I may there know what  is left behind, and what news of their passengers. I have  bought me a hat and band with the little money I had  about me, and made the streets a little leave staring at  my nightcap.  _Wi._ O, my dear husband! where have you been  to-night? All night abroad at taverns! Rob me of  my garments! and fare as one run away from me!  Alas! is this seemly for a man of your credit, of your  age, and affection to your wife?                                275  _Sec._ What should I say?--how miraculously sorts  this!--was not I at home, and called thee last night?  _Wi._ Yes, sir, the harmless sleep you broke; and my  answer to you would have witnessed it, if you had had  the patience to have stayed and answered me; but your  so sudden retreat made me imagine you were gone to  Master Bramble's, and so rested patient and hopeful  of your coming again, till this your unbelieved absence  brought me abroad with no less than wonder, to seek  you where the false knight had carried you.                     285  _Sec._ Villain and monster that I was! how have I  abused thee! I was suddenly gone indeed; for my sudden  jealousy transferred me. I will say no more but this:  dear wife, I suspected thee.  _Wi._ Did you suspect me?                                       290  _Sec._ Talk not of it, I beseech thee; I am ashamed to  imagine it. I will home, I will home; and every morning  on my knees ask thee heartily forgiveness.                                                           [_Exeunt._  [_Slit._] Now will I descend my honourable prospect;  the farthest seeing sea-mark of the world; no marvel,  then, if I could see two miles about me. I hope the  red tempest's anger be now over-blown, which sure, I  think, Heaven sent as a punishment for profaning holy  Saint Luke's memory[78] with so ridiculous a custom.  Thou dishonest satire! farewell to honest married  men, farewell to all sorts and degrees of thee! Farewell,  thou horn of hunger, that call'st the inns o' court to  their manger! Farewell, thou horn of abundance, that  adornest the headsmen of the commonwealth! Farewell,  thou horn of direction, that is the city lanthorn!  Farewell, thou horn of pleasure, the ensign of the huntsman!  Farewell, thou horn of destiny, th' ensign of the  married man!

Do we not know nor-north-east,  north-east-and-by-east, east-and-by-north? nor plain eastward?  Ha! have we never heard of Virginia? nor the  Cavallaria? nor the Colonoria? Can we discover no discoveries?  Well, mine errant Sir Flash, and my runagate  Quicksilver, you may drink drunk,[79] crack cans, hurl away  a brown dozen of Monmouth caps[80] or so, in sea ceremony  to your _bon voyage_; but for reaching any coast, save the  coast of Kent or Essex, with this tide, or with this fleet, I'll  be your warrant for a Gravesend toast. There's that gone  afore will stay your admiral,[81] and vice-admiral and rear-admiral,  were they all (as they are) but one pinnace,  and under sail, as well as a remora,[82] doubt it not; and  from this sconce,[83] without either powder or shot. Work  upon that now. Nay, and you'll show tricks, we'll vie[84]  with you a little. My daughter, his lady, was sent eastward  by land, to a castle of his, i' the air (in what region  I know not), and, as I hear, was glad to take up her  lodging in her coach, she and her two waiting-women, her  maid, and her mother, like three snails in a shell, and the  coachman a-top on 'hem, I think. Since they have all  found the way back again by Weeping Cross;[85] but I'll  not see 'hem. And for two on 'hem, madam and her  malkin, they are like to bite o' the bridle for William, as  the poor horses have done all this while that hurried  'hem, or else go graze o' the common. So should my  Dame Touchstone too; but she has been my cross these  thirty years, and I'll now keep her to fright away sprites,  i'faith. I wonder I hear no news of my son Golding.  He was sent for to the Guildhall this morning betimes,  and I marvel at the matter; if I had not laid up comfort  and hope in him, I should grow desperate of all.  See! he is come i' my thought. How now, son? What  news at the Court of Aldermen?                                   35                          _Enter_ GOLDING.  _Go._ Troth, sir, an accident somewhat strange, else it  hath little in it worth the reporting.  _To._ What? it is not borrowing of money, then?  _Go._ No, sir; it hath pleased the worshipful commoners  of the city to take me one i' their number at presentation  of the inquest----  _To._ Ha!  _Go._ And the alderman of the ward wherein I dwell to  appoint me his deputy----  _To._ How?                                                       45  _Go._ In which place I have had an oath administered  me, since I went.  _To._ Now, my dear and happy son, let me kiss thy  new worship, and a little boast mine own happiness in  thee. What a fortune was it (or rather my judgment,  indeed) for me, first to see that in his disposition which  a whole city so conspires to second! Ta'en into the  livery of his company the first day of his freedom! Now  (not a week married) chosen commoner and alderman's  deputy in a day! Note but the reward of a thrifty  course. The wonder of his time! Well, I will honour  Master Alderman for this act (as becomes me), and shall  think the better of the Common Council's wisdom and  worship while I live, for thus meeting, or but coming  after me, in the opinion of his desert. Forward, my  sufficient son! and as this is the first, so esteem it the  least step to that high and prime honour that expects thee.  _Go._ Sir, as I was not ambitious of this, so I covet no  higher place; it hath dignity enough, if it will but save  me from contempt; and I had rather my bearing in  this or any other office should add worth to it, than the  place give the least opinion to me.                              67  _To._ Excellently spoken! This modest answer of  thine blushes, as if it said, I will wear scarlet shortly.  Worshipful son! I cannot contain myself, I must tell  thee; I hope to see thee one o' the monuments of our  city, and reckoned among her worthies to be remembered  the same day with the Lady Ramsey[86]  and grave  Gresham, when the famous fable of Whittington and  his puss shall be forgotten, and thou and thy acts become  the posies for hospitals; when thy name shall be written  upon conduits, and thy deeds, played i' thy lifetime, by the  best companies of actors,[87] and be called their get-penny.[88]  This I divine. This I prophesy.                                  79  _Go._ Sir, engage not your expectation farther than my  abilities will answer; I, that know mine own strengths,  fear 'hem; and there is so seldom a loss in promising  the least, that commonly it brings with it a welcome  deceit. I have other news for you, sir.  _To._ None more welcome, I am sure?  _Go._ They have their degree of welcome, I dare affirm.  The colonel and all his company, this morning putting  forth drunk from Billingsgate, had like to have been cast  away o' this side Greenwich; and (as I have intelligence  by a false brother) are come dropping to town like so  many masterless men, i' their doublets and hose, without  hat, or cloak, or any other----                                  92  _To._ A miracle! the justice of Heaven! Where are  they? let's go presently and lay[89] for 'hem.  _Go._ I have done that already, sir, both by constables  and other officers, who shall take 'hem at their old  Anchor, and with less tumult or suspicion than if yourself  were seen in't--and under colour of a great press  that is now abroad, and they shall here be brought afore  me.                                                             100  _To._ Prudent and politic son! Disgrace 'hem all that  ever thou canst; their ship I have already arrested.  How to my wish it falls out, that thou hast the place of  a justicer upon 'hem! I am partly glad of the injury  done to me, that thou may'st punish it. Be severe i' thy  place, like a new officer o' the first quarter, unreflected.  You hear how our lady is come back with her train,  from the invisible castle?  _Go._ No; where is she?                                         109  _To._ Within; but I ha' not seen her yet, nor her  mother, who now begins to wish her daughter undubbed,  they say, and that she had walked a foot-pace with her  sister. Here they come; stand back.          _Enter_ MISTRESS TOUCHSTONE, GERTRUDE, MILDRED,                           _and_ SINDEFY.  God save your ladyship--save your good ladyship!  Your ladyship is welcome from your enchanted castle,  so are your beauteous retinue.  I hear your knight  errant is travelled on strange adventures. Surely, in my  mind, your ladyship hath fished fair, and caught a frog,  as the saying is.  _Mist. T._ Speak to your father, madam, and kneel  down.                                                           121  _Ge._ Kneel? I hope I am not brought so low yet;  though my knight be run away, and has sold my land, I  am a lady still.  _To._ Your ladyship says true, madam; and it is fitter  and a greater decorum, that I should curtsey to you that  are a knight's wife, and a lady, than you be brought o'  your knees to me, who am a poor cullion[90] and your  father.  _Ge._ Law!--my father knows his duty.                           130  _Mist. T._ O child!  _To._ And therefore I do desire your ladyship, my good  Lady Flash, in all humility, to depart my obscure cottage,  and return in quest of your bright and most transparent  castle, however presently concealed to mortal eyes. And  as for one poor woman of your train here, I will take that  order, she shall no longer be a charge unto you, nor help  to spend your ladyship; she shall stay at home with me,  and not go abroad, nor put you to the pawning of an  odd coach-horse or three wheels, but take part with the  Touchstone. If we lack, we will not complain to your  ladyship. And so, good madam, with your damosel  here, please you to let us see your straight backs in  equipage; for truly here is no roost for such chickens as  you are, or birds o' your feather, if it like your  ladyship.                                                       146  _Ge._ Marry, fist[91] o' your kindness! I thought as  much. Come away, Sin, we shall as soon get a fart  from a dead man,[92] as a farthing of courtesy here.  _Mi._ O, good sister!  _Ge._ Sister, sir reverence! Come away, I say, hunger  drops out at his nose.  _Go._ O, madam, fair words never hurt the tongue.  _Ge._ How say you by that? You come out with your  gold-ends now!  _Mist. T._ Stay, lady-daughter; good husband!                   156  _To._ Wife, no man loves his fetters, be they made of  gold. I list not ha' my head fastened under my child's  girdle; as she has brewed, so let her drink, o' God's  name. She went witless to wedding, now she may go  wisely a-begging. It's but honeymoon yet with her  ladyship; she has coach-horses, apparel, jewels, yet left;  she needs care for no friends, nor take knowledge of  father, mother, brother, sister, or anybody. When those  are pawned or spent, perhaps we shall return into the  list of her acquaintance.                                       166  _Ge._ I scorn it, i'faith. Come, Sin.  _Mist. T._ O madam, why do you provoke your father  thus?                                    [_Exeunt_ GERTRUDE _and_ SINDEFY.  _To._ Nay, nay; e'en let pride go afore, shame will  follow after, I warrant you. Come, why dost thou weep  now? Thou art not the first good cow hast had an ill  calf, I trust.                         _Enter_ Constable.  What's the news with that fellow?  _Go._ Sir, the knight and your man Quicksilver are  without; will you ha' 'hem brought in?  _To._ O, by any means. [_Exit Constable._] And, son,  here's a chair; appear terrible unto 'hem on the first  interview. Let them behold the melancholy of a magistrate,  and taste the fury of a citizen in office.                      180  _Go._ Why, sir, I can do nothing to 'hem, except you  charge 'hem with somewhat.  _To._ I will charge 'hem and recharge 'hem, rather than  authority should want foil to set it off.  _Go._ No, good sir, I will not.  _To._ Son, it is your place; by any means----  _Go._ Believe it, I will not, sir.       _Enter_ Sir PETRONEL, QUICKSILVER, Constable, Officers.  _Pe._ How misfortune pursues us still in our misery!  _Qu._ Would it had been my fortune to have been  trussed up at Wapping[93] rather than ever ha' come here!  _Pe._ Or mine, to have famished in the island!                  191  _Qu._ Must Golding sit upon us?  _Co._ You might carry an M. under your girdle[94] to  Master Deputy's worship.  _Go._ What are those, Master Constable?  _Co._ An't please your worship, a couple of masterless  men I pressed for the Low Countries, sir.  _Go._ Why do you not carry 'hem to Bridewell,  according to your order, they may be shipped away?  _Co._ An't please your worship, one of 'hem says he is  a knight; and we thought good to show him to your  worship, for our discharge.                                     202  _Go._ Which is he?  _Co._ This, sir.  _Go._ And what's the other?  _Co._ A knight's fellow, sir, an't please you.  _Go._ What! a knight and his fellow thus accoutred?  Where are their hats and feathers, their rapiers and their  cloaks?  _Qu._ O, they mock us.                                          210  _Co._ Nay, truly, sir, they had cast both their feathers  and hats too, before we see 'hem. Here's all their  furniture, an't please you, that we found. They say  knights are now to be known without feathers, like  cockerels by their spurs, sir.  _Go._ What are their names, say they?  _To._ Very well this. He should not take knowledge  of 'hem in his place, indeed.  _Co._ This is Sir Petronel Flash.  _To._ How!                                                      220  _Co._ And this, Francis Quicksilver.  _To._ Is't possible? I thought your worship had been  gone for Virginia, sir; you are welcome home, sir.  Your worship has made a quick return, it seems, and no  doubt a good voyage. Nay, pray you be covered, sir.  How did your biscuit hold out, sir? Methought I had  seen this gentleman afore--good Master Quicksilver!  How a degree to the southward has changed you!  _Go._ Do you know 'hem, father? Forbear your offers  a little, you shall be heard anon.                              230  _To._ Yes, Master Deputy; I had a small venture with  them in the voyage--a thing called a son-in-law, or so.  Officers, you may let 'hem stand alone, they will not run  away; I'll give my word for them. A couple of very  honest gentlemen. One of 'hem was my prentice, Master  Quicksilver here; and when he had two year to serve,  kept his whore and his hunting nag, would play his  hundred pound at gresco,[95] or primero, as familiarly (and  all o' my purse) as any bright piece of crimson on 'hem  all; had his changeable trunks of apparel standing at  livery with his mare, his chest of perfumed linen, and his  bathing-tubs, which when I told him of, why he!--he  was a gentleman, and I a poor Cheapside groom. The  remedy was, we must part. Since when, he hath had  the gift of gathering up some small parcels of mine, to[96]  the value of five hundred pound, dispersed among my  customers, to furnish this his Virginia venture; wherein  this knight was the chief, Sir Flash--one that married a  daughter of mine, ladyfied her, turned two thousand  pounds' worth of good land of hers into cash within the  first week, bought her a new gown and a coach; sent  her to seek her fortune by land, whilst himself prepared  for his fortune by sea; took in fresh flesh at Billingsgate,  for his own diet, to serve him the whole voyage--the  wife of a certain usurer called Security, who hath been  the broker for 'hem in all this business. Please, Master  Deputy, work upon that now.                                     257  _Go._ If my worshipful father have ended----  _To._ I have, it shall please Master Deputy.  _Go._ Well then, under correction----  _To._ Now, son, come over 'hem with some fine gird, as  thus, "Knight, you shall be encountered," that is, had  to the Counter; or, "Quicksilver, I will put you into a  crucible," or so.  _Go._ Sir Petronel Flash, I am sorry to see such flashes  as these proceed from a gentleman of your quality and  rank; for mine own part, I could wish I could say I  could not see them; but such is the misery of magistrates  and men in place, that they must not wink at offenders.  Take him aside; I will hear you anon, sir.                      270  _To._ I like this well, yet; there's some grace i' the  knight left--he cries.  _Go._ Francis Quicksilver, would God thou hadst turned  quacksalver, rather than run into these dissolute and  lewd courses! It is great pity; thou art a proper young  man, of an honest and clean face, somewhat near a good  one; God hath done his part in thee; but thou hast  made too much, and been too proud of that face, with  the rest of thy body; for maintenance of which in neat  and garish attire, only to be looked upon by some light  housewives, thou hast prodigally consumed much of thy  master's estate; and being by him gently admonished  at several times, hast returned thyself haughty and rebellious  in thine answers, thundering out uncivil comparisons,  requiting all his kindness with a coarse and  harsh behaviour; never returning thanks for any one  benefit, but receiving all as if they had been debts to  thee, and no courtesies. I must tell thee, Francis, these  are manifest signs of an ill-nature; and God doth often  punish such pride and _outrecuidance_[97] with scorn and  infamy, which is the worst of misfortune. My worshipful  father, what do you please to charge them withal? From  the press I will free 'hem, Master Constable.                   293  _Co._ Then I'll leave your worship, sir.  _Go._ No, you may stay; there will be other matters  against 'hem.  _To._ Sir, I do charge this gallant, Master Quicksilver,  on suspicion of felony; and the knight as being accessary  in the receipt of my goods.  _Qu._ O God, sir!                                               300  _To._ Hold thy peace, impudent varlet, hold thy peace!  With what forehead or face dost thou offer to chop logic  with me, having run such a race of riot as thou hast  done? Does not the sight of this worshipful man's  fortune and temper confound thee, that was thy younger  fellow in household, and now come to have the place of  a judge upon thee? Dost not observe this? Which of  all thy gallants and gamesters, thy swearers and thy swaggerers,  will come now to moan thy misfortune, or pity  thy penury? They'll look out at a window, as thou ridest  in triumph to Tyburn, and cry, "Yonder goes honest  Frank, mad Quicksilver!" "He was a free boon companion,  when he had money," says one; "Hang him,  fool!" says another; "he could not keep it when he had  it!" "A pox o' th' cullion, his master," says a third,  "he has brought him to this;" when their pox of pleasure,  and their piles of perdition, would have been better  bestowed upon thee, that hast ventured for 'hem with  the best, and by the clue of thy knavery brought thyself  weeping to the cart of calamity.                                320  _Qu._ Worshipful master!  _To._ Offer not to speak, crocodile; I will not hear a  sound come from thee. Thou hast learnt to whine at  the play yonder. Master Deputy, pray you commit 'hem  both to safe custody, till I be able farther to charge  'hem.  _Qu._ O me! what an infortunate thing am I!  _Pe._ Will you not take security, sir?  _To._ Yes, marry, will I, Sir Flash, if I can find him,  and charge him as deep as the best on you. He has  been the plotter of all this; he is your enginer,[98] I hear.  Master Deputy, you'll dispose of these. In the meantime,  I'll to my lord mayor, and get his warrant to seize  that serpent Security into my hands, and seal up both  house and goods to the king's use or my satisfaction.           335  _Go._ Officers, take 'hem to the Counter.  _Qu._ } O God!  _Pe._ }  _To._ Nay, on, on! you see the issue of your sloth. Of  sloth cometh pleasure, of pleasure cometh riot, of riot  comes whoring, of whoring comes spending, of spending  comes want, of want comes theft, of theft comes hanging;  and there is my Quicksilver fixed.                                                           [_Exeunt._     [79] "'Slid now, I'm quite altered! ... sit up late till it be     early; _drink drunk_ till I am sober."--Middleton, iii. 254.     [80] "Monmouth caps" were caps worn by sailors.

Canst  thou tell ne'er a one, Sin?  _Si._ None but mine own, madam, which is lamentable  enough: first to be stolen from my friends, which were  worshipful and of good accompt, by a prentice, in the  habit and disguise of a gentleman, and here brought up  to London, and promised marriage, and now likely to be  forsaken, for he is in possibility to be hanged!                 14  _Ge._ Nay, weep not, good Sin; my Petronel is in as  good possibility as he. Thy miseries are nothing to  mine, Sin; I was more than promised marriage, Sin; I  had it, Sin; and was made a lady; and by a knight,  Sin; which is now as good as no knight, Sin. And I  was born in London, which is more than brought up,  Sin; and already forsaken, which is past likelihood,  Sin; and instead of land i' the country, all my  knight's living lies i' the Counter, Sin; there's his  castle now!                                                      24  _Si._ Which he cannot be forced out of, madam.  _Ge._ Yes, if he would live hungry a week or two.  "Hunger," they say, "breaks stone walls." But he is  e'en well enough served, Sin, that so soon as ever he  had got my hand to the sale of my inheritance, run  away from me, and I had been his punk, God bless us!  Would the Knight o' the Sun,[100] or Palmerin of England,  have used their ladies so, Sin? or Sir Lancelot? or Sir  Tristram?  _Si._ I do not know, madam.                                      34  _Ge._ Then thou know'st nothing, Sin. Thou art a  fool, Sin. The knighthood nowadays are nothing like  the knighthood of old time. They rid a-horseback; ours  go a-foot. They were attended by their squires; ours  by their lackeys. They went buckled in their armour;  ours muffled in their cloaks. They travelled wildernesses  and deserts; ours dare scarce walk the streets. They  were still pressed to engage their honour; ours still  ready to pawn their clothes. They would gallop on at  sight of a monster; ours run away at sight of a sergeant.  They would help poor ladies; ours make poor ladies.  _Si._ Ay, madam, they were knights of the Round  Table at Winchester, that sought adventures; but these  of the Square Table at ordinaries, that sit at hazard.[101]      48  _Ge._ True,[102] Sin, let him vanish. And tell me, what  shall we pawn next?  _Si._ Ay, marry, madam, a timely consideration; for  our hostess (profane woman!) has sworn by bread and  salt she will not trust us another meal.  _Ge._ Let it stink in her hand then. I'll not be beholding  to her. Let me see, my jewels be gone, and my  gowns, and my red velvet petticoat that I was married  in, and my wedding silk stockings, and all thy best  apparel, poor Sin! Good faith, rather than thou  shouldst pawn a rag more, I'd lay my ladyship in  lavender[103]--if I knew where.                                  60  _Si._ Alas, madam, your ladyship!  _Ge._ Ay,--why?--you do not scorn my ladyship,  though it is in a waistcoat? God's my life! you are a  peat[104] indeed! Do I offer to mortgage my ladyship for  you and for your avail, and do you turn the lip and the  alas to my ladyship?  _Si._ No, madam; but I make question who will lend  anything upon it?                                                68  _Ge._ Who?--marry, enow, I warrant you, if you'll seek  'hem out. I'm sure I remember the time when I would  ha' given one thousand pounds (if I had had it) to have  been a lady; and I hope I was not bred and born with  that appetite alone: some other gentle-born o' the city  have the same longing, I trust. And for my part, I  would afford 'hem a penn'orth; my ladyship is little the  worse for the wearing, and yet I would bate a good  deal of the sum. I would lend it (let me see) for forty  pound in hand, Sin; that would apparel us; and ten  pound a year, that would keep me and you, Sin (with  our needles); and we should never need to be beholding  to our scurvy parents. Good Lord! that there are  no fairies nowadays, Sin!                                        82  _Si._ Why, madam?  _Ge._ To do miracles, and bring ladies money. Sure,  if we lay in a cleanly house, they would haunt it, Sin.  I'll try. I'll sweep the chamber soon at night, and set  a dish of water o' the hearth. A fairy may come, and  bring a pearl or a diamond. We do not know, Sin.  Or, there may be a pot of gold hid o' the backside,[105] if  we had tools to dig for't? Why may not we two rise  early i' the morning, Sin, afore anybody is up, and find  a jewel i' the streets worth a hundred pound? May not  some great court-lady, as she comes from revels at midnight,  look out of her coach as 'tis running, and lose  such a jewel, and we find it? Ha?                                95  _Si._ They are pretty waking dreams, these.  _Ge._ Or may not some old usurer be drunk overnight,  with a bag of money, and leave it behind him on a stall?  For God's sake, Sin, let's rise to-morrow by break of  day, and see. I protest, law, if I had as much money  as an alderman, I would scatter some on't i' th' streets  for poor ladies to find, when their knights were laid up.  And, now I remember my song o' the Golden Shower,  why may not I have such a fortune? I'll sing it, and  try what luck I shall have after it.                            105       "Fond fables tell of old,          How Jove in Dane's lap        Fell in a shower of gold,          By which she caught a clap;          O had it been my hap                                    110       (How ere the blow doth threaten),          So well I like the play,          That I could wish all day        And night to be so beaten."                    _Enter_ Mistress TOUCHSTONE.  O here's my mother! good luck, I hope. Ha' you  brought any money, mother? Pray you, mother, your  blessing. Nay, sweet mother, do not weep.  _Mist. T._ God bless you! I would I were in my  grave!                                                          119  _Ge._ Nay, dear mother, can you steal no more money  from my father? Dry your eyes, and comfort me.  Alas! it is my knight's fault, and not mine, that I am  in a waistcoat, and attired thus simply.  _Mist. T._ Simply, 'tis better than thou deservest.  Never whimper for the matter. Thou shouldst have  looked before thou hadst leapt. Thou wert afire to be  a lady, and now your ladyship and you may both blow  at the coal, for aught I know. Self do, self have. The  hasty person never wants woe, they say.                         129  _Ge._ Nay, then, mother, you should ha' looked to it.  A body would think you were the older; I did but my  kind, I. He was a knight, and I was fit to be a lady.  'Tis not lack of liking, but lack of living, that severs us.  And you talk like yourself and a cittiner in this, i'faith.  You show what husband you come on, I wis. You  smell the Touchstone--he that will do more for his  daughter, that he has married [to] a scurvy gold-end man[106]  and his prentice, than he will for his t'other daughter,  that has wedded a knight and his customer. By this  light, I think he is not my legitimate father.                  140  _Si._ O, good madam, do not take up your mother so!  _Mist. T._ Nay, nay, let her e'en alone. Let her ladyship  grieve me still, with her bitter taunts and terms. I  have not dole enough to see her in this miserable case,  I--without her velvet gowns, without ribands, without  jewels, without French-wires, or cheat-bread,[107] or quails,  or a little dog, or a gentleman-usher, or anything, indeed,  that's fit for a lady----  _Si._ Except her tongue.                                        149  _Mist. T._ And I not able to relieve her, neither, being  kept so short by my husband. Well, God knows my  heart; I did little think that ever she should have had  need of her sister Golding.  _Ge._ Why, mother, I ha' not yet. Alas! good mother,  be not intoxicate for me; I am well enough; I would  not change husbands with my sister, I. The[108] leg of a  lark is better than the body of a kite.  _Mist. T._ I know that: but----  _Ge._ What, sweet mother, what?  _Mist. T._ It's but ill food when nothing's left but the  claw.                                                           161  _Ge._ That's true, mother. Ay me!  _Mist. T._ Nay, sweet lady-bird,[109] sigh not. Child,  madam--why do you weep thus? Be of good cheer; I  shall die if you cry, and mar your complexion thus.  _Ge._ Alas, mother, what should I do?  _Mist. T._ Go to thy sister's, child; she'll be proud thy    ladyship will come under her roof. She'll win thy  father to release thy knight, and redeem thy gowns, and  thy coach and thy horses, and set thee up again.                170  _Ge._ But will she get him to set my knight up too?  _Mist. T._ That she will, or anything else thou'lt ask  her.  _Ge._ I will begin to love her if I thought she would do  this.  _Mist. T._ Try her, good chuck,[110] I warrant thee.  _Ge._ Dost thou think she'll do't?  _Si._ Ay, madam, and be glad you will receive it.  _Mist.

He remarks:--"Certainly Hazard is the most bewitching game     that is played on the dice, for when a man begins to play he     knows not when to leave off; and having once accustomed himself     to play at Hazard, he hardly ever after minds anything else."     [102] Old ed.

Return with your packet, sir.  _Wo._ Believe it, sir, you need fear no packing here;  these are but letters of submission all.  _To._ Sir, I do look for no submission. I will bear  myself in this like blind Justice. Work upon that now.  When the sessions come they shall hear from me.                  12  _Go._ From whom come your letters, Master Wolf?  _Wo._ And't please you, sir, one from Sir Petronel,  another from Francis Quicksilver, and a third from old  Security, who is almost mad in prison. There are two  to your worship; one from Master Francis, sir, another  from the knight.  _To._ I do wonder, Master Wolf, why you should travail  thus, in a business so contrary to kind, or the nature o'  your place: that you, being the keeper of a prison,  should labour the release of your prisoners; whereas,  methinks, it were far more natural and kindly in you to  be ranging about for more, and not let these 'scape you  have already under the tooth. But they say you Wolves,  when you ha' sucked the blood, once that they are dry,  you ha' done.                                                    27  _Wo._ Sir, your worship may descant as you please o'  my name; but I protest I was never so mortified with  any men's discourse or behaviour in prison; yet I have  had of all sorts of men i' the kingdom under my  keys; and almost of all religions i' the land, as  Papist, Protestant, Puritan, Brownist, Anabaptist, Millenary,  Family-o'-Love, Jew, Turk, Infidel, Atheist, Good-Fellow,  &c.  _Go._ And which of all these, thinks Master Wolf, was  the best religion?                                               37  _Wo._ Troth, Master Deputy, they that pay fees best:  we never examine their consciences farther.  _Go._ I believe you, Master Wolf. Good faith, sir,  here's a great deal of humility i' these letters.  _Wo._ Humility, sir? Ay, were your worship an eyewitness  of it you would say so. The knight will i' the  Knight's Ward,[111] do what we can, sir; and Master Quicksilver  would be i' the Hole if we would let him. I never  knew or saw prisoners more penitent, or more devout.  They will sit you up all night singing of psalms and  edifying the whole prison; only Security sings a note  too high sometimes, because he lies i' the Twopenny  Ward, far off, and cannot take his tune. The neighbours  cannot rest for him, but come every morning to ask  what godly prisoners we have.                                    52  _To._ Which on 'hem is't is so devout--the knight or  the t'other?  _Wo._ Both, sir; but the young man especially. I  never heard his like. He has cut his hair too. He is  so well given, and has such good gifts, he can tell you  almost all the stories of the _Book of Martyrs_, and speak  you all the _Sick Man's Salve_[112] without book.  _To._ Ay, if he had had grace--he was brought up  where it grew, I wis. On, Master Wolf.                           61  _Wo._ And he has converted one Fangs, a sergeant, a  fellow could neither write nor read; he was called the  Bandog o' the Counter; and he has brought him already  to pare his nails and say his prayers; and 'tis hoped he  will sell his place shortly, and become an intelligencer.  _To._ No more; I am coming already. If I should  give any farther care I were taken. Adieu, good Master  Wolf. Son, I do feel mine own weaknesses; do not  importune me. Pity is a rheum that I am subject to;  but I will resist it. Master Wolf, fish is cast away that  is cast in dry pools. Tell hypocrisy it will not do; I  have touched and tried too often; I am yet proof, and  I will remain so; when the sessions come they shall hear  from me. In the meantime, to all suits, to all entreaties,  to all letters, to all tricks, I will be deaf as an adder,  and blind as a beetle, lay mine ear to the ground, and  lock mine eyes i' my hand, against all temptations.              78                                                             [_Exit._  _Go._ You see, Master Wolf, how inexorable he is.  There is no hope to recover him. Pray you commend  me to my brother knight, and to my fellow Francis;  present 'hem with this small token of my love; tell 'hem,  I wish I could do 'hem any worthier office; but in this,  'tis desperate: yet I will not fail to try the uttermost of  my power for 'hem. And, sir, as far as I have any  credit with you, pray you let 'hem want nothing; though  I am not ambitious they should know so much.                     87  _Wo._ Sir, both your actions and words speak you to  be a true gentleman. They shall know only what is fit,  and no more.                                                           [_Exeunt._     [111] The _Knight's Ward_, the _Twopenny Ward_, and the     _Hole_ were different divisions of a prison: see Fenner's     _Compter's Commonwealth_, 1617.

Stay there, I'll call him to  you. Master Security!                         _Enter_ SECURITY.  _Sec._ Who calls?  _Ho._ Here's a gentleman would speak with you.  _Sec._ What is he? Is't one that grafts my forehead  now I am in prison, and comes to see how the horns  shoot up and prosper?                                            10  _Ho._ You must pardon him, sir; the old man is a little  crazed with his imprisonment.  _Sec._ What say you to me, sir? Look you here.--My  learned counsel, Master Bramble! cry you mercy, sir!  When saw you my wife?  _Br._ She is now at my house, sir; and desired me  that I would come to visit you, and inquire of you your  case, that we might work some means to get you forth.            18  _Sec._ My case,[113] Master Bramble, is stone walls and  iron grates; you see it, this is the weakest part on't.  And for getting me forth, no means but hang myself,  and so to be carried forth, from which they have here  bound me in intolerable bands.  _Br._ Why, but what is't you are in for, sir?  _Sec._ For my sins, for my sins, sir, whereof marriage is  the greatest. O, had I never married, I had never  known this purgatory, to which hell is a kind of cool  bath in respect; my wife's confederacy, sir, with old  Touchstone, that she might keep her jubilee and the  feast of her new moon. Do you understand me, sir?                30                        _Enter_ QUICKSILVER.  _Qu._ Good sir, go in and talk with him.

I never saw him, I can remember.  _2nd Pr._ Why, it is he that was the gallant prentice of  London--Master Touchstone's man.                                 40  _Fr._ Who?--Quicksilver?  _1st Pr._ Ay, this is he.  _Fr._ Is this he? They say he has been a gallant  indeed.  _1st Pr._ O, the royallest fellow that ever was bred up  i' the city! He would play you his thousand pound  a-night at dice; keep knights' and lords' company; go  with them to bawdy-houses; had his six men in a livery;  kept a stable of hunting-horses, and his wench in her  velvet gown and her cloth of silver. Here's one knight  with him here in prison.                                         51  _Fr._ And how miserably he is changed!  _1st Pr._ O, that's voluntary in him: he gave away all  his rich clothes as soon as ever he came in here among  the prisoners; and will eat o' the basket,[115] for humility.  _Fr._ Why will he do so?  _1st Pr._ Alas, he has no hope of life! He mortifies  himself. He does but linger on till the sessions.  _2nd Pr._ O, he has penned the best thing, that he calls  his Repentance or his _Last Farewell_, that ever you heard.  He is a pretty poet; and for prose--you would wonder  how many prisoners he has helped out, with penning  petitions for 'hem, and not take a penny.

Say he  should be condemned to be carted or whipt for a bawd,  or so, why, I'll lay an execution on him o' two hundred  pound; let him acknowledge a judgment, he shall do it  in half an hour; they shall not at all fetch him out without  paying the execution, o' my word.                                70  _Pe._ But can we not be bailed, Master Bramble?  _Br._ Hardly; there are none of the judges in town,  else you should remove yourself (in spite of him) with a  _habeas corpus_. But if you have a friend to deliver your  tale sensibly to some justice o' the town, that he may  have feeling of it (do you see), you may be bailed; for  as I understand the case, 'tis only done _in terrorem_; and  you shall have an action of false imprisonment against  him when you come out, and perhaps a thousand pound  costs.                                                           80                        _Enter_ Master WOLF.  _Qu._ How now, Master Wolf?--what news?--what  return?  _Wo._ 'Faith, bad all: yonder will be no letters received.  He says the sessions shall determine it. Only, Master  Deputy Golding commends him to you, and with this  token wishes he could do you other good.  _Qu._ I thank him. Good Master Bramble, trouble  our quiet no more; do not molest us in prison thus,  with your winding devices; pray you depart. For my  part, I commit my cause to Him that can succour me;  let God work His will.

He has  forgot me.  _Qu._ Still Eastward-ho was all my word:  But westward I had no regard,  Nor never thought what would come after,  As did, alas! his youngest daughter.  At last the black ox trod o' my foot,[123]                       80  And I saw then what long'd unto 't;  Now cry I, "Touchstone, touch me still,  And make me current by thy skill."  _To._ And I will do it, Francis.  _Wo._ Stay him, Master Deputy; now is the time: we  shall lose the song else.  _Fr._ I protest it is the best that ever I heard.  _Qu._ How like you it, gentlemen?  _All._ O admirable, sir!  _Qu._ This stanze now following, alludes to the story of  Mannington, from whence I took my project for my  invention.                                                       92  _Fr._ Pray you go on, sir.  _Qu._ O Mannington, thy stories show,  Thou cutt'st a horse-head off at a blow!  But I confess, I have not the force  For to cut off the head of a horse;  Yet I desire this grace to win,  That I may cut off the horse-head of Sin,  And leave his body in the dust                                  100  Of sin's highway and bogs of lust,  Whereby I may take Virtue's purse,  And live with her for better, for worse.  _Fr._ Admirable, sir, and excellently conceited!  _Qu._ Alas, sir!  _To._ Son Golding and Master Wolf, I thank you: the  deceit is welcome, especially from thee, whose charitable  soul in this hath shown a high point of wisdom and  honesty. Listen, I am ravished with his repentance,  and could stand here a whole prenticeship to hear  him.                                                            111  _Fr._ Forth, good sir.  _Qu._ This is the last, and the _Farewell_.--  Farewell, Cheapside, farewell, sweet trade  Of Goldsmiths all, that never shall fade;  Farewell, dear fellow prentices all,  And be you warnd by my fall:  Shun usurers, bawds, and dice, and drabs,  Avoid them as you would French scabs.  Seek not to go beyond your tether,                              120  But cut your thongs unto your leather:  So shall you thrive by little and little,  'Scape Tyburn, Counters, and the Spital!  _To._ And 'scape them shalt thou, my penitent and  dear Francis!  _Qu._ Master!  _Pe._ Father!  _To._ I can no longer forbear to do your humility right.  Arise, and let me honour your repentance with the  hearty and joyful embraces of a father and friend's love.  Quicksilver, thou hast eat into my breast, Quicksilver,  with the drops of thy sorrow, and killed the desperate  opinion I had of thy reclaim.                                   133  _Qu._ O, sir, I am not worthy to see your worshipful face!  _Pe._ Forgive me, father.  _To._ Speak no more; all former passages are forgotten;  and here my word shall release you. Thank this worthy  brother, and kind friend, Francis.--Master Wolf, I am  their bail.                                            [_A shout in the prison._  _Sec._ Master Touchstone! Master Touchstone!  _To._ Who's that?  _Wo._ Security, sir.  _Sec._ Pray you, sir, if you'll be won with a song, hear  my lamentable tune too!                                         144                               SONG.                    O Master Touchstone,                      My heart is full of woe;                    Alas, I am a cuckold!                      And why should it be so?                    Because I was a usurer                      And bawd, as all you know,                  150                    For which, again I tell you,                      My heart is full of woe.  _To._ Bring him forth, Master Wolf, and release his  bands. This day shall be sacred to mercy and the mirth  of this encounter in the Counter. See, we are encountered  with more suitors!          _Enter_ Mistress TOUCHSTONE, GERTRUDE, MILDRED,                      SINDEFY, WINIFRED, _&c._  Save your breath, save your breath! All things have  succeeded to your wishes: and we are heartily satisfied  in their events.  _Ge._ Ah, runaway, runaway! have I caught you?  And how has my poor knight done all this while?                 161  _Pe._ Dear lady-wife, forgive me!  _Ge._ As heartily as I would be forgiven, knight. Dear  father, give me your blessing, and forgive me too; I ha'  been proud and lascivious, father; and a fool, father;  and being raised to the state of a wanton coy thing,  called a lady, father; have scorned you, father, and my  sister, and my sister's velvet cap too; and would make  a mouth at the city as I rid through it; and stop mine  ears at Bow-bell. I have said your beard was a base  one, father; and that you looked like Twierpipe the  taberer; and that my mother was but my midwife.                 172  _Mist. T._ Now, God forgi' you, child madam!  _To._ No more repetitions. What else is wanting to  make our harmony full?  _Go._ Only this, sir, that my fellow Francis make amends  to Mistress Sindefy with marriage.  _Qu._ With all my heart.  _Go._ And Security give her a dower, which shall be all  the restitution he shall make of that huge mass he hath  so unlawfully gotten.                                           181  _To._ Excellently devised! a good motion![124] What  says Master Security?  _Sec._ I say anything, sir, what you'll ha' me say. Would  I were no cuckold!  _Wi._ Cuckold, husband? Why, I think this wearing  of yellow[125] has infected you.                                187  _To._ Why, Master Security, that should rather be a  comfort to you than a corasive. If you be a cuckold,  it's an argument you have a beautiful woman to your  wife; then you shall be much made of; you shall have  store of friends, never want money; you shall be eased of  much o' your wedlock pain, others will take it for you.  Besides, you being a usurer (and likely to go to hell),  the devils will never torment you: they'll take you for  one o' their own race. Again, if you be a cuckold, and  know it not, you are an innocent; if you know it and  endure it, a true martyr.                                       198  _Sec._ I am resolved, sir. Come hither, Winny.  _To._ Well, then, all are pleased, or shall be anon.  Master Wolf, you look hungry, methinks; have you no  apparel to lend Francis to shift him?  _Qu._ No, sir, nor I desire none; but here make it my  suit, that I may go home through the streets in these, as  a spectacle, or rather an example to the children of  Cheapside.  _To._ Thou hast thy wish. Now, London, look about,  And in this moral see thy glass run out:  Behold the careful father, thrifty son,  The solemn deeds which each of us have done;                    210  The usurer punish'd, and from fall so steep  The prodigal child reclaim'd, and the lost sheep.     [121] Old ed. "_Enter_ QUICKSILVER, Sir PETRONEL, _&c._"     [122] There was entered in the Stationers' Books, on 7th November     1576, "A woeful Ballad made by Mr. George Mannynton, an houre     before he suffered at Cambridge-castell." The ballad is printed     in Ritson's _Ancient Songs and Ballads_ (ed. 1877), pp.     188-191. It begins:--          "I wayle in woe, I plundge in payne,          With sorrowing sobbes I do complayne,          With wallowing waves I wishe to dye,          I languish sore here as I lye," &c.     [123] "The black ox trod o' my foot"--a proverbial expression,     meaning "trouble came upon me."     [124] Proposition.     [125] The colour of (1) jealousy, (2) Security's prison-dress.                             EPILOGUS.  [_Qu._] Stay, sir, I perceive the multitude are gather'd  together to view our coming out at the Counter. See  if the streets and the Fronts of the Houses be not thick  with people, and the windows fill'd with ladies as on  the solemn day of the pageant!  O may you find in this our pageant here  The same contentment which you came to seek,  And as that show but draws you once a year                      220  May this attract you hither once a week.                                                     [_Exeunt omnes._

Of modern editions, Germany has producedthe only one which is at all reliable, and upon this edition,admirably collated and edited by Drs. Karl Warnke and LudwigProescholdt, and published at Halle in 1886, the present reprintis based, the excellence of text, notes and introduction,leaving little beyond the modernising and some elucidation hereand there to be done.Dekker appears to have had a collaborator in the play in RobertWilson, the actor, who is said to have created the part ofFirk on its performance, but although Wilson may have providedsome of the situations and dialogue, the credit of the play asa whole is undoubtedly Dekker’s. _The Shoemaker’s Holiday_ isthe first of Dekker’s plays, in order of publication, which hassurvived, although according to Henslowe he began to write forthe stage in 1596.The conception of Simon Eyre, the Shoemaker, is taken froma real person of that name, who, according to Stow, was anupholsterer, and afterwards a draper. He built Leadenhall in1419, as referred to by Dekker in Act V., Sc. 5, became Sheriffof London in 1434, was elected Lord Mayor in 1445, and died in1459. About his character nothing certain is known. “It may wellbe,” say the editors of the Halle edition, “that long afterEyre’s death the builder of Leadenhall was supposed to havebeen a shoemaker himself, merely because Leadenhall was used asa leather-market. This tradition was probably taken up by thepoet, who formed out of it one of the most popular comedies ofthe age.”TO ALL GOOD FELLOWS, PROFESSORS OF THE GENTLE CRAFT,[3] OF WHATDEGREE SOEVER.[3] Shoemaking was called “the Gentle Craft,” possibly in partbecause the patron saints of shoemakers, St. Crispin and St.Hugh, were said to be of noble, and even royal, blood; possiblybecause of the sedentary nature of the occupation.Kind gentlemen and honest boon companions, I present you herewith a merry-conceited Comedy, called _The Shoemaker’s Holiday_,acted by my Lord Admiral’s Players this present Christmas beforethe Queen’s most excellent Majesty, for the mirth and pleasantmatter by her Highness graciously accepted, being indeed no wayoffensive. The argument of the play I will set down in thisEpistle: Sir Hugh Lacy, Earl of Lincoln, had a young gentlemanof his own name, his near kinsman, that loved the Lord Mayor’sdaughter of London; to prevent and cross which love, the Earlcaused his kinsman to be sent Colonel of a company into France:who resigned his place to another gentleman his friend, andcame disguised like a Dutch shoemaker to the house of SimonEyre in Tower Street, who served the Mayor and his householdwith shoes: the merriments that passed in Eyre’s house, hiscoming to be Mayor of London, Lacy’s getting his love, and otheraccidents, with two merry Three-men’s-songs. Take all in goodworth that is well intended, for nothing is purposed but mirth;mirth lengtheneth long life, which, with all other blessings, Iheartily wish you. Farewell![PROLOGUE]_As it was pronounced before the Queen’s Majesty._As wretches in a storm (expecting day),With trembling hands and eyes cast up to heaven,Make prayers the anchor of their conquered hopes,So we, dear goddess, wonder of all eyes,Your meanest vassals, through mistrust and fearTo sink into the bottom of disgraceBy our imperfect pastimes, prostrate thusOn bended knees, our sails of hope do strike,Dreading the bitter storms of your dislike.Since then, unhappy men, our hap is such,That to ourselves ourselves no help can bring,But needs must perish, if your saint-like ears(Locking the temple where all mercy sits)Refuse the tribute of our begging tongues:Oh grant, bright mirror of true chastity,From those life-breathing stars, your sun-like eyes,One gracious smile: for your celestial breathMust send us life, or sentence us to death. _DRAMATIS PERSONÆ._]THE KING.THE EARL OF CORNWALL.SIR HUGH LACY, Earl of Lincoln.ROWLAND LACY, otherwise HANS, }ASKEW                         } His Nephews.SIR ROGER OATELEY, Lord Mayor of London.Master HAMMON }Master WARNER } Citizens of London.Master SCOTT  }SIMON EYRE, the Shoemaker.ROGER, commonly called HODGE[4] }FIRK                                     } EYRE’S Journeymen.RALPH                                    }LOVELL, a Courtier.DODGER, Servant to the EARL OF LINCOLN.A DUTCH SKIPPER.A BOY.[4] A diminutive of Roger.Courtiers, Attendants, Officers, Soldiers, Hunters,Shoemakers, Apprentices, Servants.ROSE, Daughter of SIR ROGER.SYBIL, her Maid.MARGERY, Wife of SIMON EYRE.JANE, Wife of RALPH.SCENE--LONDON and OLD FORD._THE SHOEMAKER’S HOLIDAY_ACT THE FIRST.SCENE I.--_A Street in London.__Enter the_ LORD MAYOR _and the_ EARL OF LINCOLN.LINCOLN. My lord mayor, you have sundry timesFeasted myself and many courtiers more:Seldom or never can we be so kindTo make requital of your courtesy.But leaving this, I hear my cousin LacyIs much affected to your daughter Rose._L. Mayor._ True, my good lord, and she loves him so wellThat I mislike her boldness in the chase._Lincoln._ Why, my lord mayor, think you it then a shame,To join a Lacy with an Oateley’s name?_L. Mayor._ Too mean is my poor girl for his high birth;Poor citizens must not with courtiers wed,Who will in silks and gay apparel spendMore in one year than I am worth, by far:Therefore your honour need not doubt my girl._Lincoln._ Take heed, my lord, advise you what you do!A verier unthrift lives not in the world,Than is my cousin; for I’ll tell you what:’Tis now almost a year since he requestedTo travel countries for experience;I furnished him with coin, bills of exchange,Letters of credit, men to wait on him,Solicited my friends in ItalyWell to respect him. But to see the end:Scant had he journeyed through half Germany,But all his coin was spent, his men cast off,His bills embezzled,[5] and my jolly coz,Ashamed to show his bankrupt presence here,Became a shoemaker in Wittenberg,A goodly science for a gentlemanOf such descent! Now judge the rest by this:Suppose your daughter have a thousand pound,He did consume me more in one half year;And make him heir to all the wealth you have,One twelvemonth’s rioting will waste it all.Then seek, my lord, some honest citizenTo wed your daughter to.[5] Wasted, squandered._L. Mayor._              I thank your lordship.(_Aside_) Well, fox, I understand your subtilty.As for your nephew, let your lordship’s eyeBut watch his actions, and you need not fear,For I have sent my daughter far enough.And yet your cousin Rowland might do well,Now he hath learned an occupation;And yet I scorn to call him son-in-law._Lincoln._ Ay, but I have a better trade for him:I thank his grace, he hath appointed himChief colonel of all those companiesMustered in London and the shires about,To serve his highness in those wars of France.See where he comes!-- _Enter_ LOVELL, LACY, _and_ ASKEW.                      Lovell, what news with you?_Lovell._ My Lord of Lincoln, ’tis his highness’ will,That presently your cousin ship for FranceWith all his powers; he would not for a million,But they should land at Dieppe within four days._Lincoln._ Go certify his grace, it shall be done.      [_Exit_ LOVELL.Now, cousin Lacy, in what forwardnessAre all your companies?_Lacy._                 All well prepared.The men of Hertfordshire lie at Mile-end,Suffolk and Essex train in Tothill-fields,The Londoners and those of Middlesex,All gallantly prepared in Finsbury,With frolic spirits long for their parting hour._L. Mayor._ They have their imprest,[6] coats, and furniture;[7]And, if it please your cousin Lacy comeTo the Guildhall, he shall receive his pay;And twenty pounds besides my brethrenWill freely give him, to approve our lovesWe bear unto my lord, your uncle here.[6] Regimental badge or device.[7] Weapons and martial equipment._Lacy._ I thank your honour._Lincoln._                   Thanks, my good lord mayor._L. Mayor._ At the Guildhall we will expect your coming.      [_Exit.__Lincoln._ To approve your loves to me? No subtilty!Nephew, that twenty pound he doth bestowFor joy to rid you from his daughter Rose.But, cousins both, now here are none but friends,I would not have you cast an amorous eyeUpon so mean a project as the loveOf a gay, wanton, painted citizen.I know, this churl even in the height of scornDoth hate the mixture of his blood with thine.I pray thee, do thou so! Remember, coz,What honourable fortunes wait on thee:Increase the king’s love, which so brightly shines,And gilds thy hopes. I have no heir but thee,--And yet not thee, if with a wayward spiritThou start from the true bias of my love._Lacy._ My lord, I will for honour, not desireOf land or livings, or to be your heir,So guide my actions in pursuit of France,As shall add glory to the Lacys’ name._Lincoln._ Coz, for those words here’s thirty Portuguese[8]And, nephew Askew, there’s a few for you.Fair Honour, in her loftiest eminence,Stays in France for you, till you fetch her thence.Then, nephews, clap swift wings on your designs:Begone, begone, make haste to the Guildhall;There presently I’ll meet you. Do not stay:Where honour beckons, shame attends delay.      [_Exit._[8] A gold coin, worth about three pounds twelve shillings._Askew._ How gladly would your uncle have you gone!_Lacy._ True, coz, but I’ll o’erreach his policies.I have some serious business for three days,Which nothing but my presence can dispatch.You, therefore, cousin, with the companies,Shall haste to Dover; there I’ll meet with you:Or, if I stay past my prefixèd time,Away for France; we’ll meet in Normandy.The twenty pounds my lord mayor gives to meYou shall receive, and these ten Portuguese,Part of mine uncle’s thirty. Gentle coz,Have care to our great charge; I know, your wisdomHath tried itself in higher consequence._Askew._ Coz, all myself am yours: yet have this care,To lodge in London with all secrecy;Our uncle Lincoln hath, besides his own,Many a jealous eye, that in your faceStares only to watch means for your disgrace._Lacy._ Stay, cousin, who be these?_Enter_ SIMON EYRE, MARGERY _his wife_,HODGE, FIRK, JANE, _and_RALPH _with a pair of shoes_.[9][9] The quarto has “with a piece.” Piece (old Fr. _bobelin_) wassometimes loosely used for the shoe itself, as well as for thepiece of leather used in repairs. See _Cotgrave_._Eyre._ Leave whining, leave whining! Away with this whimpering,this puling, these blubbering tears, and these wet eyes! I’llget thy husband discharged, I warrant thee, sweet Jane; go to!_Hodge._ Master, here be the captains._Eyre._ Peace, Hodge; hush, ye knave, hush!_Firk._ Here be the cavaliers and the colonels, master._Eyre._ Peace, Firk; peace, my fine Firk! Stand by with yourpishery-pashery,[10] away! I am a man of the best presence;I’ll speak to them, an they were Popes.--Gentlemen, captains,colonels, commanders! Brave men, brave leaders, may it pleaseyou to give me audience. I am Simon Eyre, the mad shoemaker ofTower Street; this wench with the mealy mouth that will nevertire, is my wife, I can tell you; here’s Hodge, my man and myforeman; here’s Firk, my fine firking journeyman, and this isblubbered Jane. All we come to be suitors for this honest Ralph.Keep him at home, and as I am a true shoemaker and a gentlemanof the gentle craft, buy spurs yourselves, and I’ll find yeboots these seven years.[10] Twiddle-twaddle._Marg._ Seven years, husband?_Eyre._ Peace, midriff, peace! I know what I do. Peace!_Firk._ Truly, master cormorant, you shall do God good serviceto let Ralph and his wife stay together. She’s a youngnew-married woman; if you take her husband away from her anight, you undo her; she may beg in the day-time; for he’s asgood a workman at a prick and an awl, as any is in our trade._Jane._ O let him stay, else I shall be undone._Firk._ Ay, truly, she shall be laid at one side like a pair ofold shoes else, and be occupied for no use._Lacy._ Truly, my friends, it lies not in my power:The Londoners are pressed, paid, and set forthBy the lord mayor; I cannot change a man._Hodge._ Why, then you were as good be a corporal as a colonel,if you cannot discharge one good fellow; and I tell you true, Ithink you do more than you can answer, to press a man within ayear and a day of his marriage._Eyre._ Well said, melancholy Hodge; gramercy, my fine foreman._Marg._ Truly, gentlemen, it were ill done for such as you, tostand so stiffly against a poor young wife, considering hercase, she is new-married, but let that pass: I pray, deal notroughly with her; her husband is a young man, and but newlyentered, but let that pass._Eyre._ Away with your pishery-pashery, your pols and youredipols![11] Peace, midriff; silence, Cicely Bumtrinket! Letyour head speak.[11] Apparently one of Eyre’s frequent improvised phrases,referring here to his wife’s trick of repeating herself, as inher previous speech._Firk._ Yea, and the horns too, master._Eyre._ Too soon, my fine Firk, too soon! Peace, scoundrels! Seeyou this man? Captains, you will not release him? Well, let himgo; he’s a proper shot; let him vanish! Peace, Jane, dry up thytears, they’ll make his powder dankish. Take him, brave men;Hector of Troy was an hackney to him, Hercules and Termagant[12]scoundrels, Prince Arthur’s Round-table--by the Lord ofLudgate[13]--ne’er fed such a tall, such a dapper swordsman; bythe life of Pharaoh, a brave, resolute swordsman! Peace, Jane! Isay no more, mad knaves.[12] An imaginary Saracen god, represented in the old moralitiesand plays as of a quite ungodly tendency to violence.[13] A nick-name, possibly, for some character of the day, usedwith a vague reference to King Lud._Firk._ See, see, Hodge, how my master raves in commendation ofRalph!_Hodge._ Ralph, th’art a gull, by this hand, an thou goest not._Askew._ I am glad, good Master Eyre, it is my hapTo meet so resolute a soldier.Trust me, for your report and love to him,A common slight regard shall not respect him._Lacy._ Is thy name Ralph?_Ralph._                   Yes, sir._Lacy._                              Give me thy hand;Thou shalt not want, as I am a gentleman.Woman, be patient; God, no doubt, will sendThy husband safe again; but he must go,His country’s quarrel says it shall be so._Hodge._ Th’art a gull, by my stirrup, if thou dost not go. Iwill not have thee strike thy gimlet into these weak vessels;prick thine enemies, Ralph._Enter_ DODGER._Dodger._ My lord, your uncle on the Tower-hillStays with the lord mayor and the aldermen,And doth request you with all speed you may,To hasten thither._Askew._           Cousin, let’s go._Lacy._ Dodger, run you before, tell them we come.--This Dodger is mine uncle’s parasite,      [_Exit_ DODGER.The arrant’st varlet that e’er breathed on earth;He sets more discord in a noble houseBy one day’s broaching of his pickthank tales,[14]Than can be salved again in twenty years,And he, I fear, shall go with us to France,To pry into our actions.[14] Tales told to curry favour._Askew._                 Therefore, coz,It shall behove you to be circumspect._Lacy._ Fear not, good cousin.--Ralph, hie to your colours._Ralph._ I must, because there’s no remedy;But, gentle master and my loving dame,As you have always been a friend to me,So in mine absence think upon my wife._Jane._ Alas, my Ralph._Marg._ She cannot speak for weeping._Eyre._ Peace, you cracked groats,[15] you mustard tokens,[16]disquiet not the brave soldier. Go thy ways, Ralph![15] The groat was the silver fourpenny-piece. The simile of acracked coin is an obvious expression of worthlessness.[16] Little yellow spots on the body which denoted the infectionof the plague._Jane._ Ay, ay, you bid him go; what shall I doWhen he is gone?_Firk._ Why, be doing with me or my fellow Hodge; be not idle._Eyre._ Let me see thy hand, Jane. This fine hand, this whitehand, these pretty fingers must spin, must card, must work;work, you bombast-cotton-candle-quean;[17] work for your living,with a pox to you.--Hold thee, Ralph, here’s five sixpencesfor thee; fight for the honour of the gentle craft, for thegentlemen shoemakers, the courageous cordwainers, the flowerof St. Martin’s, the mad knaves of Bedlam, Fleet Street, TowerStreet and Whitechapel; crack me the crowns of the Frenchknaves; a pox on them, crack them; fight, by the Lord ofLudgate; fight, my fine boy![17] Another of Eyre’s improvised phrases, whose component partssufficiently explain its meaning._Firk._ Here, Ralph, here’s three twopences: two carry intoFrance, the third shall wash our souls at parting, for sorrow isdry. For my sake, firk the _Basa mon cues_._Hodge._ Ralph, I am heavy at parting; but here’s a shillingfor thee. God send thee to cram thy slops with French crowns,and thy enemies’ bellies with bullets._Ralph._ I thank you, master, and I thank you all.Now, gentle wife, my loving lovely Jane,Rich men, at parting, give their wives rich gifts,Jewels and rings, to grace their lily hands.Thou know’st our trade makes rings for women’s heels:Here take this pair of shoes, cut out by Hodge,Stitched by my fellow Firk, seamed by myself,Made up and pinked with letters for thy name.Wear them, my dear Jane, for thy husband’s sake;And every morning, when thou pull’st them on,Remember me, and pray for my return.Make much of them; for I have made them so,That I can know them from a thousand mo._Drum sounds. Enter the_ LORD MAYOR, _the ~Earl~of_ LINCOLN, LACY, ASKEW,DODGER, _and ~Soldiers~. They pass over the stage_;RALPH _falls in amongst them_; FIRK _and therest cry ~“Farewell,” etc.~, and so exeunt_.ACT THE SECOND.SCENE I.--_A Garden at Old Ford.__Enter_ ROSE, _alone, making a garland_.Rose. Here sit thou down upon this flow’ry bank,And make a garland for thy Lacy’s head.These pinks, these roses, and these violets,These blushing gilliflowers, these marigolds,The fair embroidery of his coronet,Carry not half such beauty in their cheeks,As the sweet countenance of my Lacy doth.O my most unkind father! O my stars,Why lowered you so at my nativity,To make me love, yet live robbed of my love?Here as a thief am I imprisonëdFor my dear Lacy’s sake within those walls,Which by my father’s cost were builded upFor better purposes; here must I languishFor him that doth as much lament, I know,Mine absence, as for him I pine in woe._Enter_ SYBIL._Sybil._ Good morrow, young mistress. I am sure you make thatgarland for me; against I shall be Lady of the Harvest._Rose._ Sybil, what news at London?_Sybil._ None but good; my lord mayor, your father, and masterPhilpot, your uncle, and Master Scot, your cousin, and MistressFrigbottom by Doctors’ Commons, do all, by my troth, send youmost hearty commendations._Rose._ Did Lacy send kind greetings to his love?_Sybil._ O yes, out of cry, by my troth. I scant knew him; here’a wore a scarf; and here a scarf, here a bunch of feathers,and here precious stones and jewels, and a pair of garters,--O,monstrous! like one of our yellow silk curtains at home here inOld Ford house, here in Master Belly-mount’s chamber. I stood atour door in Cornhill, looked at him, he at me indeed, spake tohim, but he not to me, not a word; marry go-up, thought I, witha wanion![18] He passed by me as proud--Marry foh! are you grownhumorous, thought I; and so shut the door, and in I came.[18] With a vengeance._Rose._ O Sybil, how dost thou my Lacy wrong!My Rowland is as gentle as a lamb,No dove was ever half so mild as he._Sybil._ Mild? yea, as a bushel of stamped crabs.[19] He lookedupon me as sour as verjuice. Go thy ways, thought I; thou may’stbe much in my gaskins,[20] but nothing in my nether-stocks. Thisis your fault, mistress, to love him that loves not you; hethinks scorn to do as he’s done to; but if I were as you, I’dcry: Go by, Jeronimo, go by![21][19] Crushed crab apples.[20] A kind of trousers, first worn by the Gascons.[21] A phrase from Kyd’s _Spanish Tragedy_.I’d set mine old debts against my new driblets,And the hare’s foot against the goose giblets,For if ever I sigh, when sleep I should take,Pray God I may lose my maidenhead when I wake._Rose._ Will my love leave me then, and go to France?_Sybil._ I know not that, but I am sure I see him stalk beforethe soldiers. By my troth, he is a proper man; but he is properthat proper doth. Let him go snick-up,[22] young mistress.[22] _i.e._ Go and be hanged!_Rose._ Get thee to London, and learn perfectly,Whether my Lacy go to France, or no.Do this, and I will give thee for thy painsMy cambric apron and my Romish gloves,My purple stockings and a stomacher.Say, wilt thou do this, Sybil, for my sake?_Sybil._ Will I, quoth a? At whose suit? By my troth, yes I’llgo. A cambric apron, gloves, a pair of purple stockings, and astomacher! I’ll sweat in purple, mistress, for you; I’ll takeanything that comes a God’s name. O rich! a cambric apron!Faith, then have at ‘up tails all.’ I’ll go jiggy-joggy toLondon, and be here in a trice, young mistress. [_Exit.__Rose._ Do so, good Sybil. Meantime wretched IWill sit and sigh for his lost company.      [_Exit._SCENE II.--_A Street in London.__Enter_ LACY, _disguised as a Dutch Shoemaker_._Lacy._ How many shapes have gods and kings devised,Thereby to compass their desired loves!It is no shame for Rowland Lacy, then,To clothe his cunning with the gentle craft,That, thus disguised, I may unknown possessThe only happy presence of my Rose.For her have I forsook my charge in France,Incurred the king’s displeasure, and stirred upRough hatred in mine uncle Lincoln’s breast.O love, how powerful art thou, that canst changeHigh birth to baseness, and a noble mindTo the mean semblance of a shoemaker!But thus it must be. For her cruel father,Hating the single union of our souls,Has secretly conveyed my Rose from London,To bar me of her presence; but I trust,Fortune and this disguise will further meOnce more to view her beauty, gain her sight.Here in Tower Street with Eyre the shoemakerMean I a while to work; I know the trade,I learnt it when I was in Wittenberg.Then cheer thy hoping spirits, be not dismayed,Thou canst not want: do Fortune what she can,The gentle craft is living for a man.      [_Exit._SCENE III.--_An open Yard before_ EYRE’S _House_._Enter_ EYRE, _making himself ready_.[23][23] _i.e._ Dressing himself._Eyre._ Where be these boys, these girls, these drabs, thesescoundrels? They wallow in the fat brewiss[24] of my bounty,and lick up the crumbs of my table, yet will not rise to seemy walks cleansed. Come out, you powder-beef[25] queans!What, Nan! what, Madge Mumble-crust. Come out, you fatmidriff-swag-belly-whores, and sweep me these kennels that thenoisome stench offend not the noses of my neighbours. What,Firk, I say; what, Hodge! Open my shop-windows! What, Firk, Isay![24] Bread soaked in pot liquor, and prepared _secundumartem_.--_Nares._[25] Salted beef._Enter_ FIRK._Firk._ O master, is’t you that speak bandog[26] and Bedlamthis morning? I was in a dream, and mused what madman was gotinto the street so early; have you drunk this morning that yourthroat is so clear?[26] A dog kept fastened up as a watch-dog, and therefore givento loud barking._Eyre._ Ah, well said, Firk; well said, Firk. To work, my fineknave, to work! Wash thy face, and thou’lt be more blest._Firk._ Let them wash my face that will eat it. Good master,send for a souse-wife,[27] if you’ll have my face cleaner.[27] A woman who washed and pickled pigs’ faces._Enter_ HODGE._Eyre._ Away, sloven! avaunt, scoundrel!--Good-morrow, Hodge;good-morrow, my fine foreman._Hodge._ O master, good-morrow; y’are an early stirrer. Here’s afair morning.--Good-morrow, Firk, I could have slept this hour.Here’s a brave day towards._Eyre._ Oh, haste to work, my fine foreman, haste to work._Firk._ Master, I am dry as dust to hear my fellow Roger talkof fair weather; let us pray for good leather, and let clownsand ploughboys and those that work in the fields pray for bravedays. We work in a dry shop; what care I if it rain?_Enter_ MARGERY._Eyre._ How now, Dame Margery, can you see to rise? Trip and go,call up the drabs, your maids._Marg._ See to rise? I hope ’tis time enough, ’tis early enoughfor any woman to be seen abroad. I marvel how many wives inTower Street are up so soon. Gods me, ’tis not noon,--here’s ayawling![28][28] Bawling._Eyre._ Peace, Margery, peace! Where’s Cicely Bumtrinket, yourmaid? She has a privy fault, she farts in her sleep. Call thequean up; if my men want shoe-thread, I’ll swinge her in astirrup._Firk._ Yet, that’s but a dry beating; here’s still a sign ofdrought._Enter_ LACY _disguised, singing_._Lacy._ _Der was een bore van Gelderland           Frolick sie byen;         He was als dronck he cold nyet stand,           Upsolce sie byen.         Tap eens de canneken,         Drincke, schone mannekin._[29][29]There was a boor from Gelderland,      Jolly they be;He was so drunk he could not stand,      Drunken they be:Clink then the cannikin,Drink, pretty mannikin!_Firk._ Master, for my life, yonder’s a brother of the gentlecraft; if he bear not Saint Hugh’s bones,[30] I’ll forfeit mybones; he’s some uplandish workman: hire him, good master, thatI may learn some gibble-gabble; ’twill make us work the faster.[30] St. Hugh was the patron saint of shoemakers, and his boneswere supposed to have been made into shoemaker’s tools, forwhich this came to be a common term._Eyre._ Peace, Firk! A hard world! Let him pass, let him vanish;we have journeymen enow. Peace, my fine Firk!_Marg._ Nay, nay, y’are best follow your man’s counsel; youshall see what will come on’t: we have not men enow, but we mustentertain every butter-box; but let that pass._Hodge._ Dame, ’fore God, if my master follow your counsel,he’ll consume little beef. He shall be glad of men, and he cancatch them._Firk._ Ay, that he shall._Hodge._ ’Fore God, a proper man, and I warrant, a fine workman.Master, farewell; dame, adieu; if such a man as he cannot findwork, Hodge is not for you. [_Offers to go.__Eyre._ Stay, my fine Hodge._Firk._ Faith, an your foreman go, dame, you must take ajourney to seek a new journeyman; if Roger remove, Firk follows.If Saint Hugh’s bones shall not be set a-work, I may prick mineawl in the walls, and go play. Fare ye well, master; good-bye,dame._Eyre._ Tarry, my fine Hodge, my brisk foreman! Stay, Firk!Peace, pudding-broth! By the Lord of Ludgate, I love my men asmy life. Peace, you gallimafry[31] Hodge, if he want work, I’llhire him. One of you to him; stay,--he comes to us.[31] A dish of different hashed meats._Lacy._ _Goeden dach, meester, ende u vro oak._[32][32] Good day, master, and your wife too._Firk._ Nails, if I should speak after him without drinking, Ishould choke. And you, friend Oake, are you of the gentle craft?_Lacy._ _Yaw, yaw, ik bin den skomawker._[33][33] Yes, yes, I am a shoemaker._Firk._ _Den skomaker_, quoth a! And hark you, _skomaker_, haveyou all your tools, a good rubbing-pin, a good stopper, a gooddresser, your four sorts of awls, and your two balls of wax,your paring knife, your hand- and thumb-leathers, and good St.Hugh’s bones to smooth up your work?_Lacy._ _Yaw, yaw; be niet vorveard. Ik hab all de dingen voourmack skooes groot and cleane._[34][34] Yes, yes; be not afraid. I have everything, to make bootsbig and little._Firk._ Ha, ha! Good master, hire him; he’ll make me laugh sothat I shall work more in mirth than I can in earnest._Eyre._ Hear ye, friend, have ye any skill in the mystery ofcordwainers?_Lacy._ _Ik weet niet wat yow seg; ich verstaw you niet._[35][35] I don’t know what you say; I don’t understand you._Firk._ Why, thus, man: (_Imitating by gesture a shoemaker atwork_) _Ick verste u niet_, quoth a._Lacy._ _Yaw, yaw, yaw; ick can dat wel doen._[36][36] Yes, yes, yes; I can do that very well._Firk._ _Yaw, yaw!_ He speaks yawing like a jackdaw that gapesto be fed with cheese-curds. Oh, he’ll give a villanous pull ata can of double-beer; but Hodge and I have the vantage, we mustdrink first, because we are the eldest journeymen._Eyre._ What is thy name?_Lacy._ Hans--Hans Meulter._Eyre._ Give me thy hand; th’art welcome.--Hodge, entertain him;Firk, bid him welcome; come, Hans. Run, wife, bid your maids,your trullibubs,[37] make ready my fine men’s breakfasts. Tohim, Hodge![37] Slatterns, sluts._Hodge._ Hans, th’art welcome; use thyself friendly, for weare good fellows; if not, thou shalt be fought with, wert thoubigger than a giant._Firk._ Yea, and drunk with, wert thou Gargantua. My masterkeeps no cowards, I tell thee.--Ho, boy, bring him anheel-block, here’s a new journeyman._Enter_ Boy._Lacy._ _O, ich wersto you; ich moet een halve dossencans betaelen; here, boy, nempt dis skilling, tap eensfreelicke._[38] [_Exit_ Boy.[38] O, I understand you; I must pay for half-a-dozen cans;here, boy, take this shilling, tap this once freely._Eyre._ Quick, snipper-snapper, away! Firk, scour thy throat,thou shalt wash it with Castilian liquor._Enter_ Boy.Come, my last of the fives, give me a can. Have to thee, Hans;here, Hodge; here, Firk; drink, you mad Greeks, and work liketrue Trojans, and pray for Simon Eyre, the shoemaker.--Here,Hans, and th’art welcome._Firk._ Lo, dame, you would have lost a good fellow that willteach us to laugh. This beer came hopping in well._Marg._ Simon, it is almost seven._Eyre._ Is’t so, Dame Clapper-dudgeon?[39] Is’t seven a clock,and my men’s breakfast not ready? Trip and go, you sousedconger,[40] away! Come, you mad hyperboreans; follow me, Hodge;follow me, Hans; come after, my fine Firk; to work, to work awhile, and then to breakfast! [_Exit._[39] Cant term for a beggar.[40] Conger-eel._Firk._ Soft! _Yaw, yaw_, good Hans, though my master have nomore wit but to call you afore me, I am not so foolish to gobehind you, I being the elder journeyman. [_Exeunt._SCENE IV.--_A Field near Old Ford.__Holloaing within. Enter ~Master~_ WARNER _and ~Master~_ HAMMON,_attired as ~Hunters~_._Ham._ Cousin, beat every brake, the game’s not far,This way with wingèd feet he fled from death,Whilst the pursuing hounds, scenting his steps,Find out his highway to destruction.Besides, the miller’s boy told me even now,He saw him take soil,[41] and he holloaed him,Affirming him to have been so embost[42]That long he could not hold.[41] Take cover.[42] Spent; panting with exhaustion._Warn._                      If it be so,’Tis best we trace these meadows by Old Ford._A noise of ~Hunters~ within. Enter a ~Boy~.__Ham._ How now, boy? Where’s the deer? speak, saw’st thou him?_Boy._ O yea; I saw him leap through a hedge, and then over aditch, then at my lord mayor’s pale, over he skipped me, andin he went me, and “holla” the hunters cried, and “there, boy;there, boy!” But there he is, ’a mine honesty._Ham._ Boy, God amercy. Cousin, let’s away;I hope we shall find better sport to-day.      [_Exeunt._SCENE V.--_Another part of the Field.__Hunting within. Enter_ ROSE _and_ SYBIL._Rose._ Why, Sybil, wilt thou prove a forester?_Sybil._ Upon some, no; forester, go by; no, faith, mistress.The deer came running into the barn through the orchard and overthe pale; I wot well, I looked as pale as a new cheese to seehim. But whip, says Goodman Pin-close, up with his flail, andour Nick with a prong, and down he fell, and they upon him, andI upon them. By my troth, we had such sport; and in the end weended him; his throat we cut, flayed him, unhorned him, and mylord mayor shall eat of him anon, when he comes. [_Horns soundwithin.__Rose._ Hark, hark, the hunters come; y’are best take heed,They’ll have a saying to you for this deed._Enter_ Master HAMMON, Master WARNER,Huntsmen, _and_ Boy._Ham._ God save you, fair ladies._Sybil._                          Ladies! O gross![43][43] Stupid._Warn._ Came not a buck this way?_Rose._                            No, but two does._Ham._ And which way went they? Faith, we’ll hunt at those._Sybil._ At those? upon some, no: when, can you tell?_Warn._ Upon some, ay?_Sybil._               Good Lord!_Warn._                    Wounds! Then farewell!_Ham._ Boy, which way went he?_Boy._                        This way, sir, he ran._Ham._ This way he ran indeed, fair Mistress Rose; Our game waslately in your orchard seen._Warn._ Can you advise, which way he took his flight?_Sybil._ Follow your nose; his horns will guide you right._Warn._ Th’art a mad wench._Sybil._                   O, rich!_Rose._                             Trust me, not I.It is not like that the wild forest-deerWould come so near to places of resort;You are deceived, he fled some other way._Warn._ Which way, my sugar-candy, can you shew?_Sybil._ Come up, good honeysops, upon some, no._Rose._ Why do you stay, and not pursue your game?_Sybil._ I’ll hold my life, their hunting-nags be lame._Ham._ A deer more dear is found within this place._Rose._ But not the deer, sir, which you had in chase._Ham._ I chased the deer, but this dear chaseth me._Rose._ The strangest hunting that ever I see.But where’s your park? [_She offers to go away.__Ham._                 ’Tis here: O stay!_Rose._ Impale me, and then I will not stray._Warn._ They wrangle, wench; we are more kind than they._Sybil._ What kind of hart is that dear heart, you seek?_Warn._ A hart, dear heart._Sybil._                    Who ever saw the like?_Rose._ To lose your heart, is’t possible you can?_Ham._ My heart is lost._Rose._                  Alack, good gentleman!_Ham._ This poor lost hart would I wish you might find._Rose._ You, by such luck, might prove your hart a hind._Ham._ Why, Luck had horns, so have I heard some say._Rose._ Now, God, an’t be his will, send Luck into your way._Enter the_ LORD MAYOR _and_ Servants._L. Mayor._ What, Master Hammon? Welcome to Old Ford!_Sybil._ Gods pittikins, hands off, sir! Here’s my lord._L. Mayor._ I hear you had ill luck, and lost your game._Ham._ ’Tis true, my lord._L. Mayor._               I am sorry for the same.What gentleman is this?_Ham._                  My brother-in-law._L. Mayor._ Y’are welcome both; sith Fortune offers youInto my hands, you shall not part from hence,Until you have refreshed your wearied limbs.Go, Sybil, cover the board! You shall be guestTo no good cheer, but even a hunter’s feast._Ham._ I thank your lordship.--Cousin, on my life,For our lost venison I shall find a wife.      [_Exeunt.__L. Mayor._ In, gentlemen; I’ll not be absent long.--This Hammon is a proper gentleman,A citizen by birth, fairly allied;How fit an husband were he for my girl!Well, I will in, and do the best I can,To match my daughter to this gentleman.      [_Exit._ACT THE THIRD.SCENE I.--_A Room in_ EYRE’S _House_._Enter_ LACY _otherwise_ HANS, Skipper, HODGE, _and_ FIRK.SKIP. _Ick sal yow wat seggen, Hans; dis skip, dot comen fromCandy, is al vol, by Got’s sacrament, van sugar, civet, almonds,cambrick, end alle dingen, towsand towsand ding. Nempt it, Hans,nempt it vor v meester. Daer be de bils van laden. Your meesterSimon Eyre sal hae good copen. Wat seggen yow, Hans?_[44][44] I’ll tell you what, Hans; this ship that is come fromCandia, is quite full, by God’s sacrament, of sugar, civet,almonds, cambric, and all things; a thousand, thousand things.Take it, Hans, take it for your master. There are the bills oflading. Your master, Simon Eyre, shall have a good bargain. Whatsay you, Hans?_Firk._ _Wat seggen de reggen de copen, slopen_--laugh, Hodge,laugh!_Hans._ _Mine liever broder Firk, bringt Meester Eyre tot detsigne vn Swannekin; daer sal yow finde dis skipper end me. Watseggen yow, broder Firk? Doot it, Hodge._[45] Come, skipper.[_Exeunt._[45] My dear brother Firk, bring Master Eyre to the sign of theSwan; there shall you find this skipper and me. What say you,brother Firk? Do it, Hodge.--[There were at this time two innswith the sign of the Swan in London, one at Dowgate, the otherin Old Fish Street.]_Firk._ Bring him, quoth you? Here’s no knavery, to bring mymaster to buy a ship worth the lading of two or three hundredthousand pounds. Alas, that’s nothing; a trifle, a bauble, Hodge._Hodge._ The truth is, Firk, that the merchant owner of the shipdares not shew his head, and therefore this skipper that dealsfor him, for the love he bears to Hans, offers my master Eyrea bargain in the commodities. He shall have a reasonable dayof payment; he may sell the wares by that time, and be an hugegainer himself._Firk._ Yea, but can my fellow Hans lend my master twentyporpentines as an earnest penny?_Hodge._ Portuguese,[46] thou wouldst say; here they be, Firk;hark, they jingle in my pocket like St. Mary Overy’s bells.[47][46] A coin worth about three pounds twelve shillings.[47] “East from the Bishop of Winchester’s house, directly overagainst it, stands a fair church, called St. Mary over the Rie,or Overie, that is, over the water.”--_Stow’s Survey of London.__Enter_ EYRE _and_ MARGERY._Firk._ Mum, here comes my dame and my master. She’ll scold, onmy life, for loitering this Monday; but all’s one, let them allsay what they can, Monday’s our holiday._Marg._ You sing, Sir Sauce, but I beshrew your heart,I fear, for this your singing we shall smart._Firk._ Smart for me, dame; why, dame, why?_Hodge._ Master, I hope you’ll not suffer my dame to take downyour journeymen._Firk._ If she take me down, I’ll take her up; yea, and take herdown too, a button-hole lower._Eyre._ Peace, Firk; not I, Hodge; by the life of Pharaoh, bythe Lord of Ludgate, by this beard, every hair whereof I valueat a king’s ransom, she shall not meddle with you.--Peace, youbombast-cotton-candle-quean; away, queen of clubs; quarrel notwith me and my men, with me and my fine Firk; I’ll firk you, ifyou do._Marg._ Yea, yea, man, you may use me as you please; but letthat pass._Eyre._ Let it pass, let it vanish away; peace! Am I notSimon Eyre? Are not these my brave men, brave shoemakers, allgentlemen of the gentle craft? Prince am I none, yet am I noblyborn, as being the sole son of a shoemaker. Away, rubbish!vanish, melt; melt like kitchen-stuff._Marg._ Yea, yea, ’tis well; I must be called rubbish,kitchen-stuff, for a sort of knaves._Firk._ Nay, dame, you shall not weep and wail in woe forme. Master, I’ll stay no longer; here’s an inventory of myshop-tools. Adieu, master; Hodge, farewell._Hodge._ Nay, stay, Firk; thou shalt not go alone._Marg._ I pray, let them go; there be more maids than Mawkin,more men than Hodge, and more fools than Firk._Firk._ Fools? Nails! if I tarry now, I would my guts might beturned to shoe-thread._Hodge._ And if I stay, I pray God I may be turned to a Turk,and set in Finsbury[48] for boys to shoot at.--Come, Firk.[48] Finsbury was a famous practising ground for archery at thistime._Eyre._ Stay, my fine knaves, you arms of my trade, you pillarsof my profession. What, shall a tittle-tattle’s words make youforsake Simon Eyre?--Avaunt, kitchen-stuff! Rip, you brown-breadTannikin;[49] out of my sight! Move me not! Have not I ta’en youfrom selling tripes in Eastcheap, and set you in my shop, andmade you hail-fellow with Simon Eyre, the shoemaker? And now doyou deal thus with my journeymen? Look, you powder-beef-quean,on the face of Hodge, here’s a face for a lord.[49] A name given to Dutchwomen._Firk._ And here’s a face for any lady in Christendom._Eyre._ Rip, you chitterling, avaunt! Boy, bid the tapster ofthe Boar’s Head fill me a dozen cans of beer for my journeymen._Firk._ A dozen cans? O, brave! Hodge, now I’ll stay._Eyre._ (_In a low voice to the_ Boy). An the knave fills anymore than two, he pays for them. (_Exit_ Boy. _Aloud._) A dozencans of beer for my journeymen. (_Re-enter_ Boy.) Here, youmad Mesopotamians, wash your livers with this liquor. Where bethe odd ten? No more, Madge, no more.--Well said. Drink and towork!--What work dost thou, Hodge? what work?_Hodge._ I am a making a pair of shoes for my lord mayor’sdaughter, Mistress Rose._Firk._ And I a pair of shoes for Sybil, my lord’s maid. I dealwith her._Eyre._ Sybil? Fie, defile not thy fine workmanly fingerswith the feet of kitchenstuff and basting-ladles. Ladies ofthe court, fine ladies, my lads, commit their feet to ourapparelling; put gross work to Hans. Yark and seam, yark andseam!_Firk._ For yarking and seaming let me alone, an I come to’t._Hodge._ Well, master, all this is from the bias.[50] Do youremember the ship my fellow Hans told you of? The skipper and heare both drinking at the Swan. Here be the Portuguese to giveearnest. If you go through with it, you cannot choose but be alord at least.[50] By the way, beside the question._Firk._ Nay, dame, if my master prove not a lord, and you alady, hang me._Marg._ Yea, like enough, if you may loiter and tipple thus._Firk._ Tipple, dame? No, we have been bargaining with SkellumSkanderbag:[51] can you Dutch spreaken for a ship of silkCyprus, laden with sugar-candy.[51] German: Schelm, a scoundrel. Skanderbag, or Scander Beg(_i.e._ Lord Alexander), a Turkish name for John Kastriota, theAlbanian hero, who freed his country from the yoke of the Turks(1443-1467). _Enter ~Boy~ with a velvet coat and an Alderman’s gown._EYRE _puts them on_._Eyre._ Peace, Firk; silence, Tittle-tattle! Hodge, I’ll gothrough with it. Here’s a seal-ring, and I have sent for aguarded gown[52] and a damask cassock. See where it comes; lookhere, Maggy; help me, Firk; apparel me, Hodge; silk and satin,you mad Philistines, silk and satin.[52] A robe ornamented with guards or facings._Firk._ Ha, ha, my master will be as proud as a dog in adoublet, all in beaten[53] damask and velvet.[53] Stamped._Eyre._ Softly, Firk, for rearing[54] of the nap, and wearingthreadbare my garments. How dost thou like me, Firk? How do Ilook, my fine Hodge?[54] Raising up, ruffling._Hodge._ Why, now you look like yourself, master. I warrant you,there’s few in the city, but will give you the wall, and comeupon you with the right worshipful._Firk._ Nails, my master looks like a threadbare cloak newturned and dressed. Lord, Lord, to see what good raiment doth!Dame, dame, are you not enamoured?_Eyre._ How say’st thou, Maggy, am I not brisk? Am I not fine?_Marg._ Fine? By my troth, sweetheart, very fine! By my troth,I never liked thee so well in my life, sweetheart; but let thatpass. I warrant, there be many women in the city have not suchhandsome husbands, but only for their apparel; but let that passtoo._Re-enter_ HANS _and_ Skipper._Hans._ _Godden day, mester. Dis be de skipper dat heb de skipvan marchandice; de commodity ben good; nempt it, master, nemptit._[55][55] Good day, master. This is the skipper that has the ship ofmerchandise; the commodity is good; take it, master, take it._Eyre._ Godamercy, Hans; welcome, skipper. Where lies this shipof merchandise?_Skip._ _De skip ben in revere; dor be van Sugar, cyvet,almonds, cambrick, and a towsand towsand tings, gotz sacrament;nempt it, mester: ye sal heb good copen._[56][56] The ship lies in the river; there are sugar, civet,almonds, cambric, and a thousand thousand things, by God’ssacrament, take it, master; you shall have a good bargain._Firk._ To him, master! O sweet master! O sweet wares! Prunes,almonds, sugar-candy, carrot-roots, turnips, O brave fattingmeat! Let not a man buy a nutmeg but yourself._Eyre._ Peace, Firk! Come, skipper, I’ll go aboard withyou.--Hans, have you made him drink?_Skip._ _Yaw, yaw, ic heb veale gedrunck._[57][57] Yes, yes, I have drunk well._Eyre._ Come, Hans, follow me. Skipper, thou shalt have mycountenance in the city. [_Exeunt.__Firk._ _Yaw, heb veale gedrunck_, quoth a. They may well becalled butter-boxes, when they drink fat veal and thick beertoo. But come, dame, I hope you’ll chide us no more._Marg._ No, faith, Firk; no, perdy,[58] Hodge. I do feel honourcreep upon me, and which is more, a certain rising in my flesh;but let that pass.[58] Fr. _Par Dieu_. The word here means “truly.”_Firk._ Rising in your flesh do you feel, say you? Ay, you maybe with child, but why should not my master feel a rising inhis flesh, having a gown and a gold ring on? But you are such ashrew, you’ll soon pull him down._Marg._ Ha, ha! prithee, peace! Thou mak’st my worship laugh;but let that pass. Come, I’ll go in; Hodge, prithee, go beforeme; Firk, follow me._Firk._ Firk doth follow: Hodge, pass out in state. [_Exeunt._SCENE II.--_London: a Room in_ LINCOLN’S _House_._Enter_ the EARL OF LINCOLN _and_ DODGER._Lincoln._ How now, good Dodger, what’s the news in France?_Dodger._ My lord, upon the eighteenth day of MayThe French and English were prepared to fight;Each side with eager fury gave the signOf a most hot encounter. Five long hoursBoth armies fought together; at the lengthThe lot of victory fell on our side.Twelve thousand of the Frenchmen that day died,Four thousand English, and no man of nameBut Captain Hyam and young Ardington,Two gallant gentlemen, I knew them well._Lincoln._ But Dodger, prithee, tell me, in this fightHow did my cousin Lacy bear himself?_Dodger._ My lord, your cousin Lacy was not there._Lincoln._ Not there?_Dodger._             No, my good lord._Lincoln._                              Sure, thou mistakest.I saw him shipped, and a thousand eyes besideWere witnesses of the farewells which he gave,When I, with weeping eyes, bid him adieu.Dodger, take heed._Dodger._          My lord, I am advised,That what I spake is true: to prove it so,His cousin Askew, that supplied his place,Sent me for him from France, that secretlyHe might convey himself thither._Lincoln._                       Is’t even so?Dares he so carelessly venture his lifeUpon the indignation of a king?Has he despised my love, and spurned those favoursWhich I with prodigal hand poured on his head?He shall repent his rashness with his soul;Since of my love he makes no estimate,I’ll make him wish he had not known my hate.Thou hast no other news?_Dodger._                None else, my lord._Lincoln._ None worse I know thou hast.--Procure the kingTo crown his giddy brows with ample honours,Send him chief colonel, and all my hopeThus to be dashed! But ’tis in vain to grieve,One evil cannot a worse relieve.Upon my life, I have found out his plot;That old dog, Love, that fawned upon him so,Love to that puling girl, his fair-cheeked Rose,The lord mayor’s daughter, hath distracted him,And in the fire of that love’s lunacyHath he burnt up himself, consumed his credit,Lost the king’s love, yea, and I fear, his life,Only to get a wanton to his wife,Dodger, it is so._Dodger._         I fear so, my good lord._Lincoln._ It is so--nay, sure it cannot be!I am at my wits’ end. Dodger!_Dodger._                     Yea, my lord._Lincoln._ Thou art acquainted with my nephew’s haunts;Spend this gold for thy pains; go seek him out;Watch at my lord mayor’s--there if he live,Dodger, thou shalt be sure to meet with him.Prithee, be diligent.--Lacy, thy nameLived once in honour, now ’tis dead in shame.--Be circumspect.

I judge it right,Men love their hearts best when th’are out of sight._Ham._ I love you, by this hand._Rose._                          Yet hands off now!If flesh be frail, how weak and frail’s your vow!_Ham._ Then by my life I swear._Rose._                         Then do not brawl;One quarrel loseth wife and life and all.Is not your meaning thus?_Ham._               In faith, you jest._Rose._ Love loves to sport; therefore leave love, y’are best._L. Mayor._ What? square they, Master Scott?_Scott._                                     Sir, never doubt,Lovers are quickly in, and quickly out._Ham._ Sweet Rose, be not so strange in fancying me.Nay, never turn aside, shun not my sight;I am not grown so fond, to fond[59] my loveOn any that shall quit it with disdain;If you will love me, so--if not, farewell.[59] Found, set; a play upon fond._L. Mayor._ Why, how now, lovers, are you both agreed?_Ham._ Yes, faith, my lord._L. Mayor._                 ’Tis well, give me your hand.Give me yours, daughter.--How now, both pull back!What means this, girl?_Rose._                I mean to live a maid._Ham._ But not to die one; pause, ere that be said.      [_Aside.__L. Mayor._ Will you still cross me, still be obstinate?_Ham._ Nay, chide her not, my lord, for doing well;If she can live an happy virgin’s life,’Tis far more blessed than to be a wife._Rose._ Say, sir, I cannot: I have made a vow,Whoever be my husband, ’tis not you._L. Mayor._ Your tongue is quick; but Master Hammon, know,I bade you welcome to another end._Ham._ What, would you have me pule and pine and pray,  With ‘lovely lady,’ ‘mistress of my heart,’‘Pardon your servant,’ and the rhymer play,  Railing on Cupid and his tyrant’s-dart;Or shall I undertake some martial spoil,Wearing your glove at tourney and at tilt,And tell how many gallants I unhorsed--Sweet, will this pleasure you?_Rose._                        Yea, when wilt begin?What, love rhymes, man? Fie on that deadly sin!_L. Mayor._ If you will have her, I’ll make her agree._Ham._ Enforced love is worse than hate to me.(_Aside._) There is a wench keeps shop in the Old Change,To her will I; it is not wealth I seek,I have enough, and will prefer her loveBefore the world.--(_Aloud._) My good lord mayor, adieu.Old love for me, I have no luck with new.      [_Exit.__L. Mayor._ Now, mammet,[60] you have well behaved yourself,But you shall curse your coyness if I live.--Who’s within there? See you convey your mistressStraight to th’Old Ford! I’ll keep you straight enough.Fore God, I would have sworn the puling girlWould willingly accepted Hammon’s love;But banish him, my thoughts!--Go, minion, in!      [_Exit_ ROSE.Now tell me, Master Scott, would you have thoughtThat Master Simon Eyre, the shoemaker,Had been of wealth to buy such merchandise?[60] Puppet: derived from Mahomet._Scott._ ’Twas well, my lord, your honour and myselfGrew partners with him; for your bills of ladingShew that Eyre’s gains in one commodityRise at the least to full three thousand poundBesides like gain in other merchandise._L. Mayor._ Well, he shall spend some of his thousands now,For I have sent for him to the Guildhall._Enter_ EYRE.See, where he comes.--Good morrow, Master Eyre._Eyre._ Poor Simon Eyre, my lord, your shoemaker._L. Mayor._ Well, well, it likes yourself to term you so._Enter_ DODGER.Now, Master Dodger, what’s the news with you?_Dodger._ I’d gladly speak in private to your honour._L. Mayor._ You shall, you shall.--Master Eyre and Master Scott,I have some business with this gentleman;I pray, let me entreat you to walk beforeTo the Guildhall; I’ll follow presently.Master Eyre, I hope ere noon to call you sheriff._Eyre._ I would not care, my lord, if you might call meKing of Spain.--Come, Master Scott.      [_Exeunt_ EYRE _and_ SCOTT._L. Mayor._ Now, Master Dodger, what’s the news you bring?_Dodger._ The Earl of Lincoln by me greets your lordship,And earnestly requests you, if you can,Inform him, where his nephew Lacy keeps._L. Mayor._ Is not his nephew Lacy now in France?_Dodger._ No, I assure your lordship, but disguisedLurks here in London._L. Mayor._           London? is’t even so?It may be; but upon my faith and soul,I know not where he lives, or whether he lives:So tell my Lord of Lincoln.--Lurks in London?Well, Master Dodger, you perhaps may start him;Be but the means to rid him into France,I’ll give you a dozen angels[61] for your pains:So much I love his honour, hate his nephew.And, prithee, so inform thy lord from me.[61] Coins worth about 10_s._ each._Dodger._ I take my leave.      [_Exit_ DODGER._L. Mayor._ Farewell, good Master Dodger,Lacy in London? I dare pawn my life,My daughter knows thereof, and for that causeDenied young Master Hammon in his love.Well, I am glad I sent her to Old Ford.Gods Lord, ’tis late; to Guildhall I must hie;I know my brethren stay my company.      [_Exit._SCENE IV.--_London: a Room in_ EYRE’S _House_._Enter_ FIRK, MARGERY, HANS, _and_ ROGER._Marg._ Thou goest too fast for me, Roger. O, Firk!_Firk._ Ay, forsooth._Marg._ I pray thee, run--do you hear?--run to Guildhall, andlearn if my husband, Master Eyre, will take that worshipfulvocation of Master Sheriff upon him. Hie thee, good Firk._Firk._ Take it? Well, I go; an’ he should not take it, Firkswears to forswear him. Yes, forsooth, I go to Guildhall._Marg._ Nay, when? thou art too compendious and tedious._Firk._ O rare, your excellence is full of eloquence; how like anew cart-wheel my dame speaks, and she looks like an old mustyale-bottle[62] going to scalding.[62] Ale-kegs, made of wood; hence the need for scalding._Marg._ Nay, when? thou wilt make me melancholy._Firk._ God forbid your worship should fall into that humour;--Irun. [_Exit.__Marg._ Let me see now, Roger and Hans._Hodge._ Ay, forsooth, dame--mistress I should say, but the oldterm so sticks to the roof of my mouth, I can hardly lick it off._Marg._ Even what thou wilt, good Roger; dame is a fair name forany honest Christian; but let that pass. How dost thou, Hans?_Hans._ _Mee tanck you, vro._[63][63] I thank you, mistress!_Marg._ Well, Hans and Roger, you see, God hath blest yourmaster, and, perdy, if ever he comes to be Master Sheriff ofLondon--as we are all mortal--you shall see, I will have someodd thing or other in a corner for you: I will not be yourback-friend; but let that pass. Hans, pray thee, tie my shoe._Hans._ _Yaw, ic sal, vro._[64][64] Yes, I shall, mistress!_Marg._ Roger, thou know’st the size of my foot; as it is noneof the biggest, so I thank God, it is handsome enough; prithee,let me have a pair of shoes made, cork, good Roger, wooden heeltoo.[65][65] High-heeled cork shoes were in fashion for ladies at thistime._Hodge._ You shall._Marg._ Art thou acquainted with never a farthingale-maker, nora French hood-maker? I must enlarge my bum, ha, ha! How shall Ilook in a hood, I wonder! Perdy,[66] oddly, I think.[66] Truly; see _ante_, p. 33._Hodge._ As a cat out of a pillory:[67] very well, I warrantyou, mistress.[67] A comparison suggested by the likeness of the flaps of thehood to the boards of a pillory, between which the head of theprisoner was fastened._Marg._ Indeed, all flesh is grass; and, Roger, canst thou tellwhere I may buy a good hair?_Hodge._ Yes, forsooth, at the poulterer’s in GraciousStreet.[68][68] The old name for Gracechurch Street before the fire ofLondon._Marg._ Thou art an ungracious wag; perdy, I mean a false hairfor my periwig._Hodge._ Why, mistress, the next time I cut my beard, you shallhave the shavings of it; but they are all true hairs._Marg._ It is very hot, I must get me a fan or else a mask._Hodge._ So you had need to hide your wicked face._Marg._ Fie, upon it, how costly this world’s calling is; perdy,but that it is one of the wonderful works of God, I would notdeal with it. Is not Firk come yet? Hans, be not so sad, let itpass and vanish, as my husband’s worship says._Hans._ _Ick bin vrolicke, lot see yow soo._[69][69] I am merry; let’s see you so too!_Hodge._ Mistress, will you drink a pipe of tobacco?_Marg._ Oh, fie upon it, Roger, perdy! These filthytobacco-pipes are the most idle slavering baubles that ever Ifelt. Out upon it! God bless us, men look not like men that usethem. _Enter_ RALPH, _lame_._Roger._ What, fellow Ralph? Mistress, look here, Jane’shusband! Why, how now, lame? Hans, make much of him, he’s abrother of our trade, a good workman, and a tall soldier._Hans._ You be welcome, broder._Marg._ Perdy, I knew him not. How dost thou, good Ralph? I amglad to see thee well._Ralph._ I would to God you saw me, dame, as wellAs when I went from London into France._Marg._ Trust me, I am sorry, Ralph, to see thee impotent. Lord,how the wars have made him sunburnt! The left leg is not well;’twas a fair gift of God the infirmity took not hold a littlehigher, considering thou camest from France; but let that pass._Ralph._ I am glad to see you well, and I rejoiceTo hear that God hath blest my master soSince my departure._Marg._ Yea, truly, Ralph, I thank my Maker; but let that pass._Hodge._ And, sirrah Ralph, what news, what news in France?_Ralph._ Tell me, good Roger, first, what news in England? Howdoes my Jane? When didst thou see my wife?Where lives my poor heart? She’ll be poor indeed,Now I want limbs to get whereon to feed._Hodge._ Limbs? Hast thou not hands, man? Thou shalt never see ashoemaker want bread, though he have but three fingers on a hand._Ralph._ Yet all this while I hear not of my Jane._Marg._ O Ralph, your wife,--perdy, we know not what’s becomeof her. She was here a while, and because she was married, grewmore stately than became her; I checked her, and so forth; awayshe flung, never returned, nor said bye nor bah; and, Ralph, youknow, “ka me, ka thee.”[70] And so, as I tell ye----Roger, isnot Firk come yet?[70] Serve me, and I’ll serve thee._Hodge._ No, forsooth._Marg._ And so, indeed, we heard not of her, but I hear shelives in London; but let that pass. If she had wanted, she mighthave opened her case to me or my husband, or to any of my men; Iam sure, there’s not any of them, perdy, but would have done hergood to his power. Hans, look if Firk be come._Hans._ _Yaw, ik sal, vro._[71] [_Exit_ HANS.[71] Yes, I shall, dame!_Marg._ And so, as I said--but, Ralph, why dost thou weep? Thouknowest that naked we came out of our mother’s womb, and nakedwe must return; and, therefore, thank God for all things._Hodge._ No, faith, Jane is a stranger here; but, Ralph, pull upa good heart, I know thou hast one. Thy wife, man, is in London;one told me, he saw her a while ago very brave and neat; we’llferret her out, an’ London hold her._Marg._ Alas, poor soul, he’s overcome with sorrow; he doesbut as I do, weep for the loss of any good thing. But, Ralph,get thee in, call for some meat and drink, thou shalt find meworshipful towards thee._Ralph._ I thank you, dame; since I want limbs and lands,I’ll trust to God, my good friends, and my hands.      [_Exit.__Enter_ HANS _and_ FIRK _running_._Firk._ Run, good Hans! O Hodge, O mistress! Hodge, heave upthine ears; mistress, smug up[72] your looks; on with yourbest apparel; my master is chosen, my master is called, nay,condemned by the cry of the country to be sheriff of thecity for this famous year now to come. And time now being, agreat many men in black gowns were asked for their voices andtheir hands and my master had all their fists about his earspresently, and they cried ‘Ay, ay, ay, ay,’--and so I came away--[72] Brighten up.Wherefore without all other grieveI do salute you, Mistress Shrieve.[73][73] Sheriff._Hans._ _Yaw, my mester is de groot man, de shrieve.__Hodge._ Did not I tell you, mistress? Now I may boldly say:Good-morrow to your worship._Marg._ Good-morrow, good Roger. I thank you, my good peopleall.--Firk, hold up thy hand: here’s a threepenny piece for thytidings._Firk._ ’Tis but three-half-pence, I think. Yes, ’tisthree-pence, I smell the rose.[74][74] “The three-farthing silver pieces of Queen Elizabeth hadthe profile of the sovereign with a rose at the back of herhead.”--_Dyce_ (Note to _King John_.)_Hodge._ But, mistress, be ruled by me, and do not speak sopulingly._Firk._ ’Tis her worship speaks so, and not she. No, faith,mistress, speak me in the old key: ‘To it, Firk,’ ‘there, goodFirk,’ ‘ply your business, Hodge,’ ‘Hodge, with a full mouth,’‘I’ll fill your bellies with good cheer, till they cry twang.’_Enter_ EYRE _wearing a gold chain_._Hans._ _See, myn liever broder, heer compt my meester.__Marg._ Welcome home, Master Shrieve; I pray God continue you inhealth and wealth._Eyre._ See here, my Maggy, a chain, a gold chain for SimonEyre. I shall make thee a lady; here’s a French hood for thee;on with it, on with it! dress thy brows with this flap of ashoulder of mutton,[75] to make thee look lovely. Where be myfine men? Roger, I’ll make over my shop and tools to thee; Firk,thou shalt be the foreman; Hans, thou shalt have an hundred fortwenty.[76] Be as mad knaves as your master Sim Eyre hath been,and you shall live to be Sheriffs of London.--How dost thou likeme, Margery? Prince am I none, yet am I princely born. Firk,Hodge, and Hans![75] The flap of a hood trimmed with fur or sheep’s wool.[76] _i.e._ For the twenty Portuguese previously lent._All three._ Ay forsooth, what says your worship, Master Sheriff?_Eyre._ Worship and honour, you Babylonian knaves, for thegentle craft. But I forgot myself, I am bidden by my lord mayorto dinner to Old Ford; he’s gone before, I must after. Come,Madge, on with your trinkets! Now, my true Trojans, my fineFirk, my dapper Hodge, my honest Hans, some device, some oddcrotchets, some morris, or such like, for the honour of thegentlemen shoemakers. Meet me at Old Ford, you know my mind.Come, Madge, away. Shut up the shop, knaves, and make holiday.[_Exeunt.__Firk._ O rare! O brave! Come, Hodge; follow me, Hans;We’ll be with them for a morris-dance.      [_Exeunt._SCENE V.--_A Room at Old Ford.__Enter the_ LORD MAYOR, ROSE, EYRE, MARGERY _in a French hood_, SYBIL,_and other_ Servants._L. Mayor._ Trust me, you are as welcome to Old FordAs I myself._Marg._ Truly, I thank your lordship._L. Mayor._ Would our bad cheer were worth the thanks you give._Eyre._ Good cheer, my lord mayor, fine cheer! A fine house,fine walls, all fine and neat._L. Mayor._ Now, by my troth, I’ll tell thee, Master Eyre,It does me good, and all my brethren,That such a madcap fellow as thyselfIs entered into our society._Marg._ Ay, but, my lord, he must learn now to put on gravity._Eyre._ Peace, Maggy, a fig for gravity! When I go to Guildhallin my scarlet gown, I’ll look as demurely as a saint, and speakas gravely as a justice of peace; but now I am here at Old Ford,at my good lord mayor’s house, let it go by, vanish, Maggy, I’llbe merry; away with flip-flap, these fooleries, these gulleries.What, honey? Prince am I none, yet am I princely born. What saysmy lord mayor?_L. Mayor._ Ha, ha, ha! I had rather than a thousand pound, Ihad an heart but half so light as yours._Eyre._ Why, what should I do, my lord? A pound of care pays nota dram of debt. Hum, let’s be merry, whiles we are young; oldage, sack and sugar will steal upon us, ere we be aware.[77][77] Herrick, who was a goldsmith’s apprentice in Londonduring the time when this play was performed, seems to haveappropriated these words of Eyre’s, and turned them into rhymein these lines:--“Let’s now take our time,While we’re in our prime,  And old, old age is afar off;For the evil, evil days,Will come on apace,  Before we can be aware of.”THE FIRST THREE-MEN’S SONG.[78][78] A song or catch for three voices. In the original, the twoThree-Men’s Songs are printed separately from the rest of theplay, and the place for their insertion is only very uncertainlyindicated.O the month of May, the merry month of May,  So frolick, so gay, and so green, so green, so green!O, and then did I unto my true love say:  “Sweet Peg, thou shalt be my summer’s queen!“Now the nightingale, the pretty nightingale,  The sweetest singer in all the forest’s choir,Entreats thee, sweet Peggy, to hear thy true love’s tale;  Lo, yonder she sitteth, her breast against a brier.“But O, I spy the cuckoo, the cuckoo, the cuckoo;  See where she sitteth: come away, my joy;Come away, I prithee: I do not like the cuckoo  Should sing where my Peggy and I kiss and toy.”O the month of May, the merry month of May,  So frolick, so gay, and so green, so green, so green!And then did I unto my true love say:  “Sweet Peg, thou shalt be my summer’s queen!”_L. Mayor._ It’s well done; Mistress Eyre, pray, give good counselTo my daughter._Marg._ I hope, Mistress Rose will have the grace to takenothing that’s bad._L. Mayor._ Pray God she do; for i’ faith, Mistress Eyre,I would bestow upon that peevish girlA thousand marks more than I mean to give her,Upon condition she’d be ruled by me;The ape still crosseth me. There came of lateA proper gentleman of fair revenues,Whom gladly I would call son-in-law:But my fine cockney would have none of him.You’ll prove a coxcomb for it, ere you die:A courtier, or no man must please your eye._Eyre._ Be ruled, sweet Rose: th’art ripe for a man. Marrynot with a boy that has no more hair on his face than thouhast on thy cheeks. A courtier, wash, go by, stand not uponpishery-pashery: those silken fellows are but painted images,outsides, outsides, Rose; their inner linings are torn. No, myfine mouse, marry me with a gentleman grocer like my lord mayor,your father; a grocer is a sweet trade: plums, plums. Had I ason or daughter should marry out of the generation and bloodof the shoemakers, he should pack; what, the gentle trade is aliving for a man through Europe, through the world. [_A noisewithin of a tabor and a pipe.__L. Mayor._ What noise is this?_Eyre._ O my lord mayor, a crew of good fellows that for loveto your honour are come hither with a morris-dance. Come in, myMesopotamians, cheerily._Enter_ HODGE, HANS, RALPH,FIRK, _and other ~Shoemakers~, in a morris; after alittle dancing the_ LORD MAYOR _speaks_._L. Mayor._ Master Eyre, are all these shoemakers?_Eyre._ All cordwainers, my good lord mayor._Rose._ (_Aside._) How like my Lacy looks yond’ shoemaker!_Hans._ (_Aside._) O that I durst but speak unto my love!_L. Mayor._ Sybil, go fetch some wine to make these drink. Youare all welcome._All._ We thank your lordship. [ROSE _takes a cup ofwine and goes to_ HANS._Rose._ For his sake whose fair shape thou represent’st,Good friend, I drink to thee._Hans._ _Ic bedancke, good frister._[79][79] I thank you, good maid!_Marg._ I see, Mistress Rose, you do not want judgment; you havedrunk to the properest man I keep._Firk._ Here be some have done their parts to be as proper as he._L. Mayor._ Well, urgent business calls me back to London:Good fellows, first go in and taste our cheer;And to make merry as you homeward go,Spend these two angels[80] in beer at Stratford-Bow.[80] See note _ante_, p. 39._Eyre._ To these two, my mad lads, Sim Eyre adds another; thencheerily, Firk; tickle it, Hans, and all for the honour ofshoemakers. [_All go dancing out.__L. Mayor._ Come, Master Eyre, let’s have your company.[_Exeunt.__Rose._ Sybil, what shall I do?_Sybil._ Why, what’s the matter?_Rose._ That Hans the shoemaker is my love Lacy,Disguised in that attire to find me out.How should I find the means to speak with him?_Sybil._ What, mistress, never fear; I dare venture mymaidenhead to nothing, and that’s great odds, that Hans theDutchman, when we come to London, shall not only see and speakwith you, but in spite of all your father’s policies steal youaway and marry you. Will not this please you?_Rose._ Do this, and ever be assured of my love._Sybil._ Away, then, and follow your father to London, lest yourabsence cause him to suspect something:To morrow, if my counsel be obeyed,I’ll bind you prentice to the gentle trade.      [_Exeunt._ACT THE FOURTH.SCENE I.--_A Street in London._JANE _in a Seamster’s shop, working; enter ~Master~_ HAMMON, _muffled;he stands aloof_.Ham. Yonder’s the shop, and there my fair love sits.She’s fair and lovely, but she is not mine.O, would she were! Thrice have I courted her,Thrice hath my hand been moistened with her hand,Whilst my poor famished eyes do feed on thatWhich made them famish. I am unfortunate:I still love one, yet nobody loves me.I muse, in other men what women see,That I so want! Fine Mistress Rose was coy,And this too curious! Oh, no, she is chaste,And for she thinks me wanton, she deniesTo cheer my cold heart with her sunny eyes.How prettily she works, oh pretty hand!Oh happy work! It doth me good to standUnseen to see her. Thus I oft have stoodIn frosty evenings, a light burning by her,Enduring biting cold, only to eye her.One only look hath seemed as rich to meAs a king’s crown; such is love’s lunacy.Muffled I’ll pass along, and by that tryWhether she know me._Jane._              Sir, what is’t you buy?What is’t you lack, sir, calico, or lawn,Fine cambric shirts, or bands, what will you buy?_Ham._ (_Aside._) That which thou wilt not sell. Faith, yet I’ll try:How do you sell this handkerchief?_Jane._                            Good cheap._Ham._ And how these ruffs?_Jane._                     Cheap too._Ham._                                 And how this band?_Jane._ Cheap too._Ham._             All cheap; how sell you then this hand?_Jane._ My hands are not to be sold._Ham._                               To be given then!Nay, faith, I come to buy._Jane._                    But none knows when._Ham._ Good sweet, leave work a little while; let’s play._Jane._ I cannot live by keeping holiday._Ham._ I’ll pay you for the time which shall be lost._Jane._ With me you shall not be at so much cost._Ham._ Look, how you wound this cloth, so you woundme._Jane._ It may be so._Ham._                ’Tis so._Jane._                        What remedy?_Ham._ Nay, faith, you are too coy._Jane._                             Let go my hand._Ham._ I will do any task at your command,I would let go this beauty, were I notIn mind to disobey you by a powerThat controls kings: I love you!_Jane._                          So, now part._Ham._ With hands I may, but never with my heart.In faith, I love you._Jane._               I believe you do._Ham._ Shall a true love in me breed hate in you?_Jane._ I hate you not._Ham._                  Then you must love?_Jane._                                     I do.What are you better now? I love not you._Ham._ All this, I hope, is but a woman’s fray,That means: come to me, when she cries: away!In earnest, mistress, I do not jest,A true chaste love hath entered in my breast.I love you dearly, as I love my life,I love you as a husband loves a wife;That, and no other love, my love requires,Thy wealth, I know, is little; my desiresThirst not for gold. Sweet, beauteous Jane, what’s mineShall, if thou make myself thine, all be thine.Say, judge, what is thy sentence, life or death?Mercy or cruelty lies in thy breath._Jane._ Good sir, I do believe you love me well;For ’tis a silly conquest, silly prideFor one like you--I mean a gentleman--To boast that by his love-tricks he hath broughtSuch and such women to his amorous lure;I think you do not so, yet many do,And make it even a very trade to woo.I could be coy, as many women be,Feed you with sunshine smiles and wanton looks,But I detest witchcraft; say that IDo constantly believe, you constant have----_Ham._ Why dost thou not believe me?_Jane._                              I believe you;But yet, good sir, because I will not grieve youWith hopes to taste fruit which will never fall,In simple truth this is the sum of all:My husband lives, at least, I hope he lives.Pressed was he to these bitter wars in France;Bitter they are to me by wanting him.I have but one heart, and that heart’s his due.How can I then bestow the same on you?Whilst he lives, his I live, be it ne’er so poor,And rather be his wife than a king’s whore._Ham._ Chaste and dear woman, I will not abuse thee,Although it cost my life, if thou refuse me.Thy husband, pressed for France, what was his name?_Jane._ Ralph Damport._Ham._                 Damport?--Here’s a letter sentFrom France to me, from a dear friend of mine,A gentleman of place; here he doth writeTheir names that have been slain in every fight._Jane._ I hope death’s scroll contains not my love’s name._Ham._ Cannot you read?_Jane._                 I can._Ham._                         Peruse the same.To my remembrance such a name I readAmongst the rest. See here._Jane._                     Ay me, he’s dead!He’s dead! if this be true, my dear heart’s slain!_Ham._ Have patience, dear love._Jane._                          Hence, hence!_Ham._                                         Nay, sweet Jane,Make not poor sorrow proud with these rich tears.I mourn thy husband’s death, because thou mourn’st._Jane._ That bill is forged; ’tis signed by forgery._Ham._ I’ll bring thee letters sent besides to many,Carrying the like report: Jane, ’tis too true.Come, weep not: mourning, though it rise from love,Helps not the mourned, yet hurts them that mourn._Jane._ For God’s sake, leave me._Ham._                            Whither dost thou turn?Forget the dead, love them that are alive;His love is faded, try how mine will thrive._Jane._ ’Tis now no time for me to think on love._Ham._ ’Tis now best time for you to think on love,Because your love lives not._Jane._                      Though he be dead,My love to him shall not be buried;For God’s sake, leave me to myself alone._Ham._ ’Twould kill my soul, to leave thee drowned in moan.Answer me to my suit, and I am gone;Say to me yea or no._Jane._              No._Ham._                   Then farewell!One farewell will not serve, I come again;Come, dry these wet cheeks; tell me, faith, sweet Jane,Yea or no, once more._Jane._               Once more I say: no;Once more be gone, I pray; else will I go._Ham._ Nay, then I will grow rude, by this white hand,Until you change that cold “no”; here I’ll standTill by your hard heart----_Jane._                     Nay, for God’s love, peace!My sorrows by your presence more increase.Not that you thus are present, but all griefDesires to be alone; therefore in briefThus much I say, and saying bid adieu:If ever I wed man, it shall be you._Ham._ O blessed voice! Dear Jane, I’ll urge no more,Thy breath hath made me rich._Jane._                       Death makes me poor.

How say’st thou, Hans, doth notFirk tickle it?_Hans._ _Yaw, mester.__Firk._ Not so neither, my organ-pipe squeaks this morning forwant of liquoring. Hey, down a down, derry!_Hans._ _Forward, Firk, tow best un jolly yongster. Hort, I,mester, ic bid yo, cut me un pair vampres vor Mester Jeffre’sboots._[81][81] “Forward, Firk, thou art a jolly youngster. Hark, ay,master, I bid you cut me a pair of vamps for Master Jeffrey’sboots.” Vamps; upper leathers of a shoe._Hodge._ Thou shalt, Hans._Firk._ Master!_Hodge._ How now, boy?_Firk._ Pray, now you are in the cutting vein, cut me out a pairof counterfeits,[82] or else my work will not pass current; hey,down a down![82] A play upon “vamps,” which sometimes has this meaning._Hodge._ Tell me, sirs, are my cousin Mrs. Priscilla’s shoesdone?_Firk._ Your cousin? No, master; one of your aunts, hang her;let them alone._Ralph._ I am in hand with them; she gave charge that none but Ishould do them for her._Firk._ Thou do for her? then ’twill be a lame doing, and thatshe loves not. Ralph, thou might’st have sent her to me, infaith, I would have yearked and firked your Priscilla. Hey, downa down, derry. This gear will not hold._Hodge._ How say’st thou, Firk, were we not merry at Old Ford?_Firk._ How, merry? why, our buttocks went jiggy-joggy like aquagmire. Well, Sir Roger Oatmeal, if I thought all meal ofthat nature, I would eat nothing but bagpuddings._Ralph._ Of all good fortunes my fellow Hans had the best._Firk._ ’Tis true, because Mistress Rose drank to him._Hodge._ Well, well, work apace. They say, seven of the aldermenbe dead, or very sick._Firk._ I care not, I’ll be none._Ralph._ No, nor I; but then my Master Eyre will come quickly tobe lord mayor._Enter_ SYBIL._Firk._ Whoop, yonder comes Sybil._Hodge._ Sybil, welcome, i’faith; and how dost thou, mad wench?_Firk._ Syb-whore, welcome to London._Sybil._ Godamercy, sweet Firk; good lord, Hodge, what adelicious shop you have got! You tickle it, i’faith._Ralph._ Godamercy, Sybil, for our good cheer at Old Ford._Sybil._ That you shall have, Ralph._Firk._ Nay, by the mass, we had tickling cheer, Sybil; and howthe plague dost thou and Mistress Rose and my lord mayor? I putthe women in first._Sybil._ Well, Godamercy; but God’s me, I forget myself, where’sHans the Fleming?_Firk._ Hark, butter-box, now you must yelp out some _spreken_._Hans._ _Wat begaie you? Vat vod you, Frister?_[83][83] What do you want (was begehrt ihr), what would you, girl?_Sybil._ Marry, you must come to my young mistress, to pull onher shoes you made last._Hans._ _Vare ben your egle fro, vare ben your mistris?_[84][84] Where is your noble lady, where is your mistress?_Sybil._ Marry, here at our London house in Cornhill._Firk._ Will nobody serve her turn but Hans?_Sybil._ No, sir. Come, Hans, I stand upon needles._Hodge._ Why then, Sybil, take heed of pricking._Sybil._ For that let me alone. I have a trick in my budget.Come, Hans._Hans._ _Yaw, yaw, ic sall meete yo gane._[85] [_Exit_HANS _and_ SYBIL.[85] Yes, yes, I shall go with you._Hodge._ Go, Hans, make haste again. Come, who lacks work?_Firk._ I, master, for I lack my breakfast; ’tis munching-time,and past._Hodge._ Is’t so? why, then leave work, Ralph. To breakfast!Boy, look to the tools. Come, Ralph; come, Firk. [_Exeunt._SCENE III.--_The Same.__Enter a ~Serving-man~.__Serv._ Let me see now, the sign of the Last in Tower Street.Mass, yonder’s the house. What, haw! Who’s within?_Enter_ RALPH._Ralph._ Who calls there? What want you, sir?_Serv._ Marry, I would have a pair of shoes made for agentlewoman against to-morrow morning. What, can you do them?_Ralph._ Yes, sir, you shall have them. But what length’s herfoot?_Serv._ Why, you must make them in all parts like this shoe;but, at any hand, fail not to do them, for the gentlewoman is tobe married very early in the morning._Ralph._ How? by this shoe must it be made? by this? Are yousure, sir, by this?_Serv._ How, by this? Am I sure, by this? Art thou in thy wits?I tell thee, I must have a pair of shoes dost thou mark me?a pair of shoes, two shoes, made by this very shoe, this sameshoe, against to-morrow morning by four a clock. Dost understandme? Canst thou do’t?_Ralph._ Yes, sir, yes--I--I--I can do’t. By this shoe, you say?I should know this shoe. Yes, sir, yes, by this shoe, I cando’t. Four a clock, well. Whither shall I bring them?_Serv._ To the sign of the Golden Ball in Watling Street;enquire for one Master Hammon, a gentleman, my master._Ralph._ Yea, sir; by this shoe, you say?_Serv._ I say, Master Hammon at the Golden Ball; he’s thebridegroom, and those shoes are for his bride._Ralph._ They shall be done by this shoe; well, well, MasterHammon at the Golden Shoe--I would say, the Golden Ball; verywell, very well. But I pray you, sir, where must Master Hammonbe married?_Serv._ At Saint Faith’s Church, under Paul’s.[86] But what’sthat to thee? Prithee, dispatch those shoes, and so farewell.[_Exit._[86] “At the west end of this Jesus chapel, under the choir ofPaul’s, also was a parish church of St. Faith, commonly calledSt. Faith under Paul’s.”--_Stow.__Ralph._ By this shoe, said he. How am I amazedAt this strange accident! Upon my life,This was the very shoe I gave my wife,When I was pressed for France; since when, alas!I never could hear of her: it is the same,And Hammon’s bride no other but my Jane._Enter_ FIRK._Firk._ ’Snails,[87] Ralph, thou hast lost thy part of threepots, a countryman of mine gave me to breakfast.[87] A corruption of “God’s nails.”_Ralph._ I care not; I have found a better thing._Firk._ A thing? away! Is it a man’s thing, or a woman’s thing?_Ralph._ Firk, dost thou know this shoe?_Firk._ No, by my troth; neither doth that know me! I have noacquaintance with it, ’tis a mere stranger to me._Ralph._ Why, then I do; this shoe, I durst be sworn,Once covered the instep of my Jane.This is her size, her breadth, thus trod my love;These true-love knots I pricked; I hold my life,By this old shoe I shall find out my wife._Firk._ Ha, ha! Old shoe, that wert new! How a murrain came thisague-fit of foolishness upon thee?_Ralph._ Thus, Firk: even now here came a serving-man;By this shoe would he have a new pair madeAgainst to-morrow morning for his mistress,That’s to be married to a gentleman.And why may not this be my sweet Jane?_Firk._ And why may’st not thou be my sweet ass? Ha, ha!_Ralph._ Well, laugh and spare not! But the truth is this:Against to-morrow morning I’ll provideA lusty crew of honest shoemakers,To watch the going of the bride to church.If she prove Jane, I’ll take her in despiteFrom Hammon and the devil, were he by.If it be not my Jane, what remedy?Hereof I am sure, I shall live till I die,Although I never with a woman lie.      [_Exit.__Firk._ Thou lie with a woman to build nothing butCripple-gates! Well, God sends fools fortune, and it may be, hemay light upon his matrimony by such a device; for wedding andhanging goes by destiny. [_Exit._SCENE IV.--_London: a Room in the_ LORD MAYOR’S _House_._Enter_ HANS _and_ ROSE, _arm in arm_._Hans._ How happy am I by embracing thee!Oh, I did fear such cross mishaps did reign,That I should never see my Rose again._Rose._ Sweet Lacy, since fair opportunityOffers herself to further our escape,Let not too over-fond esteem of meHinder that happy hour. Invent the means,And Rose will follow thee through all the world._Hans._ Oh, how I surfeit with excess of joy,Made happy by thy rich perfection!But since thou pay’st sweet interest to my hopes,Redoubling love on love, let me once moreLike to a bold-faced debtor crave of thee,This night to steal abroad, and at Eyre’s house,Who now by death of certain aldermenIs mayor of London, and my master once,Meet thou thy Lacy, where in spite of change,Your father’s anger, and mine uncle’s hate,Our happy nuptials will we consummate._Enter_ SYBIL._Sybil._ Oh God, what will you do, mistress? Shift for yourself,your father is at hand! He’s coming, he’s coming! MasterLacy, hide yourself in my mistress! For God’s sake, shift foryourselves!_Hans._ Your hither come, sweet Rose--what shall I do? Whereshall I hide me? How shall I escape?_Rose._ A man, and want wit in extremity? Come, come, be Hansstill, play the shoemaker, Pull on my shoe._Enter the_ LORD MAYOR._Hans._ Mass, and that’s well remembered._Sybil._ Here comes your father._Hans._ _Forware, metresse, ’tis un good skow, it sal vel dute,or ye sal neit betallen._[88][88] Indeed, mistress, ’tis a good shoe, it shall fit well, oryou shall not pay._Rose._ Oh God, it pincheth me; what will you do?_Hans._ (_Aside._) Your father’s presence pincheth, not the shoe._L. Mayor._ Well done; fit my daughter well, and she shallplease thee well._Hans._ _Yaw, yaw, ick weit dat well; forware, ’tis un goodskoo, ’tis gimait van neits leither; se euer, mine here._[89][89] Yes, yes, I know that well; indeed, ’tis a good shoe, ’tismade of neat’s leather, see here, good sir!_Enter a ~Prentice~.__L. Mayor._ I do believe it.--What’s the news with you?_Prentice._ Please you, the Earl of Lincoln at the gateIs newly ’lighted, and would speak with you._L. Mayor._ The Earl of Lincoln come to speak with me?Well, well, I know his errand. Daughter Rose,Send hence your shoemaker, dispatch, have done!Syb, make things handsome! Sir boy, follow me.      [_Exit.__Hans._ Mine uncle come! Oh, what may this portend?Sweet Rose, this of our love threatens an end._Rose._ Be not dismayed at this; whate’er befall,Rose is thine own. To witness I speak truth,Where thou appoint’st the place, I’ll meet with thee.I will not fix a day to follow thee,But presently steal hence. Do not reply:Love which gave strength to bear my father’s hate,Shall now add wings to further our escape.      [_Exeunt._SCENE V.--_Another Room in the same House.__Enter the_ LORD MAYOR _and the_ EARL OF LINCOLN._L. Mayor._ Believe me, on my credit, I speak truth:Since first your nephew Lacy went to France,I have not seen him. It seemed strange to me,When Dodger told me that he stayed behind,Neglecting the high charge the king imposed._Lincoln._ Trust me, Sir Roger Oateley, I did thinkYour counsel had given head to this attempt,Drawn to it by the love he bears your child.Here I did hope to find him in your house;But now I see mine error, and confess,My judgment wronged you by conceiving so._L. Mayor._ Lodge in my house, say you? Trust me, my lord,I love your nephew Lacy too too dearly,So much to wrong his honour; and he hath done so,That first gave him advice to stay from France.To witness I speak truth, I let you know,How careful I have been to keep my daughterFree from all conference or speech of him;Not that I scorn your nephew, but in loveI bear your honour, lest your noble bloodShould by my mean worth be dishonoured._Lincoln._ [_Aside._] How far the churl’s tongue wanders from his heart!Well, well, Sir Roger Oateley, I believe you,With more than many thanks for the kind love,So much you seem to bear me. But, my lord,Let me request your help to seek my nephew,Whom if I find, I’ll straight embark for France.So shall your Rose be free, my thoughts at rest,And much care die which now lies in my breast._Enter_ SYBIL._Sybil._ Oh Lord! Help, for God’s sake! my mistress; oh, myyoung mistress!_L. Mayor._ Where is thy mistress? What’s become of her?_Sybil._ She’s gone, she’s fled!_L. Mayor._ Gone! Whither is she fled?_Sybil._ I know not, forsooth; she’s fled out of doors with Hansthe shoemaker; I saw them scud, scud, scud, apace, apace!_L. Mayor._ Which way? What, John! Where be my men? Which way?_Sybil._ I know not, an it please your worship._L. Mayor._ Fled with a shoemaker? Can this be true?_Sybil._ Oh Lord, sir, as true as God’s in Heaven._Lincoln._ Her love turned shoemaker? I am glad of this._L. Mayor._ A Fleming butter-box, a shoemaker!Will she forget her birth, requite my careWith such ingratitude? Scorned she young HammonTo love a honniken,[90] a needy knave?Well, let her fly, I’ll not fly after her,Let her starve, if she will; she’s none of mine.[90] Honeykin (?); poor honey, poor creature._Lincoln._ Be not so cruel, sir._Enter_ FIRK _with shoes_._Sybil._                         I am glad, she’s ’scaped._L. Mayor._ I’ll not account of her as of my child.Was there no better object for her eyesBut a foul drunken lubber, swill-belly,A shoemaker? That’s brave!_Firk._ Yea, forsooth; ’tis a very brave shoe, and as fit as apudding._L. Mayor._ How now, what knave is this? From whence comestthou?_Firk._ No knave, sir. I am Firk the shoemaker, lusty Roger’schief lusty journeyman, and I have come hither to take up thepretty leg of sweet Mistress Rose, and thus hoping your worshipis in as good health, as I was at the making hereof, I bid youfarewell, yours, Firk._L. Mayor._ Stay, stay, Sir Knave!_Lincoln._ Come hither, shoemaker!_Firk._ ’Tis happy the knave is put before the shoemaker, orelse I would not have vouchsafed to come back to you. I ammoved, for I stir._L. Mayor._ My lord, this villain calls us knaves by craft._Firk._ Then ’tis by the gentle craft, and to call one knavegently, is no harm. Sit your worship merry![91] Syb, your youngmistress--I’ll so bob them, now my Master Eyre is lord mayor ofLondon.[91] “Rest you merry.”--_Shak._, Romeo and Juliet, ActI, Sc. 2._L. Mayor._ Tell me, sirrah, who’s man are you?_Firk._ I am glad to see your worship so merry. I have no maw tothis gear, no stomach as yet to a red petticoat. [_Pointing to_SYBIL._Lincoln._ He means not, sir, to woo you to his maid, But onlydoth demand who’s man you are._Firk._ I sing now to the tune of Rogero. Roger, my fellow, isnow my master._Lincoln._ Sirrah, know’st thou one Hans, a shoemaker?_Firk._ Hans, shoemaker? Oh yes, stay, yes, I have him. I tellyou what, I speak it in secret: Mistress Rose and he are bythis time--no, not so, but shortly are to come over one anotherwith “Can you dance the shaking of the sheets?” It is thatHans--(_Aside._) I’ll so gull these diggers![92][92] _i.e._ Diggers for information._L. Mayor._ Know’st thou, then, where he is?_Firk._ Yes, forsooth; yea, marry!_Lincoln._ Canst thou, in sadness----_Firk._ No, forsooth; no, marry!_L. Mayor._ Tell me, good honest fellow, where he is, And thoushalt see what I’ll bestow on thee._Firk._ Honest fellow? No, sir; not so, sir; my profession isthe gentle craft; I care not for seeing, I love feeling; letme feel it here; _aurium tenus_, ten pieces of gold; _genuumtenus_, ten pieces of silver; and then Firk is your man in a newpair of stretchers.[93][93] _i.e._ Stretchers of the truth, fibs._L. Mayor._ Here is an angel, part of thy reward, Which I willgive thee; tell me where he is._Firk._ No point! Shall I betray my brother? no! Shall I proveJudas to Hans? no! Shall I cry treason to my corporation? no, Ishall be firked and yerked then. But give me your angel; yourangel shall tell you._Lincoln._ Do so, good fellow; ’tis no hurt to thee._Firk._ Send simpering Syb away._L. Mayor._ Huswife, get you in. [_Exit_ SYBIL._Firk._ Pitchers have ears, and maids have wide mouths; butfor Hans Prauns, upon my word, to-morrow morning he and youngMistress Rose go to this gear, they shall be married together,by this rush, or else turn Firk to a firkin of butter, to tanleather withal._L. Mayor._ But art thou sure of this?_Firk._ Am I sure that Paul’s steeple is a handful higher thanLondon Stone,[94] or that the Pissing-Conduit[95] leaks nothingbut pure Mother Bunch? Am I sure I am lusty Firk? God’s nails,do you think I am so base to gull you?[94] A stone in St. Swithin’s (now cased in the wall of thechurch), which marked the centre from which the old Roman-roadsradiated.[95] A small conduit near the Royal Exchange._Lincoln._ Where are they married? Dost thou know the church._Firk._ I never go to church, but I know the name of it; it isa swearing church--stay a while, ’tis--ay, by the mass, no,no,--’tis--ay, by my troth, no, nor that; ’tis--ay, by myfaith, that, that, ’tis, ay, by my Faith’s Church under Paul’sCross. There they shall be knit like a pair of stockings inmatrimony; there they’ll be inconie.[96][96] A pretty sight. See p, 74, l. 1. Compare Shakespeare’s“Love’s Labour’s Lost,” Act III., Sc. 1, 136, and Act IV., Sc.1, 144._Lincoln._ Upon my life, my nephew Lacy walksIn the disguise of this Dutch shoemaker._Firk._ Yes, forsooth._Lincoln._ Doth he not, honest fellow?_Firk._ No, forsooth; I think Hans is nobody butHans, no spirit._L. Mayor._ My mind misgives me now, ’tis so, indeed._Lincoln._ My cousin speaks the language, knows the trade._L. Mayor._ Let me request your company, my lord;Your honourable presence may, no doubt,Refrain their headstrong rashness, when myselfGoing alone perchance may be o’erborne.Shall I request this favour?_Lincoln._                   This, or what else._Firk._ Then you must rise betimes, for they mean to fall totheir hey-pass and repass, pindy-pandy, which hand will youhave,[97] very early.[97] Terms used in a common children’s game, the point being todiscover in which of the two hands some small object was hidden._L. Mayor._ My care shall every way equal their haste.This night accept your lodging in my house,The earlier shall we stir, and at Saint Faith’sPrevent this giddy hare-brained nuptial.This traffic of hot love shall yield cold gains:They ban our loves, and we’ll forbid their banns.      [_Exit.__Lincoln._ At Saint Faith’s Church thou say’st?_Firk._ Yes, by their troth._Lincoln._ Be secret, on thy life. [_Exit.__Firk._ Yes, when I kiss your wife! Ha, ha, here’s no craft inthe gentle craft. I came hither of purpose with shoes to SirRoger’s worship, whilst Rose, his daughter, be cony-catched byHans. Soft now; these two gulls will be at Saint Faith’s Churchto-morrow morning, to take Master Bridegroom and Mistress Bridenapping, and they, in the mean time, shall chop up the matter atthe Savoy. But the best sport is, Sir Roger Oateley will find myfellow lame Ralph’s wife going to marry a gentleman, and thenhe’ll stop her instead of his daughter. Oh brave! there will befine tickling sport. Soft now, what have I to do? Oh, I know;now a mess of shoemakers meet at the Woolsack in Ivy Lane, tocozen my gentleman of lame Ralph’s wife, that’s true.Alack, alack!Girls, hold out tack!For now smocks for this jumblingShall go to wrack.      [_Exit._ACT THE FIFTH.SCENE I.--_A Room in_ EYRE’S _House_._Enter_ EYRE, MARGERY, HANS, _and_ ROSE.EYRE. This is the morning, then; stay, my bully, my honest Hans,is it not?_Hans._ This is the morning that must make us two happy ormiserable; therefore, if you----_Eyre._ Away with these ifs and ands, Hans, and these etcaeteras! By mine honour, Rowland Lacy, none but the king shallwrong thee. Come, fear nothing, am not I Sim Eyre? Is not SimEyre lord mayor of London? Fear nothing, Rose: let them all saywhat they can; dainty, come thou to me--laughest thou?_Marg._ Good my lord, stand her friend in what thing you may._Eyre._ Why, my sweet Lady Madgy, think you Simon Eyre canforget his fine Dutch journeyman? No, vah! Fie, I scorn it,it shall never be cast in my teeth, that I was unthankful.Lady Madgy, thou had’st never covered thy Saracen’s head withthis French flap, nor loaden thy bum with this farthingale,(’tis trash, trumpery, vanity); Simon Eyre had never walkedin a red petticoat, nor wore a chain of gold, but for my finejourneyman’s Portuguese.--And shall I leave him? No! Prince am Inone, yet bear a princely mind._Hans._ My lord, ’tis time for us to part from hence._Eyre._ Lady Madgy, Lady Madgy, take two or three of my piecrust-eaters, my buff-jerkin varlets, that do walk in blackgowns at Simon Eyre’s heels; take them, good Lady Madgy; tripand go, my brown queen of periwigs, with my delicate Rose andmy jolly Rowland to the Savoy; see them linked, countenancethe marriage; and when it is done, cling, cling together, youHamborow turtle-doves. I’ll bear you out, come to Simon Eyre;come, dwell with me, Hans, thou shalt eat minced-pies andmarchpane.[98] Rose, away, cricket; trip and go, my Lady Madgy,to the Savoy; Hans, wed, and to bed; kiss, and away! Go, vanish![98] A sweet biscuit, similar to a macaroon.--_Nares.__Marg._ Farewell, my lord._Rose._ Make haste, sweet love._Marg._                         She’d fain the deed were done._Hans._ Come, my sweet Rose; faster than deer we’ll run.[_Exeunt_ HANS, ROSE, _and_ MARGERY._Eyre._ Go, vanish, vanish! Avaunt, I say! By the Lord ofLudgate, it’s a mad life to be a lord mayor; it’s a stirringlife, a fine life, a velvet life, a careful life. Well, SimonEyre, yet set a good face on it, in the honour of Saint Hugh.Soft, the king this day comes to dine with me, to see my newbuildings; his majesty is welcome, he shall have good cheer,delicate cheer, princely cheer. This day, my fellow prenticesof London come to dine with me too, they shall have fine cheer,gentlemanlike cheer. I promised the mad Cappadocians, when weall served at the Conduit together, that if ever I came tobe mayor of London, I would feast them all, and I’ll do’t,I’ll do’t, by the life of Pharaoh; by this beard, Sim Eyrewill be no flincher. Besides, I have procured that upon everyShrove-Tuesday, at the sound of the pancake bell, my fine dapperAssyrian lads shall clap up their shop windows, and away. Thisis the day, and this day they shall do’t, they shall do’t.Boys, that day are you free, let masters care,And prentices shall pray for Simon Eyre.      [_Exit._SCENE II.--_A Street near St. Faith’s Church.__Enter_ HODGE, FIRK, RALPH, _and five or six ~Shoemakers~, all withcudgels or such weapons_._Hodge._ Come, Ralph; stand to it, Firk. My masters, as we arethe brave bloods of the shoemakers, heirs apparent to SaintHugh, and perpetual benefactors to all good fellows, thou shalthave no wrong; were Hammon a king of spades, he should not delvein thy close without thy sufferance. But tell me, Ralph, artthou sure ’tis thy wife?_Ralph._ Am I sure this is Firk? This morning, when Istroked[99] on her shoes, I looked upon her, and she upon me,and sighed, asked me if ever I knew one Ralph. Yes, said I. Forhis sake, said she--tears standing in her eyes--and for thou artsomewhat like him, spend this piece of gold. I took it; my lameleg and my travel beyond sea made me unknown. All is one forthat: I know she’s mine.[99] Fitted._Firk._ Did she give thee this gold? O glorious glittering gold!She’s thine own, ’tis thy wife, and she loves thee; for I’llstand to’t, there’s no woman will give gold to any man, but shethinks better of him, than she thinks of them she gives silverto. And for Hammon, neither Hammon nor hangman shall wrong theein London. Is not our old master Eyre, lord mayor? Speak, myhearts._All._ Yes, and Hammon shall know it to his cost._Enter_ HAMMON, _his ~Serving-man~_, JANE _and~Others~_._Hodge._ Peace, my bullies; yonder they come._Ralph._ Stand to’t, my hearts. Firk, let me speak first._Hodge._ No, Ralph, let me.--Hammon, whither away so early?_Ham._ Unmannerly, rude slave, what’s that to thee?_Firk._ To him, sir? Yes, sir, and to me, and others.Good-morrow, Jane, how dost thou? Good Lord, how the world ischanged with you! God be thanked!_Ham._ Villains, hands off! How dare you touch my love?_All._ Villains? Down with them! Cry clubs for prentices![100][100] In any public affray, the cry was “Clubs, Clubs!”by way of calling for help (particularly by the London’prentices).--_Nares.__Hodge._ Hold, my hearts! Touch her, Hammon? Yea, and more thanthat: we’ll carry her away with us. My masters and gentlemen,never draw your bird-spits; shoemakers are steel to the back,men every inch of them, all spirit._Those of Hammon’s side._ Well, and what of all this?_Hodge._ I’ll show you.--Jane, dost thou know this man? ’TisRalph, I can tell thee; nay, ’tis he in faith, though he belamed by the wars. Yet look not strange, but run to him, foldhim about the neck and kiss him._Jane._ Lives then my husband? Oh God, let me go,Let me embrace my Ralph._Ham._                   What means my Jane?_Jane._ Nay, what meant you, to tell me, he was slain?_Ham._ Pardon me, dear love, for being misled.(_To_ RALPH.) ’Twas rumoured here in London, thou wert dead._Firk._ Thou seest he lives. Lass, go, pack home with him. Now,Master Hammon, where’s your mistress, your wife?_Serv._ ’Swounds, master, fight for her! Will you thus lose her?_All._ Down with that creature! Clubs! Down with him!_Hodge._ Hold, hold!_Ham._ Hold, fool! Sirs, he shall do no wrong.Will my Jane leave me thus, and break her faith?_Firk._ Yea, sir! She must, sir! She shall, sir! What then? Mendit!_Hodge._ Hark, fellow Ralph, follow my counsel: set the wench inthe midst, and let her choose her man, and let her be his woman._Jane._ Whom should I choose? Whom should my thoughts affectBut him whom Heaven hath made to be my love?Thou art my husband, and these humble weedsMakes thee more beautiful than all his wealth.Therefore, I will but put off his attire,Returning it into the owner’s hand,And after ever be thy constant wife._Hodge._ Not a rag, Jane! The law’s on our side; he thatsows in another man’s ground, forfeits his harvest. Get theehome, Ralph; follow him, Jane; he shall not have so much as abusk-point[101] from thee.[101] A piece of lace with a tag, which fastened the busk, orpiece of whalebone, used to keep the stays in position._Firk._ Stand to that, Ralph; the appurtenances are thine own.Hammon, look not at her!_Serv._ O, swounds, no!_Firk._ Blue coat, be quiet, we’ll give you a new livery else;we’ll make Shrove Tuesday Saint George’s Day for you. Look not,Hammon, leer not! I’ll firk you! For thy head now, one glance,one sheep’s eye, anything, at her! Touch not a rag, lest I andmy brethren beat you to clouts._Serv._ Come, Master Hammon, there’s no striving here._Ham._ Good fellows, hear me speak; and, honest Ralph,Whom I have injured most by loving Jane,Mark what I offer thee: here in fair goldIs twenty pound, I’ll give it for thy Jane;If this content thee not, thou shall have more._Hodge._ Sell not thy wife, Ralph; make her not a whore._Ham._ Say, wilt thou freely cease thy claim in her,And let her be my wife?_All._                  No, do not, Ralph._Ralph._ Sirrah Hammon, Hammon, dost thou think a shoemaker isso base to be a bawd to his own wife for commodity? Take thygold, choke with it! Were I not lame, I would make thee eat thywords._Firk._ A shoemaker sell his flesh and blood? Oh indignity!_Hodge._ Sirrah, take up your pelf, and be packing._Ham._ I will not touch one penny, but in lieuOf that great wrong I offered thy Jane,To Jane and thee I give that twenty pound.Since I have failed of her, during my life,I vow, no woman else shall be my wife.Farewell, good fellows of the gentle trade:Your morning mirth my mourning day hath made.      [_Exit.__Firk._ (_To the ~Serving-man~._) Touch the gold, creature, ifyou dare! Y’are best be trudging. Here, Jane, take thou it. Nowlet’s home, my hearts._Hodge._ Stay! Who comes here? Jane, on again with thy mask!_Enter the_ EARL OF LINCOLN, _the_ LORD MAYOR_and ~Servants~_._Lincoln._ Yonder’s the lying varlet mocked us so._L. Mayor._ Come hither, sirrah!_Firk._ I, sir? I am sirrah? You mean me, do you not?_Lincoln._ Where is my nephew married?_Firk._ Is he married? God give him joy, I am glad of it. Theyhave a fair day, and the sign is in a good planet, Mars in Venus._L. Mayor._ Villain, thou toldst me that my daughter RoseThis morning should be married at Saint Faith’s;We have watched there these three hours at the least,Yet see we no such thing._Firk._ Truly, I am sorry for’t; a bride’s a pretty thing._Hodge._ Come to the purpose. Yonder’s the bride and bridegroomyou look for, I hope. Though you be lords, you are not to bar byyour authority men from women, are you?_L. Mayor._ See, see, my daughter’s masked._Lincoln._                                  True, and my nephew,To hide his guilt, counterfeits him lame._Firk._ Yea, truly; God help the poor couple, they are lame andblind._L. Mayor._ I’ll ease her blindness._Lincoln._                           I’ll his lameness cure._Firk._ Lie down, sirs, and laugh! My fellow Ralph is taken forRowland Lacy, and Jane for Mistress Damask Rose. This is all myknavery._L. Mayor._ What, have I found you, minion?_Lincoln._                                  O base wretchNay, hide thy face, the horror of thy guiltCan hardly be washed off. Where are thy powers?What battles have you made? O yes, I see,Thou fought’st with Shame, and Shame hath conquered thee.This lameness will not serve._L. Mayor._                   Unmask yourself._Lincoln._ Lead home your daughter._L. Mayor._                         Take your nephew hence._Ralph._ Hence! Swounds, what mean you? Are you mad? I hope youcannot enforce my wife from me. Where’s Hammon?_L. Mayor._ Your wife?_Lincoln._ What, Hammon?_Ralph._ Yea, my wife; and, therefore, the proudest of you thatlays hands on her first, I’ll lay my crutch ’cross his pate._Firk._ To him, lame Ralph! Here’s brave sport!_Ralph._ Rose call you her? Why, her name is Jane. Look hereelse; do you know her now? [_Unmasking_ JANE._Lincoln._ Is this your daughter?_L. Mayor._                       No, nor this your nephew.My Lord of Lincoln, we are both abusedBy this base, crafty varlet._Firk._ Yea, forsooth, no varlet; forsooth, no base; forsooth, Iam but mean; no crafty neither, but of the gentle craft._L. Mayor._ Where is my daughter Rose? Where is my child?_Lincoln._ Where is my nephew Lacy married?_Firk._ Why, here is good laced mutton, as I promised you._Lincoln._ Villain, I’ll have thee punished for this wrong._Firk._ Punish the journeyman villain, but not the journeymanshoemaker._Enter_ DODGER._Dodger._ My lord, I come to bring unwelcome news.Your nephew Lacy and your daughter RoseEarly this morning wedded at the Savoy,None being present but the lady mayoress.Besides, I learnt among the officers,The lord mayor vows to stand in their defence’Gainst any that shall seek to cross the match._Lincoln._ Dares Eyre the shoemaker uphold the deed?_Firk._ Yes, sir, shoemakers dare stand in a woman’s quarrel, Iwarrant you, as deep as another, and deeper too._Dodger._ Besides, his grace to-day dines with the mayor;Who on his knees humbly intends to fallAnd beg a pardon for your nephew’s fault._Lincoln._ But I’ll prevent him! Come, Sir Roger Oateley;The king will do us justice in this cause.Howe’er their hands have made them man and wife,I will disjoin the match, or lose my life.      [_Exeunt.__Firk._ Adieu, Monsieur Dodger! Farewell, fools! Ha, ha! Oh, ifthey had stayed, I would have so lambed[102] them with flouts! Oheart, my codpiece-point is ready to fly in pieces every time Ithink upon Mistress Rose; but let that pass, as my lady mayoresssays.[102] Whipped._Hodge._ This matter is answered. Come, Ralph; home with thywife. Come, my fine shoemakers, let’s to our master’s, the newlord mayor, and there swagger this Shrove-Tuesday. I’ll promiseyou wine enough, for Madge keeps the cellar._All._ O rare! Madge is a good wench._Firk._ And I’ll promise you meat enough, for simp’ring Susankeeps the larder. I’ll lead you to victuals, my brave soldiers;follow your captain. O brave! Hark, hark! [_Bell rings.__All._ The pancake-bell rings, the pancake-bell! Tri-lill, myhearts!_Firk._ Oh brave! Oh sweet bell! O delicate pancakes! Open thedoors, my hearts, and shut up the windows! keep in the house,let out the pancakes! Oh rare, my hearts! Let’s march togetherfor the honour of Saint Hugh to the great new hall[103] inGracious Street-corner, which our master, the new lord mayor,hath built.[103] Leadenhall. [See note _post_, p. 85.]_Ralph._ O the crew of good fellows that will dine at my lordmayor’s cost to-day!_Hodge._ By the Lord, my lord mayor is a most brave man. Howshall prentices be bound to pray for him and the honour of thegentlemen shoemakers! Let’s feed and be fat with my lord’sbounty._Firk._ O musical bell, still! O Hodge, O my brethren! There’scheer for the heavens: venison-pasties walk up and down pipinghot, like sergeants; beef and brewess[104] comes marching indry-vats,[105] fritters and pancakes comes trowling in inwheel-barrows; hens and oranges hopping in porters’-baskets,collops and eggs in scuttles, and tarts and custards comesquavering in in malt-shovels.[104] See note _ante_, p. 19.[105] Barrels._Enter more ~Prentices~.__All._ Whoop, look here, look here!_Hodge._ How now, mad lads, whither away so fast?_1st Prentice._ Whither? Why, to the great new hall, know younot why? The lord mayor hath bidden all the prentices in Londonto breakfast this morning._All._ Oh brave shoemaker, oh brave lord of incomprehensiblegood-fellowship! Whoo! Hark you! The pancake-bell rings. [_Castup caps.__Firk._ Nay, more, my hearts! Every Shrove-Tuesday is our yearof jubilee; and when the pancake-bell rings, we are as free asmy lord mayor; we may shut up our shops, and make holiday. I’llhave it called Saint Hugh’s Holiday._All._ Agreed, agreed! Saint Hugh’s Holiday._Hodge._ And this shall continue for ever._All._ Oh brave! Come, come, my hearts! Away, away!_Firk._ O eternal credit to us of the gentle craft! March fair,my hearts! Oh rare! [_Exeunt._SCENE III.--_A Street in London.__Enter the_ KING _and his ~Train~ across the stage_._King._ Is our lord mayor of London such a gallant?_Nobleman._ One of the merriest madcaps in your land.Your grace will think, when you behold the man,He’s rather a wild ruffian than a mayor.Yet thus much I’ll ensure your majesty.In all his actions that concern his state,He is as serious, provident, and wise,As full of gravity amongst the grave,As any mayor hath been these many years._King._ I am with child,[106] till I behold this huff-cap.[107]But all my doubt is, when we come in presence,His madness will be dashed clean out of countenance.[106] In suspense.[107] _i.e._ Swaggerer._Nobleman._ It may be so, my liege._King._                             Which to prevent,Let some one give him notice, ’tis our pleasureThat he put on his wonted merriment.Set forward!_All._ On afore!      [_Exeunt._SCENE IV.--_A Great Hall.__Enter_ EYRE, HODGE, FIRK, RALPH, _and other ~Shoemakers~, all withnapkins on their shoulders_._Eyre._ Come, my fine Hodge, my jolly gentlemen shoemakers;soft, where be these cannibals, these varlets, my officers? Letthem all walk and wait upon my brethren; for my meaning is, thatnone but shoemakers, none but the livery of my company shall intheir satin hoods wait upon the trencher of my sovereign._Firk._ O my lord, it will be rare!_Eyre._ No more, Firk; come, lively! Let your fellow-prenticeswant no cheer; let wine be plentiful as beer, and beer as water.Hang these penny-pinching fathers, that cram wealth in innocentlamb-skins. Rip, knaves, avaunt! Look to my guests!_Hodge._ My lord, we are at our wits’ end for room; thosehundred tables will not feast the fourth part of them._Eyre._ Then cover me those hundred tables again, and again,till all my jolly prentices be feasted. Avoid, Hodge! Run,Ralph! Frisk about, my nimble Firk! Carouse me fathom-healths tothe honour of the shoemakers. Do they drink lively, Hodge? Dothey tickle it, Firk?_Firk._ Tickle it? Some of them have taken their liquor standingso long that they can stand no longer; but for meat, they wouldeat it, an they had it._Eyre._ Want they meat? Where’s this swag-belly, this greasykitchenstuff cook? Call the varlet to me! Want meat? Firk,Hodge, lame Ralph, run, my tall men, beleaguer the shambles,beggar all Eastcheap, serve me whole oxen in chargers, and letsheep whine upon the tables like pigs for want of good fellowsto eat them. Want meat? Vanish, Firk! Avaunt, Hodge!_Hodge._ Your lordship mistakes my man Firk; he means, theirbellies want meat, not the boards; for they have drunk so much,they can eat nothing.THE SECOND THREE MEN’S SONG.[108][108] See note to First Three Men’s Song, p. 46.Cold’s the wind, and wet’s the rain,  Saint Hugh be our good speed:Ill is the weather that bringeth no gain,  Nor helps good hearts in need.Trowl[109] the bowl, the jolly nut-brown bowl,  And here, kind mate, to thee:Let’s sing a dirge for Saint Hugh’s soul,  And down it merrily.[109] Pass, push about from one to the other, in drinking.Down a down heydown a down,  Hey derry derry, down a down!

Vanish, my tall shoemakers, mynimble brethren; look to my guests, the prentices. Yet stay alittle! How now, Hans? How looks my little Rose?_Hans._ Let me request you to remember me.I know, your honour easily may obtainFree pardon of the king for me and Rose,And reconcile me to my uncle’s grace._Eyre._ Have done, my good Hans, my honest journeyman; lookcheerily! I’ll fall upon both my knees, till they be as hard ashorn, but I’ll get thy pardon._Marg._ Good my lord, have a care what you speak to his grace._Eyre._ Away, you Islington whitepot![110] hence, youhopperarse! you barley-pudding, full of maggots! you broiledcarbonado![111] avaunt, avaunt, avoid, Mephistophiles! ShallSim Eyre learn to speak of you, Lady Madgy? Vanish, MotherMiniver-cap; vanish, go, trip and go; meddle with yourpartlets[112] and your pishery-pashery, your flewes[113] andyour whirligigs; go, rub, out of mine alley! Sim Eyre knows howto speak to a Pope, to Sultan Soliman, to Tamburlaine,[114]an he were here; and shall I melt, shall I droop before mysovereign? No, come, my Lady Madgy! Follow me, Hans! About yourbusiness, my frolic free-booters! Firk, frisk about, and about,and about, for the honour of mad Simon Eyre, lord mayor ofLondon.[110] “A dish, made of milk, eggs and sugar, baked in apot.”--_Webster._[111] A steak cut crossways for broiling.[112] Bands or collars for the neck.[113] Flaps; as resembling the hanging chaps of a hound.[114] The allusion is, no doubt, to Kyd’s _Soliman and Perseda_,and to Marlowe’s _Tamburlaine_, though these were long afterEyre’s time._Firk._ Hey, for the honour of the shoemakers. [_Exeunt._SCENE V.--_An Open Yard before the Hall.__A long flourish, or two. Enter the_ KING, Nobles, EYRE, MARGERY, LACY,ROSE. LACY _and_ ROSE _kneel_._King._ Well, Lacy, though the fact was very foulOf your revolting from our kingly loveAnd your own duty, yet we pardon you.Rise both, and, Mistress Lacy, thank my lord mayorFor your young bridegroom here._Eyre._ So, my dear liege, Sim Eyre and my brethren, thegentlemen shoemakers, shall set your sweet majesty’s image cheekby jowl by Saint Hugh for this honour you have done poor SimonEyre. I beseech your grace, pardon my rude behaviour; I am ahandicraftsman, yet my heart is without craft; I would be sorryat my soul, that my boldness should offend my king._King._ Nay, I pray thee, good lord mayor, be even as merryAs if thou wert among thy shoemakers;It does me good to see thee in this humour._Eyre._ Say’st thou me so, my sweet Dioclesian? Then, humph!Prince am I none, yet am I princely born. By the Lord ofLudgate, my liege, I’ll be as merry as a pie.[115][115] Magpie._King._ Tell me, in faith, mad Eyre, how old thou art._Eyre._ My liege, a very boy, a stripling, a younker; you seenot a white hair on my head, not a gray in this beard. Everyhair, I assure thy majesty, that sticks in this beard, Sim Eyrevalues at the King of Babylon’s ransom, Tamar Cham’s[116] beardwas a rubbing brush to’t: yet I’ll shave it off, and stufftennis-balls with it, to please my bully king.[116] Tamerlane (Tamburlaine), Cham, or Khan of Tartary. CompareShakespeare’s _Much Ado about Nothing_, Act II. Sc. i._King._ But all this while I do not know your age._Eyre._ My liege, I am six and fifty year old, yet I can cryhumph! with a sound heart for the honour of Saint Hugh. Markthis old wench, my king: I danced the shaking of the sheets withher six and thirty years ago, and yet I hope to get two or threeyoung lord mayors, ere I die. I am lusty still, Sim Eyre still.Care and cold lodging brings white hairs. My sweet Majesty, letcare vanish, cast it upon thy nobles, it will make thee lookalways young like Apollo, and cry humph! Prince am I none, yetam I princely born._King._ Ha, ha!Say, Cornwall, didst thou ever see his like?_Cornwall._ Not I, my lord._Enter the_ EARL OF LINCOLN _and the_ LORDMAYOR._King._                     Lincoln, what news with you?_Lincoln._ My gracious lord, have care unto yourself,For there are traitors here._All._ Traitors? Where? Who?_Eyre._ Traitors in my house? God forbid! Where be my officers?I’ll spend my soul, ere my king feel harm._King._ Where is the traitor, Lincoln?_Lincoln._                             Here he stands._King._ Cornwall, lay hold on Lacy!--Lincoln, speak,What canst thou lay unto thy nephew’s charge?_Lincoln._ This, my dear liege: your Grace, to do me honour,Heaped on the head of this degenerate boy Desertless favours;you made choice of him, To be commander over powers in France.But he----_King._ Good Lincoln, prithee, pause a while! Even in thine eyesI read what thou wouldst speak. I know how Lacy did neglectour love, Ran himself deeply, in the highest degree, Into viletreason----_Lincoln._ Is he not a traitor?_King._ Lincoln, he was; now have we pardoned him. ’Twas not abase want of true valour’s fire, That held him out of France,but love’s desire._Lincoln._ I will not bear his shame upon my back._King._ Nor shalt thou, Lincoln; I forgive you both._Lincoln._ Then, good my liege, forbid the boy to wed One whosemean birth will much disgrace his bed._King._ Are they not married?_Lincoln._ No, my liege._Both._ We are._King._ Shall I divorce them then? O be it far, That any hand onearth should dare untie The sacred knot, knit by God’s majesty;I would not for my crown disjoin their hands, That are conjoïnedin holy nuptial bands. How say’st thou, Lacy, wouldst thou losethy Rose?_Lacy._ Not for all India’s wealth, my sovereign._King._ But Rose, I am sure, her Lacy would forego?_Rose._ If Rose were asked that question, she’d say no._King._ You hear them, Lincoln?_Lincoln._ Yea, my liege, I do._King._ Yet canst thou find i’th’ heart to part these two? Whoseeks, besides you, to divorce these lovers?_L. Mayor._ I do, my gracious lord, I am her father._King._ Sir Roger Oateley, our last mayor, I think?_Nobleman._ The same, my liege._King._                         Would you offend Love’s laws?Well, you shall have your wills, you sue to me,To prohibit the match. Soft, let me see--You both are married, Lacy, art thou not?_Lacy._ I am, dread sovereign._King._                        Then, upon thy life,I charge thee, not to call this woman wife._L. Mayor._ I thank your grace._Rose._                         O my most gracious lord!      [_Kneels.__King._ Nay, Rose, never woo me; I tell you true,Although as yet I am a bachelor,Yet I believe, I shall not marry you._Rose._ Can you divide the body from the soul,Yet make the body live?_King._                 Yea, so profound?I cannot, Rose, but you I must divide.This fair maid, bridegroom, cannot be your bride.Are you pleased, Lincoln? Oateley, are you pleased?_Both._ Yes, my lord._King._               Then must my heart be eased;For, credit me, my conscience lives in pain,Till these whom I divorced, be joined again.Lacy, give me thy hand; Rose, lend me thine!Be what you would be! Kiss now! So, that’s fine.At night, lovers, to bed!--Now, let me see,Which of you all mislikes this harmony._L. Mayor._ Will you then take from me my child perforce?_King._ Why, tell me, Oateley: shines not Lacy’s nameAs bright in the world’s eye as the gay beamsOf any citizen?_Lincoln._      Yea, but, my gracious lord,I do mislike the match far more than he;Her blood is too too base._King._                    Lincoln, no more.Dost thou not know that love respects no blood,Cares not for difference of birth or state?The maid is young, well born, fair, virtuous,A worthy bride for any gentleman.Besides, your nephew for her sake did stoopTo bare necessity, and, as I hear,Forgetting honours and all courtly pleasures,To gain her love, became a shoemaker.As for the honour which he lost in France,Thus I redeem it: Lacy, kneel thee down!--Arise, Sir Rowland Lacy! Tell me now,Tell me in earnest, Oateley, canst thou chide,Seeing thy Rose a lady and a bride?_L. Mayor._ I am content with what your grace hath done._Lincoln._ And I, my liege, since there’s no remedy._King._ Come on, then, all shake hands: I’ll have you friends;Where there is much love, all discord ends.What says my mad lord mayor to all this love?_Eyre._ O my liege, this honour you have done to my finejourneyman here, Rowland Lacy, and all these favours which youhave shown to me this day in my poor house, will make Simon Eyrelive longer by one dozen of warm summers more than he should._King._ Nay, my mad lord mayor, that shall be thy name,If any grace of mine can length thy life,One honour more I’ll do thee: that new building,[117]Which at thy cost in Cornhill is erected,Shall take a name from us; we’ll have it calledThe Leadenhall, because in digging itYou found the lead that covereth the same.[117] “A.D. 1419. This year Sir Symon Eyre builtLeadenhall, at his proper expense, as it now appears, and gavethe same to the City to be employed as a public granary forlaying up corn against a time of scarcity.”--_Maitland_, ii., p.187._Eyre._ I thank your majesty._Marg._ God bless your grace!_King._ Lincoln, a word with you!_Enter_ HODGE, FIRK, RALPH, _and more~Shoemakers~_._Eyre._ How now, my mad knaves? Peace, speak softly, yonder isthe king._King._ With the old troop which there we keep in pay,We will incorporate a new supply.Before one summer more pass o’er my head,France shall repent, England was injured.What are all those?_Lacy._             All shoemakers, my liege,Sometime my fellows; in their companiesI lived as merry as an emperor._King._ My mad lord mayor, are all these shoemakers?_Eyre._ All shoemakers, my liege; all gentlemen of the gentlecraft, true Trojans, courageous cordwainers; they all kneel tothe shrine of holy Saint Hugh._All the Shoemakers._ God save your majesty!_King._ Mad Simon, would they anything with us?_Eyre._ Mum, mad knaves! Not a word! I’ll do’t; I warrant you.They are all beggars, my liege; all for themselves, and I forthem all on both my knees do entreat, that for the honour ofpoor Simon Eyre and the good of his brethren, these mad knaves,your grace would vouchsafe some privilege to my new Leadenhall,that it may be lawful for us to buy and sell leather there twodays a week._King._ Mad Sim, I grant your suit, you shall have patentTo hold two market-days in Leadenhall,Mondays and Fridays, those shall be the times.Will this content you?_All._ Jesus bless your grace!_Eyre._ In the name of these my poor brethren shoemakers, I mosthumbly thank your grace. But before I rise, seeing you are inthe giving vein and we in the begging, grant Sim Eyre one boonmore._King._ What is it, my lord mayor?_Eyre._ Vouchsafe to taste of a poor banquet that stands sweetlywaiting for your sweet presence._King._ I shall undo thee, Eyre, only with feasts;Already have I been too troublesome;Say, have I not?_Eyre._ O my dear king, Sim Eyre was taken unawares upon a dayof shroving,[118] which I promised long ago to the prentices ofLondon.[118] Merry-making.For, an’t please your highness, in time past,I bare the water-tankard, and my coatSits not a whit the worse upon my back;And then, upon a morning, some mad boys,It was Shrove Tuesday, even as ’tis now,Gave me my breakfast, and I swore then by the stopple of mytankard, if ever I came to be lord mayor of London, I wouldfeast all the prentices. This day, my liege, I did it, and theslaves had an hundred tables five times covered; they are gonehome and vanished;Yet add more honour to the gentle trade,Taste of Eyre’s banquet, Simon’s happy made._King._ Eyre, I will taste of thy banquet, and will say,I have not met more pleasure on a day.Friends of the gentle craft, thanks to you all,Thanks, my kind lady mayoress, for our cheer.--Come, lords, a while let’s revel it at home!When all our sports and banquetings are done,Wars must right wrongs which Frenchmen have begun.

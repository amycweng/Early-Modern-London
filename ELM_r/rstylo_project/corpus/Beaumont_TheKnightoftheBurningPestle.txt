Author: Francis BeaumontTitle: The Knight of the Burning Pestle._To the Readers of this COMEDY._    _Gentlemen_, the World is so nice in these our times, that    for Apparel, there is no fashion, For Musick, which is a rare    Art, (though now slighted) No Instrument; For Diet, none but    the _French_ Kickshoes that are delicate; and for Plaies, no    invention but that which now runneth an invective way, touching    some particular persons, or else it is contemned before it is    throughly understood. This is all that I have to say, That the    Author had no intent to wrong any one in this _Comedy_, but as    a merry passage, here and there interlaced it with delight,    which he hopes will please all, and be hurtful to none.The PROLOGUE.    _Where the Bee can suck no Honey, she leaves her sting behind;_    _and where the Bear cannot find_ Origanum _to heal his grief,    he blasteth all other leaves with his breath. We fear it is    like to fare so with us; that seeing you cannot draw from our_    _labours sweet content, you leave behind you a sower mis-like,    and with open reproach blame our good meaning, because you    cannot reap the wonted mirth. Our intent was at this time    to move inward delight, not outward lightness; and to breed    (if it might be) soft smiling, not loud laughing: knowing    it (to the wise) to be a great pleasure, to hear Counsel    mixed with Wit, as to the foolish to have sport mingled with    rudeness. They were banished the Theater of_ Athens, _and from_    Rome _hissed, that brought Parasites on t[h]e Stage with    apish actions, or Fools with uncivil habits, or Courtezans_    _with immodest words. We have endeavoured to be as far from    unseemly speeches, to make your ears glow, as we hope you    will be free from unkind reports, or mistaking the Authors    intention (who never aimed at any one particular in this    Play,) to make our cheeks blush. And thus I leave it, and    thee to thine own censure, to like, or dislike._ Vale.       *       *       *       *       *_The Actors Names._  The Prologue.  Then a Citizen.  The Citizens wife, and _Ralph_ her man, sitting below amidst      the Spectators.  A rich Merchant.  _Jasper_ his Apprentice.  Master _Humphrey_, a friend to the Merchant.  _Luce_, the Merchants Daughter.  Mistress _Merry-thought_, _Jaspers_ Mother.  _Michael_, a second Son of Mistriss _Merry-thought_.  Old M. _Merry-thought_.  A Squire.  A Dwarfe.  A Tapster.  A Boy that Danceth and Singeth.  An Host.  A Barber.  Two Knights.  A Captain.  A Sergeant.  Soldiers.                           _Enter_ Prologue.    From all that's near the Court, from all that's great    Within the compass of the City-walls    We now have brought our Scene.                            _Enter_ Citizen.    _Cit._ Hold your peace good-man boy.    _Pro._ What do you mean Sir?    _Cit._ That you have no good meaning: These seven years there    hath been Plays at this House, I have observed it, you have    still girds at Citizens; and now you call your Play _The_    _London Merchant_.

Mer._ If you would consider your estate, you would have    little list to sing, I-wisse.    _Old Mer._ It should never be consider'd, while it were an    estate, if I thought it would spoil my singing.    _Mist. Mer._ But how wilt thou do _Charles_, thou art an old    man, and thou canst not work, and thou hast not forty shillings    left, and thou eatest good meat, and drinkest good drink, and    laughest?    _Old Mer._ And will doe.    _Mist. Mer._ But how wilt thou come by it _Charles_?    _Old Mer._ How? why how have I done hitherto these forty years?    I never came into my Dining-room, but at eleven and six a    clock, I found excellent meat and drink a'th' Table: my Cloaths    were never worn out, but next morning a Tailor brought me a    new suit; and without question it will be so ever! Use makes    perfectness. If all should fail, it is but a little straining    my self extraordinary, and laugh my self to death.    _Wife._ It's a foolish old man this: is not he _George_?    _Cit._ Yes Cunny.    _Wife._ Give me a penny i'th' purse while I live _George_.    _Cit._ I by Lady Cunnie, hold thee there.    _Mist.

Farewel _Jasper_; but    yet, or e'r you part (oh cruel) kiss me, kiss me sweeting, mine    own dear jewel: So, now begone; no words.                                                         [_Exit_ Jasper.    _Mist. Mer._ So _Michael_, now get thee gone too.    _Mich._ Yes forsooth Mother, but I'll have my Father's blessing    first.    _Mist. Mer._ No _Michael_, 'tis no matter for his blessing;    thou hast my blessing, begone; I'll fetch my money and jewels,    and follow thee: I'll stay no longer with him I warrant thee;    truly _Charles_ I'll begon too.    [_Old Mer._ What you will not?]    _Mist. Mer._ Yes indeed will I.    _Old Mer._ Hay ho, farewel _Nan_, I'll never trust wench more    again, if I can.    _Mist. Mer._ You shall not think (when all your own is gone) to    spend that I have been scraping up for _Michael_.    _Old Mer._ Farewel good wife, I expect it not; all I have to do    in this world, is to be merry: which I shall, if the ground be    not taken from me: and if it be,    When Earth and Seas from me are reft,    The Skies aloft for me are left.

lay not vp treasures for your selues vpon the earth where the moath and canker corrupt and where theeues digge through and steale but lay vp treasures for your selues in heauen where neither the moath nor canker corrupteth and where theeues neither break through nor steale here beginneth the fift part of christs sermon containing a seuerall distinct doctrine from the rest from this verse to the is contained a discourse touching the reforme of couetousnesse that is the disordered and inordinate care of earthly things the ground of which discourse lyeth in this and verses in them christ layeth downe a double commaundement the things forbidden are the practises of couetousnesse of which that wee may speake in order first let vs see the sense and meaning of the words there bee two things contained in them lay not vp hoord heape the greeke woord signifieth more then the translation expresseth and namely two things first to gather together secondly to store vp things gathered together against the time to come that it hath these two significations see romaines verse treasures aboundance of worldly wealth and excellent things of great price as golde siluer plate iewelles rings precious stones ampc vpon the earth here he noteth not so much the place of treasure as the kind of treasure earthly for your selues for your owne priuate gaine and commoditie all respects of the good eyther of the church or common wealth set aside now that we may see what is forbidden we must first see what he forbad not first he forbids not here labour in our calling wherby we prouide things necessarie for vs and ours for that were against himselfe gen in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eate bread secondly he forbids not the possession of goods and riches for they are the blessings of god iob thirdly he doth not forbid the gathering or keeping of treasure for the word of god alloweth of some treasure as corinthian for the child and for the church and ioseph is commended for hoording vp corne in the seuen yeares of plentie against the seuen yeares of dearth gen yes in the temple there was a treasure by the appointment of god made maintained and continued from time to time therfore hee dooth not simply condemne the gathering of riches or the laying vp of them what forbids he then sundry practises of couetousnesse implyed in the verse the first practise is excesse in seeking worldly wealth whe man know amp keepe no meane moderation or measure and that we may see the daunger of this vice i will answere this question how farre a man may seeke and prouide for worldely wealth in answere wherof i lay this ground for a foundatio that is mens goods must be distinguished into three sorts viz necessaria abundatia superflua that is necessarie abundance and superfluous necessarie goods are twofolde some are necessary to the nature and some are necessarie to the person and condition of man those which are necessary to nature are such as without which neither a man himselfe nor his family can liue as meate drinke cloath and lodging those which are necessarie to the person that is to any mans state condition calling or kinde of life are such as the artificers instruments the trade mans tooles and the students bookes now here ariseth a question or two by the way what goods and how much is necessarie for the person for answere wherof the opinion and iudgement of the couetous must be no rule because his heart is a sea vnsatiable or that cannot be filled what then must bee the rule thereof there is no certaine rule therefore the iudgement of the wise learned godly and christian frugall man must be the rule to iudge what is necessarie and whatsoeuer is in their iudgement necessarie must be so accounted further things necessarie must not bee iudged onely by the present vse but also by the vse in time to come as for example a trade man groweth in yeares and hath nothing to liue on besides his trade his hands and sight faile him therefore hee prouides something to maintaine him in his olde age and layeth it vp for a certaine and necessarie vse in time to come vntill his death again a man that hath children the time will come when he must giue them their portions and therefore he may prouide for the against they come to age and hee sinneth not but doth well because it serueth for a certaine vse in time to come thus farre of the first sort that is of necessarie goods now of the next the second kinde is aboundance that is plentie of worldly riches wherewith a man is so stored that hee hath both for a necessitie and also for an holy delight and hearts ease the third are superfluous these are such whereof a man hath neither present vse nor any certain vse in time to come now i answere to the first question viz how farre a man may seek amp prouide for worldly wealth i say that things necessary for nature for a mans person amp place may be sought for and laide vp but here is a barre put in by god himselfe we may goe no further we may not seeke for aboundance or superfluitie the reason hereof is alledged in the chapter of the prouerbes the and verses where it is said giue mee not pouertie nor riches feede mee with foode conuement for mee least i bee full and denye thee and saye who is the lorde ampc that which wee must aske of god that we may seeke for and no more but wee haue no warrant to aske at god handes aboundance or superfluitie therefore wee may not seeke for them againe if wee haue meate and drinke we must therewith be content tim if wee must pray for nothing or labour for nothing more then is necessarie then what shall we doo if god giue aboundance wee must not seeke aboundance but if god cast it vpon vs without seeking wee must thankefully receiue it lay it vp and vse it for the good of the church and commo wealth and for the good of our owne families if this bee so that wee must seeke for nothing but necessaries then wee must learne contentednesse therewith which that we may doo weigh these reasons following first it is god commaundement that we should be content with things necessary and seeke no further therefore wee must be obedient and content secondly a man that is too greedie to lay vp much can hardly keep a good conscience but must needs vse some vniust meanes thirdly such are subiect to the diuels snare tim fourthly in persecution and times of triall the richest will hardly confesse christ amp hold out but will be the more easily drawne from christ and the confession of the truth because their mindes are glewed to the things of this world heerevnto may bee added the examples of many saints who haue bene contented with little that they might serue god the better and also christes admonition how hard it is for a rich man to enter into the kingdome of heauen thus much of the first practise of couetousnesse which is excessiue seeking of goods without al measure the second practise is when worldly goods are sought onely and principally which practise christ meets withal when he saith first seeke the kingdome of god this was esaus sinne and the sinne of the gadarens math who preferred worldly goods before spirituall treasure and this may be called vnreasonable disorder preposterousnesse worldlinesse ampc the third practise is to put our trust and confidence in riches laid vp and to make them our god and rather to forsake god then them tim psalm the fourth practise is when a man layeth vp for himselfe onely and not for the church nor common wealth but sibi soli this man may bee called churle niggard ampc all these practises of couetousnes christ condemneth thus much concerning that which is forbidden now followeth the reason vvhere moth rust and thiefe ampc the reason standeth thus that which is subiect to vanitie to casualtie and corruption must not bee our treasure but earthly goods gold siluer riches cloathes ampc are subiect to such things therefore they must not bee our treasure the greeke word ss is a moath or worme that wasteth and consumeth the best garments amp may be taken here for any worme that doth destroy and consume any creature brsis a canker this translation is too strict for it signifieth any thing that wasteth any creature whatsoeuer heere then is set downe the vanitie of the creatures which vanitie stands in two points first in the corruption secondly in the abuse of the creature touching the corruption it teacheth vs that gold and siluer yes that al riches haue some diseases to waste them or some canker to rust and consume them touching the abuse of the creature it stands in this that it is subiect to the iniurie and ill vsage of man as riches are whe they are hoorded vp and serue for no vse from whence comes this vanitie from mans sinne rom which when wee consider it puts vs in minde of our sinnes howe loathsome they are that they are causes of vanitie to the creatures both by corruption and abuse christ seeing man bent and disposed to treasure vp wealth in abundance calles them back to an other kinde of treasure better then that as much as heauen is better then earth and an heauenly life better the a little money or mucke and therefore hee saith lay not vp treasure in earth that is let not all your heart and minde be set vpon this i can tell you a little better treasure here i might take occasio to inueigh against mens ill dispositions and affections who will not follow this good counsell but still preferre earth before heauen for all this admonition euery man by nature is greedie to gather goods and desirous to be rich but fewe care to be rich in god what profit did the rich man receiue by all their treasure luke and had it not bene a great deale better if they had possessed lesse so they had enioyed this but let vs come to the verse this is a straunge instruction and precept to lay vp treasure in heauen why how should we come there indeed christ saith it is hard for rich man to come there and yet they haue meanes to make it easie if they will how shall wee lay vp therefore thus lay out here and lock it not vp and so you shall lay vp treasure in heauen tim otherwise if you lay vp here and imprison the coyne that it cannot be currant you lay vp a treasure in hell rom for by your hardnesse of heart what doo you else but treasure vp wrath against the latter day so that this place seemeth to be a speciall motiue to charitie and liberalitie but yet it is not to be restrained to that as if it pertained onely to rich man then how shall the poore lay vp treasure in heauen who want it in earth very well for they must make god their treasure and christ and his word and so all their treasure is spirituall and heauenly and this dauid made more account of then any treasure whatsoeuer ps and say with him psalm thou article my portion lord rich man vse at euery yeares end to cast vp theyr accounts to see how their store and treasure encreaseth and it is not amisse but it were better if they would take a time for this account and see how this encreaseth the rich man in the gospell had gold inough siluer amp corn great store euen by his owne confession and yet he was but a foole amp that a miserable foole because he sought not this say that a man could get all the world into his hands though it be not possible i pray you what would it profit him if hee loose his soule for his labour what madnesse is it then to heape vp treasure in earth and not to regard the true treasure in heauen but lay vp treasures in heauen ampc in this last part of this chapter christ goeth about to reforme his hearers in regard of the practise of couetousnesse and begins at the verse teaching the first what to eschew not forbidding them to haue riches but forbidding to seeke and get them and to gather them without measure moderation and with excesse secondly when they seeke them onely and principally thirdly when they make them their felicitie fourthly when they gather riches for themselues without respect of the commo good eyther of the church or of the common wealth these foure abuses are here forbidden now because it is mans nature to seeke treasure and man cannot be broken from it but they wil haue a treasure christ addes this commaundement in which he teacheth his servant in all ages what to doo in this case but lay vp treasures in heauen ampc these words containe a commandement informing vs in our dutie and a reason of the same lay vp ampc as if he shuld haue said seeing your naturall disposition is such that you wil and must neeeds haue a treasure i will shewe you what you shall do if you will be ruled by mine aduise and followe my counsell you shall lay vp treasure in heauen because there neither moath nor canker can come to corrupt touching the commaundement it may bee demaunded why christ gaue it to his disciples seeing it is not in the power of any creature to do this no more then to saue himselfe but the beginning progresse and end of saluation is from god therefore why doth hee propound the commandement in this forme and tenure it is an vsuall thing in the scriptures to ascribe and attribute the worke and effect of the principall cause to the instrument whereby a thing is effected thus in the last verse of obadiah preachers are expresly called sauiours so tim paul saith in doing this thou shalt both saue thy selfe and them that heare thee yet saluatio is the proper worke of god alone but because preachers are god instruments for the saluation of his people therfore they are called sauiours so here to gather and lay vp treasure in heauen it is the worke of god alone it is not in the power of any ma nay as much as in vs lieth we treasure vp nothing but wrath rom and yet because we are instruments of it it pleaseth god to ascribe his owne worke to vs who are but instruments amp that by his grace now they to whom the comandement is giuen must bee conceiued as mebers of christ and instruments of god that we may the better conceiue of this commandement and practise it two points must be considered first what this treasure is secondly how euery one may lay it vp for himselfe of these in order with reuerence for they are points of great waight and moment the very maine point of our saluation standeth in the practise of these consider what is erroniously counted to be this treasure and then search the word to finde out the truth the papists haue long abused the world with shewing the false treasure for they make it a commo chest in which is gathered and stored all the ouerplus of christes merits and of the saints merits of all ages and this chest is in the popes custodie and hee onely hath the ordering amp disposing opening and shutting giuing out of indulgences amp pardons when where and to whom hee listeth and by this treasure he vpholdeth and maintaineth his kingdome hereby comes his riches and reuenewes but this treasure is not good and currant for it hath two defects first they make christ his merits to be vnsufficient for if his passion must haue an addition and supply from man it is a poore treasure secondly they make the merits of saints deceased to bee our merits and that is not possible for if man could merit yet it should but be for themselues alone all man are but priuate man in regard of saluation and so their merits if they were any should be proper and personall thus you see their treasure is defectiue in a double respect and therefore to let it passe we are to renounce it and leaue it to them now let vs with reuerence come to cosider what is indeed the true treasure here ment and mentioned it is the true god to speake in fewe words one god in three persons creator of all things in whom all the treasures of happinesse are to be found gen i am god all sufficient and gen thy exceeding great reward and psalm a large amp beautifull portion and this is as much as if hee had said the lord is my treasure i will not stand long vpon this for man by light of nature haue seene and said this and s paul saith god is all in all to the elect corinthian but marke how he must bee considered that he may be our treasure to this ende wee must conceiue of god as hee hath reuealed himselfe to vs in christ for god in christ made manifest is our treasure and not otherwise without christ this the gentiles neuer knew column in him is the treasure of all wisedome and knowledge there he is made the churches treasure and coloss our felicitie and life eternall is hidde with god in christ there hee is made the treasure fountaine and store house of our eternall happinesse john iohn baptist saith of his fulnesse wee receiue grace for grace hee makes christ that treasure whence wee receiue that grace which wee haue and corinthians christ is our treasure whence we receiue our righteousnesse wisedome sanctification aud redemption therefore it remaineth that god reuealing himselfe in christ or god incarnate or christ god and man is the treasure of the church now that hee may bee our treasure we must cosider him as hee is reuealed and set forth vnto vs in his word and sacraments for so is he a treasure and no otherwise therfore christ crucified dying and rising againe is our treasure our treasure lyeth all in his suffering death and bloud shed and for this cause we must so conceiue of him as crucified for our sinnes why is christ called our treasure hee is the fountaine of all true blessednesse that is conueyed from god to man and from him doth proceed all our felicitie amp happinesse whatsoeuer wouldest thou haue remissio of sinnes amp life eternall wouldest thou haue any temporall blessings or comfort by them or comfort in distresse thou must haue it from christ crucified the good things that come vnto vs if they come not as fro christ they are no blessings vnto vs if he then be the fountain of all true happinesse he is the true treasure besides or without him there is none in a word then remember this that the treasure here spoken of is god reuealing himself vnto vs in christ by whom he conueyeth all good things to vs and this is that which christ aymeth at in this place now hauing found what the true treasure is let vs see how euery one of vs may lay it vp for our selues as we are here commaunded and that wee may so doo some particular things are to be performed insinuated in math you may reade them there where the kingdome of god is compared to a treasure hidde in the fielde ampc concerning which fiue things are to be noted first finding it secondly the price or value of it thirdly getting it fourthly keeping it fiftly vsing it the first of these is necessarie for vntill it be found wee can neither value it get it keepe it nor vse it therefore this is first to bee done of vs wee must finde it before we can haue it and enioy it it is called a hidden treasure because the naturall man cannot discerne it and the finding of it is when god reueales it to man and makes them feele that themselues stand in neede of it this is the right finding of it when god makes a man in his conscience to feele the want of it then he begins to seeke that which hee neuer sawe before not euerie reuealing of the treasure is a finding of it for god inlightens man two wayes first generally whereby a man reading the word is able to vnderstand the meaning of it and to conceiue the generall sense but besides this there is a second kinde when god makes a man to discerne the worde in his owne soule and conscence that is a speciall and distinct kinde of illumination and it appertaineth vnto fewe to bee able to discerne the power of the word in our owne consciences but when this is once wrought in vs then doth a man find this treasure the outward senses cannot discerne it for it is hidden and then it is found onely when man feele the want of it this is a great blessing of god and not common to all nor to many for our eyes are dazeled with the pompes pleasures and vanities of the world nay they that are learned are blinded with humane wisedome not euery one that can preach hath foud out this treasure man may haue great gifts and yet want this and faile in finding it till they feele themselues to stand in neede of christs righteousnesse god hath hidden this from the wise and great ones often and reuealed it to the simple before we proceed any further let vs descend into our owne hearts and trie whether wee haue yet found this treasure for we may perswade our selues amisse as the iewes who haue a vaile before their eyes these many yeares if we finde that we acknowledge christ to be the principall treasure and that wee want him then wee finde him but if our eyes be not opened yet let vs labour for it for otherwise we can neuer get it or haue vse of it if we neuer finde it and the cause why there is so litle ioy in the word and so little comfort and sweetnesse in the doctrine of the gospell is because wee neuer yet found the treasure which it speaketh of amp hath hidde in it the second action to bee performed is when our hearts and eies are enlightned so that wee haue founde it then to estimate and prise it for then it begins to be a treasure to vs whe we prise it as the man doth matthew who valued it at more then all his goods nay if a man had a whole world of wealth all were nothing in comparison of this this is more worth then all the world or all things in the world philip paul valued it at such a price that he counted all things losse and dung and no better in regard of christ marke what a high price hee sets it at all his good workes were nothing to it this second thing is necessarie for all the that would lay vp treasure in heauen therefore let vs haue a care of this dutie and learne to value christ aboue all things whatsoeuer how excellent soeuer they be wee haue well profited in the schoole of christ and begin to make good proceedings when wee can prise this treasure at a due and true rate to proceede the scripture doth reueale this treasure therfore as this treasure must be valued aboue all so this word which reueales it must be preferred aboue all things as dauid did psalm it is better to him then much riches yes the finest gold of ophyr or india was not comparable vnto it and christ saith his fruits are better then fine gold therefore this must be valued aboue all writings for it sheweth more then any other can do it were to be wished therefore that it had his due estimation and value amongst vs many make but one truth and it is all one with them whether it bee out of mens writings or god word but they are farre deceiued for the word of god alone is the truth according to godlinesse which doth discouer the heauenly treasure and it is to bee honoured aboue all writings though it be brought in earthen vessels if wee had learned to value this treasure amp the word which reuealeth it wee should profit more for knowledge and obedience then we do we would reuerence it more and reioyce in it more then we doo ampc when we haue found it and valued it we must seeke to get it and make it our owne for so it is in that parable we must vse all meanes to purchase it to our selues for so the commandement is here lay vp treasures for your selues that wee may get it to our selues we must vse such means as god hath appointed for this end and they are these first we must heare the word with all care diligence and reuerence and mixe it with faith secondly wee must receiue the sacraments with due preparation and reuerence thirdly wee must pray earnestly and costantly with faith and amongst all other meanes this especially must be vsed by vs the reasons hereof are these the word and sacraments are god hand wherewith he giues this treasure vnto vs and our faith shewing it selfe in our prayers is a hand whereby we receiue it god in his word doth offer it with his hand and wee by faith earnestly asking it do receiue it by faith wee make christs right to be ours amp also his obedience amp merits therefore vse all these good meanes first of hearing the word secondly of receiuing the sacraments thirdly of prayer in faith and bee constant in these duties and thou shalt haue this treasure as thine owne for faith is the only meanes whereby we attaine it after that we haue some testimony in our cosciences that we haue gotten it wee must labour to assure our selues of it how must we doo this for this purpose read tim charge the rich that they bee not high minded ampc marke there how by liberalitie and bountie we are exhorted to lay a good foundation what must wee bee saued by our almes deedes no this foundatio is not laid in heauen for that is our electio which god laieth vp there but our foundation is our conscience amp that is by good works by which as by fruites me may assure themselues that eternall life appertaineth vnto them workes of mercie done with simplicitie amp singlenes of heart are markes of the children of god signes of true faith and of the true treasure for this cause paul would haue rich man to lay vp a foundation in their consciences lastly wee must vse it as a treasure when wee haue done the foure things before mentioned then come to this to this ende diverse duties are required at our hands to be performed of vs first we must haue our conuersation in heauen if christ be our treasure then our affection ioy comfort our heart minde and all the whole man liuing on earth must be in heauen if christ bee thy treasure and his bloud and passion then all thy hart hope ioy and comfort is there therfore we must send vp our hearts to heauen otherwise he is not our treasure if wee will vse him as our treasure let all our care and ioy bee in and for heauen secondly wee must turne earthly goods into heauenly treasure how why hee that giueth to the poore lendeth vnto the lord the lord becomes a debter to him and boroweth of him for the poore the poore is but the lordes bayliffe and messenger whom he sends to the rich and hee returnes a rewarde of heauenly treasure for it marke there how by giuing almes to the lordes poore we turn earthly blessings into heauenly luke expressing these words saith sell all that you haue and giue to the poore make your selues purses which shall last for euer when man do so the they turne their temporall goods into heauenly treasure and so man that haue this worlds goods may by the blessing of god make great encrease of them thirdly we must part with all for this the best thing in the world must not bee too deare though it bee our owne bloud and our life we must part with them rather then with th and when wee are thus minded then wee carrie our selues to christ esteeming him as our treasure when wee esteeme any thing aboue him or preferre ought before him he is not our treasure thus you see fiue duties all necessary to be performed that we may keepe this commaundement and when by god grace wee are enabled to doo these then we shall obey and practise this commaundement therefore lette vs remember them and bee carefull to performe them so long as wee liue and marke what will follow if wee can finde it and value it ampc we will bee content to endure whatsoeuer god hand shall lay vpon vs in body or soule and neuer bee dismayed nor discouraged with any thing that befalles vs nothing can daunt or discourage a mans heart that hath this treasure but they shall vanish all in time further it will make that we shall neuer feare death nor iudgement all paines will bee nothing great comfort ease and contentation shalbe to vs so long as wee liue if wee can doo thus now a word or two of the reason the reason is drawne from the certaintie and vnchangeablenesse of the treasure earthly riches are subiect to wormes and cankers and if no canker can come to corrupt them yet the thiefe will haue them but there is no canker moath nor thiefe that can hurt christ and his merits why the highest heauens the place of happinesse should bee free from that vanitie and corruption which the lower heauens and all other creatures be subiect vnto all that we see ouer our heads is subiect to vanitie euen the starres to man by right of creation belongeth the earth and the heauens and they were all mans by creation euen the highest heauens to the very firmament by creation all were mans they were made for him and he was lord of all they were his pallace all sauing god throne and when he fell he was punished in all these creatures but not in the highest heauen because the right vnto it is not by nature but aboue nature and is ours by right of redemption and not by right of creation secondly by christs death and passion they are made ours and not by nature but by grace onely and that after the fall therefore the heauens and the starres and all creatures visible are subiect to vanitie and corruption and so much of the commaundement and the reason i beg you remember it and learne it and put it in practise both in life and death in the two verses next before going these words christ gaue two commaundements first what we should not doo and the reason of it secondly what we should do amp a reason therof the first a corruptione amp mutabilitate the second ab incorruptione amp immutabilitate now he renders a common reason pertaining to both and serues to confirme both which is thus framed where your treasure is there your hearts will bee but your heart must not be on earthly treasure but on heauenly therefore lay not vp treasure in earth but in heauen now touching the words and the meaning of them by treasure vnderstad things excellent and precious in our estimation laid vp for time to come in which man place and put theyr principall ioy and comfort where your treasure is that is your speciall ioye and felicitie for so much the worde treasure imports by heart vnderstand the principall powers and actions of the soule as the thoughts and affections loue ioy feare ampc yes the labour paines studie care and endeuour all these are to bee vnderstood by this word heart as if hee should haue said thus your treasure and heart are things ioyned together and inseperable therefore where your treasure is there is also your care and studie for that which man iudge to bee their principall good and felicitie in seeking it they spend al their paines and time now for our further edification let vs see what vses may be made of this reason first wee learne here how to iudge aright of our owne hearts indeed it is a bottomelesse gulfe as ieremy saith yet we may in some sort search it and iudge of it by this sentence for an earthly treasure and a carnall heart goe together and on the contrary part a heauenly treasure and a spirituall heart goe together these cannot be seuered therefore looke vpon what you spend your thoughts and cares and accordingly iudge of your selues if vpon earthly things your minde bee set and fixed then your heart is earthly and carnall it is most certaine christ hath giuen the sentence if you pleade that it cannot bee because you heare the word receiue the sacraments and pray ampc all this is nothing if your minde and affection be in this world you deceiue your selues for where your heart is there your treasure is and contrary if our principall thoughts and affections be in heauen and our care be for that principally then our heart is he auenly and our treasure heauenly and thus we may iudge of our selues and search our hearts whether they be carnall or spirituall secondly hereby we may all trie our selues without deceit plainly whether wee haue any portion in heauen or no for if our hearts be on the earth only or chiefly all our portio is here and none in heauen the man whose portion is in heauen hath his heart and affections there though you professe christ though you heare the word pray receiue the sacraments yet you may be deceiued therefore looke to this for if thy heart be here thou hast yet no treasure laid vp in heauen thirdly by this coupling of the hart and treasure we learne that wee must not regard this world amp teporall life nay we must despise it so farre forth as it may be done without hatred of a good blessing amp vnthankfulnesse to god for this life is a blessing of god giuen vs to prepare our selues for a better therefore simply we are not to despise it but in respect of heauen and as we must not regard this life so our meditation must be of heauen and not of the earth for heauen cannot bee thy treasure except thy heart be there therefore drawe thy delight from worldly things and weane it to heauen so much for this verse the light of the body is the eye if then thine eye be single thy whole body shall bee light but if thine eye bee wicked then all thy body shalbe dark wherfore if the light that is in thee be darknes how great is that darkenesse this part hath diverse expositions first i will touch one of the principall though i take it not to be the rightest and the i will set downe that which i take to bee the best and thirdly i will shew how this depends on those things that go before which will then best appeare when the sense is made manifest by single eye some vnderstand a liberall minde and by a wicked eye an enuious and couetous minde and so they expound these words of envy and couetousnesse and this exposition is to the purpose and the words of good and euill eye will beare this sense for salomon puts the good eye for a liberal heart amp an evil eye for a couetous heart prouerbes therefore this is a good sense but not the proper meaning of this place as i take it because the single eye and the light of the body are put for one and the selfe same thing now the light that is in vs is the vnderstanding amp iudgement againe it is said here that the eye is the light of the body now a liberall eye cannot bee the light of the body for all actions but for liberall actions only therefore though it be true that the single eye is a liberall minde and the euill eye a couetous minde yet it is not proper to this place wherfore we must search further the words be similies and there bee diverse similies in the the comparison is borrowed from a candle which serues to lighten all that be in the house so the eye serues to light all the body and giue direction to all the actions if thine eye be single to the ende of the verse there is a double simily which goeth thus as a man that hath a good and cleare sight in his bodily eye can carrie his body any way right and keepe it without wandring and stumbling but if the bodily eye haue any default or defect if it be dimme and corrupt then a man cannot walke without falling or stumbling nay further if a man haue an eye and it bee blinde hee cannot finde one steppe of his way in the same maner saith christ if you haue a minde to iudge rightly all is well but if the iudgement bee corrupted there is much darknesse many wants and faults this is the plaine comparison here vsed to come to the words the light of the body is the eye these words are plaine if thine eye be single here vnderstand the mind resembled by the bodily eye the single eye is the minde able to iudge of things to be done or not to be done good or bad the whole body shall be light that is the whole life for looke as the eye is to the body so is the minde to the life bright that is the whole course of our life shall bee well ordered if god giue man a minde well disposed but if thine eye be wicked that is if the mind be corrupted the iudgement depraued the vnderstanding darkened so that a man cannot rightly discerne of things to bee done though there be some light remembrance all thy body shall bee darke that is thy life will be full of sinne and disorder for therein stands the darkenesse when the vnderstanding is dimmed and darkened there the life is out of order if the light that is in thee bee darknesse that is if the naturall light of reason vnderstanding and iudgement which is left after the fall and which god hath put into euery man how great is that darknesse that is then there is no difference betweene the life of a man and a beast when the light of naturall reason is put out so as there is no power of iudgement or discerning ampc this i take to bee the truest and fittest exposition now hauing found the meaning let vs come to consider how this depends on the words going before i take it they depend as an answere to an obiection for the two former commaundements are hard to flesh and bloud man cannot brooke them therfore christ before he leaues it cuts off all the cauils which might be made against it if treasure must bee laid vp in heauen why doo all the wisest man seeke earthly treasure so much the effect of the answere is this wee need not to maruell at it for they want the gift of discerning theyr eye is blinde and they cannot discerne things that differ earthly and heauenly and so it comes to passe that they omit the seeking of heauenly treasure here some things must bee supplied by the readers minde euery mas eye is eyther a blinde corrupt or single eye the single eye befalles not all but those only to whom it is giuen of god the corrupt eye appertaines to all and some by sin put out the light of nature and hence it is that man omit heauenly treasure this i take to bee the true and right meaning and thus the dependance is in good order giuing vs the maine cause of couetousnesse which is a blind eye so that they cannot see to put difference betweene heauenly and earthly treasure here three things are to be considered the single eye the wicked eye and the blinde eye with the fruites and effects of euery one the single eye is the light of the body there is exprest and noted the single eye with the fruites therof viz to giue light to all the body the wicked eye makes the body darke of these in order and first we will begin with the single eye and that you may know what is meant hereby i will describe it plainely by single eye vnderstand the minde of a man endued with true and heauenly wisedome for it is the single eye the minde that hath this gift which is enlightned with true wisedome then if we shall knowe what true wisedome is we shall knowe what this eye is therefore touching wisedome it is a gift of god in christ no common gift which euery professor may haue but a speciall gift from god to them that are in christ corinthians christ is made of god to vs wisedome not onely because hee is the maker and author of wisedome but also because hee is the roote from whence all our wisedome springs we must bee set to him and engraffed in him we must be made bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh as his righteousnesse is made ours by imputation and our holinesse is from his holinesse as from the roote so our wisedome is from his wisedome as the braunch from the stocke and the fruite from the tree this wisedome befalles not the diuell and his angels not all man nor all christians in name but onely those that are in christ truly for from his wisedome proceedes the true wisedome so then wee must coceiue of it that this wisdome is a gift of god to them that are in christ this spiritual wisedome hath two actions first to discerne things that differ secondly to discerne one thing from an other spiritually s paul prayeth that the philippians may be enriched with knowledge and sense or iudgement what is this sense that we might be able to discern things differing and be sincere marke how hee ioyned with knowledge sense that is a gift of discerning good and badde earthly and heauenly what we must do and what we must leaue vndone we ought to haue our senses exercised to discerne good and euill that is wee ought to be endued with the propertie of true wisdome to haue our senses enured to put difference betweene things good and euill and this is the first point of heauenly wisdome to put such a difference as for example hee that is in christ and hath this spirit of discerning hee can discerne the voyce of his shepheard and can put a difference betweene it and all the voyces of false shepheards againe by this man can distinguish betweene the water in baptisme and other water betweene the bread and the wine on the lord table and common bread and wine and the discerning of these is by this gift of wisedome thirdly by this the church of god is able to discerne of afflictios betweene crosses and curses chastisements amp iudgements he can take the hand of god for a fatherly correction and for no curse nor iudgemet and hee knowes what vse to make of them fourthly by this gift the childe of god can discerne the things of god namely his own election vocation adoptio iustificatio ampc he can know the amp perceiue the more or lesse in a word by this me are able to put a differece between earthly riches and heauenly treasure he can discerne the excellencie of heauenly things aboue earthly and put a plaine difference betweene them which the carnall man can not doe the spirituall man discernes all things truely vertue from vice heauenly things from earthly things and so all other things whatsoeuer heere then marke what is the first action and property of this wisedome to discerne things that differ i adde further this the prouidence wisdome and iustice of god in all things which the naturall man cannot do hereby you see how excellent and necessarie a thing this is seruing to many excellent vses the second action is to iudge determine amp giue sentence of things what we must doe and what we must not doe what is good and what is euill what is heauenly and what is earthly heere one thing must bee remembred it is a principall point of wisedome to determine what is the chiefe happines of man and the scope vnto which all our life is to bee directed it is the loue and fauour of god in christ see examples of this iudgement psalm many say who will shew vs any good ampc marke there dauids iudgement of this matter and how he differs from others he determines that it is true happinesse to bee in the fauour of god so paul cared for nothing but christ crucified shewing what was his wisedome when he came amongst the wisest of the world viz christ crucified for the sinnes of the world and indeede if a man had all the wisedome and policie in the earth and faile in this if hee cannot determine where to place his happinesse and what is the scope of his life his wisedome is but folly therefore remember this is a principall point of true wisedome to bee able to iudge of our true happines what it is and the scope of our life thus you see the spirituall wisedome hath two actions amp what they be viz first to discerne things that differ secondly to discerne onething from another spiritually heere marke further that a principall part of this wisedome is heauenly prouidence when a man discernes what is the principall good then commeth prouidence and vseth all meanes for the compassing of that principall good she forecasteth all the waies and means to come vnto it without this our wisedome is not perfect and thus you see what is meant by wisdome it is a gift of god spirit to the that be in christ whereby they are enabled to discerne of things that differ amp the scope of our life amp of true happines and withal to forethinke and forecast all the means to come vnto it and the single eye that is the single minde which is able to discerne of this wisedome now in the next place mark the fruite of it the whole body shall be light that is the whole life shalbe full of righteousnes amp of good successe prou my fruite is better then gold and fined siluer i make a man walke in the wayes of righteousnes and the paths of iudgement to make some vse of it considering this is thus heere commended wee are first admonished to labour for this heauenly wisedome amp single eye the singular commendation of it should be a spurre and inducement to euery one to seeke for it the commoditie should moue vs to affect it aboue all that you may the better doe it remember two things first that you get the beginning of this wisedome that is the feare of god to reuerence his word and to tremble at his presence which you shall haue if you lay the word to your consciences when you heare and read neuer storme at it when the whole man doeth bow himselfe the minde conscience and will without replying amp repining raging or chafing then wee are gone a good way and haue made good beginnings amp proceedings whe the word checketh vs crosseth amp controlleth our faults striue not against it but obay it secondly wee must all close our eyes the eyes of our minde i meane and suffer our selues to bee led in all things by the written word to bee ordered and ruled by the lawes and commandementes of god marke this poynt for if we can practise this wee shall get true wisedome and happinesse therefore giue attendance to it in the whole course of your liues and let the lord ouerrule you by his word read psalm dauids example is most excellent by meditating in the law he became wiser then the auncient and those that were his teachers he passed them in wisedome that were chiefe among man for wisedome because he shut his owne eyes and submitted himselfe to the regiment of the word in a word remember to renounce thine affections and to shut vp thine eyes amp let the lord performe his worke in thee againe in that the single eie is heere thus commended wee are taught to walke wiselie whereunto paul in most of his epistles exhorteth and wee walke wisely when we practise all things in wisedome amp that is done by remembring these foure things following first the thing to bee done must be iust secondly the means of doing it must be iust also thirdly we must keepe our selues within the limits of our calling fourthly wee must doe it with a single honest and vpright heart and that these foure may concurre wee must haue the written word to tell vs euery one of them we must haue the word to tell vs that the thing wee are to doo is iust that the meanes wee vse is iust also that we do keepe our selues within the limits of our calling and that we do it with a single honest and vpright heart then when our action is iust and the meanes iust the heart vpright and wee within the compasse of our calling according to god word the action shalbe done in wisdome so as it shall be praised and approoued by god thirdly in that this wisedome makes a mans light shine with righteousnesse wee are all taught to season our naturall wisedome with spirituall wisedome god hath giuen all man wisedome by nature more or lesse it is a gift of god to bee commended but that it may be holy and approued and vsed well it must be seasoned and then naturall wisedome ioyned with it is good and a blessing of god and tends to the honour and glory of god it is the sinne of these dayes that man of wisedome vse naturall wisedome without spirituall wisedome whereby they fall into many sinnes and inconueniences because they seuer these fourthly seeing this is so let vs haue regard principally to this part of wisedome which is concerning prouidence after iudgement which is best how to forecast how wee may come by it consider luke the what was the rich mans fault his riches encreased and he was prouident to lay vp his store yet christ calles him foole because he wanted this heauenly wisedome he could forecast for the inlarging of his barnes but not for his soule he had no respect of it nor regard of this spirituall wisedome and prouidence it was the fault of the foolish virgin therefore called foolish they had some oyle and blazing lampes but they wanted sufficiencie of oyle because they wanted this prouidence they had not a sufficient forecast of their saluation and the meanes thereof though one had all the wisedome in the world and faile in this he were but a madde man marke the ende of achytophel his wisedom was great but yet naught because hee wanted the principall viz the feare of god and therefore hee hanged himselfe wherefore consider there can be no wisedome when we do not determine of the ende and scope of our life let vs now in the time of our life and dayes of grace and peace forecast all the meanes of saluation and neuer content our selues till all bee accomplished if wee haue all the learning in the worlde it is nothing without this therefore aboue all things let vs set our hearts to seeke it for the want of it makes man to seeke nothing but earthly treasure because they cannot discerne things that differ wherefore now practise this prouidence learne this wisedome bee not like the foolish virgin content not your selues with outward profession bee not like that rich man that had no care nor forecast of his soule and saluation consider the ende of our life let this bee the first and principall thing for it is the principall parte of heauenly wisedome hitherto of the single eye now of the corrupt and wicked eye as in handling the former so in this i will consider first what is the wicked eye secondly what is the fruit and effect thereof the wicked eye is the mind and vnderstading hauing some light but darkened dimmed and corrupted by adams fall that you may yet the better conceiue what this wicked eye is you must knowe that the minde is corrupted two wayes and in two respects first it hath lost the gift of discerning and iudging and in this respect it is an euill eye and mistakes one thing for an other good for euill and euill for good and that the mind hath lost the gift of discerning in many things appeares thus many of vs by nature knowe not god as wee ought nor our selues touching god it appeares by diverse reasons wee know naturally that there is a god yet we cannot acknowledge the presence of god man naturally when they sinne feare not the presence of god and that proues plainely that the eye of the minde is an euill eye though by nature we know that there is a god yet wee acknowledge not his particular prouidence we cannot discerne it as we should and it appeares in this that man naturally trust man before god the creature aboue the creator which sheweth that we doo not acknowledge a particular presence a for if we did wee would rather distrust man and trust god though the conscience tell a man of the punishment of sinne yet the minde doth sooth and flat vs naturally and telleth vs we shall escape without due punishment and so denyes god iustice we know that god must be worshipped yet the mind cannot discerne amp iudge of it when we come by the light of nature to worship god we turne god to an idoll the naturall man doth not perceiue the things of god that is the minde naturally knowes them not nor giues any approbation or consent vnto them now as man cannot knowe god sufficiently by nature so he cannot discerne himself and his owne sinnes wee haue all this euill eye by nature we can not perceiue that we are dym and darke sighted not blinde a man by nature cannot discerne the vilenesse of sinne though the conscience can iudge somewhat of it yet the right iudgement of sinne the minde cannot perceiue by nature for if man could doo this they would not sinne we are not able by the natural eye of our vnderstanding to iudge of our owne frailtie hence it is that the aged man thinkes he may yet liue longer because the mind is corrupted wee cannot discerne the frailenesse of our owne eyes wee cannot iudge aright of the scope of our owne liues but nature teacheth vs to seeke our selues more then god or our owne good more then his glory the mind is vnable to iudge of our owne happinesse for this is all the wisedome of man to think that felicitie doth consist in outwarde and earthly things as riches honour ampc so that wee account the rich happie and the poore miserable therefore the first point is cleare that the minde hath lost the gift of iudging and discerning the second way that man is corrupt is in obedience that it is made subiect to that which should be subiect to it namely the flesh yes it doth not onely follow the flesh but also the euill temptatios of sathan which are cast into it the minde is ready to follow them and therefore it is euill it followeth the example of the world and for these causes christ calleth it an euill eye first because it wanteth iudgement secondly because it obeyeth that which it should rule totum corpus tenebrae now he shewes the fruite of it which is to make the whole body darke that is the whole life full of vnrighteousnesse and darknesse though the naturall vnderstanding haue some light yet it is an euill eye it cannot discerne in many things and though it discerne in many things yet it obeyeth not but followeth the will thus much of the meaning now of the instructions which truly and naturally proceede from hence first alway remember this that christ left somewhat to be supplyed namely that this euill eye is in all man by nature and that is the cause why man cannot discerne wherefore wee are to labour to see and discerne this wickednesse of the eye in the minde it is the first steppe to knowledge to see that wee cannot see that wee cannot iudge and discerne of heauenly things as we ought wee shall neuer knowe god aright nor our selues till wee see that wee cannot see also wee must bewayle this blindnesse and tremble for it the sense and apprehension of bodily darkenesse is grieuous vnto vs much more ought this and as that ampc so wee ought to labour for the good eye salue that makes the blind eye to bee a good eye and this salue is nothing else but the word of god applyed by the spirit of god when the holy ghost opens the eyes of the vnderstanding then our eyes will bee made single secondly wee are taught to amend a fault wee haue heere iust occasion to rebuke a damnable fault which is common heere and euery where namely that man cotent themselues with the light of nature for by this euill eye any man knoweth thus much namely all this we know by nature if a man were brought vp in the wildernesse he might know all this without a teacher and yet herein stands all the knowledge that many haue but all this is nothing wherefore content not your selues with this thinke not your selues good schollers in christs schoole vntill you knowe more then this comes to that it is not sufficient to knowe these things it is manifest because it is here called an euill eye and makes the life full of darkenesse for all this if wee doo no more then this with this wee may perish liue in darkenesse and dye in darknesse and goe to euerlasting darkenesse and though some pleade that preachers can teach them no more then this yet they deceiue themselues grossely therefore remember this with naturall knowledge ioyne spirituall knowledge put grace to nature to helpe the blinde eye adde pietie and supernaturall knowledge to nature for this cause haue care to reade and search the scriptures that you may attaine to more knowledge then you haue by nature if it be for nothing else but to knowe god commaundements and promises for that knowledge serues for nothing else but to make a man without excuse and not to saue this fault and sinne is the fall and bane of many a soule and brings them to hell that man thinke themselues furnisht sufficiently for saluation if they haue but a naturall knowledge man content themselues with reformation so farre forth as nature teacheth and looke what nature teacheth the verie blinde eye seeth first that god must be worshipped the blind eie seeth and knoweth but how hee is to bee worshipped he cannot tell secondly that we must loue god and liue wel amp deale iustly is knowne by nature and this we cotent our selues withall euen with evil conuersation and naturall reformation but this is not inough for the blinde eye cannot teach vs so much and they learne it and knowe it whose liues are nothing but darknesse wherfore neuer content your selues with naturall reformation for if you haue no more all your ciuill life is nothing but darkenesse before god how faite soeuer it seeme to man but labour for a spirituall life that thy heart may be renued and thy life reformed according to the gospell that this is necessarie it is plaine because christ saith the whole body is darke without it the blinde eye is not able to free it from darkenesse ciuilitie wil neuer saue thee thou must perish with it to proceed we learne that we must not be wise in the matter of saluation for our selues and by our selues the lord saith by moses to the israelites thou shalt not do that which is good in thine owne eyes but that which i commaund thee deut wee must not take vpon vs to set downe how we would be saued and by what meanes this way or that way for wee haue but a blinde eye and yet this hath beene and is a common fault the turke with his religion the iew his and the papist his and there is no man but he prescribes to himselfe a way of worshipping god and how hee will be saued and by this the diuell destroyes many because they will bee wise by themselues and to themselues for example sake it is the manner of wise man to prescribe how they will bee saued they take it for a small matter to come to saluation if they can but make a prayer at the ende of their life i speake of them which are not guided by the word some by their workes and others by their faith and all is one for they vnderstand nothing by faith but theyr good intent and well meaning naturally and commonly man prescribe to themselues how they will be saued amp how they will worship god and in vsing what meanes they will liue and dye but they doo ill wherefore in a word bee not wise to thy selfe in this for the matter of thy saluation let god be wise be thou a foole prescribe no religion to thy selfe content thy selfe to bee wise according to the word for by nature thou hast an euill eye and this eye cannot shewe thee the way of life away therefore with this damnable practise lastly our dutie is to seeke for a better eye that is the eye of faith that which is wanting in this eye may bee supplyed and this is faith by which wee rest on the mercie amp goodnesse of god on his prouidence and protection in life and death this eye is able to see a farre off and to discerne things that cannot otherwise be discerned the euidece of things not seene and the patriarkes sawe the promises a farre off let vs all be careful to seeke this eie of faith without the which wee cannot walke the way to euerlasting life so much of the secod kinde of eye now of the third eye briefly according to the compasse of the time wherfore if the light that is in thee ampc this is the blinde eye yes starke blinde that hath no power to discerne or iudge that is to see what is meant by light naturall knowledge of god and iustice which is in the minde it is further said that if this light be darkenesse it is onely buried so as there shall be no vse of it but it cannot be quite put out amp extinguished some light of nature is remaining in the most wicked man because conscience remaineth now heere it is said to bee none but darknesse because it may be buried hid amp couered but not wholy put out the veriest atheist that liues hath this light in him this must bee remembred for the vnderstanding of these words as it is plaine in them that haue a reprobate minde they are as if they had no light of nature remaining because it is buried what is the cause that the light of nature is turned into darknesse the cause is in the will and affections of man the desires and lusts of the heart it is sinne that puts out the light of nature actuall sinne the will and affections make man to sinne against the light of nature and against conscience and so put out both and burie them this makes a man not to know that which by nature hee might know now see the fruite of it rom in most horrible and brutish sinnes vpon the blinde minde and reprobate sense the consideration of this point that the vnderstanding may be quite buried by actuall sinne teacheth vs to enter into an examination of our selues wee haue in vs euen the best of vs all wretched diuellish and damnable desires such as would put out the light of nature in the vnderstanding this teacheth vs to bee vile in our owne eyes who haue such vile hearts that they can put out that light which adams fall did not secondly in that the will and affection blinde the mind dazell and dimme the light of our vnderstanding we learne to looke to these principally that they bee mortified and brought in subiection to the obedience of god commandements for now the case is altered before the fall the mind ruled the will but now the will ouerrules the minde therfore a speciall regard must be had of this wee must renounce our owne wils and affections they are those that bring the ruine of the soule and conscience therefore aboue all things looke to them that they bee tempered ordered and squared it is best with man when god breaketh them of theyr wills for when they haue their wils in all things of this life they carrie the whole man headlong like a wilde and vntamed colte though thou hadst all the wisedome knowledge and learning in the world if thy will and affection bee naught they will cast a myst a vaile and a couer or scarfe ouer it wherefore bring these into order and subiection then a little vnderstanding out of the word will giue great light remember this it is not knowledge principally that should bee sought for or the minde to be instructed and no more but the wil and affection must especially be regarded for from the heart comes life and death saluation or damnation there is the beginning of thy comfort or woe for if they be out of order they will maister amp ouerrule the vnderstanding further i gather hence that the doctrine of saluation may bee turned to darkenesse if the light of nature which is so deeply imprinted amp engraue in the heart then much more this and this is plaine by experience of all them which begin in the spirit and ende in the flesh which are worldly amp wicked this could not be otherwise see heb there is a most excellent place of scripture which dooth shewe how this light by little and little is put out going backe from the last to the first there bee fiue degrees then furthermore there is declared how wee hauing receiued the light of the gospell may preserue it namely by obseruing and watching the liues of one an other and by exhorting one an other lastly if the light of nature may be turned into darknesse it may be demaunded whether sauing grace and faith may bee lost if the light of nature which is so deeply imprinted in the heart may be extinguished why may not the grace of regeneration be lost there is no grace of god considered in it selfe but it may be lost for it is a creature and therefore changeable because nothing is vnchangeable but god wherefore if you consider faith and regeneration in their owne nature they are changeable and may be lost it cannot be denied but in regard of the promise of god to continue and preserue it to vs then it is vnchangeable and cannot be lost god gaue adam grace but it was changeable hee did determine to permit the fall but now the gifts and graces of god are without repentance and the man that is a beleeuer shall neuer bee mooued psalm though the nature of grace bee such that it may bee lost yet god giues the second grace to the first and thereby it is made sure that it shall not bee moued or lost the gates of hell shall not preuaile against the church by reason hereof vpon this and such like promises it is that faith is not lost and not by any vertue which it hath in it selfe or by it owne nature let this bee the first aunswere secondly as i said this light of nature cannot be quite put out but onely buried so faith may bee buried hidden and driuen into some corner but it cannot bee wholy put out where it is once truly kindled so much of the third eye in which the light of nature seemes to bee quite put out because it cannot discerne at al but takes euill for good and good for euill it seeth not so much as there is a god or that god is to bee worshipped now to come to the verie scope of these words marke the ende of them why christ vsed them it was to shewe that man could not discerne when they seeke for earthly riches before heauenly and the euill eye corrupt and blinde by nature is the cause why man cannot distinguish things that differ from the scope one profitable admonition must bee renued that is to labour to attaine the gift of discerning to put a differece between earthly and heauenly things therefore let vs search the scripture that we may haue our eyes enlightned and so see the right way to eternall life for the want of this discerning is the cause of all disorder and particularly of this disorder in preferring temporall and earthly things before eternall and heauenly and by this you may walke with comfort and peace of conscience the way to life eternall whereas without it you wander in darknesse all the dayes of your life we haue heard of two commaundements of christ first negatiue in the verse the second affirmatiue in the verse and afterward an obiection answered in the verse now hee remoues another impediment the former obiection was this if our treasure must bee laid vp in heauen and not heere on earth it is maruell that so many lay vp treasure heere and not in heauen the answere hereof is they haue either a blinde eye or an evil eye and so want the gift of discerning now in this verse he meetes with an other obiection which the carnall wisedome of man makes commonly and hath euer made against these commaundements and it is thus why may wee not loue and serue god and serue mammon too some man flat and perswade themselues that they may serue god amp yet set their hearts to seeke riches too and therefore they thinke that they may seeke earthly riches amp heauenly riches both together and that one doth not hinder an other but that one may haue both treasure in earth and treasure in heauen here therefore christ meetes with this carnall conceit of naturall man and proues it to be impossible that one man should practise both these thus you see how this verse doth depend on the former and this will the better appeare if we seeke the true meaning of the words no man can serue two maisters ampc it may seeme at the first to be otherwise for both in reason and also by experience one servant may serue two diverse masters as we see one factor may and dooth well serue diueser merchant therefore how can this bee that christ saith here some answere it thus that the words must bee conceiued after this manner as if hee had said two diverse or contrarie maisters as for example when one shall say come and an other shall say come not when two maisters are thus cotrary amp diverse in their mindes and wills one servant cannot serue both and so these words carrie a holy truth but this clause of diverse and contrary is not exprest therefore i say further that this sentence was a common prouerbe among them now in a prouerbe if it be vsually or generally true though it holde not alwaies if it haue effect ordinarily it is inough as no prophet is honoured in his owne countrey that is vsually and commonly it is so so this prouerbe is true ordinarily and thus this sentence must be vnderstood as a familiar prouerbe vsuall and common among the iewes which christ taketh for the ground of his speech now it followeth for eyther hee shall hate the one that is as he is a maister or in regard of his commaundement and hee shall loue the other in respect of his commaundement in that hee doth embrace it and performe it or else hee shall leane to the one this is an illustration of the former words for it might bee demaunded how shall hee bee knowne to loue or hate them the answere is thus loue will cleaue to the one and contemne the other that is a servant is knowne to loue his maister in his commaundement first if he cleaue vnto him secondly if he giue himselfe as a servant to the obedience of his commaundement and he will despise the other that is hee will neglect his commaundements thus hee testifieth his loue or hatred by omitting and neglecting or by performing and practising the commaundements enioyned him now the words that follow you cannot serue god and mammon are the application of the argument you cannot serue god and riches treasure profit gaine a man cannot serue god and giue himselfe to get and lay vp riches it is not said you cannot serue god and haue riches for abraham ioseph amp iob serued god and yet had riches but thus you cannot serue god amp serue riches that is giue your selues to seeke them and set your hearts vpon them thus the sense and meaning is plaine and now the scope of the words wil the better appeare the obiection is this why may we not do both viz lay vp treasure in heauen and in earth the answere is no man can serue two maisters but god and mammon are two maisters therfore you cannot serue both these the proposition is confirmed by a reason which is added and thus you see the scope and the sense of this verse now see what doctrines naturally arise hence first it is to be marked that christ dooth heere set downe what it is to serue god a thing that euery man speakes much of yet a thing that fewe know and fewer doo practise therefore in a word it is this to serue god is to loue him and to cleaue vnto him and he serueth god that doth these two for the first euery man will say that he loues god and euer did well then take heede you be not deceiued for god must be loued not onely as hee is a bountifull lord but as hee is a maister and doth commaund vs seruice hee must bee loued in his word and commaundements in his authoritie of commaunding the written word is his will and commandement therein he prescribes what we should do though he should neuer bestowe benefites vpon vs that we should loue him because he is our maister for the second part of god seruice it is to cleaue vnto him whereby what is meant you may see in the parable of the prodigall son hee claue to a farmer that is gaue himselfe to his seruice so here to cleaue vnto god is the resigning vp of a mans selfe to serue god and to obey him in euery commandement and to take heed that hee suffer not himselfe to be drawne away from obeying any commaundement and beleeuing any promise this is done when wee will not suffer our selues to be seperated from god but yeeld obedience to his commandements this is the right cleauing to god contrariwise to disobey his commaundements is to hate god amp to despise him though no man will say he hates god yet hee that dooth neglect his commaundements and giues himselfe to seeke the things of this life is a hater of god he that is crooked in his way despiseth god let him protest what he will if he do not cleaue vnto god by obedience to his commaundements hee is a hater of god amp his vtter enemie the consideration of this part serues to let you vnderstand the great blindnesse of the world for commonly if a man can but rehearse the lord praier the ten comandements and the creede howsoeuer he liue he serues god wel inough what grosse ignorance blindnesse and superstition is this the seruice of god is in obedience to his commandements to cleaue vnto him as abraham did when god said thou shalt not kill hee obeyed againe when god said kill thy son he obeyed see the how this age abounds with atheisme in all places for what is hee that hateth god and despiseth him but an atheist now all they that seek the things of this life so much they are very atheists and no better because they hate him and despise him atheisme is a common sin of our time the world is loued mammon embraced god hated and the lord despised i know that man will abhorre this to bee challenged for atheists but christ hath giuen the sentence that whosoeuer he bee that doth not cleaue vnto him in obedience doth despise and hate god and what is that but atheisme this is a mother sin amp the cause of many more so much of the first poynt of the seruice of god secondly christ takes it for graunted that mammon is a lord that riches is a god and that man serue and obey him as there is a true god and maister by right of creation so there is an other by reason of corruption and that is riches treasure profit and gaine of this he forewarnes his disciples because the daunger is great how can this bee may some say riches in it selfe is a good creature of god and therefore is not indeed a maister onely the wicked and wretched hart of man sets vp an idoll in the heart in stead of the true god and therefore couetousnesse is called idolatry now it is made an idoll amp a master thus man esteeme of riches as of theyr principall happinesse and it is the minde of man that makes the god looke where the heart is there is the lord and god secondly it is the nature of man to trust in riches and to loue the more the god hence it is that man are the servant of riches whereof they should be maisters i will make it plaine that it cannot be denied first me lay aside the seruice of god amp neglect his worship for gaine what argues this but that they account riches the principall good about which they spend most time secodly let a man haue riches and he is content exceedingly with the abundance that god giues him he is at peace let the same man loose his goods and all the promises in the bible will not quiet him againe let him loose any part of his riches amp he will be more grieued and vexed then for the losse of heauen by breaking god commandements what argues this but that the hearts of man do honor riches as their god lastly i appeale to all mens consciences is not euery man more sharpely set to gather earthly things then to call vpon god why all man can tell euery one is more eager and earnest in seeking riches so that wee haue as many idols now as euer we had and as many idolaters for euery man sets vp this idoll in his heart and puts his trust in it therefore it is true which christ takes for graunted that riches is a lord if any think themselues hardly dealt withall that they shuld bee accounted mammonists and idolaters seruing riches let them consider the liues of man what meane else the common oppressions extortions vsuries ingrossing of necessaries what doo all these argue but this that mammon is a great lord and hath many servant and slaues for all these are his attendants and retainers vnto him further what is the cause of a dearth in time of plentie whe god in mercie hath vouchsafed vs plentie and store what is the cause our dearth continues but this that mammon is a great lord mammon is the cause gaine and lucre let it be considered with reuerence when we haue a made famine by the wicked man who are slaues and vassals of mammon there is no question but the dearth in former yeares which was caused by god hand was also encreased by wicked man all these things being laid together and considered it is plaine that though all man would seeme to embrace the gospell yet this is a common sinne man giue themselues to serue mammon indeede god hath his servant here and elsewhere yet it is but an handfull the multitude are all mammonites therfore this is a certaine truth and may well be taken for graunted here therefore see the vile nature of man he was made to be lord of mammon amp yet he is content to become his slaue and vassall though his state and condition be to be a lord yet thus he abaseth himselfe secondly in that man are commonly slaues to mammon we learn an other lesson which christ teacheth vs wee must learne to be faithfull in the hauing vsing keeping and dispensing of the wicked mammon it is a vile and a miserable thing for a man to subiect himselfe to it to become his slaue and vassall he that seekes to be rich forsakes god remeber it for it is the principal point that christ proues here a man may haue riches and vse them and may liue amp die rich but he may not seeke to be rich because then he forsakes god when hee sets his hart vpon riches i wil make this more plaine in riches three things are to be cosidered first the getting secodly the keeping thirdly the spending first hee that seeks to be rich in getting of goods must needs vse much lying deceiuing and breaking the sabboth in keeping of them if persecutiocome he forsakes christ and denies the gospell and if any losse befall him he will resort to the witch wisard southsayer coniurer and astrologer and all to keepe himselfe rich againe he can part with nothing to the poore because hee must be rich therfore he cannot spare a penny none shall get ought at his hands they may starue at his doore first and all is because he will be rich hee hath set it downe and determined it with himselfe man haue a milde amp moderate opinio of couetousnes if a man be couetous they will say hee is a good honest man but somewhat hard and neere but marke the sentence of christ here these worldly persons are forsaken of god so that it is no small fault as the world takes it for a man to be worldly first it is a renouncing of god himselfe a practising of atheisme therefore we must learne to thinke worse of these worldly persons secondly it is the manner of man to make lawes to themselues for the getting of riches i wil haue an or or or if he haue a greater stocke a or ampc and thus much lands rents and reuennewes i must needes haue it i cannot liue else take heede of this make no such lawe to your selues for then follow all the practises that tend to the compassing of this resolution it is a commo practise among man they will haue thus much in stocke and thus much in reuenewes whereas indeed a little with god blessing is wealth inough thirdly let euery man bee contented with that portion which god hath allotted him euermore remember that godlinesse is great gaine if wee be content therefore away with this couetous minde and bee content with god good prouidence the heart must not bee deuided betweene god and the creature god must haue all or none you cannot serue both there is no parting of stakes god to haue one part and mammon the other many are deceiued herein who thinke they may part stakes and giue god one halfe and the creature the other nay sinne and sathan the vse of this is to discouer hypocrites when man liue in many sinnes if they come to the congregation to heare and pray and receiue the sacrament though they lye and liue in sinne they may bee the servant of god for all that as the drunkard adulterer ampc and so euery man blesseth himselfe in his sinne hence it is that so many flat themselues while they liue in sin against their owne conscience but they deceiue themselues if they serue the diuell in any sinne they cannot serue god secondly euerie servant of god is so far forth regenerate renued and sanctified that not one sin raignes in him for then he must serue two maisters so many sinnes raigning in any man so many lord this doctrine must be receiued regarded reuerenced amp remembred thirdly if the heart cannot bee deuided betweene god and the creature let vs all in the feare of god worship god serue him and professe our selues to bee his servant with our whole soules and body for we cannot serue god and mammon god alone is to bee serued therefore let euerie affection bow the knee to god let the bodie and soule doo theyr parts in this homage so long as thou liuest remember rom the servant of god hath his fruite in holinesse and the ende euerlasting life the queene of sheba pronounced the servant of salomon happie because they serued such a lord how much more the are they happie who in body and soule giue themselues to the seruice of the liuing god it will be said i desire with all my heart to serue god but the corruption of my nature makes mee disobey and rebell against the commaundements of god the flesh makes mee doo that which i would not when i would faine honour god my corrupt nature makes me dishonour him some may thus complaine that their case is miserable and they serue two maisters all that haue grace must needes say thus that their wicked nature doth carrie them an other way but they must stay their mind on this maner whe they faile in obedience let them consider whether they do it willingly or against their wills thou wilt say vnwillingly and it grieues thee and thou article displeased with thy selfe well if thou canst say this bee of good courage thou doest not serue two maisters though there bee in thee two contraries flesh and grace yet they are not two maisters therfore bee not discouraged for thou seruest not both thou seruest god and not the flesh nay if thou faile in obedience and be grieued for it god doth accept thy will and endeuour for the deede remember this for euerie childe of god may say i serue two maisters but it is against my will and with griefe of heart with groning vnder this bondage labour and endeuour to keepe a good conscience and then if thou faile it is because thou article ouerruled and maistered walke in all the wayes of god and the wants and defects of thy nature are all couered in the death of christ if thou doest thine endeuour to obey search the scripture where the will of this maister is set downe and when thou knowest what his wil amp commandements are endeuour to obey them and thou shalt bee the servant of god thy seruice is a kingdome it is a true libertie but contrariwise serue mammon and thy ende will be euerlasting destruction in hell at the verse christ began to forbid couetousnes and because man are ready to make many excuses and obiections therfore christ hath answered two before now he proceedes and strikes at the roote of couetousnesse which is immoderate and inordinate care for y e things of this life and his intent is to remoue that yes the distrustfull care of things necessarie and this he doth to the ende of the chapter he labours to take away the cause of all couetousnesse these words depend on the former from the verse as i take it and they are a conclusion of all the doctrine deliuered before from the verse and not from the onely in this manner seeing they want a good eye and the gift of wisedome amp discerning therefore i say yet further to you be not careful more then needs for things necessary thus these words depend on the former and withall hee meetes with a conceit of carnall man for man might say they seeke not treasure but only things necessarie thus might the couetous plead and therefore christ comes home to them and saith be not carefull with any immoderate or inordinate care for so much as meate drinke and cloathing ampc so much shall suffice for the scope and coherence now let vs consider the words the sense and the vse of them therefore i say vnto you in that christ begins his commandement on this maner therefore i say vnto you i that am your maister on whom you depend for all heauenly instruction he doth prepare them to attention and to a diligent marking of this commaundement and instruction and he vseth this forme of speech to declare that the commaundement following is a waightie thing and to be regarded and obeyed and which if it be kept couetousnesse cannot seize on vs and this is the substance and pith of all this doctrine and this clause prefixed must be a warning to vs to marke the doctrine therefore let vs see what it is be not carefull when hee saith bee not carefull what yee shall eate ampc the commandement must be considered least it bee mistaken therefore the true sence is to bee searched out there bee two kindes of care the first is commended in diverse places wisedome sends to the ant to learne diligence amp prouidence in earthly things and the place of paul is well knowne he that is not prouident for himselfe and his is worse then an infidell where the holy ghost commends vnto vs a prouident care and circumspection for the things of this life therefore there is a lawful care and it is this when man walke in their callings and doo the duties of it diligently with good and vpright dealing to euerie man minding to seeke no more then is necessarie in the iudgement of all man for this life this is one principall point of this godly care the second point after wee haue vsed due diligence is to leaue the successe and issue to god wee must leaue the disposing of our labours to the lorde for it belongs to god and is proper to him to dispose of the successe and euent of our labours wee must not frame the successe to our selues how we wil haue it but referre it and our selues to god good prouidence take moses for an example hee was called to be a deliuerer of the israelites out of egypt hee obeyes god commaundements and comes when he is called and goes when he is sent and doth his endeuour to bring them from egypt to canaan and though he had many crosses yet hee goes forward and leaues the successe to god as wee see exod when hee was driuen into such straites that hee had the sea before him hills on the one side and woods on the other hee saith feare not but stand still and behold the saluation of the lord so abraham beeing commaunded to sacrifice his son isaac obeyes and goes about it and when isaack asked him where the sacrifice was hee saith god will prouide therefore in a word the godly care is when man do the workes of their callings with diligence leauing the successe of their labours to god this care is of the dutie onely and not of the successe and this is not here condemned but the second kinde is a distrustfull care which doubteth of god prouidence when man doo the workes of theyr callings diligently but so as they distrust god prouidence and dare not commend and commit the fruite and euent thereof to god this is a distrustfull and an unlawful care that you may the better conceiue of it it hath these fruites following first it oppresseth the heart with feare and griefe with feare of pouertie and want and so filles the heart with griefe note secondly when man keepe not themselues to the word of god and lawful meanes but vse unlawful meanes to get theyr liuings with note thirdly when man are so carefull for the worlde that they neglect prayer and the seruice of god in hearing the word the heart is ouerladen and oppressed and it argues that there is care not onely for the dutie but for the successe which belongs to god and thus you see what a distrustfull care is and this is the care that is heere forbidden when man distrust god and vse unlawful meanes to enrich themselues it is a care that is ioyned with neglect of god worship and with griefe and feare for the greeke worde dooth signifie such a care as distracts the minde deuides it and brings it into perplexitie so that it is as much as if hee had said bee not carefull in such sort that your mindes be troubled and perplexed his meaning is not to forbid labour or lawful care for then hee should speake against all callings so much of the sense and meaning of this heauenly commandement now let vs apply it to our selues that which is here forbidden is the common sinne of most man now and it is not in a fewe but it is a common and ordinarie thing it lurkes in the heart and shewes it selfe in the life one kinde of ground receiueth the seede but when it springs vp it is choked with worldly cares and this is common among vs and therefore the world hath so little fruite if wee would examine our selues what profit amp proceedings we haue made in christs schoole we should see little fruite for this immoderate care doth deuide the heart and distract the minde worldly cares tosse it and turne it like the waues of the sea this is one argument of it and an euident proofe that this sinne is common secondly there is no trade or calling but it hath conueances of craft and deceit though the practises of man bee not commonly knowne yet the thing is certainly true and manifest he that hath but halfe an eye may see into the abuses which are daily practised and it is hard to finde them that seeme religious to make conscience of this in their callings and to auoyde the common crafts what argues this but that our hearts are possest with immoderate care wee depend not on god prouidence wee dare not trust him with the successe wee feare he wil not giue so good a blessing as wee looke for now christ giues vs warning of this amp doth command vs to take heede of it that wee haue no distrustfull care so much as for things necessarie what must we do then our dutie is declared elsewhere see a most excellent commandement it is repeated by dauid ps and ps and by salomon prou and by peter i is a most waightie instruction and hath this sense walke in thy calling doo the duties of it diligently truly and iustly yet remember when thy labour is done to commit the successe vnto god leaue the blessing to his prouidence the meaning is not to forbid vs to walke in our wayes and to practise the workes of our calling but onely to teach vs to leaue the successe to god to make this more plaine put the case of any trade man he is to practise the workes of his calling as if it be to buy or sell hee may do it with diligence without wronging any but the successe must be referred to god for that take no care but leaue all to him the like commandement we haue philipp be not carefull ampc what then but in all things let your prayers bee made to god with supplication and thankes giuing marke there how care is opposed to prayer and thankes giuing all care is not forbidden there but immoderate care onely we must bee carefull of our duties but not of the successe of our labours for the blessing bee not carefull but commend it to god it is an excellent commaundement to bee remembred and practised of all man in all callings it is the double care that is forbidden thus you see what you are to doo in the compasse of your callings how can we do this it is too hard a commaundement flesh and bloud cannot keepe it do but remember what blessed promises god hath made to them that obey him and we cannot but make conscience to obey this some rise early goe late to bed and yet are neuer the richer but god giues sleepe to his beloued such as obey him shall haue rest and sleepe they shall with quietnesse reape the fruite of their labours the lyons shall be starued but they that feare god shall lacke nothing though the lyons vse rauening and get theyr pray by violence yet they shall want sooner then the children of god if we had no more commandements in all the bible but this it should be sufficient to worke this effect in vs after due labour and diligence vsed in our callings to referre the successe thereof vnto god we ought to trust god and beleeue his promises and not distrust his prouidence if wee will not trust god in these outward things how shall we trust him in the keeping of our soules in time of temptation and in death therefore commend all to god and for the successe liue by faith how if all things goe crosse and we finde no blessing in our labours may we not prouide for our selues cast thy care on the lorde and hee knoweth what is good for thee better then thy selfe wherefore if he denie thee that blessing which thou desirest be content and obedient for the servant of god to bee crost it is better oftentimes then wee are aware of good iosias was puft vp with pride and would needes fight with pharaoh necho without any warrant and it cost him his life for it and good ezechias likewise in a pride shewed the straungers his treasure and was punisht for it therefore if thou want any blessing the best way is to pray for it and to depend vpon god and if god see it to be good for thee thou shalt obtaine thy desire so much of this maine commaundement which is a commaundement alwayes to be remembred and written in our hearts and to bee practised in our liues now one point further is to be marked viz how christ distinguisheth betweene the life and the body hee makes the meat and drinke to appertaine to the life and soule and apparell to the body yet wee know that the apparell is a meanes to preserue the life too as well as meate and drinke and yet christ cocludes it and that for iust cause for though in some country the vse of apparell bee to cherish the bodie and to continue life yet the general and first vse of it is not for the life but it respects a higher matter it serues for the body it selfe i say in respect of a certaine shame that is set vpon it the maiestie of the body is lost and the nakednesse of it is now a thing full of shame and confusion and our apparel serues to couer this shame so the proper and principall ende of apparell is this to couer the bodie in regarde of the shame which befell vs after the fall yes the truth is we should be all couered hands and face and all if it were not for other necessarie vses in regard of which wee keepe them bare and vncouered and if that fall had not bene the naked bodie had bene full of maiestie this point being considered we must learne neuer to be puft vp in regard of our apparell but rather to be abashed and confounded so oft as we put it on or looke vpon it for it is nothing but a badge to couer the shame of our body with therefore it is as great a madnesse for any to be puft vp because of their apparel as it were for a prisoner to be proud of the boults on his legges the brand on his hand or the hole in his care therfore we must learne to thinke of our sinne when we looke on our apparel and to be abashed abased and humbled in remembrance of it we must expresse all the graces and gifts of god that be in vs so much as we can euen in our apparel as sobrietie temperance frugalitie amp such like they are to be declared in the very garments so much of that point now it followeth is not the life more worth ampc after he had giuen a most excellent comandement to the end it may not goe without his effect hee enforceth it with diverse argumets of waight first saying is not the life more worth then meate ampc the reason stands thus the life is more excellent the meate and drinke and the body is better then the apparell now god giues the life and the body and dooth preserue them therefore he will much more giue foode and apparell the reason is taken from the creation he that is a creator will preserue his worke in this reason christ teacheth vs how wee should make vse of our creation by a consideration of it wee must learne to come to a confidence of god prouidence and to trust in him for all the things of this life for hee will preserue his workmanship iob in the beginning of his tenth chapter perswades himselfe that the lord will not destroy him because hee is the workemanship of his handes hee makes that an argument marke what vse hee makes of his very creation commend your selues to god as to a faithfull creator saieth s peter pet marke that hee calles god a faithfull creator and for that cause wee must commend our selues vnto him we see also by commo experience that no man is so tender and carefull for any thing as is the workeman therfore in this respect we are to put our trust in god hath god giuen vs life and a body and wil he not giue vs foode and rayment it cannot be thus god teacheth vs his prouidence by the creation and confidence in it heere is a second reason of the commaundement be not carefull for such necessaries for if god feede the fowles much more will he do you the proposition is confirmed thus because you haue meanes and they haue none againe you are better then they for you are god children and so are not they therfore if hee feede them much more will he do you a very good reason which may induce all man to obey the commandement for it is a very sensible reason and may easily be vnderstood of all before he proposeth his reason hee bids vs beholde them that is to looke vpon them wisely with consideration for so the word signifieth here is a generall dutie to be learned namely to consider the workes of god for this may be said of all the creatures beholde them the duty therefore is to marke them and to view them well that we in them may see the wisedome goodnesse mercy iustice and prouidence of god salomo giues the same lesson to consider the workes of god god made one creature after an other seuerally in daies and rested the and sanctified it one cause was that me might cosider seuerally of these works of god our rest must be consecrated to the cosideratio of the workes of god the heauen is copared to a great booke which all may read ps and so we may say of all the creatures so many creatures as there be in y e world so many bookes wherin we may read sesibly amp distinctly the power wisdome amp goodnesse of god therefore wee ought to looke vpon them and euen to spell them out till we can read them perfectly now what is the thing to bee looked vpon in the they sowe not neineither reape they haue not that care for meate and drinke which we haue me do this and that sowe amp reape by god comandemet amp their labour is approued the birds doo not so much they take no care at all how then do they liue the yong rauens cry to god for foode and the lyons seeke to him amp the eyes of all things looke vp to him how can this be can the vnreasonable creatures do so it cannot be that which the holy ghost saith hath his sence meaning and force for they do not vse prayer indeed as man doo but that which man do by prayer they do the same in their kinde by a natural instinct imprinted in them by their creatio they seeke the foode that god hath ordained for them and rest cotented with his prouidence and so they call vpon god and depend on him and therefore the holy ghost hath of purpose vsed these phrases to shew how they content themselues with god prouidence here marke one point the creatures are subiect to vanity amp corruptio by the sin of man and yet they come nearer the first state then man and the order of nature remaines in them for this is their part by order of creation and it is to be seene in them to this day but man is fallen from the order set in his creation euen in these temporall things whether we regard the getting or the keeping or the dispending of them man are grown to a distrustfull care against the will and prouidence of god this point is to be marked that the other creatures keepe the order of nature in this thing amp man doth not which sheweth that man is more vile then baser creatures and more corrupt then they for they keepe the lawe of nature this serues to humble vs and to make vs thinke basely of our selues who haue not in vs by nature that good which they haue yet your heauely father feedeth the heere be excellent pointes set downe which i will but touch first heere is a reason why we ought to rest on god prouidence and afterwarde a way shewed whereby we may doe it there be two kindes of promises in the word first of spirituall and eternall things secondly of corporall temporal and external things now how may we put our trust in god for these temporall things thus we must take holde of the maine promise of saluation and reconciliatio with god in christ and when we are resolued of that then we shal begin to beleeue the promises of temporal things and rest vpon the goodnes of god so that if you would knowe how to put your trust in god for these things you must first labour for this to be assured by faith that you are the childre of god and recociled in christ this is the right way amp the ground of all to beleeue our adoption amp reconciliation and where this is not there can be no true trust in his prouidence so much as for a bit of bread further mark here a special amp particular prouidence of god the birds prouide nothing for themselues and therefore in all reaso they should perish in winter yet daily experience sheweth this that they are both fatter and in better liking in winter this argues that there is a god that doth feede them and a particular prouidence which tends vpo the least foule and brings it meate in winter this is a sensible perswasio to all god servant that god wil send them foode and rayment for can it be possible that god should feede the foules and neglect his children again this serues not to boulster vp any mas idlenes amp negligence that wil neither reape nor sowe but to teach vs that when all meanes faile we must rest vpon god in a word we must learne here to be like god to be mercifull as he is mercifull he is a sauiour of all specially of them that beleeue this was neuer more needfull to be learned then now whe man make them selues rich euen with the blood of the poore if we be god children we must be like him we haue heard the commandement in the verse and two reasons of it first if god giue life and the body much more foode and rayment secondly if he feede the fowles much more will he feede you now followeth a third reason to moue vs to obey the commaundement the words are propounded by way of interrogation and it is the maner of the holy ghost to affirme or deny something and that more effectually vnder the forme of an interrogation and this is all one as if hee had said there is not one of you that by taking care can adde one cubit vnto his stature the cubit here mentioned is a certaine kinde of measure borrowed from a mans arme which is the length from the bowing of the arme or elbowe to the end of the longest finger about which length wee are commonly when we come into the world so that the meaning is this as god makes a man a cubit long at the first and afterwards addes many cubits one after another to his stature so man himselfe cannot by all his care encrease his stature one cubit nay all the cunning wit labour amp industrie of man is not able to adde any thing to his stature because it is the proper worke of god and of the same nature with the worke of the creation after a thing is created to make it growe and encrease is a worke that proceedes from the same power by which it was created therefore as none but god doth or can create the body so it is god alone that encreaseth the stature and addes length and makes it grow from stature to stature and so this is a reason from the like as man by taking care cannot encrease his stature one cubit no nor any thing at all as it is in luke so he cannot by taking care encrease his worldly state or better it this is the sum and substance of this reason and it is very forcible and effectuall to make vs vse moderate care and to moue vs to put away distrustful care so much as for necessaries for wee can no more encrease our mainteinance by taking care then wee can encrease our stature by it which is impossible to any creature and so much for the sense of this verse now let vs see what doctrines and instructions arise fro the wordes all our labour care and industrie is altogether vaine amp vnprofitable cosidered a part from the blessing of god and his prouidence ps all the paines that man take for the things of this life is but lost labour without god blessing the planter and waterer is nothing if such excellent man as they were that were the founders of the church laboured in vaine without god blessing much more we this is the first point which teacheth vs one speciall dutie alwayes to commed our labors to god by praier to offer them vp to him that hee may blesse them because without this all our care and labour is in vaine secondly as god by his decree amp counsel set downe what shall be euery mans stature so he hath set downe in his decree what shall be euery mans successe and worldly state good or badde better or worse god hath decreed it amp set it downe and it is vnchaungeable as a mans stature is whe he is come to his full height this conclusio christ would teach vs here we cannot make our worldlye state better or worse as we will we cannot be high or lowe at our pleasure but we must haue that stature and state which god hath appointed looke what successe he hath appointed shall be and must be we cannot alter it by carking and caring this serues to teach vs to depende vppon god and to rest vppon him in our lawful labours for the successe of them this ouerthrowes diverse fond opinions first that by article and skill a man may prolong his naturall life and make a supply when hee is come to his ende this is false for if a man cannot make himselfe higher nor alter his stature hee cannot enlarge his life for of the two that were the easier viz to encrease his stature rather then to lengthen his life beyond the naturall period therefore man cannot doo this by all his article or wit hee cannot peece out his life and refraine his spirit as ecclesiastes speaketh the soule and the body must be seperated indeede article may preserue life till his naturall ende but when that is come no article can prolong it secondly the opinion that witches and sorcerers can transforme themselues and passe through keye holes is false if they cannot doo this viz adde one cubit to theyr stature much lesse can they do that if they cannot adde so much to their stature how can they chaunge and abolish nature if they cannot encrease nature they cannot chaunge it into an other kinde though sathan hath many illusions yet hee cannot by all his skill turne a mans body into a beastes and it is a forgery to say that nabuchadnezzers bodie was changed into a beast but only he had a phrensie and became lik a beast thirdly they are deceiued and deceiue that say they can by article turne baser mettalles into better as brasse into gold a creature of one kinde into an other if this be not possible viz to adde one cubit ampc no more is that likewise wee must remember that all these things are the worke of the creator and a man can no more doo them then hee can increase his owne stature which hee can neuer do if this be so that we cannot adde ampc then it is false which the papists teach that a man may be glorified and iustified and increase his glory in heauen by his workes he cannot doo it for it requires a greater power to increase glory in heauen then to increase the stature of the body as it is the worke of god to giue stature and to increase it so it is his worke to giue glory and to increase it and if man cannot do that which is lesse in nature how shall they do that which is aboue nature the meaning is and do not care for rayment the interrogation still hauing the force of a negation or prohibition and heere hee repeates the commaundement before deliuered in the verse yet not altogether but by peece meale he parts it and proues it and vrgeth it point by point what should be his meaning to take this course in handling this heauenly doctrine he shewes himselfe here to be the doctor of the church and proues himselfe a faithfull teacher therefore not content only to propound his doctrine least it should take no fruite or profit in the hearers he vrgeth it point by point that by this meanes hee may set an edge vpon it and make it take place in the hearts of his hearers that it may bee engrauen there and bee effectuall and this is the dutie of all that are enioyned to teach viz to bee carefull to deliuer the will of god and then bee carefull that it may be remembred the father is commaunded to whet his childe as the souldier dooth sharpen his sworde that it may enter into the bodie of the enemie this is the dutie of euerie one to whome it belongs to teach others whether they bee ministers maisters or fathers euery teacher hath his dutie enioyned him first to teach the will of god secondly to set it on an edge so here christ giues example and teacheth by his owne practise first he commaunds then he confirmes and vrgeth it by peece meale and then he repeates the commaundement diverse times so much for the maner and forme of teaching now let vs come to the words as they lye in order and why care you for rayment ampc these wordes must haue the same exposition that the verse had where this doctrine was propounded in generall there is a moderate care for rayment which is not here forbidden but the other that is the inordinate amp immoderate care and it may bee conceiued diuersly first care for rayment is then inordinate when man care not onely for apparell necessarie but for aboundance and superfluitie for that which is more then necessarie as when man desire alwayes to bee in the fashion and to chaunge their apparell as the fashion chaungeth they are carried with an vngodly care secondly when man care for costly apparel beyond their degree state and abilitie that is also inordinate care for apparell example of this also is risen in our time when euery ordinarie man desires to be fine in apparell and no man is content with that which is decent and fit for his calling but the trade man his care is to bee apparelled like the gentleman the gentlema like the knight the knight like the noble man and thus euerie person affects the apparell of a higher state yes euery servant so the times are now spends the greatest part of his wages yes and more then his wages comes to in apparell thirdly when much time is spent in the curious apparelling of the body as though wee could mend the forme of our body and as if the lord had not done his part sufficiently the time and paines might be much better imployed amp spent in matters of saluation now to come to the point christ forbids not here a moderate care for raiment but the inordinate care to prouide apparell superfluous sumptuous and curious which is ioyned with the mispending of much time and money beyond our estate and abilitie now as i said before this inordinate and immoderate care is the common sinne of these times in all places this is manifest and cannot be denied therefore let vs all remember and reuerence this commaundement and take heed that we be not carefull inordinately for rayment now he comes to confirme the comandement by a fourth reaso set downe in this verse and in the and the verses learne how the lillies growe ampc the reason is worthy and excellent though it bee borrowed from sensible things and thus it is framed if god cloathe lillies much more wil he do you ampc the first part is confirmed in the verse thus the lillies and so all the hearbes of the field are ordained for mans vse and for the furnace therefore man is more excellent then they are then if hee cloathe them much more will he cloathe you for they are made for your vse the second part is thus contained in the and verses they are clouthed more gorgiously then salomon nay it is added that god dooth this for hee speakes it of the hearbes of the field not of the garden which are not drest by man againe they labour not that is they themselues are not the causes of it it is not man nor the hearbe it selfe but god alone that cloathes it and hee addes that they are cloathed more then salomon was in all his royaltie the conclusion therefore followeth if god so cloathe them much more you and that with a checke oligopistoi oyee of litle faith thus you see the fourth reason which doth containe many notable instructions now to the words learne of the lillies when he saith this he maketh the lillies and euerie hearbe to bee a schoole maister vnto vs hee sends vs vnto them to learne and though wee be the schollers of christ yet wee must not thinke scorne to learne of them which grow without the hand of man or any labour of their owne and this he doth for speciall causes for first that creature in the field doth more obey god in it kinde then man doth and that the holy ghost dooth often testifie esay heare heauens and hearken ampc and ezechiel spake to the mountaines and the prophet that was sent to reproue ieroboam when hee came where ieroboam was hee leaues him and cryes to the aultar to heare him all this is to shewe that these vnreasonable and vnsensible creatures if they had that reason that man hath would bee more obedient and carefull then man is of his dutie therfore to checke mans rebellion the prophets called vpon these things when man would not beare them and this is the cause why christ sends man here to the lillies of the field the second reason of this is because we doo not learne the good things which the creature can teach vs though we haue them see them and vse them dayly yet wee do not learne all that of god which nature teacheth wherefore for good cause wee are sent to them to learne that which may be learned of the wisedome power prouidence mercie iustice and goodnes of god is manifested in them amp yet we marke it not for this cause christ knowing our want and behauiour saith thus learne of the lillies ampc this serues to checke vs who do not learne so many good things of god as these creatures can teach how then shall we learne the doctrine of saluation so much for this point that christ saith learne of the lillies and by learning consider now what is the thing to be learned of the lillies how they growe this is the point to bee learned and considered they growe though they labour not nor spinne and salomon himselfe was not cloathed like one of these and it is a thing worth the marking for in the winter they are buried in the earth amp appeare no more then if they should neuer be seene and yet in the spring time of the yeare they growe vp with stalkes leaues flowers and goodly colours now the point to be marked is this how all this comes to passe they themselues do nothing neither doth man any thing to make them growe what is it then that makes them growe the cause is the word of creation which was giuen out by the creator in the beginning to the hearbes let the earth bring forth hearbe and tree by vertue of that commandement then deliuered to the earth the earth now though it be frozen in the winter couered with snowe and hardned with frost as though there should neuer be any hope for the lilly or other hearbes to growe yet it brings forth all in the spring and that with beautiful colours and all by vertue of god commandement in the same manner to come to the point god hath giuen a worde of prouidence ouer his servant that if they trust in him he will prouide them necessaries all necessaries whatsoeuer so as there shall be nothing wanting that is necessarie if they trust in him this worde is certaine set downe and as vnchangeable as the word of creation if man beleeue it they shall haue meate drinke and cloth as certainely as the flowers and hearbes and grasse come out of the earth this is the point here offered to our consideration they growe by the vertue of god word in the creation amp so they should doo to the ende of the world so in the matter of prouidence trust in god and walke in the compasse of thy calling and doubt not the issue if there were no more reasons to perswade vs to a moderate care for necessaries this one sensible reason borrowed from the lillies were sufficient when he saith they labour not ampc his meaning is not by their example to maintaine idlenesse or to neglect our calling but to teach vs that when all helpes faile vs walking in our calling and hauing done what wee can without our default god blessing shal not be wanting wee shal haue meats drinke and cloth though all means faile vs and for this end these words are set downe herein one speciall amplification is to be marked they are cloathed by god and that more gloriously then salomon himselfe was yet salomon had promises of great honour and glory without his seeking for hee desired but wisedome yet with wisedome god promised him honour for all this christ saith of the lillies that salomo was not cloathed like them and he speakes not of some one but of euery one and of the lillies of the field too not of the garden and euery one of them is cloathed more gloriously the salomon was when hee was in his chiefest glory first this serues to check and controll vs for our pride in apparell and to teach vs that wee ought not to bee so curious in attiring our selues for when wee haue done all we can wee cannot match one of these flowers but they will goe beyond vs why then should we puffe vp our selues in regard of our apparel whe as the least hearbe in the field is more gay what cloth in whitenes comes neare the lilly what purple like the violet and what crimson or scarlet is like diverse other flowers article may doo much but it cannot match nature doo what wee can the hearbes will goe beyond vs and if it be so why are we so proud of our apparel the hearbe which thou treadest vnder thy feete and puttest into the furnace is finer then thou article the second vse is to teach vs that all our pompe is but vaine for what is more fraile then the hearbe which is to day in the field and to morrow is cut downe so the whole nature of man is fraile and brittle as paul saith all the glory and pompe of this worlde is vaine and passeth away subiect to chaunge and alteration and yet when christ speaks this of salomons glorie and makes it inferior to the hearbe preferring this before that hee codemnes not salomons glory for it was promised him amp giue him by god and the word though it condemne curiositie and superfluitie of apparell yet it condemnes not gorgeous apparell in princes and great personages the pompe in apparell is not simply condemned in the word for ioseph refused not the ring and fine garment and whereas luke saith of agrippa and bernice that they came with much pompe the words may be taken as well in good part as ill in these words christ abaseth the creatures in regard of man amp the difference between man and the hearbes is in these things first they serue for mans vse therefore they are inferiour to him they serue for the making of his fire and the heating of his furnace secondly the hearbe is to day and hath a being to morrow it hath no being but ceaseth to be an hearbe so fraile and vaine is the creature that excelles man in glory but man hath a being to day and his being continueth the trees and hearbes haue a kinde of life and soule as man haue but there is a great difference for their soules are mortall and arise from the matter whereof the plant is made but the soule of man is immortall bee it of the righteous or the vnrighteous the difference is plaine in genesis where god commands the earth to bring forth hearbs and trees with life and substance but when hee made man the earth brought not foorth his soule but god breathed into him a liuing soule as for the soules of beast amp plants whether they be quallities or substances it is not knowne but they perish amp are corruptible and they cease to be that they were but it is not so with man for whe he dies he ceaseth not to be a man a dead man is a man still though not a liuing man and his soule shall be reunited to his body yes the body that is dead and lyeth in the graue is vnited to christ as well as the soule and by vertue thereof it shall rise againe i speake now of the righteous especially and therefore dead abraham is abraham still now it is not so with the other creatures the hearbe or tree being burnt ceaseth to bee an hearbe or tree but man when he dies because he is in the couenant he is still a man for he that is once in the couenant is in it for euer and the vertue of the couenant shall be as effectuall to raise the servant of god to glory as the word of creation is effectuall to bring the creature out of the earth therfore the diuersitie amp difference is to aduaunce man aboue the creature these wordes were spoken to all the disciples and other hearers wherein for our further edification these two circumstances are to be considered first the persons rebuked secondly the causes why they are rebuked the persos are the disciples when christ speakes thus to his disciples yee of litle faith he dooth not rebuke them simply for want of faith but because their wicked vnbeliefe was more and the distrust of god mercie and prouidence greater then their faith and beliefe so that not the want of faith but the smallnesse of it is here rebuked heere obserue that besides the full perswasion which is the highest degree of faith there is a lower degree and a less measure which is here called the less faith and this litle faith is not here condemned but the vnbeliefe that goes with it for this little faith in them was a true faith and christ confessed before that god was their father and it is a true faith that brings a man to the little adoption it brought them into that state that they had god for their father and they were his children cosidering that in the disciples amp others that their vnbeliefe was more than their faith their faith cannot saue them the sinne beeing greater then their grace faith doth not saue any because it is perfect but because it resteth on god mercie and though a mans vnbeliefe be greater then his faith yet it will not condemne him if hee do bewaile it and vse meanes diligently that it may encrease this first point of doctrine is to be remembred because euery childe of god cannot attaine to abrahams faith and to a full perswasion and therfore all such as haue but the beginning of faith must not be discouraged for thou maist be the childe of god with thy little faith if thou bewaile it and be diligent to attain to strog faith endlesse amp vnspeakable is the mercy of god in this behalfe he pardoneth manifolde doubtings distrust and vnbeleefe to them that bewaile it and desire to increase in faith secodly the cause why christ reproues his own disciples thus sharply is because they did not beleeue in god for raiment as if he had said because you beleeue not this therefore you are to be blamed as hauing litle faith and therefore he calles them thus because they did not belieue in god for meat drink and cloth here a second point of doctrine is to be obserued that true sauing faith doth not only apprehend god mercy for life eternall but for the temporall blessings of this life the very same faith whereby remission of sinnes and life eternal is apprehended layes holde on temporall blessings this must not seeme strange for to make it plaine there be two kinds of blessings promised in the scriptures viz principall and lesse principall the principall is christ god and man the redeemer of mankind with righteousnesse and life eternall in him this is the maine amp principall blessing now vpon this there followe blessings lesse principall which are also promised as well as the principall and these are meate drinke cloathing health ampc and these are promised vs so farre forth as they are for our good in christ and by christ all these are promised to this purpose paul saith all the premises in him are yes and amen not onely remission of sinnes is yes and amen that is a thing graunted and accomplished but all other temporall blessings this being so now marke what followes when true faith layes holde on the maine and principall blessing then withall it apprehends all other temporall blessings necessarie they are all apprehended in and with the principall it is said of abraham that by his very iustifying faith he did beleeue that god would giue him a son when hee was an hundreth yeares olde it was not a diverse faith noah by the same faith wherby hee was saued beleeued that he should be preserued and his houshold in the floud in like manner by one and the same faith we beleeue our reconciliation with god in christ amp remission of sinnes and that god will giue vs necessaries meate drinke cloth one and the same faith layes holde first on the maine and principall promise and then on the lesse principal this point must bee marked and this point remembred first mercie then prouidence first the principal blessing and then the temporall euery man saith he lookes to be saued by faith when he dies and it is well but we must adde this we must liue by faith too we must leade our liues by the same faith by which wee looke to be saued after this life and we must depend on god prouidece as certainly for these necessaries as we doo vpon his mercy for our saluation we must not liue by sence or reason but by faith how this is to be done you shal see afterward it is impossible for vs to be saued by faith when we die if we do not liue by faith hee that cannot cast himself vpon god prouidence for the necessaries of this life can much lesse cast himselfe on god mercy for the saluation of his soule so much for the second point thirdly christ giues vs here a note and marke whereby we may trie our faith whether it bee a sauing faith or no true or faigned great or litle for he giues vs to vnderstand that the more man are distracted with worldly cares the lesse is their faith and the reason is plaine the more mens care is the lesse their trust is in god prouidence and the lesse their trust is in god prouidence the lesse faith in his mercie for their saluation so that where worldly care beares rule there is no faith in god prouidence as long as man bee in prosperitie they thinke they haue great faith but in pouertie and affliction their faith is tried for then commonly the hart is swallowed vp with griefe and feare he that cannot rest on god prouidence for the things of this life how shall hee rest on god mercie in the paines of death and thus much of the reproofe these words are a repetition of the commandement deliuered in the verse and heere the commaundement is the second time repeated once before it was repeated the causes of this repetition are diverse one i haue declared before and that was that hee might set an edge vppon the commaundement and make it take place in theyr hearts secondly that they might learne theyr duties how they ought to confirme their faith for as christ vrgeth it by a repetition so man must by meditating vpon it the oftner encrease their faith faith is wrought in the heart as the print of a seale in the waxe or as a vision or reuelation in the night where the man dooth nothing but faith is wrought by these meanes ordinarie viz the worde read heard preached or meditated further that these meanes may bee effectuall there must be a motion in vs wherby wee must striue against doubting distrust and vnbeliefe amp therefore wee are often to vrge the commaundement to our selues and exercise our selues in it and apply it striue amp struggle wrestle amp labour for this ende that wee may more constantly and heartily apply the promises of mercie and prouidence to our selues this is the second cause of the repetition that wee may maister our vnbeliefe by striuing and labouring you must do that which you can do by nature and grace that is come to the assemblies and endeuour to put away vnbeliefe and by this meanes you shall encrease in faith so much for the repetition of the commaundement now to the words therefore take no thought ampc these words tend to this ende not to breed idlenesse or carelesnesse in any but as i declared in the verse therfore i will shewe you how far forth wee may care for the things of this life and where it must end first it goeth thus farre euerie man must haue a care to doo the good and profitable duties of his calling with diligence and painfulnesse from that care christ frees no man therfore euery man must consider what bee the duties of his calling and the most necessarie workes and these he must haue a care to performe secondly a man may haue care to prouide for himself and his such things as be necessarie that is meate drinke amp cloth for these a man may nay hee must haue a care so much as is necessarie in the iudgement of any this care is not condemned after this he must giue place to god prouidence and god must haue his worke the blessing and successe of all his labour must be left to god and then in the necke of these two cares comes faith that god will giue a necessarie blessing where care endes there faith begins wee must not care for the blessings and successe of our labours but referre that to the prouidence of god if god giue more then is necessarie wee must bee the more thankefull but if hee withholde his blessings wee must not liue by care but by faith thus farre wee may care and no further and this hath bene the practise of all god servant the distrustfull care is that which is here forbidden when man take all care vpon themselues and vexe themselues so as they are fit for nothing no not for the seruice of god but onely to care and it is care that teares the heart and distracts it and makes a man vnmeete for any thing else but onely to care this is the thought which christ condemnes when we vexe grieue and consume our selues day and night with care for the worlde and this is the common sinne of our time this care dooth possesse and poyson the hearts of many and it appeares by experience for what care is that which breakes your sleepe and awakes you at all houres of the night and what care is that which commeth first into your hearts in the morning when you rise and when the whole day is at an ende consider with your selues what is the thing you haue most thought of or altogether whereon hath all your care bene looke backe and see if it hath not beene for the world al the day long from the morning till the euening the care for the worlde takes the first place and filles vp the whole day why this can neuer bee but a distrustfull care and yet this is the ordinarie and common care therefore christ speakes this to vs all you may care for necessaries but liue by faith amp be content with god good will and pleasure let this commaundement take place in your hearts and let care be ioyned with faith and so lead your liues saying what shal we eate ampc now christ dooth describe this care by the fruites and effects for these be the speeches of them that bee possest with worldly care especially of them that haue great charges and meane liuing or which suffer great losses then man make such questions but how shall we maintaine our selues how shall we liue and thus you see how christ condemnes not all care but that which is ioyned with distrust when man complaine and murmure as if there were no god nor prouidence these speeches are condemned as proceeding from distrust and vnbeliefe and good reason for they are complaint of god dealing towords vs we ought to shut our mouthes in this respect and take heede how we murmur against god when aaron had both his sonnes burnt he comes to moses and would needes knowe the cause and when he heard it was god doing hee held his peace the place is worth the marking likewise dauid saith i held my tongue and said nothing for it was thy doing lord our cofidence is in peace and strength that is a man hath confidence in god when he complaine h not therefore this is our dutie neuer to complaine of god prouidence be the iudgement neuer so grieuous that befalles vs we must learne of the servant of god to holde our tongues and with peace and quietnesse to submit our selues to god when we are distressed and afflicted when we loose our liuing or friends for these are sinfull speeches speeches that bewray distrust vnbeliefe discontent and impatiencie here is a fift reason for after all these ampc therefore take no thought these words are a new reason to moue vs to flee all such care the practise of the gentiles must be shunned but this is a practise of the gentiles therefore it must be shunned the words haue a further sense the the translatio importeth for it is thus they seeke with al their might they set themselues or giue themselues to seeke them for the seeking of these necessaries is not a fault but y e giuing of our selues to seeke them with all our power then wee sinne whe we do so for they set their hearts to seeke them all their care is for them so much the words import you are a peculiar people of god and therefore you must not conforme your selues vnto the gentiles what is the cause the gentiles do so all the nation of the world before christ besides the iewes knew not god onely heere and there some one man that was a prophet excepted all the rest knew not god no prouidence nor any other life but this now if the gentiles did thus because they knew not god it followeth that vniuersall grace is but a phansie and a meere deuice of mans braine for the gentiles before christs incarnation knew not the true god but were without god how then could they haue grace which is a gift to be able to beleeue if they would if they failed in the knowledge of life eternall and god prouidece how was it possible y t they should haue this gift indeed in diverse country that were neare the iewes some liued as the iewes did and got some knowledge of god but the country that were farre off had no knowledge of god therefore there was no common grace giuen them all secondly christ shewes here that they which set themselues to seeke riches and worldly blessings they are as gentiles and haue not learned the principles of religion though they come to church heare the word and receiue the sacraments yet they are but as paynims they make themselues their owne god and they see no prouidence they are christians in shewe but gentiles in deed euen as the turkes are for they haue not learned the foundatios of religion by faith to rest on god prouidece this reason alone might moue vs to a moderate care for the temporall things now marke the ground of this reaso the church of god is a peculiar people therefore they must not be like the gentiles in euill things and in good things they must be better then they then marke and consider what a shame it is for the people of our time for the very maine sinnes of the gentiles are risen amongst vs as drunkennesse oppression vsurie slaundering ingrossing of the necessarie commodity of this life and these sinnes be as common amongst vs as they are amongst the infidel it is a shame for vs that are seperated from them in profession and beare the name of christians to liue in the same sinnes nay in regarde of oppression and crueltie there was neuer more founde among the heathen the poorer sort dye for want of reliefe hard hearted man get their liuing by god iudgements and fill theyr purses then and take the vantage of his iudgements when hee sends them for our sinnes though christe himselfe say in the person of the poore i am hungry and colde ampc yet fewe or none haue the bowels of compassio to feed amp cloathe him in his members well remember wee are a chosen people and therefore must not bee like the gentiles you haue a father in heauen and he knowes your need this is an answere to an obiection for some might say what may we not care for things needful these are things needefull christ answeres no though they be necessary yet you must haue no distrustfull care your heauenly father knoweth best what and how much of these temporall blessings are needful for you a most excellent reason and alone sufficient if this be so we ought to content our selues in euery state of life and vse a moderate care yes wee ought to bee as well content with sicknesse when god sends it as with health and giue thanks alike for both wee haue a father in heauen when hee sends sicknesse hee knowes it is better for vs then health so when wee are in pouertie wee ought as well to be content as with health for our father knoweth this to bee more for our good then plentie and aboundance this ought also to make vs content euen when we lie a dying and yeelding vp the ghost for our father seeth it to be for our good when wee dye that we should liue no longer so in any iudgement of god whatsoeuer it be this ought to content vs that we haue a father and hee knowes what is good for vs therefore be it whatsoeuer it will be that god sends it is good in the wisedome of our father though not in our carnall reason wherefore remember this for it will serue to pacifie vs for what is the cause we are so impatient in aduersitie and sicknesse but because wee doo not remember this therefore holde this by faith that wee haue a father in heauen amp he knoweth in his wisedome what is good for vs better then we our selues and in this faith and perswasion let vs liue and die and learne to bee content in euery estate hitherto hath bene shewed what care is to bee eschewed now followeth the care to bee vsed and this verse hath two parts viz a commaundement or an exhortation and a promise i will speake first of the meaning and then of the instructions the commandement is two folde first seeke the kingdome of god secondly his righteousnes viz the righteousnes of god to seeke the kingdome of god is nothing else but to haue a care to get it to labour and endeuour to obtaine it seeke this first this is aboue all things whatsoeuer haue a care of this vvhat is meant heere by the kingdome of god it signifieth a state and conditio of certain man which are in the fauour of god in christ and haue right to life eternall by christ this very state is called in the scriptures the kingdome of god and of heauen and this kingdome is onely one there be not two distinct kingdomes of god but onely one perfect and compleat kingdome yet it hath diverse degrees viz first of grace secondly of glorie the kingdome of grace is that in which a man is ruled by god word and spirit and that is the first step and entrance into the kingdome of glory the kingdome of glory is to haue fellowship with the trinitie after this life now both these degrees are here vnderstood by the kingdome of god it is further added and his righteousnesse the second thing that is to bee sought for aboue all and before all other things whatsoeuer is the righteousnesse of god whereby he makes vs righteous some haue read it thus and the righteousnesse thereof but the wordes will not beare the translation it must bee as it is and no otherwise viz the righteousnesse of god and this is added for a waightie cause for god kingdome stands in righteousnesse god then raignes in the hart of man and sets vp his kingdome there when hee enables them to serue god in righteousnesse amp then man are god subiects and therefore these words are an excellent exposition of the former when god iustifieth a sinner by the obedience of christ and enables him to obey god commaundements this righteousnesse paul speaketh of rom corinthian hee that knew no sin was made sin for vs that we might be made the righteousnes of god amp corinthian in all these and other places the righteousnes of god is nothing else but the obedience of christ god and man which hee performed in our behalfe in his sufferings and fulfilling the lawe this is the righteousnesse of god and is so termed in the scriptures and is indeede the ground worke and substance of the kingdome now it is so called for diverse causes first because it is giuen of god freely and man cannot get it neither by nature nor grace there is a ciuill righteousnes which man haue by nature and a religiousnesse before man which is of grace but this is neither of them it is out of the reach of nature and grace and therfore it is called god righteousnesse as a gift freely giuen of god secondly because at the day of iudgement god will approue of it and accept it as a perfect satisfaction of his lawe and nothing else is aunswerable to the rigour of the lawe and therefore it is also thus called because it is a righteousnesse which may be opposed to the iustice of god in the last iudgement thirdly the obedience of christ is called god righteousnesse because hee is such a person as is both god amp man the son of the father is god as the father and though this obedience were performed in the manhood yet it was performed by a person that was both god and man and in respect of that person it is so called adams righteousnesse was in himselfe and hee lost it therefore now our righteousnesse is in christe who is god and therefore it is called god righteousnesse corinthian now how is this obedience made ours or how shall wee come by it by imputation for god is content to accept it for vs and here we must further vnderstand sanctification to bee ioyned with it for it must not bee seperated from the fruites thereof these goe together iustification sanctification and regeneration at the same time that wee are iustified the heart is renued chaunged and sanctified whereby we are enabled to serue god in righteousnesse and holinesse the sense then is this let all your care bee to get this kingdome to serue god in holinesse and righteousnesse all the dayes of your liues this is the meaning of these words now follow the instructions hence it is to bee gathered plainely that wee are all out of god kingdome by nature and wee are in the diuels kingdome for what neede wee to seeke it if we were not out of it by nature corinthian sathan is called the god of this worlde that is of the greatest part of mankinde and hee is called the prince of this world ioh now hee is so termed because man by nature are his slaues and haue their hearts tied and chained so as they can doo nothing but his will see ephesian children of wrath and the diuell workes in the children of disobedience the reason is plaine when man cannot be content but refuse to bee vnder god and in his kingdome hee leaues them to the diuell that he may raigne and rule in their hearts and the truth of this we shewe in the course of our liues though man weare the liuerie of christ yet in heart they doo homage to the diuell wee heare the word and receiue the sacraments but when it comes to obedience of the commaundements when wee are to put our neckes vnder christs yoake wee make light account of it and the very performance of morall duties is counted and called nicenesse precisenesse and curiousnesse what is this in effect but as if man should say to christ depart from vs wee will not haue this man to raigne ouer vs it is a grieuous and a fearefull sinne and such as argues that although we professe our selues to bee christs servant yet are we sathans vassalles if a man labour to drawe them from their unlawful pleasures and profit they will not spare to speake it with open mouth depart from vs wee will none of thy wayes as the wicked man is brought in speaking in iob therefore it is not without iust cause that christ makes this exhortation heere saying first seeke secondly we are taught here an excellent point neuer to be forgotten for it is the principall point and it is this our principall care must bee to win the kingdome of heauen that is the poynt which christe shootes at i neede not stand to proue it for this one commandement declares it the words are plaine therefore i beg you embrace this commaundement and obey it and let this be our principall care now and euer till death you will say how shall we do this how shall wee learne to practise it that you may do it three things must bee remembred first you must come to the place where this kingdome is to bee found secondly when you are come thither you must enter into it thirdly you must waite for the possession of it touching the first when man cannot finde the kingdome of god in all places there be set and certaine places in which it is to be found god hath appointed publike assemblies and a publike ministrie in which the doctrine of reconciliation and saluation is deliuered and these bee the places where this kingdome is to bee found and these be the meanes whereby it is attained in the gospell the kingdome of heauen is thus taken often especially math the very ministrie of the word and the dispensation of the doctrine of saluation is called the kingdome of god because it is the onely means by which god dooth giue this kingdome and offer it in the canticles the church asketh christ where his kingdome is and he answeres by the shepheards tents therefore wee must come to heare the word and labour to profit by it because it is the sole and solemne meanes by which god giues his kingdome and you must take heede how you neglect this dutie because you know not whe the lord wil open your hearts amp not only offer but giue you this kingdme the second dutie is to enter into it for it is not inough to come where god kingdome is amp to haue the kingdome of god amongst vs as the pharisies had when christ preached but we must goe one step further and enter into it for till we enter wee shall neuer haue benefite by it how shall we enter math except yee be changed and become as litle babes yee cannot enter that a man may enter he must become like a litle childe now y e maner of a childe is this the child of a prince without any disdaine or affectatio of superioritie wil play with a poore mans childe that is the propertie of children and so must we become children begin to be displeased with our selues lay aside all selfe loue and selfe liking we are neuer capable of the kingdome of god till we cast down our selues and see that we are traitors and rebels against god we cannot come to god kingdome before and to this purpose christ saith to nicodemus except a man be borne a new of water and of the spirit he cannot see the kingdome of god this regeneration is when wee are chaunged not in the substance of bodie or soule but whe the diuels image is defaced and wee are sanctified in our minds and thoughts willes and affections and in all our actions now then that we may enter into god kingdome wee must be humbled like litle children and when a man begins to be regenerated and conuerted then hee begins to enter into the kingdome of god and not when hee dies as many thinke now a man must alwayes after shewe himselfe to bee entred by holinesse and righteousnesse and by duties of loue and mercie and that is the reason of this addition and his righteousnesse and by that wee declare our selues to be of god kingdome and to belong vnto it for that stands in righteousnesse the question beeing who shall dwell in god kingdome the answere is he that worketh righteousnesse psalm the third thing to bee done for the obtaining of god kingdome is to wayt for the possession and that is neuer giuen till the day of death and this waiting is performed when a man conuerted amp regenerated hath a care to keepe faith and a good conscience till death he that doth thus waytes for the kingdome of god as ioseph of arimathea is sayd to haue done luke now then we see how the kingdome of god is to bee sought for it is by doing these three thinges first by comming into the place where this kingdome is to be found secondly by entering into it and thirdly by waiting for the possession of it these are to bee distinguished one from an other now let me renew my exhortation let your principall care be to performe these duties amp to practise these three thinges so long as you liue for in the kingdome of god standes all your happinesse ioy peace felicitie and blessinges out of it is nothing but griefe woe and horrour vnspeakeable all ioy and comfort whatsoeuer can bee wished or thought of is in the kingdome of grace and glory therefore if you desire happinesse let your care bee for these thinges for out of this kingdome there is nothing but misery and the wrath of god hangs ouer euery one that is not in it euery houre hee is in daunger of god heauy iudgements oh fearefull state oh wretched people that feare it not wherefore to conclude that we may escape the plagues and punishments of the damned and haue the comforts of the subiects of this kingdome let this be the maine and principall care to be of this kingdome and to liue in it for if you liue out it still eternall woe will befall you let this heauenly doctrine take place in all your harts and do not flat and soothe your selues perswading your selues that if you leade a ciuil life and come to church all is well and you are safe for marke the kingdome of god is like a citie and it hath his suburbes and sundrie gates the first gate is the ministrie of the word when you are come so farre then you are in the suburbes but yet you are not in the citie all sorts of man come thus farre both good and bad but there is a second gate and that is when a man is regenerated and conuerted then he first sets his foote within the citie all before is but the suburbes and may bee performed of hypocrites onely the children of god passe this gate therefore content not your selues to heare the word and receiue the sacraments and to be counted christians for all this is nothing more then the hypocrites may do but labour to become new creatures that you may bee free denisons in the kingdome of heauen and then indeed we seeke the kingdome of god aright when we striue to enter in at this gate thus much of the dutie commaunded which i will repeate because it is a matter of weight first seeke the kingdome of god and his righteousnesse this must be the principall care of all persons whatsoeuer young or old high or lowe to come within this kingdome here is then a iust rebuke for worldlings who do the contrary and set the cart before the horse now a little of the promise which is a most worthy and heauenly promise and all these things shall be ministred vnto you the greeke word is very significant amp the translation hath not expressed all the sense it is borrowed from bargayners but especially from sellers of wares whe man haue made a bargaine especially of any great quantitie commonly the seller will giue some ouerplus and additament for amendes for the further contentment of the buyer so let vs seeke the kingdome of god and all temporall blessings shall be added as an ouerplus and amends to the full contentment of all our hearts besides the word signifieth that they shall be cast or flung or added as an ouerplus and an increase besides the kingdome here you see a most heauenly promise which is to be considered of with all reuerence quest how can this be true seeing we read of many worthy servant of god which haue bene starued amp pined and destitute of garments whereof diverse exaples might be brought but one or two shall serue paul saith it of himselfe corinthian and the holy ghost hebr of all christians all the promises of temporall blessings must bee vnderstood with this exception vnlesse it please god to proue vs and trie our faith and patience and exercise and chastise vs by want thus much concerning the exposition and meaning now followe the instructions this shewes vs the right way to get wealth and all temporall blessings whatsoeuer therefore marke it for christ the fountaine of wisedome hath taught it the right way commended by christ is aboue all things to seeke the kingdome of god to seeke to be gouerned by god spirit and to serue him in holinesse and righteousnesse this is the right way and none other therefore let euery one marke it and the reason is plaine the kingdome of god is the principall good of man meate drinke and cloth and such like are but dependances which appertaine vnto it this is the principall therefore he that would obtaine these and haue good successe with them should first seeke god kingdome for these are entailed together when the arke was in the house of obed edom his house prospered all the while if the presence of the arke brought such a blessing much more god kingdome yes as dauid saith whatsoeuer he doth it shall prosper psalm to come neare our selues wee haue had great peace a long time and the maine and principall blessing of all is this that the kingdome of god is amongst vs and this hath brought with it peace and protection and because it hath not had so good successe amongst vs as it ought therefore god hand is amongst vs and wil be more if wee continue to reiect the obedience of his commaundements this being so marke this lesson article thou a poore man and wouldest thou haue sufficient wealth to liue to thy comfort and contentment set thy heart vpon this kingdome first and labour for repentance and regeneration and thou shalt finde god blessing how comes it to passe then that we haue so many beggers they are a cursed generatio which liue out of all order neither obeying god lawe nor mans and therefore god curse is vpon them to death article thou a rich man and wouldest thou continue so and maintaine thy estate then let thy peincipall care bee to seeke the kingdome of god and to bring thy family to it nay to set it vp in thine house article thou a student amp wouldest thou haue the blessing of god vpon thy labour let thy first care be to seeke god kingdome labour to enter into it in this life and the lord will prouide for thee the like may bee said to all merchant trade man and handicrafts artificibus amp opificibus who liue by buying and selling or working in a word whatsoeuer you bee man or woman high or lowe old or young make conscience of this hast thou children and wouldest thou make them portions and maintaine them to thine owne and their comforts labour for this and this is the best dowrie and inheritance that thou canst giue them therefore seeing this is so i must renue mine exhortation let not the diuell steale away this doctrine nor your owne corruption banish it let maisters ministers and magistrates euery one in his place labour to set vp the kingdome of god lastly let all persons whether publike or priuate labour for this while they liue euery man talkes of the kingdome of god when he dies but wee must enter while we liue or neuer to this adde the particular beliefe of such promises the want whereof is the cause that we faile in the duties commanded now there are other instructions to be learned here when christ saith all these things shall be ministred vnto you to wit all these things meate drinke and cloth and all temporal blessings necessary whatsoeuer he giues vs to vnderstand that all these things all temporall blessings are certaine dependances things that depend vpon the kingdome of god this is the second point to bee remembred that all these are annexed to that this appeares thus when man seeke the kingdome of grace and the kingdome of glory god will giue them these and more too besides the kingdome which is the onely thing which hee must ayme at hee dooth cast vnto them sufficient blessings for the preseruation of this temporall life so that all temporall blessings appertaine to the kingdome of god they depend vpon it amp are annexed vnto it and herevpon sundrie other instructions may be gathered if this be so that all temporall blessings depend on god kingdome the we for the most part liue after a most preposterous order and maner for wee care more for the body then we do for the soule for this life more then for the life to come more for meate and drinke then for the kingdome of heauen generally the care of most man is all for the world and there is little or no care for the life to come wee may see our folly in the folly of children they are better pleased with a nutte or an apple then with a promise of great reuenues or of a great inheritance and wee haue more regard of temporall blessings then wee haue of the kingdome of god and yet these are but dependances to that secondly wee are taught to seeke for riches and temporall blessings with the same minde with which wee seeke the kingdome of god that is with an honest heart for they depend one vpon an other wee must seeke this kingdome of god with an vpright heart and so wee must seeke riches with a good heart and honest dealing vsing no vniust meanes and as wee are to seeke them thus so wee must vse them when wee haue them for this ende to further god kingdome with the same for riches are things that depend vpon that amp therefore ought to serue to this ende thirdly if this bee so that riches are dependances on god kingdome then hee that hath no right to the kingdome of god and is not in it hath no right to any temporall blessings for they are annexed one to an other turkes and infidel haue temporall blessings from god and enioy them an they haue them but by permission from god they haue no right nor tytle to them indeed and in conscience i graunt in ciuil courts and in a ciuil respect they haue a right vnto them and a proprietie in them but in conscience amp before god they haue none at all as many as are out of god kingdome whatsoeuer they be they haue no right to any temporal blessings nor to any creature but are very theeues and meere vsurpers before god thogh they haue right to them before me let this be remembred that they haue no right to the meate that they eate to the cloathes they put on nor to the ground they goe on this shewes what vile and miserable wretches we are so long as wee are out of god kingdome wee haue no right so much as to the very breath which wee drawe in at our nosthrils nor to the bread wee put into our mouthes ampc but all the creatures are against vs and this is without question the state of all and euery man that is out of god kingdome by which we see what miserable wretches we are much lesse haue wee any spirituall blessings wherwith to comfort our selues further if this bee a truth this must bee an inducement to euery one to remember the lesson taught before namely aboue all things to seeke to get the kingdome of god for till then wee are most miserable wee haue no comfort in any creature or blessing of god nay the creatures that bee in our hands we haue no right vnto them wee haue not so much right as the beastes haue if there were no more reasons but this one taken from our miserable state so long as we are out of the kingdome of god this one ought to bee a spur vnto vs to make vs seeke it nay we ought to be at no rest till wee bee perswaded out of god word that wee be in that kingdome we should giue our soules no rest day no night til we be resolued of this that wee are within the kingdome of grace now whilest wee are liuing vpon earth and therfore i adde this because we are thus miserable as you see till we be in it and that you may the better knowe when you bee in it remember but thus much when you be regenerate then you enter but you will say how shall we know when we are regenerate when you beginne to bee touched in coscience with your sinnes and to be displeased with your selues for the sins of your nature and the sinnes of your liues and withall begin to hunger after christs righteousnes and to frame your liues according to god commandemets then you are regenerate and then you enter into the kingdome of god you obtaine it and haue right vnto it therefore if you would haue an entrance into it labour to be touched amp greeued for your sinnes in heart and conscience labour to feele your neede of christ and of his blood and haue a care to put your neckes vnder his yoke and whe these things are in you whatsoeuer you haue bene before though the vilest sinners that euer were you enter into the kingdome of god againe if this be so that temporall thinges are but dependances we are taught that when any calamitie or losse befalls vs whether it be of goods friends or good name we oght then to stay our selues and not to suffer our selues to be ouerwhelmed with immoderate sorow and griefe for when the greatest losses come that can be of worldly things what is it but of thinges that depend on the kingdome of god the kingdome it selfe is not lost what though thou loose the fauour and countenance of man and thy reputation and estimation among them or some part of thy goods this causeth not the losse of the kingdome the right and title of that may stand good notwithstanding al these therefore wee must moderate our griefe with this consideratio and thus christ comforted his disciples in their afflictions feare not litle flock for it is your fathers pleasure to giue you a kingdome the third point of doctrine to bee gathered hence is this that god is a bountifull god and his bountifulnesse is heere described for if you seeke the kingdome of god you shall haue it amp much more see here the exceeding great bountifulnesse of god that giues man more then they seeke aske or thinke of when man seeke this kingdome they shall haue it amp much more euen al things necessarie for this life a notable token of god great bountie the same goodnesse is excellently set forth else where paul praiseth god and attributes this vnto him as the cause of his thankes giuing because he can do more then we either aske or thinke ob he can do what is that to the purpose ans therefore he speakes of such a power as is brought forth into action and hee will doo this is the goodnesse of god hee giues them that which they seeke and more then they seeke he can do it and hee will doo it it is a point worth the consideration that god giues his seruaunts more then they seeke for or thinke of when they pray see the performance of it to dauid thou preuentest him with liberall blessings signifying that god gaue him more then hee prayed for amp that which he neuer thought of this was also verified in salomon hee asked only wisedome and god gaue him that and riches and honor likewise as also in iacob amp ioseph thus we see the truth of this promise performed both by testimony and examples sutable to it and there is none of vs all but if we looke into our selues we shall finde that god hath giuen vs more then euer we desired or euer thought we shuld haue had this point is not to be let passe without remembrance the vse hereof is manifold for we are taught all maner of good duties by it first to haue a continuall care that we do nothing that may offend god for he is a liberall and a bountifull god when we pray he giues vs more then we aske secondly this should moue vs to put our trust in god for all necessaries trust him with our liues and soules and with all that we haue if hee be so bountifull as we see he is we ought not to distrust him for any thing belonging either to the soule or to the body thirdly this should moue vs in all distresse to seek to him for helpe and succour because he is ready to helpe fourthly it should moue vs to loue this god in consideration of this bountifulnesse fiftly to be willing to pray to him and to be ready to make our moane to him sixtly to be thankfull to him cotinually who is so bountifull to vs daily preuenting vs with bountifull blessings in a word to conclude this ought to be a spurre to pricke vs forward to euery good dutie and to turne our hearts from euery way that is euill and to please god in all things and so much of that pointe of the bountifulnesse of god in that hee giues them the kingdome of heauen which seeke it and withal a great deale more then they desire and so much of the vse here christ doth repeate the commaundement which hee gaue in the verse it was repeated twise before and now it is heere repeated the third time his often repeating of this commaundement is to teach vs to be carefull to learne it to remember it and to do it now for the wordes themselues care not ampc that is take no care for the time to come this may seeme a strange commaundement maintaining idlenesse and licentiousnesse therefore wee must consider what is the true sense and meaning thereof for the words are not so to be conceiued as at the first reading they seeme to be but there are two sorts of care yes of care for time to come first a lawful and a godly care secondly a distrustfull care that there is a godly care euen for the time to come it is plaine for christ himselfe had a bagge and iudas kept it therfore his meaning is not to forbid all care of time to come and when agabus foretold the famine the church prouided against it wherfore there is no question but there is a lawful care for the time to come whiche is not heere forbidden that you may know what care that is mark this those things that be necessarie as meate drinke and cloath and cannot be prouided hereafter may be prouided aforehand without sin and without breach of this commandement for example a man of trade that is decayed in his strength amp eye sight may haue some thing prouided to maintaine himselfe when his strength and sight is gone hee may prouide aforehand things necessarie for himselfe when he is olde and cannot worke to get his liuing it remaines therfore that there is a lawful care for to morrow and that is when to morrow is not able to helpe it selfe but when to morrow is able to helpe it selfe then it is not lawful to care for to morrow so the this point is cleare quest what care is it then that christ condemnes ans a distrustfull care for such a care the greeke word signifieth which doth distract the minde ampc as before that you may the better perceiue it see some examples of it when man prouide so much wealth as will keepe and maintaine both them and theirs for many ages if they can heape vp goods not to bee numbred they wil do it and there be many such gather goods man forecast to prouide so much as would maintaine them if they should liue as long as methushelah this is the care forbidden when man prouide so much for themselues as would suffice for many families the king himselfe who hath most neede of aboundance must not multiply too much his horse and money much lesse ought any subiect if any man had neede of superaboundance and superfluitie the king much more yet hee is forbidden it why then if it bee a thing to bee barred the prince if hee must bee stinted and limited what man dares bee so bolde as to exceed his bounds amp breake out beyond his borders this is one example of the distrustfull care an other example is when man prouide against all mischaunces and casualties so that they will auoyd all losses and damages whatsoeuer and howsoeuer the iudgement of god fall on others they will be free from all and though all the world should die before the for want yet they will liue and haue aboundance of meate drinke and cloth they will so prouide for all euents and daungers whatsoeuer a third example of this is when man doo now prouide things necessarie which may sufficiently bee prouided in time to come and this is the care that is here condemned by name when they care this day for to day and to morrow too when this day may care for it selfe and the morrow for it selfe thus you see the right meaning of this commaundement how christ forbids all extraordinary curious and superfluous care and so much for the commandement for the morrow shall care for it selfe now christe layeth downe a seuenth reason to perswade them and vs to a moderate care for meate and drinke both for the time present and the time to come the effect of the reason is this euery day that man liueth hath sufficient griefe of it owne and therefore we ought not to care for the time to come if it may be cared for hereafter for so wee should bring more care vpon vs then needes that is the substance of it now to the words christ answereth an obiection which is this how shall wee do then for the morrow amp for the time to come things that bee necessarie hereafter in time to come must be cared for hereafter if it bee possible that is christs answer euery day must care for it selfe the time present for it selfe and the time to come for it selfe in which words christ deliuers a notable rule for the framing of our liues to be remembred and thought vpon and it is this euerie man must knowe his owne calling and what be the duties of it and how they must liue in their callings they must doo the necessarie duties and the present duties of their callings that is the most necessarie and principall and those things that the dutie the time the day and the present occasion requires quest but what must wee do then for the time to come ans that must bee left vnto god by faith things present appertaine to vs when these things shall be saith samuel to saul that is thou being now a king shalt be confirmed in it doo that which comes to thine hand that is shewe thy selfe a king thou mayest not now plot for time to come but as occasion shall be offered take them and lay hold of them amp be not troubled with feare of things to come the present workes of thy calling looke what they be and practise them and so must we do the present duties of our calling as for feare and hope which are vncertain of things to come refer the to god we must not feede our selues with vncertaine hopes nor vexe our selues with vncertaine feares but we must do things present this is a most necessarie rule for the ordering and framing of our liues the day hath enough with his owne griefe that is euery day hath affliction trouble amp griefe inogh comes with it because of our sinnes liue we neuer so long in this world euerie day will haue griefe and griefe enough and therefore wee neede not nay wee may not adde more griefe here christ sets forth the miserie of mans life and that very notably iacob said his dayes were fewe and miserable iob saith mans life is short and full of trouble and christ goes beyond them both and saith euery day hath griefe enough whereby hee declares and sets forth notably the miserable state of this life which is full of griefe affliction and sorrow here we learne that we must walke in our callings so as wee intangle not our selues in worldly cares for euerie day hath griefe enough of it selfe though we adde none to it and the more we care the more miserable do we make our life secondly this being so wee are taught here further to labour to estrange our selues from this life and to be out of loue with it and to seeke for a better the prophet elijah vpon the very miseries of this life which befell him in particulars saith lord take away my soule i am not better then my fathers and paul saith i desire to be dissolued amp to be with christ and oh wretched man that i am who shall deliuer me from this body of earth he speakes not simply but in regard of the better estate and to be with christ out of this vale of teares therfore wee ought not to addict our selues too much to the world but to haue a loue and longing after the life to come the very consideration of this life amp the state thereof and of euery day in it should moue vs to this we ought euery day to commend our body amp soules and all that we haue to the protection and tuition of god for wh the day begins wee shall haue euill inough let vs do what we can to helpe our selues therefore we ought for the comforting amp quieting of our coscience to commend our selues to god as christ when hee was a dying we know not how soone we may die therfore euerie day ought to performe this dutie for that which christ did at his death dauid did in his life time for those wordes that christe spake were dauids words and he spake them not at his death but in his life vpon occasion of a vexation if we learne any good thing wee learne it not without paine and griefe trauell and trouble if we do any good thing wee are not free from trouble if we repent wee are molested with our corruptions if wee be the servant of god we haue daily crosses and temptations and so much for this seuenth reason and of this point in which christ forbids the practise of couetousnesse and strikes at the very roote of all namely distrustfull care for meat drinke and apparell

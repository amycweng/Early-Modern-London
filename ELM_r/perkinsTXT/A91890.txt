vnto the former principles published by that reverend man mr william perkins fully containing what every christian is to beleeve touching god and himselfe i have thought it fit for the good especially of those over whom i am set the younger sort of whom i have formerly catechised in private according to the same principles to annex a few other touching the more solemne fellowship of christians the church of god as being a divine institution the spirituall paradise and temple of the living god in which his most solemne services are to bee performed and to which he addeth daily such as shall be saved promising to dwell in the middest of them by his most powerfull and gracious presence question vvhat is a church ans a company of faithfull and holy people with their seed called by the word of god into publick covenant with christ and amongst themthemselves for mutuall fellowship in the use of all the meanes of god glory and their salvation qu of what sort or number of people must this company consist a it is all one whether they be high or low few or many so as they exceed not such a number as may ordinarily meet together in m matth one place for the worshipping of god and sanctification of the lord day qu what are the reasons why the church must consist of faithfull and holy persons a first the corinthian ampc act scriptures every where so teach the levit rom corinthian philipp to verse h eoh column church is the body of christ all whose members therefore should be conformable in some measure to him their head onely such john prov hob ampc worshippers please god as are accepted of him and have right to the covenant of grace and seales thereof qu but are not hypocrites mingled with the faithfull in the church a none ought to bee by the word of god and where such are they are not truly added by the lord to the church but doe iude v eze creepe in through their owne hypocrisie and not without the churches sin also if they may bee discerned to be such qu by what meanes is the church gathered a mat act ampc amp cap rom corinthian by the word preached and by faith received of them that heare it qu is every beleever a member of the visible church a act and no act amp cap amp amp act with thes but he must also by his personall and publick profession adjoyne himselfe to some particular fellowship and societie of saints qu how prove you the seed of the faithfull to be of the church with them a by the gen ampc luke gal covenant which god made with abraham and his seed which was the covenant of the gospell and confirmed in christ the rom seale thereof circumcision being the seale of the righteousnesse of faith qu what are the essentiall markes of the church a column pet with faith and order as the church in them may be scene and beheld to walke in christ iesus whom shee hath received faith professed in word and deed shewing the matter to bee true and order in the holy things of god shewing the forme to bee true which are the two essentiall parts of the church as true matter and forme or two essentiall parts of other things as of a house temple tabernacle exod to qu are not the preaching of the word and administring of the sacraments certain marks of the true church a no for the word may and that rightly be preached to assemblies of unbeleevers for their conversion mat mark act amp ampc as may the sacraments also though unjustly bee administred unto them gen sichemites kings ampc hos with psalm rom and so be made sying signes besides the true church may for a time want the use of diverse ordinances of god but hath alwayes right unto them as may also the false church usurpe and abuse them but without right qu what are the meanes in and by which christ and the church have fellowship together a corinthian in the gifts of the spirit of christ in the offices of ministery given to the church in the workes done in and by those gifts and offices qu wherein standeth this communion of the spirit a ephesians amp chap column in the in dwelling and operation of the gifts and graces thereof conveyed from christ as the head unto the church as his body and members one of another whence ariseth that most streit and divine conjunction by which as by the civill bond of marriage the man and wife are one flesh so they who are thus joyned to christ are one spirit corinthian ephesians to qu how many are the offices of ministery in the church a five besides the extraordinary offices of apostles prophets and evangelists for the first plant of the churches which are ceased with their extraordinary gifts qu how is that proved a partly by the rom ti with scriptures which both mention them expresly and describe them by their principall gifts and workes and partly by reason agreeable to the scriptures qu shew me which those officers bee with their answerable gifts and workes a ephesians or the exhorter rom or the exhorter corinthian rom tim the pastor to whom is given the gift of wisedome for exhortation the teacher to whom is given the gift of knowledge for doctrine the governing elder who is to rule with diligence the deacon who is to administer the holy treasure with simplicitie the widow or deaconesse who is to attend the sick and impotent with compassion and cheerefulnesse qu what is the reason for the proving of these ministeries a because all these are usefull and necessary and these alone sufficient for the church as being the most perfect societie and corinthian ephesians verse body of christ which neither faileth in that which is necessary nor exceedeth in any thing superfluous qu whence ariseth the usefulnesse and sufficiency of these ministeries in the church a from the condition partly of the soules and partly of the body of the members qu how doth that appeare a in the soule is the facultie of understanding about which the teacher is to be exercised for information by doctrine the will and affections upon which the or exhorter ibidem pastor is especially to work by exhortation and comfort because that doctrine and exhortation without obedience are unprofitable the diligence of the ruling elder is requisite for that purpose qu how are the other two ministeries to be exercised a as the church consisteth of man and they of soules and body so are the deacons out of the churches treasure and contribution to provide for the common uses of the church reliefe of the poore and maintenance of the officers as are the widowes to afford unto the sick and impotent in body not able otherwise to help themselves their cheerefull and comfortable service qu wherefore call you those offices by the name of ministeries or services a for two causes for that they are no lordships but services of christ and of the church because they consist in administring only of those things which are christs and the churches under him q by whom are these officers to have their outward calling a by the church whereof they are members for the present and to which they are to administer q how doth that appeare a the apostles who taught onely christs commandements so directed the churches act amp cap amp cap greek act amp tim the people amongst whom they have been conversant can best judge of their fitnesse both in respect of their persons and families it furthereth much the diligence and saithfulnesse of the minister that they whose minister hee is have freely chosen him as unto whom under christ they commit the most pretious treasure of their soule as also it binds the people to greater love and conscience of obedience of him and his ministry whom themselves have made choyce of the church being a most free corporation spirituall under christ the lord is in all reason and equity to chuse her ministers and co corinthian tim corinthian heb servant under him unto whom also shee is to give wages for their service and labour qu is this outward calling of simple necessity for a true church officer a yes as for the magistrate in the city and common wealth or steward in the family without which they usurp their places how excellent soever whether in their gifts or workes q what if the officer bee found unfaithfull in his place a he is by the church to bee warned to take heed to his ministery hee hath received to fulfill it which if he neglect to doe by the same power which set him up he is to be put downe and deposed being dealt with as a brother math q vvhat are the outward workes of the churches communion with christ a these six prayer the reading and opening of the vvord the sacraments singing of psalmes censures contribution to the necessity of the saints qu wherefore put you prayer in the first place a because by it all the rest are sanctified to the faithfull for prayer see the end of the fifth principle with the exposition onely adde this that in the act of our speaking unto god by prayer wee are not to use the helpe of any booke beades crucifixes or the like to teach or provoke us but onely the helpe of the spirit of adoption and prayer working in our hearts effectually and teaching us both what and how to pray as we ought qu what believe you touching the word a besides the things observed in the fifth principle and exposition that the whole written word and it alone is to be read and opened in the church qu wherefore are the whole scriptures to be read and opened a prov rom tim because the whole word of god is pure written for our learning and comfort given by divine inspiration and is profitable for doctrine reproofe correction and instruction and from which nothing may be deut reverand diminished qu how prove you that the scriptures only are to be read and opened in the church a s because they alone are sufficient for faith and the obedience which is of faith and able to make the man of god perfit throughly furnished unto all good workes and unto which nothing may prov deut reverand be added qu who are to open and apply the scriptures in the church a principally the bishops or act tit elders who by the word of life are to feed the flock both in teaching and government secondly such as are out of office in the exercise of prophesie qu how is that exercise proved in the scriptures a by luke amp cap act amp cap amp cap amp cap examples in the iewish church where man though in no office either in temple or synagogue had liberty publiquely to use their gifts luke amp cap g rom pet corinthian by the commandement of christ and his apostles by the prohibiting of tim corinthian pet woman not extraordinarily inspired to teach in the church herein liberty being given unto man their husbands or others by the excellent ends which by this meanes are to be obtained as thes tim corinthian the glory of god in the manifestation of his manifold graces that the gifts of the spirit in man be not quenched for the fitting and triall of man for the ministery for the preserving pure of the doctrine of the church which is more endangered if some one or two alone may onely be heard and speake for debating and satisfying of doubts if any doe arise for the edifying of the church and conversion of others qu vvho is a prophet in this sence a he that hath the gift of the spirit to speake unto edification exhortation and comfort qu vvhat is the order of this exercise a that it be performed af er the publique ministery by the teachers and under their direction and moderation whose duty it is if any thing be obscure to open it if doubtfull to cleare it if unsound to refuse it if unperfit to supply what is wanting as they are able qu what believe you touching the sacraments further then is observed in the former principles a that they are to be dispensed according to the tenure of the covenant of grace whereof they are seales in respect both of the persons to whom and of the ends for which they are to be administred qu vvhich are those persons a the faithfull and their seed qu may all the faithfull partake in the sacraments a act act rom deut no except they be also added to some particular congregation unto which the publique ordinances and ministery doth appertaine qu vvhich are the ends and uses of the sacraments a the first is from god to the church opened in the exposition of the fifth principle where it is shewed what a sacrament is the second is from the church to god in which it testifieth the acceptance of the covenant and bindeth it selfe to the performance of the conditions the third is in respect of the members themselves mutually as being badges of their association the fourth in respect of all other assemblies betweene whom and the churches they are notes of distinction qu vvhat is required touching singing of psalmes in he church a that they be such as are parts of the word of god formed by the holy ghost into psalmes or songs which many may conveniently sing together exhorting and admonishing themselves mutually with grace in their hearts qu vvhat believe you touching the censure of excommunication a that it is to be used by every particular church according to the rules of christ qu how prove you this power to be in every particular congregation a by the donation and gift of christ the lord the particular church of corinthian had this power for the neglect whereof it is reproved by the apostle every particular church hath right to the vvord sacraments and prayer within it selfe which are greater and therfore to this which is less then they qu vvhat are the rules of christ for excommunication a the sin thus to be censured must be scandalous and the person obstinate after due conviction and patience used the church excommunicating must bee that particular congregation gathered together in the name of christ whereof the sinner is a member qu how prove you that by the church math is not meant the bishop or presbytery representing the body a one man cannot be a church which as christ teacheth verse must be a company how small soever gathered together in his name the word there used never signifieth in the scriptures an officer or officers excluding the people the apostle corinthian expounds christs meaning to be of the whole body come together the elders being publique officers are to exercise the solemne workes of their office and particularly the worke of rebuking them that sinne openly and before the church both that others may feare and the church of faith consent to the excommunication and therefore cannot represent the church being actually present a representative church in a case of faith and conscience without the consent of the represented in the particular decree establisheth the popish doctrine of implicit faith qu what is the order of proceeding in this censure a that the brother offending privately be admon shed privately and after without his repentance with a witnesse or two who may give testimony both of the offence and admonition and lastly that by the brother admonishing with his witnesses the sinner remaining obstinate complaint be made to the church which last complaint alone is sufficient in publike offences qu vvhat order is to be observed after complaint thus made a the elders as the govenours of the church are by the scriptures clearely to convince and seriously to admonish and exhort the offender and upon his impenitency with due conviction and patience to decree against him the sentence of excommunication and lastly with the peoples free consent to pronounce and execute the same qu how appeareth the necessity of this ordinance a many wayes by the commandement of christ and practise of the apostolicall churches for the glory of christ which is much impeached by the prophanesse of those who profesle his service for the humbling of the sinner and for the salvation of his soule corinthian verse to prevent the infection of others heb that by the zeale and holinesse of the church they without may be gayned to the gospell qu how is the church to walke towards a person excommunicated a so as they may make him ashamed by withdrawing from him in all spirituall communion and ciuill familiarity also so farre as may be without the violation of any naturall or civill bond q what is to be observed for the churches contribution a that in their publique meeting every first day of the week they contribute as god hath prospered them to the publique treasury by the deacons to be received and distributed as there is need to the reliefe of the poore maintenance of the ministery and other necessary uses of the church first and after of others also as need requireth

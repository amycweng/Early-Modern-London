most gratious and dread souera gne albeit my slenddr skill cannot affoord any discourse worthie the view of your excellencie neither my deadded and daily interrupted and not but pers s that studie plo treason persecuted studies will giue me leaue to accomplish that little which otherwise i ght vndertake and performe yet being nbolde ed both by your high and gratious fauour euer shewed vnto all good litterature especially concerning diuinitie and also vrged by mine owne bounden dutie and particular affection i presume to present vnto your highnes this sho ing eatise for your exceeding clemencie es and rare modestie in the most e inent estate of to mightie a monarch as it cannot but winne vnto you great loue in the h arts of all considerate subiects so on the other side doth it encourage them confidently to open their mindes and in dutifull manner to vnfold themselves vnto their so louing and astable a s u rai ne and whereas the no vulgar praise of your ma est es p e you haue made open and often profession of your vigilancie and care to aduance the diuine honor of our sa christ and his most sacred religion then what faithfull ch an should slagger or feare to lay open and deliuer publikely that which he assureth himselfe to be ver expedient necessarie and a reeable towards the furnishing and se ting forward of so heauenly a worke moreouer if i your maiesties poore subiect haue by studie at home and trauaile abroad attained vnto any small talent of learning and knowledge to whom is the vse and fruite thereof more due then vnto my so gra ous and withall so learned a liege is it a dutifull manner of vnfolding your selfe to charge his maiesties gouernment with persecution and that of mens studies with persecuting heauily the sincere professors of the onely true catholike faith with molesting grieuously great numbers of most ciuill biects with mingling his gouernment with bitter stormes of persecution to threaten him with feare of rebellion or treason indeede i must needes say you vnfold your selfe perhaps more than you would for whereas your desire is to lie hid vnder the cloake of commending his maiestie for exceeding mildnes clemencie affabilitie ampc before you are aware the truth of your opinion breakes out and bewraies it selfe to all the world finally for a proofe of my sinceritie affection and dutifull loue towards your maiestie this may i iustly say that in time of vncertaine fortune when assured friends are most certainely tried i both suffered disgrace and hinderance for it being stiled in print a scotist in faction therein farther employing my pen in atvvo solde discourse which i hope hath been presented to the view of your maiestie the one containing a defence of your highnes honour the other of your title and interest of the crowne of england and if then my zeale and loue of truth and obligation to your maiestie drew me out of the compasse of mine owne profession to treate of law courses i trust your benigne grace will now licence me out of the same fountaine of ruencie and like zeale vnto god t uth no lesse respecting your maiesties eternall honour and heauenly inheritance something to say in matters of diuinitie hauing been the best part of my studie for more then thrise seuer yeares the late quarrels between the professed and secret traitors the jesuit and priests haue made all man of any iudgement able to discerne what disgraces and hinderances either part hath by other when both parts can so easily and suddenly agree with the good liking of your lay papists the best seruice you doe his maiestie in this book is that you confesse so plainly that both his honour and his title to the crowne of england were not onely called into question but iniured and denied by your popish saction and yet this intelligence you giue him is no newes for it was discouered before out of a letter of parsons in the jesuit defence against the secular priests whereinto i may conueniently enter with that golden sentence with which your maiestie began the conference holden in ia y last betweene certaine of your cts about some controue sie r ligion a ioue principium conformable to that in holy writ i a d omega that is the begianing and the end saith our lord and ying it vnto princes i may be bolde to say that nothing is more expedient and necessarie for kings nothing more honourable and of be assurance for their estate then that in the very beginning of their a gne they take especiall o der that the suprea ne and most pu ssa t m narch of heauen and earth be purely and vprightly serued aswell in their owne exemplar liues as throughout their dominions for of almighty god his meere bouncde and great grace they receiue and holde their d adems and cely seep ers and cannot possesse and enioy them their mighty forces and most prudent counsailes notwithstanding one day longer then during his d e will and pleasure which that wise king witnesseth speaking in the person of god wisedome per me reges regnant by me kings doe raigne and nabuchodonozer sometime king of babilon was turned out to grase with beast for seuen yeeres and made to know and confesse that the highest doth comma d ouer the kingdomes of man and disposeth of them as pleaseth his d vine wisedome but i neede not stand vpon this poynt being to well knowne and duely confessed by your ma es e his maiestie wisely and fitly applied the saying of the poet to signifie that whatsoeuer we vndertake must be begun in the name of god with desire and trust of his blessing but what conformitie hath that of christ either with virg eclog theoc it idyl the poets sentence or his maiesties purpose or your owne application our sauiour truly professes of himselfe that he is r amp alpha and omega the beginning and the ending which is which was and which is to come the first and the last that is eternall neither the poet nor the king our of the p t intend to speake any thing of god eternitie neither can you reasonably apply that speech of our sauiour to secure princes in their estate if they begin their gouernment with prouiding for obedience to god by true religion but how little agreement there is between christs speech and the poets it may easily appeare by this that if his maiestie in stead of abs loue principiu should haue said i am alpha and omega or christ is alpha and omega no man could haue vnderstood his meaning by his words but thence there be in this our most miserable age great diuersities of religions and but one onely wherewith god is truely serued and pleased as saith the apostle one body one spirit as you are called into one hope of your vocation one lord one faith one baptisme my most humble suite and supplication to your high maiestie is that you to your eternall good will imbra e maintaine and set forth that onely true catholike and apostolike faith wherein all your most royall progenitors liued and died or if you cannot be wonne so soone to alter that religion in which it hath been your misfortune to haue been bred and brought vp that then in the meane season you will not so heauily persecute the sincere professors of the other it is an easie matter to perswade his maiestie to maintaine and set foorth the onely true catholike and apostolike faith that is to doe that he doth alreadie but the romane religion hath neuer an one of these properties as it will appeare in the suruay of your reformation diverse of his maiesties progenitors liued and died in the profession of true religion many yeeres before a number of your popish heresies were hatcht neither doth hee now maintainc it because by god speciall prouidence he hath been brought vp in it but for that as it appeares in the confession of scotland after long and due examination his maiestie is thoroughly resolued in the truth by the word and spirit of god who would thinke that hee which a little before iustlie commended his maiestie for exceeding clemencie mildnes louingnes and affablenes should now challenge him for persecuting heauily the sincere professors of the onely true catholike and apostolike faith very many vrgent and for ible reasons might be produced in fauour and de e ce of the catholike romane religion whereof diverse haue bin in most learned treatises tendered to your maiestie already wherefore i will onely touch three two of them chosen out of the subiect of this booke the third selected from a sentence of your maiesties recorded in the aforesaid conference i doubt not but if those learned treatises you bragge of be come to his maiesties hands either they haue had or shal ere long receiue sufficient answere in the meane while let vs consider these your reasons and because that argument is as most sensible so best assured which proceedeth from a principle that is either euident in it selfe or else granted and confessed for true my first proofe shall be grounded vpon that your maiesties owne resolute and constant opinion as it appeareth in the said conference to wit that no church ought further to separate it selfe from the church of rome either in doctrine or ceremonie then she hath departed from her selfe vvhen she vvas in her flourishing and best estate from whence i deduce this reason the principall pillers of the church of rome in her most flourishing estate taught in all poynts of religion the same doctrine that she now holdeth and teacheth and in expresse tearmes condemneth for error and heresie most of those articles which the protestant esteeme to be the principall parts of their reformed gospell therefore if your maiestie will resolutely imbrace and constantly defend that doctrine which the roman church maintained in her most flourishing estate you must forsake the protestant and take the catholike into your princely protection the most flourishing and best estate of the church of rome is that out of question of the sinceritie whereof wee haue witnes in the rom scripture from which no church ought or may depart not because they may not dissent from the church of rome but because they must hold the true faith for which the apostle commends the church of rome that then was the antecedent of your reason is false the church of rome in the apostles time did not teach many of those points that the popish roman church now holds witnes the epistle to the romanes wherein diverse maine matters of her faith are recorded to demonstrate vnto your maiestie that we now hold in all poynts the very same doctrine which the most approoued auncient doctors and holy fathers held and deliuered because it is too long for an epistle i reserue it to the booke it selfe for the poynts it handleth and will here briefly note out of it some such old reprooued errors that the protestant doe reuiue receiue and auowe as the very sinnewes of their gospell the most approued ancient doctors amp holy fathers were the apostles with whom how you shew your agreement in the points this booke handles wee shall see in the particulars all other writers haue those properties in a farre inferiour degree from among whom if i would deale strictly with you i might pick the fathers of the greeke churches and all those of the latin that were not members of the romane as it was a distinct church from all other for so is the ambros de sacra lib c prosper de lib a b ad russin romane church conceiued and spoken of by his maiestie but i will not presse you so hard though i may chance to put you in minde of it now and then all points that haue been reprooued by some of the ancient writers are not errors and many times the same words haue not the same meaning martin luther the ring leader of the new pretended reformation layeth for the ground worke of his religion that man is iustified by by faith only or by faith a one vvere english so is not by only faith aug d amp openbus cap cap only saith and in this he is applauded and followed of all protestant and yet as testifieth the most sound witnes of antiquitie s austin that only faith is sufficient to saluation was an error sprung vp in the apostles dayes against which the catholike epistles of s peter and s iames and s john were principally directed and the author of that error was that infamous sorcerer simon magus as the blessed martyr ireneus hath recorded in his first booke against heresies for the doctrine of iustification by faith onely i referre the reader to the article of iustification that we are vnlike the heretikes of whom s augustine speakes it may thus ap the faith they so magnified was a dead faith the apostle de side oper cap non quale ampc austin in refutation of them speaks not of euery kind by which we beleeue in god but of that wholesome and truly angelicall faith the workes whereof proceede from loue and againe how long therefore will they be deceiued that promise themselues euerlasting life by a dead faith besides they despised good workes as needles either before or after iustification hoc paulum arbitra sunt dic re alum ampc they thought saith augustine that paul wild vs to doe euill that good might come of it but it was not the apostles meaning saith he that by the professing and inioyning of faith vt opera iu stitia contem na tur good workes of righteousnes should be despised but that euery man might know that he may be iustified iamsi legis opera no prae esterint though he haue not done the workes of the law before for they follow him that is iustified not goe before him that is to be iustified yes cap simon the sorcerer doubted not blasphemously to affirme that the commandements of holy life were giuen by the angels that made the world who thereby brought man into sla rie of whom d b p cap aug theod ret saith that because man are saued by grace and faith therefore he gaue by all meanes to commit wickednes an other principall piller of fryer

de hares cap he saith augustine made two diverse beginnings each contrary to other and both eternall and from these two natures and substances of good and euill so that he ascribed the beginning of sinne not to the freedome of will but to the substance of the aduerse faction yes so faire proceeded the manichees that they affirmed co ma ich lib cap saith the same augustine that euery liuing creature had two soules a gente l gente brarum one from light another from darknes manes brought in fatall necessitie history l b cap saith socrates and tooke away free will we contrariwise acknowledge that there is but one god or author of all things created that he made vs in our kinde perfectly good that sinne came in first by freedome of will both in man and angels and that by free will without any necessitie of constraint it is daily committed it appeares further to our comfort in that place of pr al co pelag s hierome that the catholikes or true christians in his time were in like sort charged by the pelagians with the manichees error in denying free will because they would not confesse that a man may be without sinne if he will which is one point of difference between vs and the papists one pro lus an erronius origenist taught that sinne was not taken away in baptisme but only couered as is recorded by that holy man and auncient father e anius m per ins in the name of

confesse that the sproutes and branches of concupiscence abide in vs yes that sinne dwels in vs by which the diuell preuailes the apostle saith methodius rom seemes to make a three fold law the first the law of the minde according to that good that is ingrafted in vs the second by the assault of the diuell vrging and distracting the minde by imaginations full of passion the third which triumphs in the flesh by sinne which the apostle calles the law of sinne dwelling in our members that hieronym contra pelag lib in princip hierom is of our opinion in this point it appeares in his booke against

and fleshly that it could not deceiue any one learned priest but onely some few simple and carnall woman yet this our english champion blusheth not to affirme that marriage is not only equall but better also in diverse respects than virginitie s austin was neither so ancient nor so holie as s paul hauing him on our side we neede not feare the other but the report you make of him is vntrue for these are his words in english august retract lib cap this heresie preuailed so much in the citie of rome that it is said to haue throwne into the estate of mariage euen some vowed virgin of whose chastitie there had been no suspition before so farre is augustine from calling them simple and carnall beside he addes though you will not be knowne of it that he frangebat weakned and ouerthrew the holy single life of holie man by rehearsing and commending the fathers abraham isaack iacob who were married man and whereas he saith it could not come to the deceiuing of aliquorum sacerdotum any

appointed fish daies superstitiously abused by you are ciuilly retained by vs with lesse riot than your selues doe vse vigilantius was sharpely reprooued by s hierome in a booke written against him and hath been euer since vnto this day esteemed a wicked heretike for denying prayer to saints and honour to be done vnto their reli es and yet what poynt of doctrine is more currant among the protestant than this in censura sua in illum hieronymilibrum erasmus not without cause findes want of modestie in that treatise of hieroms he might haue found want of truth too if vigilantius held no worse opinion than those you recite but of the former namely praying to saints neither the one nor the other speakes a word and indeede it was not the manner in those daies to pray to the martyrs but

sundrie other heades of the protestant religion by all approued antiquitie reproued aad condemned that i passe not the boundes of an epistle and seeme ouer tedious vnto your maiestie especially considering that these are sufficient to conuince that those points wherein the protestant affirme the present church of rome to haue so farre degenerate from the auncient are the very essentiall parts of saith then maintayned by the romans and the contrary opinions nothing else but wicked heresies of old inuented and obstinately helde against the same roman see euen as they are now our time and of old also condemned by the same church in her most flourishing and best estate wherefore your most excellent maiestie being resolute in that singular good opinion that no church ought farther to depart from the church of rome then shee is departed from her selfe in her flourishing estate must needes recall the church of england from such extrauagant opinions to ioyne with the roman church in the aforesaid articles which shee in her best time helde for parts of pure faith and in all others also which they cannot directly proue in a lawful disputation before your maiestie to haue beene altred by her particularly naming the point of doctrine the author o the chaunge the time and place where and when ht liued who followed him who resisted him and such other like circumstances which all bee easily shewed in euery such reuolte or innouation because th vigilant care of the pastors of christs flocke haue bin alwaies so great as no such things could be vnknowne let slippe or vnrecorded thus much for my first reason collected from the vntruth of the protestant religion what are nine points to nine skore that i may speake the least and yet it is not prooued that any of these were held by the romanes whose faith rom s paul commends nor indeed euer can be it is enough for vs if we can shew by record of scripture that the doctrine the church of rome now holds is not that she maintained in her best estate which we often haue done and alwaies will be ready to doe is it not a good plea in law to prooue by ancient euidences and deedes that the land was mine vnlesse i can shew when and how the possession of euery house medow close ampc was lost yet it stands you vpon to proue how you came by it and by what right you hold it which you must doe when all comes to all by the scripture or else your title will neuer be good the second shall be grounded vpon the vngodlines of it where i wil let passe that high point of impiety that they make god who is goodnes it selfe the author of all wicked actions done in the world tvvo monstrous vntr haue shewed else vvhere and will besides say nothing of that their blasphemie against our sauiour iesus christ that he ouercome with the paines of his passion vpon the crosse did doubt if not dispaire of his owne saluation being vnwilling to touch any other poynts then such as are afterwards discussed in this booke you may well let both these passe for they are your slanders not our opinions as hath been shewed sufficiently in my ansvvere to the articles part article and part article the disdaine is at your idolagrie not at the elsewhere the triumphant citizens of heauen who enioy the presence of god and happiest life that can be imagined are by protestant disdainfullie termed dead man and esteemed neither to haue credit with god to obtaine any thing nor any care or compassion on man among whom they once liued and conuersed so kindly the saints departed we loue and honour but are forced to call them dead man as de vera relig cap austin doth by reason of your idolatry with the same disdaine in our weake measure with which the philipp gal apostle disgraced circumcision of their credit with god we doubt not their care of man we denie not but see my ansvvere to articl par article h what does your po e that may release them all and will not wee know no calling they haue to become our mediatours with dishonour to god and christ and as for the poore soules departed who in purgatorie fire pay deare for their former delightes and pleasures they depriue them of all humane succour by teaching the world to beleeue that there is no such matter see my ansvvere to articl part article l vtterly vntrue we depriue them of nothing that god in the scripture allowes them prooue your purgatorie thence and we will confesse our error concerning vs christians yet liuing on earth there is no lesse impietie in their opinions for they teach that the best christian is no better in effect then a whited sepulchre being inwardly full of all wickednes and mischiefe and onlie by an outwarde imputation of christs righteousnes vnto them are accepted of god for iust to thinke that there is inherent in the soule of man any such grace of god as doth cleanse it from sinne and make the man iust in his sight is with them to raze the foundation of religion and to make christ a pseudochrist wherein i know not whether they be more enuious against the good of man then they are iniurious either to the inestimable value of christs blood as though it could not deserue any better estate for his fauourites or vnto the vertue and efficacie of the holy ghost as not being able by likeliehood to purge mens soules from sinne and endue them with such heauenly qualities i omitte the disgrace thereby don to the blessed god head it selfe making the holie of holies father willing to couer and cleake our iniquitie then to cure it and contrarie to his infinite goodnes to loue them whom h seeth defiled with all manner of abhominations we acknowledge euery true christian to be righteous in the sight of god after iustification by corinthian inherent though imperfect righteousnes and account none whited sepulchers but those that bragge or make shee of holines matth being but hypocrites we ascribe our iustification wholy and onely to the mercie of god in rom forgiuing our sinnes for christs obedience by accounting faith to vs for rightcousnes we envy not the good of man but preferre god truth before mans pride our sauiour christs sacrifice we megnifie as infinitly perfect but wee know the whole e t thereof is not perfected at once in vs though the holie ghost be of infinit power which in respect of vs is limited by the gratious and wise prouidence of god we teach that god doth not onely couer our sinnes by forgiuing them but cure our corruption by abolishing it wholy yet corinthian rom corinthian by little and little his loue depends not vpon our righteousnes for he loued vs rom ioh when wee were most vnrighteous but vpon the estate of gal rom being his sonnes members of his beloued son iesus christ and ephe elected to adoption and saluation by him before the foundation of the world was laid vnto these paradoxes impious against god and slaunderous to man if it will please your maiestie to adde the prophane carnallity of some other poynts of the protestant doctrine you will doubtles in short time loath it as for example i hat it is as good and godly by eating to feede the bodie as to chastize it by fasting that it is as holy to fulfill the fleshly desires of it by mariage as by continencie to mortifie them yes that it is flat against the word of god to vow virginitie and also contrarie to his blessed will to bestowe our goods on the poore and to giue our selues wholy to prayer and fasting all which this aduocate of the english congregation teacheth express e is this the puritie of the gospell or is it not rather the high way to epicurisme and to all worldly vanitie and iniquitie to chastice the bodie by fasting wee hold it not only good but of tentimes corinthian necessary though we acknowledge neither merit nor satisfaction in it which accompanie your popish fasts mortification of rom column all kindes of lusts not only that one we account a necessarie part of sanctification neither doe wee allow mariage to fulfill the lust of the flesh corinthian but to remedie it vowing of virginitie we approoue not because a man cannot be sure that he shall keepe his vow alwaies though for a time he be able besides all lawful vowes being things indifferent corinthian charitie must giue iudgement of excediencie in making th n see my ansvv the of v to make prayer and fasting our whole worke is to liue in the world without a calling to giue away our goods to the poore so to become chargeable to others is to tempt god and burthen the church to doe it with opinion of merit is popish pride against god glorie i neede not ioyne hereunto that they teach it to be impossible to keepe god commaundements and therefore in vaine to goe about it and fa ther that the best worke of the righteous man is defiled with sinne wherefore as good for him to leane all vndone as to doe any nay if this position of theirs were true it would to low necessarilie that all man were bound vnder paine of damnation neuer to doe any good deede to long as they liue for that their good deede being stayned with sinne cannot but deserue the hyre of sinne which according to the apostle is death euerlasting if your maiesties important affaires would once permit you to consider maturely of these impieties and many other like absurdities wherewith the protestant doctrine is stuffed i dare be bold to say that you would speedely either commaund them to reforme themselues and amend their errors or fairely giue them their congie we say it is see my ansvvere to articl part article impossible to keepe god commandements perfectly to iustification but wee denie that therefore it is in vaine to goe about it yes we truly affirme that we are corinthian bound to doe our best endeuour and shall haue acceptation and reward of our workes from god though not vpon any desert of ours o the article part article that our best workes are tainted with imperfections we professe plainly that they are therefore to be left vndone neither we say nor you can prooue the imperfection that cleaues to them is by all good meanes to be auoyded but the workes to be performed for it is not the worke but the imperfection in it that is forbidden i will close vp this my second reason with this epiphoneme that it is impossible for a protestant firmely cleaning to the grounds of his ovvne religion to hope for any saluation for they doe and needes must graunt that no man can be saued without a liuely faith and also that a liuely faith cannot be without charitie for otherwise it were dead now then to the purpose no protestant can haue charitie for as witnesseth saint john this is the charitie of god that vve keepe his commaundements but it is impossible according to the protestant to keepe the commandements therfore also impossible to haue charitie vvhich is the ulnes of the lavve and consequently impossible to haue a liuely faith which cannot be without charitie and so finally through want of that l uely feeling faith whereby they should lay hold on christs righteousnesse to hale and apply that vnto themselues they can haue no hope at all of any fauour and grace at god hands without which they must needes assure themselues of eternall damnation in steede of their pretended certain of saluation true charitie though not perfect may be had in this life and by it the commandements of god may bee and are kept though not perfectly so that a protestant firmely cleaning to the grounds of his religion may yet hope for saluation to these two arguments gathered out of the treatise following i adde a third collected from these your owne memorable wordes related in the aboue named conference viz are wee now come to that passe that we must appeache constantine of popery and superstition which argueth that your maiestie iudgeth them to haue little regard of either piety or ciuility that would admit such a thought into their minde as that the first christian emperour our most renowned countriman should bee nousled and brought vp in superstition wherein your maiestie hath great reason for he was most carefully instructed and taught the christian religion by such holy confessors whose sinceritie in faith had bin tried in the hotte furnace of many strange persecutions and he farther had the good happe to see and heare together in the first generall councell of nice many of the holiest and best learned bishops of christendom therefore is it most vnlikely that so royall a person deuoted to religion add hauing so good meanes to attayne to the perfect knowledge thereof as no man could haue better should neuerthelesse in the purest time of it be mis ledde into errour and superstition if then it may be prooued that this most christian emperour the glittering ornament of our noble iland did beleeue such articles of the present roman

with these whome doubtles most man deeme to be pittifullie deceiued now that constantine was of the same opinion in matter of religion with the present church of rome may euidently bee gathered out of this that followeth he that denies constantine to haue been a worthie a singular instrument of god for the good of his church wrongs the worthie emperour and sinnes against god but the triall of doctrine is to be fetched not from the opinions and examples of man though neuer so holie but from the holie of holies it may not seeme strange if superstition were crept into the church before constantines time when the thes apostle witnesses that euen in his daies the mysterie of iniquitie was alreadie begun first he was so affectionate vnto the signe of the crosse that hee would haue it gloriouslie appeare both abroade in his business and at home in his pallace and in the middest of the citie of o e with this posie in this signe of saluation i haue deliuered the cittie w it also he blessed his visage with fasting and other corporall affliction he chastized his body that he might please god he with incredible admiration honored prosessed virgin and made lawes in their fauour he builded many churches in honour of the apostles and martyrs and as s chrysostom recordeth he that was reuested in purple went to embrace the sepulchres of s peter and s paul and all princely state laide aside stood humbly praying vnto the saints that they would bee intercessors for him vnto god he farther tooke order for the burying of his owne body in the middest of the tombes of the twelue apostles that after his death he might be partaker of the prayers which should be there offered in the honour of the apostles neither was he frustrated of his holy desire for as it followeth in the chapter of the same booke at his funerals the people ioyning with the priests with many cares and great sighs powred out prayers for the good emperours soule againe at a feast which he held at the dedication of the church built by ierusalem some of cleargie preached and expounded the holy scriptures and othe me with vnbloudie sacrifice and st all cons cr lions appeased the godhead and prayed

lwell weighing that the whole frame of their doctrine tendeth to the disgracing of god and his saintes to the discouragement of man from well doing and doth as it were loosen the reines vnto all fleshly liberty will in time make a most godly resolution to imitate that famous emperour constantine he contrary to his former education embraced with a h spower that same romane religion which we now professe and which is worthy to be obserued he feared nothing the contrarie disposition of the multitude or greater part of his subiects that were wholy led another way but following the blessed

the roman superstition at no hand to be approoued or tolerated pardon me deere soueraigne if before i finish this argument i seeme ouer bold here to present vnto your memory that all your most

generall purpose with amendment of their particular error if there be any merit in these actions as you teach they are much beholden to those princes who make their deedes truly meritorious by the right vse of them if all these reasons and exceeding manie other which might be mu stered and produced to the same purpose will not suffice to effect in your maiestie a loue and desire to embrace that auncient roman f which all your renowned progenitors so highly reuerenced loued and esteemed yet let me prostrate on my knee most humblie beg your highnes in the name of thowsandes that so farre forth they may preuaile with you as you will not permitte those rigorous lawes framed against recusant catholikes to bee put in practize and executed for how can it seeme comfortable to reason in your maiesties deepe wisedome and iudgement that your louing subiects should by compulsion and constrainte vnder that intollerable penaltie of losse of all their goodes conforme themselues to such articles of religion that by the purest antiquitie were censured to be erronious and execrable and what misery and pitty were it to driue them perforce either to swallow downe the deadly poyson of their soules or else to endure besides the disgrace of the state the losse of their worldly wealth and liberty consider and weigh with your selfe y most gratious liege whether it will not be thought ouer great seuerity to presse man euen against humane nature and condition with patience to heare their owne profession and beleefe both vntruely slaundered and most bitterly reuiled amp inueighed against as in

saintes senseles dead man his vicar and vicegerent on earth antichrist and euery catholike an idolater with infinit other intollerable reproches our constant hope euen yet though against hope is that your maiestie out of your owne sweete naturall disposition and most milde carriage in gouernment hitherto will not onely moderate but suspende all such extreamitie and not suffer it to be extended

may be obiected that they doe not conforme themselues vnto a statute lawe made against their religion be it so then their religion toward god not any contempt of their lawful superiour doth commaund them from the conformity which is pardonable considering that they be no inuenters or followe s of nouelties but onely hold on and perseuer in the aith of their forefathers and what subiect is there

neuer suffer my selfe to be persvvaded that your maiestie vvill euer permit it before i see it done if it be further obiected vvhy should not your maiestie asvvell punish catholikes in your kingdomes as catholikes doe protestant in some other country i ansvvere that in all country vvhere multitudes of both sorts are mixed as it is in england the protestant are tolerated as in france poland bohemia the catholike states of germany and ca tounes according to that of the gospell suffer both the wheate and co kle to grow vntill haruest in spaine and italie where s arse any protestant be the case is otherwise but vvhat is that to england vvhere are very many catholike recusants and catholikely affected in euery degree not onely of the temporaltie but in the clergie also hardly of the highest degrees of honour to be excepted therefore for their number and qualitie to be tolerated there is great reason to beare with protestant in any country because there is no apparant shew of idolatry in their seruing of god nor any foreign power vpon whom they must depend but papists are euen outwardly also idolaters and vpon paine of damnation must obey the popes definitiue sentence who cannot erre in seate of iudgment against all the princes in christendom lastly if there were no other cause but the innumerable benefits which euery degree and order of man throughout england haue and do daily receiue from our most catholike ancestors as the constituting of so many holesome lawes founding of so many honourable and rich rewards of learning as bishopricks cathedrall churches deaneries arch deaconries residencies prebends and benefices the erecting and building of so goodly schooles colledges and hospitals and endowing of them with so ample possessions which all proceeded out of the bowels of the true wisedome pietie and vertue of their catholike religion is not this much more then a sufficient motiue why their heires in faith should be most benignely and louingly dealt with and not for the profession of the same religion so seuerely afflicted let the protestant in those country where they are most molested appeare and shew that their predecessors in beliefe haue been so beneficiall vnto the publike weale and i dare vndertake that for their ancestors sake they shall finde much more fauour then we sue for wherefore they can haue no iust cause to repine at your maiesties goodnes if vpon man of that religion which hath been so beneficiall vnto your whole realme you take extraordinary compassion this makes against you rather than for you for the strengthening of the popish clergie hath alwaies been the weakening of the prince and the establishing of the popes absolutenes aboue the authoritie of the magistrate therefore that the zeale of our ancestors may not become againe dangerous to our state it is not onely meete but necessarie also to keepe out popish persons and opinions it lying then in your maiesties free choise and election whether you will enlarge and extend your royall fauour vnto an infinite number of your most dutifull and affectionate subiects who are the most vnwilling in the world to transgresse any one of your lawes were they not thereunto compelled by the law of god or else vtterly to begger and to vndoe both them and theirs for their constant profession of the ancient romane faith my confidence in the sweete prouidence of the almightie is that he will mercifully incline your royall heart to chuse rather to pardon then to punish because the way of mercie consorteth better with your kinde and tender nature it is of better assurance to continue your peaceable and prosperous raigne it will purchase mercie at god hands according to his owne promise blessed be the mercifull for they shall obtaine mercie i neede not adde what a consolation and comfort it will be to many score thousands of your subiects and the greatest obligation that can be deuised to binde them to you and yours for euer now what applause and congratulation from foreign catholike country would follow this your famous fact vndoubtedly all the glorious company of kings and queenes now in heauen of whom you are lineally descended and among all the rest namely your most sacred and deare mother that endured so much for her constancie in the same catholike faith cannot but take it most kindly if for god and their sakes you take into your princely protection their followers in the romane faith and de fend them from oppression thus most humbly crauing pardon of your highnes if i haue in any thing exceeded the limits of my bounden dutie i beg your blessed sauiour to endue you both with the true knowledge of his diuine veritie and with the spirit of fortitude to embrace and defend it constantly or at the least gratiously to tolerate and permit it your most excellent maiesties most obedient and loyall subiect and servant w b what course will best please god in this difference of profession not humane policie but diuine truth must determine in which if we sincerely obey god we shall not need to depend vpon the liking or misliking either of foreign country or kings and queenes departed who either are no saints of god if they loue popish idolatry or if they be saints loue it not gentle reader i meane not here to entertayne thee with many wordes the principall cause that moued me to write was the honour and glorie of god in defence of his sacred verity then the imploying of his talent bestowed vpon me as well to sortifie the weaker sort of catholikes in their faith as to call backe and leade other who wander vp and downe like to lost sheepe after their owne fancies into the right way the like reasons haue drawne me to this suruey of your reformation with a resolute purpose to acknowledge any truth that you shall shew me though it be against the iudgment of all the churches in christendom i tooke in hand particularly the confutation of this booke not onely for that i vvas thereunto requested by a friend of good intelligence and iudgement who thought it very expedient but also because perusing of it i found it penned more schollerlike then the protestant vse to doe ordinariely for first the pointes in controuersie are set downe dist ctly and for the most part truely afterward in confirmation of their opinion the chiefe arguments are produced from both scriptures fathers and reason which are not vulgar but called out of their rabbins luther peter ma tir caluin kemnitius and such like though he name them not lastly he placeth some obiections made in fauour of the catholike doctrine and answereth to them as well as he could and which j speake to his commendation doth performe all this very briefely and clearely so that to speake my o i on freely i haue not seene any booke of like quantitie published by a protestant to containe either more matter or deliuered in better method and consequently more apt to deceiue the simple especially considering that he withal counterfeiteth to come as neere vnto the romane church as his tender conscience will permitte him whereas indeede he walketh as wide from it as any other noueller of this age if the writings of protestant haue bin lesse scholerlike than in the handling of controuersies it were fit they should haue bin whose fault is it but the papists whom they haue bin forced to answere in their owne kinde it is not vnknowne to any of our english rhemists or romanists that doctor fulke long since desired to haue the matter brought to an issue and tried by syllogismes the very iudgement seate of true reason if you had knowne master perkins life as well as you see his learning you would neuer haue accused him of counterfeiting whereof also me thinkes he may easily be acquited by that cleerenes which you discerne and acknowledge in him wherefore i esteemed my spare time best imployed about the discouering of it being as it vvere an abridgement of the principall controuersies of these times and doe endeuour after the same scholasticall manner vvithout all superfluity of vvordes no lesse to maintaine and defend the catholike party then to confute all such reasons as are by m perkins alleadged for the contrarie reade this short treatise good christian diligently for thou shalt finde in it the marrovv and pith of many large volumes contracted and drawne into a narrovv revvme and read it ouer as it becommeth a

farre from the authour vvith a dutch composer and ouerseene by an vnskilfull corrector the greatest of them shall be amended in the end of the booke i will endeuour the like or greater shortnes and plainnes if i can desiring nothing more of the christian reader than to remember that hee is to seeke the truth without partialitie the place to seeke it in is the scripture the meanes to find it the right vse of true reason he that hunts for it in mens writings either findes it not at all or at the least hath no certaine knowledge that he hath found it he that will trust other mens words rather than his owne eyes deserues in reason to be deceiued before the printing of this part was finished i heard that m perkins was dead i am sorrie that it commeth forth to late to doe him anie good yet his worke liuing to poison others a preseruatiue against it is neuerthelesse necessarie it would haue done master perkins good to see by experience how vaine it is for man to striue against god for the pope but it would haue been little to your aduantage to haue had such an aduersarie right worshipfull it is a notable policy of the diuell which he hath put into the heads of sundry man in this age to thinke that our religion and the religion of the present church of rome are all one for substance and that they may be reunited as in their opinion they were before writings to this effect are spread abroad in the french tongue and respected of english protestant more then is meete or ought to be for let man in shew of moderation pretend the peace and good estate of the catholike church as long as they will this vnion of the two religions can neuer be made more then the vnion of light and darkenes maister perkins in the epistle dedicatorie it is a policie of the diuell to thinke that our religion and the religion of the present church of rome are all one in substance or that they may be reunited before i am to deliuer my opinion concerning this point i had neede to be enformed what this author meaneth by these words our religion for there being great diuersities of pretended religions currant in the world all contrary to the church of rome how can i certainlie know whether of them h professeth wherefore good sir may it please you to declare what religion you vnderstand when you say our religion is it that which martin luther a licentious fryer first preached in germany or rather that which the martiall minister zwinglius contended with sword and shield to set vp in switzerland or perhaps that which john caluin by sedition wrought into geneua expelling the lawful magistrate thence and by the ayde of beza a dissolute turnecoate spread into many corners of france or if by your religion you meane only to comprehend the religion now practised in england yet are you farther to shewe whether you vnderstand that established by the state or the other more refined as it is thought by many and embraced by them who are called puritanes for of their leauen sauoureth that position of yours that the article of christs descent into bell crept into the creede by negligence and some other such like in this booke these principall diuisions of the new gospell to omit sundrie sub diuisions being famous and receiued of diverse in england according to each mans phantasie it is meete you expresse whether of them you speake of that it may be dulie considered how the romane religion and it agree and what vnion may be made betweene them is this no superfluitie of words what reasonable man can doubt that master perkins by our religion meanes as you say afterward the religion now professed in england for your word practised is too skant for doctrine some points whereof fall not into practise if it be contrarie to the church of rome it is easily answered without any such inquirie that contraries cannot be vnited if difference in some points make a diverse religion how many kindes are there amongst you papists let the franciscans and dominicans goe with all the rest of former times what say you to these maine points iustification in albert pighius controuers pighius predestination in bellarm de grat amp lib arb bellarmine free will in lib c barthol camerarius de lib arb bartholomew camerarius three pillers of your church the difference between article part article protestant and puritanes as you call them is not in any essentiall point of faith but in matters of outward gouernment and ceremonies and this shall appeare if we doe but a little consider how they of the romane church haue rased the foundation for though in words they honour christ yet in deede they turne him to a pseudo christ and an idoll of their owne braine now if you meane the hotchpot h and confusion of all these new religions together as by the opposition here vnto the church of rome and by the arti les following may be gathered then i am cleere for you in this that there can be no more concord betweene these two religions then there is betweene light and darknes faith and insidel tie christ and beliall notwithstanding i thinke that the reason by you produced to proue the impossibilitie of this vnion is of no value to it that they of the romane church aue razed the foundation for though in vvords they honour christ yet indeede they turne him into a pseudochrist and an doll of their braine a very sufficient cause no doubt of eternall breach and diuision if it could be verisied but how proue you that we romane catholikes who beleeue iesus christ to be perfect god and perfect man and the onely redeemer of mankinde make him a false christ and an idoll or before you goe about to proue it tell me i pray you how this can well stand with your owne definition of a reformed catholike in your preface there you affirme him to be a catholike reformed to your liking that holdeth the same necessarie heads of religion vvith the romane church now can there be any more necessarie head of religion than to haue a right faith in christ can any other foundation be laid besides iesus christ if then your reformed catholike must agree with the romane church in ne essarie heads of religion as you hold he must either the romane church th not the foundation and maketh not christ a pseudochrist as you say here or else you teach your dis iples very pernitiously to hold the same necessarie heads of religion with it it is no confusion to take from seuerall man seuerall opinions agreeing with the word of god luther hauing been a long time kept in the darknes of p pcrie could not by and by discerne the truth in all points was not your superstition both for doctrine and ceremonics patcht vp peece by peece as it could procure allowance from time to time yes was not the truth of religion made manifest by little and little in the church as god gaue learned man occasion of studie and a blessing in their studie against the poyson of heretikes such hath been and such alwaies will be the course of the gospell that truth will be more and more knowne as there is more opposition against it and as man bestow more paines in reading praying and studying to denie the reason or argument is to denie the consequence not the antecedent but you grant the consequence viz that razing the foundation and turning christ into a pseudochrist is a sufficient cause of eternall breach onely you denie the antecedent that the church of rome doth so at the least as well as you prooue a part article that the church of england holding the same opinions of christ haue no faith no religion no church no christ ampc but let vs see how you disprooue the antecedent if your reformed catholike say you must agree with the romane church in many heads of religion either the romane church razeth not the foundation or else you teach your disciples very pernitiously to hold the same necessarie heads of religion with it but he must agree with it in many heads of religion therfore either the romane church razeth not the foundation or you teach your disciples very pernitiously to hold the same necessarie heads of religion with it i denie the consequence of your proposition because by paring of the errors which master perkins requires he shall keepe himselfe from razing the foundation though he hold the same necessary heads for example he must holde with you that a true christia must haue a right faith in christ but he must reiect the faith you professe as not right again he must hold that no other foundation can be laid but iesus christ not that you lay him aright for the foundation they call him our lord but with this condition that the servant of servant of this lord may change and adde to his commaundements hauing so great a power that he may open and shut heauen to whom he will and bind the very conscience with his owne lawes and consequently be partaker of the spirituall kingdome of christ but to leaue to you the reconciliation of these places let vs examine briefly how you confirme your paradox that the church of rome maketh christ a false christ which you goe about to proue by foure instances the first is because the servant of his servant may chaunge and adde to his commandements hauing so great power that he may open and shut heauen to whom he will and bi de the very conscience with his owne lawes and consequently be partaker o the spirituall k ngdome of christ here are diverse reasons hu d vp in one but all of moment for all these seuerall faculties which the pope enioyeth being receiued by the free gift of christ and to be employed in his seruice only and to his honour and glorie are so farre off from making christ a pseudochrist that they doe highly recommend his most singular bountie towardes his followers without any derogation to his owne diuine prerogatiues he particulars shall be more particularly answered in their places hereafter now i say in a word that christs vicar cannot change any one of god commaundements nor adde any contrarie vnto them but may well enact and establish some other conformable vnto them which doe bind in conscience for that power is graunted of god to euery soueraigne gouernour as witnesseth s paul saying let euery soule be subiect to higher povvers and that as it is in the fifth verse following of necessitie not only for vvrath but also for conscience sake so that to at tribute power vnto one that is vnder christ to binde our consciences is not to make christ a pseudochrist but to glorifie him much acknowledging the power which it hath pleased him to giue vnto man in like manner what an absurde illation is that from the power to open and shut heauen gates which all both catholikes and protestant confesse to haue been giuen to s peter and the rest of the apostles to inferre that christ is made a pseudochrist as who should say the master spoiled himselfe of his supreame authoritie by appoynting a stevvard ouer his householde or a porter at his gates he must be both master and man too belike and thus much of the first instance first you begge the question in taking it as granted that the popes power is receiued of christ secondly it doth not follow that christ is not made a pseudochrist if the power be receiued of christ to be imployed in his seruice only for it may be imployed by the pope to another end than it is giuen by christ as an armie committed to a generall by his soueraigne may bee turned against the prince to his ouerthrow he that can the po e may dispense against the lav of atu e glossa ad caus q c auto i ate the pope pen eth against the apostle di ec r amp pr amp c dispense with god commandements so that either a man shall be freed from doing that which is inioyned or haue libertie to doe that which is forbidden can change god commandements but such dispensations haue been giuen by popes and may as well be still in all things inioyned by the commandements of god the law of the magistrate bindes man in conscience to obedience by vertue of the matter commanded in things indifferent the conscience is not alwaies charged with sinne where that which is appointed is not done but you papists as it appeares by your catechismes make the commandements of the church equall or superiour to god commandements the opening and shutting of heauen by the worke of the ministerie th ioh which is the power that was giuen to the apostles and ministers of the gospell is not to be executed at their pleasure but depends vpon the people as much as vpon them if not more for whosoeuer will repent and beleeue shall be saued though all the popes priests and ministers that euer were are and shall be would shut him out of heauen therefore the pope hath no authoritie nor power to open the doore to one man more than to another much lesse to let in and shut out whom he list he must open it if he be a minister of the gospell as much as lies in him to al if they wil enter they may without any further leaue or power from him againe they call him a sauiour but yet in vs in that he giues this grace vnto vs that by our merits we may partake in the merits of the saints come we now to the second it is that we make christ an idoll for albeit we call him a sauiour yet in vs in that he giues his grace to vs that by our merits we may be our owne sauiours ampc i meruaile in whom he should be a sauiour if not in vs what is he the sauiour of angels or of any other creatures i hope not but the mischiefe is that he giues grace to vs that thereby we may merite and so become our owne sauiours this is a phrase vnheard of among catholiks that any man is his owne sauiour neither doth it follow of that position that good workes are meritorious but well that we applie vnto vs the saluation which is in christ iesus by good works as the protestant auou h they doe by faith onely in which sence the apostle s paul saith to his deare disciple timothie for this doing thou shalt saue both thyselfe and them that heare thee and this doth no more diminish the glorie of our soueraigne sauiour infinit merits then to say that we are saued by faith only good works no lesse depending if not more aduancing christs merits then only faith as shall be proued hereafter more at large in the question of merits now that other good mens merits may steede them who want some of their owne may be deduced out of an hundred places of the scriptures namely out of those where god saith that for the sake of one of his true servant he will shew mercy vnto thousands as is expressely said in the end of the first commandement christ is a sauiour of vs by corinthian rom redeeming vs not a sauiour in vs by making vs redeeme our selues though the speech be not yours the matter is for if christ be therefore a sauiour because by his merits we are saued looke how much wee merit our saluation so much wee are sauiours of our selues yes how much merit there is in our workes so much there wanted in christs satisfaction or else our saluation is in part twice merited tim the minister saues not by meriting but by preaching the word of saluation works must needs diminish christs glorie more than faith because this saues not by meriting they doe the matter cannot be deduced from such places exod the mercie god shewes in that respect is either for the blessings of this life or at the most for the outward meanes of saluation and they acknowledge that he died and suffered for vs but with this caueat that the fault being pardoned we must satisfie for the temporall punishment either in this world or in purgatorie in like manner i answere vnto your third instance that for christ to haue taken away by his blessed passion the eternall paine due vnto our sinnes and to haue left a temporall to be satisfied by vs is not to make himselfe a false christ but a most louing kind and withall a most prudent redeemer wiping away that by himselfe which passed our forces and reseruing that to vs which by the helpe of his grace we well may and ought to doe not only because it were vnseemely that the parts of the body should be disproportionable to the head but also because it is reasonable as the apostle holdeth that we suffer here vvith christ before vve raigne vvith him in his kingdome to leaue halfe of our punishment for vs to beare is to be but halfe a sauiour and so a false christ there is neither kindnes nor wisedome in it to leaue either our saluation doubtfull or punishment for vs perhaps of yeeres or more in purgatorie that as rom christ hath been afflicted so should we taste of affliction it is proportionable and reasonable that wee should bee like him in making satisfaction for our sinnes by punishment is to make vs redeemers with him though not in the highest degree in a word they make him our mediatour of intercession vnto god but withall his mother must be the queene of heauen and by the right of a mother commaund him there thus in word they crie osanna but indeede they crucifie christ in your last instance you say that we make christ our mediator of intercession to god thinking out of your simplicity that therein we much magnifie him amp sing osanna vnto him whereas we hold it for no small disparagement vnto his diuine dignitie to make him our intercessor that is to pray him to pray for vs who is of himselfe right able to helpe vs in all we can demaund being aswell god as man and albeit one in thought singling out the humanitie of christ from his diuine nature and person might make it an intercessor for vs yet that being but a metaphysical conceipt to separate the nature from the person since the arrian heresie which held christ to be inferior to his father it hath not been practised by catholikes who alwaies pray our sauiour christ to haue mercy vpon vs neuer to pray for vs and consequentlie make him no mediator of intercession but of redemption and to come to your grieuous complaint that vvithall his mother must be queene of heauen and by right of a mother commaund him there who can sufficiently meruaile at their vnnaturall grosse pares who take it for a disgrace to the son to aduaunce his owne good mother or else who well in his wits considering christs bountie to strangers and his enemy will not be perswaded that on his best beloued mother he did bestow his most speciall fauours for hauing taken flesh of her hauing suckt her breasts amp receiued his nutriture and education of her in his tender yeares and being aswell followed of her as of any other is it possible that he should not be as good to her as to others vnto whom he was not at all beholding againe the very place of a mother requiring preheminence before all servant and subiects of what dignitie soeuer doth not the right rule of reason lead vs to thinke that christ the fountaine of all wisedome reple shed the b virgin mary his deare mother with such grace as should make her fit for that place it lying in his hands and free choise to doe it and therefore is she truely tearmed of holy and learned antiquity our lady and queene exalted aboue all quyers of angels that which you impute vnto vs farther that she must in the right of a mother commaund her son is no doctrine of the romane church nor said in all her seruice we say shevv thy selfe to be a mother but it is not added by commaunding thy son that is your glosse which is accursed because it corrupteth the text for it followeth in that place sumat per te preces ampc present our prayers to him that vouchsafed to be borne of thee for vs if any priuate person by meditation pearcing more profoundly into the mutuall loue and affection of such a son towards so worthie a mother doe deeme her prayers as forcible in kindnes as if they were commaundements and in that sense call them commaundements according to the french phrase vos priers me sont des commandements that may be done without derogation to christs supreame dignity and with high commendation of his tender affection vnto his reuerent and best beloued mother we do not pray to christ to pray for vs but we account ioh his loue to vs and his graciousnes with god his father to be such that whatsoeuer wee aske of god in his name by to the article par article h our owne prayers shall certainly be obtained as well as if all the saints in heauen should intreate him for vs and this is to make him our mediatour of intercession not simply as he is ma but as he is the ioh gal aduocate between god and man in which respect the rom heb scripture saith that he makes request to god for vs whatsoeuer was true and lawful before the arian heresie is so still there was as much reason why he should make her head of the church here on earth as that she should be queene of the church in heauen or queene of heauen but whatsoeuer she may be once a mediatrix she may not be for that is christs office now in heauen those hyperbolicall speeches of the ancients shew their zeale but maintaine not your error if those words roga patrem iube natum iure matris impera command in the right of a mother be not in any part of your roman seruice yet these speeches are in one that is no meane man bonauentur in psalte beat mariae psalm incline the countenance of god toward vs compell him to haue mercie vpon sinners and why may she not compell if as you terme her she be idemin corona mariae imperatur empresse and ladie of the world if she be psalt psalm the finder out of grace if she constrained the vncreated word to take flesh of her because she was a most humble ladis but will you haue the very word of commanding coro mari imperatr o our empresse and ladie most bountifull by the right of a mother commaund thy most beloued son that he vouchsafe to lift vp our mindes to heauenly desires from the loue of earthly things what doctrine is this and for what churches seruice was not bonauenture the author of all these speeches in opuse scrip opuse a cardinall of your roman church your seraphicall doctor and which is most of all is he not canonizatio bonauenturae in opuse a saint canonized by your pope that cannot erre is not the virgin mary in your horae beat maryae ad vsum sarisbur ecclesiastes fol seruice called the promise of the prephets the queene of the patriarkes the schoolmistris of the euangelists the teacher of the apostles the comforter of the quick and the dead who th saios deuoutly this short prayer daily saith the rubrick shall not depart out of this world without penance and ministration of the holy sacrament fol in another prayer in the same booke shee is called mag stra euangelistarum veracissima doctrix apostolorum sapien issima the most true schoolmistris of the euangelists the most wise teacher of the apostles the booke was printed at paris by francis regnault what profound piercing into such naturall affection can exccuse these speeches what french phrase can warrant it but what should we striue about the forciblenes of her prayers when it is not nor can be prooued that she prayes at all therefore we haue good cause to blesse the name of god that hath freed vs from the yoke of this roman bondage and hath brought vs to the true light and libertie of the gospell and it should be a great height of vnthankfulnesse in vs not to stand ouer against the present church of rome but to yeelde ourselues to plots of reconciliation to this effect and purpose i haue penned this little treatise which i present to your worship desiring it might be some token of a thankfull minde for vndeserued loue and i craue withall not onely your worshipfull which is more common but also your learned protection being well assured that by skill and arte you are able to iustifie whatsoeuer i haue truelie taught thus wishing to you and yours the continuance and the increase of faith and good conscience i take my leaue wherefore to conclude this epistle if there be no waightier cause then this by you here produced vvhy you and your adherent doe not reconcile your selues vnto the church of rome you may shortly by god grace become nevv man for vve are so farre off from making our sauiour christ a pseudoch st or from dravving one iote of excellencie from his souera gne povver merits or dignitie that vve in the very points by you put downe doe much more magnifie him then you doe for in maintaining the authority by him imparted vnto his deputies our spirituall magistrates and of their merits and satisfaction we first say that these his servant prer be his hee gifts of grace bestovved on vvhom he pleaseth vvhich is no finall praise of his great liberality and vvithall affirme that there is an infinite difference betvveene his ov ne povver merits and satisfaction and ours wherein his soueraigne honour is preserued entire to himselfe vvithout any comparison novv you make christs authoritie so base his merits and satisfaction so meane that if he part any degree of them vnto his servant he looseth the honour of all from himselfe whereupon it follow eth inuinciblie if you vnfeignedly seeke christ iesus his true honour and vvill esteeme of his diuine giftes vvorthelie you must hold out no longer but vn te your selfe in these necessarie heades of religion vnto the catholike church of rome which so highly exalted him both in his owne excellencie and in his singular giftes to his subiects the least of these is cause sufficient to withhold vs from ioyning with the church of rome at least in that point the kings authoritie is not abased because he cannot communicate any of his royalties to his subiects that christ must needes lose by it i shewed before for it argues an insufficiencie in his satisfaction by a reformed catholike i vnderstand any one that holds the same necessarie heades of religion with the roman church yet so as he pares off and reiects all errours in doctrine whereby the said religion is corrupted how this may be done i haue begun to make some little declaration in this small treatise the intent whereof is to shew how neere we may come to the present church of rome in sundrie points of religion and wherein we must for euer dissent my purpose in penning this small discourse is threefold the first is to confute all such politikes as hold and maintaine that our religion amp that of the roman church differ not in substance and consequently that they may be reconciled yet my meaning is not here to condemne any pacification that tends to perswade the roman church to our religion the second is that the papists which thinke so basely of our religion may be won to a better liking of it when they shall see how neere we come vnto them in sundrie points the third that the common protestant might in some part see amp conceiue the point of difference betweene vs and the church of rome and know in what manner and how farre forth we condemne the opinions of the said church i craue pardon for the order which i vse in handling the seuer all points for i haue set them downe one by one as they came to minde not respecting the lawes of method if any papist shall say that i haue not alleadged their opinions aright i answere that their bookes be at hand and i can iustifie what i haue said thus crauing thine acceptation for this my paines and wishing vnto thee the increase of knowledge and loue of pure and sound religion i take my leaue and make an ende vpon your preface to the reader i will not stand because it toucheth no point of controuersie let it be declared in your next what you meane when you desire your reformed catholike to hold the same necessarie heades of religion with the romane church for if the romane church doth erre in the matter of faith and iustification in the number and vertue of the sacraments in the bookes and interpretation of the word of god if she raze the foundation and make christ a pseudochrist and an idoll to omitte twenty other e rors in substantial points of faith as in this your small discourse you would perswade there will remaine verie few necessarie heades of religion for them to agree in and be you well assured that you are so wide from winning catholikes by this your worke to a better liking of your religion that you haue taken the high way to lead them to a farre greater dislike of it by teaching that in so many materiall points it differeth so farre from theirs for all catholikes hold for most assured that which the most auncient learned and holie doctor athanasius in his creede deliuereth in the verse vvhich catholike faith vnlesse euery man obserue wholy and inuiolably not omitting or shrinking from any one article of it vvithout doubt he shall perish euerlastingly if s basil that reuerent and blessed father of the church doth hold it the dutie of euerie good christian rather to loose his life then to condescend to the alteration of any one syllable in matter of faith you may be sure that we catholikes cannot but carrie a verie base conceipt of your doctrine who goe about vnder the ouerworne and thredbare cloake of reformation to deface and corrupt the purer and greater part of christian religion especially when they shall perceiue the most points of your pretended reformation to be nothing else but olde rotten condemned heresies new scoured vp and furbushed and so in shew made more saleable vnto the vnskilfull as in this treatise shall be proued in euery chapter there are many necessarie heads of saluation wherein we and you agree the trinitie redemption by christ against all iewes and heathen the godhead of christ against arius the vnitie of his person against nestorius the truth of his manhood though by consequence you ouerthrow it against eutyches the godhead of the holy ghost against macedonius and many other which i alleage not to make any papist beleeue that the differences between vs and you are few or small but to shew that master perkins speakes not against reason we are perswaded that no man may shrinke from the truth of that which is deliuered in athanasius creede though we dare not peremptorily condemne euery man that hath not a distinct knowledge and beleefe of euery one of the seuerall articles we are wholy of i asils iudgement that euery one ought rather to lose his life than to suffer any one syllable of god truth in the scripture to be betrayed and therefore wee forbeare to ioyne with the church of antichrist which preferres a corrupt translation before the text it selfe the learned know it to be a fault to make that the entrie vnto our discourse which may as properly fit him that pleadeth against vs but to vse that for our proeme which in true sence hath nothing for vs nay rather beareth stronglie for our aduersarie must needs argue great want of iudgement such is the sentence aboue cited out of s john by m perkins for it being trulie vnderstood is so farre off from terrifying any one from the catholike romane church as it doth vehementlie exhort all to fire vnto it by forsaking their wicked company that are banded against it if it fall out as i make no question but it will doe that the place chosen by master perkins be prooued to belong to the church of rome where is the fault then in the former chapter s john sets downe a description of the whore of babylon and that at large as he saw her in a vision described vnto him in the sixteenth verse of the same chapter he foretels her destruction and in the three first verses of this chapter he goeth on to propound the sayd destruction yet more directly and plainely withall alleadging arguments to prooue the same in all the verses following now in this fourth verse is set downe a caueat seruing to forewarne all the people of god that they may escape the iudgement shall befall the whore and the wordes containe two parts a commaundement and a reason the commaundement come out of her my people that is from babylon the reason taken from the euent least ye be partakers ampc touching the commaundement first i will search the right meaning of it and then set down the vse thereof and doctrine flowing thence in historie therefore are three babylons mentioned one is babylon of assyria standing on the river euphrates where was the confusion of languages and where the iewes were in captinitie which babylon is in scripture reproched for idolatry and other iniquities the second babilon is in egypt standing on the river nilus and is now called cayr of that mention is made pet v as some thinke though indeede it is as likely and more commonly thought that there is meant babylon of assyria the third babylon is mystical whereof babylon of assyria was a tipe and figure and that is rome which is without question here to be vnderstood and the whore of babylon as by all circumstances may be gathered is the state or regiment of a people that are the inhabitant of rome and appertaine thereto this may be prooued by the interpretation of the holy ghost for in the last verse of the chapter the woman that is the whore of babylon is said to be a citie which raigneth ouer the kings of the earth now in the daies when s john penned this booke of reuelation there was no citie in the world that ruled ouer the kings of the earth but rome it then being the seate where the emperour put in execution his imperiall authoritie againe in the seuenth verse shee is said to sit on a beast hauing seuen heads and tenne hornes which seuen heads bee seuen hils verse whereon the woman sitteth and also they bee seuen kings therefore by the whore of babylon is meant a citie standing on seuen hills now it is wel known not onely to learned man in the church of god but euen to the heathen themselues that rome alone is the citie built on seuen distinct hills called caelius auentinus exquilinus tarpeius or capitolinus viminalis palatinus quirinalis papists to helpe themselues doe alleadge that old rome stood on seuen hills but now is remooued further to the plaine of campus martins i answer that howsoeuer the greatest part of the citie in regard of habitation bee not now on seuen hils yet in regard of regiment and practise of religion it is for euen to this day vpon these hilles are seated certaine churches and monasteries and other like places where the papall authoritie is put in execution and thus rome being put for a state and regiment euen at this day it stands vpon hils and though it be come to passe that the harlot in regard of her latter dayes eue changed her seate yet in respect of her younger times in which she was bred and borne she sate vpon the hills others because they feare the wounding of their own heads labour to frame these words to another meaning amp say that by the whore is meant the company of all wicked man in the world whersoeuer the diuell being the head thereof but this exposition is flat against the text for she is opposed to the kings of the earth with whom she is said to commit fornication and in the last verse she is called a citie standing on seuen hils and raigning ouer the kings of the earth as i haue said and therefore must needs be a state of man in some particular place for by the purple harlot in that place is signified as shall be proued presentlie the romane empire as then it was the slaue of idols and with most bloodie slaughter persecuting christs saints those of the church of rome being as nearest vnto it so most subiect to that sacrilegious boucherie wherefore that voice which s john heard say goe out of her my people that you be not partakers of her sinnes ampc can haue none other meaning then that all they who desire to be god people must separate themselues in faith and manners from them who hate and persecute the romane church as did then the heathen emperours and now doe all heretikes vnlesse they will be partakers of their sinnes and consequentlie of their plagues this shall yet appeare more plainelie in the examination of this chapter where i will deale friendly with my aduersarie and aduantage him all tha i can that all being giuen him which is any way probable it may appeare more euidentlie how little he hath to any purpose out of this place of the apocalypse whereof all protestant vaunt and bragge so much both in their bookes and pulpits well then i will admitte that in the and chapters of the revelation by the whoore of babylon is vnderstood the romane state and regiment which in lawful disputations they are not able to proue the most iudicious doctor s augustine and diverse others of the auncient fathers with the learned troupe of later interpreters expounding it of the whole corps and societie of the wicked and as for the h ll s on the which they lay their foundation they are not to be taken literallie the angell of god in the verie text it selfe interpreting the heads of the beast to be aswell kings as hilles but this notwithstanding to helpe you forvvaid i vvill graunt it you because some good vvriters haue so taken it and therefore omitte as imperrinent that vvhich you say in proofe of it what can you inferre hereupon many that the romane church is that vvhoore of babylon fayre and soft good sir hovv proue you that thus the vvhoore of babylon is a state of the romane regment ergo the romane church is the vvhoore of babylon what some of arguing call you me this by the like sophistication you may proue that rom s and r s vvere the purple harlot vvhich to affinne vvere ridiculous or vvhich is impious that the most christian empe and codosius vvere the vvh ore of babilon because thes held also the state of the romane empire and regiment to make short the seeble force of this reason lyeth in this that they vvho ho eth the state and gouerne in the same kingdome must needs be of like affection in religion vvhich if it vvere necessarie then did queene mary of blessed memorie and her sister e zabeth same nundes tovvards the true catholike ath because they in the same chane of estate and ruled in the same kingdome see i pray you vvhat a shamefull cau this is to rase such a simple logician vvould blush to argue in the par s so loose and yet they that take vpon them to controule the learnedst in the vvorld often fall into such open tallacies we desire no fauour of you but that you would acknowledge the truth when you cannot reasonably gainsay it what we can prooue you shall see by and by in the meane while your reason is naught for what though s austin and diverse other ancient writers with the learned troupe of your popish interpreters doe so expound it doth it follow thereupon that in lawful disputation the contrarie cannot be proued could not they erre may not some other man see that which they perceiued not but what if wee shall match you in number and antiquitie of writers for our exposition first hieron an hierome as you acknowledge afterward makes for vs and not for you so by your confession doth tertul contra lud o pag amp contra mark ion lib pag tertullian but what name i seuerall man the a etas in apocrypha cap greeke scholiast tels vs that diverse interpreters by the harlot vnderstood old rome and he that so thinks in his iudgement erres not though saith he it may be vnderstood of new rome or the time of antichrists comming yes august de ci lib cap lib c austin himselfe grants that rome in greeke and latin writers is as it were a second babylon and he calles it babylon of the west more then that your baptista regnault in ber amp r be a in epistola ad lector owne writers deny those ho milies on the apocalyps to be au tins and think them rather to be written by ty conius the donatist which ribera the iesuite saies certis argumentis deprehendi eas tyconij esse non augustini he hath found by certaine arguments and euident reasons besides babtist regnaul vbi supra baptista regnald affirmes that the commenta ies of diners of the ancients bede ambrose aus ert anselme prunasius and austin are mysticall and allegoricall not historicall so that wee are not to rest vpon any of them for the true and proper meaning of the text it shewes more discretion than plaine dealing to omit that which you cannot answere master perkins reasons are euident and strong see doctor dovvnam of antichrist lib cap ss amp master povvel de antichristo lib cap ss the citie that in s iohns daies raigned ouer the kings of the earth is the whore of babylon apocrypha but rome that is ciuitas the state of rome ciuitas the state of rome and rome onely is that citie that raigned ouer the kings of the earth in s iohns daies therefore rome and rome onely is the whore of babylon the citie that in s iohns daies was seated on seuen hilles is the seate of the whore of babylon apocrypha but rome that is vibs the tovvn of rome vrbs the towne of rome is that only is the citie that in s iohns daies was seated on seuen hilles therefore rome and rome onely is the seate of the whore of babylon to the proposition of the latter reason you answere that see doctor fulk against rhem testam revelation and dovvn of ant c lib ss and r em test revelation the seuen hilles are not to be taken literally because the angell makes the seuen heads aswell seuen kings as seuen hilles but surely that rather makes against you for as the seuen kings are literally to be vnderstood so are the seuen hilles both being signified by the seuen heads not that the seuen hils are seuen kings for the woman or citie doth not sit vpon the kings but rather the kings vpon her besides it were a strange interpretation to expound heads by hilles and hils by kings whereas heads doe more resemble kings than hilles doe and the papists themselues perceiuing that this shift will not serue their turne make two romes heathenish rome and that whereof the pope is head now say they the whore spoken of is heathenish rome which was ruled by cruell tyrants as nero domitian and the rest and that rome wherof now the pope is head is not here meant behold a vaine and foolish distinction for ecclesiasticall rome in respect of state princely dominion and cruelty in persecuting the saints of god is all one with the heathenish empire the see of the bishop being turned into the emperours court as all history doe manifest well then admitting the purpel harlot to signifie the roman state wee doe say that the state of rome must bee taken as it was then when these words were spoken of it that is pagan idolatrous and a hot persecutor of christians such it had beene a little before vnder that bloodie tyrant nero and then was vnder domitian which we confirme by the authoritie of them who expound this passage of the roman state the commentary on the apocalyps vnder saint ambrose name sayth the great where sometime doth signifie rome specially vvhich at that time vvhen the apostle vvrote this did persecute the church of god but othervvise doth signifie the whole citie of the diuell and saint ierome who applieth the place to rome affirmeth that she had before his dayes blotted out that blasphemie vvritten in her forhead because then the state was christian which before had beene heathen so that vnto the partie pagan and not vnto the church of god he ascribeth these works of the wicked harlot which also the very text it selfe doth conuince for it hath that she vvas drunke vvith the blood of the mart rs of iesus now the church of rome hath not then by the confession of all man drawne any blood of christs saints but in testimonie of his trueth had powred out abundance of her best blood wherefore it is most manifest that the harlot could not signifie the church of rome so pure and free from slaughter but the romane empire vvhich vvas then full gorged vvith that most innocent and holy blood againe that vvhoore is expounded to be a citie vvhich had kingdome ouer the kings of the earth but the church of rome had then no kingdome ouer the earth or any temporall dominion at all but the romane emperours had such soueraigne commaundement ouer many kings vvherefore it must be vnderstood of them and not of the church novv to take kingdome not properly for temporall soueraignty but for spirituall i isdiction as some shifters doe is to she vvithout any vvarrant from the natiue signification of the vvord vnto phantasticall and voluntarie imagination and vvhereas m perkins saith that ecclesiasticall rome in respect of state princely dominion and cruelty against the saints is all one vvith the heath sh empire he both seeketh to deceiue and is greatly deceiued he vvould deceiue in that he doth applie vvords spoken of rome aboue yeares agoe vnto rome as it is at this day and yet if that were granted him he erreth fo e in euery one of his particulars for first touching princ e dominion the romane empire held then all italy all fraunce all spayne all england a great part of germany of asia and also of afrike hauing their proconsulles and other principall officers in all those country drawing an hundred thousand millions in money and many other commodity out of them wherefore in princely dominion and magnificall state it surmounted ecclesiasticall rome which hath not temporall dominion ouer the one halfe of that one kingdome of italy more then an hundred degrees and as for persecution the empire slew and caused to be slaine more saints of god in one yeare then the church of rome hath done of reprobates and obstinate heretikes in yeares hauing thus proued that the whoore of babilon signifieth the heathen state of rome and not the ecclesiasticall let vs now heare what you say against it marry that the distinction of the empire of rome and church of rome is foolish and coyned of late to serue our turne which to be farre otherwise i proue out of those verie authors who doe interpret that harlot to signifie rome who are neither foolish nor of late daies you haue heard it before out of s ambrose commentaries and farther we gather it out of s hierome in the epistle which you cite for he hauing resembled rome vnto babilon for the multitude of the wicked which yet remained in it pointeth out a more pure part saying there is in deede the holy church there are the triumphant monuments of the apostles and martyrs there is the true confession of christ there is the faith praised by the apostle ampc be not there expressed two distinct parts of rome againe tertullian who liued in the second hundred yeare vnder those persecuting emperours saith in one place that babilon is a figure of rome in respect of her proud empire and persecution of the saints and in an other that rome was most happie for her holy church vnto vvhich the apostles vvith their blood had poured forth their vvhole doctrine see a plaine distinction betweene the heathen empire and the holie church of rome which finallie may be gathered out of the expresse word of god vvhere the church in babilon coelect is distinguished from the rest of that citie which was pagan you say but without any authour that babilon there doth not signifie rome but either a citie in egypt or assyria but eusebins lib history c and s jerome de ecclesiastes script verse marcus with other authors more worthie of credit doe expound it of rome and you your selues take babilon so rome where you thinke that any hold may be taken against it as in the of the revelation but in s peters epistle they will none of it because it would proue too plainely that s peter had been at rome master perkins hauing prooued that by babylon rome is signified proceedes to answere two obiections first see fulke rhem testam revelation and dovvnam of antichrist lib cap that the citie of rome stands not now vpon seuen hils but it did in s iohns daies as his reason lies and at this day popish churches or monasteries are situated vpon them vnder the popes authoritie secondly that by the whore the company of the wicked vnder their head the diuell is vnderstood revelation amp but this the text will not beare the whore being opposed to the kings of the earth and ruling ouer them vpon this foundation master perkins thus builds his reason either rome heathenish or rome christian is the whore of babylon but rome heathenish is not therefore rome christian is this is plainly his reason and not that which you gather the proposition is euident because the state of rome was neuer but either heathenish or christian the assumption master perkins proues but i must be faine to leaue his course and to follow this reformers steps the state of rome must be taken as it is the see fulke dovvnam abbot povvel seate of antichrist but it was not the seate of antichrist in s iohns daies for antichrist bellarm de romano pon if lib cap according to your doctrine is not yet come againe it was no mysterie for heathenish rome to be an idolatrous and bloody persecutor of the christians thirdly the state that s john calles the harlot continues till the finall destruction spoken of by him and s paul but the estate of heathenish rome was decayed long since your proofe is insufficient for you alleage but two of many that make rome babylon who as they deserue commendation for discerning so much of the truth so may they bee excused if seeing rome in their time a christian famous church they did not take it to be the seate of antichrist but hierome seemes rather to make against you because euen then he calles it babylon in respect of antichrist to come your second and third reasons are of no more force for s john as i haue shewed spake not of rome as it was then but as it was to be afterward and now hath been almost one thousand yeeres euen in temporall authoritie to which one of the popes swords belongs master perkins rightly applies to rome the words that fifteene hundred yeeres since were spoken of her as she is now the popes legates were nothing inferiour either for authoritie or exactions to the romane proconsuls but as it was foretold in a mysterie vnder a colour of spirituall gouernment ouerruling both in ecclesiasticall and ciuill matters he that remembers the bloodie massacre of so many thousands in a few daies not many yeeres agoe in france shall see that the church of rome shed blood enough at that one time to make her drunke as long as she shal continue amp yet what a small part was it of that which from time to time she hath bezeled in this section is nothing to purpose for who denies that there were as well christians as heathen in rome in the emperours daies the distinction master perkins denies is that s john speakes of rome as it was vnder the emperours and not of it as it hath been and is vnder the popes which the authors you alleage meddle not with s john writ a prophecie and therefore might well vse allegories besides he describes his babylon so plaine that rhem test revelation bellarm de pon roma lib cap your selues are forced to confesse he meanes rome by it s peter deales as an apostle not as a prophet and no where giues any inckling that by babylon rome should be meant eusebius sets it not downe as his owne opinion but only recites it out of papias from whom also it is apparant that h rome had it and in whom euseb history lib cap eusebius saith there were many fabulous matters but let the distinction be as they suppose yet by their leaues hereby the whore must be vnderstood not onely heathenish rome but euen the papal or ecclesiasticall rome for the holy ghost saith plainly that she hath made all nation drunke with the wine of the wrath of her fornication yes it is added that she hath committed fornication with the kings of the earth wherby is signified that she hath indeauoured to intangle all the nation of the earth in her spirituall idolatry and to bring the kings of the earth to her religion which thing cannot be vnderstood of the heathenish rome for that left all the kings of the earth to their owne religion and idolatry neither did they labour to bring foreign kings to worshippe their god againe it is said that the ten hornes which be ten kings shall hate the wh re and make her des late and naked which must not be vnderstood of heathenish rome but of popish rome for whereas in former times all the kings of the earth did submitte themselues to the whore now they haue begun to withdraw themselues and make her desolate as the king of bohemia denmarke germany england scotland and other parts therefore this distinction is also friuolous they further alledge that the whore of babylon is drunke with the blood of the saints and martyrs shed not in rome but in ierusalem where the lord was crucified and the two prophets being slaine lie there in the streets but this place is not meant of hierusalem as hierome hath fully taught but it may well be vnderstood of rome christ was crucified there either because the authority whereby he was crucified was from the romane empire or else because christ in his members was and is there daily crucified though locally in his owne person he was crucified at ierusalem and thus notwithstanding all which hath bin said wee must here by the whore vnderstand the state of the empire of rome not so much vnder the heathen emperors as vnder the head thereof the pope well m perkins is content in fine to allowe of that distinction of heathenish and ecclesiasticall rome which before he esteemed o foolish and then will prooue that not the heathenish but ecclesi st ca is resembled to the purpell harlot see what confidence this man hath in his owne shutle wit that now will prooue this and shortly after disproue it but let vs giue him the hearing the holy ghost sayth plainely that she hath made all the vvorld drunke v th the vvine of the vv ath of her fornication and yet addeth that she hath committed fornication vvith the kings of the earth but this cannot be vnderstood of heathenish rome for that left all the kingdomes of the earth vnto their owne religion and idolatry and did not labour to bring them to worship the roman god ergo it must be vnderstood of papall r me i answere the roman empire being the head and principall promoter of all kinde of idolatry and maintaining and aduancing them that most vehemently opposed themselues against the christian religion who with any shew of reason can denie but they chiefly comitted spirituall fornication with the kings of the earth if not by persvvading them to forsake their false god vvhich the pagan romans vvorship asvvell as they yet by encourage and commanding them to perseuere in that filthie idolatry and to resist and oppresse the christians vvheresoeuer neither is that true that the roman emperours did not labour to bring other nation to vvorship nevv god vvhen nero and domitian would be worshipped as god and for feare of adrian one antinous his servant was worshipped as a god of all man as iustinus martyr testifieth these words of the text then agree very well with the emperours who both were idolaters and the chiefe patrons of idolatry but can in no sort be applied to the romane church which was th n as the protestant cannot deny a pure virgin and most free from all spirituall fornication but that it is now become idolatrous m perkins doth proue by his second reason gathered also i warrant you right learnedly out of the text it selfe where it is said that the ten hornes which signifie ten kings shall hate the whore and make her desolate and naked which as he saith must be vnderstood of popish rome for whereas in former times all the kings of the earth did submitte themselues to the whore now they haue begunne to withdraw themselues and to make her desolate as the kings of bohemia denmarke germany england scotland and other parts in these his words is committed a most foule fault by grosse ouersight and ignorance in the very text what be england scotland denmarke as for bohemia ruled by a catholike emperour it must be omitted as also many states of germany be these kingdomes your principall pillers of the new gospell comprehended within the number of the ten mentioned there in s john which hate the harlot yes marie why then they are enemy of christ and satans souldiers for in the verse it is said of these that they shall deliuer their power vnto the beast which signifieth either the diuell or antichrist and shall sight with the lambe and the lambe shall ouercome them because he is lord of lord and king of kings is not this doating in an high degree to infame so notoriouslie them of whom he would speake most honour and to make the special patrons of their new gospel the diuels captaines and fiercely to wage battaile against christ iesus see how heate of wrangling blindeth mens iudgements but you proceed and say that we further hold that the blood of the saints and martyrs was not shed in rome but in ierusalem here is a confusion of man and matters for we say that the blood of many saints reheaised in the apocrypha was shed in rome by the tyrannicall emperours but the martyring of those tvvo principall witnesses enoch and elijah recorded in the cleauenth of the same shall be at ierusalem aswell because the text is very plainc for it specifying that their body shall lie in the streetes of that great citie where their lord was crucified as for that the ordinarie interpreters of that place doe so take it but m perkins holdeth that the place where christ was crucified signifieth here not ierusalem but rome because christ was crucified there in his members so it might aswell signifie any other place of persecution as rome the reason therefore being naught worth befort fiath it with the name of s ierome but citeth in the margent a letter of two vertuous matrons paula and eustochium good sir if s reme had meant that that epistle should haue had his authoritie he would haue set it out in his owne name vvhich seeing he thought not expedient set the authoritie of it aside and vige his reasons i you thinke it vvorth your labour and you shall be ansvvered in the meane season i hope all sober christians vvill take the place vvhere our sauiour christ vvas nailed on the crosse to signifie rather ierusalem then rome and consequently all that you haue alleadged out of scripture to proue the vvhore of babylon to figure the ecclesiasticall state of rome not to be vvorth a rush to make the world drunke with the wine of the wrath of her fornication is not to inforce man by file and sword as the roman emperors did but to allure them by poysoned doctrine and counterfeite holines which course hath been almost proper to the church of rome the like signification hath the other speech of committing fornication with the kings of the earth which argueth a delight whereby they were drawne not a violence of inforcement yes the idolatry the apostle speakes of is not the grosse worshipping of salse god by profest idolatry but in a mysterie the false worshipping of the true god against his reason you except not but charge him with doting in a high degree for making the kings of england scotland ampc satans souldiers and such in deed they were revelation when they gaue their power to the beast and as long as they continued the popes servant but the apostle shewes that revelation at the last after their drunkennes and fornication the lord hauing discouered their shame vnto them they should hate the whore ampc which they haue happily done yes euen bohemia though a popish emperour for this present gouerns it and shall in god good time wholy consume her flesh with fire it is neither diuinity nor reason to imagine that henoch and eltas hauing been taken from the earth by god to their reward should come againe into the world and be slaine by antichrist as vntrue is it that by that great city revelation amp amp ierusalem is meant for that terme is neuer giuen to it in all the reuelation but to rome ordinarily especially revelation chap amp chapters yes our sauiour himselfe was not crucified leuit heb in ierusalem but without it in the great city that is in the romane empire he was indeed crucified yet is he also daily crucified in his members by the instigation and appointment of the pope of rome by whom all the later persecutions of true christians haue been raised in seuerall country howsoeuer the secular power hath been the instrument of his crueltie m perkins brings not onely hieroms name but his iudgment that epistle being of erasmus in carol oper eronyn ludo ues ad aug e ciuit de cap rhem revelation his writing in the name of those two matrons yet we stand nor vpon his authoritie though we might well inough against you and your ordinarie interpreters without name but vpon the reasons before deliuered which proue that the great city is not ierusalem but rome which exposition besides the authoritie of the text hath the sauour and defence of auncient and learned man bernard saith they are the ministers of christ but they serue antichrist againe the beast spoken of in the apocalyps to which a mouth is giuen to speake blasphemies and to make war with the saints of god is now gotten into peters chaire as a lyon prepared to his pray it will be said that bernard spake these latter wordes of one that came to the popedome by intrusion or vsurpation it is true indeed but wherefore was he an vsurper he rendreth a reason thereof in the same place because the antipope called innocentius was chosen by the kings of almaine france england scotland spaine hierusalem with consent of the whole clergie and people in these nation and the other was not and thus bernard hath giuen his verdict that not only this vsurper but all the popes for this many yeeres are the beast in the apocalyps because now they are onely chosen by the colledge of cardinals to this agreeth the decree of pope nicholas the second ann that the pope shall afterward be created by the suffrages of the cardinall bishops of rome with the consent of the rest of the clergie and people and the emperor himselfe and all popes are excommunicate and accursed as antichrists that enter otherwise as all now doe ioachimus abbas saith antichrist was long since borne in rome and shall be yet aduanced higher in the apostolike see petrarch saith once rome now babylon and ireneus booke chap last said before all these that antichrist should be lateinus a romane novv let vs come to the auncient and learned man vvhom you cite in fauour of your exposition the first is s bernard vvho saith that they are the ministers of christ but they serue antichrist of vvhom speaketh that good religious father forsooth of some officers of the court of rome good vvho vvere as he saith the ministers of christ because they vvere lavvfully called by the pope to their places but serued antichrist for that they behaued themselues corruptly in their callings and so this maketh more against you then for you approouing the lavvfull officers of rome to be christs ministers the second pla e is alleadged out of him yet more impertinently your selfe confessing presently that those vvords vvere not spoken of the pope but of his enemy the reason yet there set dovvne pleaseth you exceedingly vvhich you vouch so clearely that it seemeth to beare flat against you for you inferre that the pope and all others since that time be vsurpers out of this reason of s b nard because forsooth that the antipope called innocentius vvas chosen by the king of almaine france england ampc and their vvhole clergie and people for if fnnocentius vvere an antichrist and vsurper because he vvas elected by so many kings and people then belike he that had no such election but is chosen by the cardinals of rome onely is true pope this your vvords declare but your meaning as i take it is quite contrary but of this matter and manner of election shall be treated hereafter if need require it sufficieth for this present that you finde no reliefe at all in s bernard touching the maine point that either the pope or church of rome is antichrist and all the world might meruaile if out of so sweet a doctor and so obedient vnto the pope any such poison might be sucked specially weighing wel what he hath written vnto one of them to whom he speaketh thus goe to let vs yet enquire more diligently who thou article and what person thou bearest in the church of god during the time vvho article thou a great priest the highest bishop thou article the prince of bishops the heire of the apostles and in dignitie aaron in authoritie moses in povver peter thou article he to vvhom the keyes were deliuered to vvhom the sheepe vvere committed there are indeede also other porters of heauen and pastors of flockes but thou article so much the more glorious as thou hast inherited a more excellent name aboue them they haue their flockes allotted to them to each man one but to thee all were committed as one flocke to one man thou article not onely pastor of the sheepe but of all other pastors thou alone article the pastor and much more to this purpose which being his cleere opinion of the pope how absurd is it out of certaine blind places and broken sentences of his to gather that he thought the pope of rome to be neither sheepe nor pastor of christs church but very antichrist himselfe there is a grosse fault also in the canon of pope nicolas as he citeth it that the pope was to be created by the cardinals bishops of rome as though there were some or bishops at once but of the matter of election else where m perkins hauing lightly skirmished with a broken sentence or two out of one catholike authour flieth to a late here ke called ioachim and quoteth iewell for relator of it a worshipfull testimony of one heretike and that vpon the report of an other and he the most lying authour of these daies as for the late poet petrarke his words might easilie be answered but because he quoteth no place i will not stand to answere it but to close vp this first combat a sentence is set downe out of the famous martyr ireneus that antichrist should be lateinos a roman here be as many faults as words that learned auncient doctor discoursing of antichrist his proper name out of these words of the revelation the number of the beast is and obseruing the letters of the greeke alphabet by which they doe number as wee doe by ciphers saith that among others the word lateinos doth containe those letters which amount iust to the number of and consequently that antichrists proper name perhaps might be lateinos but more likely it is to be teitan as he saith there amp lastly that it is most vncertaine what his name shall be see the place gentle reader and learne to beware of such deceitefull merchant as make no conscience to corrupt the best authours and being often warned of it will neuer learne to amend jreneus leaueth it most doubtfull what shall be antichrists name and among diverse words esteemeth lateinos to be the vnlikeliest and yet m perkins reporteth him to say resolutely that his name shall be lateinos and then to make vp the matter turneth lateinos a proper name with s ireneus into romane an appellatiue which noteth onely his country fie vpon that cause which cannot be vpholden and maintained but by a number of such paltrie shirtes thus come we at length to the end of m perkins proofes and reproofes in his prologue where we finding litle fidelitie in his allegations of the fathers badde construction and foule ouersight in the text of holy scripture briefely great malice but slender force against the church of rome we are to returne the words of his theame to all good christians goe out of her my people forsake the enemy of the romane church and as our ancestors did the pagan emperours who drew out her most pure blood so let vs file in matters of faith and religion from all heretakes that of late also spared not to shedde abundance of the same most innocent blood vnlesse to your greater condemnation you had leifer be partakers of her sinnes and receiue of her plagues bernar sermon in cantic they were the ministers of christ by their profession as the pope calls himselfe the servant of servant though both he is in truth antichrist and they his ministers m perkins reason out of bernard lyeth thus he that gets into peters chaire without the consent of the princes clergie and people of christendom is the beast spoken of in the apocalypse but all the popes from that schisme hitherto haue so gotten into peters chaire viz with consent of the cardinals onely therefore all the popes since that schisme are the beast in the apocalypse the proposition is bernards in effect though notin words for indeede bernard makes them both a tichrists he pronounces the pope to be the beast in the reuelation because he was not chosen by consent of the princes clergie and people of almaine france england ampc and this master perkins sets downe very plaine at these words and thus bernard ampc how wide then are you from his meaning who make the quite contrarie collection in his name for if innocentius say you were antichrist and an vsurper because he was chosen by so many kings and people then belike he that had no such election but is chisen by the cardinals of rome onely is true pope he concludes out of bernard that he was antichrist because he was not chosen by the kings clergie and people but onely by the cardinals you that he was true pope because he was not chosen by the kings and but onely by the cardinals the reason out of bernard you answere not but shift off the matter with alleaging a sentence of his in commendation of pope eugenius which is so full of flatterie that i say not impietie that it can carrie no credit with any modest christian it should seeme you saw so much your selfe and therefore craftily left out these absurd and vile speeches viz bernard de consider ad eugenium li prima ab gubernatione noe patriarcha u abraham ordine melc c iudica u samuel vnctione christus thou article abel in primacie noah in gouernment in patriarkship abraham in order melchisedech in authoritie of iudging samuel in vnction that is either in annoynting or in being annoynted christ if this be not a blinde sentence on bernards part and a broken sentence on yours there is nothing but may abide the light be it neuer so false and be accounted whole be it neuer so mangled it is rather grosse ignorance in you to finde fault with that you vnderstand not master perkins neither saith nor meanes that there were many bishops of rome at once and yet there haue been three popes together but according to the dist in nomine canon cals the cardinals bishops of rome referring this word of rome not to bishops simply but to cardinall bishops now all cardinals were cardinals of rome or of the roman church the canon indeede puts not in those words of rome but the sense is nothing altered by the adding of them for the cleere vnderstanding of the matter we are to know that all cardinals are either cardinall bishops whom the canon appoints inprimis cardinales episcopate diligen sime simul de electione tractantes first to consult about electing of the pope or cardinall clerkes that is of some inferiour order of the clergie the general name wherof is clerke whether it be priesthood deaconship ampc and these mox clericos christi cardinales adhibeant sicque reliquus clerus amp populus ad consensum nouae electionis accedant must in the second place be called to the election now let man iudge whether master perkins or you are in fault this canon is brought to prooue the former proposition that he is no lawful pope who is chosen only by the cardinals and not also by the consent of the rest of the clergie and people if you had been as carefull to auoide slandering as that reuerend and learned writer was to take heede of vntruths you would neuer haue raised such a suspition of him in this point for the cleering of him let his owne desence against master hardings reproches speake for the present set out by the vvorthie and learned sir henry sauile roger houeden bal de script anglic cent cap who liued in that time records the historie and sets houeden annal poster in richard primo downe ioachims words to king richard that antichrist was alreadie borne in the citie of rome and that he should be exalted into the apostolike seate but you except against ioachim as an heretike so doth not bellarm append de sumnio pontif cap bellarmine but onely denies that he writ any such thing it is true that concil lateran sub innocent the councell of lateran vnder pope innocent the third condemned a certaine booke that abbat ioachim writ against peter lombard bishop of paris commonly called the master of the sentences concerning the vnitie or essence of the trinitie but it did not reiect him as an heretike yes the councell specially addes that they will not by their sentence any way derogate from the abbey of florence whereof he was the institutor orderer as well because the orders in it were good as also for that he had submitted all his writings to the apostolike see therefore coccius in thesauro catholico iodocus coccius makes him one of his latin doctors out of whom he confirmes your popish doctrine and trithemius de scriptor ecclesiastes trithemius saith that he was a man studious and exercised in the scriptures and that he writ many things against the iewes and other aduersaries of the catholike faith petrark one of the lights of his age for learning wrote about yeeres since that petrarc son gia roma hor babylonia falla e ria rome was become babylon and not onely babylon but false and wicked babylon further in the same place he calles her the fountaine of griefe the lodge of wrath the schoole of error the temple of heresie a shamelesse strumpet which hauing been founded in chastitie humilitie and pouertie hath lifted vp her hornes against her founders the emperours sonet in another place he calles her couetous babylon that hath filled vp the measure of god wrath with impious and wicked vices so that it runnes ouer sonet in a third he termes her impious babylon from whom all shame is fled the lodge of griefe and mother of errors in whom there is no goodnes i set not down all he speakes against her somewhat i haue touched that i might see how easily you will answere his words but i thinke he that hath read bellarm de roman pont append cap bellarmine of this point may gesse before hand what you can say in the matter irenae lib cap irenaeus as you truly say determines not what shall be antichrists name and leanes more to than to yet neither doth he allow of that because habet verisimilitudinem vt ex multis coll gamus ne forte teitan vocetur qui venier a man as hee saith may with likelihood gather by many things that his name perhaps shall not be and of he affirmes that it is valde verisimile est quoniam verissinum regnum hoc habet voca ulum very likely and giues his reason of it because the most true kingdome had that name master perkins expounded it not as a proper name but as an appellatiue because neither revelation the euangelist nor irenaeus doe intend to shew antichrists proper name but see d name of l b cap to make knowne the name of the beast which antichrist should make all take now the beast being the romane or latin state the name also must be sutable thereunto as wee see it is our papists calling themselues romane that is latin catholikes i will not fall into exhortation hereupon only i desire all man that haue care of their saluation to consider without preiudice whether it be not euident that the state of rome whereof the pope is head is the whore of babylon prophecied of by s john reuelat againe this commandement must not so much be vnderstood of a bodily departure in respect of cohabitation and presence as of a spirituall separation in respect of faith and religion and the meaning of the holy ghost is that man must depart from the roman church in regard of iudgement and doctrine in regard of their faith and the worship of god thus then we see that the words containe a commaundement from god inioyning his church and people to make a separation from babylon whence i obserue that all those who will bee saued must depart and separate themselues from the faith and religion of this present church of rome and whereas they are charged with schisme that separate on this manner the truth is they are not schismatiks that doe so because they haue the commandement of god for their warrant and that partie is the schismatike in whom the cause of this separation lieth and that is in the church of rome namely the cup of abomination in the whores hand which is their heretical and schismaticall religion and because i purpose god willing not only to confute what m perkins bringeth against the catholike doctrine but some what also in euerie chapter to fortifie and confirme it i will here deliuer what some of the most auncient most learned and most holy fathers doe teach concerning ioyning with the church and pope of rome from whose societie protestant labour tooth and nayle to withdraw vs and because of this we must treate more amply in the question of supremacie i will vse here their authoritie only whom m perkins citeth against vs s bernard is cited already s ireneus scholler of s polycarpe and he of s john the euangelist of the church of rome writeth thus to this church by reason of her more mightie principalitie it is necessary that euery church that is the saithfull on all sides to condescend and agree in and by which alwaies the tradition of the aposiles hath been preserued of them that be round about her saint jerome writing to damasus pope of rome saith i following none as chiefest but christ doe in participation ioyne with thy blessednesse that is with the chayre of peter i know the church to be builded vpon that rocke vvhosoeuer doth eate the paschall lambe out of this house is a prophane fellovv he that is not found vvithin the arke of noe shall when

belong not to christ but be of antichrists traine see hovv flat contrarie this most holy ancient father is to m perkins m perkins vvould make vs of antichrists band because vve cleaue vnto the bishop of rome whereas saint hierome holdeth all to appertaine to antichrist who be not fast lincked in matters of religion with the pope and see of rome and so to conclude with this point euerie true catholike must say with saint ambrose i desire in all things to follovv the church of rome and thus much of his prologue it is a weake fortifying of popish doctrine to alleage a few sentences written one thousand or more yeeres since in approbation of the church of rome as it was then irenaeus hierome ambrose would haue all man ioyne with the church of rome which florished in their daies therefore no man may separate from it in these our daies who sees not the feeblenes of this consequence and yet this is all the force that can be in the reason till they haue prooued that the church of rome either was then or is not now the church of antichrist if that principalitie irenaeus speaks of were in the church of rome by any right of authoritie from god how should the same irenaeus be excused who iren lib cap reprooues victor b of rome for taking vpon him to excommunicate some of the easterne churches about obseruing of easter if it be in nicolas galas ad illum irenaei um respect of the truth which then florished at rome no doubt all man must cleaue vnto it as farre as it cleaues to the truth of god hieron ad damasum hierome a romane and at that time a yong man liuing in syria being pressed by an arian bishop to allow by subscription that which might tend to the countenancing of arianisme writes to damasus his owne bishop for his aduice in the matter but that he did not in respect of his place as if hee could not erre because he was bishop of rome for liberius the very next bishop before damasus by descriptor ecclesiastes in fortunatiano hieroms owne confession had subscribed to arianisme but in regard of his iudgement which was sound against that heresie so that whosoeuer in that question gathered not with him scattered and held with antichrist against christ those all things that ambros de sacra lib cap ambrose speaks of are according to the place alleaged by you to be restrained to the liturgie and ceremonies of the church of rome wherein though ambrose professe himselfe desirous to follow the church note by the way that the church of rome is taken gabriel biel in canon missae lect de quotidiana praefatione as a particular diocesan church such as the church of millan also was at that time and not as the vniuersall catholike church yet he did not so follow it because reason led him another way his words are these in all things i desire to follow the romane church but et nos homines ensum habemus yet we also being man haue vnderstanding therefore that which is otherwhere better obserued we also rightly keepe we follow the apostle peter himselfe we sticke vnto his deuotion ampc out of which speech of ambrose these points are to be obserued first that the vnderstanding of christian man is to direct them wherein they are to follow the church of rome wherein to leaue it secondly that some other churches might and did better obserue diverse things than the church of rome did thirdly that the church of rome did not obserue that which the apostle peter at least in ambrose his iudgement had deuoutly performed thus we see what helpe there is in the ancient writers to free the pope and church of rome that now are from being the very antichrist foretold of in the reuelation now touching the dutie of separation i meane to speake at large not standing so much to prooue the same because it is euident by the text as to shew the manner and measure of making this separation and therein i will handle two things first how far forth we may ioyne with them in the matter of religion secondly how far forth and wherein we must dissent and depart from them and for this cause i meane to make choice of certaine points of religion and to speake of them in as good order as i can shewing in each of them our consent and difference and the rather because some harpe much vpon this string that a vnion may be made of our two religions and that we differ not in substance but in points of circumstance afterward he taketh vpon him to prescribe and shew vs how far forth we may ioyne with the church of rome by proposing many points in controuersie betweene vs and them and in each shewing in what points we consent togither and in what we differ i meane by god grace to follow him step by step although he hath made many a disorderly one aswell to discouer his deceits and to disproue their errors as also to establish the catholike doctrine the which i will endeuour to performe by the helpe of god with all simplicitie of language and with as much breuity as such a weightie matter will permitte yet i hope with that perspicuitie as the meaner learned may vnderstand it and with such substance of proofe both out of the holy scriptures and auncient fathers as the more iudicious to vvhose profit it is principallie dedicated may not contemne it i will labour as much as i can both for plainnes and shortnes in all the seuerall points not doubting but by the grace of god to maintaine master perkins reasons and answers against all your cauils the first point wherewith i meane to begin shall be the point of freewill though it be not the principall freewill both by them and vs is taken for a mixt power in the mind and will of man whereby discerning what is good and what is euill hee doth accordingly chuse or refuse the same that i be not thought captious but willing to admit any thing that m perkins hath said agreeable to the truth i will let his whole text in places indifferent passe paring off only superfluous words with adding some annotations where it shall be needfull and rest onely vpon the points in controuersie first then concerning free will wherewith he beginneth thus he saith free vvill both by them and vs ampc annot if we would speake formally it is not a mixt power in the mind and will that master perkins vvas not ignorant of this it appeares in his treatise of god free grace and mans free will pag but is a free facultie of the mind and will only whereby we choose or refuse supposing in the vnderstanding a knowledge of the same before but let this definition passe as more populer your correcting of master perkins definition passeth my vnderstanding for if it be a a facultie both of the minde and will out of doubt it is a mixt facultie but it is more strange that you adde only of the minde onely or of the will onely are speeches that haue some reason in them but of the minde and will onely is a phrase implying a contradiction vnlesse there be some third part of the soule vnknown to ordinarie philosophers whereof free will may be suspected to be a facultie i conclus man must bee considered in a fourefold estate as he was created as he was corrupted as he is renewed as he shall be glorified in the first estate we ascribe to mans will libertie of nature in which he could will or nill either good or euill in the third liberty of grace in the last liberty of glory annot carry this in mind that here he granteth man in the state of grace to haue free will all the doubt is of the second estate and yet therein also we agree as the conclusions following will declare ii conclus the matters whereabout freewill is occupied are principally the actions of man which bee of three sorts naturall humane spirituall naturall actions are such as are common to man with beast as to eate drinke sleepe heare see smell taste and to mooue from place to place in all which we ioyne with the papists and hold that man hath free will and euen since the fall of adam by a naturall power of the minde doth freely performe any of these actions or the like iii conclus humane actions are such as are common to all man good and bad as to speake and vse reason the practise of all mechanicall and liberall arts and the outward performance of ciuill and ecclesiasticall duties as to come to the church to speake and preach the word to reach out the hand to receiue the sacrament and to lend the eare to listen outwardly to that which is taught and hither we may referre the outward actions of ciuill vertues as namely iustice temperance gentlenesse liberalitie and in these also wee ioyne with the church of rome and say as experience teacheth that man haue a naturall freedome of will to put them or not to put them in execution paul saith rom the gentiles that haue not the lawe doe the things of the law by nature that is by naturall strength and hee saith of himselfe that before his conuersion touching the righteousnesse of the law he was vnblameable philipp and for this externall obedience natural man receiue reward in temporall things matth ezech and yet here some caueats must be remembred i that in humane actions he should haue said morall saith d b p mans will is weake and feeble and his vnderstanding dimme and darke and thereupon he often failes in them this caueat is no caueat of the protestant but taken out of s thomas of aquine saith d b p and in all such actions with augustine you might haue quoted the place aith d b p i vnderstand the will of man to be onely wounded or halfe dead see m p of god free grace and mans free vvill pag humane is more generall and more fit because morall cannot comprehend the first ranke of actions in the beginning of the section besides it may be master perkins thought it not fit to giue that title to any actions of naturall man because none of them are performed according to the arist ethic lib cap amp philosophers definition of morall vertue by a habit with due obseruation of the circumstances required by him howsoeuer they are magnified by you papists the caueat is not taken out thomas q article amp of those places wherein thomas shewes no more but that a man cannot by his naturall strength either fulfill the law or auoide sinne the place is quoted edition in the margin hypognostic lib which you shal finde in tome of austins works though indeed the book be thought to be none of austins ii that the will of man is vnder the will of god and therefore to be ordered by it as ieremie saith chap verse o lord i know that the way of man is not in himselfe neither is in man to walke or direct his steps who knowes not this saith d b p if there be no man that knowes it not perhaps euery man remembers it not and it is a caueat necessarie for this question the iere prophet in the place brought by master perkins so speakes of it to god as if it were not knowne to all man o lord i know that the way of man ampc and to say the truth how can any man bee said to know it bo ius de consol ph losoph lib pro amp thomas bi that fetches the knowledge which god hath of things depending on mans will from the sight of the things from all eternitie present to him for the thing must needs be in the order of nature at least before it can be knowne to be but of this point when iust occasion shall be offered about predestination iv conclus the third kinde of actions are spirituall more neerely concerning the heart and conscience and these be twofold they either concerne the kingdome of darknes or else the kingdome of god those that concerne the kingdome of darknesse are sinnes properly and in these we likewise ioyne with the papists and teach that in sinnes or euill actions man hath freedome of will some paraduenture will say that wee sinne necessarily because hee that sinneth cannot but sinne and that free will and necessitie cannot stand together indeed the necessitie of compulsion or coaction and freewill cannot agree but there is another kinde of necessitie which may stand with freedome of will for some things may be done necessarily and also freely a man that is in close prison must needs there abide and cannot possibly get forth and walke where he will yet can he mooue himselfe freely and walke within the prison so likewise though mans will be chained naturally by the bonds of sinne and therefore cannot but sinne and thereupon sinneth necessarily yet doth it also sinne feely annot the example of a close prisoner is not to the purpose for it puts necessitie in one thing and liberty in an other the solution is that necessarily must be taken for certainly not that a man is at any time compelled to sinne but his weakenes and the crafte of the diuell are such that he is very often ouer reached by the diuell and induced to sinne but with free consent of his owne will the example is to the purpose as he that is in prison if he will walke must of necessitie walke in the prison and yet walkes freely there because he may chuse whether he will walke or no so he that is chained by sinne may chuse whether hee will doe such an action or no but if hee doe it he shall necessarily sinne in doing of it and thus necessitie and libertie are alike in both parts of the similitude there is nothing in your solution that was not in master perkins distinction saue that you haue put it in other words you say certainly he infallibly you say man sinnes with free consent and is not compelled he saies he sinnes freely and not of compulsion v conclus the second kind of spirituall actions or things concerne the kingdome of god as repentance saith the conuersion of a sinner new obedience and such like in which we likewise in part ioyne with the church of rome and say that in the first conuersion of a sinner mans free will concurs with god grace as a fellow or co worker in some fort for in the conuersion of a sinner three things are required the word god spirit and mans will for mans will is not passiue in all and euery respect but hath an action in the first conuersion and change of the soule when any man is conuerted this worke of god is not done by compulsion but he is conuerted willi gly and at the very time when he is conuerted by god grace he wills his conuersion to this end said augustine he which made thee without thee will not saue thee without thee againe that is certaine that our will is required in this that we may doe any good thing well but we haue it not from our owne power but god works to will in vs for looke at what time god giues grace at the same time he posse velle amp a velle recipere giueth a will to des e and will the same grace as for example when god works faith at the same time he works also vpon the will causing it to desire faith and willingly to receiue the gift of beleeuing god makes of the vnwilling will a willing will because no man can receiue grace vtterly against his will considering will constrained is no will but here we must remember that howsoeuer in respect of time the working of grace by god spirit and the willing of it in man goe together yet in regard of order grace is first wrought and mans will must first of all be acted and moued by grace and then it also acteth willeth and moueth it selfe and this is the last point of consent betweene vs and the romane church touching free will neither may we proceede further with them now before i come to the supposed difference i gather first that he yeeldeth vnto the principall point in controuersie that is freedome of will in ciuill and morall workes in the state of corruption and all good workes in the state of grace for in his first conclusion distinguishing foure estates of man he affirmeth that in the third of man renued or as we speake iustified there is liberty of grace that is grace enableth mans will to do if it please such spiritual works as god requireth at his hands yet lest he be taken to yeeld in any thing he doth in shew of words contradict both these points in another place for in setting downe the disference of our opinions hee saith that mans will in his conuersion is not actiue but passiue which is flat opposite vnto that which himselfe said a litle before in his first conclusion that in the conuersion of a sinner mans will concurreth not passiuely but is co worker with god grace the like contradiction may be obserued in the other part of libertie in morall actions for in his third conclusion he deliuereth plainelie man to haue a naturall freedome euen since the fall of adam to doe or not to do the acts of wisedome ius ce temperance ampc and proues out of s paul that the gentiles so did yet in his first reason he assirmeth as peremptorily out of the of genisis that the whole frame of mans heart is corrupted and all that he thinketh deuiseth or imagineth is wholy euill leauing him no natural strength to performe any part of morall duty it is neither the principall point in controuersie nor any controuersie at all according to master perkins whether man haue freedome of will in morall workes before grace and in all good workes after grace for of the former master perkins makes no question but onely conclus caueat giues a caueat of the feeblenes of the will and dimnes of the vnderstanding in such matters with the latter he deales not at all professedly restraining the question to conclus in the end our dissent about the second estate libertie in the state of grace to will spirituall good wee thankfully acknowledge but neither is it of rom so large extent as your exposition makes it and philipp without the speciall worke of god spirit by it selfe it brings no good thing to passe he doth not say simply that mans will in his conuersion is not actiue but that in it selfe it is not actiue but passiue of which his other speech is not a contradiction but rather a confirmation that mans will concurres with god grace as a co worker in some sort and a little after mans will is not passiue in all and euery respect but hath an action in the first conuersion of the soule now what action it hath and in what respect it is actiue and passiue he shewes presently after the words are falsely alleadged by you viz that it wils well onely as it moued by grace being in it selfe neither actiue nor passiue this latter contradiction is indeede like the former that is no contradiction at all for hee doth rightly expound gen that place of a pronenes to that which is as ill and to nothing that is fully good not simply excluding that which is ciuilly good but that onely which is properly referred to god himselfe the soueraigne good and the other in regard of it perfect goodnes the point of difference standeth in the cause of the freedome of mans wil in spiritual matters which concerne the kingdome of god the papists say mans will concurreth and worketh with god grace in the first conuersion of a sinner by it selfe and by it owne naturall power and is onely helped by the holy chost we say that mans will worketh with grace in the first conuersion yet not of it selfe but by grace or thus they say will hath a naturall cooperation we denie it and say it hath cooperation onely by grace beeing in it selfe not actiue but pas willing well onely as it is mooued by grace whereby it must first be acted and mooued before it can act or will and that wee may the better conceiue the difference i will vse this comparison the church of rome sets forth the estate of a sinner by the condition of a prisoner and so doe wee marke then the difference it supposeth the said prisoner to lie bound hand and foote with chaines and fetters and withall to bee sicke and weake yet not wholy dead but liuing in part it supposeth also that beeing in this case he stirreth not himselfe for any helpe and yet hath ability and power to stirre hereupon if the keeper come and take away his bolts and fetters and hold him by the hand and helpe him vp hee can and will of himselfe stand and walke and goe out of prison euen so say they is a sinner bound hand and foote with the chaine of his sinnes and yet he is not dead but sick like to the wounded man in the way betweene iericho and ierusalem and therefore doth he not wil and affect that which is good but if the holy ghost come and doe but vntie his bands and reach him his hand of grace then can he stand of himselfe and will his owne saluation or any thing else that is good we in like manner graunt that a prisoner fitly resembleth a naturall man but yet such a prisoner must he be as is not only sicke amp weake but euen starke dead which cannot stirre though the keeper vntie his bolts and chaines nor heare though he sound a trumpet in his eare and if the said keeper would haue him to moue and stirre he must giue him not onely his hand to helpe him but euen soule and life also and such a one is euery man by nature not onely chained and fettered in his sinnes but starke dead therein as one that lieth rotting in the graue not hauing any ability or power to moue or stirre and therefore he cannot so much as desire or doe any thing that is truelie good of himselfe but god must first come and put a new soule into him euen the spirit of grace to quicken and reuiue him and then being thus reuiued the will beginneth to will good things at the very same time whe god by his spirit first infuseth grace and this is the true difference betweene vs and the church of rome in this point of free will see how vncertaine the steppes be of man that walke in darkenes or that would seeme to communicate with the workes of darknes for if i mistake him not he agreeth fully in this matter of free will with the doctrine of the catholike church for he putting downe the point of difference saith that it standeth in the cause of the freedome of mans will in spirituall matters allowing then freedome of will with vs in the state of grace whereof he there treateth for he seemeth to dissent from vs only in the cause of that freedome and as he differeth from luther and caluin with other sectaries in graunting this liberty of will so in the very cause also he accordeth with catholikes as appeareth by his owne words for saith he papists say mans will concurreth with god grace by it selfe and by it owne naturall power we say that mans vvill worketh with grace yet not of it selfe but by grace either he vnderstandeth not what catholikes say or else accuseth them wrongfully for we say that mans will then only concurreth with god grace vvhen it is stirred and holpen first by god grace so that mans vvill by his ovvne naturall action doth concurre in euery good worke otherwise it were no action of man but we farther say that this action proceedeth principally of grace whereby the will was made able to produce such actions for of it selfe it was vtterly vnable to bring forth such spirituall fruit and th i take to be that which m perkins doth meane by those his words that the will must be first moued and acted by grace before it can acte or will he mistook thinking that we required some outward helpe only to the will to ioyne with it or rather that grace did but a it were vntie the chaynes of sin wherein our will was eted an t en will could of it selfe turne to god no vnderstanding how catholikes take that parable of the man wounded in the way betweene ierusalem and ierico who was not as the papists only say but as the holy ghost aith le te halfe and not starke dead now the exposition of catholikes is not that this wounded man which signifieth all mankind had halfe his spirituall strength left him but was robbed of all supernaturall riches spoiled of all his originall iustice and wounded in his naturall powers of both vnderstanding and will and therein left halfe dead not being able of his owne strength either to know all natural truth or to performe all morall duty novv touching supernaturall vvorkes because he lost all povver to performe them not being able so much as to prepare himselfe conueniently to them he in a good sense may be likened vnto a dead man not able to moue one finger that vvay of grace and so in holy scripture the father said of his prodigall son he was dead and is reuiued yet as the same son liued a naturall life albeit in a deadly sinne so mans will after the fall of adam continued somewhat free in actions conformable to the nature of man though vvounded also in them as not being able to acte many of them yet hauing still that naturall facultie of free vvill capable of grace and also able being first both outvvardly moued and fortified invvardly by the vertue of grace to affect and do any vvorke appertaining to saluation vvhich is asmuch as m perkins affirmeth you vtterly mistake the matter he speakes not of will in the state of grace but in the state of nature namely in the first conuersion of a sinner as his plaine words are in this place the difference stands in the cause of freedome for it is impossible that a man should beleeue without freedom of will beleeuing being an action of the will but the question is whether the will work with god grace by it selfe by it owne naturall power or haue this operation from grace being in it selfe not actiue but passiue and this is the very opinion of luther caluin and generally all protestant diuines who in this point thus dissent from you that they ascribe the very act of the will in repenting beleeuing ampc to the especiall worke of god spirit in their hearts that repent and beleeue whereas you contrariwise hauing furnisht man with freedome of will by nature or i know not what grace make his assent for i must speake of faith as you doe to proceede not from the spirit of god inclining him certainly to beleeue but from the good vse of his free will yeelding of it selfe to the good motion of god spirit yet so as that it might for all the motion and operation of god spirit forbeare to assent if it were not led to it by the goodnes of free will in a word you ascribe no more to god but the power that the will hath to will that which is good wee acknowledge that the very act of willing well both before and after grace is caused by the spirit of god to and in euery good desire that wee bring well to passe it is more than master perkins affirmes that the will being outwardly moued and inwardly fortified with the vertue of grace is able to effect and doe any worke appertaining to saluation for this vertue is not of such strength but that it needes the particular assistance of god spirit to incline and frame it to euery good worke of that nature and this to be the very doctrine of the church of rome is most manifestly to be seene in the councell of trent vvhere in the sixt session are first these vvords in effect concerning the vnablenesse of man to arise from sinne of himselfe euery man must acknowledge and confesse that by adams fall we were made so vncleane and sinfull that neither the gentiles by the force of nature nor the ievves by the letter of moses lavv could arise out of that sinfull state after it shevveth hovv our deliuerance is vvrought and hovv freedome of v ill is recouered in special and vvherin it consisteth saying the beginning of iustification in persons vsing reason is taken from the grace of god preuenting vs through jesus christ that is from his vocation vvhereby vvithout any desert of ours vve are called that vve vvho vvere by our sinnes turned avvay from god may be prepared by his grace both raising vs vp and helping vs to returne to our ovvne justification freely yeelding our consent vnto the said grace and vvorking vvith it so as god touching the hart of man by the light of the holy ghost neither doth man nothing at all receiuing that inspiration vvho might also refuse it neither yet can he vvithout the grace of god by his free vvill moue himselfe to that vvhich is iust in god sight and that you may be assured that this doctrine of the councell is no other then that vvhich vvas taught three hundred yeares before in the very middest of darknes as heretikes deeme see vvhat saint thomas of aquine one of her principall pillers hath vvritten of this point in his most learned summe where vpon these vvords of our sauiour no man can come to me vnlesse my father dravv him he concludeth it to be manifest that man cannot so much as prepare himselfe to receiue the light of grace but by the free and vndeserued helpe of god moouing him inwar ly therevnto sell cap the councill of trent as closely as it carries matters could not but bewray it selfe in this point wherein it leaues to the will of man inlightened by the holie ghost inspirationem llam bi ce e potest the act of refusing and receiuing grace which must needs be naturall because there was no former worke of god whereby this power to receiue grace was bestowed vpon it and this doth q article ad hoc quod praepar e homo ad susceptionem h s dont non oportet nere aliquod aliud donum habituale in anima thomas by you alleaged make more plain denying that there is any grace in the will of man as from god for the preparing of himselfe to receiue habituall grace because then we should need another grace for the former and another for that before the former and so without end what then doth god in this case he moues the heart inwardly saith thomas or he breathes into vs a good purpose a man would thinke that thomas hereby acknowledged the receite of some speciall grace but it is not so he meanes no more but this that god puts a good motion into vs for the receiuing of habituall grace which it is in the power of our will by nature either to receiue or refuse so that still in the matter of iustification the reason that this man is iustified that is not shall be from man and not from god are they not in the middest of darknes that write such things now for the confirmation of the doctrine we hold namely that a man willeth not his owne conuersion of himselfe by nature either in whole or in part but by grace wholy and alone these reasons may be vsed the first is taken from the nature and measure of mans corruption which may be distinguished into two parts the first is the want of that originall righteousnes which was in man by creation the second is a pronenes and inclination to that which is euill and to nothing that is truly good this appeareth the frame of mans heart saith the lord is euill euen from his childhood that is the disposition of the vnderstanding will affections with all that the heart of man deuiseth frameth or imagineth is wholly euill and paul saith the wisdome of the flesh is enmity against god which words are very significant for the word translated wisdome signifieth that the best thoughts the best desires affections and indeauours that be in any naturall man euen those that come most neare to true holines are not only contrary to god but enmitie it selfe and hence i gather that the very hart it selfe that is the will and mind from whence these desires and thoughts doe come are also enmity vnto god for such as the action is such is the facultie whence it proceedeth such as the fruit is such is the tree such as the braunches are such are the rootes by both these places it is euident that in man there is not only a want absence or depriuation of originall righteousnes but a pronenes also by nature vnto that which is euill which pronenes includes in it an inclination not to some few but to all and euerie sin the very sinne against the holy ghost not excepted hence therefore i reason thus if euery man by nature doth both want originall iustice and be also prone vnto all euill then wanteth he naturall free will to will that which is truely good but euery man by nature wants originall iustice and is also prone vnto all euill ergo euery man naturallie wants free will to will that which is good reason ii corinthian the naturall man perceiueth not the things of the spirit of god for they are foolishnesse vnto him neither can know them because they are spiritually discerned in these words s paul sets downe these points i that a naturall man doth not so much as thinke of the things reuealed in the gospell ii that a man hearing and in mind conceiuing them cannot giue consent vnto them and by naturall iudgement approue of them but contrariwise thinketh them to be foolishnesse iii that no man can giue assent to the things of god vnlesse he be enlightened by the spirit of god and hence i reason thus if a man by nature doth not know and perceiue the things of god and when he shall kn w them cannot by nature giue assent vnto them then hath he no power to will them but the first is euidently true ergo for first the mind must approue and giue assent before the will can choose or will and when the mind hath not power to conceiue or giue assent there the will hath no power to will reason iii thirdly the holy ghost auoucheth ephesians coloss that all man by nature are dead in sinnes amp trespasses not as the papists say weak sicke or halfe dead hence i gather that man wanteth naturall power not to will simplie but freelie and frankly to wil that which is truely good a dead man in his graue cannot stirre the least finger because he wants the very power of life sense and motion no more can he that is dead in sinne will the least good nay if he could either will or doe any good he could not be dead in sinne and as a dead man in the graue cannot rise but by the power of god no more can he that is dead in sinne rise but by the power of god grace alone without any power of his owne reason iv fourthly in the conuersion and saluation of a sinner the scripture ascribeth all to god and nothing to mans free will john except a man be borne againe he cannot see the kingdome of god ephesian we are his workemanship created in christ iesus to good works and chap verse the new man is created to the image of god now to be borne again is a worke of no lesse importance then our first creation and therefore wholy to be ascribed to god as our creation is indeede paul philipp biddeth the philippians worke out their saluation with feare and trembling not meaning to ascribe vnto them a power of doing good by themselues and therefore in the next verse he addeth it is god that worketh both the will and the deede directly excluding all naturall free will in things spirituall and yet withall he acknowledgeth that mans will hath a worke in doing that which is good not by nature but by grace because when god giues man power to will good things then he can will them and when he giueth him a power to doe good then he can doe good and he doth it for though there be not in mans conuersion a naturall cooperation of his will with god spirit yet is there a supernaturall cooperation by grace enabling man when he is to be conuerted to will his conuersion according to which s paul saith corinthian i haue laboured in the faith but least any man should imagine that this was done by any naturall power therefore he addeth yet not i that is not by any thing in me but god grace in mee inabling my will to doe the good i doe reason v the iudgement of the auncient church august de corrept amp grat c august the will of the regenerate is kindled onely by the holy ghost that they may therefore bee able because they will thus and they will thus because god workes in them to will and epistle wee haue lost our freewill to loue god by the greatnesse of our sinne sermon on the wordes of the apostle man when hee was created receiued great strength in his free will but by sinning he lost it fulg lib fulgentius god giueth grace freely to the vnworthy whereby the wicked man beeing iustified is inlightened with the gift of good will and with a facultie of doing good that by mercy

arausic cap to beleeue and to will is giuen from aboue by infusion and inspiration of the holy ghost more testimonies and reasons might bee alleaged to prooue this conclusion but these shall suffice now let vs see what reasons are alleaged to the contrarie and this is all vvhich m perkins in his pretended dissent auerreth here and goeth about to proue in his fiue reasons follovving the vvhich i vvill omitte as being all for vs and if any man desire to see more to that purpose let him read the most learned vvorkes of that famous cardinall and right reuerend archbishop bellarmine you should at the least haue propounded his reasons that all man might haue seene whether they make for you or against you but you tooke a wiser course for your own credit yet giue me leaue to shew that his conclusions are directly against you he that hath naturally free will to receiue a good motion inspired by god hath naturally free will to will that which is good for to receiue such a motion is to will that which is good but euery man according to q article thomas and concil trident sess cap the councill of trent hath naturally free will to receiue a good motion inspiried by god for else he cannot receiue any or must haue some habituall grace to prepare him for the receiuing of it therefore euery man hath naturally free will to will that which is good this is your conclusion to which his are contrarie viz euery man naturally wants free will to will that which is good secondly man by nature hath no power to will the things of god thirdly man naturally haue no power to will the least good fourthly man cannot naturally will his owne conuersion the testimonies alleaged need neither confirmation nor explication bellarmines disputation shall be examined if it please god to giue leisure and opportunitie novv the very point controuersed concerning free vvill m perkins hath quite omitted vvhich consisteth in these tvvo points expressed in the councell first vvhether vve doe freely assent vnto the said grace vvhen it is offered vs that is vvhether it lie in our povver to refuse it and secondly vvhen vve concurre and vvorke vvith it vvhether vve could if vve listed refuse to vvorke vvith it in both vvhich points vve hold the affirmatiue part and most sectaries of this time the negatiue of vvhich our authour is silent only by the vvay in his fourth reason toucheth tvvo texts out of s paul vvhich are commonly alleaged against free vvill the fir i haue saith he laboured more abundantly then all they yet not i but the grace of god vvhich is in me attributing the vvhole vvorke to grace to vvhich i briefely ansvvere that they doe corrupt the text to make it seeme more currant for them the greeke hath only he sun emoi vvhich is vvith me not vvhich is in me so that the vvord in true construction makes much more for vs then against vs saint paul affirmeth the grace of god vvhich vvas vvorking vvith him to haue done these things and so saint augustine vvhom they pretend to follovv most in this matter expoundeth it yet not i but the grace of god vvith me that is not i alone but the grace of god with me and by this neither the grace of god alone neither he alone but the grace of god vvith him thus saint augustine the like sentence is in the booke of wisdome send that vvisdome from thy holy heauen that it may be vvith me and labour vvith me master perkins tooke that as the most principall point which doth most diminish the glorie of god the end of all true religion see article part article now what opinion is more derogatorie to god glorie than that which giues mans will a power by nature to receiue grace ofered vpon an inward motion of god without any inclini g of the will by him and this answers your former quesion denying that it lies in our owne power to refuse gra e though we freely assent vnto it there is a necessity of in llibilitie so that it cannot come to passe that a man inclin d by god spirit should not receiue grace there is notwthstanding a freedome of will because the will is not compelled to assent the second question is like the former and answered in like sort viz that we might refuse in re ect of the nature of our will which is not forced to the choise that in the euent we cannot refuse because god frames our will ineuitably to make that choise you saw it was not for you to deale with master perkins reasons as they were set downe by him for then it would haue been looked for that yo should haue answered directly to all the places of scrip ure hee brings against the strength of fr will by nature therefore you shift off the matter and outof nine texts alleaged in this question you chuse onely th e against which you thinke you are able to say somewh and what is it you say that master perkins attributes he whole to grace vtterly vntrue for hee saith plainly corinthian at there is a supernaturall cooperation of mans will with god s rit by grace enabling him to will his conuersion and addes fterwards not i that is i by any thing in me but god grace e enabling my will to doe that good i do hieron contra ouin lib if that translation rrupt the text hierome corrupted it not we and to say e truth it is all one to vs whether you reade in me or wh me so you acknowledge the strength whereby the apole workes to be of god and not of nature but for the prase the grace of god in the scripture signifies either the loue and fauour of god which is wholy without a man or some gift of his which is a qualitie in the soule now it is a great deale more likely that the apostle speakes of some gift of god within him whereby hee is made able to labour than of the fauour of god without him wherby his labour is blessed we subscribe to august de grat amp lib arb cap s austin that in all our good workes we have a part or rather that the worke it selfe is wholieours though both the grace whereby we are enabled to do it and the inclination whereby we are brought to doe i proceede from the spirit of god the second text is it is god that woreth in vs both to vvill and to accomplish we graunt that it is god bu ot he alone without vs for in the next words before saint paul saith worke your saluation vvith feare and trembling so that god worketh pincipally by stirring vs vp by his grace and also helping forward our wil to accomplish the worke but so sweetly and con ormablie to our naure that his working taketh not away but helpeth forward our will toconcurre with him againe the whole may be attributed vnto god considering that the habits of grace infused be from him as sole efficient cause of them our actions indued also with grace being onely disposi ons and no efficient cause of those habits but this is an high point of choole diuinitie very true but not easily to be conceiued of the vnlea ed we also grant as i haue said that it is god with vs herein wee differ that you ascribe no more to god in our first conuersion but a stirring of vs vp and helpng forward of our will leauing the euent to our choise an so vncertaine we affirme that god doth so work that he clines the will so that the euent shall in fallibly ensue ther on the whole may not be attributed to god though the habits of grace infused be from him as a sole efficient case of them for the question is not how we come by these abits but whether the actions done when we haue the hbits be ours or no speaking of good workes after iustifi tion if the question be of our first conuersion we say t act of beleeuing is ours but the grace by which we are eabled to beleeue is giuen by god and made effectual made to produce this effect of beleeuing by god also one other obiection may be collected ou of perkins third reason against free will which is touched as he saith by the holy ghost in these words vvhen vve vvere dead in sinnes if a man by sinne become like a dead man he cannot concurre with god in his rising from sinne ansvvere sure it is that he cannot before god by his grace hath quickned and as it were reuiued him to which grace of god man giueth his free consent how can that be if he were then dead marry you must remember what hath been said before that albeit man in sinne be dead in the way of grace yet he liueth naturally and hath free will in naturall and ciuill actions which will of his being by grace fortified and as it were lifted vp vnto a higher degree of perfection can then concurre and worke with grace to faith and all good workes necessarie to life euerlasting as for example a crab tree ocke hath no ability of it selfe to bring forth apples and therefore may be tearmed dead in that kind of good fruit yet let a sian e of apples be ga ted into it and it wil be are apples euen so albeit our sower corrupt naure of it selfe be vnable to fructifie to life euerlasting yet hauing re iued into it the heauenlie graft of god grace it is inabled to produce he sweete fruit of good workes to which alludeth saint iames rece e the ingrafted vvord vvhich can saue our soules againe what more d d then the earth and yet it being tilled and sowed doth bring forth a beare goodly corne now the word and grace of god is compared by ur sauiour himselfe vnto seede and our harts vnto the earth that recei ed it what meruaile then if we otherwise dead yet reuiued by this liuelyeed do yeeld plentie of pleasing fruit the question is not whether god can ma e a man able to doe good workes or no for of that no mandoubts but what a man can doe by nature to his owne co ersion master perkins saith he is spiritually dead and there re can do nothing you answere that he can doe something when god hath quickened him but what can hee do to the quickening of himselfe giue his free consent you say then it must needes follow that he hath power by na e to will his owne conuersion for as yet hee hath receiued no grace but onely hath had a good motion made to him or inspired into him by god of which by his owne free wil he takes a liking and so attaines to iustifying grace hauing hitherto explicated the state of the question and solued such obiections as may be gathered out of master perkins against it before i come to his solution of our arguments i will set downe some principall places both out of the scriptures and auncient fathers in defence of our doctrine because he proposeth but few for vs and misapplieth them too god hath appointed to bring them to chuse and like of saluation christ vnto these of the old testament one vnder the law of nature and the er vnder moyses law let vs couple two more out of the new testament the first may be those kind words of our sauiour vnto the iewes jerusalem jerusalem ampc how often vvould i haue gathered together thy children as the hen doth her chick s vnder her vvings and thou vvouldest not which doth plainely demonstrate that there was no want either of god helpe inwardly or of christs perswasion outwardly for their conuersion and that the whole fault lay in their owne refusing and withstanding god grace as these words of christ doe plainely witnes and thou vvouldest not the last testimony is in the reuelat where it is said in the person of god i stand at the doore and knocke if any man shall heare my voice and open the gates i vvill enter in to him and vvill suppe vvith him and he vvith me marke well the words god by his grace knocks at the dore of our harts he doth not breake it open or in any sort force it but attendeth that by our assenting to his call we open him the gates and then lo he with his heauenly gifts will enter in otherwise he leaues vs what can be more euident in confirmation of the freedome of mans will in working with god grace matth we acknowledge that the fault is wholy in euery man that is not saued but wee denie that therefore he hath power by nature to chuse life when it is offered he failes indeede in doing of that which hee might doe and ought to doe for his owne furtherance to this choise as the iewes did in refusing to heare to meditate to yeeld to the miracles wrought by our sauiour christ and to beleeue the doctrine which they could in no reasonable sort gainsay it was perk of god free grace p lombard senten dist voluntas signi not beneplaciti god offered them the outward meanes of his word not the inward meanes of his spirit for their conuersion which act lydia had revelation to breake open the doore were to vse compulsion to perk of god free grace p knock is to vse the outward meanes of conuerting a man or if you will to inspire a good purpose vpon which if any man open out of doubt christ will enter but this doth no prooue that a man vpon this motion can yeeld by the strength of his owne free will which is the point in question to these expresse places taken out of god word let vs ioyne the testimony of those most auncient fathers against whose workes the protestant can take no exception the fi shall be that excellent learned martyr iustinus in his apologie who vnto the emperour aatonine speaketh thus vnlesse man by free vvill could she from soule dishonest deeds and follovv those that be faire and good he vvere vvithout fault as not being cause of such things as vvere done but vve christians teach that mankind by free choise and free vvill doth both doe vvell and sinne to him we will ioyne that h ly bishop and valiant martyr jreneus who of free will writeth thus not only in vvorkes but in faith also our lord reserued liberty and freedome of vvill vnto man saying be it done vnto thee according to thy faith i will adde to that worthie company saint cyprian who vpon those words of our sauiour vvill you also depart discourseth thus our lord did not bitterly in igh against them vvhich forsooke him but rather vsed these gentle speeches to his apostles vvill you also goe your vvay and vvhy so marry obseruing and keeping as this holy father declareth that decree by vvhich man left vnto his liberty and put vnto his free choise appetite des es or at the most procure not might deserue might deserue vnto himselfe either damnation or saluation these three most auncient and most skilfull in christian religion and so zealous of christian truth that they spent their blood in confirmation of it may suffice to certifie any indifferent reader what was the iudgement of the auncient and most pure church concerning this article of free wl specially when the learnedst of our aduersaries confesse all an quitie excepting only s augustine to haue beleeued and taught free will heare the words of one for all mathias illyricus in his large long lying historie hauing rehearsed touching free will the testimonies of iustine ireneus and others saith in like manner lement patriarch of alexandria doth euery vvhere teach free vvill that it may appeare say these lutherans not only the doctors of that age to haue been in such darknes but also that it did much encrease in the ages follovving see the wilfull blindnes of heresie illyricus confessing the best learned in the purest times of the church to haue taught free will yet had rather beleeue them to haue bin blindly led by the apostles and then best schollers who were their masters then to espy and amend his owne e ror these principall pillers of christs church were in darknes belike as protestant must needes say and that proud persian and most wicked heretike manes of vvhom the manichees are named vvho first denied free vvill began to broach the true light of the nevv gospell iustin apol ad anto number iustin speakes of naturall actions not of spirituall for these were vtterly vnknowne to the emperour being a heathen he speakes also perhaps against the imputation of fatall necessitie wherewith the christians were charged in those times irenae lib cap irenaeus giues a man that freedome which is contrarie to constraint god saith he made man free from the beginning ampc non coactum deo not constrained by god cyprian lib epistle cyprian speakes of vsing or not vsing the outward meanes such as following christ to heare the word of him whereof ioh the euangelist there entreates now that this is in mans power and that it is a meanes to procure saluation or damnation who denies but cyprian doth not say that it is in a mans power by nature to consent to god motion for his conuersion it cannot reasonably be denied that in the point of free will some of the ancient writers before austin sixtus senens lib in praefat tolle us in ioh amp rom maldonatus in ioh peter in rom number spake liker philosophers than diuines and gaue both occasion to pelagius of his error though they fauoured it not and also aduantage for the confirming of it as the place of the centur cap column centuries alleaged by you plainly prooues other of them also spake not so plaine as it was to be wished they had done so that aug de nat amp grat

them against pelagius and in the entrance to his defence is faine to lay this foundation that he holds himselfe free for yeelding to any writings of man whatsoeuer here i vvould make an end of citing authorities vvere it not that caluin saith that albeit all other auncient vvriters be against him yet s augustine as he vaunteth is clearely for him in this point but the poore man is fouly deceiued asvvell in this as in most other matters i vvill briefly proue and that out of those works which s augustine wrote after the pelagian heresie was a foote for in his others caluin acknowledgeth him to haue taught free vvill of our freedome in consenting to god grace he thus defineth to consent to god calling or not to consent lyeth in a mans ovvne vvill againe vvho doth not see euery man to come or not to come by free vvill but this free vvill may be alone if he doe not come but it cannot be but holpen if he doe come in another place that vve vvill doe vvell god vvill haue it to be his and ours

euill or good life nor doth attribute so much to it that it is vvorth any thing vvithout grace so according to this most worthy fathers iudgement the sound catholike faith doth not deny free will as the old manichees and our new gospellers do nor esteeme it without grace able to doe any thing toward saluation as the pelagians did and to conclude heare s augustines answere vnto them vvho say that he when he commendeth grace denyeth free will much lesse vvould i say that vvhich thou lyinglie dost affirme me to say free vvill to be denied if grace be commended or grace to be denied if free vvill be commended caluin doth not without cause affirme that austin is for him not onely in his writings after the pelagian heresie but in those before it also though in the former he aug ret act lib cap speak not so warily as in the latter yet his iudgement was all one aug de spirit amp lit cap austin saith no more but that assenting or dissenting when god calles is an action of mans will that the difference between man and man why one beleeues and another doth not proceedes from the diverse worke of god spirit not from the choise of the parties he speakes most plainly in the same place ipsum velle credere deus operatur in homine god workes in a man the very willing to beleeue and yet more nay if any man will draw vs to the searching of that depth cur illi ita suadeatur vt persuadeatur illi autem non why this man is so perswaded that hee yeelds he is not there are onely two things which i thinke good to answere rom amp o the depth of the riches and is there iniquitie with god let him whom this answere mislikes seeke for some that are more learned but let him take heede that he finde not some that are more presumptuous imagine then what austin thinkes of you papists who confidently affirme that the reason of this difference proceedes from the good vse of free will in the beleeuer not that you are more learned but that you are more presumptuous aug de gra christ cap if you had added the words that follow immediatly in austin you should haue needed no further answere free will if a man come to christ cannot be but holpen et sic adiutum ampc and so holpen that not onely he must know what is to be done but doe that he knowes and therefore when god teaches not by the letter of the law but by the spirit of grace he teaches so that a man doth not onely see by knowledge that which he hath learned but also desire it by willing and performe it by doing and by this diuine manner of teaching euen the will and worke it selfe not onely the naturall possibilitie of willing and working is holpen si enim sol posse nostrum ampc for if onely our power were helpt by this grace the lord would thus speake euery one that hath heard of the father and hath learned can come to me but he said not so but euery one which hath heard of my father and learned doth come to me to haue power to come pelagius venire posse in natura ponit ascribes to nature or as of late he hath begun to speake to grace what grace soeuer he meane by which as he saith our possibilitie is helped but to come is in will and worke it followes not that he which can come etiam veniat nisi id voluerit atque fecerit comes vnlesse he will and doe so but euery one that hath learned of the father not onely can come but comes i haue set downe these words of austin at large as well that it may appeare with what conscience this man cites the fathers as that s austins iudgement of this point may be fully knowne to all man there is great reason that wee should expound aug ad simplicia q lib such short sentences as this by such large discourses as the former but if we knew not that this place makes nothing against vs for we haue graunted already that to will is our worke but wee say further that god calling as his teaching in aug de grat chri cap that other place of austin works in vs not only to be able to will but to will indeede i aug in ioh tract say of this as of the former that it is not contrarie to our doctrine for we acknowledge that in our iustification and saluation after election we worke with god but not as i haue often answered by any naturall power of our free will nor by any choyse of our owne to which we are not inclined and brought by god spirit we say with aug epistle lib contra ulian cap s austin both in words and meaning that true religion neither denies free will either to a good or bad life nor giues so much to it that it should be of any force without grace and we adde that therefore your religion is false because it affirmes that the will of man can by nature assent to a good motion inspired so to commend free will is indeede to deny grace but to holde them both as i haue proued austin did out of these very places which you alleage for your opinion and as we doe going not an haires breadth from him in this question is to glorifie god mercie and confesse our owne weaknes which is the end of his loue to vs in the whole worke of our saluation obiect i first they alleadge that man by nature may doe that which is good and therefore will that which is good for none can doe that which hee neither willeth nor thinketh to doe but first wee must will and then doe now say they man can doe good by nature as giue almes speake the trueth doe iustice and practise other duties of ciuill vertue and therefore will that which is good i answer that a naturall man may doe good workes for the substance of the outwarde worke but not in regarde of the goodnesse of the manner these are two diverse things a man without supernaturall grace may giue almes doe iustice speake the truth ampc which bee good things considered in themselues as god hath commaunded them but he cannot doe them well to thinke good things and to doe good things are naturall workes but to thinke good things in a good manner and to doe them well so as god may accept the action done are workes of grace and therefore the good thing done by a naturall man is a sinne in respect of the doer because it failes both for his right beginning which is a pure heart good conscience and faith vnfained as also for his end which is the glory of god novv in fevv vvords i vvill passe ouer the obiections vvhich he frameth in our names but misapplieth them first obiection that man can doe good by nature as giue almes do iustice speake the truth ampc and therefore vvill them vvithout the helpe of grace this argument we vse to proue liberty of wil in ciuil and morall matters euen in the corrupted state of man and it doth demonstrate it and m perkins in his third conclusion doth he graunts no more there then he doth here graunt it an his answere here is farre from the purpose for albeit saith he touching the substance of the worke it be good yet it faileth both in the beginning because it proceeds not from a pure hart and a faith vnfeined and also in the end w ich is not the glory of god ansvvere it faileth neither in the one nor other for that almes may issue out of a true naturall compassion which is a sufficient good fountaine to make a worke morally good faith and grace do purge the hart and are necessarie onely for good and meritorious workes againe being done to relieue the poore mans necessity god his creator amp master is thereby glorified and so albeit the man thought not of god in particular yet god being the finall end of all good any good action of it selfe is directed tovvards him vvhen the man putteth no other contrarie end thereunto master perkins as any man may see grants a freedome of will in morall actions but denies those actions to be good in regard of the goodnes of the manner and afterward a man may giue almes ampc which are good things considered as they are commanded of god but hee cannot doe them wel that is so as god may accept of the action done if you will replie vpon m perkins you must proue that such workes of a naturall man will be accepted of god but that you cannot do prosper de vocat gentium lib cap sine cul u veri dei etiam quod virtus vi detur esse peccatum est aug in senten prosper cap omnis infidelium vita peccatum est for the person must be accepted before the worke hebr and without faith he cannot be accepted nor haue faith being a naturall man the summe of the answere is if it be not done as the law requires it is not a good worke if it be it is meritorious and so must be accepted of god obiect ii god hath commaunded all man to beleeue and repent therefore they haue naturall free will by vertue whereof beeing helped by the spirit of god they can beleeue and repent ans this reason is not good for by such commaundements god shewes not what man are able to doe but what they should doe and what they cannot doe againe the reason is not well framed it ought rather to bee thus because god giues man commaundement to repent and beleeue therefore they haue power to repent and beleeue either by nature or by grace and then we hold with them for when god in the gospel commandeth man to repent and to beleeue at the same time by his grace he inableth them both to will or desire to beleeue and repent as also actually to repent and beleeue obiect god hath commaunded all to beleeue and repent therefore they haue naturall free will by vertue whereof being helped by the spirit of god they can beleeue the force of the argument consisteth in this that god being a good lord will not commaund any man to doe that which he is no way able to doe ans m perkins ansvvereth in effect for his vvords be obscure that god commaundeth that vvhich we be not able to performe but that which we should doe then i hope he vvill admitte that he vvill enable vs by his grace to doe it or else hovv should vve doe it god surely doth not bind vs by commandement to any impossible thing he is no tyrant but telleth vs that his yoke is sweet and his burthen easie and s john vvitnesseth that his commaundements are not heauy he vvas farre off from thinking that god vvould tye any man by lavv to doe that which he was altogether vnable to performe this in the end m perkins himselfe approueth master perkins denies the consequence of the enthymem viz that therefore man haue free will to beleeue and repent because god commands them to beleeue and repent you to helpe the matter giue a reason of the consequence god being a good lord will not command any man to do that which he is no way able to do therefore since god commands man to beleeue and repent they haue free will to beleeue and repent here the consequence is worse than before for who sees not that there may be other meanes of beleeuing amp repenting namely inclining the wil by grace the antecedent also is false for god being a good lord may inioyne his servant that which he made him able to performe bernard d grat amp lib arb fol corruit de posse non peccare in non posse non peccare though by his owne fault he be now vnable obiect iii if man haue no free will to sinne or not to sinne then no man is to be punished for his sinnes because he finneth by a necessitie not to bee auoided answere the reason is not good for though man cannot but sinne yet is the fault in himselfe and therefore he is to be punished as a bankrupt is not therefore freed from his debtes because he is not able to pay them but the bils against him stand in force because the debt comes through his owne default obiect if man haue no free will to sinne or not to sin then no man is to be punished for his sinnes because he sinneth by a necessity not to be auoided he answereth that the reason is not good for though man cannot but sinne yet is the fault in himselfe and therefore is to be punished against which i say that this answere supposeth that which is false to wit that a man in sinne cannot choose but sinne for by the helpe of god who desireth all sinners conuersion and thereunto affordeth grace sufficient a sinner in a moment may call for grace and repent him and so choose whether he will sin or no and consequently hath free vvill to sin or not to sin and that example of a bankerupt is not to purpose for he cannot when he will satisfie his creditours who content not themselues vvith his repentance vvithout repay of their money as god doth here againe master perkins denies the consequence that therefore a man is not to be punished for sinning because he hath no free will to sinne or not to sinne the reason of his denial is that which i answered in the second obiection he may iustly be punished though he haue not free will not to sinne because it is by his owne fault that he hath it not you replie that the answere supposeth that which is false the answere doth not suppose it but as i haue shewed plainly denies the consequence how your conceit that euery man hath helpe of god so that he may repent and beleeue when he will can stand with austins iudgement before set downe let euery man that hath reason consider the example of the bankerupt is fully to the purpose for which master perkins brings it to shew that a man is not alwaies therfore to be borne with for not doing that which hee is inioyned because hee cannot doe it for when it is through his owne fault that hee cannot why should hee escape now concerning the force of this argument heare s augustines opinion in these wordes neither are we here to search obscure bookes to learne that no man is worthy of dispraise or punishment which doth not that vvhich he cannot doe for saith he doe not shepheards vpon the dovvnes sing these things doe not poets vpon the stages act them doe not the vnlearned in their assemblies and the learned in their libraries acknovvledge them doe not maisters in the schooles and prelats in the pulpits and finally all mankind throughout the vvhole vvorld confesse and teach this to wit that no man is to be punished because he did that which he could not choose but doe should he not then according to s augustines censure be hissed out of all honest company of man that denieth this so manifest a truth confessed by all mankind how grosse is this heresie that so hoodeth a man and hardneth him that be he learned yet he blusheth not to deny roundly that which is so euident in reason that euen naturall sense doth teach it vnto shepheards god of his infinite mercie deliuer vs from this straunge light of the new gospell saint austin disputing in that booke see my ansvvere about the manichees in the epistle dedicatorie against the manichees who hold that there were two soules in euery creature of two diverse substances the one good the other bad by which they are forced to doe good or euill as either of them could ouercome other refutes them by this reason among other that if man doe well or ill by constraint they were neither to be praised nor dispraised for it that he is thus to be vnderstood not onely the course of his disputation shewes but also the definition that he brings of will will saith de duabus animabus contra manic cap austin is a motion of the minde nullo cogente no man constraining it to ad aliquid vel non amittendum vel adipiscendum the not losing or to the getting of something i shewed before that we admit no such necessitie of sinning but onely affirme that whatsoeuer a naturall man doth it is sinfull so that wee grant him libertie from constraint for the doing or not doing this or that action but denie that any action he doth is free from sinne and therefore he sins necessarily in all he doth the next point to be handled is concerning originall sinne after baptisme that is how farforth it remaineth after baptisme a point to bee well considered because hereupon depend many points of popery conclus i they say naturall corruption after baptisme is abolished and so say we but let vs see how farre it is abolished in originall sinne are three things i the punishment which is the first and second death ii guiltines which is the binding vp of the creature vnto punishment iii the fault or the offending of god vnder which i comprehend our guiltines in adams first offence as also the corruption of the heart which is a naturall inclination and pronenes to any thing that is euill or against the law of god for the first wee say that after baptisme in the regenerate the punishment of originall sin is taken away there is no condemnation saith the apostle to them that be in christ iesus rom for the second that is guiltines we further condescend and say that is also taken away in them that are borne anew for considering there is no condemnation to them there is nothing to bind them to punishment yet this caueat must be remembred namely that the guiltines is remoued from the person regenerate not from the sinne in the person but of this more afterward thirdly the guilt in adams first offence is pardoned and touching the corruption of the heart i auouch two things i that that very power or strength whereby it raigneth in man is taken away in the regenerate ii that this corruption is abolished as also the fault of euery actual sinne past so farre forth as it is the fault and sinne of the man in whom it is indeede it remaines till death and it is sinne considered in it selfe so long as it remaines but it is not imputed vnto the person and in that respect is as though it were not it being pardoned annotations vpon our consent first we say not that the punishment of originall sinne is in it or any part of it but rather a due correction and as it were an expulsion of it this is but a peccadillo neither doe we say that the punishment of originall sin is in it or any part of it but that in handling that point it is to be considered much lesse doe we charge you with saying so what it is you call a peccadillo or small sinne i vnderstand not certainly if you meane that originall sinne is small and deserues no punishment but a due correction either rom corinthian the death of all man in adam is no punishment or god punisheth without desert but there lurketh a serpent in that caueat that the guiltines of originall sinne is remoued from the person regenerate but not from the sinne in the person the like he saith afterward of the fault that it is a sinne still in it selfe remaining in the man till death but it is not imputed to him as being pardoned here hee quillets of very strange doctrine the sinne is pardoned and yet the guiltines of it is not taken away doth not a pardon take away from the fault pardoned all bond of punishment due vnto it and consequently all guiltines belonging to it who can deny this vnlesse he know not or care not what he say if then originall sinne be perdoned the guiltines of it is also remoued from it selfe againe what philosophy or reason alloweth vs to say that the offendour being pardoned for his offence the offence in it self remaineth guilty as though the offence separated from the person were a substance subiect to law and capable of punishment can originall sinne in itselfe die the first and second death or be bound vp to them what senselesse imaginations be these the sinne is pardoned so that the partie shall not be punisht for it but it is not so pardoned that in it self it hath not iust cause of punishment and this both philosophie and reason allow all our actuall sinnes are pardoned as soone as we beleeue in christ and yet they are truly sinnes whensoeuer afterward they are committed by vs againe how can the fault of originall sinne remaine in the man renewed by god grace although not imputed can there be two contrarios in one part of the subiect at once can there be light and darknes in the vnderstanding vertue and vice in the wil at the same instant can the soule be both truly conuerted to god and as truly auerted from him at one time is christ now agreed to dwell with belial and the holy ghost oontent to inhabit a body subiect to sinne all which must be granted contrary to both scripture and naturall sense if we admit the ault and deformitie of sinne to remaine in a man renewed and indued with god grace vnlesse we would very absurdly imagine that the fault and guilt of sinne were not inherent and placed in their proper subiects but were drawne thence and penned vp in some other odd corner remember also gentle reader that here m perkins affirmeth the power whereby the corruption of the hart raigneth in man is taken away in the regenerate which is cleane contrary to the first proposition of his first reason following as shall be there proued not being imputed hinders not the being of the thing there but rather proues it for if it were not there what fauour were it not to impute it who knowes not that contraries may bee in one part of the same subiect at once though not in the same respect do corinthian we not while we are here know in part and so remaine ignorant in part is not our wil imperfectly reformed the holy ghost is not content that the bodie he doth inhabit should be subiect to sinne and therefore hee labours continually to free it from that subiection but he is content to inhabit the man whom he hath begun to reforme that hee may purge him thoroughly thus far wee consent with the church of rome now the difference betweene vs stands not in the abolishment but in the manner and the measure of the abolishment of this sinne papists teach that originall sinne is so farre sorth taken away after baptisme that it ceaseth to bee a sin properly and is nothing else but a want defect and weakenes making the heart fitte and readie to conceiue sinne much like tinder which though it be not fire of it selfe yet is it very apt and fit to conceiue fire and they of the church of rome denie it to be sinne properly that they might vphold some grosse opinions of theirs namely that a man in this life may fulfill the law of god and doe good workes void of sinne that hee may stand righteous at the barre of god iudgement by them but wee teach otherwise that though original sinne be taken away in the regenerate and that in sundrie respects yet doth it remaine in them after baptisme not only as a want and weakenes but as a sinne and that properly as may by these reasons be prooued reason i rom paul saith directly it is no more i that doe it but sinne that dwelleth in me that is originall sinne the papists answere againe that it is so called improperly because it commeth of sinne and also is an occasion of sinne to be done i approue this interpretation of s paul as taken out of that auncient and famous papist saint augustine who saith expresly concupiscence whereof the apostle speaketh although it be called sinne yet is it not so called because it is sinne but for that it is made by sinne a vvriting is called the hand because it is made by the hand and in an other place repeating the same addeth that it may also be called sinne for that it is the cause of sinne as cold is called sloathfull because it ma es a man sloathfull so that the most profound doctor saint augustine is stiled a formall papist by m perkins shall be well coursed by the plaine circumstances of the place if s austin were a papist in this point because of this sentence questionlesse hee was in the same point a protestant because of some other which i will recite doest thou not marke aug contra iulian pelag lib cap saith austin doest thou not perceiue that he who doth so vehemently persecute his bodie if he doth persecute nothing that displeaseth god doth god great wrong by persecuting his temple frustra without cause now what i pray you displeaseth god but sinne but this corruption wee speake of is also hated of god and therefore day by day consumed as the physitian saith aug in ioan tract austin hates the disease of the sicke man and labours by curing it to driue away the disease and ease the diseased so doth god lab our by his grace in vs to consume sinne and deliuer man and that it is not onely sinne as it comes from sinne and causeth sinne but also properly as a disobedience austin shewes euidently by this similitude as blindnes of heart aug contra iulian p g lib cap saith he is both a sinne whereby we beleeue not in god and a punishment of sinne whereby the proud heart is worthily punished and a cause of sinne when any euill is committed by the error of the heart so that concupiscence of the flesh against which the good spirit lusteth is both sinne because there is in it disobedience against the gouernment of the minde and a punishment of sinne because it is reddita est meritis inobe dientis laid by desert vpon the disobedient and the cause of sinne by the defectione con ionis fault of consent or the contagione na cen contagion of birth yes austin doubts not to say as we doe that the guilt of concupiscence yet remaining is pardoned that it may not be imputed for sinne in them which are regenerate saith aug vbi supra austin when they receiue forgiuenes of all sinnes whatsoeuer it must needes be that the guilt also of this concupiscence yet remaining is forgiuen that as i said it may not be imputed in peccatum for sinne further it is plaine that austin acknowledged it to be sinne because he aug contra iulian pelag lib receiues and allowes of ambrose his opinion who calles it iniquitie because it is vniust that the flesh should lust against the spirit this sinne ad rom chrysostom and theophylact vnderstand to be our lothfull and corrupt will and a violent inclination to euill and lombard lib ist peter lombard saith that we are not altogether redeemed by christ from the guilt or fault but so that it reignes not in vs but by the circumstances of the text it is sinne properly for in the words following s paul saith that this sinne dwelling in him made him to doe the euill which he hated and verse he crieth out o wretched man that i am who shall deliuer me from this body of death for saith he that s paul there takes sinne properly appeares by the words following that this sinne dvvelling in him made him to doe the euill vvhich he ha a how proues this that sinne there must be taken properlie it rather proues that it must be taken improperly for if it made him doe the euill which he hated then could it not be sin properly for sinne is not committed but by the consent and liking of the vvill but s paul did not like that euill but hated it and thereby vvas so farre off from sinning that he did a most vertuous deed in resisting and ouercomming that euill as vvitnesseth s augustine saying reason sometimes resisteth manfully and ruleth raging concupiscence vvhich being done we sinne not but for that conflict are to be crowned this first circumstance then alleadged by m perkins doth rather make against him than for him the reason lies thus originall sinne dwelling in the apostle made him doe that euill he hates therefore it is sin properly you answere it rather prooues the contrarie because y which the apostle doth with hatred of it is not sin for sinne is not committed but with liking and consent of the will i answere that whatsoeuer a man doth against the law of god it is sinne whether he like or mislike it secondly that the consent of the will makes it not sinne but our sinne thirdly the apostle denies not that he doth this evil with his will for else he would not doe it but affirmes that he doth it against his iudgement as arist ethi lib cap euen naturall man doe that are ouercome of their affections witnes medea in meta or lib video me ora proboq deteriora quor ouid i see what is good and like it and doe that is euill otherwise such actions of theirs should not be sinne i denie not that the regenerate haue a greater hatred of the sinnes they fall into and vpon a better ground but yet the naturall man also oftentimes doe that which they mislike in general though they do it willingly that this was the apostles meaning he that will reade the rom verse chapter may easily perceiue i allow not saith he that i doe that is i know it to bee euill and i would faine leaue it vndone but the strength of my corruption is such that i am carried away to the doing of it and so because i am but in part regenerate in part i serue god and in part sinne as for that you adde out of de genes contra mani lib cap s austin it makes not any whit against vs who acknowledge that reason especially being regenerate oftentimes ouercomes concupiscence amp shall haue reward for it yet are not austins words as you report them but thus reason sometimes manfullie ref t atque compe t bridles and restraines concupiscence etiam com euen when it is stirred when it so happens we fall not into sin but cum aliquata luctatione corona ur with some little wrastling are crowned but sometimes againe as rom the apostle plainly confesseth it is vanquished by sinne or naturall corruption and drawne to the committing of some actuall sinne inward or outward which being euident master perkins reason is not answered as the sight of it may prooue that which dwelling in s paul made him doe that he hates is sinne properly indeede why should he hate it if it be not sinne but originall sinne dwelling in him made him doe that he hates therefore originall sinne is properly sinne novv to the second o wretched man that j am who shall deliuer mee from this body of death here is no mention of sinne hovv this may be dravvne to his purpose shall be examined in his argument vvhere he repeateth it so that there is not one poore circumstance of the text vvhich he can find to proue s paul to take sinne there properly that originall sinne called sinne by the apostle is sinne properly our diuines proue by the description the apostle makes of it in rom verse vers that chapter it is not good it hinders vs from doing good it drawes vs to the doing of euill it makes the apostle crie out oh wretched man that i am to which they adde out of other places heb it is an euill that doth compasse vs about gal rom it fights against the commandement thou shalt not lust column d b p this conclusion is faultie it is an euill to be crucified and mortified vpon al these descriptions of it we conclude that it is truly and properly sinne novv i vvill proue by diverse that he speakes of sinne improperly first by the former part of the same sentence jt is not i that doe it l sinne is done and committed properly by the person in vvhom it is but this vvas not done by s paul ergo let vs now see your proofes to the contrarie the first whereof you frame thus all sinne is done and committed properly by the person in whom it is but this was not done by s paul ergo all sinne is done and committed properly by the person in whom it is but this was not done by s paul ergo first your proposition is false secondly your conclusion is either false or not to the purpose your proposition hath two faults the one that in stead of saying all that is sinne properly is done ampc you say all that is sinne is done properly applying properly to the committing of sinne and not to the nature of it the other fault is that the matter of your proposition is vntrue for there is some sinne namely originall which is not done by him in whom it is but is bred with him if in your assumption you meane that the apostle doth not properly doe the euill which he hates you are deceiued for whether it be an inward action of the minde or an outward of the bodie it must needes be performed by some nature that hath a true being but there is no third nature in man besides the soule and bodie and what is done by either of these is done by the man of whom they are parts if you say it is done by a vicious qualitie in man that qualitie hauing subsistence in man as in the subiect of it is not properly the doer of the action but the facultie by which a man is fitted for the doing of it to your proofe i answere that rom the apostle consefleth he did it i allow not that which i doe what i hate that doe i i doe that which i would not the euill which i would not that doe i and at last he concludes i my selfe in my minde serue the law of god but in my flesh the law of sinne where he teacheth vs to expound his doing or not doing i doe not the euill which i hate that is in my minde or in respect of my regeneration i doe that is in regard of my corruption in my minde i my selfe serue the law of god in my flesh i my selfe serue the law of sinne i doe both my selfe but the one in my minde regenerate the other in my flesh vnregenerate if you will conclude for that you leaue at large in this reason it should seeme of purpose because in the other two you set downe your conclusion expressely therefore it is not properly sinne your conclusion is false because it containes more than is in the antecedent if your meaning be either that originall corruption is not sinne or that the euill which s paul hates is not sinne as one of these two you must needes meane your conclusion is from the purpose for the question is not whether originall sinne be sinne which both parts grant but whether it be properly sinne or no neither doe you vndertake to prooue that the euill which the apostle did with hatred of it is not sinne so that this first proofe of yours is neither for you nor against vs secondly out of those vvords i know there is not in me that is in my flesh any good and after i see an other law in my members resisting the lavv of my mind thus sinne properly taken is seated in the soule but that vvas seated in the flesh ergo it vvas no sinne properly sinne properly taken is seated in the soule but that was not seated in the soule but in the flesh therefore it was no sinne properly as the image of god after which wee were created was though principally yet not onely in the soule so the corruption of nature wherby that image is defaced hath place both in soule and bodie and therefore your proposition is not simply true but your assumption is simply false for by saying it was seated in the flesh you must needs denie that it was seated in the soule or else your syllogisme will be nothing worth now by flesh the apostle meanes nature vnregenerate both soule and bodie rom the wisedome of the flesh is nmitie against god signifying the very best part of a mans soule hence it is that he calles a naturall man animalem and wils vs to ephesians column be renewed in the spirit of our mind affirming that some are puft vp with their fleshly minde and i pray you consider whence these workes of the flesh arise gal idolatry witchcraft hatred debate heresies ampc the apostle aug de ciuit dei lib c saith austin ascribes those sinnes to the flesh which beare principallsway in the diuell who it is certaine hath no flesh for he saith enmitie contention emulation envy are workes of the flesh the head and fountaine whereof is pride which raigneth in the diuell though he haue no flesh yes de amiss gra lib c bellarmine himselfe grants though with much ado that concupiscence though it be as he saith principally in the sensuall part yet hath place also in the minde the third and last is taken out of the first words of the next chapter there is novv therefore no condemnation to them that are in christ iesus that vvalke not according to the flesh ampc whence i thus argue there is no condemnation to them that haue that sinne dvvelling in them if they vvalke not according vnto the fleshly desires of it therefore it is no sin properly for the vvages of sin is death that is eternall damnation if say you there be no condemnation to them that haue originall sinne dwelling in them so they walke not according to the fleshly desires of it then it is not properly sinne but there is no condemnation to them that haue originall sinne dwelling in them so they walke not according to the fleshly desires of it therefore it is not sin properly if by these words there is no condemnation you meane they shall not be condemned i denie the consequence of your proposition for it may be properly sinne though they in whom it is haue it not imputed to them to condemnation i denie your assumption whether you meane they are not condemned de facto or they deserue not condemnation de iure in the former sense you teach that all infants which die vnbaptized are shut out of heauen and yet none of them walke according to the fleshly desires of originall sinne in the latter sense we and you are wholy of opinion that originall sinne is a iust cause of condemnation euen to infants who actually sinne not the rom place alleaged by you serues not to prooue either of your propositions as you haue set them downe for the apostle saith not that there is no condemnation to them which walke not according to the fleshly desires of originall sinne but to them which are in christ iesus i grant that all but they which are in christ doe walke according to such desires yet it is not all one to say the one and the other for you seeme to bring that as a reason why there is no condemnation to them whereas the apostle addes these words to shew that they which are in christ do not walk after the flesh but after the spirit therein concluding his former disputation of rom iustification and rom sanctification thence i reason thus that which once was sinne properly and still remaining in man maketh him to sinne and intangleth him in the punishment of sinne and makes him miserable that is sinne properly but originall sinne doth all these ergo novv to master perkins argument in forme as he proposeth it that vvhich vvas once sinne properly and still remaining in man maketh him to sinne and intangleth him in the punishment of sinne and makes him miserable that is sinne properly but originall sinne doth all these ergo the ma or vvhich as the learned knovv should consist of three vvords containes foure seuerall points and vvhich is vvorst of all not one of them true if you meane three words as grammar speaks of words that you say is false for any proposition may containe three hundred such words and yet not offend against logike if you vnderstand three words as a logician there may be fourtie seuerall points in a proposition and yet but three words viz the antecedent part or subiect secondly the consequent part predicate or attribute and thirdly the bond by which they are coupled together so that herein you haue shewed either little skill or little honestie to blame him for foure seuerall points in stead of three words as if his syllogisme had as logicians speake foure termes and so were false in the forme of it the foure seueral points are these that which was once sinne properly makes him to sinne intangles him in the punishment of sinne makes him miserable all which make the first word or antecedent of the proposition the consequent is sinne properly the bond that ties these two together the verbe is now let both learned and vnlearned iudge whether the fault be in master perkins or in your ignorance or cauilling to the first that vvhich remaineth in man after baptisme commonly called concupiscence vvas neuer a sinne properly but only the materiall part of sinne the formall and principall part of it consisting in the depriuation of originall iustice and a voluntary auersion from the lavv of god the vvhich is cured by the grace of god giuen to the baptised and so that vvhich vvas principall in originall sinne do h not remaine in the regenerate it hath alreadie been prooued that it is sinne properly euen after baptisme if you meane that concupiscence the rom gal apostle speakes of against the commandement if you do not what haue we to doe with it in this question concupiscence or the facultie of desiring is no otherwise affected to sinne than reason is but the blindnes of the vnderstanding and the vitiousnes of the will which the apostle cals concupiscence are part of originall sinne the naturall faculties are not the parts but rather the seate of it or the subiect which in some respect may be said to be the matter sure the forme is as of all sinnes in general the aberration from or the contrarines of it to the law of god the depriuation you should say the absence of originall iustice is comprised in the aberration i spake of and so is that voluntarie auersion from god and goodnes besides which there is also an euill qualitie i know not how else to call it whereby we incline to that which is against the law of god this we call originall sinne or naturall corruption because we haue it from adam the originall of all mankinde and that from our first being together with our nature and in our nature though by creation it was not in our nature this is helped by the power of god spirit through the grace of sanctification both in the principall point and in the accessories yet is not the concupiscence wholy taken away but being deadly wounded dies by little and little in the children of god as they are assured it shall by the outward and inward baptisme through the power of christs death and resurrection notwithstanding as long as wee liue in this world it remaines the same thing it was before baptisme euen sinne properly but the hurt it hath is vnrecouerable and the strength abated neither doth that vvhich remaineth make the person to sin vvhich vvas the second point vnlesse he vvillingly consent vnto it as hath bin proued heretofore it allureth and intiseth him to sin but hath not povver to constraine him to it as master perkins also himselfe before confessed i deny your consequence it makes him to sinne though it doe not constraine him as the spirit of god makes vs beleeue though he inforce vs not to it novv to the third and intangleth him in the punishment of sinne hovv doth originall sinne intangle the regenerate in the punishment of sin if all the guiltines of it be remoued from his person as you taught before in our consent mendacem memorem esse oportet either confesse that the guilt of original sinne is not taken avvay from the regenerate or else you must vnsay this that it intangleth him in the punishment of sinne this doubt is alreadie answered that it intangles him because it makes him doe that by which he is guiltie of sin and deserues punishment howsoeuer the lord pardons his sinne in christ novv to the last clause that the reliques of originall sinen make a man miserable a man may be called vvretched and miserable in that he is in disgrace vvith god and so subiect to his heauy displeasure and that which maketh him miserable in this sense is sin but s paul taketh not the vvord so here but for an vnhappie man exposed to the danger of sinne and to all the miseries of this vvorld from vvhich vve should haue been exempted had it not been for originall sinne after vvhich sort he vseth the same vvord if in this life only we vvere hoping in christ we were more miserable then all man not that the good christians were farthest out of god fauour and more sinfull then other man but that they had fevvest vvorldly comforts and the greatest crosses and thus much in confutation of that formall argument it is strange you should so confidently set downe an vntruth in writing whereof you may so easily and certainely be conuinced the corinthian rom apostle doth not vse the same word but another that signifies to be pitied we were of all man most to be pitied but that the apostle complaines of miserie in respect of sinne by that word the vse of it otherwhere may prooue the revelation holy ghost saith of the church of laodicea that she was miserable and wretched the word signifying there either the miserie of sinne or pitie for that miserie and beggerly and blinde and naked houle yee rich man saith iam s iames for the miseries that shall come vpon you the apostle speakes not a word of any worldly miseries as you expound him but of the miserie he was in by the law of sinne which he serued and surely if in it selfe it be not sinne why should the apostle so much complaine of it since by the trouble it put him to it did but occasion him to shew his valour and as you papists say was a means to make him deserue a crowne of glorie reason ii infants baptized and regenerate die the bodily death before they come to the yeeres of discretion therfore original sin in them is sin properly or els they should not die hauing no cause of death in them for death is is the wages of sinne as the apostle saith rom amp rom death entred into the world by sinne as for actuall sinne they haue none if they die presently after they are borne before they come to any vse either of reason or affection ansvvere the cause of the death of such innocents is either the distemperature of their body or externall violence and god vvho freely bestowed their liues vpon them may when it pleaseth him as freely take their liues from them especially when he meanes to recompence them with the happy exchaunge of life euerlasting true it is that if our first parents had not sinned no man should haue died but haue bin both long preserued in paradise by the fruit of the wood of life and finally translated without death into the kingdome of heauen and therfore is it said most truely o s paul death entred into the vvorld by sin but the other place the vvages of sinne is death is fouly abused for the apostle there by death vnderstandeth eternall damnation as appeareth by the opposition of it to life euerlasting and by sinne there meaneth not originall but actuall sinne such as the romans committed in their infidelity the wages whereof if they had no repented them had b n hel fire now to inferre that innocents are punished with corporall death for originall sinne remaining in them because that eternall death is the due hire of actuall sinne is either to sh w great want of iudgement or else very strangely to peruert the words of holy scripture let this also not be forgotten that he himselfe acknowledged in our consent that the punishment of originall sin was taken away in baptisme from the regenerate how then doth he here say that he doth die the death for it master perkins reason is thus to be framed that which is the cause of bodilie death to infants baptised and regenerate is sinne properly but originall sinne is cause of bodily death to infants baptised and regenerate therefore it is sinne properly the proposition he proues by two rom amp places of scripture the assumption by shewing that they haue no actuall sinne and therefore since death is not but where sinne is originall sinne is cause of bodily death to infants that dye before they come to any vse of reason or affection first you deny the assumption viz that originall sinne is the cause of bodily death to infants but the reason of your deniall is insufficient for it doth not follow that originall sinne is not the cause of death to them because the meanes of their death is distemperature or externall violence for then the death of many reprobate man were no iudgement of god against sinne and though god of his absolute power may take away any mans life because he gaue it him yet it pleased his maiestie to binde himselfe to a course in the creation that death should be the consequent of sinne gen the day thou eatest thou shalt dye so that wheresoeuer we see death we may conclude there is sinne either really as in all adams posteritie or by imputation as in christ then you come to the proofe of the proposition where you graunt the rom one place to be rightly alleaged because death indeede had not found any place of entrie had it not been for sinne rom the other text you say is fo lly abused first because the apostle vnderstands by it eternall damnation he doth so principally but why may not death be taken as largely here as gen it is there from whence all these phrases of scripture come but there it signifies both kinds of death here s paul chiefely puts them in minde of the greater hauing shewed before that bodily death came into the world by the meanes of sinne and although the apostle be occasioned to deliuer that speech by reason of the romans actuall transgressions it doth not abate but sharpen the edge of his exhortation to expound the place of all sinne whatsoeuer for if there be no sinne no not originall but shall haue death for wages certainely these actuall transgressions shall be punisht with it master perkins in in our consent the place alleaged speakes of that punishment which is condemnation as the very words following declare in which he prooues that the punishment is taken away by that of the apostle rom there is no condemnation to them that are in christ iesus it is true that bodily death also is chaunged from being a punishment yet the reason of that death is the dwelling of sinne in the regenerate which by the dissoluing of the bodie through death must be abolisht if it had pleased god to haue giuen master perkins life that he might haue seene this your exception being better acquainted with your sleights and his owne meaning he would haue answered you more fully as in other poynts so in this also reason iii that which lusteth against the spirit and by lusting tempteth and in tempting intiseth and draweth the heart to sinne is for nature sinne it selfe but concupiscence in the regenerate lusteth against the spirit gal and tempteth as i haue said iam god tempteth no man but euery man is tempted when he is drawne away by his owne concupiscence and is inticed then when lust conceiueth it bringeth forth sinne and therefore it is sinne properly such as the fruite is such is the tree ansvvere the first proposition is not true for not euery thing that intiseth vs to sinne is sinne or else the apple that allured eue to sinne had been by nature sinne and euery thing in this world one vvay or an other tempteth vs to sinne according vnto that of s john all that is in the vvorld is the concupiscence of the flesh and the concupiscence of the eyes and pride of life so that it is very grosse to say that euery thing vvhich allureth to sinne is sinne it selfe and as vvide is it from all morall vvisdome to affirme that the first motions of our passions be sinnes for euen the very heathen philosophers could distinguish betweene sodaine passions of the mind and vices teaching that passions may be bridled by the vnderstanding and brought by due ordering of them into the ring of reason and so made vertues rather then vices and that same text vvhich m perkins bringeth to persvvade these temptations to be sinnes proues the quite contrary god tempteth no man but euery man is tempted vvhen he is dravvne avvay by his ovvne concupiscence and is allured aftervvard vvhen concupiscence hath conceiued it bringeth forth sinne marke the words well first concupiscence tempteth and allureth by some euill motion but that is no sinne vntill afterward it do conceiue that is obtaine some liking o our will in giuing eare to it and not expelling it so speedely as we ought to doe the suggestion of such an enemie the first proposition is true and your answere but a shift wherein you craftely leaue out the principall poynt to make a shew of reason the apple that allured eue to sinne did not lust against the spirit which is the first and chiefe poynt of master perkins proposition whereof you make no mention arist ethic lib cap philosophers speake according to their ignorance graunting to a man seed and sparkes of vertue by nature not vnderstanding that it was sinne to lust because rom the law of god which forbad it was vnknowne vnto them besides they spake of the passions as naturall things and so they are not sinne but good as being created by god but our question is of them as they are degenerated from their nature and corrupt a mere mysterie to naturall man the which that most deepe doctor saint augustine si eth out very profoundly in these words vvhen the apostle s iames saith euery man is tempted being dravvne avvay and allured by his concupiscence and aftervvard concupiscence vvhen it hath conceiued bringeth forth sin truly in these words the thing brought forth is distinguished from that vvhich bringeth it forth the damme is concupiscence the fole is sinne but concupiscence doth not bring sinne forth vnlesse it conceiue so then it is not sin of it selfe and it conceiueth not vnlesse it dravv vs that is vnlesse it obtaine the consent of our vvill to commit euill the like exposition of the same place and the difference betweene the pleasure tempting that runneth before and the sinne which followeth after unlesse vve resist manfully may be seene in s cyrill so that by the iudgement of the most learned auncient fathers the text of s james cited by m perkins to proue concupiscence to be sinne disproueth it very soundly to that reason of his such as the fruit is such is the tree i ansvvere that not concupiscence but the vvill of man is the tree vvhich bringeth forth either good or bad fruit according vnto the disposition of it concupiscence is onely an intiser vnto badde austin and cyril speake as the apostle doth of actuall sinne which is committed by those degrees and surely if concupiscence be not sinne without consent because the apostle saith it brings forth sinne when it hath conceiued by the like reason consent makes not sinne deadly because th apostle saith also that sinne when it is finisht brings forth death now we know consent euen with you may be deadly sinne and with vs alwaies is so concupiscence is of it selfe sinne though not in that height and kind that outward actuall sinnes are the first motion to wickednes is sinne because it is an action against the commaundement exod rom thou shalt not lust consent increaseth the wickednes of it the outward act makes vp the sinne which the apostle and the austin cyril fathers here speake of it should seeme the author of your glosse saw this who expounds brings forth sinne glossa ordin iacob perducit ad actum brings it to the acte or into action if the apostle saith as he doth that concupiscence brings forth sinne out of doubt concupiscence is the tree and as in the tree the naughtines of the sap is blamed for the badnes of the fruite so is the sinfulnes of the will for the euill actions though properly neither the sap but the tree brings forth the fruite nor concupiscence but the will is the mother of sinne but that concupiscence is properly sinne i shewed before concupiscence against which the spirit lusteth is sinne because in it there is disobedience against the rule of the minde and it is the punishment of sinne because it befalles man for the merits of his disobedience and it is the cause of sinne but s augustine saith that concupiscence is sinne because in it there is disobedience against the rule of the mind ampc i ansvvere that s augustine in more then tvventy places of his vvorkes teacheth expresly that concupiscence is no sinne if sinne be taken properly vvherefore vvhen he once calleth it sinne he taketh sinne largely as it comprehendeth not only all sinne but also all motions and inti ements to sinne in which sense concupiscence may be tearmed sinne but is so called very seldome of s augustine but more commonly an euill as in the same w ke is to be seene euidently where he saith that grace in baptisme doth renevve a man perfectly so farre forth as it appertaineth to the deliuerance of him from all manner of sinne but not so as it freeth him from all euill so that concupiscence remaining after baptisme is no manner of sinne in s augustines iudgement but may be called euill because it prouoketh vs to evil to this place of s augustine i will ioyne that other like which m perkins quoteth in his reason where he saith that sinne dwelleth alwaies in our members the same answere serueth that sinne there is taken improperly as appeareth by that he seates it in our members for according vnto s augustine and all the learned the subiect of sinne being properly taken is not in any part of the body but in the will and soule and in the same passage he signifieth plainely that in baptisme all sinnes and iniquity is taken away and that there is lefte in the regenerate only an infirmity or weakenes hauing prooued so manifestly in the former sections by scripture that originall corruption is properly sinne wee are desirous so to expound the fathers as they may best agree with the truth of scripture if you had rather set them against the scripture not we but you are to be blamed as enemy to them if any disgrace fall vpon them reason v the iudgement of the ancient church august epistle charitie in some is more in some lesse in some none the highest degree of all which cannot be increased is in none as long as man liues vpon earth and as long as it may be increased that which is lesse the it should be is in fault by which fault it is that there is no iust man vpon earth that doth good and sinneth not by which fault none liuing shall be iustified in the sight of god for which fault if we say we haue no sinne there is no truth in vs for which also though we profit neuer so much it is necessarie for vs to say forgiue vs our debts though all our words deedes and thoughts bee alreadie forgiuen in baptisme ans that here is neuer a word touching concupiscence or to proue originall sinne to remaine after baptisme which is in question but only hat the best man for want of perfect charity doe o ten sin venially which we graunt indeede as you pare it leauing out all these words by which fault none liuing shall be iustified in the sight of god for which fault if we say we haue no sin there is no truth in vs there is not much to prooue the poynt but your ampc hath cut off that which is most materiall viz by reason of our defect or failing in charitie which comes from our naturall corruption no man can say he is without sinne and by reason of which we must call vpon god for pardon of our sinnes indeede augustine in sundrie places seemes to denie concupiscence to bee sinne after baptisme but his meaning is that concupiscence in the regenerate is not the sinne of the person in whom it is for thus he expounds himselfe ad valer l c this is not to haue sinne not to be guiltie of sinne and lib cont iul the law of sinne in baptisme is remitted and not ended and tract in iob let not sinne raigne he saith not let not sinne be but let it not raigne for as long as thou liuest of necessitie sinne will be in thy members at the least looke it raigne not in thee ampc m perkins hauing thus strongly as you see fortified his position with that one sentence of s augustine which hath also nothing for his purpose insteed of all antiquitie confesseth ingenuously that s augustine in sundrie places denieth concupiscence to be sin but expounds him to meane that it is not sin in that person but in it selfe which is already confuted for sinne that is an accident and so properly inherent in his subiect cannot be at all if it be not in some person and the sinne of the same person master perkins as the places he brings out of austin shew doth not deny it simply to be the sinne of the person in whom it is but to be his to condemnation of it selfe it deserues to be punisht with eternall death but in him it is not a sinne procuring this punishment august ad vale ian lib cap lib instit cap number this is not to haue sinne not to be guiltie of sinne but it the protestant reader desire to be well assured of saint augustines opinion in this point let him see what their patriarke john caluin saith of it where thus he writeth neither is it needfull to labour much in searching out what the olde writers thought of this point when one augustine may serue the turne who with great diligence hath faithfully collected togither all their sentences let the readers therefore take out of him if they desire to haue any certainety of the iudgement of antiquity hitherto somewhat honestly what followeth moreouer betweene him and vs there is this difference that he truly dares not call the disease of concupiscence a sin but to expresse it is content to vse the word of infirmity then loe doth he say that it is made sinne when the acte of our consent doth ioyne with it but we h ld that very thing to be sinne wherewith a man is in any sort tickled obserue first good reader that s augustines opinion with him carrieth the credit of all antiquitie which is the cause that i cite him more often against them secondly that he is tly on our side teaching concupiscence not to be sinne vnlesse we doe consent vnto it lastly learne to mislike the blind boldnes of such masters who hauing so highly comended s augustines iudgement in this very matter and aduised all man to follow it doth notwithstanding flie from it himselfe presuming that some vvould be so shalovv vvitted as not to espie him or else content to relie more vpon his onely credit then vpon the authority of all the auncient fathers for a tast of who e consent with s augustine in this question i will here put the sentences of some few that i need not hereafter returne to rehearse them caluin saith not as you translate him betweene him and vs there is this difference but this videri potest interesse may seeme to be the difference because he was loth to speake so plaine as we now are forced to doe though in caluin his opinion his iudgement was all one with ours s chrysostom saith passions be not sinnes of themselues but the vnbridled excesse of them doth make sinnes and that j may for example sake touch one of them concupiscence is not a sinne but when passing measure it breakes his bounds then loe it is adultery not in regard of concupiscence but in respect of the excessiue and vnlavvfull riot of it s bernard vvhom m perkins often citeth against vs and therefore may sometimes be alleadged for vs hath these vvords sinne is at the doore but if thou doe not open it it vvill not enter in lust tickleth at the heart but vnlesse thou vvillingly yeeld vnto it it shall doe thee no hurt vvith old thy consent and it preuaileth not s augustine and s cyrill haue been cited already s hierome and s gregory shall be hereafter vvho vvith the confession of caluin may serue sufficiently to proue that approued antiquitie is vvholy for vs and if any desire to knovv the founder of our aduersaries doctrine in this point let him read the heresie recorded by that auncient and holy bishop epiphanius vvhere he registreth one proclus an old rotten sectarie to haue taught that sinnes are not taken avvay in baptisme but are only couered which is as much to say as sinne remaineth still in the person regenerate but is not imputed to him which is iust m perkins and our protestant position chrysostom speakes of the affections as they are naturall in which respect indeede they are not sinnes but only as they are disordered against the law of god in their creation the concupiscence he names is not originall sinne whereof we dispute but the naturall desire which adam had by creation and which is not in it selfe euill but as by our corruption it inclines now to euill and hath euill mingled with it in the act of desiring any man may see that bernard intends not to proue that originall sinne is properly sinne but that it shall not preuaile to make vs commit grosse sinne outwardly vnlesse we consent to it and thereby incourageth christian man to resist it affirming that it shal not hurt them to condemnation in which respect austin denies it to be sinne see my ansvvere to the epistle dedicatorie and my defence of the prologue proclus howsoeuer deceiued by origin he erred in the point of the resurrection yet in this matter taught nothing but that which he sufficiently confirmed by s pauls authoritie of whom he had learned the doctrine neither doe epiphanius or methodius bring any good proofe against his opinion or for their own as you write before of hierome vrge their reasons and you shall haue answere the arguments which the church of rome alleadgeth to the contrary are these obiect i in baptisme man receiue perfect and absolute pardon of sinne and sinne beeing pardoned is taken quite away and therefore originall sinne after baptisme ceaseth to be sinne answer sinne is abolished two waies first in regard of quoad imputationem imputation to the person secondly in regard of quoad existentiam existing and beeing for this cause god vouchsafeth to man two blessings in baptisme remission of sinne and mortification of the same remission or pardon abolisheth sinne wholy in respect of any imputation thereof vnto man but not simply in regard of the being thereof mortification thereof goeth further and abolisheth in all the powers of bodie and soule the very concupiscence or corruption it selfe in respect of the being thereof and because mortification is not accomplished till death therefore originall corruption remaineth till death though not imputed m perkins answereth that it is abolished in regard of imputation that is is not imputed to the person but remaines in him still this answere is sufficiently i hope confuted in the annotations vpon our consent in confirmation of our argument i will adde some texts of holy scripture first he that is vvashed needeth not but to vvash his feete for be is vvholy cleane take with this the exposition of s gregory the great our apostle he cannot saith he be called vvhaly cleane in vvhom any part or parcell of sins remaineth but let no man resist the voice of truth who saith he that is washed in baptisme is wholy cleane therefore there is not one dramme of the contagion of sinne left in him vvhom the cleanser himselfe doth professe to be wholy cleane because you content your selfe with your former answer i will make no further replie but proceed to examine your reasons the place you bring is allegoricall and therefore being not expounded in the scripture vnfit to prooue any matter in controuersie but if wee take it as spoken of baptisme it makes more against you than for you as appeares by this syllogisme he that hath foule feete is not wholy cleane but he that is washed hath foule feete therefore he that is washed is not wholy cleane so that our sauiours speech must be thus vnderstood he that is washed lackes but onely making cleane of his feete and then he is wholy cleane this gregory vvas next neighbour to boniface the third the first pope in vvhom antichrist vvas discoue ed gregories speech for it is more than i know that he is a saint and i am sure hee was none of our apostle that neuer bestowed any paines to teach vs auowes the proposition of my syllogisme that they which neede to haue their feete washt are not wholie cleane now the assumption our sauiour makes affirming that hee which is washt hath yet neede to haue his feete washt that he may be wholy cleane so that your proofes confirme my reason the very same doth the most learned doctor s ierome affirme saying how are vve iustified and sanctified if any inne be le t remaining in vs againe if holy king dauid say thou shalt vvash me and j shall be vvhiter then snovv how can the blacknes of hell still remaine in his soule there is no such thing in the epistle and if there were it could make nothing for your purpose because hierome disputes there not of originall but of actuall sinne viz of that which was thought to be a sinne but indeede as hee plainly shewes was none the marying of a second wife after baptisme besides he speakes not of rooting out sinne but directly as wee doe of taking it away by pardoning of it so also doth psalm rom dauid as it is manifest neither did hee meane that god should wash by baptisme and so clense him from originall sinne but that he should take away the guilt and staine of the murther and adulterie that hee had committed briefly it cannot be but a notorious wrong vnto the precious blood of our sauiour to hold that it is not aswell able to purge and purifie vs from sinne as adams transgression was of force to infect vs yes the apostle teacheth vs directly that we recouer more by christs grace then we lost through adams fault in these words but not as the offence so also the gift for if by the offence of one many died so much more the grace of god and the gift in the grace of one man iesus christ hath abounded vpon many if then we through christ receiue more abundance of grace then we lost by adam there is no more sinne left in the newly baptised man then was in adam in the state of innocence albeit other defects and infirmities doe remaine in vs for our greater humiliation and probation yet all filth of sinne is cleane scoured out or our soules by the pure grace of god powred abundantly into it in baptisme and so our first argument s ands insoluble if we through christ say you receiue more abundance of grace than we lost by adam there is no more sinne left in the newly baptized man than was in adam in the estate of innocencie but we through christ receiue more abundance of grace than we lost in adam therefore there is no more sinne left in the newly baptized man than was in adam in the state of innocencie i denie the consequence of your proposition for though wee receiue more grace yet it is not bestowed vpon vs at once but growes by little and little receiuing perfection at our death and not before your assumption is true in respect of the assured continuance of grace which adam had not but the measure is not greater for adam was created in true holines and righteousnes perfect according to his nature but the place you alleage proues not the point the rom apostle speakes not there of inherent righteousnes but of grace that is the fauour and mercie of god and of the gift by grace that is forgiuenes of sinnes as i will shew if it please god hereafter vpon another occasion obiect ii euery sinne is voluntarie but originall sinne in no man after baptisme is voluntarie and therefore no sinne answer the proposition is a politike rule pertaining to the courts of man and must be vnderstood of such actions as are done of one man to another and it doth not belong to the court of conscience which god holdeth and keepeth in mens hearts in which euery want of conformitie to the law is made a sinne secondly i answer that originall sinne was voluntarie in our first parent adam for he sinned and brought this miserie vpon vs willingly though in vs it be otherwise vpon iust cause actuall sinne was first in him and then originall corruption but in vs originall corruption is first and then actuall sinne reply full litle knowes this man what belongeth to the court of conscience there secret faults in deed be examined but nothing is taken for sinne by any one learned in that faculty which is done without a mans free consent all of them holding with s augustine that sinne is so voluntary an euill that it cannot be sinne which is not voluntary and to say with m perkins that any want of conformity to reason in our body is sinne is so absurd that a man might if that were true be damned for a dreame how well soeuer disposed he went to sleepe if he chaunce to dreame of vncleannes whereupon doth ensue any euill motion in his flesh this paradoxe of sinning without a mans consent is so contrarie vnto both naturall and supernaturall reason that s augustine auerreth neither any of the small number of the learned nor of the multitude of the vnlearned doe hold that a man can sinne without his consent what vnlearned learned man then are start vp in our miserable age that make no bones to deny this and greater matters too master perkins hath truly answered that although man know no sinne but that which is voluntarie because they make all sinne to be in the act yet in god iudgement it is otherwise who condemnes all for sinne that is any way against his iust and holy law the place you alleage out of austin prooues no more but that those actions that are not voluntarie are not sinne which wee easily grant but a second ansvvere of master perkins omitted master perkins addes a ond answere which you craftily according to your custome omit because you know not what to say to it the answere is that originall sinne may be called voluntarie because adams sinne was voluntarie and so ours in him as retract lib cap bellarm de amiss grat lib cap austin truly affirmes those dreames that are occasioned by any fault of ours or by our naturall corruption are our sinnes and to them that are not in christ damnable obiect iii where the forme of any thing is taken away there the thing it selfe ceaseth also but after baptisme in the regenerate the forme of originall sinne that is the guilt is quite remoued and therefore sinne ceaseth to be sinne answer the guilt or obligation to punishment is not the forme of originall corruption but as we say in schooles an accident or necessarie companion thereof the true forme of originall sinne is a defect and depriuation of that which the law requireth at our hands in our minde will affections and in all the powers both of soule and bodie but they vrge this reason further saying where the guilt and punishment is taken away there is no fault remaining but after baptisme the guilt and punishment is remoued and therefore though originall corruption remaine it is not as a fault to make vs guiltie before god but onely as a weaknes answer guilt is remoued and not remoued it is remooued from the person regenerate which stands not guiltie for any sinne originall or actuall but guilt is not remoued from the sinne it selfe or as some answere there be two kindes of guilt actuall and potentiall the actuall guilt is whereby sin maketh man stand guiltie before god and that is remoued in the regenerate but the potentiall guilt which is an aptnes in sinne to make a man stand guiltie if he sinne that is not remooued and therefore still sinne remaineth sinne to this or like effect saith august contra iul lib c we say that the guilt of concupiscence not whereby it is guiltie for that is not a person but that whereby it made man guiltie from the beginning is pardoned and that the thing it selfe is euill so as the regenerate desire to be healed of this plague m perkins shifteth in assigning a wrong forme affirming vs to say that the forme of originall sinne is the guiltines of it which we hold to be neither the forme nor matter of it but as it were the proper passion following it s e s thomas who deliuereth for the forme of originall sinne the priuation of originall iustice which iustice made the will subiect to god the deordination then of the will mistres and commaunder of all other points in man made by the priuation of originall iustice is the forme of original sinne and the deordination of all other parts of man which by a common name is called concupiscence as that learned doctor noteth is but the materiall part of that sinne so that the will of the regenerate being by grace through christ rectified and set againe in good order towards the law of god the forme of originall sinne which consist d in deordination of it is taken quite away by baptisme and so consequently the sinne it selfe vvhich cannot be vvithout his proper forme as the argument doth conuince the forme of originall sinne as i shewed before is not onely the absence of righteousnes but also an habituall inclination to euill which is not wholy taken away in this life but onely by degrees diminished and in death vtterly abolished obiect iv lastly for our disgrace they alleage that we in our doctrine teach that originall sinne after baptisme is onely clipped or pared like the haire of a mans head whose rootes still remaine in the flesh growing and increasing after they are cut as before answer our doctrine is abused for in the paring of any thing as in cutting of the haire or in lopping a tree the roote remaines vntouched and therupon multiplieth as before but in the mortification of originall sinne after baptisme wee hold no such paring but teach that in the very first instant of the conuersion of a sinner sinne receiueth his deadlie wound in the roote neuer afterward to be recouered conferre this last answere with his former doctrine good reader and thou maist learne what credit is to be giuen to such masters no more constant then the wind here sinne is deadly vvounded in the roote there it remaineth still vvith all the guiltines of it although not imputed there it still maketh the man to sinne intangleth him in the punishment of sinne and maketh him miserable all this he comprehended before in this first reason and yet blusheth not here to conclude that he holdeth it as at the first neither clipped nor pared but pulled vp by the rootes indeed they doe him a fauour who say that he holdeth sinne to be clipped and as it were razed for albeit haire razed grow out againe yet is there none for a season but this original sinne of his is alwaies in his regenerate in vigour to corrupt all his workes and to make them deadly sinnes but let this suffice for this matter this is a meere cauill of yours and no contradiction of master perkins originall sinne hath all these effects and yet is not wholy rooted vp as you falsely make him speake but wounded in the roote so deadly see article part article as that it neither shal nor can recouer though it liue and bring forth fruites of sinne for the time of our continuance in this mortall carcasse i conclus we hold and beleeue that a man in this life may be certeine of saluation and the same thing doth the church of rome teach and hold ii conclus we hold and beleeue that a man is to put a certeine affiance in god mercy in christ for the saluation of his soule and the same thing by common consent holdeth the foresaid church this point maketh not the difference betweene vs iii conclus we hold that with assurance of saluation in our harts is ioyned doubting and there is no man so assured of his saluation but he at sometime doubteth thereof especially in the time of temptation and in this the papists agree with vs and we with them to this conclusion the papist ansvvers not so sir but he shevves not vvhat it is he mislikes in it iv conclus they goe further and say that a man may be certeine of the saluation of man or of the church by catholike faith and so say we v concl yes they hold that a ma by faith may be assured of his own saluation through extraordinary reuelation as abraham amp others were and so do we here he ads that in this sense only the first conclusion is true viz that there is no assurance but by reuelation we ansvvere that this reuelation is common to all true beleeuers in their seuerall proportions vi conclus they teach that we are to be certeine of our saluation by bellar lib pag cl speciall faith in regard of god that promiseth though in regard of our selues and our indisposition wee cannot and in the former point they consent with vs the very maine point of difference lies in the manner of assurance i conclus we hold that a man may be certeine of his saluation in his owne conscience euen in this life and that by an ordinary and speciall faith they hold that a man is certeine of his saluation onely by hope both of vs hold a certeinty we by faith they by hope ii conclus further we hold and auouch that our certeinty by true faith is vnfallible they say their certeinty is only probable iii conclus and further though both of vs say that we haue confidence in god mercy in christ for our saluation yet we doe it with some difference for our confidence commeth from certeine and ordinary faith theirs from hope ministring as they say but a coniecturall certeinty thus much of the difference now let vs see the reasons to and fro obiect i where there is no word there is no faith for these two are relatiues but there is no word of god saying cornelius beleeue thou peter beleeue thou and thou shalt be saued and therefore there is no such ordinary faith to beleeue a mans owne particular saluation ans the proposition is false vnlesse it be supplied with a clause on this manner where there is no word of promise nor any thing that doth counteruaile a particular promise there is no faith but say they there is no such particular word it is true god doth not speake to man particularly beleeue thou and thou shalt be saued but yet doth he that which is answerable hereunto in that he giueth a generall promise with a commandement to apply the same and hath ordained the holy ministerie of the word to applie the same to the persons of the hearers in his owne name and that is as much as if the lord himselfe should speake to man particularly to speake more plainely in the scripture the promises of saluation be indefinitely propounded it saith not any where if i hn will beleeue he shall be saued or if peter will beleeue he shall be saued but whosoeuer beleeueth shall be saued now then comes the minister of the word who standing in the roome of god and in the stead of christ himselfe takes the indefinite promises of the gospel and laies them to the harts of euery particular man and this in effect is as much as if christ himselfe should say cornelius beleeue thou and thou shalt be saued peter beleeue thou and thou shalt be saued here m perkins contrary to his custome giueth the first place to our reasons which he calleth obiections and endeuoureth to supplant them and afterward planteth his owne about the order i will not contend seeing he acknowledgeth in the beginning that he obserueth none but sets downe things as they came into his head otherwise he would haue handled iustification before saluation but following his method let vs come to the matter reply good sir seeing euery man is a lyar and may both deceiue and be deceiued and the minister telling may erre how doth either the minister know that the man to whom he speaketh is of the number of the elect or the man be certaine that the minister mistaketh not when he assureth him of his saluation to affirme as you doe that the minister is to be beleeued aswell as if it were christ himselfe is plaine blasphemie equalling a blinde and lying creature vnto the wisedome and truth of god if you could shew out of god word that euery minister hath such a commission from christ then had you answered the argument directly which required but one warrant of god vvord but to say that the assurance of an ordinary ministers vvord counteruailes god vvord i cannot see vvhat it vvanteth of making a pelting minister god mate on the otherside to auerre that the minister knowes who is predestinate as it must be graunted he doth if you will not haue him to lie when he saith to peter thou article one of the elect i to make him of god priuie councell without any warrant for it in god word yes s paul not obscurely signifying the contrary in these words the sure foundation of god standeth hauing this seale our lord knoweth vvho be his and none else except he reueile it vnto them you vtterly mistake master perkins who doth not say that the minister is to assure any man of his saluation but to applie the generall promises of scripture to euery man particularly vpon condition of beleeuing the generall is whosoeuer beleeues shall be saued the ministers particular application cornelius beleeue thou and thou shalt be saued this is so plainly set downe by master perkins that i wonder how you could mistake him and so certainly grounded vpon the generall that there can no question be made of it neither doth this equall the minister to christ but as master perkins truly saith is as much in effect as if christ himselfe should say cornelius beleeue thou and thou shalt be saued for if it be true that whosoeuer beleeues shall be saued it is as true that cornelius shall be saued if he beleeue so that your discourse of the ministers knowledge and the mans election is nothing to master perkins answere it is answered that this applying of the gospell is vpon condition of mens faith and repentance and that man are deceiued touching their owne faith and repentance and therefore faile in applying the word vnto themselues answer indeed this manner of applying is false in all hypocrites heretikes and vnrepentant persons for they applie vpon carnall presumption and not by faith neuerthelesse it is true in all the elect hauing the spirit of grace and prayer for when god in the ministerie of the word being his owne ordinance saith seeke ye my face the heart of god children truly answereth o lord i will seeke thy face and when god shall say thou article my people they shall say againe the lord is my god m perkins then flieth from the assurance of the minister and leaues him to speake at andon as the blind man casts his clubbe and attributeth all this assurance vnto the partie himselfe who hearing in god word seeke yee my face in his hart answereth lord i vvill seeke thy face and then hearing god say thou article my people saith againe the lord is my god and then loe without all doubt he hath assurance of his saluation would ye not thinke that this were rather some seely old womans dreame then a discourse of a learned man how know you honest man that those words of god spoken by the prophet yeares past to the people of israell are directed to you mine owne hart good sir tells me so how dare you build vpon the perswasion of your owne hart any such assurance when as in holy writ it is recorded vvicked is the hart of man and who shall know it are you ignorant how saul before he was s paul being an israelite to whom those words appertained perswading himselfe to be very assured of his faith was notwithstanding fouly deceiued and why may not you farre more vnskilfull then he be in like manner abused moreouer suppose that this motion commeth of the holy ghost and that he truly saith the lord is god how long knoweth he that he shall be able to say so truly when our sauiour christ iesus assureth vs that many be called but few of them are chosen to life euerlasting how knoweth he then assuredly that he being once called is of the predestinate your question in skorne to the honest man is nothing to master perkins answere he doth not say that those places of the prophet belong to euery man but that all the elect yeeld obedience to god in the ministerie of the word beleeuing as he commands them and so vpon the knowledge of their beleefe come to the assurance of their saluation as for the doubt that a man may be called and be none of the predestinate he that truly beleeues the scripture casts it quite away hauing learned of god that whosoeuer beleeues shall be saued which could not bee true if it were possible that a man should beleeue and not be predestinate and it is a truth of god that he which beleeueth knoweth that he beleeueth and he that truly repenteth knoweth that he repenteth vnlesse it be in the beginning of our conuersion and in the time of distresse and temptation otherwise what thankfulnes can there be for grace receiued m perkins saith that he who beleeueth knoweth that he beleeueth be it so if he beleeue aright and meddle no further then with those things which be comprehended within the bounds of faith but that the certainty of saluation is to be beleeued is not to be begged but proued being the maine question he saith further that he who truly repenteth knoweth that he repenteth he knoweth indeed by many probable coniectures but not by certainly of faith as wit l h that holy person if god come to me as he dot all repentant sinne i shall not see him and if he depart away from me i shall not vnderstand it which is sufficient to make him thankefull yes i he receiued no grace at all yet were he much beholding vnto god who offered him his grace and would haue freely bestowed it vpon him if it had not been through his owne default and thus our first argument stands in his full strength and vertue that no man can assure himselfe by faith of his saluation because there is no word of god that warranteth him so to doe if corinthian he that beleeues aright know he beleeues and withall is sure that no act rom man doth beleeue but he that is predestinate because that marc ioh rom whosoeuer beleeues shall be saued and rom ephesian rom none shall be saued but they that are predestinate it is out of doubt that assurance of saluation by faith may and must be had now why or how should it be more impossible to know we repent truly then that wee beleeue truly especially since that and this necessarily and certainly goe together euery man that hath true faith and no man but he that hath true faith doth repent truly that of iob iob is not spoken of mans repentance but of his inabilitie to comprehend the workes of god as the whole discourse shewes neither are the words if ye come to me but as also arias montanus amp pagnin ibi arias montanus and pagnine expound them behold he passeth by non cognosc us illum per opera vatablus vnderstands the place of not knowing god by his workes master perkins asks what thankfulnes there can be for grace receiued if a man cannot know that he hath receiued any as for the coniecture you speake of it is likelier to breed feare than thankfulnes being so vncertaine or at the least thankfulnes by halues because wee can be but halfe perswaded that we haue receiued grace obiect ii it is no article of the creede that a man must beleeue his owne saluation and therfore no man is bound thereto ans by this argument it appeares plainly that the very pillars of the church of rome doe not vnderstand the creed for in that which is commonly called the apostles creed euery article implieth in it this particular faith and in the first article i beleeue in god are three things contained the first to beleeue that there is a god the second to beleeue the same god is my god the third to put my confidence in him for my saluation and so much containe the other articles which are concerning god when thomas said ioh my god christ answered thou hast beleeued thomas where we see that to beleeue in god is to beleeue god to be our god and psalm to beleeue in god and to put trust in him are al one they beleeued not in god and trusted not in his helpe i a mit all this and adde more that m perkins be no loger ignorant catholike knowledge of the creede that we must also loue him wi a hart and strength thus we vnderstand it more fully then he yet finde not out that thirteenth article thou must beleeue thine ovvne particular saluation for albeit i beleeue and trust in god yet not be ng sure of my loue towards him i am not assured of saluation for as s john estifieth he th th not a ideth in death a man may be bound to beleeue his owne saluation though it bee not among those twelue articles of the apostles creed article part article d which your selues denie to be the limit of beleefe master perkins knew as well as you that by one part of god worship the whole was signified and for the point in question denies your assertion viz that he cannot be sure of his loue towards god for he that can be sure he hath faith may be as sure he hath loue because no man is iustified but he that is also rom sanctified and the articles concerning remission of sinnes and life euerlasting do include and we in them acknowledge our speciall faith concerning our owne saluation for to beleeue this or that is to beleeue there is such a thing and that the same thing belongs to me as when dauid said i should haue fainted except i had beleeued to see the goodnesse of the lord in the land of the liuing psalm so i answere to the second article named by m perkins that is i beleeue that god of his infinite mercy through the merits of christs passion doth pardon all those who being hartely sorry for their sinnes doe humblie confesse them and fully purpose to lead a new life that i my selfe am such a one i doe verily hope because i haue as farreforth as i could to my knowledge performed those things which god requires osme but because i am but a fraile creature and may perhaps not haue done all that so well as i ought or am not so well assured of that which by god helpe i haue done i cannot beleeue it for in matter of faith as you shall heare shortly there can be no feare or doubt he that will ground his hope vpon his performance of that which god requires of him as farre foorth as he can hath no reason in the world to hope for any pardon for who is so bewitched with selfe loue that hee discernes not how marueilously he hath failed in doing that he might do both in nature and grace but a true christian beleeues that whosoeuer rests vpon god for saluation by iesus christ is by that faith truly iustified and so much he knowes of himselfe though he be priuie to many imperfections in his own cariage about the meanes and measure of beleeuing it is answered that in those articles we onely professe our selues to beleeue remission of sinnes and life euerlasting to be vouchsafed to the people and church of god ans this indeede is the exposition of many but it stands not with common reason for if that be all the faith that is there confessed the diuell hath as good a faith as we he knoweth and beleeueth that there is a god and that this god imparteth remission of sinnes and life euerlasting to his church and to the ende that we being god children may in faith go beyond all the diuels in hel we must further beleeue that remission of sinnes and life euerlasting belongs vnto vs and vnlesse we doe particularly applie the said articles vnto our selues we shall little or nothing differ from the diuell in making confession of faith the like answere is giuen to the article of life euerlasting i beleeue that i shal haue life euerlasting if i fulfill that which our sauiour taught the young man demaunding what he must doe to haue life euerlasting to wit if i keepe all god commaundements but because i am not assured that i shall so doe yes the protestant though falsely assure vs that no man by any helpe of god grace can so doe i remaine in feare but saith m perkins the diuell may so beleeue the articles of the creede vnlesse we doe applie those articles to our selues first i say the diuels know to be true all that we doe beleeue and therefore are said by saint iames to b leeue but they want a necessarie condition of faith that is a godly and deuou submission of their vnderstanding vnto the obedience of faith and so haue no aith to speake properly againe they trust not in god for saluation no indeuour not any manner of way to obtaine saluation as christians do and so there is great difference betweene their bel in the articles of the creede and ours the voice of the gospell is that ma whosoeuer beleeues shall be s au d that matth speech of our sauiour is not a direction how to come to life euerlasting by the gospell for it containes not sorgiuenes of sins nor faith in christ matth act the chiefe matter of it but a le on for that proud pharisie that hee might be conuinced by his owne confidence which appeares by that matth second answere of our sauiour wherein he shewes that the law requires per fit obedience which he had not attained to indeede you papists and some i grant before popery brake out dreame of a perfection beyond the law but we account the law so perfect that if the mans answere had been true he might well haue gone away assured of heauen though he had giuen neuer a penny more to the poore but died the richest man in all the world our claime to euerlasting life is not by the law rom doe this but by the gospell beleeue and thou shalt be saued that which you bring of the diuels beleeuing doth not any way ouerthrow master perkins answere you propound two differences that you haue conceiued between the faith of christians and diuels as if you would thereby refute master perkins who saith not that their faith and ours is all one but that if no more be required but to beleeue remission of sinnes and life euerlasting to be vouchsafed to the people and church of god their faith is as good as ours you replie that there are two differences but this doth not weaken master perkins consequence if there be no more required their faith is as good as ours you denie the assumption viz that the diuels faith is as good as ours and so dispute for him against the obiection m perkins in his first exception graunts that commonly man doe not beleeue their saluation as infallibly as they do the articles of the faith yet saith he some speciall man doe whereof i inferre by his owne confession that our particular saluation is not to be beleeued by faith for whatsoeuer we beleeue by faith is as infallible as the word of god which assureth vs of it the if the common sort of the faithfull doe not beleeue their saluation to be as infallible as the articles of our creede yes as god owne word they are not by faith assured of it now that some speciall good man either by reuelation from god or by long exercise of a vertuous life haue a great certainty of their saluation we willingly confesse but that certainty doth rather belong to a well grounded hope then to an ordinary faith your answere vpon master perkins grant is insufficient commonly saith master perkins man do not beleeue their saluation as they doe the articles of faith therefore say you by his owne confession our particular saluation is not to be beleeued by faith i denie the consequence your conclusion is not rightly inferred man doe not commonly therefore they are not bound to doe or therefore it is not possible they should either of both the meanes you name is sufficient to breed assurance of faith for the former who euer durst imagine that reuelation from god breedes not certaintie of faith the latter also passeth hope for a life truly vertuous argues true sanctification and that iustification which is not attained to but by true faith and whosoeuer beleeues shall be saued as for falling away from faith it is impossible as if neede be shall be prooued when occasion is offered object iii we are taught to pray for the pardon of our sinnes day by day matth and all this were needelesse if wee could be assured of pardon in this life ans the fourth petition must be vnderstood not so much of our old debts or sins as of our present and new sinnes for as we goe on from day to day so we adde sinne to sinne and for the pardon of them we must humble our selues and pray i answere againe that wee pray for the pardon of our sinnes not because wee haue no assurance thereof but because our assurance is weake and smal wee grow on from grace to grace in christ as children doe to mans estate by little and little the heart of euery beleeuer is like a vessell with a narrow necke which being cast into the sea is not filled at the first but by reason of the straight passage receiueth water droppe by droppe god giueth vnto vs in christ euen a sea of mercie but the same on our parts is apprehended and receiued onely by little and little as faith groweth from age to age and this is the cause why man hauing assurance pray for more good sir doe you not see how you ouerthrow your selfe if your assurance be but weake and small it is not the assurance of faith which is as great and as strong as the truth of god we giue god thankes for those giftes which we haue receiued at his bountifull hands and desire him to encrease or continue them if they may be lost but to pray to god to giue vs those things we are assured of by faith is as fond and friuolous as to pray him to make christ our lord to be his son or that there may be life euerlasting to his saints in heauen of which they are in full and assured possession and so these three arguments by m perkins propounded here for vs are very substantiall and sufficient to assure euery good christian that he may well hope for saluation doing his duty but may not without great presumption assure him by faith of it it is necessarie for vs article par article daily to craue pardon although before we were assured of it in some measure first because we haue a commandement which must be simply obeyed secondly because we must renew our repentance as we renew our sinnes our assurance though it be weake is the assurance of faith failing not in truth for the nature of it but in quantitie for the measure it should be without doubt but it is not to these i will adde two or three others which m perkins afterwards seekes to salue by his exceptions as he tearmes them o his first exception i haue answered before the second i will put last for orders sake and answere to the third master perkins hauing answered the popish obiections propounded by him proceeds to confirme our doctrine by sixe reasons whereof the fiue first are drawne from the scriptures against which the papists except three waies to those exceptions master perkins answeres in their order and place that order this papist alters and to serue his own turne answers the exceptions before he propound the reasons to which they are taken afterward he shifts off the reasons as well as he can the plainest course for me is to set downe master perkins words and by a b c to referre the reader to the papists answers and replies as they belong to master perkins disputation reason i the first reason may bee taken from the nature of faith on this manner true faith is both an vnfallible assurance and a particular assurance of the remission of sinnes and of life euerlasting and therefore by this faith a man may bee certainely and particularly assured of the remission of sinnes and of life euerlasting and therefore by this faith a man may bee certainly and particularly assured of the remission of sinnes and life euerlasting that this reason may bee of force two things must bee prooued first that true faith is a certaine assurance of god mercie to that partie in whom it is secondly that faith is a particular assurance thereof for the first that faith is a certaine assurance christ saith to peter matthew o thou of little faith wherefore diddest thou doubt where he makes an opposition betweene faith and doubting whereby giuing vs directly to vnderstand that to be certaine and to giue assurance is of the nature of faith rom paul saith of abraham that he did not doubt of the promise of god through vnbeleefe but was strengthened in faith and gaue glorie to god beeing fully assured that hee which had promised was able to doe it where i obserue first that doubting is made a fruit of vnbeleefe and therfore vnfallible certainty and assurance being contrary to doubting must needes proceede from true faith considering that contrary effects come of contrary causes and contrary causes produce contrarie effects secondly i note that the strength of abrahams faith did stand in fulnes of assurance for the text saith hee was strengthened in the faith beeing fully assured and againe heb true sauing faith is said to bee the ground and subsistence of things hoped for and the euidence or demonstration of things that are not seene but faith can be no ground or euidence of things vnles it bee for nature certaintie it selfe and thus the first point is manifest the second that sauing faith is a particular assurance is proued by this that the property of faith is to apprehend and applie the promise and the thing promised christ with his benefits ioh as many saith saint john as receiued him to them he gaue power to be the sonnes of god namely to them that beleeue in his name in these words to beleeue in christ and to receiue christ are put for one and the same thing now to receiue christ is to apprehend and applie him with all his benefits vnto our selues as he is offered in the promises of the gospell for in the sixt chapter following first of all he sets forth himselfe not only as a redeemer generallie but also as the bread of life and the water of life secondly he sets forth his best hearers as eaters of his bodie and drinkers of his blood and thirdly he intends to prooue this conclusion that to eate his bodie and to drinke his blood and to beleeue in him are all one now then if christ be as foode and if to eate and drinke the bodie and blood of christ be to beleeue in him then must there be a proportion betweene eating and beleeuing looke then as there can be no eating without taking or receiuing of meate so no beleeuing in christ without a spirituall receiuing and apprehending of him and as the bodie hath his hand mouth and stomacke whereby it taketh receiueth and digesteth meate for the nourishment of euery part so likewise in the soule there is a faith which is both hand mouth and stomacke to apprehend receiue and applie christ and all his merits for the nourishment of the soule and paul saith yet more plainely that through aith we receiue the promise of the spirit gal now as the propertie of apprehending and applying of christ belongeth to faith so it agreeth not to hope loue confidence or any other gift or grace of god but first by aith wee must apprehend christ and applie him to our selues before we can haue any hope or confidence in him and this applying seemes not to be done by any affection of the will but by a supernaturall act of the mind which is to acknowledge set downe and beleeue that remission of sinnes and life euerlasting by the merit of christ belong to vs particularly to this which i haue saide agreeth augustine why preparest thou teeth and bellie beleeue and thou hast eaten and tract how shall i reach my hand into heauen that i may hold him sitting there send vp thy faith and thou la est holde on him and bernard saith homil in cant where he is thou canst not come now yet goe to follow him and seeke him beleeue and thou hast found him for to beleeue is to find chrysost on mark homil let vs beleeue and we see iesus present before vs ambr on luke lib cap by faith christ is touched by faith christ is seene tertul de resurrect carnis he must be chewed by vnderstanding and be digested by faith reason ii whatsoeuer the holy ghost testifieth vnto vs that we may yes that we must certainely by faith beleeue but the holy ghost doth particularly testifie vnto vs our adoption the remission of our sinnes and the saluation of our soules and therefore wee may and must particularly and certainely by faith beleeue the same the first part of this reason is true and cannot be denied of any the second part is prooued thus saint paul saith rom we haue not receiued the spirit of bondage to feare but the spirit of adoption whereby we crie abba father adding further that the same spirit beareth witnesse with our spirits that we are the children of god where the apostle maketh two witnesses of our adoption the spirit of god and our spirits that is the conscience sanctified by the holy ghost the papists to elude this reason alleadge that the spirit of god doth indeede witnesse of our adoption by some comfortable feelings of god loue and fauour being such as are weake and oftentimes deceitfull but by their leaues the testimonie of the spirit is more then a bare sense or feeling of god grace for it is called the pledge and earnest of god spirit in our hearts corinthian and therefore it is fit to take away all occasion of doubting of our saluation as in a bargaine the earnest is giuen betweene the parties to put all out of question bernard saith that the testimonie of the spirite is a most sure testimonie epistle reason iii that which we must pray for by god commandement that we must beleeue but euery man is to pray for the pardon of his owne sinnes and for life euerlasting of this there is no question therfore he is bound to beleeue the same the proposition is most of all doubtfull but it is proued thus in euery petition there must be two things a desire of the things we aske and a particular faith whereby we beleeue that the thing we aske shall be giuen vnto vs so christ saith whatsoeuer ye desire when you pray beleeue that you shall haue it and it shall be giuen vnto you and s john further noteth out this particular faith calling it our assurance that god will giue vnto vs whatsoeuer we aske according to his will and hence it is that in euery petition there must be two grounds a commaundement to warrant vs in making a petition and a promise to assure vs of the accomplishment thereof and vpon both these followes necessarily an application of the things we aske to our selues reason iiii whatsoeuer god commandeth in the gospell that a man must and can performe but god in the gospell commandeth vs to beleeue the pardon of our owne sinnes and life euerlasting and therefore we must beleeue thus much and may be assured thereof this proposition is plaine by the distinction of the commandements of the law and of the gospell the commandements of the law shew vs what we must doe but minister no power to performe the thing to be done but the doctrine and commaundements of the gospell doe otherwise and therefore they are called spirit and life god with the commaundement giuing grace that the thing prescribed may be done now this is a commandement of the gospell to beleeue remission of sinnes for it was the substance of christs ministery repent and beleeue the gospell and that is not generally to beleeue that christ is a sauiour and that the promises made in him are true for so the diuels beleeue with trembling but it is particularly to beleeue that christ is my sauiour and that the promises of saluation in christ belong in speciall to me as saint john saith this is his commaundement that we beleeue in the name of iesus christ now to beleeue in christ is to put confidence in him which none can doe vnlesse he be first assured of his loue and fauour and therefore in as much as we are enioyned to put our confidence in christ we are also enioyned to beleeue our reconciliation with him which stands in the remission of our sins and our acceptation to life euerlasting reason v whereas the papists teach that a man may be assured of his saluation by hope euen hence it followes that he may be vnfalliblie assured therof for the property of true and liuely hope is neuer to make a man ashamed rom and true hope followeth faith and euer presupposeth certeintie of faith neither can any man truly hope for his saluation vnlesse by faith he be certeinly assured thereof in some measure exception i the popish doctors take exception to these reasons on this manner first they say it cannot be proued y a man is as certaine of saluation by faith as he is of the articles of the creed i answere first they proue thus much that we ought to be as cert ine of the one as of the other for looke what commandement we haue to beleeue the articles of our faith the like we haue inio ning vs to beleeue the pardon of our owne sins as i haue proued secondly these arguments proue it to be the nature or essential property of faith as certeinly to assure man of his saluation as it doth assure him of the articles which he beleeueth and howsoeuer commonly man do not beleeue their saluation as vnfallible as they do their articles of faith yet some speciall man doe hauing god word applied by the spirit as a sure ground of their faith whereby they beleeue their owne saluation as they haue it for a ground of the articles of their faith thus certeinly was abraha assured of his owne saluation as also the prophets and apostles and the martyrs of god in all ages whereupon without doubting they haue bin content to lay downe their liues for the name of christ in whom they were assured to receiue eternall happines and there is no question but there be many now that by long and often experience of god mercy and by the inward certificate of the holy ghost haue attained to full assurance of their saluation ii exception howsoeuer a man may be assured of his present estate yet no man is certeine of his perseuerance vnto the end ans it is otherwise for in the sixt petition lead vs not into temptation we pray that god would not suffer vs to be wholy ouercome of the diuell in any temptation and to this petition we haue a promise answerable corinthian that god with temptation will giue an issue and therefore howsoeuer the diuell may buffit molest and wound the servant of god yet shall he neuer be able to ouercome them againe hee that is once a member of christ can neuer be wholy cut off and if any by sinne were wholy seuered from christ for a time in his recouery he is to be baptized the second time for baptisme is the sacrament of initiation or ingrafting into christ by this reason we should as often be baptized as we fall into any sinne which is absurd againe saint john saith john they went out from vs but they were not of vs for if they had been of vs they would haue continued with vs where he taketh it for graunted that such as be once in christ shall neuer wh ly bee seuered or fall from him though our communion with christ may be lessened yet the vnion and the bond of coniunction can neuer be dissolued iii exception they say we are indeede to beleeue our saluation on god part but wee must needes doubt in regard of our selues because the promises of remission of sinnes are giuen vpon condition of mans faith and repentance now we cannot say they be assured that we haue true faith and repentance because we may lie in secret sinnes and so want that indeed which we suppose our selues to haue answer i say againe he that doth truly repent and beleeue doth by god grace know that he doth repent and beleeue for else paul would neuer haue said prooue your selues whether you be in the faith or not and the same apostle saith corinthian we haue not receiued the spirit of the world but the spirit which is of god that we might know the things which are giuen of god which things are not onely life euerlasting but iustification sanctification and such like and as for secret sinnes they cannot make our repentance void for he that truly repenteth of his knowne sinnes repenteth also of such as be vnknowne and receiueth the pardon of them all god requireth not an expresse or speciall repentance of vnknowne sinnes but accepts it as sufficient if we repent of them generally as dauid saith psalm who knowes the errors of this life forgiue me my secret sinnes and whereas they adde that faith and repentance must be sufficient i answere that the sufficiencie of our faith and repentance stands in the trueth and not in the measure or perfection thereof and the trueth of both where they are is certainely discerned reason vi the iudgement of the auncient church de verbis de sermon august of an euill servant thou article made a good child therefore presume not of thine owne doing but of the grace of christ it is not arrogancie but faith to acknowledge what thou hast receiued is not pride but deuotion and tract in epistle ioh let no man aske another man but returne to his owne heart if he finde charitie there he hath securitie for his passage from life to death hilar in matth the kingdome of heauen which our lord professed to be in himselfe his will is that it must be hoped for without any doubtfulnesse of vncertaintie will at all otherwise there is no iustification by faith if faith it selfe be made doubtfull bernard in his epistle who is the iust man but he that being loued of god loues him againe which comes not to passe but by the spirit reuealing by faith the eternall purpose of god of his saluation to come which reuelation is nothing else but the infusion of spirituall grace by which when the deedes of the flesh are mortified the man is prepared to the kingdome of heauentogether receiuing in one spirit that whereby he may presume that he is loued and also loue againe to conclude the papists haue no great cause to dissent from vs in this poynt for they teach and professe that they doe by a speciall faith beleeue their owne saluation certainely and vnfallibly in respect of god that promiseth now the thing which hindreth them is their owne indisposition and vnworthinesse as they say which keepes them from being certaine otherwise then in a likely hope but this hinderance is easily remoued if man will iudge indifferently for first of all in regard of our selues and our disposition we cannot be certaine at all but must despaire of saluation euen to the very death we cannot bee sufficiently disposed so long as wee liue in this world but must alwaies say with iacob i am lesse then all thy mercies gen and with dauid enter not into iudgement with thy servant o lord for none liuing shall bee iustified in thy sight and with the centurion lord i am not worthie that thou shouldest come vnder my roofe matth secondly god in making promise of saluation respects not mens worthines for he chose vs to life euerlasting when we were not hee redeemed vs from death being enemy and intitles vs to the promise of saluation if we acknowledge our selues to be sinners matth if wee labour and trauaile vnder the burden of them matth if we hunger and thirst after grace ioh and these things we may certenly and sensibly perceiue in our selues and when we finde them in vs though our vnworthinesse be exceeding great it should not hinder our assurance for god makes manifest his power in our weakenesse corinthian and he will not breake the bruised reede nor quench the smoking flaxe isai thirdly if a man loue god for his mercies sake and haue a true hope of saluation by christ he is in christ and hath fellowship with him and he that is in christ hath all his vnworthines and wants laid on christ and they are couered and pardoned in his death and in respect of our selues thus considered as we are in christ wee haue no cause to wauer but to be certaine of our saluation and that in regard of our selues the catholikes say we are indeed to beleeue our saluation on god part who is desirous of all mens saluation very rich in mercy and able to saue vs but our feare riseth in regard of our selues because the promises of remission of sinnes depend vpon our true repentance vnlesse you doe penance yee shall all perish and the promises of saluation are made vpon condition of keeping god commaundements if thou wilt enter into life keepe the commaundements againe no man shall be crovvned except he combat lavvfullie novv vve not knovving vvhether vve shall vvell performe these things required by god at our hands haue iust cause to feare least god doe not on his part performe that which he promiseth vpon such conditions m perkins answereth that for faith and true repentance euery man that hath them knoweth well that he hath them to which i replie that for faith being rightly taken it may be knowne of the party that hath it because it is a light of the vnderstanding and so being like a lampe may be easily seene but true repentance requires besides faith both hope and charity which are seated in the darke corners of the will and cannot by faith be seene in themselues but are knowne by their effects which being also vncertaine do make but coniectures and a probable opinion your replie is nothing but a bare deniall of that which master perkins answered whereas you should haue disproued it there is no lesse doubt of faith than of repentance by your owne reason for that also hath it seate in the will being a resting or relying vpon god for saluation by christ the effects both of the one and of the other are as certainly discerned by a christian as ordinarie trust in man and worldly sorrow by a naturall man so that place of s paul may be omitted where he saith proue your selues vvhether you be in saith or no because we accord that it may be tried by vs whether we haue faith or no although i know well that s pauls words carry a farre different sense but let that passe as impertinent it is not amisse for you to haue it omitted because it corinthian makes so plainly against you the apostle speaking there of such a faith as necessarily hath hope and charitie ioyned with it when you shew another sense you shall haue another answere to the other that vve haue receiued the spirit vvhich is of god that vve might knovv the things vvhich are giuen of god what things these are which the spirit reuealeth to vs s paul teacheth in the same place that vvhich the eye hath not seene nor eare hath heard ampc god hath prepared for them that loue him but to vs god hath reuealed by his spirit all this is true but who they be that shall attaine to that blessed banquet by god so prepared god onely knoweth and by his spirit reuealeth it to very few and will you learne out of s ierome that auncient doctor the cause why therefore saith he it is put ambiguous and left vncertaine that vvhile man are doubtfull of their saluation they may doe penance more manfully and so may moue god to take compassion on them an other reason of this vncertaintie yeeldeth s augustine in these words in this place of temptation such is our infirmity that assurednes might engender pride to this agreeth s gregorie saying if vve knovv our selues to haue grace vve are proud so that to strike downe the pride of our harts and to humble vs and to make vs trauaile more carefully in the workes of mortification god doth not ordinarily assure man at the first of their owne saluation but to cheere vp their harts on the otherside doth put them in great hope of it like to a discreet and good lord who will not at the first entrance into his seruice infeafe his servant in the fee simpleof those lands which after vpon his good deserts he meaneth to bestow on him the things corinthian there spoken of are by the spirit of god made knowne to true christians not only that they are prepared for some but that they themselues haue their part in them neither doth s hierome say any thing to the contrarie but only shewes that god doth not giue man knowledge how hee will deale with them concerning outward punishment because he would haue them the more earnest to repent and crie for mercie it is saftie he speakes of such as the niniuites obtained by prayer and fasting not euerlasting saluation but let it be vnderstood of euerlasting life none of these ancient writers say that either we ought not or cannot be assured by faith of our saluation but onely thus much may be concluded out of them that the measure of our assurance is not perfect to the end we may be more carefull to pray for pardon and in lesse danger of being puft vp this is another kind of doctrine then that which m perkins in his last supplie deliuereth to witte that if vve regard our ovvne indiseosition vve must dispaire because vve be not vvorthy of his mercy not so good sir because we know that he bestoweth mercy vpon the vnvvorthie at the first iustification of a sinner but will not admit into the kingdome of heauen any vnworthy but giues man grace while they liue to worke that they are made worthy of his heauenly kingdome according to that they shall vvalke vvith me in vvhites because they are vvorthy but of this more fully in the chapter of merits master perkins speakes not of vnworthines onely but of indisposition also which is a reason to make euery one despaire in regard of himselfe though in respect of god mercie he may conceiue some hope for if no man should find fauour but he that is disposed or fitted for it perfectly sure wee must needes despaire of attaining to that fitnes how can we in respect of that looke for saluation the worthines which is in them that shall come to heauen is both in christ by whom they are worthie as members of his mysticall bodie and also in themselues who departing out of this world are made perfectly righteous by inherent righteousnes which before was begun in them if god bidde vs pray that we fall not into temptation and promiseth an issue forth then the assurance depends vpon prayer and not vpon our former faith what then if wee doe not pray so as we should may not the enemy then not only wound but kill vs to it cannot be denied and therein as in diverse other workes of pietie many haue been too too slacke as the pitifull fall of thousands haue taught vs master perkins doth not say that prayer doth assure vs of perseuerance but that wee resting vpon god by faith and calling on him are vpheld from falling away not because our prayer is for the manner and measure such as it ought to be for all should be perfect but because god hath promised to keepe his children and that he may fulfill his promise stirres them vp to pray according to his will though with many imperfections oh saith m perkins it cannot be that he vvhich vvas once a member of christ can euer after be vvholy cut off o shamelesse assertion and contrary to many plaine texts and examples of holy scriptures doth not our sauiour say in expresse words that euery braunch in me not bearing f he vvill take it avvay and againe if any abide not in me he shall be cast forth as the branch and shall vvither and be cast into the fire which doth demonstrate that some which were members of christ be wholie cut off and that for euer are we not by faith made members of christ by our aduersaries owne confession and doth not our blessed sauiour say expounding the parable of the sower that the seed vvhich fell vpon the rocke doth signifie them vvho vvith ioy receiue the vvord and these saith he haue no roote but for a time they beleeue and in time of temptation reuolt doth not s paul in expresse tearmes say that some hauing faith and good conscience expelling good conscience haue made shipvvrack of their faith of whom were by name hymenaeus and alexander the like that in the last daies some should reuolt from the faith againe that some for couetousnes sake had erred from the saith doe you call that a shamelesse assertion which is so oft auowed by our sauiour himselfe ioh he that drinkes of that water that i shall giue him shall neuer thirst but it shall be in him a well of water springing vp to euerlasting life againe ioh my sheepe heare my voyce and i know them and they follow me and i giue them eternall life and they shall neuer perish neither shall any plucke them out of my hand and in another place ioh verse i am the bread of life he that comes to me shall not hunger and he that beleeues in me shall neuer thirst this is the will of him that sent me that euery one that sees the son and beleeues in him should haue euerlasting life and i will raise him vp at the last day now the places you alleage prooue no more but that if any man fall away from christ he shall perish and that some may forsake the truth of doctrine or hauing had some shew of a iustifying faith for a time may afterward manifest themselues not to haue beleeued in christ to iustification of the former kinde are those two places of john of the latter all the rest and for example amongst other take saul the first king of israell who was at his election as the holy ghost witnesseth so good a man that there vvas no better then he in jsraell and yet became reprobate as is in the scripture signified the like is probable of salomon and in the new testament of judas the traytour and simon magus whom s luke saith that he also himselfe beleeued and after became an arch heretike and so died the like almost may be verified of all arch heretikes who before they fell were of the faithfull that you say of saul is vtterly false for the scripture neither in that text nor any where else speakes so of him and indeed how could it samuel being then aliue so holie and good a man but the place you meane is in sam the ninth chapter where samuel saith to him whose shall all the best things of israel be as your translation reades it that is saith cuius enim optima quaeque israel lyra ibi your glosse the dignitie of the king who may take the best things of the people subiect to him the goodly things saith the all that is to be desired pagnin what soeuer is to expedibile pagnin vatablns be desired in israel saith vatablus and in his marginall note all the desire of israel as if he should say thou shalt be king of israel and this agrees both with the word and with the context care not for the asses saith samuel for they are found and besides whose shall all the wealth of israel be thus haue you graced saul and belied the holy ghost so haue you disgraced salomon whom the holy ghost honored with speaking by his mouth and writing by his penne the great mysteries of god euery papist hath not power like the pope to make whom he will a saint and whom he list a reprobate iudas simon hymeneus alexander and the rest beleeued the truth of the gospell at least in part for a time but neuer any one of these had at any time true iustifying faith to rest vpon christ for saluation but what neede we further proofe of this matter seeing that this is cosen german if not the very same with one of that infamous heretike iouinians erronious articles condemned and registred by s hierome and s augustine who held that iust man after baptisme could not sin and if they did sinne they were indeed washed with water but neuer receiued the spirit of grace his ground was that he which had once receiued the spirit of grace could not sinne after which is iust m perkins proposition so that to vphold an errour he falleth into an old condemned heresie we denie not that a man may sinne yes we confesse that the very best man doe sinne but wee say the lord by his spirit keepes them that are iustified from falling away from christ either finally or totally iac he that is borne of god sinneth not for his seed remaineth in him neither can he sinne because he is borne of god and which is yet more absurd in the next confirmation he letteth slippe at once a brace of other heresies these be his words and if by sin one vvere vvhol seuered from christ for a time in his recouery he is to be baptised the second time where you haue first rebaptizing which is the principall error of the anabaptists and withall the heresie of the nouatians who held that if any in persecution denied christ after baptisme there was no remedy left in god church for their recouery but must be left to god so saith m perkins for that of rebaptizing he seemes to bring in ex absurdo so that the common saying is verified in him one absurdity being graunted a thousand follovv after but doth he know no other meanes then baptisme to recouer one cut off from christ hath he forgotten that corrupted sentence of the prophet wherwith they begin their common prayer vvhat houre soeuer a sinner doth repent him of his sinne ampc with them repentance and with vs the sacrament of penance serue a man at any time of his life to be reconciled to christ article part article f baptisme being the sacrament of imitating and ingrafting man into christ must needes be equally necessarie for all that are out of christ as for repentance vpon which god forgiues a sinner it is common to the baptized with the vnbaptized now you hold it needfull at the first as doubtlesse it is so that the wilfull neglect of it is damnable though a man haue repented why should it be needlesse afterward when a man is wholy out of christ as in the beginning he was your superstitious and proud satisfactorie penance wee reiect as antichristian neither allowing any second baptisme nor excluding them that fall neuer so grieuously either from heauen or the church in this world if they repent but we must answere vnto that of s john they vvent out from vs but they vvere not of vs for if they had bin of vs they vvould haue continued vvith vs i answere if they went out from vs they were before with vs which confirmeth our assertion that man may depart from their faith and christs profession but such man were not indeed of the number of the elect of which s john was for then either they would haue continued with them in the christian faith or else by hartie repentance would haue returned vnto it backe againe which is s augustines owne exposition and these be the arguments for the catholikes vvhich m perkins through his confused order toucheth here and there who denies they were with the church or who can prooue they were of it you grant as much as we desire that they were not of the elect who onely are in case to fall away from christ because the rest were neuer in him their returning by repentance is not into christs mysticall body as if they had been out of it article part article c but either into the congregation of the faithfull or into god fauour in respect of their owne feeling to which i vvill adde one taken out of the words of s paul but thou by faith dost stand be not too highly vvise but feare if god hath not spared the naturall boughes lest perhaps he vvill not spare thee neither and againe vvorke your saluation vvith feare and trembling there be aboue an hundred such texts in holy vvrite vvherein the holy ghost exhorteth vs to stand in feare of our saluation out of vvhich i thus frame my argument no man must stand in feare of that of vvhich he is by faith assured but the faithfull must stand in feare of their saluation ergo they bee not assured of it by saith the minor or second proposition is plainly proued by these places cited before the major is manifest there is no feare in faith he that feareth vvhether the thing be assured or no cannot giue a certaine assent thereunto dubius in side in fidelis est put the case in another article to make it more euident he that feareth vvhether there be a god or no doe vve esteeme that he beleeueth in god so he that feareth vvhether iesus christ be god is he a christian hath he a true faith you must needs anssvere no so he that feareth vvhether he shall be saued or no can haue no faith of his saluation i may grant your conclusion the faithfull article part article amp part article are not ordinarily assured of their saluation by such a faith as hath no doubting annexed vnto it yet is our assertion true that they are assured of it by such a faith as shall neuer deceiue them and againe yet they ought to be assured without doubting but i will answere to your syllogisme first by distinguishing on your proposition no man must nor indeed can stand in feare of that of which he is assured by such a measure of faith as admits no doubt but his faith being weake he may and must for this feare is an especiall meanes to keepe him from falling away in which respect the holy ghost exhorts to it by reason our faith is not perfect secondly for your assumption i say the faithfull are not simply willed to be afraid that they shall not be saued but onely are appointed to vse the meanes of securing of themselues by warines because else it will come to passe that they shall fall away in their owne sense and feeling your example prooues nothing the measure of faith being so diverse and further hee may truly beleeue in god that in some temptation falles into doubting for a time whether there be a god or no as you must needes know if you haue any experience of the temptations which sometimes befall the deare children of god to these inuincible reasons grounded vpon god word let vs ioyne some plaine testimonies taken aswell out of the holy scripture as out of the auncient fathers first what can be more manifest to warrant vs that the faithfull haue not assurance infallible of their saluation then these words of the holy ghost there be iust and therefore faithfull and vvise man and their vvorkes be in the hand of god and neuerthelesse a man doth not knovv vvhether he be worthy of hatred er loue but all things are kept vncertaine for the time to come where is then the protestant certainety and because one heretike cauilleth against the laten translation saying that a word or two of it may be otherwise turned heare how s ierome who was most cunning in the hebrew text doth vnderstand it the sense is saith he j haue sound the vvorkes of iust man to be in the hand of god and yet themselues not to knovv vvhether they be loued of god or no whether there be cause or no to finde fault with the translation let any man iudge that either vnderstands the hebrew chaldee and greeke or will looke vpon other interpretations of pa nin vatablus arias m ntanus your owne man for the sense our interpretation is confirmed by the course of the text that a man cannot know by the outward things that befall him here whether he be loued of god or hated because these happen alike both to the elect and to the reprobate hee that will reade the expositions of learned man and weigh the likelihood of their reasons shall see that the place is not cleere enough to prooue a controuersie an other plaine testimony is taken out of s paul where he sheweth that it is not in vs to iudge of our owne iustice but we must aue to god the iudgement of it these be the words i am not guiltie in conscience of any thing but i am not iustified herein but he that iudgeth me is our lord therefore iudge not before the time vntill our lord doe come vvho also vvill lighten the hidden things of darknes and vvill manifest the counsell of the hart and then the praise shall be to euery man of god so that before god iudgement by s pauls testimony man may not assure themselues of their owne iustice much lesse of their saluation how innocent soeuer they find themselues in their owne consciences see vpon this place s ambrose s basill th doret on this place who all agree that man may haue secret faults which god only seeth and therefore they must liue in feare and alwaies pray to be deliuered from them if all you say be granted it is nothing to vs for wee doe not fetch our assurance from the perfection of our righteousnes but from the truth of our faith neither denie wee that a man hath many secret slips knowne to god onely but we say he may be assured of his saluation for all these vpon which it doth not depend wee acknowledge with those worthie man that we must call vpon god for pardon of our secret sinnes with feare and humblenes of minde for the rest let s augustines testimony whom our aduersaries acknovvledge to be the most diligent and faithfull register of all antiquitie be sufficient this most iudicious and holy father thus defineth this matter as long as vve liue here vve our selues cannot iudge of our selues i doe not say vvhat vve shall be to morrovv but vvhat vve are to day and yet more directly albeit holy man are certaine of the revvard of their perseuerance yet of their ovvne perseuerance they are found vncertaine for vvhat man can knovv that he shall perseuere and hold on in the action and encrease of iustice vntill the end vnlesse by some reuelation he be assured of it from him vvho of his iust but secret iudgement doth not enforme all man of this matter but deceiueth none so no iust man is assured of his saluation by his ordinary faith by extraordinary reuelation some man may be assured the rest are not which is iust the catholike sentence austin speakes not aug de verbis dom sermon misquoted for aug homil homil there of the assurance of saluation but perswades man to giue no credit to flatterers because we our selues cannot iudge of our selues and indeede wee are oftentimes faultie in those things wherein wee suppose we haue done very well in aug de ciuit dei lib c the other place he denies that knowledge which is wholy without doubting and to which wee grant few or none attaine ordinarily and because s bernard is by our aduersaries cited for them in this point take his testimony in as precise tearmes as any catholike at this time speaketh thus he vvriteth vvho can say i am one of the elect i am one of the predestinat to life i am one of the number of the children vvho i say can thus say the scripture crying out against him a man knovveth not vvhether he be vvorthy of loue or hatred therefore vve haue no certeinty but the confidence of hope doth comfort vs that vve be not vexed at all with the perplexitie of this doubt the vvord of god according to s bernard cryeth out against all them that certeinly assure themselues of their saluation vvhereon then doe they build their faith that beleeue it bernard was by profession a member of the popish church and therefore against vs his testimonie is nothing but against you it is of great weight for the point in question first he is of opinion sermon in sep ages in that place by you quoted that a quales sumus nosse possumus vel ex pa te man may know in what estate he is for the present at least in part because god hath giuen certaine manifest signes and tokens of saluation vt indub bile sit that it cannot be doubted but that he is in the number of the elect in whom those signes shall continue secondly the reason why he denies the latter is because y e signes he speaks of being in outward obedience principally may faile and so breede some cause of doubting the ecclesiastes scripture he alleageth for the ground of his vncertaintie hath nothing in it to that purpose if it may be permitted to ioyne moderne opinions vvith auncient bad man vvith good i could proue by the testimony of euery principall sect of this time that all other sectaries vvere deceiued in this their persvvasion of their saluation for both lutherans caluinists and anabaptists to omit the rest doe hold euery one of themselues assured of their saluation and yet each sect holdeth euery one not of his ovvne band assured of damnation so that by the sentence of the lutherans all caluinists and anabaptists are miserably deceiued vvhen they assure themselues of their saluation in like manner if the anabaptists be true censurers both lutherans and caluinists and all other not of their heresie erre fouly vvhen they beare themselues in hand that they shall be saued certaine it is therefore by the consent of all the vvorld that very many vvho assure themselues of saluation are indeed assured of damnation how doth your conclusion belong to this question very many who to assure themselues of saluation are assured of damnation who denies it but the course you take in comming to it is out of the way of truth let all anabaptists passe whom caluin bulling we not you haue from time to time confuted till of late you began to tread vpon them when we had beaten them downe caluinists and lutherans as you maliciously call them agree in this point for the most part and neither make any question but the other may be saued for all their differences in some opinions but both haue very iust cause to doubt of you who fight against the maine foundation as in the next article with the testimonies of the auncient doctors for vs i pray thee gentle reader conferre those vvhich m perkins in his sixt reason alleadgeth against vs first s augustine in these vvords of an euill servant thou article made a good child therefore presume not of thine owne doing but of the grace of christ jt is not arrogancy but faith to acknovvledge vvhat thou hast receiued it is not pride but d u tion what vvord is here of certeinty of saluation but that it belongeth to a faithfullman to confesse himselfe much bound to god for calling of him to be his which euery christian must doe hoping himselfe so to be and being most certeine that if he be not in state of grace it is long of himselfe and no vvant on god part the second place hath not so much as any shevv of vvords for him thus he speaketh let no man aske another man but returne to his owne hart and if he find charity there he hath security for his passage from life to death what need vvas there to seeke charity in his hart fer security of his saluation if his faith assured him thereof therefore this text maketh flat against him there is this for certaintie of saluation that it is no presumption or a man to know he hath receiued the grace of christ it is not arrogancie but faith not pride but deuotion whereas you say it is presumption arrogancie and pride can any thing be more contrarie not so much as a shew of words yet is there substance of matter for if charitie be a securitie for passage from life to death and if a man may know whether it be in his heart or no doubtlesse there is assurance of saluation to be had but you will say not by faith else what neede he seeke for charitie as if it were amisse to haue more proofes than one he that hath tried the diuels temptations knowes that all is little enough but this assurance by charitie is assurance by faith because it prooues wee haue such a faith as shall certainly bring vs to euerlasting life the next author he citeth is s hilarie in these words the kingdome of heauen which our lord professed to be in himselfe his vvill is that it be hoped for vvithout any doubtfulnes of vncertaine vvill at all is an addition othervvise there is no iustification by faith if faith it selfe be made doubtfull first he saith but as we say that the kingdome of heauen is to be hoped for without any doubtfulnes for we professe certainty of hope and deny only certainty of faith as m perkins confesseth before and as for faith we say with him also it is not doubtfull but very certaine what maketh this to the purpose that a man must beleeue his owne saluation when s hilary speaketh there of faith of the resurrection of the dead hilar in math ca spes bonorum aeternorum hilary requires such a hope as is grounded vpon faith and hath the same nature with faith but that it particularly respects the time to come whereas faith rests absolutely vpon god for the present also neither speakes hee of the resurrection from the dead in particular but of euery mans trust concerning his own enioying of all heauenlie felicitie his last author is s bernard vvho is the iust man but he that be g loued of god loues him againe vvhich comes not to pass but by the s t reuealing by faith the eternall saith perk ns out of bernard promise of god of his saluation to come vvhich reuelation is nothing else but the infusion of spirituall grace by vvhich the deeds of the flesh are mortified the man is prepared to the kingdome of heauen togither receiuing in one spirit that whereby he may presume that he is loued and loues againe note that he saith the reuelation of the spirit to be nothing else but the infasion of spirituall graces and comfort whereby a man hath some feeling of god goodnesse towards him by which as he saith he may presume but not beleeue certainely that he is loued of god but let s bernard in the same place interpret himself there he speaketh thus as i cited once before it is giuen to man to tast before hand somewhat of the blisse to come ampc of the which knowledge of our selues novv in part perceiued a man doth in the meane season glorie in hope but not yet in security his opinion then is expressely that for all the reuelations of the spirit made by faith vnto vs we are not assured for certainty of our saluation but feele great ioy through the hope we haue hereafter to receiue it would bernard haue a man presume that god loues him without warrant or would he haue him not beleeue the testimonie of the spirit which assures him of that loue by such a pledge aug de verb dom sermon austin taught vs before that it is no arrogancie but faith to know what we haue receiued and bernard teacheth vs now that the end of receiuing is that we may presume we are beloued of god that is that wee may know it by faith he addes further afterward that this is the holy and secret counsell of god which the son hath receiued from the father by the holy ghost and communicates to those that be his so that they begin to know as they are knowne it being granted to them to feele before hand somwhat of their blessednes to come as it hath been hidden from all eternitie in him that did predestinate and shall appeare more fully in him in beatificante when he shall make vs blessed we beleeue with bernard that we haue here but a taste of the ioy to come and that our securitie is not ordinarily without doubting so that the certaintie he speakes of and that we say christians haue is all one this passage of testimonies being dispatched let vs now come vnto the fiue other reasons which m perkins produceth in defence of their opinion the first reason is this that in faith there are two things the one is an insallible assurance of those things which vve beleeue this we grant and there hence proue as you heard before that there can be no faith of our particular saluation because we be not so fully assured of that but that we must stand in feare of losing of it according to that hold that which thou hast least perhaps another receiue thy crovvne faith in it selfe is a full assurance but hath not this full worke in euery one that truly beleeues and therefore your proofe is insufficient but the second point of faith puts all out of question for saith m perkins it doth assure vs of remissission of our sinnes and of life euerlasting in particular proue that sir and we need no more it is proued out of s john as many as receiued him he gaue them poeer to be made the sonnes of god namely to them that beleeue in his name this text commeth much too short he gaue them power to be the sonnes that is gaue them such grace that they were able and might if they would be sonnes of god but did not assure them of that neither much lesse that they should so continue vnto their liues end i omit his vnsauoury discourse of eating and beleeuing christ and applying vnto vs his benefits which he might be ashamed to make vnto vs that admit no part of it to be true i confesse that therein faith hath his part if it be ioyned with charity and frequentation of the sacraments master perkins proues that faith is a particular assurance because it is a particular applying of christ by euery man to himselfe that it is so he shewes in that it is a receiuing of christ and all his benefits the place of ioh john is brought to proue that to beleeue in christ and to receiue christ is all one to which your answere is altogether impertinent so also is your exposition false for the holy ghost speakes not of a not power to be the sonnes of god but of a priuiledge whereby all true beleeuers are the sonnes of god ye are all saith the gal apostle the sonnes of god by faith in christ iesus that discourse so vnsauourie to your corrupt taste serues to manifest this point that to receiue or beleeue in christ is to applie him particularly as meate and drinke are applied by eating and drink if you could as easily haue disproued as disliked that discourse we should haue seene the one as we haue the other this is it which s paul teacheth that not by the vvorkes of moses law but by faith in christ iesus vve receiue the promises of the spirit and shall haue hereafter the performance if we obserue those things which christ hath commaunded vs but what is this to certeintie of saluation s paul speakes of receiuing the spirit by faith and no where vouchsafes any such priuiledge to workes which indeed haue not to doe in that matter gal receiued ye the spirit by the workes of the law or by the hearing of faith to those of augustine and such like authorities i answere that we find christ we hold christ we see christ by faith beleeuing him to be the son of god and redeemer of the world and iudge of the quicke and the dead and we vnderstand and disgest all the mysteries of this holy word but where is it once said in any of these sentences that we are assured of our saluation we beleeue all these points and many more but we shall be neuer the neare our saluation vnlesse we obserue god commandements the servant vvhich knovves his masters will and doth it not shall be beaten vvith many stripes then you are my friends saith our sauiour when you shall doe the things which i commaund you which we being vncerteine to performe assure not our selues of his friendship but when to our knowledge we goe as neare it as we can and demaund pardon of our wants we liue in good hope of it you seeme to grant as much concerning these places of austin as master perkins desires but that you restraine this beleeuing against austins words to a beleefe of the truth whereas the vse of eating and drink christ is not onely to establish our iudgement but also and that principally to confirme the assurance of our saluation by his death and sacrifice it is a strange kinde of answering to require the maine conclusion in euery pro syllogisme and not to vnderstand to what purpose euery seuerall reason is alleaged the beleeuing of neuer so many points brings neither assurance nor saluation but the resting vpon christ for saluation giues vs assurance that wee are the children of god and shall continue so receiuing at the last the inheritance of sonnes because of our adoption not the wages of servant for our imperfect labour in which we vse our best endeuour to doe the will of our father not the taske of our master i answere first out of the place it selfe that there followeth a condition on our parts to be performed which m perkins thought wisdome to conceale for s paul saith that the spirit witnesseth with our spirits that we are the sonnes of god and coheires with christ with this condition if yet vve suffer vvith him that vve may be glorified vvith him so that the testimonie is not absolute but conditionall and then if vve faile in performance of the condition god stands free of his promise and will take his earnest backe againe and so to haue receiued the earnest of it will nothing auaile vs much lesse assure vs of saluation s paul sets downe no condition at all in rom verse the place alleaged by master perkins the next verse propounds the course that god hath appointed to bring his children to glorie which depends not vpon vs but vpon god himselfe who rom makes all his sonnes conformable to their eldest brother christ according to his predestination heb and chastice all his children by one kinde of suffering or another this is the direct answere to that place although the other be very good that the testimony of the spirit is but an inward comfort and ioy which breedeth great hope of saluation but bringeth not assurance there of this m perkins would refute by the authority of saint bernard in the place before cited see the place and my answere there the witnes of the spirit the apostle speakes of is that we are the children of god the comfort and ioy you mention is an effect arising from that testimonie of his and our feeling not the foundation of our assurance we reioyce because the spirit beares witnes that wee are the sonnes of god not contrariwise because we reioyce therefore wee haue hope that we are god children though this also be a secondarie proofe of our assurance this argument is so proper for their purpose that we returne it vpon their owne heads we must pray for saluation therefore we are not yet assured of it for who in his wits prayeth god to giue him that whereof he is assured alreadie and a godly act of faith it is in that prayer to beleeue that god wil giue that which he is assured of before hand such foolish petitions cannot please god and therefore after their doctrine it is to be denied that any faithfulman may pray for his saluation but rather thanke the lord for it but to answere directly he who prayeth must beleeue he shall obtaine that which he prayeth for if he obserue all the due circumstances of praier which be many but to this purpose two are required necessarily the one that he who prayeth be the true servant of god which first excludeth all those that erre in faith touched in these words vvhat you of the faithfull shall desire vvhen you pray shall be giuen you the other is when we request matters of such moment that we perseuere in prayer and continue our suit day by day of these suites of eternall saluation we must take these words of our sauiour to be spoken vve must alvvaies pray and neuer be vveary and to doubt but vve shall in the end receiue it but because vve are in doubt whether we shall obserue those necessary circumstances of prayerer no therefore we cannot be so well assured to obtaine our suite although we be on god part must assured that he is most b ful and readier to giue then vve are to a e i denie your consequence and answere to the proofe of it as before that article part article our faith is not without some doubting and our feeling not so strong as it should and may be if that were the condition we could neuer looke to obtaine any thing of god for wee are sure that we neuer obserue all the circumstances required but we are out of all doubt that god will grant our requests in his good time if we make them in christs name though we faile in circumstances and pray not euery day as we ought for the rom spirit we haue receiued will rouse vs vp from our deadnes and teach vs so to pray that we shall speede as it may be most for god glorie and our owne saluation but saith m perkins s john noteth out this particular faith calling it our assurance that god will giue vnto vs whatsoeuer we aske according to his vvill but vvhere find vve that it is god vvill to assure euery man at the first entrance into his seruice of eternall saluation is it not sufficient to make him an assured promise of it vpon his faithfull seruice and good behauiour tovvards him where finde you that we hold any such opinion nay we teach the contrarie that this assurance comes not at the first but by little and little as god sees it requisite according to the triall he hath appointed to make of vs but because god hath commanded vs to labour for the perfection of al graces we are sure this must be intreated for and haue promise that it shall be granted as god seeth meete both for the time and the measure of it the proposition is true yet commonly denied by all protestant for god commaunds vs to keepe his commaundements and they hold that to be impossible but to the assumption that god commaunds vs to beleeue our saluation is proued saith m perkins by these vvords repent and beleeue the gospell spectatum admissi risum teneatis amici where is it vvritten in that gospell beleeue your ovvne particular saluation thevv vs once but one cleare text for it and vve vvill beleeue it i doe beleeue in christ and hope to be saued through his mercy and merits but knovv vvell that vnlesse i keepe his words i am by him likened to a foole that built his house vpon the sanas he commands me to vvatch and pray least i fall into temptation and else vvhere vva neth me to prepare oyle to keepe my lampe burning against his comming or else i am most certaine to be shut out vvith the foolish virgin an hundred such admonitions find vve in holy scriptures to shake vs out of this security of our saluation and to make vs vigilant to preuent all temptations of the enemie and d gent to traine our selues in godly exercises of all vertue master perkins hath answered your obiection against his proposition that it is not a commandement of the gospell but of rom the law doe this and thou shalt liue his proofe is easilier laughed at than answered to beleeue saith he is particularly to acknowledge christ to be my sauiour that is to put my confidence in him for my saluation which i cannot doe vnlesse i be resolued of my reconciliation with him to this you answere not a word but barely alleage the first proofe and denie it all these things and such like our sauiour commaunds and assures me that god will inable me to the performing of them because i rest vpon him for this grace in christ hope indeed of heauen makes a man most couragiously beare out all stormes of persecution and not to be ashamed of christs crosse but to professe his faith most boldly before the most bloody tyrants of the world our harts being by charity fortified and made inuincible and this is that which the apostle teacheth in that place and saith before that the faithfull glory in the hope of the sonnes of god and doe not vaunt themselues of the certainty of their saluation this certainty of hope is great in those that haue long liued vertuously specially when they haue also endured manifold losses much disgrace great wrongs and iniuries for christs sake for he that cannot faile of his word hath promised to requite all such with an hundred fold but what is this to the certainety of faith which the protestant will haue euery man to be endued with at his first entrance into the seruice of god when as s paul in th that godly man pa takers of the holy ghost yes after they haue tasted the good word of god and the power of the world to come that is haue receiued besides faith great fauours of god spirit and felt as it were the ioyes of heauen haue after all this so fallen from god that there was small hope of their recouery he that hopes for any thing and glories in that hope must needes be ashamed of his follie and presumption if he faile to obtaine it but the children of god hope for euerlasting life and glorie in this hope of theirs now the rom apostle saith they shall not be ashamed of this hope and therefore it must needes be that they shall haue euerlasting life this interpretation your owne gloss interlin glosse auowes non facit erubes quiae impletur hope makes not a man blush because it is fulfilled and expounding that which followes of the loue of god it saith it is certaine it shall be fulfilled because we haue the spirit to pledge so doth lyra ibid lyra also interpret that hope so theodoret chrysostom theophylact theodoret so chrysostom so theophylact ampc and wherein i pray you differs this from the assurance of faith which wee teach and you condemne this growes euery day in the hearts of true beleeuers who neuer fall away though they are sometimes shaken those that the hebr apostle speakes of neuer had true faith to iustification as i will prooue otherwhere that we may see how farre we are to agree with them and where to differ first i will set downe the doctrine on both parts and secondly the maine differences wherein we are to stand against them euen to death our doctrine touching the iustification of a sinner i propound in foure rules rule i that iustification is an action of god whereby he absolueth a sinner and accepteth him to life euerlasting for the righteousnesse and merit of christ rule ii that iustification stands in two things first in the remission of sinnes by the merit of christ his death secondly in the imputation of christ his righteousnesse which is another action of god whereby he accounteth and esteemeth that righteousnesse which is in christ as the righteousnesse of that sinner which beleeueth in him by christ his righteousnesse we are to vnderstand two things first his sufferings specially in his death and passion secondly his obedience in fulfilling the law both which goe together for christ in suffering obeyed and obeying suffered and the very shedding of his blood to which our saluation is ascribed must not onely bee considered as it is passiue that is a suffering but also as it is actiue that is an obedience in which hee shewed his exceeding loue both to his father and vs and thus fulfilled the law for vs this point if some had well thought on they would not haue placed all iustification in remission of sins as they doe rule iii that iustification is from god meere mercie and grace procured onely by the merit of christ rule iv that man is iustified by faith alone because faith is that alone instrument created in the heart by the holy ghost whereby a sinner l ieth hold of christ his righteousnesse and applieth the same vnto himselfe there is neither hope nor loue nor any other grace of god within man that can do this but faith alone the doctrine of the romane church touching the iustification of a sinner is on this manner i they holde that before iustification there goes a preparation thereunto which is an action wrought partly by the holy ghost and partly by the power of naturall free will whereby a man disposeth himselfe to his owne future iustification in the preparation they consider the ground of iustification and things proceeding from it the ground is saith which they define to bee a generall knowledge whereby wee vnderstand and beleeue that the doctrine of the word of god is true things proceeding from this faith are these a sight of our sinnes a feare of hell hope of saluation loue of god repentance and such like all which when man haue attained they are then fully disposed as they say to their iustification this preparation being made then comes iustification itselfe which is an action of god whereby he maketh a man righteous it hath two parts the first and the second the first is when a sinner of an euill man is made a good man and to effect this two things are required first the pardon of sinne which is one part of the first iustification secondlie the infusion of inward righteousnesse whereby the heart is purged and sanctified and this habit of righteoutnes stands specially in hope and charitie after the first iustification followeth the second which is when a man of a good or iust man is made better and more iust and this say they may proceed from works of grace because he which is righteous by the first iustification can bring forth good works by the merit whereof hee is able to make himselfe more iust and righteous and yet they graunt that the first iustification commeth only of god mercie by the merit of christ because m perkins sets not downe well the catholikes opinion i wil helpe him out both with the preparation and iustification it selfe and that taken out of the councell of trent where the very words concerning preparation are these man are prepared and disposed to this iustice vvhen being stirred vp and helped by god grace they conceiuing faith by hearing are freely moued to vvard god beleeuing those things to be true vvhich god doth reueale and promise namely that he of his grace doth iustifie a sinner through the redemption that is in christ jesus and vvhen knowledging themselues to be sinners through the feare of god iudgments they turne themselues to consider the mercy of god are lifted vp into hope trusting that god vvill be mercifull vnto them for christs sake and beginning to loue him as the fountaine of all iustice are thereby moued vvith hatred and detestation of all sinnes finally they determine to receiue baptisme to begin a nevv life and to keepe all christs commaundements after this disposition or preparation followeth iustification and for that euery thing is best knowne by the causes of it all the causes of iustification are deliuered by the councell in the next chapter vvhich briefly are these the finall cause of the iustification of a sinner is the glory of god the glory of christ and maas ovvne iustification the efficient is god the meritorious christ jesus passions the instrumentall is the sacrament of baptisme the only formall cause is inherent iustice that is faith hope and charitie vvith the other gifts of the holy ghost povvred into a mans soule at that instant of iustification of the iustification by faith and the second iustification shall be spoken in their places so that we agree in this point that iustification commeth of the free grace of god through his infinite mercies and the merits of our sauiours passion and that all sinnes vvhen a man is iustified be pardoned him master perkins hath truly deliuered the summe of that which you set down out of the councill of trent and that more plainly for euery mans vnderstanding than it is in the councill now let vs come to the points of difference betweene vs and them touching iustification the first maine difference is in the matter thereof which shall bee seene by the answere both of protestant and papist to this one question what is the very thing that causeth a man to stand righteous before god and to be accepted to life euerlasting wee answer nothing but the righteousnesse of christ which consisteth partly in his sufferings and partly in his actiue obedience in fulfilling the rigour of the law and here let vs consider how neere the papists come to this answere and wherein they dissent consent i they graunt that in iustification sinne is pardoned by the merits of christ and that none can be iustified without remission of sinnes and that is well ii they graunt that the righteousnes whereby a man is made righteous before god commeth from christ and from christ alone iii the most learned among them say that christ his satisfaction and the merit of his death is imputed to euery sinner that doth heleeue for bellarm de iustif lib c his satisfaction before god and hitherto we agree the very point of difference is this wee hold that the satisfaction made by christ in his death and obedience to the law is imputed to vs and becomes our righteousnesse they say it is our satisfaction and not our righteousnes whereby we stand righteous before god because it is inherent in the person of christ as in a subiect now the answer of the papist to the former question is on this manner the thing saith hee that maketh vs righteous before god and causeth vs to bee accepted to life euerlasting is remission of sinnes and the habite of inward righteousnes or charitie with the fruites thereof we condesend and graunt that the habite of righteousnesse which wee call sanctification is an excellent gift of god and hath his reward of god and is the matter of our iustification before man because it serueth to declare vs to be reconciled to god and to bee iustified yet wee denie it to bee the thing which maketh vs of sinners to become righteous or iust before god the point of difference is this that the protestant hold that christs passion and obedience imputed vnto vs becommeth our righteousnes for the words of iustice and iustification they seldome vse and not any righteousnes vvhich is in our selues the cathlikes affirme that those vertues povvred into our soules speaking of the formall cause of iustification is our iustice and that through that a man is iustified in god sight and accepted to life euerlasting although as you haue seene before vve hold that god of his mecre mercy through the merits of christ iesus our sauiour hath freetie be lovved that iustice on vs the word iustification wee vse continually the cauill about our not vsing iustice but righteousnes for our aduantage is sufficiently answered by fulk against martins discouerie chap against the rhem luke doctor fulke against gregory martin and the rhemists the true reason why our translators chose rather to say righteous and righteousnes than iust and iustice was because the former words are more generall the latter for the most part restrained in common vse to one particular vertue between man and man we denie not that christians being iustified are truly righteous by inherent righteousnes but that wee are to pleade our owne imperfect righteousnes before god to our iustification note that m perkins comes to short in his second rule vvhen he attributeth the merits of christs sufferings to obedience vvhereas obedience if it had been vvithout charity vvould haue merited nothing at god hands master perkins comes as neere the marke as you acknowledging the loue of christ in his obedience distinctly both to god and vs and indeed it were ridiculous to imagine obedience without loue though the philipp apostle mentions the one without the other and this is the first point of our disagreement in the matter of iustification which must be marked because if there were no more points of difference betweene vs this one alone were sufficient to keepe vs from vniting of our religions for hereby the church of rome doth race the very foundation and vvhereas m perkins doth say that therein vve raze the foundation that is as he interpreteth it in his preface vve make christ a pseudochrist vve auerre that herein vve doe much more magnifie christ then they do for they take christs merits to be so meane that they do but euen serue the turne to deface sinne and make man vvorthie of the ioyes of heauen nay it doth not serue the turne but onely that god doth not impute sinne vnto vs we contrarivvise doe so highly esteeme of our sauiours inest mable merits that vve hold them vvell able to purchase at god hands a farre inferiour iustice and such merits as mortall man are capable of and to them doe giue such force and value that they make a man iust before god and vvorthy of the kingdome of heauen as shall be proued this slander was answered before we acknowledge the power of christs death as to iustification for the forgiuenes of sinnes so to sanctification for inherent righteousnes and that such righteousnes as is sufficient to make vs pure and holie in the sight of god though we attaine not to the perfection of it as long as we liue in this mortall bodie againe they do great iniurie to god goodnes wisdome and iustice in their iustification for they teach that inward iustice or sanctification is not necessary to iustification yes their ring leader luther saith that the iustified can by no sinnes whatsoeuer except he refuse to beleeue lose their saluation wherein first they make their righteous man like as our sauiour speaketh to sepulchers vvhited on the out side with an imputed iustice but within full of iniquitie and disorder then the wisdome of god must either not discouer this masse of iniquitie or his goodnes abide it or his iustice either wipe it away or punish it but say they he seeth it well enough but couereth it vvith the mantle of christs righteousnes why can any thing be hid from his sight it is madnes to thinke it we doe god no wrong in maintaining his truth that sanctification followes iustification in nature though in time they come together luther saith as the truth is that he which beleeues shal be saued and that faith is not destroyed by any sinne but infidelitie a man iustified as i haue said often is righteous by inherent righteousnes and therefore not like a whited sepulchre our corruptions and sins god seeth and mislikes but hauing punisht them in christ he laies them not to our charge and why doth he not for christs sake deface it and wipe it cleane away and adorne with his grace that soule whom he for his sonnes sake loueth and make it worthy of his loue and kingdome what is it because christ hath not deserued it so to say were to derogate from the infnite value of his merits or is it for that god cannot make such iustice in a pure man as may be worthy of his loue and his kingdome and this were to deny god power in a matter that can be done as we confesse that such vertue was in our first father adam in state of innocence and m perkins seemes to graunt that man in this life at his last gaspe may haue such righteousnes if then we had no other reason for vs but that our iustification doth more exalt the power and goodnesse of god more magnifie the value of christs merits and brigeth greater dignity vnto man our doctrine were much better to be liked then our aduersaries who cannot alleadge one expresse sentence either out of holy scriptures or auncient fathers teaching the imputation of christs righteousnes vnto vs to be our iustification as shall be seene in the reasons following and doe much abase both christs merits and god power wisdome and goodnes it is enough for vs to know what god doth without inquiring curiously into the reason of it yet in this case wee may answere that god doth not make vs perfectly righteous at once that wee may continually depend vpon him and not thinke too highly of our selues as you by reason of that conceit doe ascribing the best part of your second iustification to your owne merits proceeding from your will which grace as you say hath wholy freed but of this also i spake before and must say more hereafter now let vs see by what reasons wee iustifie our doctrine and secondly answere the contrarie obiections reason i that very thing which must be our righteousnesse before god must satisfie the iustice of the law which saith doe these things and thou shalt line now there is nothing can satisfie the iustice of the law but the righteousnes or obedience of christ for vs if any alleage ciuil iustice it is nothing for christ saith except your righteousnesse exceede the righteousnes of the scribes and pharises you cannot enter into the kingdome of heauen this reason is not worth a rush for when he requireth that our iustice must satisfie the iustice of the law i demaund what law he meaneth if moses law of which those words doe this and thou shalt liue are spoken then i answere with the apostle that you are euacuated or abolished from christ that are iustified in the lavv that is he is a iew and no chri stian that wuld haue christian iustice answerable to moses law if m perkins would onely that man iustified must be able to fulfill christs law i then graunt that they so be by the helpe of god grace which will neuer faile them before they faile of their duties he is neither christian nor iew but worse than either that abolisheth the moral law by the gospel the gal apostle speakes of ioyning the law with christ to iustification not of making christian iustice answerable to moses law but is there any likelihood that hee which came to bring perfect righteousnes would destroy the law of righteousnes are you they that finde fault with vs because wee say it is impossible for vs to keepe the commandements so fully as god requireth doth moses law containe any other or greater righteousnes than the perfect loue of god and of our neighbour is it not your common doctrine that faith makes vs able to keepe the law nay doe you not teach that our sauiour hath propounded greater perfection to his followers than was required by the law of moses beside is not the law the very law of nature and can any man bee righteous that keepes not the law of nature you must prooue that god by christ hath either abrogated the morall law or dispensed with christians for the breaches of it not by pardoning of them as the apostle teacheth but by freeing them from obedience to it if this be false then whosoeuer will be iustified by any law must fulfill moses law to which onely the promise is made doe this and thou shalt liue what shall we say that workes doe make vs iust that cannot be for all mens workes are defectiue in respect of the iustice of the law shall we say our sanctification whereby we are renewed to the image of god in righteousnes and true holinesse that also is imperfect and cannot satisfie god iustice required in the law as isai hath said of himselfe and the people all our righteousnesse is as a menstruous cloath but saith m perkins that iustice of man is vnperfect and cannot satisfie the iustice vvhich god requires in his lavv and proues it out of esay who saith all our righteousnesse is as a menstruous or defiled cloath i answere that the holy prophet speaketh those words in the person of the wicked and therefore are madly applied vnto the righteous that he speaketh of the wicked of that nation and of that time appeareth plainly by the text it selfe for he saith before but loe thou hast been angry for vve haue offended and haue been euer in sinne and after there is no man that calleth vpon thy name and standeth vp to take hold by thee and although the words be generall and seeme to the vnskilfull to comprehend himselfe also yet that is but the manner of preachers and specially of such as become intercessors for others who vse to speake in the persons of them for whom they sue for if he had reckoned himselfe in that number he had lyed when he said there is none that call vpon thy name when as he immediatly calleth vpon him in most vehement sort for mercy all which the best learned among them marking confesse that this sentence cannot be alleadged against the vertue of good works hence gather how dexterously m perkins handleth holy scripture that which the prophet spake of some evil man of one place and at one time that he applieth vnto all good man for all times and all places it is no proofe that the prophet speakes not of himselfe as well as of the people because preachers sometimes doe not in the like speeches for sometimes also they doe neither had the prophet lied as you grosly speake if hee had meant himselfe for it is not his purpose to denie that god had been called vpon but so called vpon as hee ought to haue been the prophet speakes of their actions which had some shew of goodnes els he would not say our righteousnes besides he speakes not of that which he presently was to doe as a prophet but of that which ordinarily he and other did with the infirmitie of man luther amp caluin in illum locum esaiae luther and caluin are of opinion that the place doth not properly belong to the proofe of this doctrine but they denie not that the prophet speakes of the faithfull and their works yes caluin plainly affirmes that he doth speake of them the faithfull saith he goe forward in their complaint and the faithfull must confesse their guiltines so doth caietan ad corinthian caietan vnderstand the place alluding to it christ merit is called our righteousnes because it is true righteousnes before god iudgement seate to make a difference between it and our righteousnes which at god iudgement seate is as the cloutes of a menstruous woman de verb esaiae ser our humble righteousnes if it be any is true perhaps saith bernard but not pure vnlesse perchance we thinke our selues better than our fathers who no lesse truly than humbly said all our righteousnes is as the cloutes ampc therefore bernard and caietan expound this place of the righteousnes of iustified man as master perkins doth to haue a cleare conscience before god is a principall part of inward righteousnesse and of it paul in his owne person saith thus i am priuie to nothing by my selfe yet am i not iustified thereby corinthian therefore nothing can procure vnto vs an absolution and acceptance to life euerlasting but christs imputed righteousnesse but he will amend it in the next where he proues out of s paul that a cleare conscience which is a great part of inherent iustice can nothing helpe to our iustification i am priuie to nothing by my selfe and yet j am not iustified thereby here is a very prety peece of cousinage what doth the apostle say that he was not iustified by his cleere conscience nothing lesse but that alb it he saw nothing in himselfe to hinder his iustification yet god who hath sharper eye sight might espie some iniquitie in him and therefore durst not the apostle affirme himselfe to be iustified as if he should say if there be no o her fault in me in god then i can find by mine owne insight i am iustified because i am of nothing and so the place proueth rather the vncertaine knowledge of our iustification as i haue before shewed if the apostle were not iustified by the law who can be that he was not himselfe saith master perkins confesseth euen then when he was not p uie to himselfe of any grosse breach thereof this is master perkins reason to which you answere nothing but frame another argument to your selfe out of the apostles speech and this will appeare if wee doe consider how wee must come one day before god iudgement seat there to be iudged in the rigour of iustice for then we must bring some thing that may counteruaile the iustice of god not hauing onely acceptation in mercie but also approbation in iustice god being not onely mercifull but also a iust iudge but m perkins addeth that we must remember that we shall come to iudgement where rigour of iustice shall be shewed we know it well but when there is no condemnation to those that by baptisme be purged from originall sin as he confesseth himselfe the apostle to teach in our consents about originall sinne what then needeth any iustified man greatly feare the rigorous sentence of a iust iudge and saint paul saith himselfe in the person of the iust that he had ranne a good race ampc and therefore there vvas a crowne of iustice laid vp for him by that iust iudge and not only to him but all them that loue crists comming indeede he that is iustified needes not feare condemnation but the question is whether he can be iustified in god iust iudgement who brings imperfect righteousnes to iustifie himselfe withall which s paul doth not but being iustified by faith in christ lookes for a reward of his holie labours according to the promise of god and concerning both inherent iustice and the ability of it to fulfill the law and what iaw heare this one sentence of s augustine he that beleeueth in him he hath not that iustice which is of the lavv albeit the lavv be good but he shall fulfill the lavv not by iustice vvhich he hath of himselfe but vvhich is giuen of god for charity is the fulfilling of the lavv and from him is this charity povvred into our barts not certainlie by our selues but by the holy ghost vvhich is giuen vs there needes aug de verbis apost ser no mans authoritie to prooue that hee which is iustified hath inherent righteousnes for the apostle saith corinthian amp christ is made sanctification to vs and that by him we are sanctified neither doe we denie that this inherent righteousnes is such as might enable vs to keepe the law and shall when it is perfect but to keepe the law is not onely to haue charitie or righteousnes but to vse it as the law commands righteousnes saith aug ser de temp er austin is nothing els but not to sinne not to sinne is to keepe the commandements of the law that is as himselfe presently expounds it to do none of those things that are forbidden and to doe all those things that are commanded but the chiefe point is what law he meanes out of doubt the law of moses which is alwaies meant when it is put alone without any addition or explication as it is here what law vnderstands he when he saith that iustice which is of the law of the same he saith he shall fulfill legem ipsam the law it selfe besides what rom law doth charitie fulfill questionlesse the law of moses the summe whereof is the loue of god and man reason ii corinthian he which knew no sinne was made sinne for vs that we might be made the righteousnes of god which is in him whence i reason thus as christ was made sin for vs so are we made the righteousnesse of god in him but christ was made sin or a sinner by imputation of our sinnes he being in himselfe most holy therefore a sinner is made righteous before god in that christs righteousnesse is imputed and applied vnto him now if any shall say that ma is iustified by righteousnes infused then by like reason i say christ was made sinne for vs by infusion of sinne which to say is blasphemie i denie both propositions the former because it hath a comparison in the manner of our iustification with the sinne which christ was made for vs for in the text of the apostle there is no signification of a similitude that christ was so made sinne as we are made iust that is then m perkins vaine glosse without any liklyhood in the text the other proposition is also false for christ was not made sinne by imputation for sin in that place is taken figuratiuely and signifieth according to the exposition of auncient fathers an host or sacrifice for sinne which christ was truely made his body being sacrificed on the crosse for the discharge of sinne and not by imputation that there is some comparison of likenes implied by the apostle it appeares by aug enchir ad laurent cap austin he therefore was made sinne that we might be made righteousnes not ours but god not in vs but in him as he demonstrauit made shew of sinne not of his owne but of ours not constitutum resting in him but in vs that interpretation indeed is generally best liked of because of the hebraisme but yet the place may also be expounded otherwise as lombard thomas caietan catharin gloss interlin your owne writers shew he made him to be counted a sinner saith thomas and catharin more fully in illo posuit peccata nostrum omnium he laid vpon him the sinnes of vs all and especially that originall sinne out of which as out of a roote the other spring and the exposition of this place by s hierome is not to be despised christ saith he beeing offered for our sinnes tooke the name of sinne that we might bee made the righteousnesse of god in him not ours nor in vs if this righteousnesse of god be neither ours nor in vs then it can bee no inherent righteousnesse but must needes be righteousnes imputed and chrysost on this place saith it is called god righteousnes because it is not of workes and because it must be without all staine or want and that cannot bee inherent righteousnes anselme saith he is made sinne as wee are made iustice not ours but god not in vs but in him as he is made sinne not his owne but ours not in himselfe but in vs how these words of the apostle iustice of god are to be vnderstood see saint augustine one place i will cite for all the iustice of god saith he through the saith of christ jesus that is by faith wherewith we beleeue in christ for as that faith is called christs not by vvhich christ beleeues so that iustice is called god not whereby god is iust both of them faith and iustice be ours but therefore they are tearmed god and christs because through their liberality they are giuen to vs which interpretation may be confirmed out of that place of s chrysostom which m perkins citeth saying it is called god iustice because it is not of works but of his free gift so that it is not that which is in god himselfe but such as he bestoweth vpon vs and that iustice of it selfe is pure and wanteth no vertue to work that for which it is giuen to wit to make a man righteous s anselme a right vertuous and learned catholike arch bishop of ours shall be answered when the place is quoted the iustice of god is expounded by the apostle to be the forgiuenes of sinnes especially vpon your interpretation for what is it that christ rom procures by his sacrifice but pardon the wrath of god being appeased it is indeed called the righteousnes of god because it is giuen vs by god and chiefly because it is appointed and approoued of god they that make it inherent in vs as it cannot be prooued by this place that s austin doth stretch it further than the apostle vseth to doe and make it comprehend sanctification also it is but a shift to put off anselm ad corinthian a s lme whom you cannot answere it had been casie for you to conceiue that he meanes his commentarie vpon that place but how chance hierome is past ouer too we must haue some other excuse for the place is quoted reason iii rom as by one mans disobedience many were made sinners so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous marke here is a comparison betweene the first and second adam and hence i reason thus as by the disobedience of the first adam man were made sinners so by the obedience of the second adam are we made righteous now we are not onely made sinners by propagation of naturall corruption but by imputation for adams first sinne was the eating of the forbidden fruite which verie acte is no personall offence but is imputed to all his posteritie in whom we haue all sinned the i n l br cap ch ad neop fathers call this very sinne adams hand writing making vs debters vnto god and therefore in like manner the obedience of christ is made the righteousnesse of euery beleeuer not by infusion but by imputation the comparison i allovv because it is the apostles and deny that man are made sinners by imputation of adams fault and say that euery one descended of adam by natural propagation hath his ovvn pe onal iniquity stieking in them which is commonly called o ginal sin and an high point of pelagiamsme is it to deny it for albeit vve did not of the forbidden fruit in proper person yet receiue vve the nature of man polluted vvith that infection really and not by imputation and so the comparison serues not at all m perkins turne but beareth very strongly against him it being thus framed as by adams disobedience many vvere made sinners euen so by christs obedience many shall be iustified this is his major novv to the minor but by adams disobedience they were made sinners by drawing from him euery one his owne proper inherent iniquitie in like manner vve are iustified by christ not by imputation of his iustice but by our inherent iustice vvhich is povvred into our soules vvhen are in baptisme borne a new in him see what penury of poore arguments they haue that to make some shew of store are forced to propound such as make manifestly against them your bare deniall is no sufficient answere especially since greater clerkes directly affirme the contrarie viz that that sin of adams makes vs debters to god whereof we are all guiltie as hauing committed it in his loynes all man saith aug contra iulian pelag lib cap austin are vnderstood to haue sinned in the first man because all man were in him when he sinned yes more then that he saith all man committed that sin in him because all were that one man as leui saith dominic soto ad rom cap domingo a soto many yeeres before he was borne paid tithes in abraham in like sort we sinned in the loynes of adam we denie not that we receiue from adam inherent vnrighteousnes by propagation but affirme that adams sinne is imputed to vs to our iust condemnation reason iv a satisfaction made for the want of that iustice or obedience which the lawe requires at our hands is accepted of god as the iustice it selfe but christ obedience is a satisfaction made for the want of that iustice or obedience which the lawe requires as the papists themselues auouch therefore this satisfaction is our iustice and me thinks the papists vpon this consideration haue little cause to dissent from vs for if they make christs obedience their satisfaction why should they not fullie close hands with vs and make it their iustice also for the major he citeth bellarmine i haue read the chapter and find no such words further i say there is a great difference betweene satisfaction for mortall sinnes and iustification for satisfaction cannot be done by vs for the guilt of mortall sinne is infinite being against an infinite maiesty and so no creature can make full satisfaction for it wherfore the infinit valour of christs satisfaction is necessarily required who hauing taken away the guilt of eternall punishment due to sinners leaueth vs his grace to satisfie for the temporall paine of it as shal be in his due place declared more at large againe a man must needs haue his sinnes pardoned and grace giuen him before he can make any kind of due satisfaction for he must be in the state of grace before he can satisfie wherefore he must needs flie to the benefit of christs satisfaction there is nothing like in iustification for first to make a man iust in god sight requires no infinite perfection but such as a meere man is very well capable of as all must needes confesse of adam in the state of innocence and of all the blessed soules in heauen who be iust in god sight neither is it necessary to be infinit for to be worthy of the ioyes of heauen which be not infinit as they are enioyed of man or angels either who haue all things there in number weight and measure master perkins argument is wholy omitted by you and a consectarie which he drawes from it propounded in stead of it the argument is this a satisfaction made for the want of that iustice or obedience which the law requires at our hands is accepted of god as iustice it selfe but christs obedience is a satisfaction made for the want of that iustice or obedience which the law requires therefore christs obedience is accepted of god as the iustice it selfe vpon this he concludes yet further if the papists make christs obedience their satisfaction why should they not make it their iustice the reason of the proposition is because god accepts such satisfaction for iustice but they make christs obedience their satisfaction therefore why should they not make it their iustice your answere must be applied to the consequence of the proposition the proofe whereof as i haue shewed is fetcht from the former syllogisme to which you answer nothing at all but let vs take it as it is and it is thus much in effect that you haue neede of christs satisfaction but no neede of his iustice so then belike you will not accept of his righteousnes as yours because you are loth to be any more beholding to him than needs you must that you need it not you prooue because a meere man is capable of sufficient lighteousnes to iustification but that will not serue the turne vnlesse also he haue as much as he is capable of to which estate no man attaines in this life by your confession who admit an increase of iustice euery day briefly it is a most easie thing for one man to pay the debts of an other but one man cannot bestow his wisedome or iustice on an other and not credible that god whose iudgement is according to truth will repute a man for iust who is full of iniquity no more then a simple man will take a black moore for white although he see him cloathed in a white sute of apparell secondly you take it not as yours because christ cannot bestow it on you what not so much as to haue it imputed to you why not as well as adams sinne is mads ours by imputation but god you say whose iudgement is according to truth will not repute a man iust who is full of iniquitie indeede god cannot be deceiued to hold a man not to be wicked that is wicked but god can iustifie that is forgiue and acquite him though he know him to be wicked and can take him for righteous in christ of whom he is a member though in himselfe he be not righteous so may the man that will not take a blacke moore for white accept of him as if he were white without any error reason v the consent of the auncient church bernard saith epistle the iustice of an other is assigned vnto man who wanted his owne man was indepted and man made paiment the satisfaction of one is imputed to all and why may not iustice be from an other as well as guiltinesse is from another and in cant sermon it sufficeth me for all righteousnesse to haue him alone mercifull to me against whom i haue sinned and not to sinne is god iustice mans iustice is the mercifullnesse of god and sermon shall i sing mine owne righteousnesse lord i will remember thy righteousnesse alone for it is mine also in that euen thou article made vnto me righteousnesse of god what shall i feare least that one bee not sufficient for vs both it is a short cloke that cannot couer two it will couer both thee and me largely beeing both a large and eternall iustice master perkins last reason is taken from the consent of the auncient church and yet citeth sauing one two lines nothing out of any auncient writer not out of any other but out of only s bernard who liued yeares after christ so that he signifieth that there is little releefe to be had in antiquity what reliefe there is for vs touching this point in the fathers shall appeare more fully hereafter if it please god in another treatise in the meane while take a taste by these who acknowledge their righteousnes imperfect and vnable to abide god iudgement this saith in concio de humilitate basil is perfect and sound reioycing in god when a man doth not bragge no not of his righteousnes but knowes himselfe vnworthie of true righteousnes and that he is iustified onely by faith in christ and in basil in psalm another place euerlasting rest remaines for them which in this life haue striuen lawfully not for the desert of their workes but by the fauour of the most bountifull god in whom they haue hoped charitie saith aug epistle ad hietonym austin in some is greater in some lesse in other none at all but so great charitie as cannot be increased is in no man so long as he liues here now so long as it may be increased surely that which is lesse than it should be is faultie by reason of which fault there is not a righteous man vpon earth that doth good and sinnes not by reason of which fault no man liuing shall be iustified in the sight of god because of this fault if we say we haue no sinne the truth is not in vs and for this also how much soeuer we haue done it is necessarie for vs to say forgiue vs our debts though all our words deedes and thoughts were forgiuen in baptisme i will not boast saith de iacob amp vita beata ca ambrose because i am righteous but because i am redeemed i will boast not because i am voide of sinnes but because my sinnes are forgiuen me which caluin declareth more plainely for he commonly setting light by all other in this question reiecteth also s augustine saying yes not the sentence of augustine himselfe is to be receiued in this matter vvho attributeth our samctification to grace wherewith we are regenerate in newnes of life by the spirit and kemnitius in the first part of his examination of the councell of rent saith vve contend not how the fathers take iustification and a little after i am not ignorant that they spake othervvise then we doe of it therefore m perkins had reason to content himselfe with some few broken sentences of later vvriters caluin doth not commonly reiect the fathers in this point but both he and chemnitius alleage diverse things out of them in this question of iustification for chemnit de iustif tit i estimonia chemnitius looke in the place you haue named in his disputation of iustification calu instit lib c caluins words will cleere him sufficiently if they be truly reported yes not the sentence of austin himselfe or at the least not his manner of speech is per omnia in all sorts to be receiued for although he notably spoyle man of all commendation of righteousnes and passe ouer all to god grace yet he referres grace to sanctification whereby we are regenerate into newnes of life through the spirit indeed it is vsuall with austin and the latin fathers to speake of iustificare facere iustification as the word seemed to leade them and so to comprise vnder it sanctification also in which respect caluin and chemnitius say they are the lesse to be receiued but as for iustification they spake ordinarily as you heard before when they speak properly acknowledging euen the charitie of man regenerate as i shewed out of aug epistle d hieron austin by which the law is fulfilled to be imperfect and vnable to iustifie vs in the sight of god but was s bernard trow you in this one point a protestant nothing lesse his words be these the iustice of another is assigned vnto man vvho wanted his own man vvas indebted and man made payment ampc but let his owne reason there cited serue for exposition of his former words which is this for vvhy may not iustice be from another aswell as guiltines is from another now guiltines from adam is not by imputation but euery one contracts his owne by taking flesh from him euen so iustice from christ powred into euery man that is borne againe of water and the holy ghost in the second place he saith that mans iustice is the mercifulnes of god that is by god free grace and mercy it is bestovved vpon vs your answere to the bern pi first place of bernard was refuted before when i prooued that adams sinne was made ours by imputation how will that agree with the former part of the sentence bernard in cant ser the iustice of god is not to sinne but the iustice of man is bestowed by god free mercie there is a poore difference between these two when as god may bestow such righteousnes vpon a man that he shall be free from sinning but thus stands the opposition not to sinne is god righteousnes not to haue sinne imputed through god mercie is mans righteousnes with s bernard in the third place we acknowledge that we haue no iustice of our owne that is from our selues but from the goodnesse of god through the merits of our blessed sauiours passion read his first sermon vpon these words of the prophet jsaie vid dominum ampc there you shall see him speake plainely of inherent iustice and how it is a distinct thing from the iustice of christ how vaine and sleight an answere this is the very words will shew bernard in cantic ser thou article made vnto me righteousnes of god he speakes of such a righteousnes as is both his and christs shall i feare saith he least that one be not sufficient for vs both it is not a short cloake that cannot couer it will couer both thee and me largely being both a large and eternall iustice in bernard ser super esai the place by you quoted he speakes not a word of any righteousnes but in ser super esai the fifth sermon vpon that text he compares the righteousnes of man and angels with god not inherent with imputed but what if he speake of inherent righteousnes as he doth in many places doe we deny it or is there because of that none imputed or is that inherent righteousnes sufficient to iustifie vs in god sight let bernard ser de verb esaiae bernard speake for himselfe our humble righteousnes if there be any is recte forsit true perhaps but not pure vnlesse perchance saith bernard vpon that very place of esay we thinke our selues better than our fathers who said no lesse truly than humbly all our righteousnes is as the cloutes of a menstruous woman for how can there be pure righteousnes whereas yet there cannot be fault wanting it is no marueile then if you now make light of bernard whom otherwise you magnifie his testimonie must needes bee accounted of that is so plaine for vs and against you whereas he was a member of your owne church and erred with you in many points of antichristianisme august on psalm he prayeth for our faults and hath made our fault his faults that he might make his iustice our iustice another broken peece of a sentence there is cited out of s augustine christ made his iustice our iustice that is by his iustice he hath merited iustice for vs as he expoundeth himselfe what is this the iustice of god and the iustice of man the iustice of god is here called that not whereby god is iust but that which god giueth to man that man may be iust through god what a forced interpretation is this christ saith august in psalm austin made his iustice our iustice that is say you by his iustice he hath merited iustice for vs he hath made his ours that is he hath by his purchased other for vs who can beare such an exposition sure the words will not nor the sense for how shall we expound the former part of the sentence which you craftily leaue out he hath made our sinnes his sinnes haue our sinnes merited sinne for him if this be absurd as it is how shall your interpretation be auowed the latter part depending vpon the former as for the exposition you bring out of aug tract in ioh another place where the iustice of god is said to be that which god giueth man this proues that which before i deliuered that the fathers sometimes make iustification to comprehend sanctification too but where they speake properly of iustification there they teach as we doe obiections of the papists proouing inherent righteousnesse to bee the matter of our iustice before god are these obiect i it is absurd that one man should bee made righteous by the righteousnesse of an other for it is as much as if one man were made wise by the wisedome of another answer it is true that no man can bee made righteous by the personall righteousnesse of another because it pertaines onely to one man and because the wisedome that is in one man is his altogether wholly it cannot be the wisdom of another no more then the health and life of one bodie can bee the health of but it is otherwise with the righteousnesse of it is his indeede because it is inherent in him as in a subiect it is not his alone but his and ours together by the tenour of the couenant of grace christ as he is a mediatour is giuen to euery beleeuer as really and truely as land is giuen from man to man and with him are giuen all things that concerne saluation they being made ours by god free gift among which is christ his righteousnesse by it therefore as being a thing of our owne wee may bee iustified before god and accepted to life euerlasting this answere solueth not the difficulty any whit at all for christs wisedome power and other giftes are not imputed vnto vs as it is euident why then is his iustice more then the rest we confesse that in a good sense all christs gifts are ours that is they were all employed to purchase our redemption and we doe dayly offer them to god that he will for his sonnes sake more and more wash vs from our sinnes and bestow his graces more plentifull vpon vs thus are all christs riches ours so long as we keepe our selues members of his mysticall body but this is nothing to the point which the argument tou d how one man may formally be made iust by the iustice of another rather then wise by the wisdome of another the reason why our sauiour christs other gifts are not imputed to vs is because we stand not in neede of them for the fulfilling of the law to iustification they also belong to vs as members of his mysticall bodie wee doe not offer them to god but intreate him for his sonnes sake who was so and so qualified and did such and such things and aboue all who is so beloued to be mercifull vnto vs and to accept vs for his children as for any formall wisedome or iustice which should make any reall change in vs we looke not for it in iustification but in sanctification and that is not christs but ours personally obiect ii if a sinner bee iustified by christ his righteousnesse then euery beleeuer shall be as righteous as christ and that can not be ans the proposition is false for christ his righteousnesse is not applyed to vs according as it is in christ neither according to the same measure nor the same manner for his obedience in fulfilling the lawe is aboue adams righteousnesse yes aboue the righteousnesse of all angels for they were all but creatures and their obedience the obedience of creatures but christ his obedience is the obedience or righteousnesse of god so tearmed rom corinthian not onely because god accepted of it but because it was in that person which is very god when christ obeyed god obeyed and when he suffered god suffered not because the god head suffered or performed anie obedience but because the person which according to one nature is god performed obedience and suffered and by this means his righteousnesse is of infinite value price merit amp efficacy hence also it commeth to passe that this obedience of christ serueth not only for the iustifying of some one person namely for himselfe as adams did but of all and euery one of the elect yes it is sufficient to iustifie many thousand worlds now to come to the point this righteousnesse ousnesse that is in christ in this largenes and measure is pertaining to vs in a more narrow skantling because it is onely receiued by faith as any one s ar pa takes in the whole light of the vvith of the r sorth as said light it to sinne so farforth as it serueth to iustifie any particular beleeuer but they vrge the reason further saying if christ his righteousnes be the righteousnesse of euery beleeuer then euery man should be a sauiour which is absurd answer i answer as before and yet more plainely thus christ his righteousnesse is imputed to the person of this or that man not as it is the price of redemption for all mankind but as it is the price of redemption for one particular man as for example christ his righteousnes is imputed to peter not as it is the price of redemption for all but as it is the price of redemption for peter and therefore christ his righteousnesse is not applyed to any one sinner in that largenesse and measure in which it is in the person of christ but onely so sarreforth as it serueth to satisfie the lawe for the saide sinner and to make his person accepted of god as righteous and no further that which is applied of christs iustice to this or that man is either infinite and then the man is as iust as christ for there can be no greater then infinite in the same kinde or it is not infinite but in a certaine measure as he seemeth to graunt and then it is no part of christs in n t iustice for all the parts of an infinit thing are infinit according vnto true philosophy it remaineth then that a certaine limited portion of in stice is deriued out of christs infinit iustice and powred into this o that man as in his owne example the light of euery starre is receiued from the sun beames yet is not the light in the starre the same which is in the sun for one accident cannot be in two subiects so far distant neither is it of like vertue to lighten the skyes as it is euident but is a far d mmer light somewhat like vnto that of the sun from whence it came euen so in our iustification from the son of iustice christ iesus certaine beames of particular iustice are conueied into this or that mans soule whereby it is both lightned by faith and inflamed by charity but there is exceeding difference betweene their two iustices more then there is betweene the light of the sun and the light of a starre which s augustine in expresse tearmes deliuereth saying how much difference there is betvveene the light that doth lighten and that vvhich is sightened that is the sun and the starre light so much difference is there betvveene the iustice that doth iustifie and that iustice vvhich is made by that iustification to wit betvveene the iustice of christ and that vvhich is in eue good christian the iustice of christs humane nature for of that now we speake is not properly infinite but onely in regard of his person therfore though it were all communicated to some man yet should it not in him be infinite you wholy mistake the matter for master perkins doth not meane that there is any part of christs righteousnes inherently made ours as the light of the starre receiued from the sun remaines in it but brings that similitude only to shew that the whole is applied to euery one that is iustified in his seuerall proportion as for inherent righteousnes that is rather an effect than an application of christs righteousnes it may be also master perkins was of opinion that the starres as the moone haue no light in themselues but only reflect the light of the sun shining on them and then it is true that the light which comes from them is the very light of the sun varied according to the nature and position of each seuerall starre austin speakes of iustification and iustice as they are largely taken for sanctification also neither doth hee compare christs righteousnes as hee is man with ours but shewes how infinitly god wisedome and iustice exceede mans as hee doth aug epistle ad consenti elsewhere by the same similitude obiect iii if we be made righteous by christ his righteousnesse truly then christ is a sinner truly by our sinnes but christ is not indeede a sinner by our sinnes answer we may with reuerence to his maiestie in good manner say that christ was a sinner and that truely not by any infusion of sinne into his most holy person but because our sinnes were laid vpon him the third reason for the catholike party if man be made truely and really iust by christs iustice imputed vnto them in like manner christ should be made really vniust by the iniquitie and sinnes of man impu ed vnto him for there is no reason to the contrary but one may aswell be mande vniust by imputation as iust especially considering that euill is made more easilie and more vvaies then good m per ansvvere is that vve may say christ vvas a sinner truely not because he had sinne in him but because our sinnes vvere laide on his shoulders that reason is naught for he is not truly a sinner that paies the debt of sinne vvhich an innocent and most iust person may performe but he that either hath sinne truly in him or is so by imputation stroken that the sins are made his ovvne really and he in all cases to be dealt vvithall as if he sinned himselfe as they hold that one iustified by imputation of christs iustice is really in god sight iust and is both loued in this life and shall be revvarded in the next as if he vvere truly iust indeed but to auouch our sauiour christ to be so a sinner is to say that he was auerted from god the slaue of the diuel amp son of perdition which is plaine b a hemie he is truly a debtor that bindes himselfe to pay the debt by that meanes taking it vpon him as if hee were hee that principally owes the money article part article it is no blasphemie at all to auow that our sauiour christ hauing taken our sinnes vpon him was in that respect to god for vs as euery one of vs is in himselfe to god doth not the gal apostle say that christ hath redeemed vs from the curse of the law becomming a curse for vs thus saith the holie ghost hee which knew no sinne was made sinne for vs and he was counted with sinners isa yet so as euen then in himselfe he was without blot yes more holy then all man and angels on this manner said chrysostom corinthian god permitted christ to be condemned as a sinner again he made the iust one to be a sinner that he might make sinners iust that sentence out of the prophet he vvas counted vith sinners is expounded by the uang lists that he was so taken indeede but by a wicked iudge and a reprohate people and theefore if you allow of their sentence range yourselfe with them asoneof their number s by him produced confirmeth the same saying that god permitted him to be condemned as a sinner not that he was one truly ch i know is called sinne by s but by a figure ng that he as a sacrifice for sinne as hath been before declared the same blessed apostle when he speaketh properly affirmeth in plaine tearmes that christ was tempted like vnto vs in all things excepting sinne the wicked iewes accounted him to be sinfull in himselfe that blasphemie wee disclaime and hold him to haue been alwaies most pure and holy saue onely for our sinnes charged vpon him as the leuit sinnes of the people were in a type laid on the scape goate obiect iv if a man be made righteous by imputation then god iudgeth sinners to bee righteous but god iudgeth no sinner to bee righteous for it is abhomination to the lord answer when god iustifieth a sinner by christ his righteousnes at the same time he ceaseth in regard of guiltinesse to bee a sinner and to whom god imputeth righteousnesse them hee sanctifieth at the very same instant by his holy spirit giuing also vnto originall corruption his deadly wound if a man be righteous onely by imputation he may together be full of iniquitie vvhereupon it must needs follovv that god doth take for iust and good him that is both vniust and vvicked but that is absurd vvhen god iudgement is according to truth here m perkins yeeldeth that vvhen god doth impute christs iustice vnto any man he doth together sanctifie the partie giuing originall sinne a deadly vvound and yet else where he said that originall sinne vvhich remained after iustification in the party did beare such svvay that it infected all the vvorkes of the said party and made him miserable ampc but it is good hearing of amendment if he wil abide in it it is a good shift to multiplie words when you know not what to say master perkins obiection and answere are almost in as few words as you make the obiection is this to pare off superfluitie here is nothing altered that before was deliuered originall sinne remaines the same it was and so defiles our actions still but it hath not the same strength obiect v that which adam neuer lost was neuer giuen by christ but he neuer lost imputed righteousnesse therefore it was neuer giuen vnto him ans the proposition is not true for sauing faith that was neuer lost by adam is giuen to vs in christ and adam neuer had this priuiledge that after the first grace should follow the vve haue amp posse amp velle he had no more but posse vellet and e vvanted velle quod posset august de corrept amp grat cap second and thereupon beeing left to himselfe hee fell from god and yet this mercie is vouchsafed to all beleeuers that after their first conuersion god wil stil confirme them with new grace and by this meanes they perseuere vnto the ende and whereas they say that adam had not imputed righteousnesse i answere that hee had the same for substance though not for the manner of applying by imputation the fift reason is inuerted by m perkins but may be rightly framed thus christ restored vs that iustice vvhich vve lost by adams fall but by him vve lost inherent iustice ergo by christ vve are restored to inherent iustice the major is gathered out of s paul who affirmeth that we receiue more by christ then we lost by adam and is saint jreneus and saint augustines most expresse doctrine who say hovv are vve saide to be renevved if vve receiue not againe vvhich the first man lost ampc jmmortality of body vve receiue not but vve receiue iustice from the vvhich he sell through sinne master perkins conclusion was to the purpose though one of the propositions as he hath prooued and you grant by not answering was false but the reason as you frame it is nothing at all against vs for we denie not that we receiue inherent iustice by christ but that to bee iustified is to bee righteous in god fight by inherent righteousnes obiect vi iustification is eternall but the imputation of christ his righteousnesse is not eternall for it ceaseth in the ende of this life therefore it is not that which iustifieth a sinner answer the imputation of christs righteousnesse is euerlasting for he that is esteemed righteous in this life by christ his righteousnes is accepted as righteous for euer and the remission of sinnes granted in this life is for euer continued and though sanctification be perfect in the world to come yet shall it not iustifie for wee must conceiue it no otherwise after this life but as a fruit springing from the imputed righteousnes of christ without which it could not be and a good childe will not cast away the first garment because his father giues a second and what if inward righteousnesse be perfect in the ende of this life shal we therefore make it the matter of our iustification god forbid for the righteousnesse whereby sinners are iustified must be had in the time of this life before the panges of death the sixt and last reason for catholikes is the iustice of the faithfull is eternall uieth after this life and is ned in bea en but christs imputed iustice ceaseth in the end of this life eigo m perkins answereth first that imputed righteousnes continueth with vs for euer and that in heauen we all haue no other secondly that perhaps in the end of this life in ward righteousnes shall be perfect and then without perhaps it shal be most perfect in heauen so that one part of this answere ouerthroweth the other wherfore i need not stand vpon it but will pro eed to fortifie our partie with some authorities taken both forth of the holy scriptures and auncient fathers there are many pitifull shifts in this answere first master perkins denies the assumption which you leaue so ouerthrowne and runne to fortifie your owne partie secondly he giueth the reason of his deniall that acceptation of vs as righteous and forgiuenes of sinnes shall be continued in heauen thirdly he saith not that wee shall haue no other righteousnes in heauen but the quite contrarie viz sanctification which is inherent righteousnes here imperfect fourthly he puts it not to perhaps but resolutly affirmes that sanctification shall be perfect in the end of this life fiftly there is not in his speech so much as a shew of any contradiction which ariseth wholy from that clause foysted in by you we shall haue no other lastly as any man may discerne you change master perkins conclusion and so his whole reason the first place i take out of these words of s paul and these things certes vvere you dronkers couetous fornicators ampc but you are vvashed you are sanctified you are iustified in the name of our lord iesus christ and in the spirit of our lord here iustification by the best interpreters iudgement is defined to consist in those actions of washing vs from our sins and of infusion of god holy gifts by the holy ghost in the name and the sake of christ iesus first i answere as before that the fathers often take iustification for sanctification also secondly i say bellarm de iustif lib c bellarmine out of whom you take this hath deceiued you chrysost ad corinthian chrysostom doth not make iustification consist in those actions of washing ampc his words are these god hath washed vs and not that onely but hath sanctified vs neither that onely but hath iustified vs now if washing and sanctifying be iustifying in chrysostoms iudgement how doth he rise from one to another as diverse things theophy ibid theophylact makes them diverse at least in nature god hath clensed you from them saith theophylact yes and sanctified you how by iustifying you faith he for he hath washed you then afterward iustifying he hath sanctified you theodor ibid theodoret expounds the place of forgiuenes of sins in baptisme your glossa ordin ibid ordinarie glosse applies washing to baptisme sanctifying to the holy ghost giuen vs that wee may worke well and iustifying to our working well ambros ibid ambrose saith that in baptisme he that beleeues is washed is iustified in the name of the lord and is adopted a son to god by the spirit of our god but neuer a one of these saith that iustification consists in these actions of washing and infusion of god gifts the like description of our iustification is in s paul of his mercie he hath saued vs by the lauer of regeneration and renewing of the holy ghost vvhom he hath povvred into vs abundantly through iesus christ our sauiour that being iustified by his grace vve may be heires in hope and not in certainety of faith of life euerlasting where the apostle inferring that being iustified by his grace declareth that in the words before he had described the same iustification to consist in our new birth of baptisme and the enewing of oursoules by the infusion of his heauenly giftes vvhich god of his mercy did bestow vpon vs for his son chrsts sake this is but your glosse for the grace of god in that place signifies the fauour of god as rom corinthian heb otherwhere the same phrase doth or the loue of christ who as lyra ad tit lyra there saith makes vs the adopted son of god aietan ibi caietan makes an opposition between god grace and our workes as the rom apostle doth if it be of grace it is no more of workes so doth chrysost amp theoph ad tit chrysostom and theophylact vnderstand it of fauour not of debt for if he saued vs per grariam by fauour when we were desperate and cast away much more saith theophylact shall he giue vs those good things to come now we are iustified as the rom apostle saith if when we were enemy we were reconciled to god by the death of his son much more being reconciled wee shall be saued by his life many other places i omit for breuity sake and will be content to cite few fathers because the best learned of our aduersaries do confesse that they be all against them as i haue shewed before first s augustine saith that this iustice of ours which they call righteousnes is the grace of christ regenerating vs by the holy ghost and is a beautie of our invvard man it is the renuing of the reasonable part of our soule and twenty other such like whereby he manifestly declareth our iustice to be inherent and not the imputed iustice of christ let him suffice for the latin fathers and s cyrill for the greekes who of our iustification writeth thus the spirit is a heate vvho as soone as he hath povvred charity into vs and hath vvith the fire of it inflamed our minds vve haue euen then obtained iustice in the aug de pecca merie amp rem ss cap first place alleaged by you there is no such matter onely austin proues against the pelagians that we are not sinners from adam by imitation alone because then we should also be righteous from christ by nothing but imitation in the aug epistle ad comentiu epistle to consentius he speakes not of that righteousnes whereby wee are iustified but of that which is inherent what other thing saith he is iustice in vs or any other vertue by which we liue orderly and wisely than the beautie of the inward man this is true of those graces we receiue by sanctification august de trinit lib cap he doth not say that the grace by which we are iustified is the renewing of the reasonable part of our soule but that the renewing of god image in vs is the renewing of that part now this is done by sanctification not by iustification properly taken i can finde no such thing in that booke of cyril de trinit lib cyrill but if euer he spake so what is that against vs who easily grant that we are inherently righteous as soone as the sanctifying spirit of god hath kindled the fire of loue in our hearts ii difference about the manner of iustification all both papists and protestant agree that a sinner is iustified by faith this agreement is onely in worde and the difference betweene vs is great in deede and it may be reduced to these three heads first the papist saying that a man is iustified by faith vnderstandeth a general or a catholike faith whereby a man beleeueth the articles of religion to bee true but we hold that the faith which iustifieth is a particular faith whereby we applie to our selues the promises of righteousnesse and life euerlasting by christ and that our opinion is the truth i haue proued before but i will adde a reason or twaine reason i the faith whereby we liue is that faith whereby we are iustified but the faith whereby we liue spiritually is a particular faith wherby we apply christ vnto our selues as paul saith gal i liue that is spiritually by the faith of the son of god which faith he sheweth to be a particular faith in christ in the very wordes following who hath loued me and giuen himselfe for me particularly and in this manner of beleeuing paul was and is an example to all that are to be saued tim and philipp ans the aior i admit and deny the minor and say that the proofe is not to purpose for in the minor he speaketh of faith vvhereby vve apply christs merits vnto ourselues making them ours in the proofe s paul saith only that christ died for him in particular he makes no mention of his apprehending of christs iustice and making of it his owne which are very distinct things all catholikes beleeue with saint paul that christ dyed as for all man in generall so for euery man in particular yes and that his loue vvas so exceeding great tovvards mankind that he vvould vvillingly haue bestovved his life for the redemption of one only man but hereupon it doth not follovv that euery man may lay hands vpon christs righteousnes and apply it to himselfe or else tu s iovves heretikes and euill catholikes might make verie bold with him but must first doe those things vvhich he requires at their hands to be made partakers of his inestimable merits as to repent them hartely of their sins to beleeue and hope in him to be baptized and to haue a full purpose to obserue all his commandements which m also confesseth that allmen haue not only promised but also ov ed in baptisme novv because vve are not assured that vve shall performe all therefore vve may not so presumptuously apply vnto oursel es christs righteousnes and life euerlasting although vve beleeue that he died for euery one of vs in particular that vvhich follovveth in m perkins hath no colour of probability that s paul in this manner of beleefe that is in applying to himselfe christs merits vvas an example to all that are saued see the places good reader and learne to bevvare the bold vnskilfulnes of sectaries for there is not a vvord sounding that vvay but only hovv he hauing receiued mercy vvas made an example of patience master perkins prooues his minor thus the faith by which paul liued was a particular faith whereby he applied christ to himselfe but the faith by which we liue is the faith by which paul liued therefore the faith by which we liue is a particular faith whereby we applie christ to our selues the proposition master perkins prooues by the gal apostles testimonie where he doth particularly apply christ to himselfe as hauing loued him and died for him you answere that s paul makes no mention of his apprehending of christs iustice no more doth master perkins in his proposition but the apostle mentions such a particular faith as master perkins speakes of viz a perswasion that christs benefits belong to him in particular and that christ hath particularly loued him which is to apprehend christ and this is another manner of matter than to hold that christ died for euery particular man which the diuels no doubt doe acknowledge the assumption is euident of it selfe for there is no question but that all which are iustified haue and liue by the same faith but master perkins sets out the matter by two places of scripture in the former whereof tim the apostle propounds himselfe to all man as an example of god mercie that they may assure them selues that if they will beleeue in christ as hee did they should haue forgiuenes of their sinnes as he had in philipp the latter hauing shewed that he cast off all confidence in his owne righteousnes and accounted it as dung resting onely vpon god for his righteousnes by faith in iesus christ he exhorts all man to follow his example both in faith and holinesse reason that which we are to aske of god in prayer wee must beleeue it shall be giuen vs as wee aske it but in prayer wee are to aske the pardon of our owne sinnes and the merit of christs righteousnesse for our selues therefore wee must beleeue the same particularly the proposition is a rule of god word requiring that in euery petition wee bring a particular faith whereby wee beleeue that the thing lawfully asked shall bee giuen accordingly mark of the major much hath been said before here i admit it all due circumstances of prayer being obserued and deny that vve must pray that our sauiour christ iesus merits may be made ours in particular for that vvere greatly to abase them but good christians pray that through the infinite value of those his merits our sinnes may be forgiuen and a iustice proportionable vnto our capacity may be powred into our soul vvhereby vve may leade a vertuous life and make a blessed end it is no abasing of our sauiours merits that is of his obedience to the morall law and his suffrings that they should be communicated to euery member of his mysticall body for their iustification as long as the worke of redemption remaines proper to him the minor is also euident neither can it be denied for we are taught by christ himselfe to pray on this manner forgiue vs our debts and to it we say amen that is that our petitions shall without all doubt bee graunted vnto vs august sermon de temp but it is goodly to behold hovv master perkins proueth that vve must pray that christs righteousnes may be made our particular iustice because saith he vve are taught in the pater noster to pray in this manner forgiue vs our debts and to this vve must say amen vvhich is as much to say as our petition is graunted i thinke the poore mans vvits vvere gone a pilgrimage vvhen he vvrote thus good sir cannot our sins or debts be forgiuen vvithout vve applie christs righteousnes to vs in particular vve say yes doe not then so simpl begge that vvhich is in question nor take that for giuen vvhich vvill neuer be graunted our sins cannot be forgiuen without that part of christs merits be applied to vs by which sinne is satisfied for as all man sinned in adam so all man satisfie for sin in christ namely all man that by faith are one with christ but a vvord vvith you by the vvay your righteous man must ouerskippe that petition of the pater nos er sorgiue vs our debts for he is wel assured that his debts be alreadie pardoned for at the very first instant that he had faith he had christs righteousnes applied to him and therby assurance both of the pardon of sinnes and of life euerlasting wherfore he cannot vvithout infidelity distiust of his former iustification or pray for remission of his debts but follovving the famous example of that formall pharisie in lievv of demaunding pardon may vvell ay o god giue thee thankes that i am not as the rest of man extortioners v ust a r diculous affectation of an obsol te vvord aduo t re s as also these papists fearing the remission of my sins or the certainty of my saluation but am vvel assured therof and of christs ovvne righteousnes too and so forth how false and idle this obiection is it hath appeared alreadie we haue not assurance either at the first or at all ordinarily but with some doubting now and then and here note that the church of rome in the doctrine of iustification by faith cuts off the principal partand propertie thereof for in iustifying faith two things are required first knowledge reuealed in the word touching the meanes of saluation secondly an applying of things knowne vnto our selues which some call affiance now the first they acknowledge so then by m perkins ovvne confession catholikes haue true knowledge of the means of saluation d en h and his fellovves erre miserably papists acknowledge in generall the meanes of saluation namely the mercie of god in christ but they faile much both in the true vnderstanding of that they hold and in diverse particulars necessarily belonging to the truth of that doctrine but the second which is the very substance and principall part thereof they denie catholikes teach man also to haue a firme hope and a great confidence of obtaining saluation through the mercy of god and me ts of christs passion so they performe their duty towards god and their neighbour or else die with true repentance but for a man at his first conuersion to ass e himselfe by saith of christs righteousnes and life euerlasting without condition of doing those things he ought to doe that we catholikes affirme to be not any gift of faith but the haynous crime of presumption which is a sinne against the holy ghost not pardonable neither in this life nor in the world to come neither doe we teach any such assurance as this man so oft harps vpon and if wee did it cannot be a sinne against the holy ghost being of ignorance and not of malice reason iii the iudgement of the auncient church august i demaund now dost thou beleeue in christ o sinner thou saist i beleeue what beleeuest thou that all thy sinnes may freely bee pardoned by him thou hast that which thou hast beleeued m perkins third reason is drawne from the consent of the auncient church of which for fashion sake to make some shew he often speaketh but can seldome find any one sentence in them that f s his purpose as you may see in this sentence of saint augustine cited by him augustine saith j demaund novv dost thou beleeue in christ o sinner thou sa st j beleeue vvhat beleeuest thou that all thy sinnes may freely be pardoned by him thou h st that vvhich thou beleeuest see here is neither applying of christs righteousnes vnto vs by faith nor so much as beleeuing our sinnes to be pardoned through him but that they may be pardoned by him so there is not one word for perkins aug de verbis dom ser there is this for master perkins though you will not see it that hee which beleeues in christ for the pardon of sins hath that which he beleeues that is vpon this faith is pardoned bernard the apostle thinketh that a man is iustified freely by faith if thou beleeuest that thy sinnes cannot bee remitted but by him alone against whom they were committed but go further and beleeue this too that by him thy sinnes are forgiuen thee this is the testimonie which the holy ghost giueth in the heart saying thy sinnes are forgiuen thee but s bernard saith plainly that vve must beleeue that our sinnes are pardoned vs but he addeth not by the imputed righteousnes of christ againe he addeth conditions on our part which m perkins crastelie concealeth for s bernard graunteth that we may beleeue our sinnes to bee forgiuen if the trueth of our conuersion meete with the mercy of god preuenting vs for in the same place he hath these words so therefore shall his mercy dwell in our earth that is the grace of god in our soules if mercy and truth meete together if iustice and peace embrace and kisse each other which is as s bernard there expoundeth it if we stirred vp by the grace of god doe truely bewaile our sinnes and confesse them and afterward follow holinesse of life and peace all which m perkins did wisely cut off because it dashed cleane the vaine glosse of the former words the point in question is not whether wee must beleeue that our sinnes are pardoned which is all you gather out of that testimonie but whether the faith which iustifieth be a particular faith whereby wee applie to our selues the promises of righteousnes and life euerlasting by christ master perkins prooues it to be such a faith by the iudgement of berna ser de annuntiat bernard in citing wherof first the printer did him wrong by leauing out these words thou doest well which are the consequent part of the sentence and without which there is no sense in it as any man may see that reades it this which is strange in a man so desirous to cauill you passe ouer and omitting the principall matter for which this place of bernard was alleaged goe about to answere that which master perkins vrgeth not namely that we are not iustified by the imputed righteousnes of christ neither doth he for that purpose bring this testimonie but to shew what that faith is by which wee are iustified secondly you accuse master perkins for cutting off certaine conditions added on our part by bernard but where are these conditions added the words you alleage are aboue thirtie lines after those that he cites and depend not vpon them but are spoken concerning the certaintie of saluation so therefore saith bernard doth this glorie viz the inward glorie and witnes of our conscience as in the words immediatly before dwell here in our earth if mercie and truth meete together and righteousnes and peace kisse each other for it is necessarie that the truth of our conuersion meete with mercie preuenting it and that afterward we follow holinesse and peace without which no man shall see god this and such like sentences declare that it is in vaine for a man to promise himselfe iustification without sanctification but they answere not the former testimonie which shewes that iustifying faith is a particular applying of christ by beleeuing the forgiuenes of our sinnes sermon de natal cyprian god promiseth thee immortalitie when thou goest out of this world and doest thou doubt this is indeede not to know god and this is for a member of the church in the house of faith not to haue faith if we beleeue in christ let vs beleeue his words and promises and wee shall neuer die and shall come to christ with ioyfull securitie with him to raigne for euer s cyprian encourageth good christians dying to haue a full confidence in the promises of christ and so doe all catholikes and bidde them be secure too on that side that christ will neuer faile of his word and promise but say that the cause of feare lies in our owne infi mities and yet bids them not to doubt as though they were as likely to be condemned as saued but animats them and puts them in the good way of hope by twenty kinds of reasons cyprian ser de natal cyprian affirmes confidently that god hath promised euery true christian immortalitie when he goes out of the world so that if hee beleeue this promise and rest vpon god for the performance of it by christ he shall certainly be made partaker of it your comfort is so cold that a man were as good be without it when his hope shall depend especially vpon the good vse of his owne free will in beleeuing and keeping the law of christ m perkins hauing thus confirmed his owne party why doth he not after his manner confute those reasons which the catholikes alleadge in fauor of their assertion was it because they are not wont to produce any in this matter nothing lesse it was then beli e because he knew not how to answere them i will out of their from take that one principall of the testimony of holy scripture and by that alone ly proue that the faith required to iustification is that catholike faith whereby we beleeue all that to be true which by god is reuealed and not any other particular beleeuing christs righteousnes to be ours it should seeme the reason was that hauing as he said before prooued our opinion to be true he doth but adde a argument or two to his former proofe for that it was easie for him to answere those you bring i hope it shall be manifest to all man at the least it had not been hard for him to chuse out some that he could haue answered how can this be better knowne then if we see weigh and consider well what kinde of faith that was which all they had who are saide in scriptures to be iustified by their faith your reason is thus to be framed if the faith of all them who are said in scripture to be iustified by faith was a beleefe of the truth of all that which was reueiled by god and not any other particular beleeuing christs righteousnes to be theirs then iustifying faith is so but the faith of all them who are said in scripture to be iustified by faith was a beleefe of the truth of all which by god is reueiled ampc therefore a iustifying faith is a beleefe of all that which is reueiled by god and not any other particular beleeuing christs righteousnes to be theirs first we must remember that wee speake of that faith by which they were iustified for else the consequence of the proposition may be doubted of this being vnderstood i denie the assumption and to the proofe of it i answere first in generall that your examples are either effects of iustifying faith or the way and meanes to it but not the faith it selfe s paul saith of noe that he was instituted heire of the iustice which is by faith what faith had he that by christs righteousnes he was assured of saluation no such matter but beleeue that god according to his word and iustice would drowne the world and made an arke to saue himselfe and his familie as god commaunded him secondly i say for the particulars that this was not the faith by which heb noe was iustified for it is apparant that he gen was iustified before he beleeued that god would drown the world adde hereunto that this faith of his was also a resting vpon god for safetie according to his promise the apostle in this and the like propounds not the meanes of iustification but some notable effect of faith neither doth he declare what this righteousnes of faith was but saith that the righteousnes of faith remained as lyra ad heb lyra expounds it in him onely and his children in which respect he is called the heire of it chrysost ad heb chrysostom saith by this he appeared to be iust because he beleeued god abraham the father of beleeuers and the paterne and example of iustice by faith as the apostle disputeth to the romans what he was iustified by let s paul declare who of him and his faith hath these words he contrary to hope beleeued in hope that he might be made the father of manie nation according to that which vvas said vnto him so shall thy seed be as the starres of heauen and the sands of the sea and he vvas not vveakened in faith neither did he consider his ovvne body novv quite dead vvhereas he vvas almost an hundred yeares old not the dead matrice of sara in the promise of god he staggered not by distrust but vvas strengthned in saith giuing glorie to god most fully knovving that vvha soe e he promised he vvas able also to doe therfore vvas it reputed to him to iustice loe because he glorified god in beleeuing that old and barren persons might haue children if god said the word and that whatsoeuer god promised he was able to performe he was iustified od abraham i answere as of noe that he was iustisied long before god made him that promise yes sander de before hee came out of the land of canaan for heb by faith he obeyed god when he was called to goe out into a place which he should afterwards receiue for inheritance and this faith of his was not a bare beleeuing that which god spake but a resting vpon him accordingly and so was that the rom apostle speakes of whereby god was especially glorified for this reposing himselfe vpon god argued the account he made of the fauour of god to him now the beleefe in that promise was not only for the maltiplying of his naturall seede but for saluation by christ to his spirituall children that p should beleeue as he had done and therefore it is called the gal gospel that he beleeued this rom faith was counted to him for righteousnes as euery act is whereby a man beleeuing in christ rests vpon the promise of god but the particular thing that is accepted to his iustification is his beleeuing in god for iustification by iesus christ i will vse no other proofe but the phrase it selfe to beleeue in god which necessarily implies a relying vpon god for that wee desire being promised the centurions faith was very pleasing vnto our sauiour who said in commendation of it that he had not found so great faith in israell what faith vvas that mary that he could with a word cure his servant absent say the vvord only quote he and my servant shall be healed the centurions faith was not a iustifying faith but a meanes to it begotten in him by the consideration of our sauiours power in working miracles though i doubt not but from this beleefe he was raised by god to a true faith for iustification by the messias but this in it selfe was no more than marc math the diuels haue acknowledging christs power s peters faith so much magnified by the auncient fathers and highlie rewarded by our sauiour was it any other then that our sauiour was christ the son of the liuing god s peters confession matth in that place was no more in words but of christs office thou article christ and his nature the son of the liuing god but if he had not also by faith rested on him to iustification this confession would haue done him but little pleasure for luke satan himselfe beleeues as much and is damned and briefly let s john that great secretary of the holy ghost tell vs what faith is the finall end of the whole gospell these things saith he are vvriten that you may beleeue that iesus christ is the son of god and that beleeuing you may haue life in his name doth the preaching of the gospell aime at nothing else then what shall become of holinesse of life and good workes made by you the matter of your second iustification this is not the last end of the gospell but the first and by this the other is wrought we must beleeue that iesus christ is the son of god so that by beleeuing this we come to him that is ioah beleeue in him or rest vpon him for saluation and thereby attaine to euerlasting life with the euangelist the apostle s paul accordeth very well saying this is the vvord of faith vvhich vve preach for if thou confesse with thy mouth our lord iesus christ and shalt beleeue in thy hart that god raysed him from death thou shall be saued and in another place i make knowne vnto you the gospell vvhich i haue preached and by vvhich you shall be saued vnlesse perhaps you haue beleeued in vaine what was that gospell j haue deliuered vnto you that vvhich i haue receiued that christ died for our according to the scriptures vvas buried and rose againe the third day ampc so by the verdite of s paul the beleefe of the articles of the cre d is that iustifying faith by which you must be saued such is the testimonie of paul for it is more than apparant that a man may beleeue in his heart that god raised christ from the death and yet denie many necessarie heads of religion and be wholy cast away but the apostle in this implies the rest and namely that rom which followes beleeuing in god that is if i may so often repeate the same thing resting vpon him for iustification by our sauiour iesus christ the same answere i make to the other place the point of the resurrection is of necessitie to be beleeued of as many as looke to be saued but that is not all that is required for if it be neither your preparations to iustification nor your merits after iustification are to any purpose and neither in s paul nor any other place of holy scriptures is it once taught that a particular faith whereby we apply christs righteousnes to our selues and assure our selues of our saluation is either a iustifying or any christian mans faith but the very naturall act of that ougly monster presumption which being laid as the very corner stone of the protestant irreligion what morall and modest conuersation what humility and deuotion can they build vpon it all those places that require of vs faith in christ teach vs also that a particular faith whereby we applie christ to our selues by trusting to him for iustification is the only proper iustifying faith because to it nothing can be added for the matter of beleeuing a man may acknowledge that credere deum there is a god and giue credere deo credit as to a certaine truth to all that god reueales and yet not credere in deum beleeue in god to iustification but he that performes this latter must needs also acknowledge the former this then being the height of faith is in the scripture counted a iustifying faith the ii difference touching faith in the act of iustification is this the papist saith we are iustified by faith because it disposeth a sinner to his iustification after this manner by faith saith he the mind of man is inlightened in the knowledge of the law and gospell knowledge stirres vp a feare of hell with a consideration of the promise of happinesse as also the loue and feare of god and hope of life eternall now when the heart is thus prepared god infuseth the habite of charitie and other vertues whereby a sinner is iustified before god we say otherwise that faith iustifieth because it is a supernaturall instrument created by god in the heart of man at his conuersion whereby hee apprehendeth and receiueth christs righteousnesse for his iustification the second difference in the manner of iustification is about the formall act of faith which m perkins handleth as it were by the way cuttedly i will be as short as he the matter not being great the catholiks reach as you haue heard out of the councell of trent in the beginning of this question that many actes of faith feare hope and charity do goe before our iustification preparing our soule to receiue into it from god through christ that great grace if the matter be not great it was but a small fault to be short in it yes the contrarie had been a fault indeed it is not handled by the way but propounded in plaine tearmes as a second difference between vs and you m perkins doctor like resolueth otherwise that faith is an instrument created by god in the hart of man at his conuersion vvhereby he apprehendeth and receiueth christs righteousnes for his iustification this ioyly description is set downe without any other probation then his owne authoritie that deliuered it and so let it passe as already sufficiently confuted and if there needed any other disprofe of it i might gather one more out of his owne explication of it where he saith that the couenant of grace is communicated vnto vs by the word of god and by the sacraments for if faith created in our harts be the only sufficient supernaturall instrument to apprehend that couenant of grace then there needs no sacraments for that purpose and consequentlie i would faine know by the way how little infants that cannot for want of iudgement and discretion haue any such act of faith as to lay hold on christ his iustice are iustified must we without any warrant in god word contrary to all experience beleeue that they haue this act of faith before they come to any vnderstanding if it would haue serued your turne to cauil at you would haue found master perkins reason and not haue iested at his authoritie i will plainly propound it for all man to iudge of your dealing that ioh amp whereby christ is to be receiued is an instrument to applie christ but faith is that whereby christ is to be receiued therefore faith is an instrument to applie christ to this you answere nothing but frame an argument against the question as you would haue it thought out of master perkins his owne explication of it your argument is if faith created in our hearts be the onely sufficient supernaturall instrument to apprehend the couenant of grace then there need no sacraments you should adde as supernaturall instruments to that purpose but there is need of the sacraments therefore faith is not the onely sufficient supernaturall instrument to apprehend the couenant of grace first there is more in your conclusion than in the question the question is whether faith be a supernaturall instrument created to that purpose or no your conclusion is that faith is not that onely supernaturall instrument secondly i denie the consequence of your proposition you may as well say for that master perkins sets downe too that if faith be the onely instrument then the word is needlesse the word and sacraments applie christ outwardlie as meanes on god part faith receiues it in on our part the holie ghost inlightening and inclining our hearts thereunto little infants in my poore opinion haue no act of faith but are iustified without any thing done by them god for christs sake according to his euerlasting election forgiuing their sinnes and adopting them for sonnes and heires of glorie in this their doctrine is a twofold error i that they make faith which iustifieth to go before iustification it selfe both for order of nature and also for time whereas by the word of god at the very instant when any man beleeueth first he is then iustified and sanctified for he that beleeueth eateth and drinketh the bodie and blood of christ and is alreadie passed from death to life ioh but to returne vnto the sound doctrine of our catholike faith m perkins finds two faults with it one that we teach faith to goe before iustification whereas by the word of god saith he at the very instant when any man beleeueth first he is then both iustified and sanctified what word of god so teacheth marry this he that beleeueth eateth and drinketh the body and blood of christ and is alreadie passed from death to life i answere that our sauiour in that text speaketh not of beleeuing but of eating his bodie in the blessed sacrament which who so receiueth worthely obtaineth therby life euerlasting as christ saith expressely in that place and so this proofe is vaine if you had meant plainly you should haue reported master perkins reproofe of your opinion truly as he hath deliuered it that you make faith goe before iustification not onely in order of nature onely which we grant but in time also which we denie if i should onely say the contrarie ioh that our sauiour doth not speake there of the sacraments i might conclude by as good

beleeue vvithout a preacher ampc where there is this order set downe to arriue vnto iustification first to heare the preacher then to beleeue afterwards to call vpon god for mercy and finally mercie is graunted and giuen in iustification so that prayer goeth betweene faith and iustification rom prayer commeth betweene in nature but not in time for hee that rests vpon god for saluation in christ doth withall call vpon god for pardon of his sinnes whereupon iustification followes immediatly though not alwaies in a mans owne feeling this s augustine obserued when he said faith is giuen first by which vve obtaine the rest and againe by the lavv is knovvledge of s nne by faith vve obtaine grace and by grace our soule is cured the rest that aug de praedest cap austin speakes of are graces of sanctification or as he calles them there good workes in which we liue and these are supplied euery day by god or at least the increase and vse of these vertues whereby wee liue godly in the world such is the cure of y e soule by grace to the louing of righteousnes and doing the works of the law if we list to see the practise of this recorded in holy writ read the second of the acts and there you shall find how that the people hauing heard s peters sermon were stroken to the hearts and beleeued yet were they not straight way iustified but asked of the apostles what they must doe who willed them to doe penance and to be baptized in the name of iesus in remission of their sinnes and then loe they were iustified so that penance and baptisme went betweene their faith and their iustification those man act s luke there speaks of were not yet come to a iustifying faith when they askt the apostle what they should doe no nor to the knowledge of the gospell but onely to verse a sight of their owne sinnes in consenting to the murthering of christ in like manner queene candaces eunuch hauing heard s philip it is kindly to haue as vvell strange vvord as strange doctrines act act announcing vnto him christ beleeued that iesus christ was the son of god no talke in those daies of applying vnto himselfe christs righteousnes yet was he not iustified before descending out of his chariot he was baptized and three daies passed betweene s paules conuersion and his iustification as doth euidently appeare by the history of his conuersion the act eunuch had heard the gospell expounded out of isaiah esay and namely that man were to be iustified by the acknowledging of christ his desire of baptisme was a proofe of his faith according to that he had learned and baptisme rom the seale of his pardon or iustification vpon that his beleefe of forgiuenes by christs sufferings it appeares by the act storie that there were three daies between the vision and the baptisme of the apostle but it is not any way shewed that hee had iustifying faith the first day and yet was not iustified till the third day it is but your conceit that tie iustification to baptisme the second is that faith being nothing else with them but an illumination of the minde stirreth vp the will which being mooued and helped causeth in the heart many spirituall motions and thereby disposeth man to his future iustification but this indeede is as much as if wee should say that dead man onely helped can prepare themselues to their future resurrection for we are all by nature dead in sinne and therefore must not onely bee inlightened in minde but also renewed in will before wee can so much as will or desire that which is good now we as i haue said teach otherwise that faith iustifieth as it is an instrument to apprehend and applie christ with his obedience which is the matter of our iustification this is the truth i prooue it thus in the couenant of grace two things must be considered the substance thereof and the condition the substance of the couenant is that righteousnesse and life euerlasting is giuen to god church and people by christ the condition is that wee for our parts are by faith to receiue the foresaid benefits and this condition is by grace as well as the substance now then that wee may attaine to saluation by christ hee must bee giuen vnto vs really as hee is propounded in the tenour of the foresaid couenant and for the giuing of christ god hath appointed speciall ordinances as the preaching of the word and the administration of the sacraments the word preached is the power of god to saluation to euery one that beleeues and the end of the sacraments is to communicate christ with all his benefits to them that come to bee partakers thereof as is most plainely to bee seene in the supper of the lord in which the giuing of bread and wine to the seuerall communicants is a pledge and signe of god particular giuing of christs bodie and blood with all his merits vnto them and this giuing on god part cannot bee effectuall without receiuing on our parts and therfore faith must needs bee an instrument or hand to receiue that which god giueth that wee may finde comfort by this giuing the second fault he findeth with our faith is that we take it to be nothing else but an illumination of the mind stirring vp the will which being so moued and helped by grace causeth in the heart many good spirituall motions but this sayes m perkins is as much to say that dead man only helped can prepare themselues to their resurrection not so good sir but that man spiritually dead being quickned by god spirit may haue many good motions for as our spirit giueth life vnto our body so the spirit of god by his grace animateth and giueth life vnto our soules but of this it hath been once before spoken at large in the question of free will is not the latter your doctrine also that a man vpon those good motions inspired disposeth himselfe to iustification by the good vse of his free will let the concil trid sess cap councill of trent be iudge as your selfe alleaged it before the iii difference concerning faith is this the papist saith that a man is iustified by faith yet not by faith alone but also by other vertues as hope loue the feare of god ampc the reasons which are brought to maintaine their opinion are of no moment reason i luke many sinnes are forgiuen her particula non causalis sed illatiua vel rationalis because she loued much whence they gather that the woman here spoken of was iustified and had the pardon of sinnes by loue ans in this text loue is not made an impulsiue cause to mooue god to pardon her sinnes but onely a signe to shew and manifest that god had alreadie pardoned them like to this is the place of john who saith ioh wee are translated from death to life because we loue the brother where loue is no cause of the change but a signe and consequent thereof obserue first that catholikes do not teach that she was pardoned for loue alone for they vse not as protestant do when they find one cause of iustification to exclude all or any of the rest but considering that in sundrie places of holy write iustification is ascribed vnto many seuerall vertues affirme that not faith alone but diverse other diuine qualities concurre vnto iustification and as mention here made of loue excludeth not faith hope repentance and such like so in other places where faith is only spoken of there hope charity and the rest must not also be excluded this sinner had assured beleefe in christs power to remit sinnes and great hope in his mercie that hee would forgiue them great sorrow and detestation of her sinne also she had that in such an assemblie did so humblie prostrate her selfe at christs feete to wash them with her teares and to wipe them with the haires of her head and as she had true repentance of her former life so no doubt but she had also a firme purpose to lead a new life so that in her conuersion all those vertues meete together which we hold to concurre to iustification and among the rest the preheminence worthelie is giuen to loue as to the principall disposition shee loued our sauiour as the fountaine of all mercies and goodnes and therfore accounted her precious oyntments best bestowed on him yes and the humblest seruice and most affectionate she could offer him to be all too little and nothing answerable to the inward burning charitie which she bare him which noble affection of hers towards her diuine redeemer no question was most acceptable vnto him as by his ovvne vvord is most manifest for he said that many sinnes vvere forgiuen her because she loued much but m perkins saith that her loue vvas no cause that moued christ to pardon her but onely a signe of pardon giuen before vvhich is so contrary to the text that a man not past all shame vvould blush once to affirme it in stead of answering your long discourse grounded vpon meere coniectures for the most part which for the womans sake i will not examine let me put you in minde that if all this you report of her were true she was iustified before these actions which could not proceede but from a great measure of grace especially such an inward burning charitie as is not easily to be found in many a one that hath been iustified a long time first christ saith expresly that it vvas the cause of the pardon because she had loued much master perkins hath answered you that our sauiour saith not so and hath prooued his answere by the like place of ioh s john where the same word is vsed and no cause propounded but a signe onely would you not haue taken away this answer if you had could but the text it self cleeres the matter first by luke verse vers verse the parable propounded with simons answer and our sauiours approbation then by the application of it lastly by the general doctrine gathered out of it to whom a little is forgiuen he doth loue a little to this purpose basil de baptismo basil saith that he that owes much hath much forgiuen him that he may loue much more secondly that her loue vvent before is as plainelie declered both by mention of the time past because she hath loued and by the dence of her fact of vvashing wiping and anoynting his feete for h vvhich saith our sauiour then already performed many si are forgiuen her so that here can be no impediment of beleeuing the catholike doctrine so clearely deliuered by the holy ghost vnlesse one vvill bee so blindly ledde by our nevv masters that he vvill beleeue no vvords of christ be they neuer so plaine othervvise then it please the ministers to expound them and this much of the first of those reasons which m perkins said vvere of no moment the mention of the time past is too weake a reason to ouerthrow so certaine proofe out of the whole course of the text especially since that notable conclusion is deliuered immediatly vpon the former words in the present time to whom a little is forgiuen he doth loue a little neither doth our sauiour tie the pardon of her sinnes to that present time but then giueth her knowledge of that which was done before saying first to simon many sinnes are forgiuen her and then to her selfe thy sinnes are forgiuen thee reason ii gal neither circumcision nor vncircumcision auaileth any thing but faith that worketh by loue hence they gather that faith doth iustifie together with loue ans the propertie of true faith is to apprehend and receiue something vnto it selfe and loue that goes alwaies with faith as a fruite and an vnseparable companion thereof is of an other nature for it doth not receiue in but as it were giue out it selfe in all the duties of the first and second table towards god and man and this thing faith by it selfe cannot doe and therefore paul saith that faith worketh by loue the hand hath a property to reach out it selfe to lay hold of any thing and to receiue a gift but the hand hath no propertie to cut a peece of wood of it selfe without saw or knife or some like instrument and yet by helpe of them it can either deuide or cut euen so it is the nature of faith to goe out of it selfe and to receiue christ into the heart as for the duties of the first and second table faith cannot of it selfe bring them forth no more then the hand can deuide or cut yet ioyne loue to faith and then can it practise duties commanded concerning god and man and this i take to be the meaning of this text which speaketh not of iustification by faith but onely of the practise of common duties which faith putteth in execution by the helpe of loue reply that charity hath the chiefest part and that faith is rather the instrument and hand ma id of charity my proofe shall be out of the very text alleadged vvhere life and motion is giuen to faith by charity as the greeke vvord euergoumene being passiue doth plainely shevv that faith is moued led and guided by charity gal the greek word is not of the passiue but of the middle voyce as it is in many other places of scriptures rom the affections of the flesh did worke in our members operabantur in your own translation corinthian death workes in vs but life in you operatur ephesian according to the power that worketh in vs operatur column according to his working which he worketh in me quam operatur in me and in this very place operatur which cannot be taken passiuely as euery grammar scholler knoweth in the interlinear faith which is effi ax effectuall pagnin agens working by loue faith saith theophyl ad gal theophylact on that place workes by loue that is saith he ought alwaies viuax amp efficax commonstrari to be shewed to be aliue and effectuall by loue to christ and a little after learne therefore that faith worketh by charitie that is saith he is shewed to be aliue lombard thomas caietan catharin d b p the place is of vvorkes not of charity the best of your owne writers expound it as we doe which s iames doth demonstrate most manifest saying that euen as the body is dead without the soule so is faith vvithout charity making charitie to be the life and as it vvere the soule of faith novv no man is ignorant but it is the soule that vseth the body as an instrument euen so then it is charity that vseth saith as her instrument and inferiour and not contrarivvise first the word iam in that place doth not signifie the soule but breath as caietan saith secondly the apostle saith not without charitie as you doe but sine operibus without workes which cannot be taken for the life of faith but are onely effects of it thirdly for the meaning of the place let vs here your owne cardinall caietan speake by the name of spiritus spirit saith caietan he vnderstands not the soule but the breath and he fitly compareth workes to breath for as the body of a liuing creature sinon spirat if it breathe not is dead so faith sinon parit opus if it bring foorth no workes is dead for breathing is an effect of a liue bodie and likewise working is the proper effect of a liuing faith whereby it appeareth saith he in what sense iam the apostle said aboue that faith without workes was dead not because hee thought that works were the forme of faith but because he thought that works concomitantia fidem accompany faith as the breath accompanieth the life of the bodie you see both his iudgement and his reason which is confirmed by that the iam apostle said before faith if it haue not workes is dead so that the meaning is faith without workes that is faith that hath not workes is dead which s paul confirmeth at large in the vvhole chapter prouing charitie to be a more excellent gift then faith or any other concluding vvith these vvords novv there remaineth faith hope and charity these three but the greater of these is charitie whereupon s augustine resolueth thus nothing but charity maketh faith it selfe auaileable for faith saith he may be vvithout charity but it cannot be auailable vvithout it so that first you see that charitie is the mouer and commaunder and faith as her instrument and handmaid the corinthian apostle speaketh not of that faith by which wee beleeue in god to iustification but of that by which miracles are wrought besides it doth not follow that loue vseth faith as an instrument to iustifie vs because in some respect it is superiour namely in the present vse for the good of our brother to which the apostles exhortation tends as it y appeare by his discourse both in that chapter and in the going before and the that followeth austin bringing the apostles words speaketh of the same faith that hee meant which may be indeed without charitie and cannot rise to the height of a iustifying faith but must needs be accompanied by charitie without which it is dead now that in the worke of iustification it hath the chiefe place may be thus proued i demaund whether that worke of iustification by faith be done for the loue of god and to his honour or no if not as it is void of charity so it is a wicked and sinfull act no iustification but infection our owne interest being the principall end of it now if it comprehend and conclude god glory and seruice in it that is if they apply christs righteousnes to them to glorifie god thereby then hath charity the principall part therin for the directing of all to the honor and glory of god is the proper office and action of charity there is neither reason in your question nor strength in your argument the worke of iustification by faith is god action iustifying a sinner that beleeueth in iesus christ what sense then is there in this question i demaund whether that work of iustificatio by faith be done for the loue of god and to his honour or no that which followeth in respect of god is blasphemous at least absurd that the worke of iustification is a wicked act to your reason it is no wicked act to beleeue in god for iustification by christ though in the particular act of beleeuing we thinke not vpon the glorifying of god but onely respect our owne saluation for to beleeue in christ is no act enioyned by the law of nature or of moses whereby we should iustifie our selues but an extraordinarie matter appointed by god who respects nothing in it on our parts but that wee beleeue not as if we might therefore neglect the glorie of god but that we may afterward giue so much the more glorie to him the lesse cause there was he should pardon vs there being such a defect against our generall dutie in that act of beleeuing further if it were true that we desired to glorifie god by beleeuing in christ and that that desire proceeded from loue yet had not loue either the principall or any part in procuring our iustification because god doth not iustifie vs for seeking to glorifie him by beleefe which is simply a worke of the law but onely accepteth ioh our beleeuing for working and as rom the apostle speaketh counts faith to vs for righteousnes all this reason that charity both concurreth to iustification and that as principall s augustine confirmeth in these words the house of god that is a righteous and godly soule hath for his foundation faith hope is the vvalles of it but charitie is the roofe and perfection of it austin speaketh not of iustification onely but of the whole building of god house in the soule of man which aug de verbis apostoli ser saith he is built with singing founded with beleeuing set vp with hoping perfected with louing the end of our election iustification and sanctification is holinesse without which a man is no true christian but iustification is not the building of the soule reason iii faith is neuer alone therfore it doth not iustifie alone answer the reason is naught and they might as well dispute thus the eie is neuer alone from the heade and therfore it seeth not alone which is absurd and though in regard of substance the eye be neuer alone yet in regard of seeing it is alone and so though faith subsist not without loue and hope and other graces of god yet in regard of the act of iustification it is alone without them all the third of these trifling reasons is peruersly propounded by m perkins thus faith is neuer alone therefore it dothnot iustifie alone that this argument is fondly framed appeareth plainly in that that catholikes doe not deny but affirme that faith may be without charity as it is in all sinfull catholikes the argument is framed vpon our opinion who maintaine that a iustifying faith is neuer without hope and charitie hence it may seeme to follow that it doth not iustifie alone but because you disclaime this reason i will let it passe we then forme the reason thus if faith alone be the whole cause of iustification then if both hope and charity were remoued from faith at least by thought and in conceipt faith would neuerthelesse iustifie but faith considered without hope and charity will not iustifie ergo it is not the whole cause of iustification the first proposition cannot be denied of them who know the nature and propriety of causes for the entire and totall cause of any thing being as the philosophers say in act the effect must needs follow and very sence teacheth the simple that if any thing be set to worke and if it doe not act that which it is set too then there wanted some thing requisite and consequently that vvas not the whole cause of that worke i denie the consequence of your proposition for though saith alone be the whole cause of iustification yet not euery faith but such an one as is accompanied with hope and charitie to your proofe i answere that such a faith is neither the whole nor any cause of iustification and so though that be as you say in act yet no such effect will follow now to the second proposition but their imagined faith cannot applie to themselues christs righteousnes vvithout the preseace of hope and charitie for else he might be iustified without any hope of heauen and without any loue towards god and estimation of his honor which are things most absurd in themselues but yet very well fitting the protestant iustification which is nothing els but the plaine vice of presumption as hath been before declared yet to auoid this inconuenience which is so great m perkins graunteth that both hope and charity must needs be present at the iustification but doe nothing in it but faith doth all as the head is present to the eie when it seeth yet it is the eie alone that seeth here is a worthy peece of philosophie that the eie alone doth see wheras in truth it is but the instrument of seeing the soule being the principall cause of sight as it is of all other actions of life sence and reason and it is not to purpose here where we require the prefence of the whole cause and not only of th instrumentall cause to the assumption i answere faith considered without any act of hope or charitie to iustification doth iustifie but faith that is without these doth not iustifie to your proofe i say further y t to our iustification god accounteth for righteousnes neither our hope of heauen nor our loue towards himselfe nor our estimation of his honour but rom onely our beleeuing in iesus christ the similitude is true and fit true because the eye doth see though as an instrument fitted to that office by god and thus philosophers poets orators and all kinde of people doe speake he that would be more curious than wise might finde fault with you also and say that the act of seeing also is mans and the soule the instrustrument whereby he doth see as the hand is the instrument with which he reacheth the fitnes of the similitude appeareth thus it is man that beleeueth as it is man that seeth the generall instrument as i may speake for both these actions is the soule though by diverse faculties the particular for sight is the eye for beleeuing faith outwardly there is none the eye seuered from the head seeth not and yet it is the eye that seeth and not the head so saith that is without hope and charitie iustifieth not and yet hope and charitie doth not iustifie you answere that it is not to purpose because wee require the presence of the whole cause and not onely of the instrumentall but you deceiue your selfe for the question is not of the whole cause or principall efficient which is god for rom it is he onely that iustifieth but of the instrument if wee may so call it to speake plainly the matter is as i haue often said what it is that god respects in vs to our iustification we say it is onely our beleeuing in christ you say it is our beleeuing louing and hoping because we teach that together with faith by which on our part we are iustified we receiue hope charitie and other graces of sanctification which are all present in the heart when it beleeueth to iustification but are no way any causes of it and to returne your similitude vpon yourselfe as the eie cannot see without the head because it receiueth influence from it before it can see so cannot faith iustifie without charity because it necessarily receiueth spirit of life from it before it can do any thing acceptable in god sight i denie your similitude as faultie in the reddition or latter part of it for faith receiueth no influence from any other vertue whereby it hath life to worke acceptably in god sight but the acceptablenes of faith proceedes from the meere acceptation of god rom counting it for righteousnes and whereas wee say that such a faith onely iustifieth as hath hope and loue for companions it is not our meaning that these make saith acceptable but that hee which beleeueth and hath not these vertues idly presumes of faith when he hath it not because the spirit of god together with true faith powreth these graces also into our soules but of this whole point of iustification i shall one day if it please god write more distinctly and fully reason iv if faith alone doe iustifie then wee are saued by faith alone but we are not saued by faith alone and therfore not iustified by faith alone answer the proposition is false for more things are requisit to the maine ende then to the subordinate meanes the fourth reason if faith alone doe iustifie then faith alone vvill saue but it will not saue ergo m perkins first denieth the proposition and saith that it may iustifie and yet not saue because more is required to saluation then to iustification which is false for put the case that an innocent babe dye shortly after his baptisme wherein he was iustified shall he not be saued for want of any thing i hope you will say yes euen so any man that is iustified if he depart in that state no man makes doubt of his saluation therefore this first shift was very friuolous it had been the part of a scholler to haue refuted his reason as well as to condemne his answere but indeede the reason is sound that iustification being but the subordinate meanes to the maine end saluation more is required to this than to that not that any man can faile of saluation rom which hath attained to iustification but because god hath appointed to make supplie of other graces that we may come by degrees to glorification your reason is nothing worth for the comparison of equalitie and likenes is insufficient for though infants need no more to saluation yet man of discretion doe i appeale to your owne doctrine doe not you teach that good workes are necessarie to saluation and yet you grant that infants may be saued without them yes and man of yeres too if they haue no time to doe them after their first iustification therefore more may bee required to saluation than to iustification though infants want nothing after they are once iustified yes infants are iustified without faith as many as are iustified and the assumption is false for we are saued by faith alone if wee speake of faith as it is an instrument apprehending christ for our saluation which m perkins perceiuing flies to a second that for faith alone we shall also be saued and that good workes shall not be regarded at the day of our iudgement then must those words of the holy ghost so often repeated in the scriptures be razed out of the text god at that time vvill render vnto euery man according to his workes but of this more amply in the question of merits his second answere is that the assumption is false vpon this distinction that by sauing wee vnderstand being brought into the state of saluation for that is performed on our part by beleeuing onely now in this case wee are said to bee saued because whosoeuer is once iustified by saith shall certainly haue other things ministred vnto him by which god hath appointed to bring him to saluation it is your slander not master perkins error that good works shall not be regarded at the day of our iudgement reason v we are saued by hope therefore not by faith alone answer we are saued by hope not because it is any cause of our saluation pauls meaning is onely this that wee haue not saluation as yet in possession but waite patiently for it in time to come to be possessed of vs expecting the time of our ful deliuerance that is all that can iustly be gathered hence there be many other vertues vnto which iustification and saluation are ascribed in god word therefore faith alone sufficeth not the antecedent is proued first offeare it is said he that is vvithout feare cannot be iustified vve are saued by hope vnlesse you doe psnance you shall all in like sort perish vve are translated from death to life that is iustified because vve loue the brother againe of baptisme vnlesse you be borne againe of vvater and the holy ghost you cannot enter into the kingdome of heauen lastly we must haue a resolute purpose to amend our evil liues for vve are buried together with christ by baptisme into death that as christ is risen againe from the dead ampc s vve may also vvalke in nevvnes of life master perkins answered as much as hee propounded that which you haue brought i will examine and i trust satisfie ecclesiastic he that is without feare cannot be iustified it is a strange course of prouing to bring that against vs for scripture which you know wee denie to be scripture and that with the consent of the ancient writers and your owne of late interlin bibl arias montanus and they that ioyned with him haue left all the apocryphall out of the interlinear bible the greeke which is the originall is farre otherwise iracundus an angrie man and so it is translated in bibl regina hispan the great bible set out by arias montanus and before that by pa nin pagnin who also interpreteth it shall not be iustified non poterit censeri iustus cannot be thought iust referring it to mans iudgement rather than to god vatablus vatablus also so translateth it and addes in the margin that some copies reade vniust anger and for your being iustified he translateth as pagnin doth cannot be counted iust besides i denie the consequence he that is without feare cannot be iustified therefore iustification is ascribed in god word to some other vertue and not to faith onely for though a man that is without feare cannot be iustified yet he is not iustified in respect of his feare to omit the absurditie of the translation luke doe penance for repent who makes any doubt that they shall perish that repent not what will you conclude thence therefore repentance iustifieth and not faith onely i denie your consequence see the reason in the former section the ioh apostle makes not the loue of our brother the cause but the proofe of our iustification as it is apparant by his words we know we are translated from death to life because we loue the brother he that loueth not his brother abideth in death we are not translated by reason of our louing for indeed we must be translated before we can loue them but we know by louing them that we are translated and that is the scope of the apostle in this are the children of god knowne and the children of the diuell whosoeuer doth not righteousnes is not of god neither he that loueth not his brother let vs not loue in word nor in tongue but indeed and in truth for thereby wee know that we are of the truth and shall before him assure our hearts first you take that as granted which is full of doubt that our sauiour christ speaketh ioh in that place of baptisme secondly admitting that i denie absolute necessitie of baptisme as well as of the other sacrament for which in your iudgement those words are as strong ioh except you eate the flesh of the son of man and drinke his blood ye haue no life in you thirdly i say we are iustified by baptisme rom as abraham was by circumcision fourthly i denie the consequence here also none can enter into heauen except they be borne againe of water and the holy ghost therefore not onely faith but also some other vertues are respected by god in our iustification the end of baptisme is our sanctification by dying to sinne and liuing to righteousnes therefore iustification and saluation are ascribed to other vertues beside faith i denie the consequence for rom though we must haue a resolute purpose to amend our liues yet god doth not iustifie vs in regard that we haue such a purpose but only in respect of our beleeuing neither to speake truly doth this purpose goe before iustification but follow it to all these and many such like places of holy scripture it pleased m perkins to make answere in that one you are saued by hope to wit that paules meaning is only that we haue not as yet saluation in possession but must waire patiently for it vntill the time of our full deliuerance this is all now whether that patient expectation which is not hope but issueth out of hope of eternal saluation or hope it selfe be any cause of saluation he saith neither yes nor nay and leaues you to think as it seemeth best vnto your selfe s paul then affirming it to be a cause of saluation it is best to beleeue him and so neither to exclude hope or charitie or any of the foresaid vertues from the worke of iustification hauing so good warrant as the word of god for the confirmation of it rom s paul doth not affirme that it is any cause of saluation but onely saith as master perkins hath truly answered that we must come to the possession of saluation by continuing our hope of it with patience to which purpose heb the apostle saith that we had need of patience that after wee haue done the will of god we may receiue the promise neither is the question of saluation but of iustification so that here the consequence may iustly be denied we are saued by hope therfore we are not iustified by faith onely for more is required to saluation than to iustification to these authorities and reasons taken out of the holy scriptures let vs ioyne here some testimonies of the auncient church reseruing the rest vnto that place wherein m perkins citeth some for him the most auncient and most valiant martyr s ignatius of our iustification writeth thus the beginning of life is faith but the end of it is charity but both vnited and ioyned together doe make the man of god perfect there is no such word in that ignatius ad philip epistle to the philippians and if there were the matter were not great such an author as he sheweth himselfe to be that writ those epistles in ignatius name is an vnfit iudge in controuersies of diuinitie but for the sentence it selfe if it bee any where to bee found it may well be answered that sanctification is required to the perfection of a christian and not onely iustification and this is all that is here affirmed what proofe is there in this that faith onely doth not iustifie clement patriarch of alexandria saith faith goeth before but feare doth build and charity bringeth to perfection clemens stromat lib clement speaketh not either of iustification or of iustifying faith but as the former author describeth some of the meanes and as it were the parts of christian sanctification saint john chrysostom patriarch of constantinople hath these words least the faithfull should trust that by faith alone they might be saued he disputeth of the punishment of euill man and so doth he both exhort the jnfidels to faith and the faithfull to liue vvell chrysost in math homily chrysostom speakes of that faith whereby we giue assent to the truth of the gospell not of that whereby we liue in christ neither intreateth he of iustification but of saluation further hee reiecteth such a faith as hath not good workes and so doe we s augustine cryeth out as it were to our protestant and saith heare o foolish heretike and enemy to the true faith good workes vvhich that they may be done are by grace prepared and not of the merits of free will vve condemne not because by them or such like man of god haue been iustified are iustified and shall be iustified many doubt and some euen of your owne side denie that booke to be hypognost lib austins but for the sentence alleaged by you it cannot be to the purpose because our question is now onely of the first iustification as you speake to which the workes of grace that follow afterward and of which austin professedly speaketh in that place cannot belong beside there is no doubt but he speaketh as s iames doth saying that iam abraham was iustified by workes that is approued and acknowledged for iust both by god and man as a man is knowne to be aliue by his breathing and novv let vs see that vvhich is to be shaken out of the harts of the faithfull least by euill securitie they lose their saluation if they shall thinke faith alone to be sufficient to obtaine it the words immediatly following after those you haue set downe and being a part of the sentence make it manifest that aug de fide amp oper cap austin speakes of a dead faith which neglecteth good workes if they shall thinke saith he faith alone to be sufficient to obtaine it but shall neglect to liue well and hold on the way of god by good workes this as hee professeth august de doctr christ cap otherwhere he knew to be the course of some who thought that faith which saith he they faine they haue should auaile them before god without good workes and being deceiued with this kinde of error commit hainous sinnes without feare while they beleeue that god is a reuenger of no sinne but persidiae infidelitie and these were the gnostickes against whom such speeches are intended now the doctrine which wee teach on the contrarie is that a sinner is iustified before god by faith yes by faith alone the meaning is that nothing within man and nothing that man can doe either by nature or by grace concurreth to the act of iustistcation before god as any cause thereof either efficient materiall formall or finall but faith alone all other gifts and graces as hope loue the feare of god are necessarie to saluation as signes thereof and consequents of faith nothing in man concurres as any cause to this worke but faith alone and faith itselfe is no principall but onely an instrumental cause whereby wee receiue apprehend and apply christ and his righteousnesse for our iustification now the doctrine which m perkins teacheth is cleane contrary for saith he a sinner is iustified by faith alone that is nothing that man can doe by nature or grace concurreth thereto as any kind of cause but faith alone farther he saith that faith it selfe is no principall but rather an instrumentall cause vvhereby vve apprehend and applie christ and his righteousnes for our iustification so that in fine we haue that faith so much by them magnified and called the only and whole cause of our iustification is in the end become no true cause at all but a bare condition without which we cannot be iustified the doctrine master perkins teacheth is not contrarie but the very same for he holds that no man can be saued who either neglecteth or endeuoureth not to bring foorth good workes though he allow these no place as causes of a mans iustification at the last you vnderstand that wee make not faith the principall much lesse the whole cause of our iustification to speake properly wee make it no true cause at all but onely as you say a condition required by god on our part which hee accepteth in stead of fulfilling the lawe and thereupon forgiueth vs our sinnes for christs sake if it be an instrumental cause let him then declare what is the principall cause whose instrument faith is and choose vvhether he had liefer to haue charity or the soule of man vvithout any helpe of grace your disiunction is naught for neither charitie nor the soule are the principall efficients but man himselfe not without any helpe of grace but by such a speciall grace as certainly produceth that effect in vs to our iustification reason i ioh as moses lift vp the serpent in the wildernesse so must the son of man be lift vp that whosoeuer beleeueth in him shall not perish but haue eternall life in these words christ makes a comparison on this manner when any one of the israelites were stung to death by fierie serpents his cure was not by any physicke surgery but only by the casting of his eie vp to the brasen serpent which moses had erected by god commandement euen so in the cure of our soules when wee are stung to death by sinne there is nothing required within vs for our recouerie but onely that we cast vp and fixe the eie of our faith on christ and his righteousnesse but to come to his reasons the first is taken out of these vvords as moses lift vp the serpent in the desert so must the son of man be lift vp that whosoeuer beleeueth in him shall not perish but haue life euerlasting true if he liue accordingly and as his faith teacheth him but what is this to iustification by only faith mary m perkins drawes it in after this fashion as nothing was required of them who were stung by serpents but that they should looke vpon the brasen serpent so nothing is required of a sinner to deliuer him from sinne but that he cast his eyes of faith vpon christs righteousnes and applie that to himselfe in particular but this application of the similitude is only mans foolish inuention without any ground in the text similitudes be not in all points alike neither must be streatched beyond the very point wherein the similitude lieth which in this matter is that like as the israelites in the wildernesse stung with serpents were cured by looking vpon the brasen serpent so man infected with sinne haue no other remedie then to embrace the faith of christ iesus all this we confesse but to say that nothing else is necessary that is quite besides the text and as easily reiected by vs as it is by him obtruded without any authority or probability if wee precisely vrge the similitude the latter part of the reddition is no part of the comparison for there is nothing in the proposition to which it answereth but our sauiour addes the end of lifting vp himselfe to stirre vs vp as it may seeme to a more thorough consideration of the agreement between health by the serpent and saluation by him and surely it is not without reason to make a likenes in the deliuerance as well as in other points that all man might vnderstand by our sauiours speech how they should become partakers of that benefit reason ii the exclusiue formes of speech vsed in scripture prooue thus much we are iustified freely not of the law not by the law without the law without workes not of workes not according to works not of vs not by the workes of the law but by faith gal all boasting excluded onely beleeue luke these distinctions whereby workes and the lawe are excluded in the worke of iustification doe include thus much that faith alone doth iustifie it doth not so for these exclusiue speeches do not exclude feare hope and charity more then they exclude faith it self which may be called a worke of the law as well as any other vertue being as much required by the law as any other if they doe not more exclude feare hope and charitie than faith it must be shewed that they are directly or by necessarie consequence required in opposition to the workes of the law for that is very manifest of faith in diverse places rom by faith without the works of the law gal not by the works of the law but by the faith of iesus christ ephesian by the faith of christ and not by the workes of the law verse through faith not of workes but this can neuer be shewed of them by reason of the opposition i speake of faith cannot bee taken for a worke of the law neither is it any worke required by the law to beleeue in christ for iustification because the law saith leuit rom doe this and thou shalt be saued namely as an hired servant but the gospell saith i beleeue and thou shalt haue thy sinnes forgiuen thee by iustification now the law commands no sute for pardon but calles for either obedience or damnation hope indeede as i shewed before differs little from faith but depends vpon it feare and loue are proper duties of the law and so alwaies performed but s paules meaning in those places is to exclude all such workes as either iew or gentile did or could bragge of as done of themselues and so thought that by them they deserued to be made christians for he truely saith that all were concluded in sinne and needed the grace of god which they were to receiue of his free mercy through the merits of christ and not of any desert of their owne and that to obtaine this grace through christ it was not needfull nay rather hurtfull to obserue the ceremonies of moses law as circumcision the obseruation of any of their feasts or fastes nor any such like worke of the law which the lews reputed so necessary again that all morall works of the gentiles could not deserue this grace which works not proceeding from charity were nothing worth in god sight and so all workes both of iewe and gentile are excluded from being any meritorious cause of iustification and consequently all their boasting of their owne forces their first iustification being freely bestowed vpon them s paul speaketh not of deseruing to be made christians but of attaining to saluation as it is apparant by his disputation in the epistle to the romanes rom by the workes of the law no man liuing shall be iustified what is iustified shall be made a christian after your interpretation so afterward rom a man is iustified that is made a christian by faith and not by the workes of the law so haue we a new interpretation of iustification by faith besides it would be remembred that you distinguish between workes of nature and workes of grace denying iustification to them and granting it to these how will this stand with your answere neither doth the apostle dispute how they were to attaine to the grace of christ but how they were to receiue pardon and acceptation to euerlasting life which he truly ascribeth on our part to beleefe in christ by which wee obtaine rom gal both these priuiledges as for meriting of iustification there is not a letter of it in any place of the new or old testament and though there be no meritorious cause of it in workes before grace yet boasting by your doctrine is not excluded for may i not iustly boast that my selfe being inlightened by god spirit and hauing a good motion inspired into me by the power of mine owne free will accepted of the grace of god offered me and so am iustified where my cause of boasting is the greater because many other man who might haue been iustified as well as i haue not imploied their free will so well as i haue done and therfore are damned yet all this notwithstanding a certainevertuous disposition is required in the iew and gentile wherby his soule is prepared to receiue that great grace of iustification that say we is faith feare hope loue and repentance that say the protestant is faith only wherefore say we as the excluding of works and boasting exclude not faith no more do they exclude the rest faith being asvvell our vvorke and a vvorke of the law as any of the rest and all the rest being of grace as well as faith and as farre from boasting of as faith it selfe there is no vertuous disposition required of the one or the other in respect whereof he shall be iustified onely the acknowledgment of sinne and such like are vsed as meanes by god to act amp bring a sinner to beleeue in iesus christ to iustification yet so as that neither these dispositions proceed from the free will of man but from the spirit of god inclining them that god will iustifie to these actions nor any of these but onely beleeuing is respected of god on mans part to his iustification now that out of s luke beleeue only is nothing to the purpose for he was bidde beleeue the raysing of his daughter to life and not that christs righteousnes was his and faith alone may be a sufficient disposition to obt aine a miracle but not to obtaine iustification of which the question on y is that place of luke luke sheweth thus much as also the ordinarie course of the old testament doth that the thing god regardeth and requireth of man to the obtaining of any fauour is resting vpon him for that he stands in neede of fasting praying and such like exercises are meanes to make a man discerne truly of his owne vnworthines and so the rather to trust to god mercie and power but the thing respected by god is resting on him and referring himselfe wholy to his will and pleasure consider now good reader whether of our interpretations agree better with the circumstances of the text and the iudgment of the auncient fathers the texts see thou in the testament take for a taste of the fathers iudgment s augustines exposition of those places of s paul of one of the chiefest of which thus he speaketh man not vnderstanding that vvhich the apostle saith vve esteeme a man to be iustified vvithout the law thought him to say that faith sufficed a man although he liued euill and had no good workes which god forbid that the vessell of election should thinke they that so vnderstand the rom apostle as the gnostickes did vtterly mistake him we are altogether of hypognost lib s austins opinion that faith cannot iustifie him that liues euilly and hath no good workes for as de side amp oper cap he truly saith though they goe not before iustification yet they accompanie it euery iustified man being also sanctified neither is the faith he speaketh of such a faith as we vnderstand because it workes not by loue but such as the diuell hath who saith austin in the same place hath not the faith by which the iust man liues which workes by loue that god may giue him life euerlasting according to his workes and againe therefore the apostle saith that a man is iustified by faith and not of workes because faith is first giuen and by it the rest which are properly called workes and in which we liue iustly are by petition obtained in this place aug de side amp oper cap austin takes iustification for the whole fitting of a christian to a holy conuersation to which iustification indeede is but a foundation the building being finished by sanctification by which it is manifest that s paul excluding the workes of the law and the workes done by our owne only forces doth not meane to exclude good workes which proceed from the helpe of god grace he must of necessitie according to his course of disputing exclude good workes from that iustification hee there speakes of but not from the life of a christian man reason iii very reason may teach thus much mans reason is but a blind mystris in matters of faith and he hat hath no better an instructor in such high misteries must needs know little mans reason is not of it selfe sufficient to determine of truth and falsehood in diuinitie but being inlightened by the spirit of god with the knowledge of faith it may easily see the diverse vse of that from other graces and vertues for no gift in man is apt and fitte as a spirituall hand to receiue and apply christ and his righteousnesse vnto a sinner but faith but what if that also faile you in this point then euery man cannot but see how naked you are of all kind of probabilitie i say then that reason rather teacheth the contrarie for in common sense no man apprehendeth and entreth into the possession of any thing by beleeuing that he hath it for if a man should beleeue that he is rich of honour wise or vertuous doth he thereby become presently such a one nothing lesse his faith and perswasion is no fit instrument to applie and draw these things to himselfe as all the world sees how then doth reason teach me that by beleeuing christs righteousnes to be mine owne i lay hand on it and make it mine againe christs righteousnes according to their owne opinion is not receiued into vs at all but is ours only by god imputation what need we then faith as a spirituall hand to receiue it if they say as m perkins doth that faith is as it were a condition required in vs which when god seeth in vs he presently imputeth christs righteousnesse to vs and maketh it ours then will i be bold to say that any other vertue is as proper as faith to haue christ applied vnto vs there being no other aptnesse requisite in the condition it selfe but only the will and ordinance of god then euery thing that it shall please him to appoint is alike apt and so m perkins had small reason to say that faith was the onely apt instrument to applie to vs christs righteousnes reason perceiuing that the scripture ordinarily ascribeth iustification to beleeuing and maketh beleeuing in christ the receiuing of christ which is not granted to any other of those vertues may well conclude that faith onely is the spirituall hand to take hold of christ and his righteousnes by and not feare loue hope or repentance indeede loue hope the feare of god and repentance haue their seuerall vses in man but none serue for this ende to apprehend christ and his merits none of them all haue this receiuing propertie and therefore there is nothing in man that iustifieth as a cause but faith alone moreouer true diuine reason teacheth me that both hope and charitie do much more applie vnto christians all christs merits and make them ours then faith for what faith assureth me of in generall that hope applieth vnto me in particular by faith i beleeue christ to be the sauiour of all mankind by hope i trust to be made partaker of that saluation in him none of these hath that aptnes that is in faith for the other haue more shew of desert in man but god purposeth to set out his loue to the soule he saueth which can be done by no meanes so well as when the party to be iustified doth nothing but rest vpon god to receiue iustification at his mercifull hands of the difference between faith and hope i haue spoken article part article otherwhere now i say only thus much that to hope without faith is vaine if i beleeue i may not hope alone but be sure i am iustified if i doe not beleeue i may be sure of the contrarie but charitie doth yet giue me a greater confidence of saluation for by the rule of true charity as i dedicate and imploy my life labours and all that i haue to the seruice of god so all that god hath is made mine so farre forth as it can be made mine according vnto that sacred law of friendship amicorum omnia sunt communia and therefore in true reason neither by faith nor any other vertue we take such hold on christs merits nor haue such interest in his inestimable treasures as by charity this were the way indeed to make god debtor to man and man a more speciall cause of his owne iustification than god yes to make man in ex congr o equitie at the least deserue his iustification at god hands but what prince would bee so dealt withall by a traytor especially if he meant to manifest the riches of his mercie in affoording fauour would he trow you haue his traiterous subiect plead an interest to his loue kindnes and bountie by imploying his life and labours to do him seruice and so to receiue all benefits from him rom as a friend from a friend by the law of mutuall good will who seeth not how directly this runnes against the whole course of the new testament which s augustine vnderstood well when he made it the modell and measure of iustification saying that charity beginning was justice beginning charity encreased vvas iustice encreased great charity vvas great iustice and perfect charity was perfect iustice aug de natur amp grat cap vlt austin speakes not of iustification but of walking cheerefully in obedience to god commandements after we are iustified which we cannot doe vnlesse the loue wee beare to god make all difficulty that we shall meet with light and easie to vs in this respect charitie beginning is iustice beginning because he that hath begun to loue hath also begun to walke in the way of righteousnes making light of all hindrances by reason of his loue and as his loue groweth so doth his righteousnes in his whole conuersation reason iv the iudgement of the auncient church ambr on rom they are blessed to whom without any labour or worke done iniquities are remitted and sinne couered no workes or repentance required of them but onely that they beleeue and cap neither working any thing nor requiting the like are they iustified but by faith alone through the gift of god and corinthian this is appointed of god that whosoeuer beleeueth in christ shall be saued without any worke by faith alone freely receiuing remission of sinnes to these and such like words i answere first that it is very vncertaine whether these commentaries be saint ambroses you that could so confidently thrust vpon vs those commentaries on the reuelation for ambroses which were neuer heard of till within these last yeres should not haue made a doubt of these on the romanes that haue been receiued for his so many hundreds of yeeres but i will not striue about the matter once this is out of doubt that they are very ancient and generally held to be true for doctrine orthodoxall secondly that that author excludeth not repentance but only the workes of moses law which the iewes held to be necessary as circumcision and such like see the place and conferre with it that which he hath written in the same worke vpon the fourth to the hebrews where he hath these vvords faith is a great thing and vvithout it it is not possible to be saued but faith alone doth not suffice but it is necessary that faith worke by charitie and conuerse worthie of god not repentance he names it expresly ambros ad rom verse nulla ab his requisita poe niten iae opera no workes or repentance required of them but he meanes not workes of the ceremoniall law onely he meanes both ceremoniall and morall ad verse that law which the gentiles had by nature which if a man keepe he shall liue ad verse abraham had not whereof to boast because he was circumcised or because he abstained from sinne but because he beleeued ad verse to him that worketh that is to him that is subiect to the law of moses or of nature ad verse ob oxius p cca is to him that worketh not that is to him that is guiltie of sinne because he doth not that which the law commaunds ambros ad hebr cap in that place vpon the hebrues he speaketh not of iustification as in the other but of our entring into rest or heauen to which no man shall come that doth not liue holily beautifying as he there speaketh his faith with workes de verbis dom sermon august there is one propitiation for all sinnes to beleeue in christ hesyc on leuit lib cap grace which is of mercie is apprehended by faith alone and not of workes m perkins next authoritie is gathered out of s augustine there is one propitiation for all sinners to beleeue in christ true but where is it that we need nothing else but to beleeue hesychius saith grace vvhich is of mercy is apprehended by faith alone and not of vvorkes that is vve doe not merit by our vvorks done before grace any thing at god hand but of his mercie receiue both faith and iustification this testimonie of austin and the next of hesychius are answered by roate and not by iudgement for they are both misquoted which he must needes haue obserued and then would haue reprooued if he had lookt for them in the places cited the former i cannot finde and therefore let it passe without any answere if hesych in leuit lib cap this interpretation may goe for currant i know not what may be refused as counterfeit grace which is of mercy is apprehended by faith alone and not of workes that is say you wee doe not merit by our workes done before grace any thing at god hand but of his mercie receiue both faith and iustification hesychius saith that grace is apprehended by faith alone you make him say that we receiue both faith and iustification of god mercy he speaketh of attaining to grace by faith you expound him of receiuing faith by god mercie but indeed hesychius in his owne speech maketh a distinction affirming of grace that it is praebetur giuen vs viz on god behalfe of mercie and compassion and is receiued on our part by faith alone and not by workes supra can ferm bernard whoseeuer is pricked for his sinnes and thirsteth after righteousnesse let him beleeue in thee who iustifieth a sinner and beeing iustified by faith alone hee shall haue peace with god bernard hath vvhosoeuer thirsteth after righteousnes let him beleeue in thee that being iustified by faith alone he may haue peace with god ans by faith alone he excludeth all other meanes that either levv or gentile required but not charity which his very words include for how can we abhorre sin and thirst after iustice vvithout charitie and in the same worke he declareth plainely that he comprehendeth alwaies charitie vvhen he speakes of a iustifying faith saying a right faith doth not make a man righteous if it vvorke not by charitie and againe neither workes vvithout faith nor faith without vvorkes is sufficient to make the soule righteous the chiefe thing the iewes stood vpon was charitie which they knew the law especially required and therefore to leaue that in was to aduance the righteousnes of the iewes at the least in their opinion we may abhorre sinne for feare of punishment and thirst for righteoosnes for desire of glorie without any respect of loue but to our selues in bernard in cant ser those places you bring he sheweth what faith hee meaneth euen as we doe who say that no faith can iustifie but that which workes by loue not in the very act of iustifying but in the course of our conuersation therfore bernard in cant ser in the former place when he hath said that being iustified by faith alone we shall haue peace with god he doth afterward distinguish iustification from sanctification they therefore that being iustified by faith desiderant deliberantque ctari desire and resolue to follow after holines ampc and in the latter he saith that faith without workes is dead to seuer loue from faith is to kill it but none of these things prooue that bernard gaue the habit or the act of loue any place of a cause in our iustification or any respect with god to our iustification for then how could hee haue said by faith onely chrysost on gal they said he which resteth on faith alone is cursed but paul sheweth that hee is blessed which resteth on faith alone he speakes of the iewes who held christians accursed because resting on the faith in christ would not obserue withall oses law the apostle contrariwise denounceth them accursed who would ioyne the ceremonies of moses lavv vvith christian religion and so faith alone there excludeth only the old lavv not the vvorkes of charity that chrysost ad gal chrysostom speaketh of the morall law any man may see that markes how he vrgeth the apostles reason to prooue them accursed who will ioyne the law with faith to iustification namely that they are accursed because they cannot fulfill euery part of the morall law for of it is that deut sentence vttered basil de humil let man acknowledge himselfe to want true iustice and that he is iustified onely by faith in christ so he mangleth pittifully a sentence of s basils saying let man acknowledge himselfe to want true iustice and that he is iustified only by faith in christ if a man knovv himselfe iustified by faith in christ hovv can he acknovvledge that he vvants true iustice his vvords truly repeated are these let man acknovvledge that he is vnvvorthy of true iustice and that his iustification comes not of his desert but of the meere mercy of god through christ so that by saith alone s basill treating of humilitie excludes all merit of our ovvne but no necessary good disposition as you may see in his sermon de fide vvhere he proues by many texts of holy scripture that charity is as necessary as faith that is saith basil perfect and full reioycing in god sight when a man is not lifted vp no not for his owne righteousness but acknowledgeth himselfe indeed to be destitute of true righteousnes and to be iustified onely by faith in christ basil in ascet de fide fides est a esus indubitatus ad ea quae a tur basil in that place speaketh of faith as it is an assent to those things that are taught by the grace of god requiring workes not to iustification but in our cariage here to saluation origin on cap rom wee thinke that a man is iustified by faith without the workes of the law and he saith that iustification by faith alone sufficeth so as a man onely beleeuing may be iustified and therefore it lieth vpon vsto search who was iustified by faith without workes and for an example i thinke vpon the theefe who being crucified with christ cried vnto him lord remember me when thou commest into thy kingdome and there is no other good worke of his mentioned in the gospell but for this alone faith iesus saith vnto him this night thou shalt be with me in paradise origin excludeth no good disposition in vs to iustification but saith that a man may besaued vvithout doing ourvvardly any good vvorkes if he vvant time and place as the theefe did vvho presently vpon his conuersion vvas put to death vvhich is good catholike doctrine but that you may perceiue hovv necessary the good dispositions before mentioned be to iustification you shall find if you consider wel al circumstances not one of them to haue bin wanting in that good theefes conuersion first that he stood in feare of god iust iudgment appeares by these his vvords to his fellovv doest thou not feare god ampc he had hope to be saued by christ out of vvhich he said o lord remember me vvhen thou commest into thy kingdome by both vvhich speeches is shevved also his faith both in god that he is the gouernour and iust iudge of the vvorld and in christ that he vvas the redeemer of mankind his repentance and confession of his fault is laid dovvne in this and vve trulie suffer vvorthilie his charity tovvards god and his neighbour in reprehending his fellovves blasphemie in defending christs innocence and in the middest of his greatest disgraces and raging enemy to confesse him to be king of the vvorld to come out of all vvhich vve may gather also that he had a full purpose to amend his life and to haue taken such order for his recouery as it should please christ his sauiour to appoint so that he lacked not any one of those dispositions vvhich the catholike church requires to iustification your discourse of the theeues vertues and good workes doth not refute the truth of master perkins allegation but if it doe any thing condemnes origens iudgement of him as for the dispositions you often mention doubtlesse if origin had thought that any such had been necessarie or respected by god in the iustification of that theefe he would neuer haue said that he was iustified without workes that did so many good workes in so short a time novv that that great doctor origin meant not to exclude any of these good qualites out of the company of faith is apparant by that vvhich he hath vvritten on the next chapter vvhere he saith that faith cannot be imputed to iustice to such as beleeue in christ vnlesse they doe withall put off the old man and a little before more plainely saying i thinke that faith is the first beginning of saluation hope is proceeding in the building but the toppe and perfection of the whole worke is charitie neither doe we meane to exclude such qualities for they come together but are not of like vse nor to the same purpose both the sentences you alleage out of him wee approoue that faith which is without sanctification cannot instifie that faith is not all that is required to saluation but all graces of regeneration are to be laboured for and obtained before wee can come to heauen and by this wee may see that as the fathers so origin also makes a difference between iustification where faith onely is respected and saluation to which all vertues are required the third difference about iustification is concerning this point namely how far forth good workes are required thereto the doctrine of the church of rome is that there be two kinds of iustification the first and second as i haue said the first is when one of an euill man is made a good man and in this workes are wholy excluded it being wholy of grace the second is when a man of a iust man is made more iust and this they will haue to proceede from workes of grace for say they as a man when he is once borne can by eating and drink make himselfe a bigger man though he could not at the first make himselfe a man euen so a sinner hauing his first iustification may afterward by grace make himselfe more iust therefore they hold these two things i that good works are meritorious causes of the second iustification which they tearme actuall ii that good workes are meanes to increase first iustification which they call habituall now let vs see how far forth we must ioyne with them in this point our consent therefore stands in three conclusions i that good workes done by them that are iustified doe please god and are approoued of him and therefore haue a reward ii good workes are necessarie to saluation two waies first not as causes thereof either conseruant adiuvant or procreant but onely as consequents of faith in that they are inseparable companions and fruits of that faith which is indeede necessarie to saluation secondly they are necessarie as markes in a way and as the way it selfe directing vs vnto eternall life iii wee hold and beleeue that the righteous man is in some sort iustified by works for so the holie ghost speaketh plainely and truely iam that abraham was iustified by workes m perkins first graunteth that good vvorkes doe please god and haue a temporall revvard that they are necessary to saluation not as the cause thereof but either as markes in a vvay to direct vs tovvards saluation or as fruites and signes of righteousnesse to declare one to be iust before man all vvhich he shuffleth in rather to delude our arguments then for that they esteeme much of good vvorkes vvhich they hold to be no better then deadly sinnes this is no good dealing to foyst in temporall as if you would haue man suspect that we allow good workes no reward in heauen it had been enough for you to leaue out his words as you doe and thrust in your owne without adding at your pleasure but these are popish shifts whereof you presently affoord vs another example by putting in these words before man to make the world beleeue that we giue no place to good works in the sight of god whereas pag master perkins professeth that abraham was iustified by works euen before god not onely before man as you write to this you adde in the third place a shamelesse slander article part article against your owne knowledge that we hold good workes to be no better than deadly sinnes whereas wee teach that those that are indeed good workes are able to iustifie a man perfectly in the presence of god and to deserue euerlasting life yes we maintaine that the imperfect workes of the regenerate are brought foorth by the grace of god spirit and for all their imperfection are accepted and shall be rewarded by god our father in heauen thus farre we ioyne with them and the very difference is this they say we are iustified by works as by causes thereof wee say that wee are iustified by works as by signes and fruites of our iustification before god and no otherwise and in this sense must the place of s iames be vnderstood that abraham was iustified that is declared and made manifest to bee iust indeede by his obedience and that euen before god now that our doctrine is the truth it will appeare by reasons on both parts the maine difference then betvveene vs consisteth in this vvhether good vvorkes be the true cause indeed of the increase of our righteousnes vvhich vve call the second iustification or vvhether they be onelie fruits signes or markes of it the maine difference as master perkins propounds it is whether we be iustified by works as by causes meritorious of our iustification not whether they bee the true cause of our second iustification which he denies wholy as a deuice of yours and indeede they sander de iustif lib c pag that haue more neerely sifted this branne haue found that there is but one iustification because faith and workes make one righteousnes begun by aith and increased and perfected by workes iustification saith andrad orthod e plic lib pag andradius the great champion of the councill of trent consists of two parts forgiuenes of sinnes and obedience to the law stapleton promptu cathol ad ioa stapleton speakes more plaine the catholikes say that a man is iustified by faith and workes as by the formall cause so that according to your popish diuinitie workes are not onely the meritorious efficient cause of our iustification but the formall cause also as stapleton directly affirmes m perkins pretends to proue that they are no cause of the increase of our iustice and yet frames not one argument directly to that purpose but repeates those obiections and proposeth them now at large which he made before against the first iustification the which although impertinent to this place yet i will solue them first and then set dovvne our owne this pretence is none of his who would neuer denie that our inherent righteousnes is increased though not meritoriously by our holy actions which make vs euery day more and more fit to serue and please god but master perkins vnderstanding your opinion better than your selfe will be knowne to doe frames his reason against this position that workes are part of that righteousnes which we must pleade before god for the deseruing of euerlasting life or that our iustification before god is partly of workes and partly of faith which is the doctrine of your church howsoeuer by you it be blanched i rom we conclude that a man is iustified by faith without the workes of the law some answer that ceremoniall workes bee excluded here some that morall workes some works going before faith but let them deuise what they can for themselues the truth is that paul excludeth all workes whatsoeuer as by the text will appeare for verse hee saith we are iustified freely by his grace that is by the meere gift of god giuing vs to vnderstand that a sinner in his iustification is meerely passiue that is doing nothing on his part whereby god should accept him to life euerlasting ans the apostle there speakes of the iustification of a sinner for he saith before that he hath proued both iew and greeke to be vnder sinne and that all haue sinned and need the glory of god wherefore this place appertaines not vnto the second iustification and excludes only either workes of the law as not necessarie vnto the first iustification of a sinner against the iewes who thought and taught them to be necessary of else against the gentiles any worke of ours from being any meritorious cause of that first iustification for vve acknovvledge ve e willingly as you haue heard often before that euery sinner is iustified freely of the meere grace of god through the merit of christ only and without any merit of the sinner himselfe your answere of the second instification is idle because the distinction as i haue shewed is vaine master perkins prooueth that iustification is wholy of faith because rom the apostle excludeth workes from it whereas you teach that faith and workes together make vp that iustice or righteousnes whereby a man is iustified before god and yet is not a sinner being of yeares of discretion meerely passiue in that his iustification as m perkins very ab urdly saith for in their owne opinion he must beleeue which is an action and in ours not only beleeue but also hope loue and repeet master perkins makes not a sinner meerely passiue in his iustification but in receiuing the gift of faith and in being stirred vp to beleeue and yet is he not in these neither passiue as fondly you imagine we say for he heares and sometimes meditates feares hopes ampc but in this respect he is said to bee passiue because his yeelding to beleeue proceedes not from any strength of his free will vpon the good motion inspired but from the spirit of god inclining him ineuitably to beleeue freely and verse he saith iustification by faith excludeth all boasting and therefore all kind of workes are thereby excluded and speciallie such as are most of all the matter of boasting that is good works for if a sinner after that hee is iustified by the merit of christ were iustified more by his owne workes then might hee haue some matter of boasting in himselfe and this kind of iustification excludeth all boasting in our selues as well as theirs for as they must giant that they may not bragge of their faith although it be an act of theirs so necessa ily required at their iustification that without it they could not be iustified euen so let them thinke of the rest of those good preparations which we hold to be necessarie that we cannot truely bpast of them as though they came of our selues but we confesse all these good inspirations as all other good to descend from the bounteous liberality of the ather of lights and for the yeelding of our consent to them we can no more vaunt then of consenting vnto aith all which is no more then if a man be mired in a lake and vnable of himselfe to get out would be content that another of his goodnesse should helpe him out of it from this ariseth the true difference between you and vs concerning boasting that we haue nothing left vs to brag of because not onely the abilitie but the very act of beleeuing is brought to passe by god spirit in uitably but your many actions of fearing hoping repenting louing beleeuing are caused by your owne free will without any certaintie of euent on god part as a cause thereof yet obserue by the way that s paul forbiddeth not all glorying or boasting for he orieth in the hope of glorie of the son of god and in his tribulations againe he defiueth that vve may glorie in measure and that he might glory in his power and that he vvas constrained to glory in his visions and reuolations so that a good christian may glory in our lord and in his heauenly gifts so it be in measure and due season acknowledging them from whence they come but to boast and say that either god needed vs or that our good parts were cause that god called vs first to his seruice is both false and vtterly unlawful the apostle excludes no boasting but in a mans selfe and all that he must needs shut out if he will reserue god glorie entire to him for he that may truly say that he is beholding to his own free will for his iustification as he may who by the good vse of it at his choise without being certainly inclined thereto by the spirit procured his own iustification hath cause to boast of his owne goodnes not caused by god in respect of the act of beleeuing now he that boasts of the inheritance of heauen which god onely hath prouided for him and fitted him to boasteth not of himselfe rom though in the middest of tribulations he breake out into this boasting but how proou this that therefore all boasting is not forbidden in the matter of iustification to which corinthian the next place alleaged no way belongs being spoken by the apostle of himselfe in respect of those gifts that god had bestowed vpon him for the worke of his ministerie the corinthian last being of the same nature is so farre from prouing the lawfulnes of boasting that the verse apostle is saine to excuse himselfe for it as a thing inexpedient but howsoeuer it can by no meanes prooue that the apostle shuts not all boasting out of iustification and that wee may not doubt of pauls meaning consider and read ephesians by grace saith he you are saued through faith and that not of your selues it is the gift of god not of works least any man should boast himselfe here paul excludes al and euery worke and directly workes of grace themselues as appeares by the reason following for wee are his workemanship created in christ iesus vnto good works which god hath ordained that we should walke in them now let the papists tell me what bee the workes which god hath prepared for man to walke in and to which they are regenerate vnlesse they bee the most excellent workes and let them marke how paul excludes them wholy from the worke of iustification and saluation ephesian is nothing against our doctrine of iustification but too too ignorantly or maliciously cited against it and note also vvith s austin that faith is there mentioned to exclude all merits of our workes which vvent before and might seeme to the simple to haue been some cause vvhy god bestovved his first grace vpon vs but no vertuous dispositions requisite for the better preparation to the same grace what ignorance or malice there is in alleaging this text against your doctrine of iustification it shal appeare by and by in the meane time i answere concerning austin first aug lib qq q that in the place you name there is neuer a word of the sentence in question secondly that his scope in that treatise is no more but to shew that they falsely vnderstood such rom places of the apostle as speake against iustification by workes who thinke that when once they haue beleeued in christ they shall be saued by faith though they liue neuer so wickedly thirdly to refu e that lewd conceit aust addes that the apostle ad hoc potius rather therefore saith that a man is iustified by faith without the works of the law because he would haue no man imagine that he hath obtained iustification by faith vpon the merit of his former workes this we grant to be true but not all that the apostle intendeth for it cannot be doubted but that he confuteth the opinion of the iewes and heathen concerning iustification as it is plaine by the rom amp amp three first chapters now they did not make account to deserue the grace of iustification at god hands by their holy and vertuous liuing but to inherit heauen by it neither could they that did beleeue so much flat themselues as to dreame that their good deeds in particular had procured that fauour when it was easie for them to see that many thousands both iewes and gentiles as good or better than corinthian diverse of themselues for vertuous behauiour notwithstanding attained not to this iustification besides if we mark the reasons by which the rom amp amp apostle beates down their pride they are such as generally concerne all both iewes and gentiles adde hereunto that austin speakes no further for the vse of good works but to shew that they are necessarie for a christian man as vacuam esse side si non bene operetur without which his faith is voide and idle and that no man may dreame that if hee beleeue it non ad eum pertineat bene operari pertaines not to him to worke well which are the words that immediatly goe before these you bring and therefore very fondly doth m perkins inferre that in that sentence s paul speaketh of vvorkes of grace because in the text follovving he mentioned good vvorkes whereas the apostle putteth an euident distinction betvveene those tvvo kinde of vvorks signifying the first to be of ourselues the second o proceede from vs as god vvorkmansh o created in christ iesus and the first he calleth vvorkes simplie the second good vvorkes prepared of god for vs to walke in after our first iustification what grosse ignorance then vvas it to take these tvvo so distinct manner of vvorkes for the same and to ground himself so boldly vpon it master perkins saith that the apostle barres all workes before and after grace he prooues it by the very text it self the reason may be thus more plainly propounded we are not saued by works saith ephesians verse vers the apostle that no man may boast his proofe followeth for good workes are appointed by god for vs to walke in for which purpose he hath made vs anew in iesus christ that this tenth verse is a proofe of the former the coniunction for declares but how it can serue to that purpose if the two verses speake of diverse kindes of works some iustifying some not iustifying neither i see nor i thinke you can shew me what though he call the former workes simply the latter good workes are not the former those workes which the law morall and naturall require and are not they in their nature good workes but who knoweth not that by workes without any addition workes of grace after iustification are signified let the apostle iam iames speake who intreating of such workes and naming them almost in euery verse doth not once call them good workes but workes simply ii gal if ye be circumcised ye are bound to the whole law and ye are abolished from christ here paul disputeth against such man as would be saued partly by christ and partly by the workes of the law hence i reason thus if a man will be iustified by works he is bound to fulfil the whole law according to the rigour thereof that is pauls ground i now assume no man can fulfill the law according to the rigour thereof for the liues and works of most righteous man are imperfect and stained with sinne and therefore they are taught euery day to say on this manner forgiue vs our debts again our knowledge is imperfect and therefore our faith repentance and sanctification is answerable and lastly the regenerate man is partly flesh and partly spirit and therefore his best workes are partly from the flesh and in part onely spirituall thus then for any man to be bound to the rigour of the whole law is as much as if hee were bound to his owne damnation if he can apply the text prefixed vnto any part of the argument erit mihi magnus appollo s paul onely saith in these vvords that if you be circumcised yee are bound to keepe the vvhole lavv of moses m perkins that if a man vvill be iustified by vvorkes he must fulfill the rigour of the lavv which are as iust as germaines lippes as they say but m perkins sayes that it is s paules ground but he is much deceiued for the apostles ground is this that circumcision is as it vvere a profession of iudaisme and therefore he that vvould be circumcided did make himselfe subiect vnto the vvhole lavv of the ievves of the possibilities of fulfilling the lavv because m perkins toucheth so often that string shall be treated in a distinct question as soone as i haue dispatched this master perkins vnderstood his owne minde in this and other arguments better than i can doe and so could haue affoorded better answers for his defence yet thus much i may say that the text of the apostle may be applied to the proposition because they that would be circumcised would be iustified by the workes of the law whereupon it followeth that he that will be iustified by workes is bound to keepe the whole law for so the apostle saith of them that will be iustified by circumcision iii election to saluation is of grace without workes therefore the iustification of a sinner is of grace alone without workes for it is a certaine rule that the cause of a cause is the cause of a thing caused now grace without works is the cause of election which election is the cause of our iustification and therefore grace without workes is the cause of our iustification ans that election is of grace vvithout vvorkes done of our ovvne simple forces or vvithout the vvorks of moses lavv but not vvithout prouision of good vvorkes issuing out of faith and the helpe of god grace as shall be handled more largely in the question of merits this answere is not only against the rom apostle paul and aug epistle austins exposition of him but also contrarie to lombard lib dist lombard thomas q article amp in senten dist q article amp qq disp q de praed article amp ad rom thomas bellarm de gra amp lib arb lib c amp seqq bellarmine and generally the learnedst papists as it shall appeare if this writer giue occasion iv a man must first be fully iustified before he can doe a good worke for the person must first please god before his works can please him but the person of a sinner cannot please god till he bee perfectly iustified and therefore till he bee iustified hee cannot doe so much as one good worke and thus good works cannot be any meritorious causes of iustification after which they are both for time and order of nature in a word whereas they make two distinct iustifications wee acknowledge that there be degrees of sanctification yet so as iustification is onely one standing in remission of sinnes and god acceptation of vs to life euerlasting by christ and this iustification hath no degrees but is perfect at the very first the fourth argument a man must be fully iustified before he can doe a good vvorke and therefore good vvorkes cannot goe before iustification true not before the first iustification of a sinner but good sir you hauing made in the beginning of this last article a distinction betweene the first and second iustification and hauing before discussed the first and the second novv remaining and expecting you vvhy did you not say one vvord of it the matter being ample and vvell vvorthy the handling he that denieth a second iustification and hath disprooued it neede not stand vpon a deuice of yours how worthy the handling soeuer you thinke it albeit you vvill not vvillingly confesse any second iustification as you say yet had it been your partat least to haue disproued such arguments as vve bring to proue a second iustification ye acknovvledge that there be degrees of sanctification but these degrees must be made dovvnevvard of euill vvorser and vvorst for if all our sanctification and best vvorkes be like vnto defiled cloutes and no better then deadly sinnes as you hold else vvhere let any vvise man iudge vvhat degrees of goodnesse can be lodged in it but that you knew none of your side doe vse to reade our bookes nor dare without your licence neither you nor other of your popish complices would for shame write in this sort you haue been often answered that wee acknowledge inherent righteousnesse and labour for and by the grace of god attaine to the increase of it in some measure from day to day againe how absurd is that position that there is but one iustification whereby they take fast hold on christs righteousnes which can neuer after be either lost or increased why then doe you with your brother jounuan maintaine that all man are equally righteous if it so be let him that desireth to see you wel coursed read s hierome s amorose s augustine s gregorie we maintaine that all man are equally righteous in regard of iustification but vnequally in respect of sanctification iouinian is rather one of your brood who hold that a man being iustified is hieron contra iouin wholy without sin euen in god iudgement at least you must needs vphold that a man is as iust and righteous at his first conuersion as at his death how godly a life soeuer he lead against vvhich i vvill put dovvne these reasons follovving first that of the reuelations let him that is iust be yet iustified or as your text hath it he that is righteous let him be more righteous he that is iustified is as righteous at the first as at the last in respect of iustification but not inherent righteousnes or sanctification of which the places you alleage are meant and therefore need no further answere but that you may the rather see our desire to satisfie you i will speake a little of them iustified in revelation that place signifieth to proceede in doing iustly as ribera in apocrypha ribera the iesuite proueth by the opposition in the other part of the sentence let him that hurteth hurt still that is goe forward in your hurting saith he and so let him that hurteth no bodie but giueth euery man his due goe forward in so doing let him that doth good saith glossa interlin your

and the interlin bib interlinear bible too so that there is not so much as the word iustified in some of your owne greeke copies and that feare not to be iustified euen vntill death do conuince that there are more iustifications then one and that a man may increase in iustification and righteousnes vntill death eccl that of ecclesiasticus would haue been spared till you haue proued that booke to

iustification bellarm de iust vbi supra prob corinthian bellarmine to the second whose reasons i will answere otherwhere it is enough for the present that a second iustification cannot be prooued out of these two places which is confirmed vvhere it is said that the path of a iust man proceedeth as the light doth vntill it be perfect day which is by degrees more and more and s paul teacheth the same vvhere he saith to man that giue almes plentifully that god vvill maltiplie their seede and augment the increases of the fruits of their iustice this prou place proueth not that there is a second iustification but either that the light of the righteous continueth or at the most that it increaseth to the end which we denynot and this much lesse where corinthian the apostle exhorteth the corinthians to cheerefulnesse in liberalitie to the poore assuring them that god will make them more able to bring forth such fruites of righteousnesse by multiplying their seede and their store ye shall giue them bread to eate saith caietan ad corinthian caietan and deut seede wherewith to sowe againe and iust or honest gaine whereas the gaine that the wicked make is vniust further s iames doth most effectually proue this increase of righteousnes and the second iustification in these vvords abraham our father was he not iustified by vvorkes offer isaac his son vpon the altar that he speaketh of the second iustification is euident for abraham was iustified before isaac was borne as it is most manifest by the scripture it selfe and by that heroicall act of not sparing his onely and entirely beloued son not his iustification genes rom his iustice vvas much augmented and the apostle himselfe seemeth to haue foreseene all our aduersaries cauillation and to haue so long before preuented them first that common shift of theirs that this worke vvas a signe or the fiuit only of his faith and no companion of it in the matter of iustification is formally confuted for the holy ghost speaking distinctly of both his faith and work and ioyning them both in this act of iustification attributeth the better part of it vnto his vvorke thus seest thou that faith did worke vvith his vvorkes and by the vvorkes the saith vvas consummate and made perfect which he doth after fitly declare by a similitude comparing faith to the body and good vvorkes to the soule vvhich giue life and lustre to faith othervvise faith is of little value and estimation vvith god though there is enough said before for the cleering of iam this place yet perhaps it shal not be amisse to follow him in these seueral poynts that he speaketh not of the same iustification which paul doth it is plaine but not that he meaneth your second iustification whereby the former is made perfit to deserue euerlasting life when we say works are no companions of faith in iustification we do not say they are not present but that they do not iustifie neither speak we of testifying our iustification by workes as the apostle here doth but of that which you call the first iustification to which questionlesse this fact of abraham in your own iudgment did not appertaine but he ioyneth faith and workes together how should they be seuered when there is no holy action performed in any part of our life but proceedeth from faith which suapte natura caietan ibi of it owne nature worketh by loue now faith is not said to be perfited by workes as if it did iustifie a man by them for then had it not iustified abraham till this great worke was wrought but because the act is the proose of the perfection of the vertue wherupon it followeth in the text iam that by this worke the scripture was fulfilled which had testified that abraham was iustified by faith for now it manifestly appeared that the testimony was true abraham making it cleare to all the world that he had true faith indeed that is saith caieton such a faith as non renuentem sed pa atam opera caietan ibi would not refuse but was re die to bring forth good workes and in his opinion this is that which iames saith that we are not iustified by a barren faith but by a faith fruitfull in good workes which s paul also teacheth atlarge among other speeches including this that if he should haue all faith and vvanted charitie he vvere nothing and comparing faith and charity together defineth expresly that charitie is the greater vertue which charity is the fountaine of all good vvorkes and so by this preferring these vvorks of charity before faith he doth stop the other starting hole of the protestant that abraham forsooth vvas iustified before god by only faith but vvas declared iust before man by his vvorkes for if god esteeme more of charity then of our faith a man is more iustified before god by charity then by faith god esteemeth more of charity for the vse of our conuersation amongst man but of faith for our iustification and indeed it is a greater honor to god for a man wholy to renounce himselfe and rest vpon him for iustification then to loue god in hope of such a fauour to be receiued vpon our being so prepared againe in the very place where this noble fact is recorded to shevv how acceptable it was to god himselfe it is said in the person of god now i know that thou louest me and to conuince all obstinate cauilling is it not said that his faith did in this very fact cooperate with his works and that the worke made his faith perfect which coniunction of both of them together doth demonstrate that he speaketh o his iustification before god adding also that he vvas therefore called the friend of god which could not haue been if thereby he had been only declared iust before man and thus doth s augustine reconcile the two places of the apostles s paul and s iames which seeme contrary s paul saying that a man is iustified by faith vvithout vvorkes and s iames that a man is iustified by vvorks and not by faith only that s paul speaketh of works vvhich goe before saith such as vve of our owne forces vvithout the helpe of grace are able to doe and such he saith not to deserue our first iustification but s iames disp teth of workes vvhich sollovv faith and issue out of our soules now garnished vvith grace and such he holdeth vs to be iustified by that is made more and more iust see the place he saith directhe that we are iustified and that this iusuce doth increase whiles it doth proceed and profit this labour might haue bin saued for we grant that abraham by this glorious fact was iustified euen before god that is was knowne to be iustified or to haue true faith as he gen was known to feare god by it not that god was ignorant before either of his faith or feare but because it pleased him by this deed to take as it were speciall notice of them both as man doe that righteousnes is increased by holie actions i shewed before and that therefore we are iustified by them that is more sanctified nothing then is more certaine and cleare then that our iustification may daily be augmented and it seemeth to me that this also be granted in their opinion for they holding faith to be the only instrument of iustification cannot deny but that there are many degrees of faith it is so plainely taught in the word o yee of little faith and then a little after i haue not found so great faith in israell and o lord increase our saith and many such like where many different degrees of faith are mentioned how then can the iustification which depends vpon that faith not be correspondent vnto that diuersity of faith but all one againe m perkins deliuereth plainly that man at the first are not so vvell assured of their saluation as they are aftervvard if then in the certainety of their saluation which is the prime effect of their iustification they put degrees they must perforce allow them in the iustification it selfe degrees of faith we deny not but increase of iustification thereupon except it be in our feeling in which respect it receiueth continuall growth but in it selfe it cannot because god doth rom account faith to vs for righteousnes and forgiue our sinnes not by halues but fully vpon the least measure of true beleeuing psalm iudge me according to my righteousnesse hence they reason thus if dauid bee iudged according to his righteousnesse then may hee be iustified thereby but dauid desires to be iudged according to his righteousnesse and therefore he was iustified thereby answer there be two kinds of righteousnes one of the person the other of the cause or action the righteousnesse of a mans person is whereby it is accepted into the fauour of god into life eternall the righteousnes of the action or cause is when the action or cause is iudged of god to be good and iust now dauid in this psalme speaketh onely of the righteousnesse of the action or innocencie of his cause in that hee was falslie charged to haue sought the kingdome in like manner it is said of phineas psalm that his fact in killing zimri and cosbie was imputed to him for righteousnesse not because it was a satisfaction to the lawe the rigour whereof could not be fulfilled in that one worke but because god accepted of it as a iust worke and as a token of his righteousnes and zeale for god glorie obiect ii the scripture saith in sundrie places that man are blessed which doe good workes psalm blessed is the man that is vpright in heart and walketh in the law of the lord ans the man is blessed that endeauoureth to keepe god commaundements yet is he not blessed simply because he doth so but because he is in christ by whom he doth so and his obedience to the lawe of god is a signe thereof obiect iii when man confesseth his sinnes and humbleth himselfe by prayer and fasting god wrath is pacified and staied therefore prayer and fasting are causes of iustification before god answer indeed man that truly humble themselues by prayer and fasting doe appease the wrath of god yet not properly by these actions but by their faith expressed and testified in them whereby they apprehend that which appeaseth god wrath euen the merites of christ in whom the father is well pleased and for whose sake alone he is well pleased with vs obiect iv sundrie persons in scriptures are commended for perfection as noe and abraham zachary and elizabeth and christ biddeth vs all bee perfect and where there is any perfection of works there also workes may iustifie answer there bee two kinds of perfection perfection in parts and perfection in degrees perfection in parts is when beeing regenerate and hauing the seedes of all necessarie vertues we endeauour accordingly to obey god not in some few but in all and euery part of the law as iosias turned vnto god according to all the law of moses perfection in degree is when a man keepeth euery commandement of god and that according to the very rigor therof in y e highest degree now then whereas we are commaunded to be perfected and haue examples of the same perfection in scripture both commaundements and examples must be vnderstood of perfection in partes and not of perfection in degrees which cannot bee attained vnto in this life though we for our parts must dailie striue to come as neare vnto it as possibly we can obiect v corinthian our momentarie afflictions worke vnto vs a greater measure of glorie now if afflictions worke our saluation then workes also doe the same answer afflictions work saluation not as causes procuring it but as a meanes directing vs thereto and thus alwaies must we esteeme of workes in the matter of our saluation as of a certaine way or a marke therein directing vs to glorie not causing and procuring it as bernard saith they are via regni non causa regnandi the way to the kingdome not the cause of raigning there obiect vi wee are iustified by the same thing whereby we are iudged but we are iudged by our good workes therefore iustified also answer the proposition is false for iudgement is an act of god declaring a man to be iust that is alreadie iust and iustification is an other act of god whereby hee maketh him to bee iust that is by nature vniust and therefore in equitie the last iudgement is to proceed by workes because they are the fittest meanes to make triall of euery mans cause and serue fitly to declare whom god hath iustified in this life obiect vii wicked man are condemned for euill workes therefore righteous man are iustified by good workes answer the reason holdeth not for there is great difference betweene euill and good workes an euill worke is perfectly euill and so deserueth damnation but there is no good worke of any man that is perfectly good and therefore cannot iustifie obiect viii to beleeue in christ is a worke and by it we are iustified and if one worke doe iustifie why may we not be iustified by all the workes of the law answer faith must be considered two waies first as a worke qualitie or vertue secondly as an instrument or an hand reaching out it selfe to receiue christs merit and wee are iustified by faith not as it is a worke vertue or qualitie but as it is an instrument to receiue and apply that thing whereby wee are iustified and therefore it is a figuratiue speech to say we are iustified by faith faith considered by it selfe maketh no man righteous neither doth the action of faith which is to apprehend iustifie but the obiect of faith which is christs obedience apprehended these are the principall reasons commonly vsed which as wee see are of no moment to conclude therefore we hold that workes concurre to iustification and that wee are iustified thereby as by signes and effects not as causes for both the beginning middle and accomplishment of our iustification is onely in christ and hereupon john saith if any man beeing alreadie iustified sinne wee haue an aduocate with the father iesus christ and he is the propitiation for our sinnes and to make our good workes meanes or causes of our iustification is to make euery man a sauiour to himselfe the obiections which m perkins makes for vs in this article doe belong either to the question of merits or of the possibility of fulfilling the law or to the perfection of our iustice and therefore i remitte them to those places and will handle the two latter points before i come to that of m rits you are still the same man shifting off that to which you haue no answere readie if you say any thing to these obiections afterward i will referre the reader to it by a b c master perkins argueth that it is vnpossible first for that paule tooke it for his ground that the law could not be fulfilled admitte it were so i then would answere that he meant that a man helped onely with the knowledge of the law cannot fulfill the law but by the ayde of god grace he might be able to doe it which i gather out of s paule where he saith that that vvhich was impossible to the lavv is made by the grace of christ possible your answere is insufficient for the g apostle speaketh not of any strength to be had by the knowledge of the law which no reasonable man euer lookt for but denieth abilitie to the galathians who would haue ioyned faith and works together to iustification that the rom apostle saith is this that the law which promiseth euerlasting life to them that keepe it could not bestow it vpon vs because wee were vnable to performe the condition but god hath prepared that for vs in sending his son to be a sacrifice for sinne that we might obtaine that which by the righteousnes of the law was to be had if we could haue fulfilled it which notwithstanding they onely attaine to that walke not after the flesh but after the spirit obiect the liues and vvorkes of most righteous man are imperfect and stained vvith sinne they are not iustified by their vvorkes ergo quid of this there shall be a seuerall article all this is but trifling to set down reasons as you list and then to answere to them you are too wise to tie any knots but those you see how to vntie the conclusion you seeke for is therefore they cannot be iustified by their workes obiect our knovvledge is imperfect and therefore our faith repentance and sanctification is answerable i would to god all our works were answerable to our knowledge then would they be much more perfect then they are but this argument is also impertinent and doth rather proue it possible to fulfill the law because it is possible to know all the law then if our workes be answerable to our knowledge we may also fulfill it it asketh better proofe than your word that it is possible to know all the law when psalm dauid confesseth himselfe so short of that knowledge and yet a man may know more than he can doe our consequence is good yours naught obiect a man regenerate is partly flesh and partly spirit and therefore his best vvorkes are partly from the flesh not so if we mortifie the deeds of the flesh by the spirit as the apostle exhorteth but these trifling arguments belong rather vnto the next question if we could mortifie them wholy to which the rom column apostle exhorteth they should not be at all of the flesh but since that in this life is impossible all our workes sauour of the flesh i will helpe m perkins to some better that the matter may be more throughly examined why goe yee about to put a yoke vpon the disciples neckes vvhich neither vve nor our fathers vvere able to beare these words were spoken of the law of moses therefore we were not able to fulfill it i answere first that that law could not be fulfilled by the onely helpe of the same law without the further ayde of god grace secondly that it was so burdensome and comberous by reason of the multitude of their sacrifices sacraments and ceremonies that it could hardly be kept with the helpe of ordinary grace and in that sense it is said to be such a yoke as we were not able to beare because things very hard to be done are now and then called impossible let vs see your arguments in comparison whereof master perkins are trifles belike in your iudgement a little helpe would haue serued but it stands you vpon to shew that wee receiue as much in this life as is sufficient for that purpose of all parts of the law the sacrifices sacraments and ceremonies had least need of grace to the keeping of them and therfore that is not the reason why it was a burthen but this is spoken also of the morall law to gal the keeping whereof circumcision bindes by such a distinction any slight thing may to some man be impossible now that josue dauid josiah zachary elizabeth and many others did fulfill all the law is recorded in holy scripture wherefore it is most manifest that it might be kept they fulfilled the law as in his ansvvere to the obiection master perkins hath truly answered you in respect of their sincere endeuour not in some but in all knowne points of god commandements yet faild they in some now and then that commendation of ios iosua is onely in that point of rooting out the heathen wherein he also faulted not a little ios by making peace with the gibeonits before he had asked counsell of god how sam amp amp often and grieuously dauid sinned i had rather haue the scripture speake than my selfe out of it chro iosiah is reprooued for fighting against pharao necho and chasticed for it with losse both of victorie and life luke rom zachary is conuicted of sinne and striken with dumnes for not beleeuing the angell and yet in all probabilitie he was as holie as his wife elizabeth both truly but not perfectly righteous to vvill is in mee but i finde not hovv to performe if saint paul could not performe that which he would how can others ans he speakes there of auoyding all euill motions and temptations which he would willingly haue done but he could not marry he could wel by the assistance of god grace subdue those prouocations to sinne and make them occasions of vertue and consequently keepe all the commandements not suffering those passions to leade him to the breach of any one of them those very motions were no other than sinnes arising from his naturall corruption and preuailing with him so farre rom that they ouercame him sometimes and led him captiue the like answere we make vnto that obiection that one of the ten commandements forbids vs to couet our neighbours goods his wife or servant which as they say is impossible but we hold that it may be well done vnderstanding the commaundement rightly which prohibiteth not to haue euill motions of couetousnes and lecherie but to yeeld our consent vnto them now it is so possible for a man by god grace to refraine his consent from such wicked temptations that s augustine thinketh it may be done of a mortified vertuous man euen when he is a sleepe and restifieth of himselfe that waking he performed it if this be the meaning of it what is it but a needlesse repetition of that which was before forbidden for who knoweth not math that consent to those sinnes was condemned in the and commandements besides the apostle might know by nature that consent to lust was sinne but the true meaning of the commandement rom he knew not but by the law so that withholding consent from these motions is not enough to free vs from sinning by them and yet perhaps that would not seeme so easie if wee did not flat our selues now and then the quotation out of austin is false and being of no great moment i passe it ouer vve doe all offend in many things and if vve say vve haue no sinne we deceiue our selues but if we could obserue all the law we should offend in nothing nor haue any sinne ergo ans i graunt that we offend in many things not because it is not possible to keepe them but for that we are fraile and easily ledde by the craft of the diuell into many offences which we might auoide if vve were so warie and watchfull as we ought to be againe although we cannot keepe our selues from veniall offences yet may we fulfill the lavv which is not transgressed and broken vnlesse we committe some mortall sinnes for veniall sinnes either for the smalnesse of the matter or want of consideration are not so opposite to the law as that they violate the reason and purport of it although they be somewhat disagreeing vvith it but of this matter more fully in some other place it is an idle speculation to imagine a christian as cicero doth an orator and castiglio a courtier and what else is he whom in this answere you fancie such an one since the fall of adam neuer was not in this world euer shall be doe you not see your selfe what pitifull shifts these be veniall sinnes disagree with the law but they do not violate the purport and reason of it are they not against the purenes of god image in which we were created are they not in a naturall man damnable our obedience is to be squared according to the commandement of god neither haue we any warrant from him to excuse our selues by the conceited reason and i know not what purport of the law for my part though i acknowledge a great difference in degrees of sinnes yet i see little reason why it should not be as mortall a sinne to be led away by carelesnes to the committing of those things which we might easily auoide as after a long and tedious fight to be led captiue by the violence of some mightie temptation for this striuing argueth a desire to please and serue god but that needlesse sinning shewes either presumption or want of ordinarie regard lastly it may be obiected that the way to heauen is straite and the gate narrow which is so true that it seemeth impossible to be kept by flesh and blood but that which is impossible to man of themselues is made possible and easie too by the grace of god not euery thing for there are many impossible to man that are neuer made possible and easie by the grace of god so farre as it pleaseth god to make things possible so farre they are made possible but this possibilitie is not communicated to any the examples of the most righteous doe make it more than manifest which made s paul to say i can doe all things in him that strengtheneth and comforteth me he that confesseth he rom cannot doe that good he would sheweth plainly that hilip god doth not enable him to all things which in this place are to be restrained according to the text i can doe all things that is saith lyra ad philipp your glosse i can vse all fortunes and estates well so doe theodoret amp oecumenius ad hunc locum theodoret and oecumenius take it so doe lombard thomas caietan psalm other of your interpreters restraine it shewing that he meaneth not he can do all things but that he could not doe all those things that is be content with any estate were it not for the strength and comfort hee hath from christ and the prophet dauid after thou o lord hadest dilated my hart and with thy grace let it at liberty i did runne the wa es of thy commaundements that is i did readily and willingly performe them of the louing of god with all our hart ampc shall be treated in the question of the perfection of iustice the prophet dauid ranne indeed and that an excellent race but not without stumbling staying and turning a little out of the way now and then as sam you ouervveened your strength as your answeres shew rom the last action in his health declareth hauing now confuted all that is commonly proposed to proue the impossibility of keeping god commandements let vs now see what we can say in proofe of the possibility of it first s paul is very plaine for it saying that which vvas impossible to the lavv in that it is weakned by the flesh god sending his son in the similitude of flesh of sinne damned sinne in the flesh that the iustification of the lavv might be fulfilled in vs vvho vvalke not according to the flesh but according vnto the spirit see how formally he teacheth that christ dying to redeeme vs from sinne purchased vs grace to fulfill the law which before was impossible vnto our weake flesh i shewed the true meaning of rom the place before that god by his son hath iustified vs which the law could not doe because we were vnable to keepe it now the end of this iustification is that wee should walke after the spirit whereby we fulfill the law though not perfectly yet performing the same duties the law requires but not in the same measure againe how farre s john was from that opinion of thinking god commandements to be impossible may appeare by that epistle and his commandements be not heauy which is take out of our sauiours own words my yoke is sweet and my burthen is light the reason of this is that although to our corrupt frailtie they be very heauy yet when the vertue of charity is powred into our harts by the holy ghost then loe doe we with delight fulfill them for as the apostle witnesseth charitie is the fulnes of the lavv and he that doth loue his neighbour hath fulfilled the lavv which christ himselfe teacheth when he affirmeth that the vvhole lavv and prophets depend vpon these tvvo commandements of louing god and our neighbour now both according vnto our opinion and the protestant a man regenerate and in the state of grace hath in him the vertue of charitie we hold it to be the principall part of inherent iustice they say that their iustifying faith can neuer be seperated from it so that a righteous man being also indued with charity is able thereby to fulfill the whole law you haue giuen the true meaning of ioh s john for therefore are god commandements said not to be heauie because our loue to god who hath giuen vs the assurance of his loue to vs in iesus christ maketh vs goe willingly and cheerefully about them for all those incumbrances wee finde by the world the flesh and the diuell and in that respect we are said to fulfill the rom law by charitie because the obedience we performe weake and slender though it be proceedeth from the loue of god and of our neighbour which is the very summe of the law math vpon which both the law and the prophets depend and all this prooueth not perfect but onely true obedience which all that are iustified performe howsoeuer they faile much in the particulars of that measure the law exacteth let vs adioyne vnto these authorities of holy write the testimony of one auncient father or two s basil affirmeth that it is impious and vngodly to say that the commandements of the spirit be vnpossible s augustine defineth that vve must beleeue firmely that god being iust and good could not command things that be impossible for vs to fulfill the reason may be that it is the part of a tyrant amp no true law maker to commaund his subiects to doe that vnder paine of death which he knowes them no way able to performe for those were not to be called lawes which are to direct man to that which is iust but snares to catch the most diligent in and to binde them vp to most assured perdition the sayings of the fathers are to be vnderstood according to the scriptures of possibilitie to performe true obedience which without grace no man can doe not of perfect keeping the law which yet by our creation wee were sufficiently enabled to performe so that god not onely may not but reasonably cannot be suspected of iniustice if hee require that at our hands which he made vs able to doe as with austin we confesse he did basil speaketh not of our abilitie to keepe the commandements but onely sheweth that the charge of looking to our selues belongeth to the contemplation of the minde not to the eyes of the bodie because if it did it were giuen in vaine no man being able to see the hinder parts of his bodie nor his face nor his inwards therefore the holie ghost who doth not command things vtterly impossible will haue this precept of looking to our selues to be vnderstood of the searching of our heart not of the viewing of our bodie wherefore it was afterward decreed in an approued councell of arausican as an article of faith in these words this also vve beleeue according to the catholike faith that all man baptized by grace there receiued vvith the helpe and cooperation of christ both can and ought to keepe and fulfill those things vvhich belong to saluation the principall whereof are after our sauiours owne determination to keepe the commandements if thou wilt enter into life keepe the commandements he may doe them without doubt as i haue often said truly and acceptably to god yet not so fully as he ought because our corruption will not suffer vs to si fideliter laborare voluerint labour faithfully without intermission or infirmitie which the councill requireth and you aduisedly leaue out math that speech of our sauiour is not the voyce of the gospell though that also requires obedience and allowes a reward for it but of the law fit to be vttered to him that came to our sauiour full fraught with the conceit of his owne righteousnes not so much with a desire to learne of him saith hieron apud thomam in catena ad math hierome as to trie his skill and this our sauiour spake of the iustification which is of the law without faith as it appeareth by beda lyra glossa ordinaria rem gius ibi beda lyra the ordinarie glosse and remigius now that iust mens workes be not sinnes which i proue first by some workes of that patterne of patience iob of whom it is written that notwithstanding all the diuels power and craft in tempting of him he continued still a single harted and an vpright man departing from euill and preseruing his innocence if he continued an innocent he sinned not againe if in all these instigations to impatience he remained patient these his workes were perfect for s iames saith esteeme it my brother all ioy vvhen you shall fall into diverse temptations knovving that the probation of your faith vvorketh patience and let patience haue a perfect vvorke that you may be perfect and entire fayling in nothing this as the last point is a matter belike that this man thinkes himselfe well prepared for and therefore he runnes a course of his own in them hauing no such occasion giuen him by master perkins yet let vs follow him step by step by iobs innocencie continued nothing else is meant but that he had not as satan had affirmed he would vttered any blasphemie against god but by this it cannot be prooued that there was no taint of sinne in his patience as for his sinceritie and vprightnes they are vertues that alwaies accompanie true christians and without which all is hypocrisie that perfection or perfect worke is the proouing that his faith is perfect because it ouercommeth as your glossa ordin amp lyra ad lac glosse expounds it and he is counted a perfect man but not simply without any spot in this patience king dauid thus by the inspiration of the holy ghost speaketh of himselfe thou hast o lord prooued my heart thou hast visited me in the night thou hast tried me in fire and there vvas no iniquity found in me it must needs then be granted that some of his workes at least were free from all sinnes and iniquitie and that the most of them were such if you heare the holy ghost testifying it i hope you vvill beleeue it read then vvhere it is of record that dauid did that vvhich vvas right in the sight of our lord and not only in the sight of man and turned from nothing that he commaunded him all the daies of his life except only the matter of vrias the hethite dauid in that place doth not cleare himselfe of all sinne but only protesteth his innocence in respect of any hurt intended by him against saul and the rest of his persecutors dauid meaneth not saith lyra ad psalm lyra to say that he is free from all sin but that he had committed no euill against saul for which he should persecute him it was one thing for dauids workes to be righteous in god sight an other thing for them to be perfect the former we graunt the later you can no way proue that commendation the regina holy ghost giues to his works must needs be spoken in comparison as lyra ibi lyra affirmeth because it is certaine he sam wronged mephthosheth and sam numbred the people but these sins were not comparable to that against vr ah especially for the dishonouring of god by it in the account of the heathen this deed saith sam nathan hath caused the enemy of the lord to blaspheme the apostle affirmeth that some man doe build vpon the only foundation christ iesus gold siluer and pretious stones that is being choyce members of christs catholike church doe many perfect good vvorks such as being tr d in the fornace of god iudgement vvill suffer no losse or detriment as he there saith expresly wherfore they must needs be pure and free from all drosse of sinne othervvise hauing been so proued in fire it vvould haue been found out the apostle doth not say so but this onely that if corinthian any man build on this foundation gold siluer precious stones timber hay or stubble euery mans worke shall be made manifest but put case he had said so he speaketh of doctrine built vpon the true foundation as the whole allegory proues especially verse as a skilfull master builder i haue laid the foundation and an other builds vpon it now in good works one man layeth not the foundation and another buildeth vpon it but euery man begins and ends his owne worke himselfe farther verse the ministers are said to be god labourers the people not euery mans worke god husbandrie and god building because he builds them vp by their labour this place is applied by you papists to proue purgatory euen by bellarm d purgat bellarmine himself but with what successe let any man iudge that either reads our answeres to him or considers the text many vvorkes of righteous man please god make your body a quicke sacrifice holy and acceptable to god the same offer spirituall sacrifices acceptable to god and s paul calleth almes bestovved on him in prison an acceptable sacrifice of svveet sauour and pleasing god but nothing infected vvith sinne all vvhich he hateth deadly can please god and be acceptable in his fight god of his mercy through christ doth pardon sinne or as the protestant speake not impure it to the person but to say that a sinful vvorke is of svveet sauour before him and a gratefull sacrifice to him vvere blasphemie vvherefore vve must needs confesse that such vvorks vvich so vvell pleased him vvere not defiled vvith any kind of sinne your reason is thus framed no workes infected with sinne please god many workes of righteous man please god therefore many workes of righteous man are not infected with sinne i graunt your assumption though the proofe of it rom by the first testimony is insufficient for it doth not follow that we can do this or that because we are exhorted to the doing of it your proposition i deny no sin can please god nor any action as it is sinfull but god both can and doth pardon the faultines of his childrens workes and accept the worke it selfe in christ yes and reward it too with increase of glorie finally many vvorkes in holy vvrite be called good as that they may see your good works to be rich in good vvorks vve are created in christ iesus to good vvorkes but they could not truly be called good vvorkes if they vvere infected vvith sin for according to the iudgement of all learned diuines it can be no good vvorke that fayleth either in substance or circumstance that hath any one fault in it for bonum ex integra causa malum ex quolibet defectu wherefore vve must either say that the holy ghost calleth euill good vvhich vvere blasphemy or else acknovvledge that there be many good vvorkes free from all infection of sinne no workes infected with sinne can be truly called good many workes are called good in scripture therefore many workes are not infected with sinne here is the same fault againe your assumption is true but your proofe naught for the places you alleage proue no more but that the works which we should do are good not that they are good as we doe them your proposition is false as the other was for the works enioyned by god are very good but they haue some allay and abasement by our doing of them which argueth not that they are not truely but that they are not perfectly good in lieu of the manifold testimonies of antiquitie which doth nothing more then recommend good workes and paint out the excellency of them i will set downe one passage of s augustine wherein this verie controuersie is distinctly declared and determined thus he beginneth the iustice through vvhich the iust man liueth by faith because it is giuen to man by the spirit of grace is true iustice the vvhich although it be vvorthilie called in some man perfect according to the capacity of this life yet it is but small in comparison of that greater vvhich man made equall to angels shall receiue vvhich heauenly iustice he that had not as yet saide himselfe to be perfect in regard of that iustice that vvas in him and also imperfect if it be compared to that vvhich he vvanted but certainely this less iustice or righteousnes breedeth and bringeth forth merits and that greater is the revvard thereof vvherefore he that pursueth not this shall not obtaine that hitherto s augustine note first that he defineth the iustice which we haue in this life to be true iustice which is pure from all iniustice and iniquitie then that it is also perfect not fayling in any dutie which we be bound to performe lastly that it bringeth forth good workes such as merit life euerlasting true it is also that this iustice although perfect in it self so farre as mans capacity in this life doth permit yet being compared vnto the state of iustice which is in heauen it may be called imperfect not that this is not sufficient to defend vs from all formall transgression of god law but because it keepeth not vs sometimes from veniall sinne and hath not such a high degree of perfection as that hath you may wel think we make no small account of works that make them the way to heauen that require them as necessary of euery man that looketh to be saued that allow them no small reward in heauen that ground part of our assurance of saluation vpon them first giue me leaue to obserue by the way that the life aug cont epistle pelag lib c austin heare speaketh of is not iustification but holines of conuersation then to your first note the righteousnesse we haue in this life is true righteousnes in regard of the author thereof the spirit of god who cannot deceiue nor be deceiued it is also called perfect in some man not as you say without austins authoritie because it faileth not in any dutie which we are bound to performe but in comparison of the imperfection of it in other man and the vncapablenes that by our corruption is in euery one of vs by merits he meaneth good workes as your selfe also expound them and as the manner of speech that the auncient church vsed requireth the reason whereof is not because they deserue euerlasting life augustine hath no such word but because they shall haue a reward though not vpon desert but fauour it cannot be called imperfect because it doth not keepe vs from sinning if it be true that it is sufficient to keepe vs from all formall transgression of god law else we must say that adams righteousnes was imperfect yes it may well be held that the angels now and we hereafter in heauen shall be kept from sinning not by any strength of inherent righteousnes but by the speciall grace of god continually vpholding vs that it may be proper to god that possiblie he cannot sinne by reason of goodnesse resting in him that i may so speake which cannot be lesse then infinite and sure it is to me somewhat strange that this perfection of righteousnes should be able to keepe vs free from deadly sinnes as you call them and not much more easily preserue vs from veniall saint augustine hath the like discourse vvhere he saith directly that it appertaines to the less iustice of this life not to sinne so that vve haue out of this oracle of antiquitie that many works of a iust man are without sinne the other place of aug de spirit amp litera cap vlt austin rather maketh against you for if it belong to this lesse righteousnes not to sin and for al that measure of it we haue we are not kept from sinning it may seeme that this righteousnes is not perfect so haue you nothing out of this register of antiquity to proue that any workes of a iust man are without sinne to these reasons taken partly out of the scriptures and partly out of the record of antiquitie let vs ioyne one or tvvo dravvne from the absurdity of our aduersaries doctrine vvhich teacheth euery good vvorke of the righteous man to be infected vvith mortall sinne which being granted it vvould follovv necessarily that no good vvorke in the vvorld vvere to be done vnder paine of damnation thus no mortall sinne is to be done vnder paine of damnation for the vvages of sinne is death but all good vvorkes are stained vvith mortall sinne ergo no good vvorke is to be done vnder paine of damnation your syllogisme is naught because it hath foure termes as they are called your assumption not being taken out of your proposition nor your conclusion sutable to the premisses it should be thus framed see article par article no mortall sin is to be done vnder paine of damnation but all good workes are mortall sinnes therefore no good workes are to be dono vnder paine of damnation now the syllogisme is true but the assumption euidently false you chose craftily rather no make a false syllogisme which you thought euery one could not spie then a false assumption manifest to the eyes of the simplest if you should alter the proposition that would be as apparantly false as the assumption is nothing stained with mortall sin is to be done vnder paine of damnation it follovveth secondly that euery man is bound to sinne deadly for al man are bound to performe the duties of the first amp second table but euery performance of any dutie is necessarily linked vvith some mortall sin therefore euery man is bound to commit many mortall sinnes and consequently to be damned these are holy and comfortable conclusions yet inseperable companions if not svvorne brother of the protestant doctrine novv let vs heare vvhat arguments they bring against this catholike verity your other reason is thus to be framed he that is bound to performe the duties of the first and second table is bound to commit many mortall sinnes but euery man is bound to performe all such duties therefore euery man is bound to commit many mortall sinnes the proposition is thus proued according to your collection if the performance of such duties be neerely linked with mortall sinne then he that is bound to performe such duties is bound to commit many mortall sinnes but the performance of such duties as the protestant say is neerely linckt with mortall sinne therfore he that is bound to performe such duties is bound to commit many mortall sinnes i deny the consequence of your proposition this onely followeth vpon the antecedent that he which is bound to performe such duties is bound to performe that which is neerely linckt with some mortall sinne and this we grant to be true we are bound to the performance of those duties in the doing whereof by our corruption there will be some sinne annexed which in it owne nature is deadly first they alleadge these vvords enter not o lord into iudgment with thy servant because no liuing creature shall be iustified in thy sight if none can be iustified before god it seemes that none of their vvorkes are iust in his sight ans there are tvvo common expositions of this place among the auncient fathers both true but farre from the protestant purpose the commonnesse of an exposition is a presumption but not a proofe of the truth thereof for all these two there may be a third of more certainty the former is s augustines s hieromes s gregories in his commentaries vpon that place who say that no creature ordinarily liueth without many veniall sinnes for the which in iustice they may be punished sharpely either in this life or else afterward in purgatory wherfore the best man do very prouidently pray vnto god not to deale with them according vnto their deserts for if he should so doe they cannot be iustified and cleared from many veniall faults and therefore they must all craue pardon for these faults or else endure god iudgements for them before they can attaine vnto the reward of their good deeds aug de perfect iustitiae austin hath not a word in that place of any veniall sinne but deliuereth the latter exposition of comparison with god righteousnes iudge me not saith austin according to thee who article without sinne and that which shall be in the world to come that which he saith shall not be iustified he referres to that perfection of righteousnes which is not in this life neither saith hieron epistle ad ctesip ierome any such thing but speaketh absolutely of all sinne as the other places alledged by him to the same purpose manifestly shew gal god hath shut vp all vnder sinne rom all haue sinned regina if they sin against thee for there is no man that sinneth not ampc neither doth gregor ad psalm gregory make that interpretation vnlesse we shall say that there are no sinnes in the heart but veniall many saith he though delinquunt in opere they sinne not in deed yet slip now and then by vaine and peruerse thoughts after he concludes thus therefore he shall not be iustified in god sight that corde delinquit sinnes in heart vpon which god looketh where he vseth not the word l slipping but sinning as before of the deed therfore this first exposition hath not so much as any one authoritie truly alleaged to countenance it selfe withall the second exposition is more ordinarie with all the best writers vpon the psalmes as s hilary s hierome s arnobius s and others which is also s augustine s gregorie all these say that mans iustice in comparison of the iustice of god will seeme to be no iusti e at all and so take these words no creature neither man nor angell shall be iustified in thy sight that is if his iustice appeare before thine and be compared to it for as the starres be bright in themselues and s ne also goodly in a cleare ight yet in the presence of the glitt sun beames they appeare not at all euen so mans iustice although considered by it selfe it be great and perfect in his kind yet set in the sight and presence of god iustice it vanisheth away and is not to be seene this exposition is taken out of job where he saith i kno it is euen so that no man compared to god shall be iustified take the words of the psalme in whether sense you list that either we haue many ve all faults for which we cannot be iustified in god sight or else that in the sight of god most bright iustice ours will not appeare at all and it cannot be thereof iustly concluded that euery worke of the righteous man is stained with sin and consequently the place is not to purpose let vs see the other exposition and first what hilar ad psalm hilarie saith for it who indeede applieth it to a comparison with god iustice but not onely in degree of righteousnes for he reciteth there diverse passions of anger griefe lust ignorance ampc which are the cause why we cannot be iustified era s in censur erasmus hath brought good reasons to prooue that commentarie on the psalmes to be none of hieromes i will adde one which i thinke may put the matter out of question that hierome refuteth that interpretation which this papist would confirme by that place they hieron plstola ad ctesiph contra pelagian saith hierome delude this testimonie none liuing shall be iustified in thy sight vnder a shew of godlinesse by a new kinde of reasoning for they say that none is perfect in comparison of god as if the scripture had said thus here is your exposition denied to be the meaning of this scripture what is then the meaning when he saith in thy sight he will haue this vnderstood hieron vbi supra saith hierome that euen those which to man seeme holy scientiae amp notitiae dei in god knowledge and approbation are not holy for man looks vpon the face but god lookes into the heart now if no man be righteous when he lookes into and considers the heart whom the secrets of the heart doe not deceiue it is manifestly shewed that the heretikes doe not extoll man on high but derogate from the power of god hierome then is so farre from bringing that interpretation for his owne that he reiects and refutes it and that which is worth the obseruing euen in hieron epistola ad cresiph that place which this papist alleaged for his former exposition it is no marueile if these man can prooue any thing by the fathers arnobius indeed doth so interpret it but if wee rest vpon authoritie his bare exposition is not to ouerweigh hieroms reason besides he is farre from thinking a man righteous in such perfection as you dreame of as it is plaine by his former words who dares say to god saith arnobius ad psalm arnobius heare me in thy truth and in thy righteousnes for it is true and iust that he which hath sinned should be acerrim most sharply punished vpon the beginning of the second verse he hath these words it is thy righteousnes that being lord thou shouldest contemnas think skorne to enter into iudgement with thy servant euthym ad psalm euthymius denieth that a man can be iustified if he be examined according to god summam iustitiam perfect iustice but he addes further or if we consider the benefits of god or his commandements so that the righteous breake euen the commandements of god and are vnrighteous it is a needlesse matter to heape vp authorities for the proofe of that whereof there is no question who doubts that both man and angels in comparison of god infinite perfection are imperfectly righteous and this is all aug contra priscil amp origin austin saith but how can this prooue that the psalme is to be vnderstood of mans righteousnes compared with god this is to deceiue your reader with bare names of man not to perswade him by the consent of the ancient neither doe you remember that aug ad psalm austin where purposely he expounds that psalme giues no such interpretation of it but makes in his sight to be as it is indeed in his iudgement euery liuing man saith austin may perhaps iustifie himselfe co am se non co am te before himselfe but not before thee and afterward quantumlibet ec us how vpright soeuer i seeme to my selfe thou bringest a rule out of thy treasurie thou laiest me to it and i am found prauus euill so that austin vnderstands this place wholy as we doe greg moral lib cap gregory is as truly alleaged as austin and as himselfe was before for he doth not so much as allude to the psalm but onely say according to that text of iob iob which he there expounds that man compared to god cannot be counted righteous that place of iob hath the doctrine which you would wring out of the psalme but where is the proofe that because it is there therfore also it is here but let me also shew that this which you rest vpon cannot bee the meaning of psalm the psalme which i take to be plaine because if we vnderstand it so it is no reason to moue god not to enter into iudgement for what though no man bee so righteous as god if he be so rigeteous as god requires such a creature should be it can neuer hurt him though god enter into iudgement with him a thousand times so the sentence should be vaine there being no occasion of it now the conclusion wee make out of these and such like places is that no man should fancie to himselfe a possibilitie of keeping god commandements when the holiest man that euer were dare not stand before god iudgement seate to giue account of those things they haue done since they were iustified and as the papists say receiued this grace one other ordinary hackney of theirs is that out of the prophet all our righteousnes is as a menstruous or defiled cloath the which i haue already ridde to death in the beginning of the question of iustification whereit was alleadged the answere is briefly that the prophet praying for the sinnes of the people speaketh in the person of the sinfull such as the common sort of them were who had more sins then good workes and so their righteousnesse was like vnto a spotted and stained cloath now this disproueth not but that their good workes although but few yet were free for all sportes of iniquity it only proueth that with their few good they had a great number of euill which defiled their righteousnes and made it like a stained cloath i will let passe your lewd allegorie and your coleworts twice sod referring the reader to my former answere only this i will adde that the prophet may well bee thought to refuse your exposition because he speakes in the plurall omnes iustitiae nostrae all our righteousnesses or rather to make english of it all our good deedes there is not a man who doth not sinne and blessed is the man whose sinnes be not imputed to him and such like i answere that the best man sinne venially and are happy when those their sinnes be pardoned but all this is cleane besides this question where it is only enquired vvhether the good workes that the iust doe be free from sinne and not whether they at other times doe sin at the least venially this is all vvhich m perkins here and there obiecteth against this matter neither the former nor the latter can reasonably be applied to veniall sinne that being regina salomons in his prayer at the dedication of the temple praying for the people in regard of such sinnes as should prouoke god to deliuer them into their enemy hands the other psalm dauids after those great sinnes of murther and adulterie of that idle distinction of veniall sinne it is needlesse to say any thing till it be better prooued but because some others doe alleadge also some darke places out of the fathers i thinke it not amisse to solue them here together s cyprian saith that the be eiged mind of man can hardly resist all assaults of the enemie for when couetousnes is ouerthrowen vp starts lechery and so forth ans all this is true that the life of man is a perpetuall warfare yet man assisted with the grace of god may performe it most valiantly and neuer take any mortall wound of the enemy although through his vvne tie he may be sometimes foyled s h affirmeth that then vve are iust vvhen vve confesse our selues to be sinners ans that all iust man confesse themselues to sinne venially but neither of these places come neare the point in question that not one good deede of the iust man is without some spot or staine of sinne s augustine hath these wordes most perfect charitie which cannot be increased is to be sound in no man in this life and as long as it may bee increased that hich is lesse then it ought to be is faultie of which fault it proceedeth that there is no man vvho doth good and doth not sinne all this we graunt to be true that no man hath so perfect charitie in this life but that sometimes he doth lesse then he ought to doe and consequently doth notso well but that now and then he sinneth at the least veniall and that therefore the said holy doctor had iust cause to say v oe be to the laudable life of a man if it be examined without mercie all which notwithstanding iust man may out of that charity which they haue in this life doe many good workes which are pure from all sinne as hath beene prooued they alleadge yet another plase out of s augustine that belongeth vnto the perfection of a iust man to know in truth his imperfection and in humility to confesse it true that is as he teacheth else where first that the perfection of this life is imperfection being compared with the perfection of the life to come againe that the most perfect in this life hath many imperfections both of wit and will and thereby many light faultes novv come vve vnto s gregory our blessed apostle out of vvhose svveete vvords ill vnderstood they seeme to haue sucked this their poison he saith the holy man iob because hee did see all the merit of our vertue to bee vice if it bee straightly examined of the invvard iudge doth rightly adde if i vvill contend vvith him j cannot ansvvere him one for a thousand i ansvvere that by our vertue in that place is to be vnderstood that vertue vvhich vve haue of our ovvn strength vvithout the aide of god grace vvhich vve acknovvledge to bee commonly infected vvith some vice that s gregorie so tooke it appeares by the vvordes both going before and follovving before he vvriteth thus a man not compared to god receiued iustice but compared vnto him he leeseth it for vvhosoeuer compareth himselfe vnto the author of all good leeseth that good vvhich he had receiued for be that doth attribute the good vnto himselfe doth fight against god vvith his evvne gifts and after thus o contend vvith god is not to giue to god the glorie of his vertue but to take it to himselfe and so all the merit of this our vertue vvhich commeth not of god but is att buted vnto our selfe as proceeding onely from our selues is the very vice of pride and cannot be preiudiciall vnto true good vvorks all vvhich vve acknovvled e to proceede principally from the grace of god dvvelling in vs he saith ther vvith s augustine that in this life vve cannot attaine vnto puritie such as shall be in heauen read the beg ing of his first and second booke o morals and there you shall find him commending iob to the skyes as a good and holy man by his temptations not soyled but much anced in vertue these places for ought i know are of your owne deuising to be thus applied and there fore i will neuer striue about them though when occasion shal serue it will appeare that your answers to austins and gregories testimonies are but shifts novv before i depart from this large question of iustification i vvill handle yet one other question vvhich commonly ariseth about it it is i proo e that it may so be first out of these vvordes of our sauiour many shall say vnto me in that day lord lord haue vve not prop cied in thy name haue vve not cast out diuels haue vve not done many miracles to vvhom j will confesse that i neuer knevve you depart from mee all yee that vvorke iniquitie that these man beleeued in christ and persvvaded themselues assuredly to be of the elect appeareth by their confident calling of him lord lord and the rest that follovveth yet christ declareth manifestly that they vvanted charity in saying that they vvere vvorkers of iniquitie your proofe that they had a iustifying faith is too slender they called him lord what if they had called him sauiour must they needs therefore haue had saith the luke rich man in hell calles vpon abraham by the name of father shall i conclude as you doe when the king went to see his guestes he found there a man not attired in his wedding garment and therefore commanded him to be cast into vtter darknes this man had faith or else he had not been admitted vnto that table which signifieth the sacraments yet wanted charitie which to be the wedding garment beside the euidence of the text is also prooued where in expresse tearmes the garments of christs spouse is declared to be the righteousnesse and good vvorkes of the saintes and that with great reason for as s paul teacheth faith shall not remaine after this life with what instrument then trow you will the protestant lay hold on christs righteousnesse that charitie is that wedding garment s hierome vpon the same place doth witnesse saying that it is the fulfilling of our lord commandements and s gregor e doth in expresse wordes define it vvhat saith he must vve vnderstand by the vvedding garment but charitie so doe s hilarie and origin and s chrysostom vpon that place parables are no further any proofes than the meaning of them is certainly knowne but all your expositions of this are at least vncertaine the table signifieth the sacraments what baptisme too and your other fiue or how many and what sacraments besides your consequence is very feeble was no man euer admitted to the sacraments that made shew of faith when indeed he had none your glossa ordin ad mat ordinarie glosse expounds it of being in the church chrysost amp gregor apud thomam in atena ad mat chrysostom of the scriptures which sit at the table of the scriptures gregory of the church he commeth into the mariage saith gregorie but without a wedding garment that hath faith in the church but not charitie i might in like sort examine the rest of the parable and finde great diuersities of opinions as in such cases there must needs be but to the poynt first i say many hypocrites are in the church that haue not so much as a perswasion of the truth of the scripture and so absolutely want their mariage garment secondly i adde that this man and many other might haue a generall beleefe and yet not rest vpon god for iustification by christ without which faith there is no place for any man in heauen thirdly let it be granted that charitie is the mariage garment what get you by it vnlesse you can prooue that the faith this man had was a true iustifying faith which you can neuer possibly doe the generall meaning of the parable seemes to be no more but this that many man thrust into the church who when the day of trial comes will be found to haue no interest to the kingdome of heauen which our sauiours conclusion shewes math many are called but few are chosen i denie not that sentence shall be giuen according to workes but that they which want workes haue faith this is the poynt in question and this can neuer be prooued by this parable the like argument is made of the foolish virgin who were part of the kingdome of god and therefore had faith which is the gate and enterance into the seruice of god yes in the house of god they aspired vnto more then ordinary perfection hauing professed virginitie yet either carried away with vaine glorie as s gregorie takes it or not giuing themselues to the workes of mercy spirituall and corporall as s chrysostom expoundes it briefely not continuing in their former charitie for faith once had cannot after the protestant doctrine bee lost were shut out of the kingdome of heauen albeit they presumed strongly on the assurance of their saluation as is apparant by their confident demaunding to bee let in for they said lord lord open vnto vs the very like indeede and as vncertaine as the former math these virgin were part of god kingdome in profession but not in election and therefore neuer had iustifying faith the perfectio you fancie might well be attained to without true faith especially the profession of such perfection which is all that they had for ought that can be proued by the text if you vnderstood the protestant doctrine as well as you would seeme to doe you would know that we hold it as vnpossible to lose charitie as to lose faith affirming that he which hath not both to the end neuer had either their confident demaunding to be let in shewes rather their desire than their hope and yet how many hope without true faith in christ is it not generally the case of all you papists many of the princes beleeued in christ but did not confesse him for they loued more the glory of man then the glory of god what can bee more euident then that these man had faith when the holy ghost saith expresly that they beleeued in christ which is the onely acte of faith and yet were destitute of charitie which preferreth the glory and seruice of god before all things in this world they might ioh rest vpon him as the messiah and yet not to iustification for who knowes not that the iewes and especially the princes or chiefe man amongst them look for the messiah as a temporall deliuerer not as a spirituall sauiour beside they might haue a true iustifying faith and loue too and yet be led away in this point by vaine glorie or feare as ioh amp nicodemus was who came to christ by night and math peter who denied his sauiour by swearing and cursing and yet lost not either his faith or charitie by it though he sinned grieuously against both faith and charitie in that fearefull deniall this place of s iames what shall it profit my brother if any man say that he hath faith but hath not vvorkes what shall his faith be able to saue supposeth very playnelie that a man may haue faith without good workes that is without charitie but that it shall auaile him nothing you suppose that which will neuer be prooued that the apostle takes works for charitie doe you thinke that they against whom the apostle writes would grant that they were without the loue of god the gnosticks were neuer so absurd but the question was whether a man that profest iesus christ to bee the sauiour of the world were not by this saued how lewdly soeuer he demeaned himselfe caluin saith that the apostle speakes of a shadow of faith which is a bare knowledge of the articles of our creed but not of a iustifying faith without doubt hee was little acquainted with that kinde of faith by which protestant be iustified but he directly speakes of such a faith as abraham was iustified by saying that that faith did worke vvith his vvorkes and vvas made perfect by the vvorkes was this but a shadow of faith caluin saith truly that the apostle speaks of a dead faith which we say can iustifie no man and of faith in profession not in truth the former is plaine iam faith if it haue no workes is dead in it selfe verse faith without workes is dead the latter appeares thus ve s though a man sa he haue faith verse shew me thy faith by thy workes you answere he was little acquainted with our kinde of faith when you can prooue he tolde you so i will beleeue you but you adde further that he speakes directly of such a faith as abraham was iustified by true for of such a faith these man did make profession therefore the apostle shewes that this faith of abraham was a liuing faith that wrought by charitie and was acknowledged by god himselfe to be such in regard of the workes issuing from it such as theirs is not if it haue no workes which are the euidences of a true faith as verse breathing is a certaine proofe of life but they reply that this faith is likened vnto the faith of the diuell amp therefore cannot be a iustifying faith that followeth not for an excellent good thing may be like vnto a badde in some things as diuels in nature are not onely like but the very same as angels bee euen so a full christian faith may be well likened vnto a diuels faith when it is naked and voyd of good works in tvvo points first in both there is a perfect knovvledge of all things reuealed secondly this knovvledge shall not stead them anie vvhit but onely serue vnto their greater condemnation because that knovving the vvill of their master they did it not and in this respect s iames compareth them together now there are many pointes vvherein these faiths doe differ but this one is principall that christians out of a goodly and deuoute affection doe vvillinglie submitte their vnderstanding vnto the rules of faith beleeuing things aboue humane reason yes such as seeme sometimes contrarie to it but the diuell against his vvill beleeues all that god hath reuealed because by his naturall capacitie he knovves that god can teach nor testifie any vntruth we do not say that it is likened to the diuels faith but that the apostle shevves them how insufficiently they reason from the beleeuing the truth of god to iustification for the diuels saith he beleeue also yes more then beleeue say i haue one of your preparatory works euen feare of damnation againe that faith may bee vvithout charitie is proued out of these vvords of the same second chapter euer as the body vvithout the spirit is dead so also faith without vvorkes is dead hence thus i argue albeit the body be dead vvithout the soule yet is it a true naturall body in it selfe euen so faith is perfect in the kind of faith although vvithout charitie it auayle not to life euerlasting i answered you before out of cardinall caietan ad ac caietan that the apostle speakes not of the soule but of breath so that the comparison stands thus as the bodie that breathes not is dead so faith that brings not forth good works is dead lastly in true reason it is manifest that faith may be vvithout charity for they haue seuerall seates in the soule one being in the vvill and the other in the vnderstanding they haue distinct obiectes faith respecting the truth of god and charitie the goodnes of god your reason is without truth they haue diverse seats in the soule and distinct obiects therefore the one may be without the other first i deny the antecedent in respect of the former part thereof for faith that iustifies is not in the vnderstanding but in the will secondly i deny your consequence altogether because it proues no more but only that there is no naturall necessity of their being together in regard of each other our doctrine is that they are alwaies ioyned because the spirit that giues a man faith to iustification doth also giue him true inherent righteousnes together with that faith in christ neither doth faith necessarily suppose charitie as charitie doth faith for vve cannot loue him of vvhom vvee neuer heard neither yet doth charitie naturally flovv out of faith but by due consideration of the goodnes of god and of his benefits amp loue towards vs into which good and deuoute considerations fevv man doe enter in comparison of them vvho are led into the broade vvay of iniquity through their inordinate passions this according to the truth and yet more different in the protestant opinion for faith laies hold on christs righteousnes and receiues that in but charitie can receiue nothing in as m perkins witnesseth but giues it selfe forth in all duties of the first and second table the like answer i make to the other two points y t follow faith doth not say you necessarily suppose charity as charitie doth faith neither doth charity naturally flow out of faith what then therefore is not euery man sanctified that is iustified i deny the consequence he ioh rom gal that beleeues in christ hath the spirit of christ and where he is there is sanctification that with you adde of the impossiblity of our saluation if i rightly vnderstand it which i can hardly do it is so confused is not to the purpose yet we may conclude out of the former part of the discourse as before faith receiues in charitie doth not therefore they are not alwaies together the consequence is naught as if vertues of diverse effects could not be giuen by the spirit at one time and alwaies keepe together in the soule iustified and sanctified now sir if they could not applie vnto themselues christs righteousnes without fulfilling all duties of the first and second table they should neuer applie it to them for they hould it impossible to fulfill all those duties so that this necessarie linking of charity with faith maketh their saluation not only very euill assured but altogither impossible for charitie is the fulnes of the law which they hold impossible and then if the assurance of their saluation must needs be ioyned with such an impossibilitie they may assure themselues that by that faith they can neuer come to saluation i will do the best i can to vnderstand and examine what you say in this discourse wherein me thinkes you would perswade vs that this linking of faith and charity together makes our saluation altogether impossible because it requires of vs the fulfilling of the law that we may thereby applie christs righteousnes to our selues which we hold to be impossible now vpon this impossibilitie it should follow in your opinion that we may assure our selues we can neuer come to saluation by this faith all the matter lies in this proposition that the ioyning of these vertues exacts the fulfilling of the law to applie christ by which hath no kind of truth in it for first the hauing of charitie doth not bind vs to keepe the law but enables vs in some measure to that dutie which we were bound to before secondlie it is not the lincking of these two that doth enable vs but the hauing of charitie that is of iustifying grace lastlie though they come and stay together yet haue they as their seuerall natures and effects so their seuerall ends also faith seruing to obtaine iustification charity to cause a holy conuersation if i haue mistaken you it is against my will if there be any thing else in it that may make for you or against vs let me know it and i will yeeld to it or answere it let vs annex vnto these plaine authorities of holy scripture one euident testimonie of antiquitie that most incorrupti s augustine saith flatly that faith may well be vvithout charitie but it cannot profile vs vvithout charitie and that one god is vvorshipped sometimes out of the church but that vnskilfully yet is it he also that one faith is had without charitie and that also out of the church neither therfore is not faith for there is one god one faith one baptisme and one i aculate catholike church in which god is not serued only but in which only he is truly serued neither in which alone faith is kept n which only faith is kept with charitie so that faith and that only true faith of which the apostle speaketh one god one faith may be and is an many without charitie in aug de tri nit lib c the former place alleaged augustine hath no such word and if he had the answere is easie that he speakes not of that faith wherby we trust in god for iustification but of that which is onelie an acknowledgement of the truth of scripture in aug contra crescen lib cap the later thus he writes as one god is worshipped ignorantly euen out of the church neither therefore is not he so one faith is had without charity euen out of the church neither therefore is not it for there is one god one faith one baptisme one incorrupt catholike church not in which alone god is worshipped but in which alone one god is pi rightly worshipped nor in which alone one faith is held but in which alone one faith with charity is held nor in which alone one baptisme is had but in which alone one baptisme is salubriter healthfully had in which discourse any man may see that austin speakes of such a faith as beleeues the truth of scripture to which purpose a little before he shewed that the diuels also had the same faith or at least beleeued the same things of christ that we doe in the church and this faith which is indeed the same the apostle speakes of may be and is often without charitie and yet by your leaue a man may reasonablie doubt whether this assent to the scripture be wrought by the spirit of god in euery one that professeth religion according to the truth of his perswasion and be not rather in many an opinion receiued from me as for the most part amongst you papists who rest vpon the authoritie of man vnder the name of the church in this very point the protestant bold asseuerations that they cannot be parted are great but their proofes very slender and scarce worth the disprouing it becomes a christian to be bold in matters of faith especiallie when it is gaine said what our proofes are it shall better be seene hereafter if it please god in the meane while how strong yours are set euery man iudge with indifferencie the first he that hath not care of his ovvne hath denied his faith therfore saith includeth that good vvorke of prouiding for our owne ans that faith there seemes to signifie not that faith whereby we beleeue all things reuealed or the protestant the certainty of their saluation but for fidelity and faithfull performance of that which we haue promised in bapti me which is to keepe all god commandements one of the which is to prouide for our children and for them that we haue charge of so that he who hath no such care ouer his owne charge hath denied his faith that is violated his promise in baptisme there is also another ordinary answere supposing faith to be taken there for the christian beleefe to wit that one may deny his faith two waies either in flat denying any article of faith or by doing something that is contrary to the doctrine of our faith now he that hath no care of his owne doth not deny any article of his faith but committeth a fact contrary to the doctrine of his faith so that not faith but the doctrine of faith or our promise in baptisme includeth good workes these reasons are such as to my best remembrance i neuer read in any protestant to this purpose if you haue you should haue quoted the places but howsoeuer i thinke neither we nor you will be bound to maintaine all the arguments that haue been brought in all questions to proue the doctrines we seuerally hold if it had bin your purpose to deale throughly in this point you might haue found out better reasons then these though not better for your turne if you aske where i will shew you god willing in another treatise for the answering of these arguments is nothing to master perkins reformed catholike nor the reason of any moment but as it may well be suspected of your owne deuising that you might make babies to dallie with all there are among you that beleeue not for he knovv vvho beleeued and vvho was to betray him opposing treason to faith as if he had said faith conteined in it selfe fidelitie this argument is farre fetched and little worth for albeit faith hath not fidelitie and loue alwaies necessarily ioyned with it yet falling from faith may well draw after it hatred and treason yes ordinarily wickednes goeth before falling from faith and is the cause of it which was iudas case whom our sauiour there taxed for he blinded with coue ousnesse did not beleeue christs doctrine of the blessed sacrament and by incredulity opened the diuell a high way to his hart to negotiate treason in it first i demaund in what the doctrine of the sacraments could hinder iudas from growing rich y t the fault of his not beleeuing it should lye vpon his couetousnes secondly i wonder how it can be proued that iudas did not beleeue it if you ground your conceipt vpon that of ioh john as it is likly you do first proue that our sauiour spake there of the sacrament thirdly it is not plaine by anie place of scripture that iudas vnbeleefe in that doctrine opened the way to the diuell nay rather the text laies the blame vpon his ioh couetousnes math and malice stirred vp by our sauiours defect of mary against him when she had bestowed such costlie oyntments vpon him in bethania they obiect that vvho saith bee knovves god and doth not keepe his commandements is a lyar ans he is then a lyar in graine who professing the only true knowledge of god yet blusheth not to say that it is impossible to keepe his commandements but to the obiection knowing god in that place is taken for louing of god as i knovv ye not that is i loue you not our lord knowes the way of the iust that is approues it loues it so he that knowes god keepes his commandements as christ himselfe testifieth jf any loue me he vvill keepe my vvord and he that loueth me not vvill not keepe my vvords lastly they say with s paul that the iust man liueth by faith but if faith giue life then it cannot be without charity ans that faith in a iust man is not without hope and charity by all which conioyned he liueth and not by faith alone but faith is in a sinfull and vniust man without charitie who holding fast his former beleefe doth in transgressing god commaundements breake the bands of charitie and so it remaines most certaine that faith may be and too too often is without the sacred society of charitie these obiections were not worth the making neither will i wast time and paper in examining your answeres to them by merit vnderstand any thing or any worke whereby god fauour and life euerlasting is procured and that for the dignitie and excellencie of the worke or thing done or a good worke done binding him that receiueth it to repaie the like obserue that three things are necessarie to make a worke meritorious first that the worker be the adopted son of god and in the state of grace secondly that the worke proceed from grace and be referred to the honor of god the third is the promise of god through christ to reward the worke and because our aduersaries either ignorantly or of malice do slaunder this our doctrine in saying vntruly that we trust not in christs merits nor need not god mercy for our saluation but will purchase it by our owne workes we charge you and that trulie without ignorance or slaunder and according to your doctrine of merits that you need neither christs merits nor god mercie for so much of your purchase of euerlasting life as is made by good workes for if your workes be such as that ex rigor iustitiae in the rigour of iustice they deserue euerlasting life as wages what neede they either christs blood or god mercie to make them meritorious the rom ephesians heb vse of christs blood is to wash away sinne where there is no sin what should christs blood doe rom sess cap vl now to him that workes the wages is not counted of fauour but of debt i will here set downe what the councell of t ent doth teach concerning merits life euerlasting is to be proposed to them that vvorke vvell and hope well to the end both as grace of mercy promised to the sonnes of god through christ iesus and as a reward by the promise of the same god to be faithfully rendred vnto their vvorkes and merits so that we hold eternall life to be both a grace aswell in respect of god gree promise through christ as also for that the first grace out of which they issue was freely bestowed vpon vs and that also it is a reward in iustice due partly by the promise of god and in part of the dignity of good workes vnto the worker if he perseuere and hold on vnto the end of his life or by truerepentance lise to the same estate againe the councell of trent hath as much as well it could made a shew of some reformation but indeed retained for the most part the former errours of her antichristian church you also to mend the matter according to the policie of the craftie councell picke out a sentence and propound it as the whole doctrine of the councell concerning merits the same afterward you expound but so as that neithe text nor the glosse are sufficient to make your whole doctrine knowne to vs for whereas you claime heauen of god as wages due to the deserts of your workes here is no mention but only of reward yet somwhat is slipt from you whereby the councels dealing may well grow into suspition for whereas that sayes no more but that it is a reward by the promise of god to be faithfully rendred to their workes and merits you tel vs that it is a reward in iustice due partly by the promise of god and in part for the dignitie of good works where i would faine know of you how you part this debt what part is due vpon promise what vpon desert for it may wel be though the reward be due vpon promise now god hath promised that it was simplie due for the dignitie of the worke whether god had promised it or no and then it was a small fauour of god to make vs a promise of that to which we had full interest by desert before this promise so that he could not in iustice but pay vs our wages for our worke though he had not promised it and indeed this is the verie maine point of your doctrine of merits howsoeuer you blaunch it with the name of grace i proue it first by the councell it selfe then by andradius the expounder of the councels meaning concil trident sess cap seeing that christ iesus sayes the councell iugiter virtutem influat doth continually infuse vertues into them that are iustified as the head into the members which vertue alwaies goes before accompanieth and followeth their good workes and without which they could in no sort be acceptable to god and meritorious we must beleeue that there is nothing else wanting to them that are iustified why they should not be thought diuinae leg plene satisfecisse full e to haue satisfied the law of god as farre as the estate of this life requires by those workes in deo sacta that are done in god and to haue truly deserued at their time euerlasting life prouided that they depart in the estate of grace andradius who was present at the councill and one that debated matters with other doctors though he had no voyce in determining because he was not a bishop yet he could not chuse but perfectly vnderstand the poynts that were agreed vpon otherwise we may be sure he should neuer haue been suffered to vndertake the defence of the councill as hee hath been if not chosen to it he then thus opens the matter andrad orthod exp lib pag that euerlasting felicitie is no lesse due to the workes of the righteous than euerlasting torments are to their sinnes that obey not the gospell nor know god that heauenly felicitie which the scripture calles the rewards and wages of the righteous is not so much freely and liberally bestowed vpon them by god as it is due to their workes which he proues thus when paul saith andrad vbi supra andradius would shew that abraham was iustified by faith and not by workes he doth it especially by this reason rom to him that worketh the wages is not counted of fauour but of debt therefore if abrahams righteousnes were the wages of his workes it ought to be called debt rather than grace for the mercedis ratio cum nomine gra ae ex aduerso pugnat nature of wages is directly contrary to the name of grace vpon this reason he concludes that euerlasting felicitie must not be counted according to grace but according to debt and a little after andrad pag therefore if any wages be due to the worthie actions of the righteous there is in them vera amp integra ratio the true and whole nature of merit this then is the doctrine of the church of rome concerning merits that the good workes of them that haue the first iustification do truly and wholy deserue euerlasting felicitie of god as wages due to them by debt not by grace let no man be deceiued because to colour the matter they make mention of vertue comming continually from christ as from the vine into the branches for this is nothing else but the increase of grace whereby christians are enabled to doe good workes and added no more worthines to the action than should be in it if this grace were receiued from christ all at one instant as for the substance of it it is at the time of our iustification in infants baptized there is a kind of merit or rather dignity of adopted sonnes of god by his grace powred into their soules in baptisme whereby they are made heires of the kingdome of heauen but all that arriue to the yeares of discretion must by the good vse of the same grace either meritlife or for want of such fruit of it fall into the miserable state of death infants baptized if they belong to god election haue indeed the prerogatiue to be god children and thereby an interest to the kingdome of heauen as their inheritance all that come to yeeres of discretion must bring foorth fruites of faith and shall haue reward for them in heauen not vpon merit because their best workes are defectiue but only vpon god gratious promise and mercifull acceptance in iesus christ touching merits we consent in two conclusions with them the first conclusion that merits are so farre forth necessarie that without them there can be no saluation the second that christ our mediatour and redeemer is the roote and fountaine of all merit the popish church placeth merits within man making two sorts thereof the merit of the person and the merit of the worke the merit of the person is a dignity in the person whereby it is worthy of life euerlasting and this as they say is to be found in infants dying after baptisme who though they want good workes yet are they not voide of this kinde of merite for which they receiue the kingdome of heauen the merit of the worke is a dignitie or excellencie in the worke whereby it is made fitte and inabled to deserue life euerlasting for the doer and workes as they teach are meritorious two waies first by couenant because god hath made a promise of reward vnto them secondly by their owne dignitie for christ hath merited that our workes might merit and this is the substance of their doctrine from it we dissent in these points i wee renounce all personall merits that is all merits within the person of any meere man ii and we renounce all merit of workes that is all merit of any worke done by any meere man whatsoeuer and the true merit whereby wee looke to attaine the fauour of god and life euerlasting is to bee found in the person of christ alone who is the storehouse of all our merits whose prerogatiue it is to bee the person alone in whom god is well pleased god fauour is of infinite dignitie and no creature is able to do a worke which may counteruaile the fauour of god saue christ alone who by reason of the dignitie of his person being not a meere man but god man or man god hee can doe such workes as are of endlesse dignitie euery way answerable to the fauour of god and therefore sufficient to merit the same for vs and though a merit or meritorious worke agree onely to the person of christ yet is it made ours by imputation for as his righteousnesse is made ours so are his merits depending thereon but his righteousnesse is made ours by imputation as i haue shewed hence ariseth an other point namely that as christs righteousnesse is made ours really by imputation to make vs righteous so we by the merit of his righteousnesse imputed to vs doe merit and deserue life euerlasting and this is our doctrine in a word the papists maintaine the merits of their owne workes but we renounce them all and rest onelie on the merit of christ with the former catholike doctrine m perkins would be thought to agree in two points first that merits are necessary to saluation that christ is the roote and fountaine of all merit master perkins in the poynt of our consent with you meant not merits as you take them and as himselfe before had defined them but onely as good workes which the ancient writers oftentimes call merits not because they truly and wholy haue the nature of merits as andrad vbi supra andradius speaks of them but for that they are not performed without labour on our part and shall haue reward on god part in heauen but soone after like vnto a shrewd cowe ouerthrowes with his heele the good milke he had giuen before renouncing all merittes in euery man sauing only in the person of christ whose prerogatiue saith he it is to be the person alone in whom god is well pleased this dealing of yours is more common with you than commendable he that meant plainly would take things as they lie as farre as reasonably he may and not draw matters out of diverse heads to confound the readers vnderstanding and hide the force of his aduersaries disputation but i must be faine to follow you though you follow not master perkins then he addeth that they good protestant by christs merits really imputed to them do merit life euerlasting euen as by his righteousnes imputed vnto them they are iustified and made righteous to which i answere that we most willingly confesse our blessed sauiours merits to be infinite and of such diuine efficacy that he hath not only merited at his fathers hands both pardon for all faults and grace to doe all good workes but also that his true servant works should be meritorious of life euerlasting that our workes should bee accepted and rewarded of god our sauiour hath merited but that being imperfect they should haue the true and whole nature of merit no infinitnes nor diuine efficacie can deserue or procure for it is a manifest contradiction that this or that work should haue need of pardon and yet fully satisfie the law of god and by that satisfaction deserue euerlasting life as wages at god hands as for the reall imputation of his merit to vs we esteeme as a fained imagination composed of contrarieties for if it be really in vs why do they call it imputed and if it be ours only by god imputation then is it not in vs really you make your selfe more worke than you need master perkins doth not say it is really in vs but really imputed to vs not as you trifle by a supposed imputation but in deed and truth wee being the members of christ our head by faith in him further to say that he only is the person in whom god is vvell pleased is to giue the lie vnto many plaine texts of holy scriptures abraham vvas called the friend of god therefore god vvas vvell pleased in him moses vvas his beloued dauid vvas a man according vnto his ovvne hart god loued christs disciples because they loued him briefly all the christians at rome vvere truly called of s paul the beloued of god and therefore although god be best pleased in our sauiour and for his sake is pleased in all others yet is he not only pleased in him but in all his faithfull servant it is christs priuiledge to be the person in whom god is fully pleased as in one who by his excellencie of nature being god euerlasting and man absolutely pure deserues his loue which all other man attaine to in their measure not by the merit but acceptation of their persons novv to that vvhich he saith that they haue no other meritte then christs imputed to them as they haue no other righteousnesse but by imputation i take it to be true and therefore they do very ingenuously and iustly renounce all kind of merittes in their stayned and defiled vvorkes but let them tremble at that vvhich thereupon necessarily follovveth it is that as they haue no righteousnes nor merit of heauen but only by a supposed imputation so they must looke for no heauen but by imputation for god as a most vpright iudge vvill in the end repay euery man according to his vvorth vvherfore not finding any eall vvorthines in protestant but only in conceipt his revvard shall be giuen them ansvverablie in conceipt only vvhich is euidently gathered out of s augustine vvhere he saith that the revvard ca goe before the merit not be giuen to a man before be be vvorthie of it for saith he v at vvere more iniust then that and what is more iust then god where he concludeth that we must not be so hardly as once to demaund much iesse so impudent as to assure ourselues of that crovvne before vve haue deserued it seeing then that the protestant by this their proctour renounce all such merit and desert they must needs also renounce their part of heauen and not presume so much as once to demaund it according vnto s augustines sentence vntill they haue first renounced their erronious opinions we are really members of christs mysticall bodie and so haue an interest in the reall imputation of his merits beside wee haue also true though not perfect righteousnes inherent in vs amp good works in some poore measure sutable thereunto see article part article according to which we certainly looke for our reward of god not for the worthines of those workes but for his gratious acceptance of them and vs in iesus christ so that we demaund not our reward before our worke which austin after the phrase of the ancient calles merits but denie our worke to bee of such a value as mans pride would make it now to requite your kindnes i beg you by the mercies of god and the loue of iesus christ that you doe not lay claime to euerlasting life as the wages of servant least it be denied you as an inheritance belonging to sonnes that our doctrine is truth and theirs falshoode i will make manifest by sundrie reasons and then answere their arguments to the contrarie the first shall be taken from the properties and conditions that must be in a worke meritorious and they are foure i a man must doe it of himselfe and by himselfe for if it bee done by an other the merit doth not properly belong to the doer ii a man must doe it of his owne free will and pleasure not of due debt for when wee doe that which wee are bound to doe wee doe no more but our dutie iii the worke must be done to the profit of an other who thereupon must bee bound to repay the like iv the reward and the worke must be in proportion equall for if the reward bee more then the worke it is not a reward of desert but a gift of good will hence followes a notable conclusion that christs manhood considered apart from his godhead cannot merit at god hand though it be more excellent euery way then all man and angels for being thus considered it doth nothing of it selfe but by grace receiued from the godhead though it also bee without measure secondly christs manhood is a creature and in that regarde bounde to doe whatsoeuer it doth thirdly christ as man cannot giue any thing to god but that which hee receiued from god therefore cannot the manhood properly by it selfe merit but onely as it is personally vnited vnto the godhead of the son and if this be so then much lesse can any meere man or any angell merit yes it is a madnes to thinke that either our actions or persons should be capable of any merit whereby wee might attaine to life eternall but m perkins vvill neuerthelesse proue and that by sundry reasons that their doctrine is the truth it selfe and ours falshood first by a sorry short syllogisme containing more then one vvhole page it is taken out of the properties of a meritorious vvorke which must be saith he foure first that the worke be done of our selues without the helpe of another secondly that it be not othervvise due debte thirdly that it be done to the benefit of another fourthly that the worke and revvard be equall in proportion these proprieties he sets dovvne pithagorically vvithout any proofe but inferreth thereon as though he had proued them inuincibly that christs man hood seperated from the god head cannot merit because vvhatsoeuer he doth he doth it by grace receiued and should be othervvise due he might in like manner as truly say that christs manhood vnited to the godhead could not merit neither for he receiued his godhead from his father and vvhatsoeuer he doth is therefore his fathers by due debte and so the good man if he vvere let alone vvould disappoint vs vvholy of all merits as vvell the imputed of christs as of all ours done by vertue of his grace the syllogisme that troubles you so with the length of it is this euery worke that merits euerlasting life must be done of and by the worker himselfe not of debt to the profit of god with proportion to the reward no worke of man can be so done therefore no worke of man can merit euerlasting life is not this a perilous long syllogisme trow you to take vp more than a whole page if this great scholler that so often blames master perkins ignorance would for i wil not doubt but he could haue distinguished the syllogisme from the explication of the proposition he would not haue been so much offended with it sure there was small cause hee should be if he say truly afterward that master perkins reason was nakedly proposed or trie whether himselfe can make it any shorter or compare it with his owne tedious answer containing three whole pages in quarto in a smaller letter but what if there be another syllogisme also implied in this reason as there is this if the manhood of christ properly by it selfe could not merit then can no man merit but the manhood of christ properly by it selfe could not merit therefore no man can the consequence of the proposition is prooued because the manhood of christ is more excellent euery way than all both man and angels the assumption is made manifest because euery worke of christs manhood considered apart from the godhead would be defectiue in three points concerning merit to the two former you answer that whereas master perkins saith christs manhood could not merit because he did nothing of himselfe but by grace receiued and that that he did was due that he might as truly say that his manhood could not merit vnited to the godhead your reason is for that he receiued his godhead from his father and whatsoeuer he doth is therefore his fathers by due debt but your reason is false for see article par article christ had his sonship as i may speake of his father for the propertie of the godhead is to be of it selfe yet there is not any thing due from the son to the father more than from the father to the son if they be of equall nature and dignitie so that this latter point disproues the former because it inferres a superioritie of the father ouer the son and so an inequalitie which at no hand may be granted wherefore vve must a little ist his foure forged proprieties of merit and touching the first i say that one may by the good vse of a thing receiued by free gift merit and deserue much euen at his hands that gaue it for example the father bestovves a farme vpon his son freely who may by often presenting his father of the pleasing fruits growing on the same deserue his further fauour yes he may by the commodity reaped out of that farme buy any thing that it shall please his father to set to sale as vvell as if he had neuer receiued the farme from his fathers gift which is so common a case and so sensible that euery man of meane vvitte may casily reach vnto it euen so by good manuring the gifts vvhich god freely bestovveth vpon vs vve may both merit the increase of them and according to his ovvne order and promise purchase thereby the kingdome of heauen vvhich is plainly proued in that parable of the talents giuen by a king to his servant the vvhich they imploying vvell and multiplying vvere therefore esteemed vvorthie of far greater and vvithall to be made partakers of their lord ioyes m perkins then vvas not a little ouerseene to put for the first proprietie of merit that it must be done by a man and of a man himselfe the first of the foure properties is that a man must doe it of himselfe and by himselfe you answere that one may merit by the good vse of a thing receiued by free gift but not if the vse of it also be of him of whom he should merit the son that receiues the farme receiues not withall continually from his father the power to vse the farme in that sort and much lesse the will and the vse it selfe but a man that hath receiued grace from god hath continually from him philipp both to will and to doe and therefore cannot properly merit of him the parable hath not one word of any merit onely it is said that the king commended his servant for imploying their talents well and gaue them authoritie ouer much because they had been faithfull in a little and further receiued them into his ioy but that he dealt thus with them vpon due debt or that they did truly merit is your glosse besides the text the second that a man must doe it of his ovvne free will and pleasure and not of due debt carrieth in shevv an opposition but indeed there is no contradiction in it for a man may and euery honest man doth of his ovvne free vvill and pleasure pay his due debt but let vs pardon the disorder of vvords his meaning being nothing else but that the payment of that vvhich is othervvise due debt cannot be any meritorious vvorke is there not a contradiction in the meaning your selfe confesse it by and by where you expound it disorder in words is when they are not set in such order as they should be here is no such fault if there bee any it is that he might haue spoken plainer but any man know his meaning by his words well enough to vvhich s augustine doth ansvvere in these vvords o great goodnes of god to vvhom vvhen vve did ovve seruice by condition of our estate as bond man do to their lord yet hath he promised againe and againe the reward of friends s austin answers nothing against vs or for you it is free for god to promise a reward as wee gladly acknowledge he doth euen to those workes that are due but an action of dutie cannot be made to put on the true and whole nature of merit which is the question in vvhich there is couched a comparison vvhich being laide in the light vvill much helpe to the vnderstanding of this matter he that hath a slaue or a bond man may lavvfully exact of him all kind of seruice vvithout any vvages bread and a vvhippe saith a philosopher serue for a slaue novv suppose the master to be soueraigne gouernour of a state then if it please him to make his manfree and vvithall a member of his common vveale the same man by performing many good offices to the state may iustly deserue of his prince as great revvard and promotion as any other of his subiects and yet may his lord and old master say truly to him all this that thou hast done or couldest do is but due debt vs to me considering that thou vvast my bond man so fareth it vvith vs in respect of god all that vve can do is due debt vnto him because he hath made vs and endovved vs vvith all that vve either be or haue yet it hath pleased him as a most kind lord to set vs at liberty through christ and to make vs citizens of the saints and as capable of his heauenlie riches as the angels if vve vvill do our endeuour to deserue them and vvhereas he might haue exacted all that euer vve could do vvithout any kind of recompence yet he of his inestimable goodnes tovvard vs doth neither bind vs to do all vve can do and yet for doing that little vvhich he commandeth hath by promise bound himselfe to repay vs a large recompence the coparison you shew vs is fained by you not intended by austin and if it be granted you makes nothing to the purpose no more indeede doth the conclusion of your whole discourse for it saith no more than wee yeeld that god wil recompence those seruices which are debt on our part and that exceeding bountifully but not vpon their desert by which we may well vnderstand those words of our sauiour vvhen you haue done all these things that are commanded you say that you are vnprofitable servant vve haue done that vve ought to doo true by our natiue condition we were bound to performe not only all these things that be now commaunded but whatsoeuer else it should haue pleased god to command and this we must alwaies confesse to preserue true humility in vs yet god hath bettered our estate through christ and so ighly aduaunced vs that we not only be citizens or saints but his sonnes and heires and thereby in case to deserue of him a heauenlie crowne it hath no shew of reason in it that our sauiour should teach his apostles whom hee had truly freed that they should say they are vnprofitable servant because they doe that which they were once bound to doe but now are not as if a man that was once bound to pay double custome because he was a stranger should count himselfe vnprofitable to the king though being absolutely freed he pay the same custome still because once forsooth he was by dutie to pay so much i would faine know what dutie we were bound to doe in our naturall estate from which wee are freed in our spirituall for to my seeming our bond is doubled both in equitie because we haue receiued so vndeserued kindnes and in god intent who hath giuen vs his grace that wee might doe him better seruice and this is s ambrose exposition vpon the place that ambrose giueth no such exposition his own words shall testifie therefore saith ambros ad luke ambrose as thou doest not onely not say to thy servant sit downe but requirest further seruice of him so neither doth god content himselfe with one work or labour of thine because while we liue we must alwaies work therefore acknowledge thy selfe to be a servant plurimis obsequijs defoenerarum bound to very many seruices non te praeferas doe not extoll thy selfe because thou article called the son of god his fauour is to be acknowledged but thy nature not to be vnknowne neither bragge if thou hast serued well which thou wert bound to doe these are his words out of which no man can wring any such interpretation we owe seruice though we be sonnes for it is plaine ambrose speaks of our seruice after we are regenerate first because he saith we must worke alwaies secondly because he mentions hauing serued well which befalles no man in his naturall estate before grace saint chrysostom pondering these words let vs say taketh it for a holsome counsaile for vs to say that we be vnprofitable servant least pride destroy our good workes and then god will say that we be good and faithfull servant as it is recorded againe we may truly say when we haue done all things commaunded that we are vnprofitable servant as venerable bede our most learned countriman interpreteth because of all that vve doe no cammoditie riseth vnto god our lord in himselfe vvho is such an infinite ocean of all goodnesses that he vvanteth nothing whereupon dauid saith that thou article my god because thou standest in need of no good that i can doe you should haue quoted the place chrysost ad luke chrysostom in his homily vpon that chapter saith no such thing but wheresoeuer he saith it if he say it at all it cannot prooue that we are not bound to doe good seruice in the state of grace nor that wee can merit at god hands nor that you interpret s luke aright wherefore then is it alleaged theophyl ad luke theophylact who followes chrysostom euery where expounds it of our seruice after grace and concludes vpon it that we may not for the doing of any worke necessarily require reward or honour for it shall be of the lord bountie if he bestow any thing vpon vs for it and woe be to vs if we doe not our dutie and cyril apud thomam in caten ad luke cyrill is wholy of the same opinion who also denies that which before you affirmed that subiects can deserue any thing of their soueraigne consider saith he that they which rule amongst vs doe not thanke any of their subiects if they doe any of those things that are enioyned them but oftentimes by their bountie stirring their subiects affections they breed in them a greater desire to serue so god requires seruice of vs by right now because he is mercifull and good he promiseth honours to them that labour and the greatnes of his bountie ouerpasseth the paines of his subiects your glossa interlin ad luke glosse saith that we are servant because we are bought with a price vnprofitable because god hath no neede of our good workes or because our present sufferings are not worthie of the glorie that shall be reueiled in vs which reasons of our vnprofitablenes beda apud thomam thomas also brings out of bede so doe your glossa ordin amp lyra ordinarie glosse and lyra expound it making vs servant euen after regeneration as august in psalm austin truly saith that christ did not make vs free man of servant but of euill servant good servant and thus we fall vpon the third property of m perkins meritorious worke which is that it be done to the profit of another and say that albeit god in himselfe receiue no profit by our workes yet doth he in the administration of his holy common weale the church wherein good mens seruices do much pleasure him and in this sense is it said of saint paul that by cleansing our selues from vvicked vvorkes vve shall become vessels sanctified and profitable vnto our lord againe god is glorified by our good vvorkes that seeing your good vvorkes they may glorifie your father vvhich is in heauen finally god doth reioyce at the recouery of his lost children not onely good but also ezra amp daniel amp bad mens seruices may be said to profit god if euery thing that benefits his church must be held to be of profit to him but we neither can profit nor pleasure him nor glorifie him truly and properly but onely in his acceptation and so whatsoeuer reward shall be giuen for these seruices it proceedes from god gratious bountie not from our desert if then good man trauailing painfully in god vine yard do yeeld him outwardly both honor ioy and commoditie that may suffice to make their worke meritorious to the conclusion you inferre hereupon which is the proposition of a syllogisme to proue the maine point that our works are meritorious i answere by denying the consequence thereof and say that it doth not follow that our workes merit euerlasting life because our trauaile doth yeeld him outwardly honour ioy and glorie the reason of my deniall is this that a slaue may by his paines and seruice procure all these things to his master and that out of his loue to him and yet deserue nothing at his hands the assumption that should be added i denied and refuted in the former part of my answere m perkins fourth property is that the vvorke and revvard be equall in proportion if you pleaded for nothing but reward the sute were ended for we as i haue said before grant y t god will reward the least good worke of any of his children but the question is whether he doe this of his bountie onely or of necessitie being bound to it by the law of iustice this we denie you affirme viz that the good workes of a man iustified doe vere prome eri truly or of right deserue increase of grace euerlasting life and consecutionem the fruition of it if he depart in grace and also increase of glorie and further concil trident sess can you accurse all them to hell that say otherwise if he vnderstand arithmeticall proportion that is that they be equal in quantitie to wit the one to be as great or of as long continuance as the other then we deny this kind of equality to be requisite to merit there is another sort of proportion called by the philosopher ethic geometricall and the equality of that is taken by a reasonable correspondence of the one vnto the other as when a good office is giuen to a citizen of desert it may be that the honour and commoditie of the office is farre greater then was the merit of the man yet he being as well able to discharge it as another and hauing better deserued it is holden in true iustice worthie of it it is no true merit such as you auow it to be in vera amp integra ration meriti the true and whole nature of merit vnlesse it be fully answerable in value to the reward therefore to speake properly and truly the citizen you name doth not simply deserue the office but as your selfe confesse in comparison of other his fellow subiects so that though there were more in him than in other why the prince should bestow that place vpon him yet it is rather a gift than a debt else should the king offend against iustice if he did not giue it him in like manner in a game where masteries are tried the prize is giuen vnto him that doth best not because the value of the reward is iust as much worth as that act of the man who winneth it but for that such actiuity is esteemed worthy of such a recompence now the crowne of heauenly lorie is likened by s paul vnto a garland in a game where he a th that vve all runne but one carrieth avvay the prize and he that striueth for the masterie is not crovvned vnlesse he striue lavvfully it is also resembled vnto places of honour i vvill place thee ouer much and i goe to prouide you places grace is also in many places of scripture compared to seede for the seede of god tarrieth in him but a little eede cast into good ground and well manured bringeth forth abundance of corne briefely then such equality as there is betweene the well deseruing subiect and the office betweene him that striueth lawfully and the crowne betweene the seed and the corne is between the reward of heauen and the me t of a true servant of god and thus much of m perkins first argument more indeed to expl cate the nature and condition of merit then that his reason nakedly proposed did require it what shall i need to answer to your similitude of games since your selfe denie that it is truly and properly desert but to make the matter more plaine let vs a little consider it in this sort where there is an agreement as in these games though there be not properly any merit yet there may be somewhat that shal come neere to the nature of merit that there is no merit you yeeld in granting that the reward is more in value than the act of him that winneth notwithstanding if the prize be it what it will be propounded to them that shall not onely passe other man in the race but also runne home to the goale in such a space of time with such or such a carriage of the bodie without any kinde of stay or treading a haires breadth out of a path appointed with other like circumstances i grant that hee which obserues all these conditions exactly may bee said in some good sense to haue deserued the hire that he laboured for though it were farre greater than such a race could truly and properly merit but if this man should faile in many or any of these circumstances though he came neerer the performance of the whole than any other man did might he in iustice claime the prize as due to him vpon desert this is our case in the point of merit there is no man but he failes very much and often in his best workes some lesse some more but euery one more or lesse so that no man had any cause to accuse god of iniustice though he should denie all man the reward due to the keepers of his commandements reason ii exod and shew mercie vpon thousands in them that loue me and keepe my commaundements hence i reason thus where reward is giuen vpon mercie there is no merit but reward is giuen of mercie to them that fulfill the law therefore no merit what can we any way deserue when our full recompence must be of mercie in that text is nothing touching the reward of heauen which is now in question god doth for his louing servant sake shew mercy vnto their children or friends either in temporall things or in calling them to repentance and such like but doth neuer for one mans sake bestow the kingdome vpon another vnlesse the partie himselfe be first made worthy of it what though he doe not and yet it must needes be implied in the text if your interpretation be true for to whomsoeuer god giues true repentance which is neuer without faith to him he will certainly giue the kingdome of heauen but the reason is strong by a comparison from the lesse to the greater for if these outward fauours which god bestowes vpon them that keepe his commandements be of mercie how should heauen be of debt and this appeares further by adam if hee had stood to this day he could not by his continuall and perfect obedience haue procured a further increase of fauour at god hand but should only haue continued that happy estate in which he was first created that confirmation of his that adam by his continuall and perfect obedience could not haue procured a further increase of god fauour is both besides the purpose and most false for as well he as euery good man sithence by good vse of god giftes might day by day encrease them and that no man thinke that in paradise it should haue been otherwise s augustine saith expresly that in the felicity of paradise righteousnes preserued should haue ascended into better and adam finally and all his posterity if he had not fallen should haue been from paradise translated aliue into the kingdome of heauen this by the way it is not beside the purpose because it prooues the question thus if adams continuall and perfect obedience could not deserue increase of fauour then our interrupted and imperfect obedience cannot but his could not therefore ours cannot your answere is little to the purpose for master perkins speakes not of adams increasing his owne righteousnes but of procuring or rather deseruing a more happie estate whereof the testimonie alleaged out of austin saith nothing and surely vnlesse man will needes be wiser in this point than the scripture can make them it is not possible for them to know any such thing touching adam for the ge scripture only sets down a penalty that should ensue vpon the breach of the commandement that was giuen him and neither makes mention nor giues signification of any reward at all much lesse vpon desert reason iii scripture directly condemneth merit of workes rom the wages of sinne is death but the gift of god is eternall life through iesus christ our lord the proportion of the argument required that s paul should haue said the reward of good works is eternall life if life euerlasting could bee deserued which cannot because it is a free gift true but wee speake of good workes and not of bad which the astle calleth sinne where were the mans wits but it followeth there that eternall life is the grace or gift of god nay where was your conscience when you cauild so against your knowledge master perkins reciteth the former part of that text to shew what the proportion of the argument required namely that the wages of good workes is euerlasting life as the wages of sinne is death and thus without question would the apostle haue spoken to make his exhortation to holines of life more effectuall if euerlasting life could be deserued this is to purpose but answered yeares past by that famous father s augustine in diverse places of his most learned workes i will note one or two of them first thus here ariseth no small doubt which by god helpe i will now discusse for if eternall life be rendred vnto good workes as the holy scripture doth most clearely teach note how then can it be called grace when grace is giuen freely and not repaid for workes and so pursuing the points of the difficulty at large in the end resolueth that eternall life is most truly rendred vnto good workes as the due reward of them but because those good workes could not haue been done vnlesse god had before freely through christ bestowed his grace vpon vs therefore the same eternall life is also truly called grace because the first roote of it was god free gift the very same answere doth he giue where he hath these words eternall life is called grace not because it is not rendred vnto merits but for that those merits to which it is rendred vvere giuen s austin aug de gra amp lib arb ca in the places alleaged by you neither expounds that text nor speakes of any proportion between the desert of death by sinne and life by good workes but because i am not ignorant aug de gra amp lib arb ca de correp amp grat cap that it is his opinion that euerlasting life is due to good workes if you will giue me leaue i will salue the matter by fetching this due from the promise of god not from the dignitie of the worke which i thinke to haue been his meaning because he speakes so often and so much of the imperfection of our workes if to countenance your owne error you will needes haue austin thought to haue erred which is not impossible at the least shew some good reason why rom the holie apostle should forbeare to say euerlasting life is the wages of good works when it would so fitly haue serued his turne for exhortation and when the nature of the sentence required it chrysost amp theoph ad rom chrysostom and theophylact denie all recompence and reward of labours past and referre all to grace he doth not say that the wages of righteousnes is euerlasting life saith ca tan ad rom caietan but the gift of god is euerlasting life that we may vnderstand that we attaine to euerlasting life for our end not by our merits but of his free gift wherefore also he addes in christ iesus our lord behold the merit behold the righteousnes the reward whereof is euerlasting life but to vs it is a gift by ratione ipsius christi reason or in regard of christ iesus himselfe in which place he crosseth m perkins proportion most directly affirming that s paul might haue said truly eternall life is the pay or wages of good workes but to hold vs in humilitie pa tly and partly to put a difference betweene our saluation and damnation chose rather to say that the gift of god was life eternall because of our damnation we are the whole and only cause but not of our saluation but principally the grace of god the only fountaine of merit and all good workes the reasons you giue why the apostle would not speak as was fittest for his purpose are too weake first you say he would keepe vs in humilitie but his principall end was more to be respected which was the stirring of vs vp to holinesse of conuersation beside if it be as you teach christians are acquainted with this doctrine of meriting euerlasting life and therefore the concealing of it here was to small purpose i would your councill of trent had thought vpon this reason and then perhaps they would not haue valued the good workes of man at so high a rate the difference you speake of was put before in handling the doctrine of iustification neither could any christian be so foolishly proud as to think he could of himself do good works how then could he looke for euerlasting life simply by his owne strength again tit we are saued not by works of righteousnesse which we haue done but according to his mercie he saued vs and ephesian by grace you are saued through faith and that not of your selues it is the gift of god not of workes which god hath prepared that we should walke in them if any works be crowned it is certaine that the sufferings of martyrs shal be rewarded now of them paul saith rom the sufferings of this life are not worthie of the glorie to come where then is the value and dignitie of other workes to this purpose ambrose saith the iust man though he be tormented in the brasen bull is still iust because hee iustifieth god and saith he suffereth lesse then his sinnes deserue now to those texts cited before about iustification vve are saued freely not of our selues or by the workes of righteousnes vvhich vve haue done i haue often answered that the apostle speakes of workes done by our owne forces without the helpe of god grace and therefore they cannot serue against workes done in and by grace now to that text which he hudleth vp togither with the rest although is deserued a better place being one of their principall pillers in this controucrise it is the suffering of this life are not vvorthy of the glorie to come the strength of this obiection lyeth in a false translation of these words axia pros ten doxan equall to that glorie or in the misconstruction of them for we grant as it hath bin already declared that our afflictions and sufferings be not of equall in length or greatnesse with the glorie of heauen for our afflictions be but for the short space of this life and they cannot be so great as will be the pleasure in heauen notwithstanding we teach that this shorter and less labour imployed by a righteous man in the seruice of god doth merit the other greater and of longer continuance and that by the said apostles plaine words for saith he that tribulation vvhich in this present life is but for a moment and light doth vvorke aboue measure exceedingly an euerlasting vvaight of glorie in vs the reason is that iust mens workes islue out of the fountaine of grace which giueth a heauenly value vnto his workes againe it maketh him a quicke member of christ and so receiuing influence from his head his vvorkes are raised to an higher estimate it consecrateth him also a temple of the holy ghost and so maketh him partaker of the heauenly nature as s peter speaketh which addes a worth of heauen to his workes for the translation we haue the warrant of the syriak interpretation which is all one with ours as arias moncanus your own man expound it and theophyl ad rom theophylact in his commentarie saith not onely that they are not dignae pares equall but also that they are not worthie indeed the apostles purpose is to compare the sufferings of this life with the glorie of the life to come and to shew how wonderfully that exceeds these but yet we may also from thence conclude that because of this inequalitie there can be no proper and true merit by these f as for that you alleage of their working an euerlasting waight of glorie in vs it is to be vnderstood that this is by god bountie not the worthinesse of the person or matter which must needes be apparant to euery man that considers what infirmities accompanie the sufferings of the best of god children by being a member of christ he doth not receiue abilitie to merit but priuiledge to be partaker of his head our sauiour christs glorie neither by being the temple of god are we made able to deserue nor by pet being partaker of the diuine nature which is nothing else but to haue the spirit of god dwelling in vs by the graces of righteousnesse and holinesse which is the image of god according to which wee were at the first created for these graces being not perfect in vs bring foorth vnperfect fruites which can neuer merit truly and properly neither is that glory in heauen vvhich any pure creature attaineth vnto of infinite dignity as master perkins fableth but hath his certaine bounds and measure according vnto each mans merittes othervvise it vvould make a man equall to god in glorie for there can be no greater then infinite as all learned man do confesle you should haue shewed where master perkins saith that the glorie of any creature can be infinite as well as you reprooue him for saying so and that with such skorne as you doe master perkins knew as well as you can teach him that no finite nature is capable of any infinitnes but yet he truly denies full proportion between our present sufferings and our glorie to come which your selfe confesse to bee true reason iv whosoeuer will merit must fulfill the wholelaw but none can keepe the whole lawe for if we say we haue no sin wee deceiue our selues ioh and he that sinnes against one commandement is guiltie of the whole law and what can he merit that is guiltie of the breach of the whole law i deny the first proposition for one good worke done with his due circumstances doth bring forth merit as by all the properties of merit may be proued at large and by his owne definition of merit set downe in the beginning now if a man afterward fall into deadly sinne he leeseth his former merit but recouering grace he riseth to his former merit as the learned gather out of that saying of our sauiour in the person of the good father doe on him that is on his prodigall son returning home his former garment his second proposition is also false as j had been if your strongth had been as good as your stomacke epistle ad hieron hath bin proued at large in a seuerall question to that of s iames although it belong not to this matter i answere that he who offendeth in one is made guilty of all that is he shall be as surely condomned as if he had broken all see s augustine you denie the proposition but if you did remember that the question is of meriting euerlasting life which requires the keeping of the whole law you would neuer stick at it for iam no man can be guiltie of the whole law as euery one is that failes in any one commandement and yet deserue euerlasting life the reason of your deniall is not sufficient for no one worke done with neuer so due circumstances can bring forth any merit of euerlasting life whereof master perkins speakes in his definition indeede this reason is nothing but a bare deniall of master perkins proofe that you add of a mans losing and recouering his merit is liker a dreame then a point of diuinitie as it may well appeare by the poore proofe you bring of it viz a speech out of an allegory and that also falsly translated his former garment for that best or principall garment your vulgar editio latina vulgar latine calls it the first garment pagnin vestem primam praecipuam pagnin that principall your glossa interlin interlinear glosse expounds it to signifie the garment of the holie ghost and the glossa ordin ordinarie glosse giues a reason why it is called the first because it is the garment of innocence in which the first man was created which interpretation is taken out of de qq euangel austin but to the matter what reason is there that merit should not be recompenced according to iustice if a man haue once deserued euerlasting life why should he not haue it or if that merit be once lost how can it be restored againe but only by god acceptation and then how can it be truly and properly merit you must not only say but shew too that the place of s iames belongs not to this matter els it is an easie matter to answere any authority of scripture let vs grant your owne interpretation that he which breakes one commandement shall be certainely condemned how then can he deserue euerlasting life without keeping all the commandements and what a strange and vnsauorie doctrine is it that he which hath merited euerlasting life may be damned but the meaning of the apostle is that the seuerall commandements are as it were seuerall conditions of a couenant between god and man whereof if any one be broken the whole bond is forfeited how exactly soeuer all the rest haue bin performed what merit then can there be of life where the partie is liable to damnation reason v we are taught to pray on this manner giue vs this day our daily bread wherein we acknowledge euery morsell of bread to be the meere gift of god without desert and therefore must we much more acknowledge life eternall to be euery way the gift of god it must needs therefore be a satanicall insolencie for any man to imagine that hee can by his workes merit eternall life who cannot merit bread m perkins taketh great delight to argue out of the lord prayer but he handleth the matter so handsomely that a man may thinke him to be so profoundly learned that he doth not yet vnderstand the pater noster for who taketh our dayly food to be so meerely the gift of god that we must not either make it ours with our peny or trauaile we must not looke to be fed from heauen by miracle by the meere gift of god but according vnto s paules rule either labour for our liuing in some approued sort or not cate yet because our trauailes are in vaine vnlesse god blesse them we pray to god daily to giue vs our nuriture either by sending or preseruing the fruits of the earth or by prospering our labours with good successe or if they be man who liue of almes by stir ring vp the charitable to relieue them so we pray and much more earnestly that god will giue vs eternall life yet by such meanes as it hath pleased god to ordaine one of which and the principall is by the exercise of good workes which god hath appointed vs to walke in to deserue it and it cannot but sauour of a satanicall spirit to call it a satanicall insolencie as m perkins doth to thinke that eternall life can be merited when saint augustine and the best spirit of man since christs time so thought and taught in most expresse tearmes you take greater paines to disgrace master perkins arguments then to disproue or vnderstand them his reason lyes thus he that cannot merit bread cannot merit euerlasting life but no man can merit bread therefore no man can merit euerlasting life the proposition stands vpon the comparison of inequality from the lesse to the greater for it is a lesse matter to deserue bread then to merit euerlasting life the assumption is proued by that clause of the lord prayer wherein we beg our dayly bread which we might claime of due debt if we could deserue it in stead of answering some part of the syllogisme you tell vs that we must not looke to be fed from heauen by miracle without our owne trauell or cost which is as much to purpose as if you should say we must eate our bread when we haue it if we will be fed it is but a mockery to pray to god for it if we know we haue deserued it vnlesse perhaps we thinke him so vniust that it is well if we can get our owne of him by any meanes whatsoeuer we deny not that we are to vse the meanes both for the one and the other but that we can deserue either by vsing the meanes reason vi consent of the auncient church de interpellatione dauid vel ps yet is he one of your saints bernard those which we call our merits are the way to the kingdome and not the cause of raigning but let vs heare his last argument which is as he speaketh the consent of the auncient church and then beginneth with s bernard who liued yeares after christ he in i know not what place the quotation is so doubtfull saith those things vvhich vve call merits are the vvay to the kingdome but not the cause of raigning you that twight vs so much with ignorance and brag so much of your owne knowledge especially in the old writers should haue all these places at your fingers ends but this answere if it were true must needs be more by gesse then by cunning bernard sayes merits are the way not the cause if he had meant as you would haue him he should and would haue said that they were not the whole cause but the party or ioint cause but he denyes them altogether the nature of causes by giuing them another place to be the way to heauen i answere that merits be not the whole cause but the promise of god through christ and the grace of god freely bestowed on vs out of which our merits proceed which is bernards owne doctrine what is bernard ser in cantic bernards owne doctrine your whole answer or only the later part of it let the reader iudge these are bernards words as it is inough to merit not to presume of merit so to want merits is inough to condemnation if he speake of merits properly taken what presumption is it for a man to demand his right but because our good works which he as other auncient writers calls merits are imperfit therefore our greatest merit is to know we merit not for the later part of his sentence we graunt that it is inough to damnation for a man to be without good works it followes in bernard no infants regenerate want merits but haue christs whereof notwithstanding they make themselues vnworthie if they had opportunitie to add their owne and neglected it which is the danger of riper yeares infants sayes bernard haue christs merits but if they come to yeares they must also haue some of their owne what merits to deserue heauen then were christs insufficient but they must haue good works without which they make themselues vnworthie of any benefit by christ is not this whollie our doctrine let vs heare his conclusion haue a care sayes bernard to haue merits hauing them know they were giuen thee hope for the fruite of them by the mercy of god and thou hast auoided all danger of pouertie vnthankefulnes and presumption we must haue good workes else wee are poore we must know they are not of our selues else we are vnthankfull we must looke for reward of mercie not of debt else we are presumptuous so that bernard requires good workes not as the cause but as the way between god promise and performance of giuing euerlasting life to them that are iustified and sanctified august manual cap all my hope is in the death of my lord his death is my meritmy merit is the passion of the lord i shall not be voide of merits so long as god mercies are not wanting secondly he citeth saint augustine all my hope is in the death of my lord his death is my merit true in a good sense that is by the vertue of his death and passion my sinnes are pardoned and grace is bestowed on me to doe good workes and so to merit you leaue out the better halfe of that which was alleaged out of austin which indeede ouerthrowes your answere that christ hath procured pardon and grace for you to merit by but austin saith that the death and passion of the lord are his merit that is by your interpretation his merit of grace not of glorie for that he must merit by well vsing the grace which christ hath deserued for him to cut off this austin addes aug manual cap i shall not be voide of merits so long as god mercies are not wanting haue those works the true and whole nature of merit which receiue their worth from god mercie if you will answere that by god mercie he meanes not his accepting of the worke but his supplying vs with grace to worke i replie that he may for all that mercie want merits because it depends vpon his own free will when god hath done his vttermost whether hee will worke or no but that which followes in austin shewes that all is in god mercie if saith he the mercies of the lord be many i am much in merit the mightier he is to saue the more am i secure so that austin takes all from himselfe and giues it to god basil on psalm eternall rest is reserued for them which haue striuen lawfully in this life not for the merits of their doings but vpon the grace of the most bountifull god in which they trusted these words are vntruly translated for first he maketh with the apostle eternall life to be the prize of that combate and then addeth that it is not giuen according vnto the debt and iust rate of the works but in a fuller measure according vnto the bounty of so liberall a lord where hence is gathered that common and most true sentence that god punisheth man vnder their deserts but rewardeth them aboue their merits wherein lies the error of the translation you take too much vpon you as if all the world were bound to allow your word without any further proofe but let vs examine the translation eternall rest saith basil manetillos is reserued for them who in this life haue striuen lawfully not as debitum operibus reddi m a debt paid them for their worke but giuen them vpon the most bountifull grace of god in whom they haue hoped he is desirous to picke quarrels that findes fault with such translations what one word hath master perkins left out or misinterpreted that might be any thing to your aduantage but the testimonie was too plaine to admit any cauill else the translation had been good enough but your proofe is at least as bad as your accusation to prooue the words are vntruly translated you tell vs that basil makes eternall life the prize of the combat what is this to the purpose where is the fault of the translation but let vs take your interpretation of his meaning if the reward be not giuen according to debt but in a fuller measure and yet no greater thing giuen than euerlasting life doubtlesse our workes deserue not truly and wholy the reward of euerlasting life that god bestowes on them of bountie august on psalm he crowneth thee because he crowneth his owne gifts not thy merits s augustine was to wise to let any such foolish sentence passe his penne what congruity is in this he crowneth thee because he crowneth his ovvne gifts not thy merits it had been better said he crowneth thee not ampc it may be apparant to all man who consider this mans course in answering the testimonies of the fathers that he doth it by rote and not by skill not caring what their meaning was but gessing what in his conceit it might be if he had lookt for the place here alleaged he would certainly haue answered that austin hath no such speech vpon that psalme and then perhaps he might with more reason haue denied that he hath it at all the truth is the printer misplaced the cypher and of psalme made but master perkins truly alleaged austins words and sentence which this bold censurer calles foolish and confidently affirmes that austin would not let any such foolish sentence passe his penne let himselfe iudge whether austin say so or no we saith aug in psalm austin that are ouercome in our selues haue ouercome in him therefore he crownes thee because quia dona sua coronat he crownes his owne gifts not thy merits the sense is that if god should looke to our actions of striuing against sinne as they are weakly performed by vs hee would neuer crowne them but considering that wee striue by his grace he vouchsafes them a reward though on our part altogether vndeserued but he mistooke belike this sentence of saint augustine vvhen god crovvneth thee he crovvneth his gifts not thy merits which is true being taken in that sense which he himselfe declareth to such a man so thinking that is that he hath merits of himselfe without the grace of god it may be most truly said god doth crovvne his ovvne gifts not thy merits if thy merits be of thy selfe and not from him but if we acknowledge our merits to proceed from grace working vvith vs then may vve as truly say that eternall life is the crowne and revvard of merits austin hath the same sentence for the substance of it in aug in psalm amp epistola amp de gra amp lib arb ca many other places and namely in that you alleage though not altogether as you alleage it for after those words if thy merits be of thy selfe it followes in de grat amp lib arb cap austin for these if they be such are naught those that are naught god crownes not but if they be good they be the gifts of god the rest and the greater halfe of the sentence is none of austins but yours yet closely conueied by you as if it were his no lesse than the former and psalm lord thou wilt quicken me in thy iustice not in mine not because i haue deserued it but because thou hast compassion his other place on the psalme is not to this purpose but appertaines to the first iustification of a sinner as the first word quicken and reuiue me sheweth plainely now we confesse that a sinner is called to repentance and reuiued not for any desert of his owne but of god meere mercie it will not serue the turne to say it is not to this purpose but speakes of the first iustification of a sinner for dauid who is held to be the penner of it was truly iustified before the writing of that psalme yes the whole course of the psalme it selfe manifestly prooues that it was the prayer of one greatly in god fauour and strongly perswaded of his succour but what neede i seeke any proofes haue you forgotten that a few lines before you confest as much when as you would haue shifted off that place in the second verse of this psalme by answering that the prophet prayed onely for veniall and light sinnes how then is the case so suddenly altred forsooth because he saith thou shalt quicken me for so indeed he saith and not quicken me as you write but this quickning is not giuing him grace to iustification but comforting and relieuing him in the troubles hee speakes of and as lyra ad psalm lyra truly expounds it deliuering him from the daunger of death which hung ouer his head by reason of his son absoloms vnnaturall rebellion obiect i in sundrie places of scripture promise of reward is made to them that beleeue and do good workes therefore our workes doe merit for a reward and merit be relatiues answer reward is twofold of debt and of mercie life euerlasting is not a reward of debt but of mercie giuen of the good will of god without anything done of man hauing thus at length answered vnto all that m perkins hath alleaged against merittes let vs see what can be said for them following as neere as i can m perkins order first in sundry places of scripture promise of reward is made vnto good workes if thou doe vvell shalt thou not receiue to him that doth vvell there is a faithfull revvard feare not to be iustified vnto death because the revvard of god remaineth for euer and vvhen you are reuiled and persecuted for my sake reioyce for great is your reward in heauen and a hundred such like therefore such workes doe merit heauen for a reward supposeth that there was a desert of it m perkins answereth first that the reward is of meere mercie without any thing done by man but this is most apparantly false for the scripture expresseth the very workes whereof it is a reward againe a reward in english supposeth a former pleasure which is rewarded otherwise it were to be called a gift and not a reward and much more the latin and greek word misthos merces which rather signifie a mans hire and wages then a gift or reward m perkins saith not that reward is promised to workes but to them that beleeue and doe good workes where if there be any desert it is wholy in the person if not onely yes all the places you needlesly alleage mention reward to the doer not to the deed to the former part of the place out of ecclesiastic ecclesiasticus i answered before i adde now concerning the latter which belongs to this argument viz because the reward of god remaines for euer that it is not in the greeke copie caraffa pagnin greeke copie nor in caraffas latin nor in pagnines vatablus vatablus hath it indeede but within two hookes as a sentence suspected the edition of complutum and a as montanus wholy omit it there is nothing done by man that can deserue such a reward though there be something done for which the doer is rewarded a reward supposeth some action which is rewarded but not alwaies vpon desert it may well be called a reward because it is giuen in respect of the worke howsoeuer not for the worth of it the greeke merces and the latin merces signifie a reward for somewhat done either vpon couenant or otherwise but prooue not any merit in the worke secondly the kingdome of heauen is properly an inheritance giuen of a father to a child and therefore it is called a reward not properly but by a figure or by resemblance for as a workeman hauing ended his labour receiueth his wages so after man haue lead their liues and finished their course in keeping faith and good conscience as dutifull children god giueth them eternall life and hereupon it is termed a reward wherefore m perkins skippes to a second shift that forsooth eternall life is an inheritance but not a reward reply we know well that it is an inheritance because it is only due vnto the adopted sonnes of god but that hindereth not it to be a reward for that it is our heauenly fathers pleasure that all his son comming to the yeares of discretion shall by their good carriage either deserue it or else for their bad behauiour be disinherited an inheritance is not due to the son onely because none except hee bee a son can haue it but is his proper right because he is a son and therfore it is vnreasonable both in diuinitie and law that the son should be bound to purchase that by his labour to which by a naturall right he hath full interest this is our case for though we are not sonnes by nature but gal rom by adoption yet being sonnes and heires yes ioynt heires with christ the naturall son of whose bodie we are members the very nature of our sonneship or being sonnes conueies vnto vs a sufficient and certaine title to the inheritance it is indeed the pleasure of god our father that we should labour to expresse our thankfulnes by all holy obedience to him that hath adopted vs for his children and that we after this labour should receiue the inheritance not deserue that by our labour to which wee haue alreadie a farre better claime by being sonnes thirdly if i should graunt that life euerlasting is a deserued reward it is not for our workes but for christs merit imputed to vs causing vs thereby to merit and thus the relation stands directly between the reward and christs merit applied vnto vs m perkins hauing so good reason to distrust his two former answeres flies to a third and graunteth that eternal life is a reward yet not of our workes but of christs merits imputed vnto vs this is that castle wherin he holds himselfe safe from all canon shotte but he is fouly abused for this answere is the most extrauagant of all the rest as being furthest off from the true sense of the scripture examine any one of the places and a babe may discouer the incongruity of it namely christ saith that great is their reward who are reuiled and persecuted for his sake assigning the reward vnto their constant bearing and enduring of tribulation for god sake and not to his owne merits imputed and if you desire a formall sentence fitting this purpose take this euery man shall receiue his reward according vnto his ovvne proper labour and not according to christs merits imputed vnto him so a doer of the vvorke shall be blessed in his deed and not in the imputation of anothers deed master perkins did not nor needed mistrust either of his former answers but because he knew that diverse man were moued with diverse reasons he added this third to see if by god blessing this might giue satisfaction where the other were not fully vnderstood it is not master perkins meaning to say that in these our works there is desert by christs merit imputed but that if the children of god must needes be thought to receiue euerlasting life as of merit the merit is properly christs imputed to them obiect ii christ by his death merited that our workes should merit life euerlasting answer that is false all we find in scripture is that christ by his merit procured pardon of sinne imputation of righteousnesse and life euerlasting and it is no where said in the word of god that christ did merit that our workes should merit it is a dotage of their owne deuising he died not for our good workes to make them able to satisfie god anger but for our sinnes that they might be pardoned thus much saith the scripture and no more and in that christ did sufficiently merit life eternall for vs by his owne death it is a sufficient proofe that hee neuer intended to giue vs power of meriting the same vnlesse wee suppose that at some time hee giues more then is needefull againe christ in the office of mediation as he is a king priest and prophet admitteth no deputy or fellow for he is a most perfect mediatour doing all thinges by himselfe without the helpe of any and the ministers that dispence the word are not his deputies but reasonable and voluntarie instruments which he vseth but if man by workes can merit increase of grace and happinesse for themselues then hath christ partners in the worke of redemption man doing that by him which hee doth of himselfe in procuring their saluation nay if this might stand that christ did merit that our workes should merit then christ should merit that our stained righteousnesse beeing for this cause not capable of merit should neuerthelesse merit i call it stained because we are partly flesh and partly spirit and therfore in our selues deseruing the curse of the law though wee bee regenerate againe for one good worke wee doe wee haue many euill the offence whereof defaceth the merit of our best deedes and makes them too light in the ballance of the law insteed of our second reason blindly proposed by m perkins i vvill confirme the first with such texts of holy writ as specifie plainly your good workes to be the cause of eternall life the second reason is so cleerely set downe that me thinkes you dare not looke vpon it for feare of hauing your eyes dazled by the brightnes of it a sillie shift to auoid an argument which you cannot answere come vnto me yee blessed of my father possesse a kingdome prepared for you and why so for vvhen i vvas hungry yee gaue me meate and so foorth the like is in the same chapter of the servant who imployed well their talents for their lord said vnto them because you haue been faithfull in fevv things i vvill place you ouer many and many such like where good workes done by the parties themselues are expresly saide to be the very cause why god rewardeth them with the kingdome of heauen thorefore he must needs be holden for a very vvrangler that doth seeke to peruert such euident speeches and vvould make the simple beleeue that the cause there formally specified is not to be taken for the cause but doth only signifie an order of things the places you bring to prooue that good workes are the cause of eternall life proue not that the things that were done did truly and wholy deserue such a reward which is the question no more doth august in psalm austins exposition wee are iudged according to our workes so that if any man should wonder why these are receiued into heauen those cast into hell rather than those into heauen these into hell our sauiour tels them that hee doth not erre in the difference hee makes which must be according to workes these haue done well and therefore are they that must be saued those euill and therefore are the man that must be condemned so that his iudgement is right because it is according to works though workes bee not the meritorious cause of life trulie and wholie but if any desire besides the euidence of the text to see how the auncient fathers take it let him read s augustine where he thus briefly handleth this text come yee blessed of my father receiue vvhat shall vve receiue a kingdome for vvhat cause because i vvas hungrie and you gaue me meate ampc of the reall imputation of christs merits there vvas no tydings in those daies and that iudicious doctor found that good vvorkes vvas the cause of receiuing the kingdome of heauen in this and such like sentences of the fathers we must remember that obseruation of sixtus senens biblioth sanct lib annot sixtus senensis a learned papist and not presse their words to the vttermost it followes in austin immediatly what is so tam vile little worth what so earthly as to breake bread to the hungry tanti valet regnum coelorum that is the price of the kingdome of heauen now will any man be so absurd as to imagin that austin thought that the giuing of a peece of bread to a poore body was in deede the price of heauen by which it might be truly and wholie bought if it be of no greater value it was scarse worth the purchasing with the blood of the son of god the reuerend father rhetorically amplifies the point to inforce his exhortatio to works of charity which is also our sauiours reason in that parable now that the reward we receiue is not truly and wholie deserued by the works there mentioned it may appeare because chrysost amp theophyl ad illum locum matth chrysostom and theophylact stand so precisely vpon the manner of speach he saith not take it say they but possesse it as an inheritance whereas you say it is both an inheritance and a reward besides opus imperfect in matth homil apud chrysostom another saith that god did not make the kingdome of heauen of no greater value then mans righteousnes could deserue and after not according to the narrownes of mans righteousnes and lastly god saith he appointed not the reward of the saincts according to the reward of man but according to his owne bountie here by the vvay m perkins redoubleth that common slaunder of theirs that vve take avvay a part of christs mediation for saith he if christs merits vvere sufficient vvhat need ours it hath been often told them but they vvil neuer learne to vnderstand it i vvil yet once againe repeate it we hold our sauiours merits to be of infinite value and to haue deserued of god all the graces and blessings vvhich hath or shall be bestovved vpon all man from the beginning of the vvorld vnto the end of it yet his diuine vvill and order is that all man of diseretion hauing freely receiued grace from him doe merit that crovvne of glorie vvhich is prepared for them not to supply the vvant of his merits which are inestimable but being members of his mystical body he vvould haue vs also like vnto himselfe in this point of meriting and further desirous to traine vs vp in all good vvorkes he best knevv that there could be no better spurre to pricke our dull nature forvvard then to ordaine and propose such heauenly revvards vnto all them that vvould diligently endeuour to deserue them master perkins truly chargeth you to make your selues partners with christ in the worke of your saluation for he that is by his owne works a deseruer of euerlasting life is in some part at least a sauiour of himselfe so that howsoeuer you magnifie in words the infinitnes of christs satisfaction and merits yet in truth you make it either not sufficient or not effectuall to the sauing of them who must by their works truly and wholie merit euerlasting life and receiue it not as ioint heirs with christ by the right of sonnes but as hirelings for wages due to their works if you would graunt vs an assured interest to heauen by vertue of our being sonnes and claime no more of god but increase of glorie vpon his promise according to our works without pleading desert you and we should agree in this point neither should we be driuen either to ouer valew our owne righteousnes by thinking it deserues heauen or to despaire altogether of saluation because we cannot do such works as do truly and fully merit heauen that god would haue vs like vnto his son in true obedience and patient suffering we finde in the philipp rom scriptures and beleeue that we should also be like him in meriting when you prooue by the same authoritie we will beleeue in the meane while giue vs leaue rather to rest vpon christ only and his merits the sufficiencie whereof we certainely know then to trust to our owne deserts which when they are at the best seeme to vs worthie of damnation rather then reward which notwithstanding we assuredly looke for vpon god promise and acceptation not vpon our desert or perfection which comes alwayes short of that which is inioyned vs but it is god purpose to traine vs vp in good works it is so out of question ephesian for we are his workemanship created in christ iesus vnto good works which god hath ordained that we should walke in them and is there no sufficient meanes thinke you to prick vs forward to do good works vnlesse we may perswade ourselues we shal merit heauen by them see the difference between children and servant and yet forsooth you would beare the world in hand that you do all of pure loue to god whereas indeed you would do nothing at all but that your pride is satisfied for the present by the perswasion of the good vse of your free will and your hope fed with opinion of euerlasting life to be paid you hereafter as the deserued hire of your worthie works we on the other side rom being led with the affection of children rom pricked on with the feeling of god incomprehensible mercie corinthian incouraged by his gratious promises of accepting our poore indeuours to do him seruice rom rauisht with the expectatio of such a reward as is assured vs though without desert psalm matth ashamed in our selues euery day of our vnkindnes and vnthankfulnes in doing no more psalm amp daniel yes condemned in our owne hearts for doing our best works so vnperfitly yet by the blessing of god and assistance of his spirit presse forwards to the reward that is prepared for vs through the way of good works which our father hath set vs in i haue bin caryed on in this course farther then i purposed let euery man that hath a true desire to glorifie god more than himselfe iudge between vs and you out of the sinceritie of his heart whether our doctrine or yours be more to god glory the man seemes to be much ignorant in the matter of christs mediation i vvill therefore helpe him a little it consisteth in reconciling man to god vvhich he performed by paying the ransome of our sinnes in purchasing vs god fauour and in ordaining meanes hovv all mankind might attaine to eternall life in the tvvo first points vve do for the most part agree to vvit that oursinnes are freely pardoned through christs passion and that vve are as freely iustified and receiued first into god grace and fauour although vve require other preparation then they doe yet vve as fully deny any merit of ours to be cause of either as they doe marry about the meanes of attaining to heauen vve differ altogether for they say that god requires no iustice in vs nor merit at all on our parts but only the disposition of faith to lay hold on christs righteousnes and merittes but vvesay that christs righteousnes and merit are incommunicable vnto any meere creature but that through his merits god doth povvre into euery true christian a particular iustice vvhereby he is sanctified and made able to doe good vvorks and to merit eternall life which ability vve receiuing of god free gift through christ merits doth much more magnifie both god grace and christs merits for the greater that the gift is the greater is the glorie of the giuer and to argue that to be a derogation vnto his mediation and merits vvhich hee hath appointed to bee the very instrument of applying the vertue of them to vs is indeed vnder colour of magnifying christs merits to vndermine and blovv out all the vertue of them though you denie all merit in the first iustification yet you make euery mans free will the cause that hee particularly is iustified and so make him more beholding to himselfe then to god because he hath from god that he may be saued if he wil from himself that he wils and so is saued it is a greater gift to vouchsafe vs euerlasting life without our desert then to make vs able to deserue it and more for god glory that we should haue it of his free gift then of our deseruing by his gift since the abilitie only to vse the gift well is from him but the vsing of it from our owne free will as before but saies m perkins vvhat should vve talke of our merittes vvho for one good vvorke vve doe commit many bad vvhich deface our merits if vve had any true it is as it was once before said that euery mortall sinne blotteth out all former iustice and merit but by repentance both are recouered againe but must we not speake of any good because we may happe to doe euill that is a faire perswasion and well vvorthy a wise man of this iest whereby merit is made to rise and fall i spake a little before and shewed how vniust amp impossible it was you may speake of and do what good you will but not pleade desert because you haue so many sinnes to condemne you obiect iii our workes merit by bargaine or couenant because god hath promised to rewarde them ans the worde of god sets downe two couenants on legall the other euangelicall in the legall couenant life euerlasting is promised to works for that is the condition of the law do these things and thou shalt liue but on this manner can no man merit life euerlasting because none is able to doe all that the law requires whether we respect the manner or the measure of obedience in the euangelicall couenant the promises that are made are not made to any worke of vertue in man but to the worker not for any merit of his owne person or worke but for the person and merit of christ for example it is a promise of the gospell be faithfull vnto death and i will giue thee the crowne of life reuelat here the promise is not made to the vertue of fidelitie but to the faithfull person whose fidelitie is but a token that he is in christ for the merit of whose obedience god promiseth the crowne of life let vs come to our third argument god hath by couenant and promise bound himselfe to reward our workes with life euerlasting therefore good workes do in iustice deserue it for faithfull promise maketh due debt the couenant is plainly set downe where god in the person of an housholder agreeth with his workmen for a peny a day that is to giue them life euerlasting for trauailing in his seruice during their life time as all auncient interpretours expound it the antecedent being granted that god hath promist to reward our works your prouing that might haue bin spared especiallie being such as it is fetched from a parable not expounded any where in the scripture yes the fathers themselues haue obserued something in the parable as that of their murmuring who had wrought all day which will not be handsomely expounded of the reward giuen in heauen as any man may perceiue by the diverse expositions that are vsed to help the matter by chrysost gregor hieron hilar glossa ordin apud thom in caten ad matth chrysostom gregory ierome hillary and the author of your ordinarie glosse therefore lyra ad matth lyra doubts not to say plainely that the literall sense is that in the beginning of the church the iewes that were conuerted murmured because the gentiles obtained like fauour to them which he prooues out of the act acts and indeed that seemes to haue bin the end of the parable to shew the matth amp reiection of the iewes who were the first and the receiuing of the gentiles who were the last to which purpose hieron ad matth ierome saith that the iewes which were the head shall be turned to the taile and the gentiles who were the taile shall be changed to the head and for the penny he seemes to expound that of grace rather then glory a penny saith he hath the figure of the king thou hast therefore receiued the reward i promised that is my image and likenes which was also cyprian epistle ad magnum heb thes lib cont iouin c cyprians opinion as it appeares in his epistle to magnus whereupon s paul inferreth that god should be vniust if he should forget their workes who suffered persecution for him and saith if it be iust with god to render tribulation to them that persecute you and to such as are persecuted rest with vs vpon the same ground s hierome saith great truly were the iniustice of god if he did only punish ll works and vvould not as well receiue good workes to all th se and much more such like m perkins answereth that couenant for workes was in the old testament but in the new the couenant is made with the workman not with the worke reply all that i cited in this argument is out of the new testament where expresse couenant is made for working and workes as you haue heard and as it was said in the old law doe these things and thou shalt liue so is it said in the new if thou vvill enter into life keepe the commaundements and life eternall is the hire and wages for labouring in god vineyard and not of the imputed iustice or merits of christ vpon what doth heb s paul inferre that not vpon that parable and much lesse vpon the expositions of it which then were not hatcht but vpon the promises of god made to them which through faith and patience attaine to the inheritance of those promises and this is that iustice the thes apostle speaks of hauing no ground but god gratious promise to accept and reward our workes though their worth deserue no such recompence which chrysost ad matth chrysostom signifieth in his commentarie vpon the other place where he saith the reward shall be greater than the worke not onely in continuance whereof also he speaketh but in the measure too he ioynes them saith chrysostom in respect of their crownes with those who haue done farre greater things than they so that euerlasting life is not truly and properly deserued by works but is giuen by promise to them that doe worke if you will vrge the point of iustice i answere the apostle speaketh according to the common speech of man who count it a matter of iniustice not to doe well to them that doe well and ill to them that doe ill and in this generall respect god indeede deales iustly punishing them that haue behaued themselues lewdly and wickedly and rewarding them that haue liued righteously and vertuously so that herein stands his iustice in giuing euery man according to his own works without the following of which course there cannot be ordinarily any iustice and therefore hieron cont iouin lib c ierome truly saith that god doth both punish euill workes and receiue or accept of good workes but not as if there were an equalitie of merit in either sort of workes to the punishment or reward he giues onely as he saith there because he would haue none that are fallen despaire of god mercie he thus amplifies his regard of them as though it were an vniust thing for god as chrysostom speakes to contemne and forget them that haue exercised themselues in workes of charitie you haue brought no place of any expresse couenant but that which being allegoricall and as i said before not expounded in the scripture can hardly affoord any certain proofe and none at all of the matter for which you bring it whereas if the point were so cleere as you would make it being of so great importance doubtlesse it would haue more direct confirmation in scripture than by allegories and exhortations but it seemes you doe not rightly vnderstand master perkins distinction who denies not that a reward is promised for working and workes euen in the new couenant but makes this difference that by the couenant of the law the wages is due to him that workes vpon the value of his worke but by the couenant of the gospell the reward is giuen not for the worth of the deede but because the worke is accepted for the workmans sake who by faith is the son of god neither of those speeches are any part of the new couenant though they be recorded in the new testament and the matth latter was our sauiours own speech to beate down the pride of him that would be iustified by the law but of this before the parable is often vrged but nothing prooued out of it he that will haue euerlasting life as hire of his trauaile proclaimeth himselfe to be a hireling not a son and therefore christ saith further i come quickly and will giue to euery man according to his workes marke hee saith not to the worke or for the worke but to the worker according to his workes and thus the bond of all other promises of the gospell in which god willingly binds himselfe to reward our workes doe not directly concerne vs but haue respect to the person and obedience of christ for whose sake alone god binds himselfe as debter vnto vs and giues the recompence or rewarde according to the measure of our faith testified by our workes and therefore it cannot be truely gathered that workes do merit by any promise or couenant passed on god part to man but looke about you and behold the goodly marke which m perkins sets vp marke saith he that it is said god will render vnto euery man according to his workes not to the worke or for the worke o sharpe and ouer fine witte doth he render according to the workes and doth he not render for the workes if the rate of the workes be the measure of the revvard that for fevver or less vvorkes there is a less revvard and for many and vvorthier a greater surely in my simple vnderstanding he that giueth according vnto the vvorks giueth for the vvorks we denie not that the reward is to and for the worke but that the value of the worke deserues it which worth being wanting the reward is bestowed vpon the partie according to his worke not for the desert of it in another sense it is all one to say according to the worke or for the worke as in generall he rewards them that doe well because they doe well and he punisheth them that doe ill because they doe ill and so giues to both according or for their workes some may say if workes merit not why are they mentioned in the promises i answere not because they merit but because they are tokens that the doer of the worke is in christ for whose merit the promise shall be accomplished that other addle inuention that vvorkes are there mentioned not because they are revvarded but because they are tokens that the doer is in christ for vvhose obedience god promiseth the crovvne of life is not vvorth the confuting it is so flat contrarie to the text vvhich ascribeth distinctly that revvard vnto the vvorkman for his vvorkes and not for christs obedience imputed vnto him what text meane you sure neither of both those to which master perkins answers hath any such direct ascribing of the reward to the workman for his works but it is the latter i thinke you speake of which you haue laboured to confute what is there in that but that christ wil giue to euery man according to his worke that is as revelation the verse next before shewes to punish the vniust and filthie and to reward the righteous and holie obiect iv good works are perfect and without fault for they are the workes of the holy ghost who cannot sinne therefore they merit ans if workes did proceede onely and immediately from the holy ghost there could not be any fault in them but our works come from the holy ghost in and by the will and vnderstanding of man and by this meanes they are tainted with sinne as water in the fountaine is both cleare and sweete yet the streames thereof passing through the filthie channell are defiled thereby againe they reason thus that which we are bound to doe hath no fault in it but we are bound to doe good workes therefore they are perfect answer the proposition must be expounded that which we are bound to doe in it selfe according to the intention of the commander hath no fault or that which we are bound to doe according as we are bound to doe it hath no fault yet in regard of the intention of the doer or in regard of our manner of doing it may bee faultie m perkins fourth obiection for vs is proposed vnskilfully yet could he not ansvvere it but by relying vpon that vvhich is most vntrue that forsooth no one action of the best man is vvithout fault vvhith hath bin alreadie confuted and might be by instances of abrahams oblation of his son s john baptists preaching and reprehending of herode stephens martyrdome vvith infinite such like in vvhich m perkins nor any else vvill be able to shevv in particular vvhat fault there vvas will this shifting neuer be left what want of skill finde you in propounding the obiection if you could haue told we should haue been sure to heare of it well let reasonable man iudge there lackes only the proposition which any man may supplie and the assumption wherein the doubt lies is prooued by a further reason what meanes this yet as if he had propounded it vnskilfully that he might answere it the easier is not his answere plaine and direct to the proofe of the assumption in which the strength of the argument consists but you say his answere hath been alreadie confuted i replie that the confutation hath been alreadie answered and to the instances you now bring i adde further that howsoeuer wee cannot alleage any particular faults in the worthie actions of some extraordinarie man yet we intreat you to remember that they were man hauing gal rom the flesh in them lusting against the spirit naturall corruption not wholy abolished to taint their workes and hieron epistle ad ctesiph cont pelag matth luke that god can see an error or want where man thinke the thing cannot be bettered againe our sauiour saith that if the eye be simple the vvhole body is lightsome not hauing any part of darknes in it and very reason teacheth vs that a mans action for substance and all due circumstances may be perfect i would faine heare what you would conclude vpon that matth luke place of the eyes simplenes if by the eye you vnderstand the heart and thinke to proue that mens actions are good because the heart is good either your consequence of the proposition is naught if by heart you meane intent for a good intent makes not by and by a good worke or else your assumption will be false imagining such a measure of purenes in the heart as is not in this life to be found your glossa ordin ad matth glosse vpon the place referres it to the intention but argues not from thence any perfection if thou do good works with as pure intention as thou are able they are the works of light though it seeme not so to the world and glossa interlin ibid another glosse saith that by the intent works are discerned whether they be works of light or of darkenes not as you say whether they be perfit or vnperfit a third i yes ibid glosse restraines it more saying it is a metaphoricall speach as if he should haue said as thy bodily eye directs thy bodily actions so the eye of the mind by a right intention directs humane actions in quantum inest ratio boni moralis as farre as concernes the nature of morall goodnes if the intent of the mind be right the whole heape of thy actions shall be good and belie so that the worke be lawful in genere for the kind of it i will adde no more let all man iudge what truth there is like to be in that doctrine that can find no better warrant of scripture it vvas then a very seely shift to say that neuer any man did any one action vvith all his due circumstances whose shift is this sure not master perkins in this answere but why is it a shift because you say that reason teacheth vs that a mans actions for substance and all due circumstances may be perfit i dare not take it for true vpon your word in morall actions according to the light of nature and if it were true in them i should not be resolued that therefore it were also true in them according to the law of god but insteed of that fourth argument i vvill put this if a greater revvard be due vnto them that do better workes then a reward is due vnthem that do good workes vvhici is euident in reason but a greatot revvard is prouided for them that doe better he that considers this reason of yours would thinke there was small cause why you should condemne master perkins for want of skill in propounding the last argument for you to mend the matter first bring vs out a false syllogisme and then conclude that which we denie not your syllogisme is false because the assumption is not taken out of the proposition as it should be but is a new matter as it were a fourth terme brought in for your assumption should be but a greater reward is due in steed whereof you say a greater is prouided now to be prouided and to be due is not all one because many things are prouided for meere gifts whch are no way due your conclusion must be therefore a reward is due to them which do good works who saith otherwise but this due is of promise not of desert as s augustine grounded vpon god vvord proueth in sundry places nam ly vpon that for starre dissereth from starre in glory so shall be the resurrection from the dead specifying that virginity shall shine after one sort chastity in vvedlocke after another and holy vviddovvhood yet after another all saith he shall be there but they shine diuersly and of the same vvorke affirmeth that martyrdome shall be higher revvarded then any other vvorke the like doth he vpon those vvords one ground shall yeeld thirty fold another threescore folde another an hundred folde comparing chastity in vvedlocke to the thirtie in vviddovves to the sixtie and in virgin to the hundred but most directly in his sixtie seauen treatise vpon s iohns gospell vpon this verse jn my fathers house are many mansions vvhere he saith that albeit some be holier iuster and more valiant then others yet there shall be fit roomes for them all vvhere euery one is to receiue his place according vnto his merit that peny spoken of by vvhich saith he is signified eternall life shall be giuen to euery man equally because euery one shall liue for euer and not one longer then another but many mansions do signifie the different dignities of merits in the same euerlasting life and saint gregorie in most expresse tearmes doth teach the same doctrine saying because in this life there is a difference of vvorkes amongst vs there shall be in the other life vvithout all doubt a distinction of dignities that as one here exceedeth another in merit so there one surpasseth another i revvard finally s augustine and s hierome condemne it as an heresie to hold that there is not diuersitie of merits in this life and revvards in the next whereon follovveth most manifestly that there be merits and revvards al this labour of heaping vp needlesse testimonies might well haue been spared especially since they proue not that which you should haue assumed that greater reward is due but that which you did assume that greater reward is prouided wherefore letting passe the three former which are nothing to the purpose to the aug n ioh tract last i answere that by merits good works are meant as by meriting working not that which is truly and properly desert beside it is expresly set downe in that testimony out of gregory wherein that which is termed worke in the former part of the sentence in the latter is called merit the same answere i make to the other two testimonies of austin and ierome granting a diuersitie of reward according to the diverse dignitie and number of good workes obict v christ saith revelation that the faithfull in the church of sardis shall walke with him in white for they are worthie therefore beleeuers merit answer euery beleeuer is worthie to walke with christ yet not worthie in himselfe but in christ to whom he is vnited and made bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh and by reason of this coniunction it is that man are said to be worthie because they are inriched with christs merits and righteousnesse the fift reason is taken out of those texts vvhich reach that man are vvorthy of eternall life they shall walke with me in whites because they be vvorthy god proued them and found them vvorthy of himselfe that you may be esteemed vvorthie of the kingdome of god novv if man be vvorthy of eternall life it must needs be graunted that they haue deserued it i denie the consequence of the proposition first because infants at the least in your doctrine are worthie of euerlasting life and yet it were hard to say they haue deserued it secondly in that we are the sonnes of god we haue a certaine worthinesse of our inheritance yet haue we not truly and wholy deserued euerlasting life thirdly there is also a worthinesse in god acceptation whereof the apostle speakes thes that you may be esteemed worthie and our sauiour luke they that shall be esteemed worthie fourthly they that are iustified shall haue a speciall worthinesse in themselues when they come to receiue their inheritance because they shall be truly and fully sanctified m perkins answereth that they were indeed worthy but not for their owne merits but for christs imputed vnto them this is his only refuge yet hath he not nor cannot shew any one text in scripture that speaketh so master perkins rightly vnderstanding the question that it is of such a worthinesse as truly and fully deserues euerlasting life for wages denies that they of sardis were in that sort worthie of heauen by any other thing than by being members of christs mysticall bodie and so partakers of his worthinesse in their measure which master perkins proues though he name not the place by shewing that ephesian we are bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh receiuing corinthian as our resurrection so euerlasting life by and with him our head but to refell him turne only to the places and there you shall finde that this worthinesse rose of good workes as christ saith i knovv thy vvorkes and find them not full yet there be some amongst yo vvho aue not defiled their garments but haue their workes full they shall vvalke vvith me in whites because they be vvorthy that this worthinesse is not such as the councill of trent speakes of that truly and wholy deserues heauen as wages it may easily appeare because the revelation holie ghost giues this commendation rather for refraining from those sinnes whereof the sardians generally were guiltie than for any principall workes of obedience now whereas you adde but haue their workes full it is without authoritie from the text though it be in the second verse yes the change of the phrase in this verse may cause vs to think that by that want in the former verse some actuall transgressions are signified by which their garments were defiled as the holie ghost here speakes so that this worthinesse was by christs acceptation and in comparison of the rest of the sardians and by susteining persecutions they vvere made vvorthy of that kingdome and in the words following the apostle signifieth that it is as iust for god to requite good workes with the ioyes of heauen as he doth punish wicked with the paines of hell that which i said of the sardians is euident as i shewed before of the thes verse thessalonians who were esteemed worthie for their workes yet not precisely for the value of them being such as they were bound to doe and could not without sinne leaue vndone the iustice of god which you vrge out of the apostle prooues nothing but this that in iustice the persecutors are to be punished and the persecuted relieued but it doth not prooue an equalitie of desert on each side because to suffer for christ if occasion be is a dutie and many imperfections ouertake the best in suffering and ouerthrow all true merit obiect vi tim euerlasting life is termed a crowne and a crowne of righteousnes to be giuen of a iust iudge therfore ma for his part by his works deserues the same answer euerlasting life is called a crowne onely in resemblance for as hee which runneth a race must continue and runne to the ende and then be crowned euen so must we continue to walke in good workes vnto the end and then receiue eternall life the sixt reason m perkins deliuereth thus eternall life is tearmed a crowne and a crowne of righteousnes to be giuen by a iust iudge therfore in this life it must be iustly deserued otherwise it were not well called a crowne of iustice nor could be saide to be rendred by a iust iudge it should seeme you like the deliuering of it well enough or else it is to be presumed you would haue mended it or blamed it whereof you make a shew by your preface to it the proofe of the consequence which you adde will be discust in your answers m perkins answereth that it is called a crowne by resemblance because it is giuen in the end of the life as the cro ne is giuen in the end of the race master perkins denies the consequence of the enthymem viz that therefore euerlasting life must be deserued because it is called a crowne he addes the reason of his deniall that it is called a crowne not because it is deserued but because it is giuen as a reward after we are come to the end of our race as the tim apostle shewes plainly i haue fought a good fight and haue finished my course i haue kept the faith hencefoorth is laid vp for me a crowne of righteousnes he saith not therefore i haue deserued the crowne if that were all the cause and that there were no respect to be had so former deserts it might then as well be called a halter by resemblance because that also is giuen in the end of life and in their opinion more properly because all their workes are defiled like a menstruous cloath and a halter is the end of such wicked workes but as a halter is due to a theefe so is a crowne of glory the iust reward of the righteous man that i may omit your lewd dallying in saying that euerlasting life might in that respect as well be called a halter consider whether your answer be not absurd for that which is giuen vpon continuance of walking in good workes as master perkins saith the crowne is cannot in any reason be as well termed a halter as a crowne though there be not in the workes the true and whole nature of merit to deserue the crowne euerlasting life saith glossa ordin ad tim amp lombardus ibi your glosse is as it were the reward of faith and god seemes to pay it quasi ces videtu deus tanquam debitum reddere gloss as it were debt and it is called a crowne of righteousnes not because it belongs to any man by due and desert but because god hath bound himselfe by a promise to giue it in performing whereof he is tearmed iust and by vertue of this promise it is obtained and no otherwise these are the principall obiections by which we may iudge what the rest are and thus we see what is the truth namely that merit is necessarie to saluation yet neither merit of mans worke or person but the merit of christ imputed to vs whereby we being in him doe procure and deserue the fauour of god and life eternall secondly he answereth that it is called a crowne of iustice because god hath bound himselfe by his promise to giue it here then at length we haue by his owne confession that by god promise eternall life is due debt vnto the righteous but as hauing ouer shot himselfe he addes not for any desert of theirs but only for the promise sake but as you haue heard before out of s matthew that promise was made for vvorking the time of our life in his vine yard and so there was some desert on their part and the servant were rewarded because they imployed their talents well needes it any defence to say it is due debt by promise but not vpon desert who knowes not that for the most part these two are if not contrary at the least diverse therefore rather you shoote beyond true reason than master perkins ouershot himselfe that which you repeate out of saint matthew was answered before and in this very place s paul reckoneth vp his good seruices for which the iust iudge would render him a crowne of iustice and therfore the iustice is not only in respect of god promise s paul reckons vp his good seruices and good reason for the reward is not due to any by promise but to them that doe good workes for else what should be rewarded but why should it be called a crowne of iustice because it is giuen to the iust saith thomas ad tim thomas secundunc opera iusta according to their iust works and in that respect god is called a iust iudge in giuing this crowne because he giues good for good yes that very iustice whereby good is giuen for good is not without mercie saith the glossa ordin bona pro bonis glosse and lombardus ibi lombard and if you will not beleeue me prouing that i say out of the very text rather then m perkins on his bare word let s augustine be arbitrator betweene vs who most deepely considereth of euery word in this sentence let vs heare saith he the apostle speaking vvhen he approached neere vnto his passion j haue quote he fought a good fight j haue accomplished my course j haue kept the faith concerning the rest there is laid vp for me a crowne of iustice vvhich our lord will render vnto me in that day a iust iudge and not only to me but to them also that loue his comming he saith that our lord a iust iudge will render vnto him a crovvne he therefore doth owe it and as a iust iudge will pay it for the vvorke being regarded the revvard cannot be denied i haue fought a good fight is a vvorke i haue accomplished my course is a vvorke j haue kept the faith is a worke there is laid vp for me a crowne of iustice this is the reward so that you see most clearely by this most learned fathers iudgement that the reward is due for the worke sake and not only for the promise of god this place of austin is brought as a proofe that a man hath nothing of himselfe which hee hath not receiued whereas if your doctrine of merit and free will were true a man hauing grace from god whereby hee is enabled to worke might of his owne free will so vse this grace that euerlasting life should be due to him as wages for his work but if these good workes proceed from grace not onely in respect of our abilitie to doe them but of the particular actions what true merit can there bee in them immediatly after the words you alleage it followes aug lib homily homil in austin in the reward thou doest nothing in the work nothing alone the crowne is from him the worke from thy selfe yet not without his helpe which helpe we must vnderstand to be more than an abilitie to worke or else as i said our free will shall haue the chiefe commendation in all our good workes but to the testimonie we graunt that the reward is due to the worke which is your conclusion out of austin but wee denie that it is due vpon desert of the worke for neither doth the worke if it were perfectly done truly and properly deserue the reward because it is a matter of duty and but one work whereas many thousands are due to make vp true merit by workes and being imperfect as all our best workes are it is so farre from deseruing euerlasting life that it rather might increase our sinnes if god should strictly in iustice examine it see him vpon that verse of the psalme j vvill sing vnto thee o lord mercy and iudgement where he concludes that god in iudgement will ont of his iustice crowne those good workes which he of mercy had giuen grace to doe we doe wholy subscribe to s austin that god cannot but reward our workes because of his promise and because they are such for the substance of them as he hath enioyned and so as i haue said often in generall iustice they that doe well must haue well but we adde hereunto first that these works did not by their due worth wring this promise from god as if he had been vniust vnlesse he had made it which must haue been if they be truly and wholy such merits that euerlasting life is necessarily due to them as wages secondly the promise being made we say further that none of our works are so exactly performed according to the rule of god iustice but that hee might iustly denie vs the reward promised thirdly we affirme that it is not euerlasting life or the kingdome of heauen properly taken which god hath promised and owes to our workes but onely the measure of glorie in heauen the kingdome is due to vs as an inheritance by the right of sonnes the diverse measure of glorie is met out to euery one according to his workes and for his workes yet not vpon their desert but vpon god gratious promise and mercifull acceptance pardoning our sinnes and rewarding vs aboue our deserts and that the reader may vnderstand that not only s augustine doth so confidently teach this doctrine of merits which m perkins blushed not to tearme the inuention of satan i will fold vp this question vvith some testimonies of the most auncient and best authours saint ignatius the apostles auditour saith giue me leaue to become the foode of beastes that i may by that meanes merit and vvinne god for answer to the testimonies of the ancient writers we must remember that to merit doth signifie in them to worke and to obtaine and that very commonly and in like sort merits are ordinarily taken for good works beside their testimonies for the most part intreat of reward not of wages and we deny not that god will reward euery least good worke of his children now to the seuerall allegations we may easily obserue in this ignatius ad roman ignatius that oueruehement desire of martyrdom that caryed away very many as it appeares by gregory greg nazian monod in obitum ba ilij nazianzen who commends basils father because he had no such zeale without knowledge and condemnes though not by name this counterfaite ignatius who is so hot vpon martyrdom that he sayeth he will prouoke the wild beast to teare him in peeces if they as sometimes it fell out questionles by daniel hebr god great prouidence should refraine to fasten on him now if this man should somewhat ouerprize his deserts i thinke it were no great wonder but i had rather excuse him if you wil let me and say he meanes by meriting nothing but enioying god which he was to obtaine after this life and therefore so much longed for his dissolution as for the other word winne it is your addition to make the allegation the more likely if you will not allow of this excuse i say plainely this mans testimonie is nothing worth because he was of little iudgement in diuinitie as it is euident by his whole epistle and especiallie by this absurd sentence whosoeuer saith he doth not fast euery lord day or sabbath except easter day only is a murder of christ but he may serue your turne for number though not for waight iustine a glorious martyr of the next age hath these vvords speaking in the name of all christians we thinke that man vvho by vvorkes haue shevved themselues worthy of the vvill and counsaile of god shall by their merits liue and raigne vvith him free from all corruption and perturbation iustin apo log ad anton iustin neither speakes nor thinks in that place of the question in hand but writing to a heathen emperour tels him that christians hold this doctrine that they which shew themselues conformable or fitted to god will by their works dignatum iri shall be vouchsafed his company and raigne with him free from corruption and passion if you will haue the word translated thought worthy it is all one though the latin be otherwise and the meaning of the other word as the case in the greeke shewes and the translation both being the datiue howsoeuer you mistooke the latine which is not the ablatiue case as you translate it saint ireneus saith vve esteeme that crovvne to be pretious vvhich i gotten by combate and suffering for god sake irenaeus te s vs that the apostle paul exhorts to striue or fight that we may thinke the crowne pretious for indeede as he saith lib cap there we make most account of those things which we hardliest come by so that the more paines we take in striuing the more pretious shall wee thinke the crowne to be this is irenaeus true meaning as any man may see that will looke on the place but what is this to proue that our works deserue euerlasting life for wages as for the suffering for god sake it is of your deuising and adding not of irenaeus writing saint basill all we that vvalke the vvay of the gospell as marchants doe buy and get the possession of heauenly things by the vvorkes of the commaundements a man is saued by vvorkes of iustice we acknowledge a comparison of likenes between marchants and christians but we denie an equalitie of valew in the commodity we are to vtter which we do the rather because in those parables to which basil orat in initium prouerb basil in this place alludes mat though the field and the pearle are said to bee bought yet no man imagins that the price paid for them is of equall worth to the purchase neither doth it follow that if as basil saith a man be saued by per iusti am operum the righteousnes of works then his works are of full valew to the saluation he obtaines by them saint cyprian if the day of our returne shall finde vs vnloaden svvi t and running in the race of workes our lord will not faile to reward our merits he vvill giue for workes to those that vvinne in peace a white crowne and for martyrdome in persecution he vvill redouble vnto them a purple crovvne what saith cyprian ser de l mos in fine cyprian but that god if we perseuere to the end in well doing will reward our works according to the diuersitie of them with lesse or more glory we say as much but the question is whether our works fully deserue euerlasting life or no saint hilarie the kingdome of heauen is the hier and revvard of them that liue vvell and perfectly hilar in mat can hilary expounding that exhortation of our sauiour math seeke ye first the kingdome of god and his righteousnes counsailes man to seeke it vitae nostrae stipendijs with the labour of their life and this saith he is the reward for there is but one word merces of them that liue well and perfitly he saith not that any mans worke is perfit inough truly and wholie to deserue it saint ambrose is it not euident that there remaineth after this life either revvard for merits or punishment ambros de offic lib cap ambrose speakes not of the valew of good works but labours to take away that offence that commonly troubles man when they see that euill man fare better then good in this world he answers that in the world to come the case shall be altered the one shall be rewarded and the other punished for their works which he calls merits saint hierome novv after baptisme it appertaineth to our trauailes according vnto the diuersity of vertue to prepare for vs different rewards you might as well haue left out ieromes testimonie as you do the quoting of it for it makes nothing for you nor against vs that wee are to prepare different rewards for our selues according to the diuersitie of vertue what if he had said merit do we not graunt it but where is deseruing euerlasting life in ieromes words saint bernard prouide that thou haue merits for the vvant of them is a pernitions pouertie penury of works saith bernard ser in cantic bernard is dangerous pouerty who denyes it it followes but presumption of spirit is deceitfull riches who presumes if he do not that thinks himselfe absolutely worthie of heauen as wages briefly that this was the vniuersall doctrine of all good christians aboue a thousand yeares past is declared in the councell of arausicane revvard is debt vnto good vvorkes if they be done but grace vvhich vvas not debte goeth before that they may be done these testimonies of the most auncient and best learned christians may suffice to batter the brasen forehead of them that affirme the doctrine of merits to be a satanicall inuention and to settle all them that haue care of their saluation in the most pure doctrine of the catholike church the concil arausic can councell of orenge saith nothing that was not said before in the testimonies of the fathers neither needs any other answer the doubt is not whether reward be due to good works but by what right it is due whereof the councell saith nothing expresly the doctrine of merits as it was held and taught by the auncient christians before the discouerie of your roman antichrist we acknowledge and embrace howsoeuer perhaps some particular man may haue gon a little too farre in their amplifications but the doctrine that is maintained by your church and councell of trent we disclaime and detest as the principall meanes next to direct pelagianisme to puffe vp the pride of mans heart and to take away true thankfulnes and trust in god that is to ouerthrow the gospell the end whereof is beleeuing in christ to iustification and saluation for if as by your doctrine it must needs be man do at the first by the good vse of his freewill receiue grace and by the same freewill though in both cases inlightened and inspired merit his saluation truly and wholie as the day labouring man doth his wages what glory can god haue or what thanks doth christ deserue for any particular mans saluation he prouided the meanes you will say that peter for example might be saued if he would so did he that iudas might be he offered the meanes to peter amp to iudas too how chance peter receiued this grace and iudas did not you answer because peter would and iudas would not but how came it to passe that peter would and iudas would not here is the first difference was it because god of his loue to peter wrought in his heart by his spirit so that it could not come to passe but he should beleeue and left iudas to himselfe who so left would neuer beleeue so we teach according to the truth of the gospell but you perswade your people that it was peter that made the difference between himselfe and iudas not god who left the matter to the free will of both alike that either or neither of them might be saued as pleased them but what is peter by this beleeuing in christ an heire of heauen no only he is now in such an estate as that he may if he will earne euerlasting life as the hire and wages of his works i appeale now to any christian soule that hath but the least desire to aduance god glory aboue his owne to giue sentence of this matter out of the truth of his heart what doth god by the doctrine of popery but only prouide that man may come to heauen if they will and how forsooth vpon our sauiour christs deserts he is content to giue man grace whereby they may be able to merit their owne saluation but he will giue this grace to no man who shall not first vpon good motions inspired prepare himselfe of his owne free will by faith feare hope loue repentance to the receiuing of it hauing receiued it he must now by good works to which he is enabled deserue euerlasting life so fully as that god should be vniust if he should not giue it him for the worthines of the worke he hath done for whereas he made a promise of a reward it was no more then he was bound to do in true iustice our works without his promise deseruing the reward truly and wholie this is the doctrine of your church touching faith and works which master perkins iustly calls a satanicall inuention because it ouerthrowes the glory of god mercy to establish the pride of mans free will now whereas we teach that our works do not by their worth deserue euerlasting life what hurt is it if it were false but only that it were false to make man thinke themselues wholie bound to god for their iustification and glorification for we vrge necessitie of works and assurance of reward as well as you though not to merit euerlasting glory by them if any man be so thankeles or so proude that he will not worke vnlesse he may merit by working he neuer felt himselfe to be a son and shall receiue the wages of servant the iust hire of his sinnes damnation conclus i first we acknowledge and hold ciuill or politike satisfaction that is a recompence for iniuries and damages offered any way to our neighbours this zacheus practised when at his conuersion he restored foure fold things gotten by forged cauillation againe by ciuill satisfaction i vnderstand the imposition of fines mulcts and penalties vpon offenders and the inflicting of death vpon malefactors for all these are satisfactions to the lawe and societies of man when they are wronged all these we maintain as necessary for neither church nor common wealth can well bee without them considering they are notable meanes to vphold ciuill peace and otherwhiles they are fruits of true faith as the satisfaction of zacheus was this is wittily acknowledged by him but little exercised among pro testants for where the sacrament of confession is wanting there man vse very seldome to recompence so much as onefold for their extorsion bribes vsury and other craftie ouer reaching of their neighbours whatsoeuer our practice be and yet if it did not exceed yours we had good cause to be ashamed of it the question is now of our doctrine which master perkins hath truly deliuered as for the helpe you would haue imagined to come from auricular confession to the exercise of satisfaction who is so ignorant of your courses in appointing penance that he knowes not how little you inioyne this satisfaction and how easily it may be bought out if it be enioyned with some contribution to some of your abbeyes frieries churches chappels and such like but of this kind of satisfaction which we commonly call restitution vve are not here to treate nor of that publike penance which for notorious crimes is done openly there was reason to mention this publike penance as well that all man might the better vnderstand what is in question as also because the testimonies which in this case your man alleage are wholy or principally of that kinde of satisfaction but of such priuate penance which is either enioy ed by the confessor or voluntarily vndertaken by the penitent or else sent by god visitation to purge vs from that temporall paine which for sinnes past and pardoned we are to endure either in this life or in purgatorie if we die before we haue fully satisfied here your speech and matter are both very strange who would speak so by visitation that is by punishment to purge man from paine that should be endured may a man satisfie against his will or without his knowledge for both these fall out in god visitations that a man is visited against his will wholy if hee could helpe it and that hee doth not so much as once thinke vpon satisfying for his sinnes by it yes sometimes if he should he should thinke amisse for all visitations of god are not ion iob amp chastisements for sinne but speciall trials and meanes of god glorie conclus ii wee acknowledge canonicall or ecclesiasticall satisfaction and that is when any hauing giuen offence to the church of god or any part thereof doe make an open publike testimonie of their repentance mirian for murmuring against moses was stricken with leprosie and afterward by his prayer shee was clensed and yet for all that shee must goe seuen daies out of the tent and congregation that shee might make a kinde of satisfaction to the people for her trespasse and in the old testament sackcloth and ashes were signes of their satisfaction conclus iii we hold that no man can be saued vnlesse he make a perfect satisfaction to the iustice of god for all his sinnes because god is infinite in iustice and therefore will either exact an euerlasting punishment or satisfaction for the same the points of our difference and dissent are these the church of rome teacheth and beleeueth that christ by his death hath made a satisfaction for all the sinnes of man and for the eternall punishment of them all yet so as they themselues must satisfie the iustice of god for the temporall punishment of their offences either on earth or in purgatorie wee teach and beleeue that christ by his death and passion hath made a perfect and all sufficient satisfaction to the iustice of god for all the sinnes of man and for the whole punishment thereof both eternall and temporall thus wee differ and herein wee for our parts must for euer stand at difference with them so as if there were no more points of variance but this one it should bee sufficient to keepe vs alwaies from vniting our religions and cause vs to obey the voyce of christ come out of her my people for as in the former points so in this also the papists erre not in circumstance but in the very foundation and life of religion m perkins in his third conclusion decreeth very solemnely that no man can be saued vnlesse bs make a perfect satisfaction vnto the iustice of god for all his sinnes yet in the explication of the difference betvveene vs defineth as peremptonly that no man is to satisfie for any one of all his sinnes or for any temporall paine due to them which be flat contradictorie propositions and therefore the one of them must needs be false but such odde broken rubbish doth he commonly cast into the ground vvorke of his questions and therupon raiseth the tottering building of his nevv doctrine and lets not like a blind man to make an outcrie that in this matter the papists erre in the very foundation and life of religion is it contradiction to say that euery man must make satisfaction and that christ hath made satisfaction might you not easily haue vnderstood if you did not that the satisfaction which christ hath made is made by euery one that beleeues in him so then the latter proposition doth not contradict the former but shew by what meanes that satisfaction is made which in the former was required euerie man must satisfie and euery man doth satisfie by and in christ are not contradictorie propositions as a man with halfe an eye may see the very foundation and life of religion is the acknowledging of full redemption by the sacrifice of iesus christ but how can that be acknowledged where satisfaction remaines to be made by perhaps many thousand yeeres punishment i a satisfaction that is made imperfect either directly or by consequent is indeede no satisfaction at all but the papists make christs satisfaction imperfect in that they doe adde a supply by humane satisfactions and thus much a learned schooleman biel in plaine words confessed although saith he the passion of christ be the principal merit for which grace is conferred the opening of the kingdome and glory yet is it neuer the alone and totall meritorious cause it is manifest because alwaies with the merit of christ there concurreth some worke as the merit of congruitie or condignity of him that receiueth grace or glorie if hee bee of yeeres and haue the vse of reason or of some other for him if he want reason for that which admitts a supply by another is imperfect in it selfe therefore humane satisfactions cannot stand this is a substantiall argument to raise the cry vpon vvhich hath both propositions false the first is childish for he that satisfieth for halfe his debts or for any part of them makes some satisfaction vvhich satisfaction is vnperfect and yet cannot be called no satisfaction at all as euery child may see satisfaction is a full discharge of the debt so that the bond thereupon is voide but hee that paies halfe or three quarters of his debt if he pay not all in such sort as the bond requireth hath the bond still against him in ful strength and vertue so that though hee hath paid part of his principall debt he hath made no satisfaction at all learned papists make answere that christs satisfaction and mans may stand well together for say they christs satisfaction is sufficient in it selfe to answere the iustice of god for all sin and punishment but it is not sufficient to this or that man till it be applied and it must bee applied by our satisfaction made to god for the temporall punishment of our sinnes but i say againe that mans satisfaction can bee no meanes to apply the satisfaction of christ and i prooue it thus the meanes of applying god blessings and graces vnto man are twofold some respect god himselfe and some respect man those which respect god are such whereby god on his part doth offer and conuey his mercies in christ vnto man of this sort are the preaching of the worde baptisme and the lord supper and these are as it were the hand of god whereby he reacheth downe and giueth vnto vs christ with all his benefites the other meanes of applying on mans part are those whereby the saide benefits are receiued of this sort there is onely one namely faith whereby we beleeue that christ with all his benefits belong vnto vs and this is the hand of man whereby he receiueth christ as he is offered or exhibited by god in the word and sacraments as for other meanes beside these in scripture we finde none foolish therfore is the answere of the papists that make mens satisfactions meanes to apply the satisfaction of christ vnto vs for by humane satisfactions christ is neither offered on god part nor yet receiued on mans part let them prooue it if they can his second is as vntrue but mans satisfaction is not to supplie the vvant of christs satisfaction but to applie it to vs as m perkins saith his faith doth to them and to fulfill his vvill and ordinance first the speech is beyond any ordinarie mans vnderstanding to make satisfaction is to applie another mans satisfaction to vs secondly to make satisfaction is to deserue that because of our satisfaction for the temporall punishment due to our sinnes christs satisfaction for the eternall may be auailable to vs thirdly if mans satisfaction be not to supplie the want of christs satisfaction either there is no temporall punishment belonging to sinne or christ hath made satisfaction for that as well as for the eternall and then god cannot require any satisfaction of vs because he is alreadie satisfied both for the eternall and temporall punishment fourthly if wee doe nothing by our satisfaction but applie christs satisfaction to vs which is onely for the eternall punishment the temporall remaines wholy without satisfaction made for it god doth in baptisme for christs sake pardon both all sinnes and taketh fully avvay all paine due to sinne so that he vvho dieth in that state goeth presently to heauen but if vve doe aftervvard vngratefully forsake god and contrary to our promise transgresse against his commaundements then loe the order of his diuine iustice requires that we be not so easily receiued againe into his fauour but he vpon our repentance pardoning the sinne and the eternall punishment due vnto it through christ doth exact of euerie man a temporall satisfaction ansvverable vnto the fault committed not to supplie christs satisfaction which was of infinite value and might more easily haue taken away this temporall punishment then it doth the eternall but that by the smart and griefe of this punishment the man may be feared from sinning and be made more carefull to auoide sinne and also by this meanes be made members conformable to christ our head that suffering with him we may raigne with him and therefore he hauing satisfied for the eternall punishment which we are not able to do doth lay the temporall paine vpon our shoulders that according vnto the apostle euery man do beare his ovvne burden here is a long discourse to little purpose neither answering any part of master perkins syllogisme nor defending any point of your owne answere but onely affirming that which before was said that god exacts a temporall satisfaction and affoording vs some reason to confute your opinion by in this sort if christs satisfaction was sufficient more easily to take away the temporall punishment than the eternall how will you prooue it did not it stands you vpon to shew vs good euidence out of the record of scripture that god agreed with christ not to take the full desert of his sufferings and satisfaction but to leaue man still indebted to him though in truth the debt were paid if no such agreement can be shewed for my part i see not how god in iustice can aske the same debt twice being once fully satisfied that which you adde is wholy our doctrine viz that god by smart and griefe would feare vs from sinning and make vs conformable to his son our sauiour but you teach that he punisheth vs and so takes satisfaction for sins past as if he were to be reuenged on vs at least by temporall punishment for our sinnes committed you repeate your conclusion but with no dependance vpon your former matter or proofe from that which followes where gal the apostle tels the galathians that they may not be alwaies finding fault with other man and so grow into a conceit of their owne goodnes but looke to themselues because euery man must giue an account to god for his owne sinnes and not for another mans if you will needs abuse the apostle and applie his words to that he thought not on why doe you not by the same reason lay the eternall punishment vpon vs too for that was our burthen as well as the temporall others not content with this their former answer say that our satisfactions doe nothing derogate from the satisfaction of christ because our workes haue their dignitie and merit from christs satisfaction he meriting that our works should satisfie god iustice for temporal punishment but this is also absurd and false as the former was for if christ did satisfie that man might satisfie then christ doth make euery beleeuer to be a christ a iesus a redeemer and a priest in the same order with his owne selfe but to make sinful man his own redeemer though it be but from temporall punishments is a doctrine of diuels for the holy ghost teacheth that the priesthood of christ is incommunicable amp cannot passe from him to another now to make satisfaction for sinne or any part of the punishment thereof is a dutie or a part of christ his priesthood and therefore to make satisfaction is a worke that cannot passe from his person to the person of any man nay saith m perkins we must then be new christs and redeemers and priests of the same order with himselfe nothing so but hauing grace from him we may in vertue therof satisfie not for the crime it self or euerlasting punishment which is lincked with it because that would require an infinite vertue but for the temporall paine of it one indued with grace may satisfie for the measure of stripes must not exceede the rate of the fault the punishment then resting vnsatisfied being limited a creature may pay it it was not for nothing that you would not set downe master perkins words for you saw well enough that if you should doe so your poore blinded papists would venture to reade them which now they dare not doe and so your weaknes in answering might be discouered master perkins hath refuted your answere of applying christs satisfaction before it was hatcht you passe it by as not seene and propound his answere to another obiection by halues leauing the obiection out altogether i will make the matter as plaine as i can with shortnes you papists say that christs satisfaction merited that mans workes should satisfie for temporall punishment master perkins denies it vpon this reason if christ did satisfie that man might satisfie he made euery beleeuer a christ a iesus a redeemer a priest in the same order with himselfe but he did not make man christs and iesuses redeemers and priests in the same order with himselfe therefore he did not satisfie that man might satisfie the assumption he prooues hebr because christs priesthood cannot be communicated to any other the consequence of the proposition depends vpon this that satisfaction is a part of christs priesthood you denie the consequence but neither shew any reason of your deniall nor answere his proofe onely you tell vs that a man is able to beare the temporall punishment though not the eternall as though wee denied temporall because a man cannot beare it and that the reader may better perceiue what we meane by the temporall paine let him consider that in sinne there are two things the one is the turning away from god whom we offend the other is the turning to the thing for the loue of which we offend as for glorie lust lucre or such like the sinner transgresseth novv vvhen he is by the grace of god conuerted his turning avvay from god both the sin and the eternall paine due vnto it are freely through christ pardoned but for the pleasure vvhich he tooke in the sinne the man himselfe is to satisfie and so according vnto the greatnes of that his pleasure he is to doe penance first your distinction belongs not to all sinnes and so prooues satisfaction needfull but for some sinnes onely to what doth a man turne when in the error of his iudgement he denies christ to bee god without any respect of glorie lucre lust or such like again may not a man sweare vnaduisedly and rashly without this turning and without any pleasure in that sinne yes may not a man thinke the murthering of his soueraigne lawful and meritorious as many popish traytors haue done without this turning to i cannot tell what sinne is the transgression of god commendements as for this turning to and from it is an idle speculation of man that seeke a knot in a rush he that doth that which god forbids whatsoeuer the occasion or end of his doing be sinnes in so doing he that makes his money his god sinnes not because he loues his money or turnes to his money but because hee loues it otherwise than hee should and so turnes from god to it secondly what a fond distinction is that between the sin and the pleasure in the sinne is not that pleasure in the sin a sinne too if it be voluntarie and if it be not voluntarie but onely be a consequent vpon the sinne hauing no ground in the will any way how is it punishable againe if christ by his satisfaction giue power to man to satisfie then man doth satisfie by christ and christ beside his owne satisfaction vpon the crosse must daily satisfie in man to the ende of the world but this cannot be for christ vpon the crosse when death was vpon him said it is finished that is i haue fully satisfied for all the sins of mankinde both in respect of the fault and punishment as for christs buriall amp resurrection which followeth his death they serued not to satisfie but to confirme and ratifie the same but christ saith m perkins said on the crosse it is finished vvherefore all satisfaction vvas at christs death ended as vvell temporall as eternall ans that those vvords haue a farre different sense to vvitte that christ had then ended his course and fulfilled all prophecies and endured all such torments as pleased god to impose vpon him for the redemption of mankind of satisfaction temporall there is no mention neither can any thing be dravvne thence against it there is no mention of any satisfaction at all and yet you grant that eternall satisfaction is there signified you must then shew some good reason why the one was then finished and not the other which it is vnpossible for you to doe because you confesse that both were then performed for all sinnes before baptisme look by what reason you can draw that doctrine from that place by the same will we conclude the other if you will say al was done that belongs to mans redemption i aske whether christ haue not also redeemed vs from temporall punishment you grant from all that was due to sinne before baptisme i demaund further whether these punishments were not part of that penaltie which the breach of god law laies vpon vs if they were then either we are redeemed from them by christ or he hath not made perfect redemption but questionlesse his redemption is perfect and these are punishments due to sinne therfore he hath freed vs from these also againe paul saith corinthian hee that knew no sin was made sinne for vs that is the punishment of sinne for vs but if the church of rome say true that christ doth daily satisfie then paul spake too short and should haue said further that christ was made sinne for vs and in vs too and that god was not on ly in christ but also in vs reconciling the world to himselfe but paul neuer knew this learning and therfore let them turne themselues which way they wil by putting a supplement to christs satisfaction they doe indeede annihilate the same no more can be out of this other christ vvas made sinne for vs that is the punishment of sinne as m perkins gloseth it but the learned say an hoast or sacrifice for sin but vve raun that he suffered the punishment for our sinne and say consequently that all sin is pardoned freely for his sake and the paine of hell also vvhich is punishment of sinne but not other temporall paines such as it hath pleased the iustice and vvisdome of god to reserue vnto euery si ner to beare in his ovvne person and after this sort and no other vvas god in christ reconciling the vvorld to himselfe if christ were a sacrifice for sinne i say as before either he was an vnperfect sacrifice which to say were blasphemous or hee wrought our redemption from the whole wrath of god and so from all punishment ensuing thereupon vnlesse as i noted before you can shew any agreement to the contrarie between god and christ and that s paul vnderstood vvell that christ suff rings did not take avvay ours may be gathered by these his vvords i reioyce in suffering for you and doe accomplish those things that vvant of the passions of christ in my flesh for his body vvhich is the church but of this point more vvhen vve come vnto the arguments for the ca holike part wee doe not say that christs sufferings take away ours for we must still suffer for diverse reasons aboue recited but that his satisfaction leaues vs no place for ours we suffer but not to satisfie neither doth saint paul say any such thing reason ii in sundrie places of scripture especially in the epistles of paul we are said to be redeemed iustified and saued freely which word freely doth import that we are iustified and saued without any thing done on our part or by our selues in the matter of our saluation and if this bee so then can wee doe nothing at all that may satisfie the iustice of god for the least punishment of our sinnes if wee satisfie in our owne persons we are not saued freely and if we be saued freely we make no satisfaction at all novv to m perkins second reason in sundrie places saith he of scripture we are said to be redeemed iustified and saued freely but this vvord freely importeth that vve are saued vvithout doing any thing our selues in that matter of saluation ans not so good sir for euen in your owne doctrine it is necessary that ye beleeue and bring forth the fruits of repentance and that now and then yee make some short prayers and receiue the communion and doe many other odde things in that matter of saluation wherfore the word freely doth not exclude all our working and suffering in that matter master perkins meanes not to exclude all doing on our part but all doing to merit or satisfaction as it appeares by the proposition of his syllogisme in the end if we satisfie in our person we are not saued freely if we be saued freely we make no satisfaction at all now although all doing be not against free saluation yet all doing to merit and satisfie is directly against it reason iii we pray daily forgiue vs our sinnes now to pleade pardon and to satisfie for our sinnes bee contrarie and for all things for which wee can make satisfaction we neede not craue a pardon but we are taught in the foresaid petition wholy and only to vse the plea or pardon for our sinnes and therefore we acknowledge that we cannot make any satisfaction at all if our sinnes be mortall we craue pardon both of the sinne and the eternall punishment annexed and do willingly withall satisfie for the temporall paine as the man who is conuicted of high treason and hauing both his life honor lands and goods pardoned and restored vnto him doth very ioyfully endure three monethes imprisonment and any reasonable fine set on his head in this as in diverse other arguments namely the very next before you onely set downe the first lines and neuer propound the reason that you may answere to it directly i must doe it for you if we can satisfie for sinne we need not craue pardon for it but we need craue pardon for it therefore we cannot satisfie for it your answere cannot well be applied to any part of this syllogisme but in effect it seemes to be as much as if you should denie the assumption not simply but with this distinction that we need craue pardon for the eternall punishment but not for the temporall then the meaning of that petitio in the lord prayer is forgiue vs the eternall punishment due to our sins which is to aske forgiuenes by halues lyra ad math lyra saith we pray that our sinnes may be totaliter wholy forgiuen both in respect of the fault and of the punishment and that hee meanes temporall punishment too it appeareth by his reason because so long as that remaines we cannot enter into blessednes witnes the poore soules that ie so many yeeres in your purgatorie if our sinnes be veniall then that prayer is a speciall meane both to obtaine pardon of the fault and release of all the paine as witnesseth s augustine saying that for the daily short and light offences vvithout vvhich this life is not ledde the daily prayer of the faithfull doth satisfie you seeme also to denie the consequence of the proposition in your answere about veniall sinnes for which you say we may satisfie by praying for pardon but this is a marueilous strange satisfaction that a man should be said to satisfie by desiring to be pardoned and then wee haue a further meaning in the lord prayer that god would accept it as a satisfaction for our veniall sinnes can any reasonable man imagine that our sauiour did not teach vs to pray for the full pardon of all punishment due to sinne and yet neuer gaue notice of any such distinction but of this more afterward austin speakes of the different course that is to be held in repenting of our sinnes that according as they are greater or lesse so we should be the more or lesse carefull of obtaining pardon which for ordinarie sinnes may be had by ordinarie praying not as if this made a sufficient amends to god which satisfaction imports but because he lookes not for so much sorrow and care for these sinnes as for those by which if we commit them we shall highly dishonour him and therefore neede to grieue more that wee may the more carefully auoide them if you will draw austin to the worst wee may not follow him against the truth of the scripture and that is not true which m perkins addes that we are taught in that prayer wholy and only to vse the plea of pardon for in thesame petition we are taught also to pardon others euen as we will looke to be pardoned we are taught onely to pleade pardon the clause that is added is not to satisfie god or deserue forgiuenes but to perswade god to forgiue vs as wee pardon other or as luke luke expounds it for euen wee are so kinde as to forgiue them that offend vs how then should god not shew his kindnes when he is intreated againe if there were only a plea of pardon it would not serue master perkins purpose for who would say that within the compasse of the pater noster all things necessary to saluation be conteined if praying for pardon of sinne be a sufficient meanes for the procuring of it to them that beleeue in christ surely there is no satisfaction necessarie that it is such a meanes it is plaine because our sauiour wils vs not here to vse any other meanes and yet assures vs that our requests shall be granted you answer that all things necessarie are not contained in the pater noster what of that it will serue our turne that the lord prayer prescribes sufficient meanes for the obtaining of pardon and yet meddles not with satisfaction but what speak you of things necessarie to saluation the satisfaction in question is of no such nature for you tell vs that all feare of eternall punishment is taken away by christ and a man may come to heauen though hee neuer dreame of any temporall satisfaction the worst is but the enduring of the painted fire of purgatorie for a certaine time besides prayer is one part of satisfaction as shall be proued hereafter and so by oft praying for pardon we may well satisfie for much temporall punishment praying for pardon is a poore satisfaction else might a felon or a traytor easily satisfie for his fault and the punishment especially for the imprisonment and fine you speake of but we shall examine this better when we come to answere your profe of it reason iv the iudgement of the auncient church tertul de baptism guiltinesse being taken away the punishment is also taken away m perkins fourth argument is taken out of certaine odde fragments of auncient writers guiltines being taken avvay the punishment is also taken avvay true he that is guilty of nothing cannot iustly be punished for guiltines is a binding vp to punishment as m perkins defineth then if the band to punishment be cancelled the party is freed but all this is nothing to the purpose for guiltines of temporall punishment doth remaine after the sin and guilt of eternall be released if by these odde fragments you meane the treatises of the authors whence the testimonies are fetcht you are glad to patch vp your profes out of these odde fragments if you meane the sentences alleaged what bring you of this kind but odde fragments and what else can be brought vnlesse a man should absurdly write out the whole treatise your answere is nothing to tertullians purpose who speakes of washing by baptisme in which both guilt and punishment are wholie taken away death saith tertul is cap tertullian is destroyed by washing away of sinnes but death is the whole punishment of sinne gen the day thou eatest thou shalt dye therefore freedome from death is freedome from the whole punishment sermon de verbis apost august christ by taking vpon him the punishment and not the fault hath done away both fault and the punishment iust the eternall punishment which was due to that fault not the temporall as s augustine himselfe declareth god of compassion doth blot out our sinnes committed if conuenient satisfaction be not on our parts neglected to what was the temporall punishment due if to the fault it is taken away vnlesse there be some fault for which christ hath not satisfied or that punishment may be due where there is no fault beside the punishment that austin speakes of as you would easily haue seene if you had lookt vpon the place and not answered by gesse rather then by skill is our mortalitie which is no part of the eternall punishment he saith aug de verb dom ser austin in his sermon de verbis domini not de verbis apostoli where there are in all but had two good things righteousnes and immortalitie we two naughtie things sinne and mortalitie sinne as he shewes afterward was our fault mortalitie our punishment this christ tooke vpon him that he did not and by taking the one freed vs from both namely so that mortalitie is no longer a punishment and we by him shall be come immortall as for the satisfaction he requires it is not to procure release of any punishment belonging to vs but to shew our repentance which god will take knowledge of by outward actions so that when he sees them he may seale vp our forgiuenes by assurance of it and tomorrow homily he saith when wee are gone out of this world there will remaine no compunction or satisfaction some new editions haue foisted in the worde aliqua and so haue turned the sense on this manner there will remaine no compunction or some satisfaction but this is flat against augustines meaning who saith a little before that when the way is ended there is no compounding of our cause with any to that other sentence out of him vvhen vve are gone out of this vvorld there vvill remaine no compunction or satisfaction it is easie to answere vvithout the helpe of any new edition for it will be too late then to repent and so there is no place left to compunction that is contrition of hart neither consequently to confession or satisfaction as if he had said before we goe out of this world there is place for both compunction and satisfaction and so that place is rather for vs the satisfaction required by austin is nothing else but true repentance or newnes of life that we loue god our neighbours and our enemy as it followeth immediatly vpon the words set downe that we may saith aug lib homily homil austin do all these things that is haue compunction and make satisfaction by the help of god let vs loue not our friends only but our enemy also that that may be fulfilled in vs which is written the whole law is fulfilled in one word thou shalt loue thy neighbour as thy selfe now this is a necessarie dutie and cannot be properly any satisfaction but for such satisfaction as we make by repentance there is place in this world and howsoeuer a man himselfe cannot make satisfaction in his owne person but by suffering after this life yet by your doctrine he may by other man and haue full pardon and release procured him at the popes hands or otherwise by masses and almes paid for and bestowed after his departure and therefore in your learning austin shewes either his ignorance or his craft in telling vs that we cannot satisfie hereafter which is not true but of satisfying in our owne persons chrysost prooem in isaiah say not to me i haue sinned how shall i be freed from so many sinnes thou canst not but thy god can yes and he will so blot out thy sinnes that there shall remaine no print of them which thing befalls not the bodie for when it is healed there remaines a skarre but god as soone as hee exempts thee from punishment he giueth thee iustice all this is most true and much against m perkins doctrine of the infection of originall sin but nothing touching satisfaction for we hold that the soule of a sinner when he commeth to be iustified is washed whiter then snow so that there is no staine or print left in it of the filth of sinne it is also freed from all eternall punishment but not from some temporall chrysostom prooem in esaiam chrysostom speakes not of originall sinne but of dayly actuall transgressions as his whole discourse shewes which god by pardoning of them so takes away as that neither guilt nor shame of them remaines in his sight yes he makes supply of the contrary vertues to master perkins purpose they are thus to be applied that chrysostom requires nothing of him that is to be pardoned for his full release but repentance only which thing he repeates oftentimes in that proeme before esay without any the least inkling of temporall satisfaction which is almost as needfull as the other if your doctrine be true for it is in our shallow estimation as fearefull almost to fry i know not how many thousand yeares in purgatory as to be for euer in hell euerlastingnes we cannot comprehend many thousand yeares are as much as we can reach to therefore since chrysostom in that one preface so many times promiseth so full pardon and requires nothing but repentance it is more then likely he knew not your satisfaction ambrose saith i reade of peters teares but i reade not of his satisfaction now gentle reader prepare thy selfe to behold a proper peece of cousenage ambrose saith i read of peters teares but i read not of his satisfaction the colour of the craft lyeth in the ambiguity of this word satisfaction which is not alwaies taken for the penance done to satisfie for the former fault but is sometime vsed for the defence and excuse of the fact so speaketh s paul bono animo prome satisfaciam with good courage i will answere in defence of myselfe or giue you satisfaction in like manner ready alwaies to satisfie euerie one that asketh you a reason of that hope vvhich is in you in this sense doth s ambrose vse the word as is most plainly to be seene to them that reade the place and conferre it with the very like of his i find not saith he vvhat peter said but i finde that he vvept i read his teares but i read not his satisfaction but that which cannot be defended may be vvashed avvay so that nothing is more manifest then that satisfaction in this and the like places is taken for defence and excuse of his fault which peter vsed not but sought by teares and bitter vveeping to satisfie in part for it for this bevvayling of our sinnes is one speciall kind of satisfaction as saint ambrose testifieth saying that hee vvho doth penance must vvith teares vvash avvay his sinnes a man may easlyer behold malice in you that construe euery thing to the worst then cousenage in the allegation of ambrose for if your interpretation of it be neuer so true it is such as might escape a diliget reader and not be seene yes perhaps if it had not bin so prest by our me you would haue read ambrose ouer a good many times before you had dreampt of that sense bellarm de purgat lib cap bellarmine from whom you had this as the rest of your answers for the most part layes no such matter to peter martyrs charge out of whom he brings this obiection you see not more then he did but write with more spleene if master perkins had read and at the writing of this sentence remembred bellarmines answere either he would not haue alleaged it or else haue giuen some speciall reason for his allegation but this me thinks may be obserued out of this testimonie that ambros ser ambrose accounted confessing and crauing of pardon to be the satisfaction god lookes for which is alwayes performed by a sinner before he can haue any true hope that his sinnes are forgiuen this therefore going before the pardon of the eternall punishment what other satisfaction shall neede for the temporall now that ambrose in that place vnderstands by satisfaction both confessing his fault to christ whom he had offended and intreating for pardon it appeareth by these speeches and such like ambros ad luke lib cap petrus therefore peter brake out into teares intreating nothing by voyce teares wash sinnes which it is a shame to confesse teares are as it were silent prayers i finde why peter hold his peace least the crauing of pardon so soone might more offend teares are part of repentance when they come from the true griefe of the heart but not any part of satisfaction for temporall paine which we should else indure as that very sentence of ambrose prooues hee saith ambrose that repents must not only wash away his sinnes with teares but also couer and hide his former sinnes with better deeds that sinne be not laid to his charge now where sinne is not imputed there can no punishment be due and where such repentance is not there sinne is imputed euen to eternall damnation so that the teares ambrose speaketh of are parts of outward repentance for pardon of sinne not satisfaction for temporall iudgements remaining after pardon againe let vs adore christ that hee may say vnto vs feare not thy sinnes of this world nor the waues of bodily sufferings i haue remission of sinnes the other place cited out of s ambrose de bono mortis let vs adore christ that e may say vnto vs feare not thy sinnes nor the vvaues of vvorldly sufferings i haue remission of n es is rather for vs then against vs for if by adoring and seruing of god vve may be put out of feare of our sins and the punishment of them then doth it follow that praiers and such like seruice of christ doth acquit vs of sinne and satisfie for the paine due to them this adoring of christ is comming to him whereupon ensueth escaping of death as it followeth a few lines after whosoeuer saith ambros de bono mortis cap ambrose in our sauiour christs person ioh comes to me that is beleeues in me shall neuer see death by this adoring we are freed from all sinnes and all punishment due to them whereas if your doctrine of satisfaction should be receiued for all our comming to christ by faith and true repentance we might and ought stand in feare of grieuous punishment for many yeares in purgatory neither doth it follow that if by seruing god we may be put out of feare of our sinnes then such seruice doth satisfie for by true repentance we may be put out of feare of eternall damnation and yet no man will say that therefore true repentance doth satisfie for eternall paine hierome saith in psalm the sinne that is couered is not seene the sinne that is not seene is not imputed that which is not imputed is not punished to vvit vvith hellfire vvhich is the due punishment of such mortall sinne vvhereof he speaketh or sinne may bee said to bee couered when not only the fault is pardoned but all punishment also due vnto it is fully paide if it be hieronym in psalm not imputed how can it be punished for punishment is laid vpon a man in respect of sinne which he is charged with neither can any thing be iustly punished with any kind of paine eternall or temporall but only sinne your second answere is wholie for vs for if sinne be then said to be couered when the fault and the punishment are forgiuen doubtles he that is iustified is freed from both witnes rom paul and psalm lib de poenit cap dauid who auouch that iustification couers sinne and suffers it not to be imputed so doth s ambrose take that vvord couered saying the prophet calleth both them blessed as well him vvhose iniquities is forgiuen in baptisme as him vvhose sinnes are couered vvith good vvorkes for he that doth penance must not only vvash avvay his sinnes vvith teares but also with better vvorkes couer his former sinnes that they be not imputed vnto him if lib de poenit cap s ambrose take the word couered in that sense as indeed he and all man else do that speake of couering sin iustification takes away the fault and punishment of all sin so that he which is iustified needs make no farther satisfaction chrysostom on matth homily among all man some indure punishment in this life and the life to come others in this life alone others alone in the life to come others neither in this life nor in the life to come there alone as diues who was not lord so much as of one drop of water here alone the incestuous man among the corinthians neither here nor there as the apostles and prophets as also iob and therest of this kinde for they indured no sufferings for punishment but that they might bee known to be conquerours in the fight novv vve must backe againe vnto chrysostom belike he had forgotten this vvhen he cited the other or else this vvas reserued to strike it deed such excellent holy personages sufferings as are mentioned in the scriptures vvere not for their sinnes for they committed but ordinary light offences for vvhich their ordinary deuotions satisfied abundantly the great persecutions vvhich they endured vvere first to manifest the vertue and povver of god that made such fraile creatures so inuincible then to daunt the aduersaries of his truth and vvithall to animate and encourage his follovvers finally that they like conquerours triumphing ouer all the torments of this life might enter into possession of a greater revvard in the kingdome of heauen all this is good doctrine but nothing against satisfaction that their surpassing suffering vvere not for their ovvne sins and thus much in ansvvere vnto m perkins arguments against satisfaction you that are so desirous to find faults would not haue let master perkins scape without reproofe if you had lookt this place in chrysost in math homil amp chrysostom and found it to haue bin misquoted though it was most like to haue bin the printers fault in stead of answering to this testimonie you fall a discoursing of the end of the persecutions of holie man whereas many of them were not persecuted at all and chrysostom speaks generally of sufferings not of persecutions but this must be obserued in your discourse that howsoeuer you mince the matter of their ordinatie light offences yet they themselues had another opinion of their sinnes if thou lord saith psalm one of them strictly marke what is done amisse who shall stand in psalm another place one cryes to god not to enter into iudgement with his servant because in his sight no man liuing shall be iustified yes daniel that daniel beloued man daniel confesseth his owne and his peoples sinnes to god as matters that deserue no small punishment yes there is almost no mans story set downe any thing at large in the scripture that hath not some speciall sinne obserued and recorded which notwithstanding if their sufferings were not punishments to satisfie how do you teach that all sinnes must be satisfied for by vs in part obiect i leuit moses according to god commaundement prescribed seuerall sacrifices for seuerall persons and they were meanes of satisfaction for the temporall punishments of their daily sinnes answer those sacrifices were onely signes and types of christs satisfaction to be offered to his father in his alone sacrifice vpon the crosse and whosoeuer offered any sacrifice in the olde testament did thus and no otherwise esteeme of it but as a type and figure of better things secondly the said sacrifices were satisfactions to the church whereby man did testifie their repentance for their offences and likewise their desire to bee reconciled to god and man and such kinde of satisfactions wee acknowledge novv to the reasons vvhich he produceth for it and albeit he like an evil master of the campe range our arguments out of order placing that in the sore front of our side vvhich caluin presseth out against vs yet vvill i admit of it rather then breake his order how good a master of a camp soeuer he were he were of no great discretion that hauing the marshalling of his enemy battaile in his hands would not order it most for his owne aduantage but to master perkins it was all one which was first which last if you thinke him beholden to you for your kindnes he hath fully paid you in bearing with your reciting of this and diverse other his reasons moses according to god commandement prescribed seuerall sacrifices for the sins of seuerall persons and ordeined that they should be of greater and less prices according vnto the diuersitie of the sinnes whence we argue thus these mens faults vpon their true repentance ioyned vvith faith and hope in christ to come vvere pardoned therfore their charges in buying of sacrifices to be offered for them their paines and prayers in assisting during the time of the sacrifice being painefull vvorkes done to appease god iustice vvere vvorkes of satisfaction to let passe your propounding the argument otherwise then master perkins doth i answere to your enthymem by denying the consequence their sinnes say you were pardoned vpon their faith and repentance therefore their sacrifices and other painefull works were works of satisfaction it followes not for these very works were part of their repentance which without them when they could be done was insufficient and they were as requisite for the pardon of the eternall punishment i speake as you papists do as of the temporall master perkins ansvvereth many things as man do commonly vvhen they cannot vvell tell vvhat to say directly to the purpose first that those sacrifices vvere types of christs suffering on the crosse vvhat is this to the purpose how many things trow you doth master perkins answer but poore two and those more to the purpose than you would the obiection was that those sacrifices which moses prescribed seuerall persons were satisfactions for sinne this master perkins denieth directly saying that hebr they were appointed to be types of christs satisfaction which is most certaine do you aske what this is to the purpose to shew that there was another end of these sacrifices than you imagine but you will say this doth not disprooue their being for satisfaction remember your selfe master perkins answers and you replie who must prooue he or you he hath giuen you a reason of his deniall which is as much as in extremitie can bee looked for of an answerer further replie shall haue further answere secondly that those sacrifices were satisfactions to the congregation and vvhat needed that vvhen they had offended god only and not the congregation as in many offences it happeneth the sacrifices for those sins by which the congregation had not been offended were not properly for the satisfaction thereof but onely thus farre that the people might perceiue how carefull each man was to repent euen of his secret sinnes and to haue them also purged by the blood of the messiah to come whereof those sacrifices were types againe if satisfaction must be giuen to the congregation hovv much more reason is it that it be made to god read those chapters and you shall find that they vvere principally made to obtaine remission of god as these vvords also do vvitnesse and vpon that sacrifice the sinne shall be forgiuen them so that sacrifices vvere to satisfie god vvho thereupon forgaue the sinne and all paine due to it first satisfaction was made to god alreadie by the sacrifice of the messiah to come in whom they beleeued secondly there was danger to the congregation by their sin which might be an example of sinne to other thirdly the people by these sacrifices was to be taught that their sinnes prouoked the wrath of god and were to be purged by the sacrifice of the messiah there is nothing in those chapters to prooue that the end of those sacrifices was the obtaining of god mercie otherwise for temporall punishment than for eternall and i am sure you will not say they were to satisfie in that respect though vpon that sacrifice the sinne should be forgiuen that is vpon their faith and repentance of which those sacrifices were enioyned to be proofes and parts obiect man whose sinnes are all pardoned haue afterward sundrie crosses and afflictions laide vpon them vnto the ende of their daies therefore in all likelihoode they make satisfaction to god for temporall punishments as for example the israelites for murmuring against the lord in the wildernesse were barred all from the lande of promise and the like befell moses and aron for not glorifying god as they should haue done at the water of strife answer man must bee considered in a twofold estate as he is vnder the law and as he is vnder grace in the first estate all afflictions are curses or legall punishments be they little or great but to them that are in the second estate amp beleeue in christ though the same afflictions remaine yet doe they change their habite or condition and are the actions of a father seruing to be trials corrections preuentings admonitions corinthian when wee are iudged wee are nurtured of the lord and heb if we indure chastisment god offereth himselfe vnto you as children and chrysostom saith corinthian homily when wee are corrected of the lord it is more for our admonition then damnation more for a medicine then for a punishment more for a correction then for a penaltie and whereas god denied the beleeuing israelites with moses and aaron to enter into the land of canaan it cannot be prooued that it was a punishment or penaltie of the law vpon them the scripture saith no more but that it was an admonition to all man in all ages following to take heede of offences as paul writeth all these things came vnto them for ensamples and were written for our admonition corinthian the reason for vs vvhich indeed is the very ground vvorke of satisfaction may thus be framed many after pardon obtained of their sins haue had temporall punishment laide vpon them for the same sins and that by god ovvne order vvherfore after the forgiuenes of the sinne and the eternall punishment of it through christs satisfaction there remaineth some temporall paine to be endured by the party himselfe for the same sinne vvhich is most properly that vvhich vve call satisfaction they deny that any man hath been punished temporally for any sinne vvhich vvas once pardoned if this groundworke of satisfaction prooue ruinuos the whole building will quickly fall but it cannot be sound because it is deceitfully laid if by enduring temporall punishment for sinne you meane no more but that by occasion of sinne committed many man haue had such chastisements we grant your conclusion but if you vnderstand by it as the question is that they haue borne these punishments to satisfie some part of god wrath to which our sauiours sacrifice either could not or vpon composition between his father and him was not to reach we denie the antecedent of your enthymem and say that no man beleeuing in the messiah euer suffered any such punishment for sinne we proue it first by the example of the israelits vvhose murmuration against god vvas at moses intercession pardoned yet all the elder sort of them vvho had seene the miracles vvrought in egypt for their deliuerance vvere by the sentence of god depriued of the ght of the land of promise and punished vvith death in the vvildernesse for the verie same their murmuration was the eternall punishment due to this their murmuring pardoned at moses request if it were not your example is not to the purpose for our question is of them onely who haue that forgiuen if it were then al the people had true faith in the messiah which is a very bold assertion without all likelihood of truth but no doubt some of them were indeed true beleeuers they were and of them it remaines to be prooued that their shutting out of canaan was to appease the remaines of god wrath against their murmuring there is no such thing in the text but number ioa number that god did it to make all the earth see his glorie adde hereunto that this punishment was not occasioned by this sinne onely but by former murmurings and those many perhaps not at all pardoned by any such speciall entreatie of moses the like iudgement vvas giuen against moses himselfe and aaron for not glorifying gad at the vvaters of contradiction both of them had their sinne pardoned yet vvere they both aftervvard for the same de barred from the entrance into the holy land the like answere i make to the example of moses and aaron that is i denie the antecedent number moses and aaron were not punished that god might be satisfied for the temporall punishment belonging to their sinne but that they and the people might learne to put their trust in god promises made to them and to weight on him with patience the end of their punishment was not god satisfaction but their reformation and the peoples to this m perkins ansvvereth first that man must be considered in a tvvofold estate as he is vnder the lavv and as he is vnder grace in the former estate all afflictions vvere curses of the lavv in the latter they are turned vnto them that beleeue in christ from curses into trials corrections preuentions admonitions instructions and into vvhat you vvill else sauing satisfaction novv to the purpose whereas god saith he denied the beleeuing israelits vvith moses and aaron to enter into the land of canaan it cannot be proued that it vvas a punishment or penaltie of the law laide vpon them the scripture hath no more but that it vvas an admonition vnto all ages follovving to take heed of like offences as paul vvriteth all th se things came vnto them for examples and vvere vvritten for our admonition reply he that will not be ashamed of this audacious assertion needs not to care what he saith hath the scripture no more of their fact then that it was an admonition to others turne to the originall places where the whole matter in particular is related first their murmuration then moses intercession for them and the obtaining of their pardon and lastlie after all the rest god sentence of depriuation of them from entring into the land of promise for that their murmuration againe aaron shall not enter into the land because he hath been disobedient to my voyce and of moses because he hath trespassed against me at the vvaters of strife so that nothing is more cleare euen by the testimony of the holy ghost then that their daies were shortened and their hope of entrance into the land of promise cut off in punishment of those offences which were before forgiuen them and these things being recorded as s paul testifieth for our admonition and instruction we are to learne thereby that god so dea eth daily with all those sinners that he calleth to repentance master perkins denies not that this punishment was laid vpon them for those sinnes but that the scripture affoords any proofe to shew that it was a penaltie of the law as a deut part of the curse which appertaines to sinners by the law gal for which christ hath fully satisfied the punishments in themselues were penalties of the law but they are notsuch to them who by rom true faith in christ haue all their sinnes fully satisfied for by him obiect iii dauid was punished after his repentance for his adulterie for the child died and he was plagued in his owne kind in the incest of absolon and when hee had numbred the people hee was yet punished in the death of his people after his owne repentance answer i answere as before that the hand of god was vpon dauid after his repentance but yet the iudgements which befell him were not curses vnto him properly but corrections for his sinnes and triall of his faith and meanes to preuent further sinne and to renew both his faith and repentance as also they serued to admonish others in like case for dauid was a publike person and his sinnes were offensiue both within the church of god and without what dotage is this to graunt the very same thing which he would be thought to deny but yet in other tearmes that the simple whom only he can beguile may not perceiue it if the hand of god were vpon dauid correcting him for his sinne and that after his repentance did not dauid then suffer temporall punishment for his sinnes before forgiuen which is most properly to satisfie for them dauid was punished but not to satisfie god wrath remaining after the eternall punishment was taken away by the sactifice of the messiah made effectuall to dauid by his faith the reason of his punishment as sam the scripture expresly saith was the stopping of the heathen mouthes who were likely to blaspheme god because of dauids sin as if god either would not haue seene or had not cared what manner of man by his speciall prouidence he had preferred to the kingdome of israel master perkins truly and constantly denies the same thing still viz that dauids punishment was for satisfaction to god by bearing part of the curse due to sinners by the law which onely is to satisfie the reason of this deniall that i may answere once againe for all is that gal christ hath redeemed vs from the curse of the law being made a curse for vs yes ouer and beside this punishment inflicted by god he of his owne deuotion performed farre greater satisfaction by putting on sack cloath lying on the bare ground by watering his couch with teares and making ashes his food and in this most pittifull plight he made most humble supplication vnto god to wash him more and more from his iniquitie he neuer dreamed that this his satisfaction should be any derogation vnto the satisfaction of his lord and sauiour but in the psalme saith that such an humble and contrite hart is a sweete sacrifice vnto god dauid had not so little feeling either of his sauiours loue or his owne sinne as to thinke that the one had satisfied by halues or the other by such outward cariage could be satisfied for his praying and humbling of himselfe was to another end sam partly to intreate for the childs life whom he loued most dearely and partly psalm see article part article to obtaine the recouerie of that ioy and comfort which he had formerly taken in the sense of god loue to him to which he was not to be restored but vpon earnest repentance at god good pleasure we deny not but the punishment of one is a warning and admonition vnto another to take heed of the like so may not they deny but that correction is to the party himselfe as an admonition to beware afterward so a correction and punishment of the fault past which s augustine vpon this verse of the psalme thou hast loued truth teacheth most plainely saying thou hast not left their sins vvhom thou didest pardon vnpunished for thou before diddest so shevv mercy that thou mightest also preserue truth thou doest pardon him that confesseth his fault thou doest pardon him but so as he do punish himselfe and by that meanes both mercy and truth are preserued that aug ad psalm punishment of a mans self which austin speaketh of is not to make satisfaction but to shew repentance as it may well be gathered because it is ioyned to forgiuenes which can haue no place where the debt is paid if i make satisfaction god forgiues me not if god forgiue me what doe i satisfie for therefore the griefe and humiliation of a sinner is not to satisfie god that he neede not be forgiuen but to repent that hee may be forgiuen so farre is dauid from pleading satisfaction by punishing himselfe that hee intreates for pardon vpon confession of his fault because saith glossa ordin ad psalm castiodo o the glosse out of cassiodorus he had told the truth by confessing which god desires more than sacrifice therefore he intreates for helpe obiect iv the prophets of god when the people are threatned with the plague famine sword captiuitie ampc exhort them to repent and to humble themselues in sackcloth and ashes and thereby they turned away the wrath of god that was then comming forth against them therefore by temporall humiliation man may escape the temporall punishments of the lord answer famine sworde banishment the plague and other iudgements sent on god people were not properly punishments of sinne but onely the corrections of a father whereby hee humbled them that they might repent our fourth reason the prophets of god when the people were threatned with famine the sword the plague or such l ke punishments for their sinnes did commonly exhort them to works of penance as fasting prayer haire cloath and the like to appease god wrath iustly kindled against them which being performed by them god was satisfied so for example sake the niniuits at ionas preaching doing penance in sack cloath and ashes turned away the sentence of god against them m perkins answereth that famine the plague and such like scourge of god were not punishments of sins but corrections of a father reply this is most flat against a thousand expresse texts of the scripture which declare that for the transgressions of god commaundements he hath sent those punishments vpon the people of israell and what is the correction of a father but the punishing of a shrewde son for some fault committed yet in a milde sort or doth the schoolmaster which is caluins example whip the scholler or strike him with the f ula but to punish him for some fault so that great rabbins seeme not to vnderstand what they say themselues when they admit those scourges of god to be the corrections of a father but not the punishment for a fault as though fathers vsed to correct those sonnes who neuer offended them or masters to beat such scholers as commit no faults it is against neuer a one of those places if there were ten thousand of them sinne was the occasion of those punishments but they were not properly punishments for sinne to any of the people who were pardoned by resting vpon christs satisfaction through faith and manifested their true repentance by their humiliation and such is the correction of a father oftentimes perhaps more seuere than some punishment of a magistrate yet not for reuenge and satisfaction but properly for correction and admonition you much mistake the matter when you thinke we denie that they are laid vpon vs for sinne and because of your owne error condemne our writers of not vnderstanding what they say correction is for the fault but not to satisfie for it o thus they were punishments tending to correction not seruing for satisfaction but saith m perkins these punishments be tending to correction not seruing for satisfaction what senselesse ryming is this by due correction of the fault the party is satisfied in iustice and when he that hath offended doth abide such punishment as the grieuousnes of his offence did require there is both due correction of the offendour and due satisfaction vnto the party offended a professed scholler might know how to make difference between rymes amp figures of rhetorike did you neuer heare of epistrophe when the like sound is repeated in the clauses of sentences it is very like master perkins did not regard the figure but hit vpon it as it were by chance howsoeuer it is not a ryme because the vowels in the syllables which haue the accent are diverse well for the matter you answer that a punishment may be both for satisfaction and correction what then therfore these are so i denie the consequence because if i may repeate the same answere as oft as you bring the same obiection satisfaction is in this case made alreadie by christ for as many as truly beleeue in him and the punishments of god are turned from them not because they satisfie the iustice of god in their owne sufferings but because by faith they lay hold on the satisfaction of the messias and testifie the same by their humiliation and repentance as we first grant that all satisfaction hath his vertue from the grace of god dwelling in vs which is giuen vs for christs sake so to say that christs satisfaction taketh away all other satisfaction is iust to begge the principall point in question and therefore an old triuants tricke to giue that for a finall answere which was set in the beginning to be debated the answerer is not said to begge the question but the replier for to begge the questio is to take that for a proofe which is in question now it belongs not to the answerer to proue but to the replier whose person in this argument not master perkins but you sustaine looke vpon the forenamed example of the niniuits of whom it is not certaine that they had any expresse knowledge of the messias and therefore were farre enough off from laying hold on his satisfaction but most certaine and euident it is in the text that god vpon the contemplation of their workes of penance tooke compassion on them and was satisfied as by turning away the threatned subuersion is most manifest the example of the niniuites is from the purpose for if as you confesse they did not lay hold on the messiahs satisfaction how could they by this repentance of theirs applie this satisfaction of his to the purchasing of god fauour which as you taught vs before is the vse of your satisfaction secondly if they had not true saith in the messiah bellarm de poenit lib cap their eternall punishment was vnsatisfied for and we speake of that satisfaction which is made for the temporall after the eternall is discharged from this and such like examples wee may conclude that god sometimes for beares to lay outward iudgements vpon sinners regina when and because they humble themselues but that these man made satisfaction to god either by applying christs satisfaction to themselues or by redeeming the temporall punishment remaining after the pardon of the eternall or by making god amends for their former sinnes neither can it be prooued nor i thinke you vpon better aduice will affirme obiect v daniel daniel giueth this counsell to nabuchadnezar redeeme thy sinnes by iustice and thine iniquities by almes deedes behold say they almes deedes are made meanes to satisfie for mans iniquities if by such good deeds our sinnes may be redeemed as holy writ doth testifie then it followeth that such workes yeeld a sufficient satisfaction for them for redemption signifieth a full contentment of the party offended as well as satisfaction this example of nebuchadnezzar is no more to purpose than that of the niniuites for the satisfaction we dispute of cannot be performed by any but him that hath his sinnes forgiuen in respect of the eternall punishment by the satisfaction of christ such as this king at the least at this time of the prophets counsell was not answer the word which they translate to redeeme as the most learned in y e chaldie tongue with one consent auouch doth properly signifie to breake off as if the prophet should say o king thou article a mightie monarch and to inlarge thy kingdome thou hast vsed much iniustice and crueltie therefore now repent of thine iniquitie and breake off these thy sinnes testifie thy repentance by doing iustice and giue almes to the poore whom thou hast oppressed therefore here is nothing spoken of satisfaction for sinne but onely of testification of repentance by the fruites thereof to authours in the aire without any pressing of the propriety of the word no answere can be giuen either your knowledge and reading is lesse than you would haue it thought to be or you knew this answere to be true and did but shift it off that you might not seeme to be ouercome the word indeed is hebrew signifying to rub and so to breake off by rubbing it is properly spoken of cattell which being yoked rub against a tree or wall or some other hard thing till they haue fretted their yoke in sunder and so freed themselues hence is that speech of isaac to esau thou shalt rub his yoke off thy necke and from hence it is that the word signifies to redeeme or deliuer yet not by making satisfaction but by breaking the bonds in sunder servant haue ruled ouer vs saith the prophet and there is no man that rids vs out of their hands so aaron bids the people to take or breake off their eare rings viz by opening the ring by which they were fastned agreeably hereunto the prophet in this place aduiseth the king to breake off his sinnes which held him captiue and so to free himself from them and this is the first sense of the word as it appeares also in the hebrew concordance and dictionaries beside the onely way for him to escape the iudgement threatned which was temporall was to giue ouer those sins for which it was denounced in which sense hee might bee said to redeeme his sinnes in respect of the punishment to come that is to auoide and free himselfe from the euill which else would fall vpon him but let vs admit that it be broken off his sinne not being co etousnes but pride and lacke of acknowledging al kingdomes to depend vpon god as the text it selfe doth specifie to breake off this sin by almes and compassion of the poore is nothing else but by such workes of charitie in some sort to satisfie god iustice thereby to moue him to take compassion of him the chiefe sinne was pride of his owne estate the next to it and issuing from it oppression of many people of that daniel the prophet spake in expounding the vision here hee deales with him about the other willing him to practise the contrarie vertues that hee might so escape the destruction that was threatned for the prophet knew that it was possible euen for wicked man to auoide punishment denounced vpon the forsaking of their outward sinnes whereby they had prouoked the lord to vse those threatnings and that by almesdeeds we are cleansed from our sinnes our sauiour himselfe doth teach saying giue almes and behold all things are cleane vnto you that almes should be of force to clense man from their sinnes and sinnes of a different nature from the contrarie to almes giuing is a matter that hath no likelihood of truth in it and much lesse can it be proued by that place of luke s luke where our sauiour reproouing the hypocrisie of the pharisies in washing so carefully before meats as if they thought themselues otherwise cleane when they respected not what wrong they did and what extortion they vsed exhorts them rather to purge their hearts of their couetousnes and to giue to the poore and then all these outward things meate drinke and such like should bee cleane and it for them without such superstitious washing obiect vi matth doe penance and bring forth fruits worthy of penance which say they are workes of satisfaction inioyned by the priest our sixt bring forth the vvorthy fruits of penance that is doe such workes as become them who are penitent john seeing the pharisies come to his baptisme exhorts them not onely to make shew of repentance but to bring foorth fruites be seeming or worthie of them that repent the same is otherwise thus exprest act to repent and turne to god and to doe workes worthie repentance to ephesian walke worthie of their calling but for the interpretation we agree in sense which as s chrysostom expoundeth are he that hath stolen avvay another mans goods let him now giue of his owne he that hath committed fornication let him abstaine from the lavvfull company of his ovvne vvife and so forth recompensing the works of sinne with the contrary works of vertue the same exposition giueth saint gregorie and to omit all others venerable bede interpreteth them thus mortifie your sinnes by doing the worthie fruits of penance to wit by afflicting your selues so much for euery offence as vvorthy penance doth require which vvill be a sacrifice of iustice that is a most iust sacrifice so do we acknowledge the exposition which the auncients giue of it though we thinke the exhortation to be somewhat larger then they seeme in the words alleaged to make it for it comprehends all kind of holie conuersation not only the change of the grosse outward sinnes which we doubt not was their meaning also as it is manifest by chrysostom in chrysost ad math homily that place you bring who describes the repentance that he speakes of to be not only a leauing of our former sinnes but a fulfilling of good works which he proues by that place of the psalme psalm eschue euill and do good and chrysost ad math homily expounding those words bring forth fruits ampc it is not enough saith john to flie from naughtines vnlesse we betake our selues to the practice of well doing you see what he saith quote theophylact that we must not only auoid euill but also bring forth the fruit of vertue to which he addes for proofe that place of the psalme yes we refuse not that of beda ad psalm amp ad math amp ad luke bede for it is indeed a sacrifice fit for vs in iustice to offer that our repentance be answerable in proportion to our sinnes but what is all this to prooue that there remaines tempo all paine to be endured whereby god wrath may be satisfied especially when as chrysostom saith plainely that john perswading the people to repentance did it not that they might be punished but that being made humble by repenting and condemning themselues because of their sinnes they might come to the gift of pardon answer this text is absurd for the worde signifieth thus much change your mindes from sinne to god and testifie it by good workes that is by doing the duties of the morall lawe which must bee done not because they are meanes to satisfie god iustice for mans fine but because they are fruites of that faith and repentance which lies in the heart reply his answere is most absurd for we argue out of these words vvorthy fruits of penance and he answereth to the word going before repent which we vse not against them and for his glose or testifying our repentance is sufficiently confuted by the fathers before alleaged surely a reasonable man might well thinke that you that hold a necessitie of satisfaction and bring that text did ground your argument vpon iohns charge to do penance the authors alleaged do not confute that interpretation by bringing another which is not ty to it at the least we denie your consequence vpon their words and s john expresly maketh them the meanes to esca wrath of god saying that the was set to the ose of the rie and vn lesse by worthy fruits of penan they god they e vp and cast into hell fire and h confute the aying d on christs satisfaction by faith saying w l not helpe you to say th yee are the sonnes of abraham w o was her of all true beleeueis as much as if he had said trust not to your faith hand off yee generation of vipers for notwithstanding yee be the sonnes of the faithfull vnlesse yee amend your liues and for the euill works which ye haue deno tofore make recompence and satisfie the iustice of god with good y shall be cast into hell fire neither doth john speake of any satisfaction for the temporall punishment after the pardon of the eternall but threatens them with euerlasting damnation except they bring forth the fruits of repentance as well as make a profession of it by being baptised so that if satisfaction be required in those words d btles it is that satisfaction which may free them from hell fire but that you confesse is not to be performed by euery man for himselfe but by christ for all that trust in him to whom seemes he to confute the very matter of all his preaching not to beda vbi supra bede who in the place alleaged by you tels vs that john exhorts the pharises to humilitie who were so proude because they were abrahams children that they would not confesse themselues to be sinners nor to lyea at matthew lyra who writes thus because the pharises amp lawyer refused abrahams faith of christ therefore they lost the name of abrahams sonnes and certainely it had bin against reason for john to haue disswaded the saduces and pharises from trusting in christ as well because it was his especiall commission to perswade man by all meanes to beleeue in christ as also for that there was not the least cause of suspition that they would be math ioan too forward to trust in him who had so strong a perswasion of their owne righteousnes that they could find no want of his help obiect vii corinthian paul setteth downe sundrie fruites of repentance whereof the last is reuenge whereby repentant persons punish themselues thereby to satisfie god iustice for the temporall punishment of their sinnes answer a repentant sinner must take reuenge of himselfe and that is onely to vse all meanes which serue to subdue the corruption of his nature to bridle carnall affections and to mortifie sinne and these kind of actions are restrainments properly and not punishments and are directed against the sinne and not against the person the obiection with m perkins paul setteth dovvne sundry fruits of repentance vvhereof one is reuenge vvhereby repentant persons punish themselues to satisfie god iustice for the temporall punishment of their sins m perkins answereth a repentant sinner must take vengeance of himselfe and that is to vse all meanes to subdue the corruption of nature and to bridle carnall affections which kind of actions are restrainements properly but no punishments directed against the sinne but not against the person reply i neuer saw any writer so contradict himselfe and so dull that he doth not vnderstand his owne words if this subduing of our corrupt nature be restrainments only from sinne hereafter and not also punishments of sin past how then doth the repentant sinner take vengeance of himselfe which you affirme that he must doe reuenge as euery simple body knoweth is the requitall of euill past we grant that all satisfaction is directed against sinne and not against the person but for the great good of the man albeit that for a season it may afflict both his body and mind too as s paules former epistle did the corinthians if he vnderstood not his owne words he is like to haue small help of you who either cannot or will not conceiue his meaning aright the reuenge that a sinner must take of himselfe is saith master perkins to vse all good meanes which serue to subdue his corruption but this is not properly a punishment of the person against whom it is not directed but against the sinne wherein now lyes the contradiction for sooth because reuenge is a requitall of euill past therefore the sinner in his reuenge punisheth himselfe for his sinne but master perkins hath alreadie answered that the reuenge the apostle speakes of is of an other kind being directed to the reformation of the partie not to the punishing of him it is called reuenge because the corinthians vsed the same meanes for the reforming of themselues that man commonly do when they reuenge if this word reuenge would not beare this interpretation which you haue not proued nor can prooue yet were not master perkins guiltic of contradiction or not vnderstanding his owne words but only of mistaking the sense of the word but this sorrow being according vnto god doth much benefit the person as the apostle declareth for besides this reuenge taken on himselfe to appease god wrath it breedeth as it is in the text following in our corrupt nature that loueth not such chasusement a feare to returne to sinne least it be againe punished for where there is no feare of paines and much pleasure thither our corruption will runne headlong it stirreth vp also in vs indignation against sinne and all the wicked instruments of it a defence and clearing of our selues with the honester fort and an emulation and desire to she as farie from sinne as other our equals and consequently a loue of vertue and honest life which freeth vs from that sorrow and all other troublesome passions all which are plainly gathered out of the same text of saint paul let vs put the case to your liking that this reuenge was a requit all of euill past will it follow thereupon that therefore they did it to satisfie god for the temporall punishment which otherwise they were to haue indured i trow not your glossa interlin ad corinthian glosse reserres it to their care to punish sinne not to satisfie by punishing that they might shew they mislikt and hated sinne because saith the glosse you punish euen your selues when you sinne since you punish saith another lyra ad corinthian glosse your owne sinnes and especially since you punish aliena potissimum other mens but if it were for satisfaction a man would punish his owne especiallie that he might auoid a greater iudgement your ordinary glosse applies that reuenge to the sinne of the incestuous person you haue shewed saith the glossa ordin ad corinthian glosse by punishing him that committed the incest that incontaminatos you were vndefiled so doth caretan ad corinthian caietan also expound it this saith he was the last effect against the incestuous person for they vsed reuenging iustice in excommunicating him so chrysostom theophylact hieronymab chrysostom you punished them that had sinned against the lawes of god so theophylact so ierome lastly they make three works of satisfaction praier fasting and almes deedes for the first it is meere foolishnesse to thinke that man by praier can satisfie for his sinnes that praier doth appease god iustice and obtaine pardon god himselfe is witnes saying call vpon me in the day of tribulation and j will deliuer thee prayer cannot be made without saith in god power and hope in his goodnes and therfore must needs be pleasing in god sight by prayer we humble our selues before god and acknowledge his omnipotencie and our infirmity by prayer we lament with bitter teares our owne ingratitude folly and wickednes and bewaile the grieuousnes of our sinnes such prayer made king dauid as his psalmes do testify water his couch with teares making them his food day and night and by them he satisfied for his former offences so did a farre greater sinner then he king manasses who falling into tribulation prayed vnto the lord his god and did great penance before the god of his fathers and prayed and entreated earnestly and god heard his prayer and brought him backe againe to ierusalem into his kingdome god pardons sinners that call vpon him for mercie and deliuerance therefore their prayers appease his iustice there is no shew of truth in this consequence what though true prayer please god doth it therefore satisfie his iustice whom doth it not please that hee which hath offended should craue pardon yet is not this a satisfaction to iustice dauid and manasses lamented their sinnes and called vpon god for mercie but what scripture saith they satisfied for their sinnes by so doing it were an easy matter to satisfie iustice if intreating pardon would make satisfaction it is all one as if they had said that a begger by asking of almes should deserue his almes or that a debter by requesting his creditour to pardon his debt should thereby pay his debt a begger doth not deserue his almes because he makes not this former kind of prayer such as your aue maries hudled vp but the short fleight one of the protestant from the lippes outward the like we say of a debter whose creditor being a needie man will not be paid without money but god who needs none of our goodnes highly esteemeth of a humble and contri e hart grieued much for hauing sinned in the sight of god and humbly suing vnto him for pardon to such a one he said did i not forgiue thee all thy debt because thou besough est me belike then if a begger do intreat an almes from his heart by a set speach as long as one of your auemaryes he deserues that he asks if he deserue it it is small charitie to giue it and iniustice not to gide it what if the creditor be not a needy man and would be content to be paid his debt by a dayes labour which vpon the mans intreatie he releaseth also doth the detter satisfie by intreating god forgiues vpon intreatie therefore intreating makes satisfaction these loose consequences fall asunder of themselues without touching secondly fasting is a thing indifferent of the same nature with eating and drink and of it selfe conferreth nothing to the obtainement of the kingdome of heauen no more then eating and drink doth what an epicurian and fleshly doctrine is this why then did the niniuits fast put on sack cloath and lie on the ground all which bodily afflictions are reduced to fasting rather then eate and drinke and presume of god mercie if the one had bin as acceptable to god as the other why is s john baptist commended for his rough garments and thinne diet if cherishing the flesh please god as well as punishing of it christ saith expressely that if vve fast in secret his heauenly father vvill repay vs openly will he reward eating and drink so liberally but of falling we shall haue a whole chapter hereafter therefore briefely i here conclude that this doctrine tendeth to the establishment of the kingdome of atheists and epicures whose sweet speech is let vs eate and let vs drinke for after death there is no pleasure true for such belly god and th followers what a bad practise and foolish question are these of yours master perkins saith that fasting of it selfe conferres no more to the obtaining of heauen then eating doth you leaue out the principall point in reporting his opinion and then you aske why the niniuits fasted if eating be as acceptable to god you must adde of it selfe as fasting because though of it selfe it pleased not god yet as part of repentance it doth when it shewes humiliation and sorrow but they might haue fasted long inough without being humbled and haue bin neuer awhit the neerer for it but let it be granted that fasting did please god of it selfe as prayer doth will you thereupon conclude that therefore it satisfies god iustice proue the consequence john baptist is described to haue liued vpon such meate as the place where he abode did ordinarily afford but it is not said that he vsed a thin diet much lesse is he commended for it as if the thing of it selfe had pleased god it was fit for him by the extraordinarie direction of god spirit to follow such an austere course of life not to satisfie for any punishment but luke to make the israelites the more carefully attend so extraordinary a mans preaching the math reward that god will giue to them that in priuate repent of their sinnes with fasting is not because fasting of it selfe pleaseth him but for that such fasting is part of their repentance thirdly and lastly almes deedes cannot be works of satisfaction for sinnes for when wee giue them as we ought wee doe but our dutie whereunto wee are bound and we may as well say that a man by paying one debt may discharge another as to say that by doing his dutie he may satisfie god iustice for the punishment of his sinnes these we confesse be fruits of faith but yet are they no workes of satisfaction but the onely and all sufficient satisfaction made to god iustice for our sins is to bee found in the person of christ being procured by the merit of his death and his obedience and thus our doctrine touching satisfaction is cleared and it is to be learned carefully of our common people because the opinion of humane satisfaction is naturall and sticks fast in the heart of naturall man hereupon when any haue sinned and feele touch of conscience any way their manner is then to performe some outward humiliation and repentance thinking thereby to stop the mouth of conscience and by doing some ceremoniall duties to appease the wrath of god for their sinnes yes many thinke to satisfie god iustice by repeating the creede the lord prayer and the tenne commandements so foolish are they in this kinde a man might suppose that this man were pretely well seene in carolo bussone that thus ruffleth in graue matters with his simple similes if the similies were as simple as your answers to them a man should lose both his time and his labour to reade either of them shew their vnfitnes for the purpose if you can that almesdeeds redeeme our sinnes purge vs from them and make all things clean vnto vs hath bin already proued out of holy scriptures i will ioyne thereunto this one testimonie of that worthy maityr saint cyprian our frailtie could not tell vvhat to doe vulesse the goodnes of god by teaching vs the vvorkes of iustice and mercy had shevved vs a certaine vvay of preseruing our saluation which is that vvith almesdeeds we might vvash cleane avvay the filth of sins vvhich vve had contracted after baptisme the holie ghost speaketh in the scripture and saith sinnes are purged by almesdeeds and saith cyprian intending to exhort all man to almes deeds is somewhat too farre caried with his earnestnes to perswade especiallie since he ascribes to it the purging of sin whereas it can reach no farther at the vttermost by your doctrine then to satisfie for the temporall punishment his proofe prou out of scripture is not there to be found for though your vulgar translation haue it yet it is not in the originall nor in your interlin bibl arias mont chald paraphr vatablus interlinear bible nor in montanus nor in the chaldee paraphrase nor in vatablus the greek seemes to haue had it added out of the tobi apocryphall now to m perkins simile we deny that a man is bound to giue all the almes that he can we are bound to giue that which we may well spare when there is great want but almes which is a part of satisfaction is not giuen out of our superfluity but spared from our necessarie vses and is many times bestowed when there is no such great need vpon building schooles colledges hospitals and chappels and this may serue to answere m perkins similes against these three workes of satisfaction if any man desire to know why wee make speciall reckoning of these three workes it is principally for two causes first we being to satisfie must performe it with such things as be our owne which be of three sorts either they belong to our soule or to our body or to our externall goods the goods of our mind we offer to god by prayer by fasting and other bodily discipline we exhibite vnto him a liuing hoast holy and pleasing god by almesdeeds we make him an agreeable present of our goods secondly all sinne as s john teacheth may be reduced to three principall heads the concupiscence of the flesh that is heacherie which is cooled by fasting and such like afflicting of the bodie concupiscence of the eyes couetousnes which is purged and chased away by almesdeeds and pride of life which is suppressed by humble prayer and often meditation of our owne miseries when we giue almes as we ought saith master perkins we doe but our dutie you answer that we are not bound to giue all the almes we can is this to gainsay him we are bound to spare euen from our necessarie vse when the necessitie of our brother requires it he that hath no more meate than to fill his owne belly is bound to giue his brother part of it if he see him readie to starue as for other giuing when we cannot spare that wee giue and there is no necessitie it is so farre from being a satisfaction for old sins that it is a committing of new but whence comes this distinction it is not either in cyprian or in toby or that place thrust into the book of toby and out of question it was not daniels meaning that king nebuchadnezzar should giue to the poore so that he should come into want himselfe by giuing neither i thinke can you prooue it was our sauiours meaning when he exhorted the pharisies to almes deedes but doe you not perceiue that you marre all by this doctrine who will giue any thing at his death to your monasteries if he may not by giuing make some satisfaction and what satisfaction can then be made when a man giues all of superfluitie as hauing need of nothing there must be some helpe thought on for this matter or all will be naught that which followes presumes there must be satisfaction made and shewes why you thinke those the fittest meanes for to satisfie by but where the foundation is ouerthrowne what shall wee neede to thrust at the building onely i will adde here in the end of this discourse a few of many meanes for the procuring of pardon by satisfaction pope john the granted seuen hundred yeeres of pardon to euery one that should kisse three times the measure of our ladies foote as you call her and should say deuoutly three auemaries to her blessed honour and worship the measure is to be had in spayne printed together with the graunt of pardon i haue caused it to be printed and inserted in this place monstra te esse matrem sumat per te preces qui nobis n tus tulit se tuus shew thy selfe to be a mother let him by thy mediation receiue our prayers who f our sak vouchs to be th son el papa iuan concedio a quien besare esta medida tres vezos y rezare tres aue marias deuotamente a su bendito honor y reuerencia gana setecientos anos de perdon y es libre de muchos peligros teniendo la bula de la santa cruzada impressa con licencia dirigida a la deuocion del cauallero de gracia pope john the granted to euery one that shal kisse this measure three times and shall say three aue maries deuoutelie to her honour and worship to haue seuen hundred yeeres of pardon and to be free from many dangers alwaies prouided that he haue the bull of the holy cruzada printed by authoritie directed to the deuotion of the knight of grace sixtus the granted to all them that deuoutly say a short prayer beginning aue maria mater dei before the image of our ladie the summe of eleuen hundred yeeres of pardon he that shall deuoutly say that prayer obsecro te domina ampc before our ladie of pitie she will shew him her blessed visage and warne him the day and houre of his death and in his last end the angels of god shall yeeld his soule to heauen and he shall obtaine fiue hundred yeeres and so many lents of pardon granted by fiue popes enough for failing sixtus the pope to euery one being in the state of grace which must be obserued that shall say in the morning after three tellings of the aue bell three times the whole salutation of our ladie granted for euery time so doing of the spirituall treasure of holy church three hundred daies of pardon toties quoties these be fist ene oos which s briget was wont to say ampc who so say these a whele yeere shall deliuer fifteene soules out of purg of his next kinred and conuert other fifteene sinners to goodlife and other fifteene righteous man of his kinde shall perseuere in good life to all them that before this image of pitie deuoutly say fiue pater nosters and fiue aues and a credo pitiously beholding these armes of christs passion are granted thirtie two thousand seuen hundred fiftie fiue yeeres of pardon sixtus the made the fourth and fifth prayers and hath caused his pardon to be bulled fol a daies for deadly sinnes yeares done bulled his foresaid pardon john the hath granted to all that deuoutly say this prayer after the eleuation of our lord iesus christ three thousand daies of pardon for deadly sinnes boniface the granted tenne thousand yeeres of pardon vpon the saying of another prayer betweene the eleuation and the three agnus deis sixtus the hath granted to all them that be in the state of grace saying this prayer following immediatly after the eleuation of the bodie of our lord cleane remission of all their sinnes perpetually enduring and john the hath granted to all them that deuoutly say the same prayer before the image of our lord crucified as many daies of pardon as there were wounds in the bodie of our lord in of the time of his bitter passion the which were who that deuoutly say these prayers shall obtaine tenne hundred thousand yeeres of pardon for deadly sinnes granted by john the who that deuoutly with a contrite heart daily say this orison if he be that day in the state of eternall damnation then this eternall paine shall be changed him into temporall paine of purgatorie then if he haue deserued the paine of purgatorie it shall be forgotten and forgiuen thorough the infinite mercie of god but that i may not tire the reader and make him cast his gorge at such abominations which are popish satisfactions for sinnes i will giue you a view of the number of yeeres for which pardon is graunted in this one booke viz yet purgatorie is to last no longer then the vvorld but now to knit vp this question let vs heare briefly what the best learned and purest antiquity hath taught of this satisfaction done by man and because m perkins began with tertullian omitting his auncients let vs first heare what he saith of it in his booke of penance hovv foolish is it saith he not to fulfill our penance and yet to expect pardon of our sinnes this is not to tender the price and yet to put out a hand for the revvard for god hath decreed to set the pardon at this price he proposeth impunity to be redeemed vvith this recompence of penance this is but a tricke to make a shew as if master perkins had omitted some ancienter than tertullian which else you could haue alleaged but who is so little acquainted with your courses that he knowes not we haue here the best you can bring tertullian as the ancient writers generally speakes of repentance without which it is vnreasonable and vaine to looke for pardon now whereas they mention and vrge oftentimes the outward workes it was because without them neither the church could be satisfied and man would easily deceiue themselues with an opinion of repentance or at the most with some slight thinking vpon and grieuing for their sinnes this appeares in tertull de poenit cap that very place immediatly after therefore if they that sell first trie the coyne which they are to receiue that it be not clipt nor washt nor countenfeit we may well thinke that god will first make triall of the repentance especially since he is to grant vs so great a reward of eternall life but let vs deferre the truth of repentance a while by which words it is plaine that tertullian speakes of testifying our repentance to be true by those outward signes of it which doe ordinarily accompanie it where it is true his equall in standing and better in learning origin thus discourseth see our good lord tempering mercy vvith seuerity and vveighing the measure of the punishment in a iust and mercifull balance he deliuereth not vp a sinner for euer but looke hovv long time thou knovvest thy selfe to haue offended so long doe thou humble thy selfe to god and satisfie him in the confession of penance that which i answered before of tertullian is made good by this place of origin that repentance is the satisfaction they required looke not saith origin homily ad iudic origin immediatly vpon the former words that chusarsacon should humble thee and necessitie driue thee spight of thy teeth to repentance but preuent thou this tormentors hands because if thou amend and correct thy selfe god is pitifull and mercifull who will temper reuenge toward him that hath preuented it by repentance so that it is not satisfaction but amendment that god lookes for that glorious martyr and most learned arch bishop s cyprian is vvonderfull vehement against them that vvould not haue seuere penance done by such as fel in persecution saying that such indiscreet man labour tooth and nayle that satisfaction be not done to god highly offended against the and saith further that he who withdraweth our brother from these workes of satisfaction doth miserably deceiue them causing them that might doe true penance and satisfie god their mercifull father vvith their prayer and vvorkes to perish dayly and to be more and more seduced to their further damnation the former testimony out of cyprian epistle cyprian is falsely alleaged the words are these our brotherhood is deceiued by certaine amongst you who while they desired to be plausible without regard of restoring salutis health doe more hurt them that are fallen there is no word of satisfaction to god the case was this certaine christians had fallen from the profession of religion in time of persecution who were restored to the enioying of the word and sacraments before they had sufficiently repented and testified their repentance to the congregation by this presumption and rashnes in receiuing these man the honour of the martyrs shame of the confessors and the peace of all the people as cyprian saith were disturbed he therefore writ this epistle against that bad practise of admitting them that had denied christ to the sacrament before either the church were satisfied or these man had repented toward god as was meete whereby it came to passe that whereas by being held out they might haue been brought to true repentance by this hastie receiuing of them they made light of their grieuous sinnes and remained in state of damnation which is the very thing that cyprian affirmes in the other testimonie which followes in the same epistle presently after the amplifying of the sinne by certaine places of scripture s basil saith looke to thy selfe that according to the proportion of thy fault thou maist hence also borrovv some helpe of recouering thy health is it a great and grieuous offence it hath then need of much confession bitter teares a sharpe combat of vvatching and vncessant and continued fasting if the offence vvere light and more tollerabte yet let the penance be equall vnto it basil in illa verba attende tibi basil saith no more than we grant that our repentance must be proportionable to our sinne if you gather from thence that we must satisfie god therby i deny your consequence the end is that wee may become more carefull of sinning and more truly humbled to increase our thankfulnes to god for pardoning vs s gregory nazianzen saith it is as great an euill to pardon vvithout some punishment as to punish vvithout all pittie for as that doth loose the bridle to all licentiousnes so this doth straine it too much by compassion on the poore and faith sinnes are purged therefore let vs be cleansed by this compassion let vs scoure out the spots and filth of our soules vvith this egregious herbe that makes it vvhite some as vvoole others as snovv according to the proportion of euery mans compassion and almes nazianzen ratione in sancta lumina nazianzens end of requiring punishment as himselfe makes it plaine is the restraining of vs from sinning but this prooues not that wee can or must satisfie for the temporall punishment of our sinnes to god for this effect may easily be wrought in vs though wee be not pu t vp with a conceit of our abilitie to satisfie what is it that should encourage vs but hope of immunitie but neither do we promise nor can any man looke for freedome in this case for though god looke not for any further satisfaction than our sauiour christ hath made him yet he will chastice our sins sharply for example to other man and our owne amendement his other nazianzen de pauper amore speach is an earnest exhortation to compassion and mercy and as sixtus senensis hath taught vs may not be prest to the vttermost there is no doubt but god likes of mercy and pitie on the poore very highly and rewards it with increase of grace euen in this life by which we may be said to finde fauour with god for the auoiding of diverse chastisements not because of their worth but for that the lord by them gratiously takes knowledge that we haue a desire and care to please him s ambrose saith vve haue many helpes vvhereby we may redeeme our sinnes ast thou money redeeme thy sinne not that our lord is to be bought and so but thou thy selfe article sold by thy sinnes redeeme thy selfe vvith thy vvorkes redeeme thee vvith thy money ambros de elia amp ieiunio cap ambrose hauing taught before that being redeemed by the blood of christ we are not to haue to do with the works of the deuill and that if we do sinne he that once hath pardoned vs will not remember the wrongs we haue done him proceeds to exhort vs to the redeeming or satisfying for our sinnes by all outward meanes of true repentance and namely by vsing well the goods that god hath bestowed on vs he that will presse this by the word may vrge satisfaction for sinne by it not only for punishment redeeme thy sinne beside you told vs before that satisfaction is not made but by that which is spared from our necessarie vses ambrose here speakes of abundance make saith he of the instrument of co etousnes a help of mercy and he brings that out of the prou d b p epistle prouerbs though misaplied a mans riches are his redemption and hovv could vve be saued vnlesse vve washed away our sinnes by fasting ambros epistle the other testimonie also speakes of washing away not satisfying for the punishment due to it in purgatory he that will reade the place and see the weake proofes that are brought for it will not greatly rely vpon the authoritie of the writer in that case yet i had rather expound this and such like passage of repentance so testified and assured to our selues and god then of satisfaction s hierom maketh paula a blessed matron say my face is to be dissigured which against the commandement of god i painted my body is to be afflicted that hath taken so great pleasure my often laughter is to be recompenced vvith continuall vveeping my silkes and soft cloathing it to be chaunged into rough haire the like may be said to that of hieron ad eustoch de obitu paulae ierome and this beside that paula had now resolued as it followeth in that place to giue hir selfe to please christ and not the world which she could not well doe if she continued in the vanities thereof read another epistle of his to the same eustochium about the preseruing of her virginity and see what penance himselfe did being a most vertuous young man as for the penance as you call it that ierome himselfe did it was not to satisfie god wrath for his sinnes but to subdue his owne corrupt affections which makes me the rather so expound the former of paula i subdued saith he hieron ad eustoch de virginit in that place the rebelling flesh by fasting diverse weekes and afterward if they suffer this that is as the place shewes if they be so tempted who their body being consumed are assaulted by thoughts only what temptations is a virgin subiect to who liues in the abundance of delights yes ieromes whole epistle to hir perswades to the auoyding of courtly temptations by the forsaking of the place of danger not to satisfaction by penance s augustine saith he that is truly penitent lookes to nothing else then that he leaues not vnpunished the sinne vvhich he committed for by that meanes not sparing our selues he vvhose high and iust iudgment no contemtuous person can escape doth spare vs the argument of the aug epistle ad macedonia epistle to macedonius is the anowing of the priests praying for them who hauing sinned promise ecclesiasticall penance the clause you alleage out of it makes nothing against vs who confesse that our looking into our owne faults and condemning our selues for them and if you will afflicting our minds and body to became we haue offended is many times an occasion that god withholds his hand from shiking for his end being our reformation by the sight of our sinne and his iudgement due vnto it in the nature of the thing when this effect is alreadie wrought in vs to what purpose should god draw his sword to chastice and he sheweth how that a penitent sinner doth come to the priest and receiue of him the measure of his satisfaction the very beginning of the aug lib homily homil cap xi homily sheweth that it is true repentance austin there intreates of because he proues the necessitie and profit of that which he there requires by those places of scripture which vrge humiliation and amplifies the parable of the publican who was iustified in his humilitie rather then the pharisie though he fasted twice a weeke and gaue tithes of all that he possessed the end of comming to the priest austin makes this that he may iudge whether the sinne require any publike satisfaction to be made to the church or no that if his sinne saith austin be not only to his great hurt but also to the offence of other and it seeme expedient to the priest for the benefit of the church he may not refuse to do penance before many or euen before the whole multitude and not by shamefastnes adde pride to the deadly sore and he saith directly against our protestant position that it is not sufficient to amend our manners and to depart from the euill vvhich vve haue committed vnlesse we do also satisfie god for those things which vve had done how is this testimonie of aug homily cap austin against our position do we say it is inough to leaue sinne though we sorrow not for it nay do we not teach that no man can leaue that sin for which he is not truly and hartily grieued vnlesse perchance he change one sinne into another the satisfaction that god requires is that which austin there describes out of the psalm psalme the sacrifice to god is a troubled spirit an humble and contrite heart god will not despise this is all that the prophet whom he alleageth requires in that place austin addes almes which we willingly acknowledge as a sacrifice greatly pleasing god and fit to testifie true repentance that hauing found mercy at god hands we may also shew mercy to other s gregorie saith that sinnes are not only to be confessed but to be blotted out with the austerity of penance what saith gregor lib cap in regina in psalm gregory more then i haue oft acknowledged that we may not thinke it sufficient to confesse we haue sinned but must also bewaile our sinnes committed i will close vp these testimonies with this sentence of our learned country man venerable bede delight saith he or desire to sinne vvhen we doe satisfaction is lightly purged by almesdeeds and such like but consent is not rubbed out vvithout great penance novv custome of sinning is not taken avvay but by a iust and heauie satisfaction you were ashamed to set downe beades proofe of these three points least the weakenes of his reasons might lighten the waight of his authoritie delight in sinne saith beda in psalm bede is likened to iairus daughter who was raised to life by the touching of her hand he forgot that christ bad her rise so is that purged by almes and such like light satisfaction consent is signified by the yong man that was carying out to be buried and is not wiped out but by heauie penance will you heare his proofe for our lord doth not reach out his hand to him but saith to him as it were pulsu amp grauitate with a certaine mouing of him and grauitie yong man i say vnto thee arise by lazarus hauing lien foure dayes in the graue and stincking both the simple act and the custome of sinning is signified which is not taken away and pardoned but by a right and heauie satisfaction which is vnderstood by the lowdnes of our lord voyce and his groning in spirit at the raising of him as weake as this groundworke is to beare so waightie a building we will not offer to push at it if you will giue vs leaue to make that reasonable interpretation which i haue prooued to be intended by diverse of beades auncients that he meanes only to teach vs that as sinnes differ in heinousnes so must our ret entance in waight and measure if this like you not whatsoeuer damage this worke of beade shall haue the fault shall be yours wholie and not ours at all and if you please in few words to heare the protestant works of penance and satisfaction insteed of our fasting and other corporall correction they fall to eating and that of the best flesh they can get and take in the lord all such bodely pleasure as the company of a woman will afford in lieu of giuing almes to the poore they pill them by fines and vnreasonable rents and by vsury and crafty bargaines are not ashamed to cousen their nearest kinne finally in place of prayer and washing away their owne sins by many bitter teares they sing meerely a geneua psalme and raile or heare a railing at our imagined sinnes or pretended errors and so leaue and lay all paine and sorrow vpon christs shoulders thinking themselues belike to be borne to pleasure and pastime and to make merry in this world this spitefull and slanderous inuectiue of yours sauouring neither of conscience nor ciuilitie whereby you charge your soueraigne his counsailers nobles gentrie and all that any where in sinceritie professe the gospell of iesus christ with flat epicurisme i wittingly omit holding it more christian like to be railed vpon without cause then to raile vpon desert we vse our libertie with moderation how you priests and iesuits obserue that which feare of damnation hope of reward the lawes of your superiors and your owne vowes bind you to i had rather euery man should iudge according to his knowledge then suspect by my reporting of that which would not seeme very vnlikely traditions are doctrines deliuered from hand to hand either by word of mouth or by writing beside the written word of god conclus i wee hold that the very worde of god hath beene deliuered by tradition for first god reuealed his will to adam by word of mouth and renewed the same vnto the patriarkes not by writing but by speech by dreames and other inspirations and thus the worde of god went from man to man for the space of two thousand and foure hundred yeeres vnto the time of moses who was the first penman of holy scripture for as touching the prophesie of enoch we commonly holde it was not penned by enoch but by some iew vnder his name and for the space of this time man worshipped god and helde the articles of their faith by tradition not from man but immediately from god himselfe and the historie of the new testament as some say for eightie yeeres as some others thinke for the space of twenty yeeres and more went from hand to hand by tradition till penned by the apostles or being penned by others was approoued by them hitherto we agree but not in this which he interlaceth that in the state of nature euery man was instructed of god immediately in both matters of faith and religion for that god then as euer since vsed the ministerie aswell of good fathers as godly masters as enoch noe abraham and such like to teach their children and servant the true worship of god and true faith in him otherwise how should the word of god passe by tradition from adam to moses as m perkins affirmeth if no child learned any such thing of his father but was taught immediately from god but m perkins seemeth to regard l tle such petty contradictions if you were not more desirous to pick quarrels then to acknowledge truth you would neuer faine such contradictions master perkins sayes no such thing as you charge him with but speakes only of the patriarks by whose ministerie the rest were taught as he shewes idolatry of the later times otherwhere making it an argument to perswade housholders to the like dutie conclus ii we hold that the prophets our sauiour christ and his apostles spake and did many things good and true which were not written in the scriptures but either came to vs or to our ancetours onely by tradition as tim it is said that iannes and iambres were the magitians that withstood moses now in the books of the olde testament wee shall not finde them once named and therefore it is like that the apostle had their names by tradition or by some writings then extant among the iewes so hebr the author of the epistle recordeth of moses that when he saw a terrible sight in mount sinai he said i tremble and am afraide which words are not to be found in all the bookes of the old testament in the epistle of iude mention is made that the diuell stroue with michael the archangell about the bodie of moses which point as also the former considering it is not to be found in holy writ it seemes the apostle had it by tradition from the iewes that the prophet esai was killed with a fullers clubbe is receiued for truth but yet not recorded in scripture and so likewise that the virgin mary liued and died a virgin and in ecclesiasticall writers many worthy sayings of the apostles and other holy man are recorded and receiued of vs for truth which neuerthelesse are not set downe in the bookes of the olde or new testament and many things wee holde for truth not written in the worde if they bee not against the word his conclus we hold that the prophets our sauiour christ and his apostles spake and did many things good and true which were not written in the scriptures but came to vs by tradition but these were not necessary to be beleeued for one example he puts that the blessed virgin marie liued and died a virgin but it is necessary to saluation to beleeue this for heluidius is esteemed by s augustine an heretike for denying it de haeres ad quod lib master perkins saith nothing of the necessitie of beleeuing that point of the virgin maries perpetuall virginitie we hold to be true but we dare not lay a burthen vpon any mans conscience where the scripture is silent s austins iudgement though he were a singular light of the church is not of waight inough to determine without all warrant of scripture what is heresie and what is not especially since in praefat de haeres b himselfe confesseth that it cannot at all or very hardly be declared regulari definitione by a lawful definition what makes a man an heretike besides austin thus deliuers the matter concerning the heluidians heresie the heluidians saith he so gaine said the virginitie of mary that they confidentlie affirme she had other children after christ by her husband ioseph so that it may well be austin counted them heretikes especially for auouching that peremptorily which they could no way make good by scripture conclus iii we hold that the church of god hath power to prescribe ordinances rules or traditions touching time and place of god worship and touching order and comelines to bee vsed in the same and in this regard paul corinthian commendeth the church of corinthian for keeping his traditions and act the counceil at lerusalem decreed that the churches of the gentiles should abstaine from blood and from things strangled this decree is tearmed a tradition and it was in force among them so long as the offence of the iewes remained and this kinde of traditions whether made by generall councels or particular synods we haue care to maintaine and obserue these caueats being remembred first that they prescribe nothing childish or absurd to be done see what a erent opinion this man carrieth of the church of god gouerned by his holy spirit that it neuerthelesse may prescribe things both childish and absurd but i must pardon him because he speaketh of his owne synagogue which is no part of the true church hee that obserues what your roman synagogue hath brought into god seruice and remembers that the church that is man which beare sway in it may fondly erre will acknowledge this caueat most needfull no stage play is so full of fooleries as your masse game secondly that they bee not imposed as any parts of god worship this is contrary to the conclusion for order and comlinesse to be vsed in god worship which the church can prescribe is some part of the worship order and comelinesse are no parts of god worship but adiuncts seruing to the better performance thereof as the obseruation of due and fit circumstances giue a grace and furtherance to any action whatsoeuer thirdly that they be seuered from superstition or opinion of merit this is needlesse for if it be not absurd which was the first prouiso it is already seneted from superstition that is absurd which is contrarie to common reason or sense but all things superstitious are not so yes many points of superstition haue so much shew of reason for them that without god commandement to the contrarie a wise man might thinke them very fit meanes of god worship and meritorious such column was y e gentiles worshipping of angels supposing they had worshipped none but god such is your worshipping of angels and he saincts and she saincts now adayes such is your feare of displeasing god if you eate flesh on saincts eauens or in lent and such like lastly that the church of god be not burdened with the multitude of them and thus much wee hold touching traditions the fourth touching multitude may passe these be but meere trifles that is of more importance that he tearmeth the decree registred in the of the actes of the apostles a tradition whereas before he defined traditions to be all doctrine deliuered besides the written word now the actes of the apostles is a parcell of the written word as all the world knovves that then vvhich is of record there cannot be tearmed a tradition though the acts of the apostles be a part of the written word yet was not the booke written when that decree was first obserued neither doth master perkins giue it the name of himselfe but saith it is tearmed a tradition papists teach that beside the written worde there be certaine vnwritten traditions which must bee beleeued as profitable and necessarie to saluation and these they say are twofold apostolicall namely such as were deliuered by the apostles and not written and ecclesiasticall which the church decreeth as occasion is offered wee hold that the scriptures are most perfect containing in them all doctrines needfull to saluation whether they concerne faith or manners and therefore we acknowledge no such traditions beside the written worde which shall bee necessarie to saluation so as hee which beleeueth them not cannot be saued before we come to the protestant reasons against traditions obserue that we deuide traditions into three sorts the first we rearme diuine because they were deliuered by our blessed sauiour who is god thesecond apostolicall as deliuered by the holy apostles the third ecclesiasticall instituted and deliuered by the gouernors of the curch after the apostles daies and of these three kinds of traditions we make the same account as of the writings of the same authors to wit we esteeme no lesse of our sauiours traditions than of thefoure gospels or any thing immediatly dictated from the holy ghost likewise as much honor and credit doe we giue vnto the apostles doctrine vnwritten as written for incke and paper brought no new holines nor gaue any force and vertue vnto either god or the apostles words but they were of the same value and credit vttered by word of mouth as if they had been written here the question is principally of diuine traditions which we hold to be necessary to saluation to resolue and determine many matters of greater difficulty for we deny not but that some such principall points of our faith which the simple are bound to beleeue vnder paine of damnation may be gathered out of the holy scriptures as for example that god is the creator of the world christ the redeemer of the world the holy ghost the sanctifier and other such like articles of the creed diuine traditions are such as were deliuered by our sauiour say you and are diverse from those that the apostles left so that the controuersie is principally of those matters that christ only spake and neither the euangelists nor apostles haue set downe in writing but that we may vnderstand what wee doe it is further to be knowne that the question is not whether if there be any such traditions wee are bound to beleeue them for that is out of all doubt but whether there be any such or no or whether the scriptures doe not containe sufficient direction for the determining of al matters of importance to saluation and for the substance of religion you that you may discredit the scriptures to aduance traditions doe not so much as acknowledge that the maine grounds of doctrine are there plainly taught but mince the matter with your some such principall points and may be gathered out of the holy scripture whereas not onely those two you name but if not all yet many more are manifestly therein declared testimonie i deutr thou shalt not adde to the words that i commande thee nor take anything therefrom therefore the written worde is sufficient for all doctrines pertaining to saluation if it bee said that this commandement is spoken as well of the vnwritten as of the written word i answere that moses speaketh of the written word onely for these very words are a certaine preface which hee set before a long commentarie made of the written lawe for this ende to make the people more attentiue and obedient let the words be set where you will they must not be wrested beyond their proper signification the words cited signifie no more then that we must not either by addition or subtraction chaunge or peruert god commaundements whether they be written or vnwritten to interpret deut this place of vnwritten traditions is to marc strengthen the iewes error and to voide our sauiours reproofe and if there were any such though the particulars were not to be recorded yet it is strange that moses should not once make mention of them in generall thomas q article ad primum thomas expounds it of adding to the words of the scripture and if it be lawful for all these prohibitions to adde other doctrines why doth chrysost ad mat homily chrysostom reprooue the iewish priests for hauing added many things to the law though moses with threatning charged them they should not for it is certaine they neuer added to nor any way corrupted the text but chrysostom accuseth them of adding because they deliuered doctrines that were not written in the scripture as math our sauiour also saith of them cardinall caietan ad deut caietan wils vs to gather from this place that the law of god is perfect now to inferre that because they are as a preface vnto moses lavv that therefore nothing must be added vnto the same law is extreame dotage what is it to refute that which your aduersarie saith not master perkins proues that moses spake of the written law because he sets it as a preface before his commentarie vpon the same law you answere nothing to that but crie out vpon extreame dotage for inferrring that because it is a preface to moses law therefore nothing must be added to it who inferres any such matter but your selfe you need not make worke you haue your hands full why then were the bookes of the old testament written aftervvard if god had forbidden any more to be written or taught besides that one booke of deuteronomie shall we thinke that none of the prophets that liued and wrote many volumes after this had read these vvords or that they either vnderstood them not or that vnderstanding them vvell did vvilfully transgresse against them one of these the protestant must needs defend or else for very shame surcease the alleadging of this text for the all sufficiencie of the written vvord we neither need nor will defend either of them but we denie your consequence if no man might adde any thing to the law of god deliuered by moses then the prophets offended in writing so many volumes the reason is that the prophets writ not as man but as pet the instruments of god spirit inditing and penning by them god did not tie his owne hands by that commandement that he might not from time to time instruct his people as it should seeme good to his infinite wisedome to speake yet more plainly the prophets and apostles writings are nothing els but expositions of that the summe whereof is deliuered in the fiue bookes of moses wherein the whole doctrine of the law and the gospell is contained testimonie ii isai to the law and to the testimonie if they speake not according to this worde it is because there is no light in them here the prophet teacheth what must be done in cases of difficultie man must not runne to the wizard or southsaier but to the law and testimonie and here he commends the written word as sufficient to resolue all doubts and scruples in conscience whatsoeuer here the prophet teacheth saith m perkins vvhat is to be done in cases of difficulty man must not runne to the wizards and soothsayers but to the lavve and to the testament commending the vvritten vvord as sufficient to resolue all doubts by the lavv and testimony in that place the fiue books of moses are to be vnderstood if that written word be sufficient to resolue all doubts vvhatsoeuer what need vve then the prophets vvhat need vve the euangelists and the epistles of the apostles what wizard vvould haue reasoned in such sort the scripture is not to resolue all doubts but all doubts and scruples of conscience whatsoeuer which you craftily leaue out in propounding our reason your consequence is false if the fiue bookes of moses be sufficient for the resoluing of al doubts what need any writings of the prophets euangelists or apostles is not the ciuill and canon law in your iudgement sufficient to resolue all doubts in cases concerning them is there therefore no need of any exposition thereof the rest of the scripture is a commentarie vpon those fiue bookes besides is nothing required in the scripture but resoluing of doubts the historie of the church is worth the knowing for our instruction comfort exhortation imitation and such like the prophet vvilleth there that the israelites vvho vvanted vvit to discerne vvhether it be better to flie vnto god for counsell than vnto wizards and sooth sayers to see vvhat is vvritten in the lavv of moses concerning that point of consulting wizards vvhich is there plainely forbidden in diverse places novv out of one particular case vvhereof there is expresse mention in the vvritten vvord to conclude that all doubts and scruples vvhatsoeuer are thereby to be decided is a most vnskilfull part arguing as great vvant of light in him as vvas in those blind israelites the prophet doth not send them to the law and to the testimonie to see whether it be lawful to enquire of soothsayers or no but tels them that they must looke into the booke of god to see whether such iudgements as the prophets threatned should not befall them if they continued their sinning against god so that hee wils them not to hearken what the southsayers say of their escaping the iudgements that the prophets denounced but to trie whether their promises of safetie or the others threatning of destruction were agreeable to the word of god though the case be particular which you put amisse yet if the triall of the prophets doctrine be to be made by the scripture as it is wherein may we looke to vnwritten traditions testimonie iii john these things were written that ye might beleeue that iesus is the christ and in beleeuing might haue euerlasting life here is set downe the full end of the gospell and of the whole written word which is to bring man to faith and consequently to saluation and therefore the whole scripture alone is sufficient to this ende without traditions testimony ioh these things vvere vvritten that yee might beleeue that iesus is the christ and in beleeuing might haue life euerlasting here is set dovvne the full end of the gospell that is to bring man to faith and consequently to saluation to vvhich the vvhole scripture alone is sufficient vvithout traditions ans here are more faults than lines first the text is craftily mangled things being put in steed of miracle for s john saith many other miracles christ did ampc but these vvere vvritten ampc mangling is cutting off some part not putting one word for another especially such a word as containes the other things comprehends both doings and sayings and to both doth one of your glosses referre this narration euen on the former verse where the word miracle is set downe he shewes saith i yes ad ioa lyra the insufficiencie of the scripture in respect of christs excellencie in opere amp doctrina in worke and doctrine secondly s john saith not that for faith vve shall be saued but beleeuing vve should haue saluation in his name vvhich he clipped off what saith master perkins more than glossa ordin ibi your glosse doth acknowledge that faith may be anowed by which life may be had and lyra ibi another glosse expounds that beleeuing of faith formed by charitie which you grant iustifies it helpes vs nothing at all to leaue out those words in his name and therefore there was no clipping in it thirdly remember to vvhat faith s john ascribes the meanes of our saluation not to that vvhereby vve applie vnto our selues christs righteousnes but by vvhich vve beleeue jesus to be christ the messias of the ievves and the son of god vvhich m perkins also concealed the faith spoken of in this text is not properly iustifying faith but that is signified in the latter part of the verse where it is said that we haue life in his name that is by resting vpon his power to saue vs the concealing of those words doth more hurt than helpe vs if it bee said that this place must bee vnderstood of christs miracles onely i answere that miracles without the doctrine of christ and knowledge of his sufferings can bring no man to life euerlasting and therefore the place must bee vnderstood of the doctrine of christ and not of his miracles alone as paul teacheth gal if we or an angell from heauen preach vnto you any thing beside that which wee haue preached let him bee accursed and to this effect hee blames them that taught but a diverse doctrine to that which he had taught tim novv to the present matter s john saith that these miracles recorded in his gospell vvere vvritten that vve might beleeue iesus to be the son of god and beleeuing haue saluation in his name ampc therefore the vvritten vvord containes all doctrine necessary to saluation ans s john speaks not a word of doctrine but of miracles and therfore to conclude sufficiencie of doctrine out of him is not to care vvhat one saith but m perkins foreseeing this saith it cannot be vnderstood of miracles only for miracles vvithout the doctrine of christ can bring no man to life euerlasting true and therefore that text speaking only of miracles proueth nothing for the sufficiency of the vvritten word christs miracles vvere sufficient to proue him to be the son of god and their messias but that proueth not s iohns gospell to containe all doctrine needfull to saluation for many other points of faith must be beleeued also master perkins prooues that the euangelist speakes not only of miracles because he speakes of such a faith as will bring a man to euerlasting life which the faith that comes by miracles only will not doe you offer not to answere his reason which stands still in force against you but denie the conclusion that he speakes not onely of miracles this reason wee haue confirmed as also the interpretation by that place of austin john the euangelist saith tractat in ioan ustin witnesseth that our lord christ both said and did many things that are not written but those things were chosen out to be written which seemed sufficient for the saluation of the beleeuers and whereas you would restraine the text only to the proofe of christs being the messiah lyra ibi lyra may teach you that in this epilogo conclusion the profit also of the doctrine is declared and hugo ibi hugo cardinalis saith that in these words specially the intent of the booke but generally the end of all the scripture is declared now the end of the scripture is our saluation to the same purpose writes cyrill in ioa lib cap cyrill all things that our lord did are not written but those that the writers thought to be sufficient for manners and doctrine that we glistering with true faith good workes and vertue might come to the kingdome of heauen and if it alone be sufficient vvhat neede vve the other three gospels the actes of the apostles or any of their epistles or the same s johns reuelations there are some that thinke and the opinion is not vnlikely that the euangelist speakes of all the bookes of the new testament which hee saw before his writing of this gospell vnlesse perhaps the reuelation were penned by him afterward but the obiection shewes it selfe to be vaine by my former answer to the like about the fiue bookes of moses finally admit that s johns gospell vvere all sufficient yet should not traditions be excluded for christ saith in it in plaine tearmes ioh that he had much more to say vnto his apostles but they as then being not able to beare it he reserueth that to be deliuered vnto them aftervvard of vvhich high mysteries s john recordeth not much in his gospell after christs resurrection and so many of them must needs be deliuered by tradition vnvvritten first if it be granted that ioh our sauiour had at that time some new matter to deliuer which they had not heard of what get you by it it will not follow thereupon either that all things necessarie to saluation are not contained in the scriptures or that your traditions are the things that our sauiour meant for as tract i ioan austin truly affirmeth since christ hath not signified any where in scripture what they were it is rashnes for any man to presume to say they were such or such things no man saith your glossa interlin ibi glosse may determine what they were secondly there is no shew of consequence in your reasoning christ had many things to say not long before his death therefore though the gospell be all sufficient yet there are many things not written which were needfull to be beleeued because they were afterward to be spoken therefore were they not written at all by the apostles and euangelists sure christ forbad not the writing of them in those words thirdly this is the place which heretikes abuse to the countenancing of their traditions as you do of yours all foolish heretikes saith aug tract in ioan austin that will haue themselues counted christians indeuour to colour their bold fantasticall inuentions with that sentence of the gospell i haue yet many things to say to you lastly i answere that those many things of which christ speakes were the same that before he had taught them which they partly vnderstood not and partly remembred not i prooue it thus our sauiour said before that he john had taught them all things which he had heard of his father and promised to send them the holie ghost john that should teach them and cause them to remember whatsoeuer he had said to them whereof we haue a worthie example in ioan that speech of christ concerning building the temple againe this saith the gospell the disciples then vnderstood not but after his resurrection they came to the true vnderstanding of it we say not that our sauiour deliuered to them euery point of doctrine distinctly but that he furnished them with so much knowledge as that they might easily by that light gather and write whatsoeuer was needfull to be beleeued to the penning whereof they had the speciall direction of the spirit both for matter and maner iansen ad ioan iansenius bishop of gaunt is wholie of the same opinion affirming that those many things were not diverse from those which he had taught them before but a more plaine exposition of them and to that purpose he alleages very fitly that place of the corinthian apostle i could not speake to you as vnto spirituall man but as it were vnto carnall man to little ones in christ didymus apud tho in caten ad ioa didymus about the yeare expounded the place thus this he saith that his auditors omnia verborum consecuti had not yet conceiued all things which he had told them that afterward they were to suffer for his name sake and afterward as yet also saith didymus being vnder the type of the law and shadowes they could not discerne of the truth the shadow whereof the law caryed this place of s john m perkins patcheth vp vvith another of s paul if vve or any angell from heauen preach vnto you any thing besides that gal vvhich we haue preached let him be accursed and to this effect he blames them that taught but a diverse doctrine to that vvhich he had taught tim ans now we must looke vnto the gentlemans fingers there were three corruptions in the text of s john here is one but it is a foule one insteed of preaching vnto them another gospell he puts preach vnto them any other thing when there is great difference betweene another gospell and any other thing the gospell comprehendeth the principall points of faith and the whole worke of god building in vs which s paul like a wise architect corinthian had laide in the galathians others his fellow workemen might build vpon it gold siluer and pretious stones with great merit to themselues and thanks from s paul marry if any should digge vp that blessed and only foundation amp would lay a new one him s paul holdeth for accursed so that that falsification of the text is intolerable and yet when all is done nothing can be wringed out of it to proue the written word to comprehend all doctrine needfull to saluation for s paul speaketh there only of his gospell that is of his preaching vnto the galathians and not one word of any written gospell no more doth he in that place to timothy and so it is nothing to purpose the greeke is word forword if we or an angell from heauen shall preach vnto you beside that which we haue preached let him be accursed your vulgar latine all one with it in a maner praeterquam quod praeterquam quod for praeter id quod as it is in the next verse where the greeke is all one your interlin bib praeter quod interlinear praeter quod in both verses you will haue the apostle meane another gospell and so will master perkins for by another thing he vnderstands such another thing as shall be necessarie to saluation and yet diverse from that which the apostle had deliuered and what is that else but another gospell you tell vs the gospell comprehends the principall points of faith whereas before in this point you giue no more to the whole scripture but that some principall points may be gathered out of it this would haue made a contradiction in master perkins but is there any thing necessarie to saluation that is not a principall point of faith is not that a principall point without which a man cannot be saued but if as you adde the gospell comprehend also the whole worke of god building in vs either i conceiue not what you meane by those words or else he that teacheth any other course of god building in vs then the gospell prescribes preacheth another gospell which doctrine will go neere to ouerthrow the greatest part of your will worship you proceed and say that the apostle speakes of such a doctrine as digs vp the foundation what is the foundation if it be not digged vp as long as christ is held to be the messiah and that without him there is no saluation as you commonly expound the gospell of faith in christ questionles the apostle speakes not of ouerthrowing the foundation because the galathians against whom he writes did not think that any saluation could be had without christ but gal that the law morall and ceremoniall was to be ioyned with christ to iustification if the foundation may be razed though those points be not denyed and if to ioyne the law with christ be to lay another foundation and to preach another gospell how can your popish synagogue be a true member of christs church in which the foundation is shaken in coupling the law with christ and another gospell preached by teaching such points of doctrine for matter necessarie to saluation as the apostles neuer deliuered master perkins therefore vnderstanding by any thing only things that make another gospell as the question in hand and tim the other place alleaged shew a diverse doctrine may neither be charged with nor suspected of false dealing bellarm de verbo dei non script lib cap bellarmine a cardinall and a man of as great iudgement as you affirmes that the apostle in that place speakes both of the written and vnwritten word not as you would haue it only of the gospel preached and aug contr lit petil lib cap austin applies the text to the scripture of the law and of the gospell other then that which you haue receiued in the legall and euangelicall scriptures that is in the old and new testament basil moral sum cap basill also saith the like of the same matter that the hearers must examin those things that are deliuered by their teachers and receiue those that are agreeable to the scripture and reiect those praeterquam quod that are diverse which he prooues by that place to the galathians and whereas bellarmine would haue their testimonies vnderstood of things contrary only the very words refute him but it is apparant that all that paul preached is in the scriptures for out of them doth he still confirme his doctrine they of act berea found that which hee taught them to agree with the scriptures and act himselfe auoucheth before festus that he preached nothing but that which moses and the prophets had taught and so both these places are to purpose testimonie iv tim the whole scripture is giuen by inspiration of god amp is profitable to teach to improoue to correct and to instruct in righteousnesse that the man of god may be absolute beeing made perfect vnto euerie good worke in these wordes be contained two arguments to prooue the sufficiencie of the scripture without vnwritten verities the first that which is profitable to these foure vses namely to teach all necessarie trueth to confute all errours to correct faults in manners and to instruct in righteousnesse that is to informe all man in all good duties that is sufficient to saluation but scripture serueth for all these vses and therefore it is sufficient and vnwritten traditions are superfluous in these words are contained saith m perkins two arguments to proue the sufficiencie of scripture the first that which is profitable to these foure vses to teach all necessary truth is not in the text to confute errors to correct faults in manners to instruct all man in all dutie is m perkins his addition to the text that is sufficient to saluation but the scriptures serue for all these vses ampc ans this text of holy scripture is so farre from yeelding our aduersaries two arguments that it affoordeth not so much as any probable colour of halfe one good argument in searching out the true sense of holy scriptures we must obserue diligently the nature and proper signification of the words as m perkins also noteth out of s augustine in his sixt obiection of this question which if the protestant did here performe they would make no such account of this text for s paul saith only that all scripture is profitable not sufficient to teach to proue ampc how are they then carried away with their owne partiall affections that cannot discerne betweene profitable and sufficient good timber is profitable to the building of an house but it is not sufficient without stones morter and a carpenter seed serues well yes is also necessary to bring forth corne but will it suffice of itself without manuring of the ground and seasonable weather and to fit our purpose more properly good lawes are very profitable yes most expedient for the good gouernment of the common vvealth but are they sufficient vvithout good customes good gouernours and iudges to see the same law and customes rightly vnderstood and duly executed euen so the holy scriptures s paul affirmeth are very profitable as contayning very good and necessarie matter both to teach reproue and correct but he saith not they are sufficient or that they do containe all doctrine needfull for these foure ends and therefore to argue out of s paul that they are sufficient for all those purposes vvhen he saith only that they are profitable to them is plainly not to knovv or not to care vvhat a man h and to presse such an impertinent cauil so often and so vehemently as the protestant do is nothing else but to bevvray vnto the indifferent reader either their extreame ignorance or most audacious impudency that thinke they can face out any matter be it neuer so impertinent the text was set downe before without any addition now master perkins shewes how he gathers his argument out of the text without adding to it at all but interpreting it now whereas hee saith all necessarie truth how much lesse affirmes lyra ad tim lyra when he addes to veritatem teach the truth for if by that word he should meane no more but some truth it were but a bare exposition but that he vnderstands by it all truth i gather out of his other exposition that followes for which also you blame master perkins to instruct all man in all dutie the word is in all righteousnes that is to glossa interlin ibi make him righteous with legall righteousnes saith lyra which is all omnis virtus or euery vertue that the profitablenes of the scripture to those purposes argues a sufficiencie it is the iudgement of the best interpreters there is no sicknes of the soule saith de dupl martyr cap cyprian for which the scripture of god affoords not a present remedie he proues it by the place of timothy hieron ad tim ierome saith the scripture was giuen to teach vs that doing all things by the aduice thereof we might doe iust things iustly chrysost ibi chrysostom is yet more plaine if we be to learne or to be ignorant of any thing there we shall learne it if to conuince falsehood thence we shall fetch it if we be to correct or chastice for exhortation if any comfort be wanting which must be had out of the scripture we shall learne it and vpon those words that the man of god may be perfit therefore without the scripture hee cannot bee made perfect in steed of me saith paul thou hast the scriptures if thou desire to learne any thing thence thou shalt or there thou maist haue it the scripture saith theophylact ibi theophylact is profitable to vs teaching vs if any thing be to be learned for there is nothing that cannot be answered by the holy scripture if vaine and false things be to be reprooued thence also it may be done if any thing be to be corrected if any man be to be instructed that is to be taught to righteousnes that is that he he may do that which is righteous this also is ready for thee in the scripture and afterward he makes the apostle speake thus to timothy if thou wilt be perfect and holy ampc let the scriptures be thy counsellors in steed of me and vpon these words perfect to euery good worke not simply saith theophylact particeps bonorum operum partly fitted to good workes but perfect not so that he shall be fitted to this and not to that but to euery good worke that he may be perfect to euery good worke saith lombard ad tim peter lombard expounding the word instructus which is in your vulgar translation thomas ibi thomas goes further to euery good worke not onely to those workes which are for necessitie of saluation but to those also that are of supererogation and a little before if the effect of holy scripture be fourefold to teach the truth to conuince falsehood for speculation to draw from euill and bring to good for practise the last effect of it is that it brings man to perfection non enim qualitercunque bonum facit sed perficit for it doth not make a man good in part but perfectly it is proper to the holy scripture saith caietan ibi caietan to teach the igrant and that he may be perfect in all things that belong to the perfecting of a man of god and afterward see whether the profit of the holy scripture teads to the perfection of the man of god that is of him who giues himselfe wh ly to god to such a perfection i say that he may be perfect to the practis of e ery good worke i haue been som what the larger in this because this papist chargeth vs so hard not to know or not to e what wee say and yet what say we that hath not been said before by the ancient writers and many papi s themselues now for the further confirmation of this exposition though against a papist there needes no further wee may obserue out of chrysostom and theophylact that the apostle paul being as he tim saith afterwards shortly to be offered vp commends the scriptures to timothy for instructers in his steed to which he may haue recourse as often as any truth is to be taught any error to be confuted any fault to be reprooued or any good dutie to be enioyned further we vnderstand by the apostle himself that tim the scriptures are able to make him wise to saluation and thence we conclude that they containe all things necessarie to saluation and if any thing els were requisite it is strange that the apostle should not commend the especiall meditation thereof vnto him since without it he could not be perfect the second that which can make the man of god that is prophets and apostles and the ministers of the word perfect in all the duties of their callings that same worde is sufficient to make all other man perfect in all good works but god word is able to make the man of god perfect therefore it is sufficient to prescribe the true and perfect way to eternall life without the helpe of vnwritten traditions the same ansvvere i make vnto m perkins his second argument out of the same place that the holy scriptures be profitable to make the man of god absolute but not sufficient the same replie make i against this answer that both the apostle and the interpreters alleaged proue that they are so profitable that they make the man of god sufficient besides any man may obserue that you answer to neither part of master perkins syllogisme but roue at the imagined exposition of the place i say moreouer that master perkins doth falsely english these words into the whole scriptures when it signifieth all scripture that is euery booke of scripture and is there put to verifie that the old testament only serues to instruct to saluation for in the words next before s paul sheweth how that timothy from his infancie had been trained vp in the knowledge of the holy scriptures which saith he can instruct thee to saluation and annexeth as the confirmation thereof the text cited all scripture inspired of god is profitable to teach ampc now in timothies infancie no part of the new testament was written and therefore all scripture which is here put to proue that scripture which timothie in his infancie knew cannot but by vnreasonable wresting signifie more than all the bookes of the old testament the words are rightly translated that is often taken for these places manifestly prooue column in him dwels the whole fulnes of the godhead act the whole counsaile of god luke all the people ephesian the whole bodie rom the whole seede thess all the good pleasure matth all iudea and all the region thereabout that it must be so taken in this place dionys carthus ad tim dionysius the carthusian witnesseth all that is tota scriptura the whole canonicall scripture the scriptures saith glossa ordin ibi your ordinarie glosse and in that sense did the interpreters expound it if we take it as you doe euery psalme euery verse yes euery word as being from god by inspiration must haue all these properties for whereas you would restraine it to euery booke of scripture the words will not beare it if the old testament onely without the new had this sufficiencie can it be insufficient now the new is added which indeed is rather an explication than an addition to the former it is more than can be prooued that no part of the new testament was written in timothies childhood he being at this time but a young man and this being one of the last epistles if not the very last that euer the apostle wrote a little before his martyrdome so that there are three foule faults in this the protestant achilles the first in falsification of the text that it might seeme to be spoken of the whole which is spoken of euery part the second in applying that which is spoken of the olde testament vnto both the olde and new the third in making that to bee all sufficient which s paul affirmeth onley to bee profitable and this is all they can say out of the scripture to proue that the vvritten word containes all doctrine needfull to saluation your first and second faults are none at all the translation is true and the reason good though you expound the place onely of the old testament the third is sufficiently cleere that the profit the scripture brings is the perfecting of the man of god to euery good worke whereupon i make this inuincible argument against them out of this their ov ne position nothing is necessary to be beleeued but that which is written in holy scripture but in no place of scripture is it written that the written word containes all doctrine needfull to saluation as hath been proued therfore it is not necessary to saluation to beleeue the written word to containe all doctrine needfull to saluation your inuincible reason is like your great masters inuincible armada so strong in your conceit not in truth i denie the assumption of your syllogisme as it lies that place of timothie if there were no more prooues the matter sufficiently but if by written in the scripture you meane set downe in plaine words i denie also the proposition for many things are contained in the scripture that are not expresly deliuered and that your great champion bellarm de verbo dei scripto lib cap bellarmine knew well enough when he propounded your opinion so craftily by that word expresse expresly and by the same principle i might reiect all testimony of antiquitie as needlesse if the scriptures be so al sufficient as they hold yet let vs here what testimony m perkins brings out of antiquity in fauour of his cause not only you may but you must also reiect all testimonie of antiquitie that would bring in any doctrine necessarie to saluation which cannot be prooued by scripture indeed the writings of the ancients are as you call them testimonies that is witnesses of the truth deliuered in the scripture not autenticall records of any other truth to this purpose they are highly to be esteemed when they agree with the truth and to beheld as agreeing when there is not some good reason to be brought to the contrarie v the iudgement of the church turtul de resurrect carnis saith take from hereticks opinions which they maintaine with the heathen that they may defend their questions by scripture alone and they cannot stand here scripture alone is opposed as euery one may see vnto the writings of heathen authors and not to the traditions of the apostles and therefore make nothing against them the scripture is tertull de relurrect carnis cap here appealed to as the onely competent iudge in matters of controuersie about religion for otherwise if heretikes would flie to reuelations and thereby defend their errors they might be said not to do against this rule of tertullian yes if traditions were of force to prooue they might easily answere tertullian in this case that it skilled not though they could not maintaine their opinions by scripture as long as traditions perhaps might make for them but tertullian condemnes their errors because they cannot be auowed by the scripture making that the onely triall againe we need no curiositie after christ iesus nor inquisition after the gospell when we beleeue it we desire to beleeue nothing beside for this we first beleeue that there is nothing more which we may beleeue by the gospell there is vnderstood all our christian doctrine written and vnwritten and not only the written word of the foure euangelists else we should not beleeue the actes of the apostles or their epistles no more than traditions which christian doctrine written and vnwritten we only beleeue by diuine faith to all other authors we giuesuch credit as their writings do deserue by tertull de praeser aduers haeret cap the gospell the doctrine of saluation by christ is vnderstood which is no lesse plainly and fully deliuered in the other writings of the new testament than in those foure bookes which we call by that particular name but that traditions should be commended vnder the title of the gospell it is neither true nor likely you must shew some place of this author or of some other about his time to giue credit to your interpretation but it is apparant you answered at adventure not knowing where it is to be found in tertullian if any man desire to see tertullians iudgement of traditions let him read his book of prescriptions against heretikes where he auerreth that traditions serue better than the scriptures themselues to confute all heresies heretikes alwaies either not allowing all the bookes of scripture or else peruerting the sense and meaning of the scriptures he that hath to doe with such heretikes as tertull de praeser aduers haeret tertullians aduersaries then were and you papists in part now are must of necessitie haue recourse to the iudgement of the church for what other meanes can be vsed against them that denie the sufficiencie of the scripture therefore tertullian and irenaeus too who had to deale with the same kinde of man labours to beate them with their owne weapons and yet bring not in any new doctrine beside the scripture but maintaine the doctrine of the scripture against them that condemne the scripture by the testimonies of learned man custome of the church but he saith nothing of giuing like authoritie to the traditions and written word beside here is no speech of doctrine but only of obseruing certaine outward ceremonies not necessarie to saluation augustine booke cap de doct christ in those things which are plainely set downe in scripture are found all those points which containe faith and manners of liuing well all things necessary to be beleeued of euery simple christian vnder paine of damnation that is the articles of our beleefe are contained in the scriptures but not the resolution of harder matters much lesse of all difficulty vvhich the more learned must expresly beleeue if they vvill be saued vvhich distinction s augustine else vvhere doth signifie de peccatorum meritis cap vlt the question is only of such points as are necessarie to saluation which are all one to the learned and vnlearned vnlesse there be diverse meanes of saluation for them true it is that a minister ought to haue more knowledge then an ordinarie christian and that the neglect of laboring for it is damnable to him as all sinne is damnable but that which is necessarie to saluation is equallie necessarie for all man neither doth austen allow any such distinction but refutes it rather aug de doctri christ cap in that verie place for he saith that all that feare god do seeke the will of god in the canonicall scripture but the words alleaged are most plaine all those points that containe faith and manners of liuing well that is hope and charitie now what is necessarie for any man to saluation that is not comprized in one of these and is gathered out of many other places of his vvorkes as in that matter of rebaptizing them vvho became catholikes after they had bin baptized by heretikes he saith lib contr donat cap the apostles truly haue commaunded nothing hereof in their vvritings but that custome which was laid against s cyprian is to be beleeued to haue flowed from an apostolicall tradition as there be many things which the vniuersall church holdeth and therfore are to be beleeued in that place austen makes no mention of any such difference between the learned and vnlearned to saluation but teacheth directlie contrary to your doctrine in both points for the hard matters you speake of thus saith aug de peccat merit amp remiss lib cap austin when we dispute of darke matters where scripturarum certis claris documentis the certain and cleere instructions of the holy scriptures do not help vs a mans presumption must restraine it selfe and not incline to either side this is austens iudgement he leades vs not in these cases to traditions as you do now for the other point he addes presently after that if the knowledge of hard questions could not be wanted without losse of saluation there would be some cleere authoritie of scripture to instruct vs in them so far was austen from seeking to any traditions as necessarie to saluation this testimonie is falsely alleaged by you in the later part of it which is thus in aug contr donatist lib cap austin and therefore are to be beleeued to haue bin enioyned by the apostles you put the matter indefinitly are to be beleeued that so they may be thought necessarie to saluation of which there is not a word in this place of austen the same saith he of the custome of the church in baptizing infants de genes ad lit lib c and in his epistle of the vvord that is not in the holy scripture and yet neuerthelesse is defended to be vsed in the assertion of faith as also saith he vve neuer read in those bookes that the father is vnbegotten and yet we hold that he is so to be called and s augustine holds that the holy ghost is to be adored though it be not vvritten in the vvord of the custome of baptising infants austin saith that it is not to be despised nor by any meanes to be thought superfluous and that it were not at all to be beleeued vnlesse it were an apostolicall tradition where he speakes not of any doctrine necessary to saluation but of the churches practise and that indeede in a case grounded on the scripture we speake of doctrine not of words as aug de genes ad lit lib cap austin doth in those places the matter which is signified by those words that aug contra maximin lib cap christ is of the same substance with his father that the father was not begotten may be proued by the scripture and must needs be held the words are neither in the scripture nor bring any danger of saluation though they be denyed if the points of doctrine signified by them be beleeued yet were it a great presumption and follie for any man to refuse such words as haue bin fitlie applied by the former churches the other point of adoring the holy ghost hath a strong foundation on those places of scripture which prooue him to be god as many do but what is all this to the purpose for the stablishing of any doctrine necessarie to saluation by tradition the like of the perpetuall virginity of our b lady haeresi out of vvhich and many more such like vve gather most manifestly that s augustine thought many matters of faith not to be contained in the vvritten vvord but to be taken out of the churches treasurie of traditions the fourth heresie in austin is the basilidians who held no such opinion of the virgin mary indeed there were other heretikes the aug de haeres haeres non in number who denyed her virginitie after our sauiours birth falsely as we verily perswade our selues but this is no matter necessarie to saluation though it be an heresie to hold that as a matter of faith which hath no warrant from the scripture but rather the contrarie vincentius lyrinen saith the canon of the scripture is perfect and fully sufficient to it selfe for all things i thinke that there is no such sentence to be found in him hesaies by way of obiection vvhat need we make recourse vnto the authority of the ecclesiasticall vnderstanding if the canon of the scripture be perfect he affirmeth not that they be fully sufficient to determine all controuersies in religion but throughout all his booke he proues the cleane contrary that no heresie can be certainly confuted and suppressed by only scriptures without we take with it the sense and interpretation of the catholike church vincentius cap vincentius saith that the canon of the scripture is satis superque sufficit sufficient and more then sufficient for all things and in another place the canon of the scripture sufficeth it selfe for all things the vincentius lyrin cap former place is those very words which you alleage falsely where vincentius thus speakes here perhaps some man will demaund what the authoritie of the ecclesiasticall vnderstanding of the scripture needs seeing the canon of the scripture is perfect and more then sufficient to it selfe for all things his answere is that the interpretation of the church is requisite because diverse man expound the scripture diuersly but what is this against the sufficiencie of the scripture or for the authoritie of traditions concerning matters not contained in the scriptures beside these testimonies other reasons there bee that serue to prooue this point i the practise of christ and his apostles who for the confirmation of the doctrine which they taught vsed alwaies the testimonie of scripture neither can it be prooued that they euer confirmed any doctrine by tradition act i continue vnto this day witnessing both to small and great saying none other things then those which the prophets and moses did say should come and by this wee are giuen to vnderstand that wee must alwaies haue recourse to the written worde as beeing sufficient to instruct vs in matters of saluation first for our sauiour christ iesus he out of his diuine wisdome deliuered his doctrine most commonly in his owne name but i say vnto you and very seldome confirmeth it with any testimony out of the law the euangelists do ofte note how christ fulfilled the old prophecies but neuer or very seldome seeke to confirme his doctrine by test money their owne they do sometimes but to say they neuer wrote any thing out of tradition proceeds of most grosse ignorance where had s mathew the adoring of the sages s john baptists preaching briefly that was done before his owne conuersion but by tradition s marke wrote the most part of his gospel out of tradition receiued from s peter as witnesseth eusebius lib history cap s luke testifieth of himself that he wrote his whole gospel cap as he had receiued it by tradition from them who vvere eye vvitnesses what desperate carelesnesse was it then to affirme that the apostles neuer vsed tradition to confirme any doctrine when some of them built not only parcels but their whole gospels vpon traditions our sauiour doth ordinarily confirme his doctrine especially if there be any question of it out of the bookes of the old testament by that he repeld sathan by that he confuted the pharises and defended his disciples eating the eares of corne on the sabbath by that he taxeth the iewes blindnes and maintaines his owne speaking in parables by the same he ouerthrowes the iewes traditions and rebukes their hypocrisie he refutes their errors about diuorces but what should i run ouer the particulars the gospels are full of such examples master perkins hath neuer a word of the euangelist who did but write the history of our sauiours doings and sayings and yet euen they as your selfe confesse prooue that he is the messiah by the scriptures of the old testament applying them to the things he did and suffered you deuise matters to confute master perkins speaketh of confirming doctrine by traditions and you answere that they wrote something out of tradition that is they set downe somewhat in writing which themselues had heard of other and not read in the old testament and then you aske where math s mathew had the adoring of the sages euen there where moses had the creation of the world and the whole story of genesis from a better ground then tradition viz from the spirit of god the author and enditer of the scripture from whom also the other euangelists had the matter and penning of their gospell though two of them marke and luke first came to the knowledge of those things by the preaching of the apostles which had all one authoritie with the word written this is apparant of marke by euseb history lib cap eusebius himselfe who saith that the romans intreated him to set downe in writing those things which the apostle peter had taught them by word of mouth and which he also had heard him deliuer the like is to be said of s luke who was a companion of the apostle paul and wrote as the other did that which he heard of him and other of the apostles but howsoeuer the things deliuered by them came first to their knowledge it wants not much of blasphemy to make traditions the foundation of the gospels written by them for either the holy ghost did not inspire them with the matter and manner of their penning or else if it be as you would haue it the holy ghost built vpon tradition which is but an vncertaine kinde of knowledge depending vpon mens memories which may often faile them especially in carrying away speeches of discourse and disputation ii if the beleeuing of vnwritten traditions were necessary to saluation then we must beleeue the writings of the auncient fathers as well as the writings of the apostles because apostolicall traditions are not elsewhere to be found but in their bookes and wee may not beleeue their sayings as the worde of god because they often crie beeing subiect to errour and for this cause their authoritie when they speake of traditions may be suspected and we may not alwaies beleeue them vpon their word his otherreason is that if we beleeue vnwritten traditions were necessary to saluatio then we must aswel beleeue the writings of the ancient fathers as the writings of the apostles because apostolicall traditions are not elsewhere to be found but in their books but that vvere absurd for they might erre ans that doth not follovv for three causes first apostolicall traditions are aswell kept in the mind of the learned as in the auncient fathers vvritings and therefore haue more credit then the fathers vvritings it may be they were kept in the mind of the learned till they were written but that afterward and to this day they are in mens minds otherwise then as they haue learned them by reading it is not very likely beside how can traditions be kept without adding and altering if they haue no better guide then the memories of man secondly they are commonly recorded of more then one of the fathers and so haue firmer testimonie than any one of their writings what is that to master perkins reason vnlesse you will say that we are as well to beleeue the writings of the fathers where more then one writ the same thing as we are one of the apostles or euangelists alone which i perswade my selfe you will not affirme thirdly if there should be any apostolicall tradition related but of one auncient father yet it should be of more credit than any other thing of his ovvne inuention because that vvas registred by him as a thing of more estimation and gaine some of the rest of those blessed and godly personages vvould haue reproued it as they did all other falshoods if it had not binsuch indeed as it vvas tearmed which vvhen they did not they gaue a secret approbation of it for such and so that hath the interpretatiue consent at least of the learned of that age and the follovving for apostolicall tradition it so because they were taught by our lord yet pauls case is proper to himselfe and altogether extraordinarie the third particular is somewhat more to purpose because corinthian s paul hauing prooued by many reasons that woman might not come into the congregations bareheaded addes in the conclusion that it was enough to stop any contentions mans mouth that the apostles and the churches of god allowed of no such custome but first this hatescripture papist must be put in minde that whereas he calles these wranglers scripturists as if they had alleaged scripture for their defence there is no such thing in the text nor any one obiection so much as signified by the apostle secondly this custome of the church is not alleaged because as he seemes to presume by his conclusion afterward he wanted other reason to prooue the point for as chrysostom and others haue obserued he hath in the former part of the chapter proued it to be against nature and against scripture too thirdly he reasons not about any matter of doctrine but about the outward carriage of man and woman in the assemblie of god seruice lastly it doth no way follow that because the custome of the church must ouer way priuate mens fancies in things indifferent therefore the scripture containes not all things necessarie to saluation but must be supplied therein by traditions neither doth the apostles example warrant his conclusion the apostle hauing proued that he exhorts to by reason and scripture last of all alleages custome against contentious man in a thing which they tooke to be indifferent therefore wee must alleage scriptures when they be plaine for vs and when they are not plaine tradition euen in matters of saluation who sees not that this followes not vpon that first they alleadge thess where the apostle bids that church keepe the ordinances which he taught either them by word or letter hence they gather that beside the written word there be vnwritten traditions that are indeede necessarie to be kept and obeyed answer it is very likely that this epistle to the thessalonians was the first that euer paul writ to any church though in order it haue not the first place and therefore at the time when this epistle was penned it might well fall out that some thinges needefull to saluation were deliuered by word of mouth not beeing as yet written by any apostle yet the same things were afterward set downe in writing either in the second epistle or in the epistles of paul obserue first that insteed of traditions according to the greek and latin vvord they translate ordinances euer flying the vvord tradition vvhere any thing is spoken in commendation of them but if any thing sound against them then thrust they in the vvord tradition although the greeke vvord beare it not see for this their corruption and many other a learned treatise named the discovery of false translation penned by m gregorie martin a man most singulerly conuersant in the greeke and hebrevv tongues gregory martinus cauils were answered long since fulke against martins discou cap by doctor fulke and the answer neuer yet replied to that euer i heard of by any papist your old translation hath in steed of traditions corinthian precepts and in the gospell euery where traditions and yet the former place is to the commendation of traditions and all in the gospell to their dispraise vatablus vatablus also vseth his libertie in translating this word sometimes corinthian column marc thes amp instituta sometimes constitutio sometimes institutio the difference in our translation as farre as i can perceiue is this that we call mens precepts traditions the apostles doctrines ordinances secondly is it not plaine dotage to auouch that this second epistle to the thessalonians was the first that euer he wrote surely if none of his otherwere written before it yet his first to the same church must needs haue been written before it but let vs giue the man leaue to dreame sometimes it is easie to see that master perkins compares not this epistle with the other to the same church but with other that were written to other churches and generally with the bookes of the new testament among which if wee may beleeue iren lib cap euseb history lib c irenaeus it was the ancientest except the former and perhaps the gospell of s matthew for it was written when paul taught at athens some seuenteene or eighteene yeeres after our lord ascension whereas the gospell of s matthew as irenaeus saith was penned when paul and peter preached and founded the church at rome twentie yeeres or more after the ascension neither doth master perkins auow this for a truth but sets it down as very likely to the point of the answere that all was written after in some other of his epistles which before had bin deliuered by word of mouth how proueth m perkins that the man hath such confidence in his owne word that he goeth not once about to proue it good sir hold you not here that nothing is needfull to be beleeued which is not written in the word shew vs then where it is written in the word that saint paul wrote in his later epistles that which he taught by word of mouth before or else by your owne rule it is not needfull to beleeue it it is not the answerers dutie as i haue been faine to put you in minde before to prooue his deniall but the repliers to disprooue what he answers but for your satisfaction let me tell you that if these things the apostle speakes of were matters necessarie to saluation it is prooued that they were written afterward or before in some part of the scripture because the a scripture is sufficient to make a man wise to saluation but yet for a more full satisfaction of the indifferent reader i will set downe the opinions of some of the auncientest and best interpreters of this place of the apostle that we may see whether they thought that s paul committed all to writing and left nothing by tradition all this labour might haue been saued vnlesse it were to more purpose for wee say not that the apostle wrote all things he spake but that all things necessarie to saluation are expresly or by consequence contained in the scriptures it is out of doubt in my poore opinion that the apostle preached many things which were not written by him in these two epistles and those also matters of moment which he wils them to obserue but the question is whether it can be prooued by this text or any other that those matters are not any where recorded in the holy scriptures and yet are points necessarie to saluation s chrysostom in his most learned and eloquent comentaries vpon this text concludeth thus hereupon it is manifest that the apostles deliuered not all in their epistles but many things also vnvvritten and those things are aswell to be beleeued as the vvritten oecumenius and theophylactus vpon that place teach the same to the testimonie out of chrysostomes interpretation answere first that chrysostom saith not they were matters necessarie to saluation secondly that chrysost psalm otherwhere he ties vs to the scriptures if we will be beleeued in that we deliuer thirdly that many things may be and are in other parts of the scripture which are not to bee found in the epistles fourthly that it doth not follow the apostle paul spake something to the thessalonians which he wrote not to them therefore the apostles spake some things which they neuer writ for this place speakes only of s pauls doings not of other apostles yet i make no questio but they also did in like sort but it cannot be certainly concluded from this place fiftly i grant that all that the apostles deliuered was to be receiued as true and fit for the church in those times to which they were deliuered the doctrine of the gospell is perpetuall matters of circumstance appointed by them for the vse of the churches perpetually are as well to be obserued as the doctrine if there be any such yes traditions of this nature are equall to things written but here lies the matter we say there are no such traditions and indeed who can thinke that the apostles would write matters of small importance which were also not to continue perpetually and leaue great and waightie points of faith vnwritten the like answer i make to oecumen amp theophylact ad thess oecumenius and theophylact whereof the one professedly sets downe chrysostoms opinion the other according to his custome writes him out in this place word for word s basil speaketh thus i hold it apostolicall to perseuer in traditions not vvritten for the apostle ith i commend you that yee are mindfull of my precepts and do hold the traditions euen as i deliuered them vnto you and then alleageth this text hold the traditions vvhich you haue receiued of me either by vvord or epistle basil de spirit sanct c basil saith not that these traditions were matters necessarie to saluation he defines not what these traditions were the consequence is naught the apostle wils the thessalonians to keepe things deliuered by mouth therefore the church is alwaies to keepe some things not written there was a necessitie to lay that charge vpon them for else they had needed to care for no more than was set down in those epistles the papists themselues obserue not all the traditions there mentioned as apostolic by basil his iudgement in this case is not much to be accounted of who pronounceth that without those traditions the gospellis not auaileable and y t they are of equall force with the gospell to pietie s john damascen accordeth with the former saying lib de fide cap that the apostles deliuered many things vvithout vvriting s paul doth testifie vvhen he writeth therefore brother stand and hold the traditions vvhich haue been taught you either by vvord of mouth or by epistle these holy and iudicious expositors of s paul free from all partiality gather out of this text of his that many things necessary to be beleeued euen vntill their daies remained vnvvritten and were religiously obserued by tradition which throweth fiat to the ground m perkins his false supposition fenced with neither reason nor authority that s paul put in vvriting aftervvard all that he had first taught by vvord of mouth damascen is neither greatly to be respected nor saith any thing but that which i haue answered alreadie and granted in part as nothing to the purpose he might well erre in matter of tradition that damascen de orthod fide lib c accounts the apostles canons set out by clement bishop of rome to be canonicall scripture which opinion the papists themselues reiect master perkins would gladly haue acknowledged any tradition that could haue been prooued to be apostolicall namely so farre as it was intended by the apostles whatsoeuer they taught that hee would hold to bee the truth of god if they ordained any thing for those times he would confesse it to haue been most fit did they appoint any custome to bee perpetuall m perkins would haue embraced it with both his armes and if occasion had been offered haue maintained it with his life but neither can you shew any such tradition nor he is to proue the contrarie but you are to make good your proposition that the apostles left some doctrines necessarie to be beleeued to saluation by word of mouth onely without any ground in scripture for the particulars either expresly or by good and necessary consequence proue this and the controuersie is at an end moreouer s paul immediatly before his death in one of the last of his epistles commandeth his deare disciple timothie tim to commend vnto the faithfull that vvhich he heard of him by many vvitnesses and not that only vvhich he should find vvritten in some of his epistles or in the vvritten gospell i deny your consequence paul wils timothy to commend to the faithfull those things which he had heard of him therefore he deliuered some things which are not written in any part of the scripture i might adde and those necessary to saluation but the other hath worke enough for you obiect ii that scripture is scripture is a point to be beleeued but that is a tradition vnwritten and therefore one tradition there is not written that we are to beleeue answer that the bookes of the olde and new testament are scripture it is to bee gathered and beleeued not vpon bare tradition but from the very bookes themselues on this manner let a ma that is indued with the spirit of discerning reade the seuerall bookes withall let him consider the professed authour thereof which is god himselfe and the matter therein contained which is a most diuine and absolute truth full of pietie the manner and forme of speech which is full of maiestie in the simplicity of words the end whereat they wholy aime which is the honor and glory of god alone ampc and he shal be resolued that scripture is scripture euen by the scripture it selfe yes and by this meanes hee may discerne any part of scripture from the writings of man whatsoeuer thus then scripture prooues it selfe to be scripture and yet wee despise not the vniuersal consent or tradition of the church in this case which though it doe not perswade the conscience yet is it a notable inducement to mooue vs to reuerence and regard the writings of the prophets and apostles it will be said where is it written that scripture is scripture i answere not in any one particular place or booke of scripture but in euerie line and page of the whole bible to him that can read with the spirit of discerning and can discerne the voice of the true pastour as the sheepe of christ can doe the second argument for traditions is this to beleeue that there be so many bookes of holy scripture and no more and that those be they vvhich are commonly taken so to be is very necessary to saluation novv this is not to be found vvritten in any place of holy scripture but is receiued only by tradition vvherefore it is necessary to saluation to beleeue some tradition you propound not master perkins reason but frame one of your owne to which i answer that is called in this question necessarie to saluation without the beleefe where of a man cannot be saued but the knowledge of the number of the bookes of scripture and what they be is not so necessarie but that without it a man may attaine to saluation yes who doubts that he may be saued which knowes not that there are any bookes of scripture at all so that by the preaching of the word he beleeues truly in iesus christ and if those two points be absolutely necessarie what shall we thinke of them that haue doubted of some parts of scripture as the epistles to the hebrews and that of iames damascen added one to the number your papists many m perkins ansvvereth that the bookes of the old and nevv testament be scripture is not beleeued on bare tradition but by the bookes themselues on this manner let the man vvho is indued vvith the spirit of discerning reade the bookes and consider first the author of them vvho is god then the matter contained vvhich is diuine the manner of speech vvhich is full of maiestie in simple vvords lastly the end aymed at vvhich is god honor and by this meanes he shall discerne any part of scripture from the vvritings of man vvhatsoeuer reply a vvise and deepe obseruation i vvarrant you and vvell vvorthie a graue author let vs examine it briefly first he vvill haue his man endued vvith the spirit of discerning who shall endue him vvith the spirit m perkins seemeth to say that euery sheepe of christ hath his spirit but s paul de doctrin christ cap de ciuit dei lib cont ep gaudent teacheth plainly the contrary that some certaine only haue the iudgement to discerne and touching this matter of discerning vvhich books are canonical vvhich are not not the learnedst in the primitiue church vvould take vpon him to discerne vvhich they were three hundred yeares after christ was left vndefined by the best learned whether the catholike epistles of s iames and iude the second of s peter the second and third of s john and his apocalyps were canonicall or no as is confessed on all parts hath then euery christian this spirit of discerning when the best christians wanted it who more profound more skilfull to discerne than that subtile and sharpe doctor s augustine and yet the protestant will not allow him the true spirit of discerning which bookes be canonicall for he in diverse places of his workes de praedest sanct holdeth the bookes of the machabees to be canonicall scriptures and expresly proueth the booke of wisdome so to be and yet our protestant will not admit them see therefore how foolish and vaine his first rule is come to the second master perkins denies the assumption of the contract syllogisme propounded by himselfe affirming that the scripture is to be beleeued to be scripture vpon bare tradition if you will refute him you must prooue that assumption till that be done his answere must stand for sufficient howsoeuer that he addes for the confirmation of it be true or false but let vs examin that he brings first he saith a man must haue the spirit of discerning to which you knowing not what to answere tell vs that master perkins seemes to say that euery sheepe of christ hath his spirit if he did say so plainely he saith no more then our sauiour himselfe doth and his apostle paul but he doth not once glaunce at that point in any part of his answere yet you refute that but slenderly for the corinthian apostle speakes of an extraordinarie gift bestowed vpon some man not denying this generall abilitie which all true christians haue in some measure neither doth the apostle speake of discerning doctrine but spirits that is saith your glossa interlin ad corinthian glosse and lombard b thomas ca an lombard thomas and caietan that he may discerne that he heares with what spirit it is spoken with a good spirit or with a bad by this gift the children of god are enabled or rather directed by the spirit of god to acknowledge those bookes to be scripture though they can not determine of euery particular among them austins iudgement we reuerence in this and other matters though we cannot alwaies rest vpon it he calls the bookes canonicall not properly but because they were vsed in the church to be read as the canonicall were but he makes them not of equall authoritie with the other because they were not then so generally receiued in which respect he made some doubt of those which were indeede canonicall thus we expound austin that he may not be thought to contradict other fathers in this point his second is that he who goeth about to discerne whether the booke be canonicall or no must consider the author who is god if he must at the first take god to be the author of the booke what needs any further labour it must needs be canonicall that hath god for the author this mans wi s were surely from home when he discoursed thus and therefore it should be but follie to stand vpon his particularities is there no difference trow you between saying god is the professed author and god is the author let a man consider god who is professed to be the author of these bookes and seeing how the things in them agree to that which is befitting god according as he hath learned by man and bin perswaded by the holy ghost he shall come to acknowledge them indeed to be from god wherein his glory is principally aymed at and in the penning whereof his diuine maiestie cleerely shines let this one reason in generall serue to confute him all this manner put together serueth only to helpe particular man to discerne vvhich bookes are canonicall who may easily after their d l gent inquirie erre and be de i ed in this point because euery man is a lyar rom and if there be more certaine meanes to assure them of this which is the ground of all their religion then euery particular mans discretion and iudgement then out of doubt their whole religion is most vnvvisely builded vpon meane mens inuentions and discretion who also for the most part doe neither vnderstand the language in which they were first penned nor the vsuall phrases of scriptures translated that i say nothing of the figures parables prophecies and controue sies which seeme to be and many other difficulty and yet these man need not doubt hauing learned some halfe dozen lines of master perkins but that reading any booke they shall be able presently to discerne whether be canonicall or no a goodly mocketie if this reason be good since all man together are liers as well as euery man in particular and so may be deceiued though not so easily we are little the neerer at the least not sure for any help you can affoord vs there is yet a better assurance by the see article par article holy ghosts directing the elect in this triall and teaching and assuring them so farre as shall serue for their necessarie instruction and saluation man were not so taught in the primitiue church but the most skilfull and wisest in discerning canonicall bookes trusted not vnto their ovvne iudgement but leaned alvvaies vpon apostolicall traditions so did serapion an auncient holy vvriter as euse us reporteth reiect certaine bookes set out in the apostles names because they had not receiued from their predec sso s any such the like doth element of alexandria and that famous origin lib ca of the same booke who obserue the e clesiasticall canon as he had learned and receiued by tradition so doth he deliuer his opinion of the foure euangelists and other bookes of canonicall scripture and not relying on his owne wit which was excellent or learning which was singular in all manner of languages and matters that s augustine was of the same mind may be gathered out of these words of his contra faustum of what booke can there be any assurance if the letters which the church propagated by the apostles and by such excellencie declared throughout all nation doth teach and hold to be the apostles should be vncertaine whether they be the apostles or no so that he maketh the declaratio of the church descended of the apostles to be a sure pillar to rest vpon for the certaine knowledge of canonical scripture and other spirits whatsoeuer if they follow not that rule to be reiected so far is he off from encourageing euery sheepe of christs fold to take that weighty matter vpon himselfe as m perkins doth and what can be more against the most prudent prouidence of the diuine wisdome than to permit euery one to be a iudge of the bookes of canonicall scripture for if all those books and no others should pas e u rant for ca call which any christian taking vpon him the spirit of discerning would c nsure to be such then alway with all the old testament because diverse esteemed it to proceed of some euill spirits as witnesse h i neus and ep s yes not only all the old must be abrogated but all the new also because it hath many falsehoods mixed with the truth as some prefuming greatly of their spirit and skill in d ning did teach so testifieth augustine fa st some would haue had but one of the foure gospels some fiue some sixe some seauen some reiected all s pauls epistles many and those of the faithfull did not admit for canonicall some of the other apostles epistles not the reuelations if then the diuine fore sight of our sauiour had not preuented this most foule inconueniencie by instituting a more certaine meanes of iscerning and declaring which books were penned by inspiration of the holy ghost which not then by leauing it vnto euery mans discretion he might be thought to haue had but slender care of our saluation which euery true christian hart doth abhorre to thinke and therfore we must needs admit of this most holy and prouident tradition of them from hand to hand as among the protestant brentius doth in his prolegomenis and also kemnitius handling the second kind of traditions in his examination of the councell of trent albeit they reiect all other traditions besides this one neither doth master perkins or any minister teach the people now to rely on their owne wit or iudgement but to vse the meanes prescribed and by prayer and faith to call and to rest vpon the spirit of god for assurance in this case the iudgement of the church wee are so farre from discrediting that we hold it for a very speciall ground in this matter condemning them as void of shame and reason that refuse those bookes vpon their owne iudgement which haue bin from time to time euen from the apostles dayes counted canonicall but it is vtterly from the question in hand to dispute this point and beside diverse other whitak de s riptur doctor whitacker hath handled this matter very sufficiently though euery man cannot reade his disputation because it is latine but for the matter in hand concerning traditions it falls not into this question to be disputed what is scripture and what is not for it is presupposed that the scriptures are the word of god and thereupon this doubt ariseth whether the word of god conteine all things necessarie to saluation or no if that be doubted of it is idle and absurd to enquire whether there be besides that another word of god diverse from it though not contrarie which is not written but only as man haue now and then set downe some part of it in their writings so then leauing this point let vs come to those which follow obiect iii some bookes of the canon of the scripture are lost as the booke of the war of god number the booke of the iust iosu the bookes of chronicles of the kinges of israel and iuda king the bookes of certaine prophets nathan gad iddo ahiah and semiah and therfore the matter of these bookes must come to vs by tradition answer though it be graunted that some bookes of canonicall scripture bee lost yet the scripture still remaines sufficient because the matter of those bookes so farforth as it was necessarie to saluation is contained in these bookes of scripture that are now extant the two next arguments for traditions be not well propounded by m perkins the third is to be framed thus either all the bookes of holy scripture conteine all needfull doctrine to saluation or some certaine of them without the rest not some of them without the rest for then the other should be superfluous which no man holdeth therfore all the bookes of holy scripture put together do containe all necessary instruction now then the argument followeth but some of those bookes of holy scripture haue been lo t therefore some points of necessary doctrine contained in them are not extant in the written word and consequently to be learned by tradition m perkins answereth first supposing some of the bookes to be lost that all needfull doctrine which was in them is in some of the others preserued but why did he not solue the argument proposed were then those bookes superfluous doth the holy ghost set man to pen needlesse discourses which this answere supposeth because you thinke the reason makes for your aduantage as you haue framed it your selfe i will follow your steps and leaue his argument as you do that i may answere orderly i deny your assumption all things necessarie to saluation are conteined in some certaine bookes of the scripture so that although the rest were wanting we should haue sufficient to saluation for the matter to your reason i say farther that the consequence is naught if some certaine are sufficient to saluation the rest are superfluous for first it cannot be superfluous to haue any booke of god word kept for the vse of the church though the matter of it be in some other secondly if your consequence be good it is also superfluous to haue the same psalme or story recorded in two places of the scripture especially the later but to say so were to condemne the holy ghost of hauing taken superfluous paines to no purpose which were blasphemie i prooue it by these particulars for example psalm sam psalm is in the booke of psalmes and in the second booke of samuell the history of ezechiah regina amp amp esai amp amp is regina and so forward and isai the like i might bring out of the bookes of kings and chronicles thirdly though the matter be all fully and perfectly in certaine bookes yet euery point is not so plaine in one booke as in another and therefore it is not superfluous to haue all these bookes though all matter necessarie to saluation be comprised in some few of them fourthly the purpose of the holy ghost in penning the scriptures was not only to teach matters necessarie to saluation but to set forth the glorie of god in his prouidence iustice mercie wisdome and such like to afford vs examples of diverse kinds of vertues to exhort vs to faith and good works and in a word to prouide for god glorie by vs heere as well as for our glorifying by him in heauen to which there is no booke nor sentence of scripture but serues more or lesse and therefore no booke of it can be thought supersluous though the necessarie matters belonging to saluation be conteined in certaine of them very sufficiently againe i take it to bee a truth though some thinke otherwise that no part of the canon is lost for paul saith whatsoeuer things were written aforetime were written for our learning that wee through patience and comfort of the scriptures ampc rom where he takes it for granted that the whole canon of holie scripture was then extant for if he had thought that some bookes of scripture had beene lost hee would haue said whatsoeuer was written and is now extant was written for our learning and comfort for bookes that are lost serue neither for learning nor comfort againe to hold that any bookes of scripture should be lost calls into question god prouidence and the fidelitie of the church who hath the bookes of god in keeping and is therfore called the pillar and ground of truth and touching the bookes before mentioned i answere thus the booke of the war of god number might bee some short bill or narration of thinges done among the israelites which in the daies of moses went from hand to hand for sometime a booke in scripture signifieth a roule or catalogue as the first chapter of matthew which containeth the genealogie of our sauiour christ is called the booke of the generation of iesus christ againe the booke of the iust and the books of chronicles which are said to be lost were but as the chronicles of england are with vs euen politicke records of the acts and euents of things in the kingdome of iuda and israel out of which the prophets gathered things necessarie to be knowne and placed them in holy scripture as for the bookes of iddo ahiah semiah gad and nathan they are contained in the bookes of the kinges and chronicles and in the bookes of samuel which were not written by him alone but by sundrie prophets chro as also was the booke of iudges as for the bookes of salomon which are lost they did not concerne religion and matters of saluation but were concerning matters of philosophie and such like things therefore he giues a second more shamefull that none be perished which is most contrarie vnto the plaine scriptures paral vit pa as s john chrysostom proueth rom in math amp in where he hath these expresse words that many of the propheticall bookes are lost may be proued out of the historie of paral pomeneon which they translate chronicles now as for m perkins gesses that some of them are yet extant but otherwise called some were but little rolles of paper some profane and of philosophie i hold them not worth the discussing being not much pertinent and auowed on his word only without either any reason or authoritie sauing the better iudgement of chrysostom and other learned man i cannot perswade my selfe that any part of the canonicall scripture is lost when you haue brought your proofe out of any place of the scripture i will either answere or yeeld to it but it makes nothing to your argument whether any be lost or no for as you see i deny your assumption and the proofe of it which ouerthrowes your whole reason the iewes and the skilfullest christians in the rabbines and antiquities of the iewes that i know are of a diverse iudgement from chrysostom concerning this point obiect iv moses in mount sina beside the written law receiued from god a more secret doctrine which he neuer writ but deliuered by tradition or word of mouth to the prophets after him and this the iewes haue now set downe in their cabala answer this indeede is the opinion of some of the iewes whom in effect and substance sundry papists follow but we take it for no better then a iewish dotage for if moses had knowne any secret doctrine beside the written law he could neuer haue giuen this commandement of the said lawe thou shalt not adde any thing thereto master perkins his fourth obiection of the iewish cabala is a meere dreame of his owne our argument is this moses who was the pen man of the old law committed not all to vvriting but deliuered certaine points needfull to saluation by tradition nor any lavv maker that euer was in any country comprehended all in letters but established many things by customes therefore not likely that our christian lavv should be all vvritten your argument is in effect all one with his but let vs take yours moses committed all to writing that was necessarie to saluation so doe all wise lawmakers and if any thing be left vnprouided for that is of moment it is because the lawgiuer perceiued it not or knew not how to helpe it which in god lawes and moses the holie ghosts scribes writing could be no hinderances for what is there that god seeth not by his wisedome or cannot order as he list by his power that moses did not pen all thus vve proue it vvas as necessarie for vvomen to be deliuered from originall sinne as man circumcision the remedy for man could not possibly be applied to vvomen as euery one vvhoknovveth vvhat circumcision is can tell neither is there any other remedie prouided in the vvritten lavv to deliuer vvomen from that sin therefore some other remedie for them vvas deliuered by tradition circumcision was not prouided for remedie of originall sinne any more than for actuall neither did it remedie the one or the other nay it was not of moses appointing but was long before him the remedie for all sinne is the sacrifice of the messiah the meanes to applie it faith which moses taught in diverse places of those fiue bookes if woman without circumcision cannot be freed from originall sinne how were adam and eue freed and all that died before god enioyned it to abraham item if the child vvere likly to die before the eight day there was remedie for them as the most learned doe hold yet no vvhere vvritten in the lavv also many gentiles during that state of the old testament vvere saued as iob and many such like according to the opinion of all the auncient fathers yet in the lavv or any other part of the old testament it is not vvritten vvhat they had to beleeue or how they should liue vvherefore many things needfull to saluation vvere then deliuered by tradition the remedie for infants aswell before the eight day as vpon it and after it was the mercie of god vpon his couenant as for the meanes you would imagine which were you cannot tell what and deuised by you cannot tel whom remember what you answered about the chaldee word in daniel to meanes and authors in the ayre no thing need be nor can be answered to that reason of his that god in his prouidence should not permit such a losse of any part of the scripture i ansvvere that god permiteth much euill againe no great losse in that according to our opinion who hold that tradition might preserue vvhat was then lost although god in his prouidence permits much euill it followes not nor is at al likely that he would suffer his own holie word indited by his spirit to perish neither can it helpe the matter that tradition might preserue the truth vnlesse god should miraculously hold in man from mingling their inuentions with his traditions experience makes the matter cleere few things or none yet remaining that are indeede of antiquitie both for the substance and vse of them but what answere you to master perkins other reason out of s paul that was too heauie for your shoulders obiect v heb god word is of two sortes milk and strong meate by milke we must vnderstand the worde of god written wherein god speakes plainely to the capacitie of the rudest but strong meate is vnwritten traditions a doctrine not to bee deliuered vnto all but to those that grow to perfection answer we must know that one and the same word of god is milke and strong meate in regard of the manner of handling and propounding of it for being deliuered generally and plainely to the capacitie of the simplest it is milke but beeing handled particularly and largely and so fitted for man of more vnderstanding it is strong meate as for example the doctrine of the creation of mans fall and redemption by christ when it is taught ouerly and plainly it is milke but when the depth of the same is throughly opened it is strong meate and therefore it is a conceit of mans braine to imagine that some vn written word is meant by strong meate novv insteed of m perkins his fift reason for vs of milke and strong meate vvishing him a messe of pappe for his childish proposing of it i vvill set dovvne some authorities out of the vvritten word in proofe of traditions i make no question but master perkins had al the reasons he propounds for you in any matter in some of your owne writers as perhaps hereafter vpon better search at more leisure i shall finde and prooue to all the world to the testimonies i answere in generall that no argument can be drawne from any or all of them to proue that any doctrine necessarie to saluation is to be learned by tradition and is not written in the scripture let any man conclude the point out of them and we will yeeld if wee shew not a reasonable cause to the contrarie secondly i adde fu th r that if it were granted that there were some such traditi s et as au n ioa tract austin saith of the first place who can say these or those be they for the most part of the traditions that are now thrust vpon the church by you papists are in comparison but new and very trifles or meere superstitious our sauiour said being at the point of his passion that he had manie things to say vnto his apostles but they could not as then beare them our sauiour after his resurrection appeared often vnto his disciples speaking vvith them of the kingdome of god of vvhich little is vvritten in any of the euangelists i commend you brother that you remember me in all things and keepe the traditions euen as i haue deliuered them to you now for the particulars the ioh first is answered alreadie the act second makes a bad consequence christ spake often with his disciples of the kingdome of god of which little is written in the euangelists therfore there are some points necessarie to saluation not recorded in scripture his talke with them might be for exhortation and consolation especially who can say whatsoeuer it were that it is not written in the epistles by traditions ambros ad thess ambrose vnderstands in the thessal nothing but the gospell in that place corinthian to the corinthians the apostle seemes in all likelihood to speake of ceremonies or circumstances in their carriage about god seruice which neither is matter of saluation nor to be alwaies alike in all places and at al times so doth ambros ad corinthian ambrose vnderstand him o timothy keepe the depositum that is that vvhich i deliuered thee to keepe hold fast by the holy ghost the good things committed vnto thee to vvhich vvas as s chrysostom and thesphilact expound the true doctrine of christ the true sense of holy scriptures the right admini words be not set downe in scripture yet the matter is if not expresly which is not needfull yet by necessarie consequence as it may euidently appeare by the councill and fathers wherein and by whom the contrarie to those opinions is condemned and confuted the first point is implied necessarily in all those places by which our sauiour is prooued to be true god that is the same god with his father which you shall finde in athanas contr ana amp concil nicen athanasius writings and the first councill of nice the second of the holy ghosts proceedings from the son as well as from the father is prooued by thom cont gentil lib cap thomas out of the scripture and by other against the greeke church the third beside io that place of john is necessarily concluded since there can be but one god out of the texts that prooue euery one of them seuerally to be god and by ma h that of matthew the fourth is prooued out of scripture by concil ep the first councill of ephesus against nestorius so that for these points we neede no traditions obiect vi sundrie places of scripture be doubtfull and euery religion hath his seuerall exposition of them as the papists haue theirs and the protestant theirs now then seeing there can be but one truth when question is of the interpretation of scripture recourse must be had to the tradition of the church y t the true sense may be determined and the question ended ans it is not so but in doubtfull places scripture it selfe is sufficient to declare his owne meaning first by the analogie of faith which is the summe of religion gathered out of the clearest places of scripture secondly by the circumstances of the place and the nature and signification of the wordes thirdly by conference of place with place by these and like helps contained in scripture wee may iudge which is the truest meaning of any place scripture it selfe is the text and the best glosse and the scripture is falsly tearmed the matter of strife it beeing not so of it selfe but by the abuse of man and thus much for our consent concerning traditions wherein we must not be wauering but steadfast because notwithstanding our renouncing of popery yet popish inclinations and dispositions bee rife among vs our common people maruelouslie affect humane traditions yes mans nature is inclined more to bee pleased with them then with the word of god the feast of the natiuitie of our sauiour christ is onely a custome and tradition of the church and yet man are commonly more carefull to keepe it then the lord day the keeping whereof stands by the morall law positiue lawes are not sufficient to restraine vs from buying and selling on the sabbath yet within the twelue daies no man keepes market againe see the truth of this in our affection to the ministerie of the word let the preacher alleage peter and paul the people count it but common stuffe such as any man can bring but let man come and alleadge ambrose austin and the rest of the fathers oh he is the man hee is alone for them againe let any man bee in danger any way and straight hee sendeth to the wise man or wizzard god worde is not sufficient to comfort and direct him all this argues that popery denied with the mouth abides still in the heart and therefore wee must learne to reuerence the written word by ascribing vnto it all manner of perfection the sixt and last reason for traditions sundry places of holy scriptures be hard to be vnderstood others doubtfull whether they must be taken literally or figuratiuely if then it be put to euery christian to take his owne exposition euery seuerall sect will coyne interpretations in fauour of their owne opinions and so shall the word of god ordained only to teach vs the truth be abused and made an instrument to confirme all errors to auoid which inconuenience considerate man haue recourse vnto the traditions and auncient records of the primitiue church still you begge the question receiued from the apostles and deliuered to the posteritie as the true copies of god word see the true exposition and sense of it and thereby consute and reiect all priuate and new glosses which agree not with those ancient and holy commentaries so that for the vnderstanding of both difficult and doubtfull texts of scripture traditions are most necessary m perkins his answere is that there is no such need of them but in doubtfull places the scripture it selfe is the best glosse if these be obserued first the analogie of faith which is the summe of religion gathered out of the cleerest places secondly the circumstance of the place and the nature and signification of the words thirdly the conference of place with place and concludeth that the scripture is falsely tearmed the matter of strife it being not so of it selfe but by the abuse of man first this reason can conclude nothing against our opinion we must haue recourse to traditions for the expounding of doubtfull places therefore the scripture containes not all doctrine necessarie to saluation i denie the consequence this rather prooues the sufficiencie of the scripture as being sufficient in it selfe if it be rightly vnderstood secondly i say there is no such danger as you imagine for though some may abuse it to confirme error yet may their false interpretations be confuted by diligent examination of the text without resting vpon the authoritie of mans interpretation as it appeares manifestly by the courses that the ancient writers tooke for the confuting of all heresies and if without this it could not haue been done what should haue become of the truth before the writings of man were extant in any number for it were ridiculous to imagine that euery particular text was expounded by the apostles and so left by tradition to the church thirdly who shall determine when the time to count ancientnes by ended especially since euery mans writings were new when they were written and cannot grow in truth as they doe in age by continuance we acknowledge them for helpes of interpretation not for warrants reply to begin with his latter words because i must stand vpon the former is the scripture falsely tearmed matter of strife because it is not so of his owne nature why then is christ truly called the stone of offence or no to them that beleeue not saint peter saith yes no saith m perkins because that commeth not of christ but of themselues but good sir christ is truly tearmed a stone of offence and the scripture matter of strife albeit there be no cause in them of those faults but because it so falleth out by the malice of man the question is not wherefore it is so called but whether it be so called or no truly that which truly is may be so called truly but the scripture truly is matter of great contention euery obstinate heretike vnderstanding them according to his owne fantasie and therefore may truly be so tearmed although it be not the cause of contention in it self but written to take away all contention master perkins denies the scripture to be matter of strife and that it may so bee slandered to the disgrace of it as some papists haue most shamelesly spoken of it to draw people from the reading and louing of it what blasphemies almost haue not your writers vttered against the holy word of god albert pigh con d feeles pighius calls them dumbe iudges and in pigh hierar lib cap another place commends the truth and pleasantnes of his speech that compared the scriptures to a nose of waxe did not hosius contt bren lib hosius say of dauids psalmes we write poems euery body learned and vnlearned but to the capitall matter these three rules gathered out of s augustine be good directions wherby sober and sound wits may much profit in study of diuinitie if they neglect not other ordinary helpes of good instructors and learnd commentaries but to affirme that euery christian may by these meanes be inabled to iudge which is the true sense of any doubtfull or hard text is extreame rashnes and meere folly s augustine himselfe well conuersant in these rules indued with a most happie wit and yet much bettered with excellent knowledge of all the liberall sciences yet he hauing most diligently studied the holy scriptures for more then thirtie yeares with the helpe also of the best comentaries he could get and counsell of the most exquisit yet be ingeniously confesseth that there were more places of scripture that after all his studie he vnderstood not then vvhich he did vnderstand and shall euery simple man furnished only with m perkins his three rules of not twise three lines be able to dissolue any difficulty in them whatsoeuer why doe the lutherans to omit all former heretikes vnderstand them in one sort the caluinists after another the anabaptists a third way and so of other sects and in our owne country how commeth it to passe that the protestant finde one thing in the holy scriptures the puritans almost the cleane contrarie why i say is there so great bitter and endlesse contention among brothers of the same spirit about the sense and meaning of god word if euery one might by the aide of those triuiall notes readily disclose all difficulty and assuredly boult out the certaine truth of them it cannot be but most euident to man of any iudgement that the scripture it selfe can neuer end any doubtfull controuersie vvithout there be admitted some certaine iudge to declare what is the true meaning of it and it cannot but redound to the dishonor of our blessed sauiour to say that he hath left a matter of such importance at randome and hath not prouided for his servant an assured meane to attaine to the true vnderstanding of it if in matters of temporall iustice it should be permitted to euerie contentious smatterer in the law to expound amp conster the grounds of the law and statutes as it should seeme fittest in his wisdome and not be bound to stand to the sentence and declaration of the iudge what iniquity should not be law or when should there be any end of any hard matter one lawyer defending one part an other the other one counseller assuring on his certaine knowledge one partie to haue the right another as certainely auerring not that but the contrary to be law both alledging for their warrant sometexts of law what end and pacification of the parties could be deuised vnlesse the decision of the controuersie be committed vnto the definitiue sentence of some who should declare whether counsellor had argued iustly and according to the true meaning of the law none at all but bloody debate and perpetuall conflict each pursuing to get or keepe by force of armes that which his learned counsell auouched to be his owne no man saith so but that by these a man may iudge which is the truest that is the likeliest interpretation of a doubtfull place but i pray you tell me can you or any papist by the help of tradition added to the other three rules certainely determine what is the sense of euery hard place of scripture if you can s austin by that meanes was likelier to haue it then any of you as he was neerer the apostles from whom those traditions are said to haue come if you rest vpon the commentaries of the auntient what meanes had they to further them in vnderstanding the scripture that we now want is it not apparant that we haue all they had and their paines and iudgement beside you aske then how chance diverse man vnderstand them diuersly not because they want the tradition you talke of for who knowes not that the fathers differ exceedingly one from another in their expositions and do all the popish interpretations agree who it should seeme by you haue recourse to that maine help of tradition he that lookes into your commentaries and bookes of controuersies shall finde very diverse and sometimes contrarie expositions our sauiour christ hath prouided sufficientlie for his church by deliuering in scripture the grounds of religion so plainely some here some there that any reasonable man may with small labour vnderstand them from which they that haue knowledge of the tongues and arts especiallie of logick and rhetorick may come to vnderstand the harder places though perhaps not euery one yet at the least so many and such as shall serue to instruct the people of god in the knowledge of his will for the obtaining of euerlasting life to auoid then such garboyles and intestine contention there vvas neuer yet any law maker so simple but appointed some gouernour and iudge who should see the due obseruation of his lawes and determine all boubts that might arise about the letter and exposition of the law who is therefore called the quicke and liuely law and shall we christians thinke that our diuine lavv maker who in vvisdome care and prouidence surmounted all others more than the heauens doe the earth hath left his golden lawes at randome to be interpreted as it should seeme best vnto euery one pretending some hidden knovvledge from we knovv not vvhat spirit no no it cannot be once imagined vvithout too too great derogation vnto the soueraigne prudence of the son of god for the auoiding of outward garboiles by force or preaching false doctrine our sauiour hath appointed principallie the ciuill magistrate secondarily the gouernors of the churches for the keeping of his children from perishing by error he hath ordeined beside the outward helps of pastors and doctors the most certaine direction of his vicegerent the holy spirit who preserues all that are christs from falling away from the substance and foundation of truth to damnation not that euery man may take vpon him to interpret scripture vpon pretence of i know not what spirit but that he may assure himselfe of being kept from all error that may ouerthrow his saluation by the direction of god spirit vpon whom he calls by prayer and rests by faith to this purpose as i said before sure and who therefore were appointed to be heard without exception this befals not any man nowadayes and therefore none can iustly claime any such credit the auncients that so wrot in this point of s pauls going to see peter haue wholie mistaken the apostle who denies that of himselfe which they affirme of him for he saith gal first that he was not an apostle of man nor by man secondly that he went vp to ierusalem not gal to haue confirmation of his doctrine from them who were no way superior to him but that the gentiles might know he taught the same things that the other apostles did if he had done it for his owne assurance he act had not beleeued the vision and discredited our sauiours extraordinarie teaching of him and had taught for a time such things as he was not sure to be the truth of god but if this should be his case he had sinned grieuously in his former preaching and he had wholie ouerthrowne the authoritie of his ministrie which in these two chapters he labors especially to vphold auouching that gal he neither learned any doctrine nor receiued any allowance of his authoritie from iames cephas and john which were esteemed to be pillers yes gal he did openly reprooue peter if not of error in doctrine yet of misbehauiour in his conuersation as for the controuersie of abrogating moses law it was a case determined by scripture and no man might refuse to obey any one of the apostles charge cocerning that point but that the brother might haue the better satisfaction it pleased the holy ghost that the apostles should in a councell decide the question by act ioynt consent of themselues and the brother there assembled which any one of them might of himselfe haue ended but because diverse parts of the church were conuerted by diverse apostles and each church made most account of their owne apostle the readiest and safest way was to conclude of the matter by common consultation so afterward in all lawful councels the written word was held sufficient for the consutation of the heresies that arose from time to time but for the better stopping of the heretikes mouths and satisfying of all man sometimes the consent of former diuines churches and councels was added in good discretion for mens sake not for the matter which might be and was abundantlie prooued or discouered as occasion serued by the scriptures see cardinall bellarmine i vvill only record tvvo noble examples of this recourse vnto antiquity for the true sense of god vvord the first out of the ecclesiastical history whereof saint gregorie nazianzen and saint basil tvvo principall lights of the greeke church this is recorded they were both noble man brought vp together at athens and aftervvard for thirteene yeares space laying aside all profane bookes imployed their studie vvholie in the holy scriptures the sense and true meaning vvhereof they sought not out of their owne iudgement and presumption as the protestant both do and teach others to do but out of their predecessors writings and authoritie namely of such as vvere knovvne to haue receiued the rule of vnderstanding from the tradition of the apostles these be the very words the examples you bring are nothing against vs in this question nazianzen and basil sought the true sense of the scripture not out of their owne iudgement but out of their predecessors writings and authoritie what then therefore the scripture containes not all doctrine necessarie to saluation this consequence hath often been disprooued neither is the antecedent true if it be generally taken for their owne writings shew euery where that they vsed the help of learning and discourse to finde out the sense of scripture in many places and set downe that in their commentaries which by study they came to vnderstand if any thing were doubtfull we presume they did see article par article e amp article per t as we are sure the protestant now doe where they had not apparant reason to the contrarie rest vpon the authoritie of their predecessors rather than vpon their owne this reuerence wee giue to the fathers writings and reade them with as great dilig as they that make more bragges of th ir knowledge in he and if that rule which the storie and or you name not but it is austin speakes of one of them which we follw in searching out th of the scripture treate ou to make to vs and you shall finde that we will take it and vse it diligently if we cannot shew you certaine reasons to the contrarie if the rule be to take for truth whatsoeuer the ancients haue deliuered how many things yes contrarie expositions shal we hold for true if you say the rule is to beleeue the ancientest what shall we doe where they say nothing where their expositions are contraried by those you name and other about their time but this can be no rule of vnderstanding any more of the scripture than that which they haue expounded which is very little and origin one of the ancientest and greatest expositors is generally condemned for an heretike by epiphanius ierome austin and the best writers in diuinitie yes bellarm de purgat lib cap c prato spirituali citat synod bellarmine sheweth that origin was seene in hell with arius and nestorius and affirmeth that synod quinta cap the fift synod cursed him amongst other heretikes this rule if it be a rule will serue in very few places of the scripture the other example shall be the principal pillar of the laten church s augustine who not only exhorteth and aduiseth vs to follow the decree of the auncient church if we will not be deceiued with the obscurity of doubtfull questions but plainly affirmeth that he vvould not beleeue the gospell if the authoritie of the church did not moue him vnto it which words are not to be vnderstood as calvin would haue them that s augustine had not bin at first a christian if by the authority of the church he had not bin thereunto perswaded but that when he was a learned and iudicious doctor and did write against heretikes euen then he would not beleeue these bookes of the gospel to haue bin penned by diuine inspiration and no others and this to be the true sense of them vnlesse the catholike church famous then for antiquity generality and consent did tell him which and what they were so farre was he oft from trusting to his owne skill and iudgment in this matter which notwithstanding was most excellent this matter is so large that it requireth a whole question but being penned vp within the compasse of one obiection i wil not dwel any longer in it but here fold vp this whole question of traditions in the authorities of the auncient fathers out of whom because i haue in answering m perkins and else where as occasion serued cited already many sentences i will here be briefe aug contra crescon lib cap austin wils vs to consult with that church which the holy scripture shewes vs to be the church without any ambiguitie the ancient church hee names not but by the church so commended hee vnderstandeth the vniuersall church as he calles it that is he appeales in the question about baptisme among the donatists to the generall practise of the church in the seuerall congregations which no doubt is of great force to perswade any reasonable man in any matter that cannot be decided by the scripture for in matters of indifferencie the churches iudgement is a kinde of law so that he which in such things would not be deceiued cannot doe better than to follow it there is no word in aug contra epistle funda cap that place of austin to allow your interpretation of that sentence but rather the whole course of the speech makes for caluin i will propound the matter let any indifferent man iudge manes or manicheus in his epistle of the foundation as he termed it called himselfe the apostle of christ austin answeres that he did not beleeue him to be so and then demaunds of the manichean what course hee would take to prooue it to him perhaps saith austin you will reade the gospell to me and assay to prooue manicheus person to me out of it but what if you should light vpon one that doth not yet beleeue the gospell i truly non crederem had not beleeued the gospell if the authoritie of the church commo ret had not moued me why should i not obey them saith austin when they will me not to beleeue manicheus whom i obeyed when they willed me to beleeue the gospell these are austins words to which i will adde those that follow cap afterward that first wee beleeue that which as yet we cannot intueri discerne that being made stronger in faith we may attaine to the vnderstanding of that we doe beleeue not man now but god himselfe confirming and enlightening our minde within s ignatius the apostles scholler doth exhort all christians to sticke fast vnto the traditions of the apostles some of which he committed to writing i shewed before what little credit many of the writings wee haue of ignatius deserue eusebius authoritie is more worth but hee is euseb history lib for lib cap neither quoted nor alleaged truly the former i take to be the printers fault the latter must needes be yours ignatius saith eusebius as he past through asia vnder guard in euery citie where he came by preaching and exhortation strengthened the parishes that they should especially take heed of heresies then first newly sprung vp and should cleaue fast to the traditioni tradition of the apostles which also for more suretie he thought it necessarie for him to write now the heresies which at that time troubled the church were those of the simonians menadcians ebionites nicolaitans cerinthians saturninians basilidians for the refuting whereof the scripture is alsufficient to a reasonable man polycarpus by the authority of the apostles words which he had receiued from their owne mouthes confirmed the truth and ouerthrew the heretikes polycarpus might well refute them by authoritie of the apostles words which himselfe had heard if without the scripture they would beleeue him that hee heard them of the apostles but euseb history lib cap eusebius reports of him in irenaus words that he recited all things in that refutation agreeable to the holy scriptures it was much for the perswading of the people to whom as irenaeus saith he spake those things that he could truly say he had heard those things of the apostles by word of mouth which they might finde written in the scriptures s ireneus who imprinted in his hart apostolicall traditions receiued from policarp saith if there should be a controuersie about any meane question ought vve not to runne vnto the most auncient churches in the vvhich the apostles had conuersed and from them take that which is cleere and perspicuous to define the present question for vvhat if the apostles had not vvritten any thing at all must vve not haue follovved the order of traditions vvhich they deliuered to them to vvhom they deliuered the churches iren epistle ad floren amp lib cap irenaeus in his epistle to florinus aboue mentioned saith that he imprinted in his heart the whole carriage and discourse of polycarpus refuting the heretikes but of apostolicall traditions hee speakes neuer a word more than that polycarpus had heard those things of the apostles which he then deliuered agreeable to the scriptures in any such meane question as is not resolued of in scripture it was fit to haue recourse to those churches in which the apostles had liued yes if they had written nothing we must haue repaired to the books of the old testament the knowne word of god for all matters of substance in things indifferent the iudgment of such churches is of great authoritie origin teacheth that the church receiued from the apostles by tradition to baptize infants origin calles the tradition of the apostles their practise of baptizing infants which hath sufficient ground of scripture though not in expresse words as your church also holds and as origin in leuit homily amp in c homil origin himselfe acknowledgeth by shewing the reason that moued the apostles to baptise them as hee conceiues though indeede there is also other better warrant for it athanasius saith vve haue proued this sentence to haue been deliuered from hand to hand by fathers to fathers but yee o new iewes and sonnes of caiphas vvhat auncestors can yee shevv of your opinion where reason failed the arians on their side and could not moue them in behalfe of the church athanasius addes this as a further proofe for their confutation that the doctrine of christ being one with his father had been held from time to time in the church whereas they had no consent of antiquitie for their opinion yet had he himselfe prooued the point by many certaine reasons out of the scripture and brought this argument from the authoritie of man for confutation of their false assertion that the former diuines were not of that iudgement this athanasius refuteth by the testimonies of theognostus dionysius bishop of alexandria whom he calles eloquent and one other dionysius bishop of rome and origin whom he termes d b p de spu sanct of nazianzen in the treatise of images painfull s basil hath these words vve haue the doctrine that is kept and preached in the church partly vvritten and part vve haue receiued by tradition of the apostles in mysterie both vvhich be of the same force to godlines and no man opposeth against these vvho hath at the least but meane experience of the lavves of the church see gregory nazianzen orat in iulian if you will giue me leaue i will defend basils speech by that which may be gathered out of him viz that hee holds them things to be by tradition which are not exprest in the scriptures my ground for this exposition are these words of his out of what scripture haue we saith basil de spirit sanct c basil the very s augustine some thousand two hundred yeares agoe recordeth the very forme of arguing which the protestant vse now a daies in the person of maximinus an arrian in his first booke against him in the beginning jf thou shalt saith this heretike bring any thing out of the scriptures vvhich is common to all vve must needs heare thee but these vvords vvhich are vvithout the scriptures are in no sort to be receiued of vs when as the lord himselfe hath admonished vs and said in vaine do they vvorship me teaching commaundements and precepts of man how s augustine opposed against them vnwritten traditions hath been afore declared the like doth s bernard asfirme of certaine heretikes of his time called apostolici so that most truly it may be concluded that euen as we catholikes haue learned of the apostles and auncient fathers our noble progenitors to stand fast and hold the traditions which we haue receiued by word of mouth aswell as that which is written euen so the protestant haue receiued as it were from hand to hand of their ignoble predecessors old condemned heretikes to reiect all traditions and to she vnto the only scriptures the heretike maximinus asked nothing but reason of austin if he stood vpon the matter and not vpon the termes neither doth austin find fault with this condition nor could he in reason because as i answered before himselfe appeales to that kind of triall in that very disputation neither must i saith aug contra maxim lib cap austin to maximinus alleage the councell of nice in preiudice of the matter nor you the councell of ariminum neither am i tyed with the authoritie of this councell nor you with the authoritie of that let matter striue with matter with cause reason with reason by the authoritie of the scriptures which are not proper to you or me but common to vs both but will you heare him speake more like maximinus reade me this saith aug de pastor cap austin out of a prophet reade it out of a psalme recite it out of the lawe recite it out of the gospell recite it out of an apostle thence recite i the church disperst ouer the whole world and our lord saying my sheepe heare my voyce and a little after away with mens papers let sonent voces diuinae the voyce of god sound and august in psalm in another place away with our papers let god bookes come forth heare christ heare the truth speaking if these speeches be hereticall we confesse our selues to be heretikes but so that we haue austin on our side for an arch heretike bernard ser not in cantica bernard speakes of the hereticks called apostolicks not in his but in his sermon vpon the canticles where he saith neuer a word of their reiecting traditions no more hath aug haeres austin nor epiphan lib tomorrow haeres epiphanius where they write of them and if they did reiect traditions it was because they would establish their owne hereticall bookes viz the acts of thomas and andrew and the gospell of the egyptians which to say the truth are to be counted traditions because they haue no warrant of the scripture nor are any part of the canon it were easie for me to turne your owne sentence against you and as all man may see with good reason but it shall suffice me that i haue refuted your slaunders and shewes with sound proofe of arguments and authoritie i consider loosers must haue leaue to speake touching vowes this must bee knowne that wee do not condemne them altogether but onely labour to restore the purity of doctrine touching this point which by the church of rome from time to time hath beene corrupted and defaced we hold therefore that a vow is a promise made to god touching some duties to be performed vnto him and it is twofold generall or speciall the generall vow is that which concernes all beleeuers and it is made in the couenant both of the law and of the gospell i will here onely speake of the vow which is made in the couenant of the gospell in which there be two actions one of god the other of man god in mercy on his part promiseth to man the remission of sinnes and life euerlasting and man againe for his part promiseth to beleeue in christ and to obey god in all his commaundements all man euer made this vow vnto god as the iewes in circumcision which also they renewed so often as they receiued the passeouer and in the newe testament all that are baptized doe the like and in baptisme this vow is called the stipulation of a good conscience whereby wee purpose to renounce our selues to beleeue in christ and to bring forth the fruites of true repentance and it ought to be renued so oft as wee are partakers of the supper of the lord this vowe is necessarie and must bee kept as a part of the true worship of god because it is a promise wherein wee vowe to performe all duties commaunded of god either in the law or in the gospell it may be demaunded considering wee are bound to obedience how wee binde our selues in baptisme thereto answer though we be alreadie bound partly by nature and partly by the written word yet may wee renew the same bond in a vowe and he that is bound may further binde himselfe so it be for this end to helpe his dulnes for want of zeale and to make himselfe more forward in duties of loue to man and the worship of god to this end dauid sware to keepe the law of god psalm though he were bound vnto it by nature and by the written law it selfe the speciall vowe is that which doth not reach to the person of al beleeuers but onely concernes some speciall man vpon some speciall occasions and this kind of vow is twofold the first is the vow of a ceremonial duty in the way of seruice to god and it was in practise in the church of the iewes vnder the old testament examples hereof are two especially the first was the vowe of the nazarites whereto no kind of man were bound by god commaundement but they bound theselues god only prescribing the maner and order of keeping the same with rites pertaining thereto as abstinence from wine the not cutting of their haire and such like the second example is of the iewes when of their owne accords they vowed to giue god house or land sheepe or oxen or any like things for the maintenance of the legall worship and of this also god prescribeth certaine rules leuit now these vowes were part of the iewish pedagogie or ceremoniall law wherein god trained vp the iewes in the old testament and beeing obserued of them they were parts of god worship but now vnder the gospell they are not beeing all abolished with the ceremoniall law to which christ put an ende at his death vpon the crosse it is true paul made a vowe and since kept the same in in the time of the new testament act yet not as a part of god worship but as a thing indifferent for the time wherein he only condescended to the weakenes of the iewes that by this meanes he might bring them the better vnto christ and whereas christ is called a nazarite matth we may not thinke he was of that very order because he did not abstaine from wine but he was so tearmed because hee was the veritie and accomplishment of this order for by it was signified that god church was a peculiar people seuered or chosen out of the world and that christ in respect of holines was also separated from all sinners and the words in saint matthew he shall be called a nazarite are borrowed from the booke of iudges cap where they are properly spoken of sampson and in type or figure of christ for as sampson saued israel by his death so did christ saue his church and as sampson killed his enemy more by death then by life so did christ it is plaine therefore that this kind of vowe bindeth not vs for there are no more ceremonies to bee kept vnder the gospell for partes of god worship but the outwarde rites of baptisme and the lord supper vovves concerning meates and drinkes attire touching tasting times place daies were proper to the iewes the second kinde of speciall vowe is that whereby a man promiseth freely to performe some outward and bodily exercise for some good ende and this vow also if it be made accordingly is lawful and belongs both to the church of the olde and new testament in the olde wee haue the example of the rekabites ier who by the appointment of ionadab their father abstained from strong drinke and wine from plant vineyardes and orchardes whereby ionadab intended onely to breake them before hand and to acquaint them with their future condition and state that they should be strangers in a foreign land that so they might prepare themselues to indure hardnes in the time to come and now in the new testament wee haue warrant in like manner to vowe as if a man by drink of wine or strong drinke finde himselfe prone to drunkennes he may vowe with himselfe to drinke no more wine nor strong drinke for so long time as hee feeles the drink thereof will stirre vp his infirmitie and minister occasion of sinning of this kind also are the vowes in which we purpose and promise to god to keepe set times of fasting to taske our selues in prayer and reading of holy scriptures and to giue set almes for special causes knowne to our selues and to doe sundrie like duties and that wee be not deceiued in making such vowes certaine rules must be remembred i that the vowe be agreeable to god will and word for if it be otherwise the making as also the keeping thereof is sinne vowes must not bee the bondes of iniquitie ii it must so be made that it may stand with christian libertie for wee may not make such things necessary in conscience which god hath made free now christian liberty allowes vnto vs the free vse of all thinges indifferent so it be out of the case of offence hence it followes that vowes must be made and keept or not keept so farreforth as in conscience they may stand or not stande with our libertie purchased by christ iii the vowe must be made with consent of superiors if we be vnder gouernment thus among the iewes the vowe of a daughter might not stand vnlesse the consent of parents came thereunto iv it must bee in the power and abilitie of the maker thereof to do or not to doe a vowe made of a thing impossible is no vowe v it must be agreeable to the calling of him that maketh it that is both to his generall calling as he is a christian and to that particular calling wherein he liueth if it bee against either one or both it is unlawful vi it must be made with deliberation no better things performed then god by his lawe hath bound vs to else man could deuise better obedience or more acceptable seruice to god then he himselfe hath appointed if by better good you meane be a greater measure of obedience then is commonly performed i doubt whether any man can do more then the law of god hath required of him which is the rule of perfect obedience if you vnderstand the meanes of stirring vp our selues to the doing of our dutie to god master perkins acknowledgeth that and compriseth it in the later part though he do not expresse it secondly you say that it must proceede from our owne free choise and libertie the promise doubtlesse must haue our owne will for the ground of it and so much the word imports but the good must be a dutie commanded or at the least allowed by warrant out of the word of god in the scriptures or out of the light of true reason and the law of nature or out of reuelation before the scriptures the second point of our supposed consent is that vowes vvere some part of god vvorship in moses law but are not so in the gospell which vve also deny m perkins proues his assertion thus vovves belonged to the ceremonies of moses lavv but all those ceremonies are abolished by christs passion ans that vovves in themselues vvere no part of the ceremonies of moses lavv but true parts of the vvorship of god in all estates as vvell in the state of nature and the gospell as in moses lavv but this point m perkins handleth againe in the first point of our difference vvhere it shell be discussed thirdly he saith that speciall vovves may be made in the nevv lavv to performe some bodily exercise for some good end as to fast to taske our selues to prayer or study of holy scripture and such like but many rules must then be obserued that vve vovv an honest thing agreeable to god vvord this vve allow master perkins doth not say as you conceiue that all vowes belonged to the ceremonie of moses law but that the vow of a ceremoniall duty in the way of seruice to god apperteined thereto whereof he brings two examples of the nazarites and of the people generally at their choyse secondly that it be so made that it may stand vvith christian liberty that is that it make not such things necessary in conscience vvhich christian religion leaues at libertie this rule of his is flat repugnant to the nature of a vovv and contrary to himselfe for he saith a little before that a christian may vovv fasting prayer almsdeeds i then demaund hauing vovved these things is he not bound to performe them yes or else he breakes his vovv vvith vvhich god is highly displeased an vnfaithful promise displeaseth god then is it manifest that all vows do abridge vs of our libertie and make that unlawful for vs vvhich before our vovv vvas lavvfull vvhich is so euiden of it selfe that i maruaile vvhere the mans vvit and memorie vvas vvhen he vvrote the contrarie he speaketh agreeably to the truth without any contrarietie to himselfe for the vow alters not the nature of the thing in it selfe but only layeth a dutie vpon the vower which also is so to be performed as that by the performance of it he be not alwayes depriued of his christian libertie but that vpon occasion he may do against his vow without any iust scruple of conscience for so doing though he haue vowed otherwise in generall his other rules that a vovv be made with good deliberation and with consent of our superiours and not only of things possible but also of the better sort vve allovv for they are taken out of our doctors see s thom your cotation is somewhat with the shortest naming nothing but the tho a q article question so is also the determination of your dd vpon it for although they graunt in generall that we must haue the consent of our superiors to vowing article yet they exempt vs in this case from subiection as soone as we are out of our noneage and that they draw vs out of very quickly that a maide of or yeeres old may vow herselfe a nunne and so a youth at or or perhaps sooner may vow himselfe a frier without any consent of their parents yes directly contrary to their expresse will and commandement the points of difference betweene vs touching vowes are specially three i the church of rome teacheth that in the new testament wee are as much bound to make vowes as was the church of the iewes and that euen in externall exercises we say no considering the ceremoniall law is now abolished and wee haue onely two ceremonies by commaundement to bee obserued baptisme and the supper of the lord againe wee are not so much bound to make or keepe vowes as the iewes were because they had a commaundement so to doe and we haue none at all first the church of rome saith m perkins teacheth that in the new testament we are as much bound to make vowes as was the church of the iewes we say no considering that the ceremoniall law is now abolished and we haue only two ceremonies by commaundement to be obserued for parts of god worship baptisme and the supper of the lord ans what is not your holy day seruice which you call diuine seruice any part of god worship in your owne opinions can a publike assemblie instituted to honour god by prayer and thankesgiuing vvith externall ceremony of time place apparrell kneeling standing and sitting be no part of god worship in your irreligious congregations assembled together against christ and his catholike church be it so but admitting as you do your seruice to be good it could not truly be denied to belong vnto the worship of god whereunto belongs this idle question is it a ceremonie thinke you to assemble our selues for the seruice of god all outward seruice of god is not ceremoniall though the vse of it be in part to expresse our inward affection but to the matter of difference you grow very carelesse in your reports of our doctrine for we hold that neither in the old nor new law any man is bound to vow but that it is and euer vvas a counsell and no commandement neuerthelesse a thing of great deuotion amp perfection in both states o strange eloquence not to be vnderstood intrinsecallie belonging and much furthering the true worship of almightie god vvhich vve proue in this sort in a vovv are two things the one is the good vvhich is vovved called the materiall part as for example fasting ampc the other the promise it selfe made to god which is the forme the materiall parts do belong vnto their seuerall vertues but this promise and performance of it be substantiall parts of god vvorship for by promising of any good thing vnto god vve acknovvledge and professe that god is the soueraigne goodnesse it selfe and taketh great pleasure in all good purposes and determinations therefore to honor and vvorship him vve make that good promise againe in performing that good seruice of god vve testifie that he is most maiesticall reuerend and dreadfull and consequently that all promises made to him are to be accomplished most diligently and without delay wherein vve honor and vvorship him as contrarivvise they do much dishonor him vvho breake vvith him as if he were of no better account then to be so deluded this thing in it selfe is so certaine and cleere that he vvho denies it must needs either be ignorant in the nature of a vovv or not knovv wherin the true orship of god consisteth for according vnto the holy scripture itself all good deeds done to the glorie of god be acts of the true vvorship of god and s anne did worship god by fasting and prayer and almes bestovved on god prisoners is called a sacrifice pleasing and acceptable vnto god and it is said to be a pure religion before god to visite orphanes and vviddovves if then all other vertuous duties done to the glory of god be parts of his true worship much more vovves vvhich by speciall promise dedicate a good deed to god honour they then being of their ovvne nature speciall parts of his true vvorshippe of god it follovveth necessarily that at all times they vvere and may be vsed to the true vvorship of god if we be bound to vow in neither as indeed we are not yet are we as much bound in the one as in the other which is all master perkins saith but indeed as i conceiue hee meanes bound to it as a seruice of god wee graunt that you say of a vow and withall confesse that it is a meanes of god seruice but not properly a part otherwise then all obedience whereby we glorifie god and all helps by which we fit our selues to obedience are parts of his worship but those actions onely are held to be properly the parts of his worship which are performed immediatly for seruice to him not vsed for the better performance of it that they were in practise before moses law is euident by that vovv which iacob made of setting vp a stone which should be called the house of god and the paying the tenthes of all his goods out of which vow we also gather that god holdeth for agreeable any kind of good seruice offered vnto him out of our owne deuotion albeit he hath not commaunded it for no such thing as iacob there vowed was commaunded him but he being well assured that it would be wel taken by god which was offered of good will to his greater honor he vowed it and is in holy scripture commended for it againe that when s paul seemeth to disallow voluntary worship he must be vnderstood to speake either of erroneous or of friuolous and foolish things promised to god which do not properly serue to the setting forth of his honor gen iacobs action was directed immediatly to god seruice not intended or vsed as a helpe to further him in the worship of god that which you gather out of his example is not warrantable by it vnlesse you restraine those words good seruice otherwise than you papists commonly doe for it doth not follow that because god accepted of t vow therefore he will like whatsoeuer a man shall promise him so it be as he imagines to the greater honor of god the former of these two was in likelihood inioyned adam by god and so continued among the true worshippers of god the latter is grounded vpon that principle that we must glorifie god in our soules body and goods though the manner be left free to euery mans discretion according to his abilitie and opportunitie but no man may conclude hereupon that god in his solemne worship allowes of whatsoeuer wee out of our deuotion inuent and appoint to serue him by that column of paul must needes be vnderstood of such things but such are all that are deuised by man to worship god by without warrant from the word of god either generally or particularly expresly or by necessarie consequence for all such seruing of god is worship depending wholy vpon the will of man and so will worship the ceremonies of your roman church are generally foolish and ridiculous yes those in your masse your doctrines besides scripture erronious as i shewed in the last article but they alleadge to the contrarie the prophet esay cap who speaking of the time of the gospell saith the egyptians shall know the lord and shall vowe vnto him and keepe it i answere two waies first that the prophet in this place expresseth and signifieth the spirituall worship of the new testament by ceremoniall worship then vsed as hee doth also in the last chapter where he calleth the ministers of the new testament priests and leuites secondly we graunt the church of the new testament makes vowes vnto god but they are of morall and euangelicall duties which must not be left vndone and if vowing will indeede further them it is not to bee neglected and therefore so oft as wee come to the lord table wee in heart renew the vowe and promise of obedience and though vowes be made of thinges and actions indifferent yet are they not any parts of god worship which is the point to bee prooued now that vowes should be frequented in the s e of the pell besides the euidence of s p vo and diverse other e prophet esay did foretell in th se word sacrifice and gifts and they sh ll vo vo s our to which m perkins answereth first that by such cere as th n was in vse the prophet doth expresse the spirituall the new testament this exposition is voluntary and nothing for what is more vild and absurd than o declare that christians shal make no vowes to say that they shall make vovves as though one contrarie vvere fit or vvould serue to expresse the other this exposition being very vnmeete m perkins adioyneth a second that in the nevv testament vve haue vovves of morall and euangelicall duties but such are not any part of god vvorship o that first you shall haue no vovves at all secondly the vvind being changed you shall haue them but as no parts of god vvorship as though morall and euangelicall duties vndertaken and performed to god greater glory bee not the very synevves and substance of his seruice and vvorship that act s pauls vow maketh nothing for you master perkins hath shewed it is marueile you would name the example and not refute his answere belike the truth of it was too euident and yet it had been no hard matter perhaps to finde as good a shift for that place as you haue for the other esay of esay master perkins answered to it that the prophet signifieth the spirituall worship of the new testament by the ceremonies of the old then in vse and he prooues his interpretation by the prophet himselfe who esay afterwards calles the ministers of the new testament priests and leuites which were offices and names proper to the old you slip ouer the reason and ell vs that it is vile and absurd to say that christians shall make vowes to declare that they shall make none but the prophet meanes to de from senacherib the generall doctrine ensuing from it is this that we are to be thankefull to god when he hath deliuerd vs out of any extraordinary danger your second reason is of lesse force for first by the kings of the earth the lyra ibid kings bordering vpon ierusalem and those parts are signified who should be driuen into a feare of god that had so destroyed the assyrians secondly if it be generall it followes not that therefore the vowes he speaketh of there may be made of any sort of man but that all man must performe the dutie of thankefulnes vpon like occasions thirdly because the auncient fathers take it to extend vnto vs christians aswellas vnto the iowes let one s augustine serue in his commentarie vpon this psalme because vve haue handled those things saith he pe ture thou vvho vvast vvilling before but novv vvilt not vovv but m ke vvhat the psalme said vnto thee it saith not doe not vovv but vovv and pay it vvilt thou not vovv therefore vvouldest thou haue vovved but not haue fulfilled it ay rather do both let the one be of ovvne promise the other shall be performed by the helpe of god he then tooke these words to belong vnto his auditors vvho were no levves in the same place he doth highly commend christians for vovving some chastitie some hospitality some pouerty ibid theodoret auncienter then austin and not inferiour to him in expounding the scripture applyes it to bringing of gifts as also the psalm psalme it selfe in the later part of the verse and the practise of the people at that very time warrant him so also may au ust ad psalm austin himselfe for all those words be vnderstood for what do they import but an exhortation to thankefulnes vnder the legall termes of vowing if austin or any man else will ground other doctrine vpon it he deliuers his owne conceipt not the prophets meaning i thinke there is no man that readeth those commentaries of austins vpon the psalmes but finds that he mistakes the sense very commonly which is to be imputed to his want of knowledge in the tongues especially in the hebrew but because contraries being set together each doe more liuely appeare in his kind let vs vvith this exposition compare m perkins his commentary vpon this place vvho saith that the prophet speaketh of vovves of prayer and thankesgiuing for so saith m perkins doth he expound himselfe my vovves are vpon me j vvill offer prayses vnto god well aymed i vvarrant you the psalme fiftie sixt vvritten first is the exposition of the psalme seuenty fiue which was conceited and vttered after again in the psalme seuenty fiue dauid speaketh to others in the other he speaketh of himself thirdly the prophets vvords in psalme fiftie sixe confirme rather that vvhich he taught before that all considerate vovves are prayses and parts of god vvorship or as the vvords do more literallie ound because his vovves that is his prayers and desires vvere by god accomplished therefore he would praise and thanke him that by vowes in this place prayer is meant not only the hebr i in e p septuaginta and ambr orate ambrose witnes but esai hezekiahs practise confirmes to deny that thankefulnes is vrged is not to vnderstand the occasion of the psalme and the end of the exhortation which requireth vowes be they what they may be but only in that respect master perkins therefore needed not any further proofe then the text it selfe but for the better auowing of his exposition he brought psalm another place of the psalmes where vowes do signifie praise or thanksgiuing now whereas he saith that dauid expounds himselfe and you refute that by the placing of the psalmes your answere is not sufficient for any man may see the psalmes were not set in order as they were penned in time and if that psalme were a prophesie of senacheribs ouerthrow as i shewed theodoret ad psalm theodoret thinks it might well be written before psalme but master perkins had no such meaning onely he expounds the word vowes vsed in this place by the certaine sense of it in another which course is agreeable to the rules of interpreting the scripture but in the one you say dauid speaketh of himselfe in the other he speaketh to other what then is it not more then likely that he exhorts others to the duety he practised himselfe if in his owne person he meane by vowes praise what else should be vnderstood by exhorting other man to vow especially vpon the like occasion that is as you say afterward vpon hauing their prayers amp desires accomplished your collection that dauid should proue that all considerate vowes are praises and part of god worship hath no likelyhood of truth in it for the prophet declares by that speech that he had vowed to praise god as the next verse before sheweth in part and the practise of dauid and the rest of the godly euery where in scripture confirmeth and this is a sacrifice of speciall honor to god as by the psalm psalme appeares by which lyra ad esai lyra expounds that of esai whereof before see hieronym amp theodor ad psalm amp amp ierome on psalme and and and theodoret on the same places ii point of difference they also hold that vowes made euen of things not commaunded as meates drinkes attire ampc are partes of god worship yes that they tend to a state of perfection in that the keeping of them brings man to an higher estate then the keeping of the law can doe we flatly say no holding that lawful vowes bee certaine adminicula cultus diuini staies and props of god worship and not the worship itselfe for paul saith plainely tim bodilie exercise profiteth little but godlines is profitable for much againe as god kingdome is so must his worshippe be and god kingdome standeth not in outward things as in eating drink and such like actions and therefore his worship standeth not in outwarde thinges here m perkins setteth vp a rotten prop or two to vphold his ruinous building saying s paul saith plainly bodilie exercise profiteth little t godlines profiteth much where are you good sir we treat here of vowes vvhich are formally actions of the mind vvhat do you novv about bodilie exercises vovves are principall parts of that godlines vvhich is so profitable and if by bodily exercise fasting and other corporall paine or labour be vnderstood then vve say that such things of themselues vvould profitlittle but being directed to the chastising of the rebellious flesh to the end vve may lesse offend and better serue god then they may much profit vs the reason why master perkins brings this place is because as it should seeme some papists alleage it to prooue the lawfulnes of vowing bodily exercises to honor god by them you answer that vowes are actions of the minde what of that if the performance of the vowes be of small profit doubtlesse the vowing of them is a poore piece of seruice to god yet may there be good vse of fasting and such like to vs in that they may be made good meanes to further our seruice to god though of themselues they be no worship bu let vs heere m perkins his second reason against such vovves god kingdome standeth not in outvvard things and therfore his vvorship standeth not in outvvard things ans god kingdome in itselfe standeth not in outvvard things and as it is in vs also it doth consist chiefly in inward worship by faith hope charity and religion in vvhose kingdome vovvs hold a honorable ranke but a great part of this vvorship among vs depends of outvvard things for be not the tvvo only parts of god vvorship among protestant as m perknis saith in this question baptisme and our lord supper both vvhich partly consist in outvvardly both speaking and doing and is not faith vvhich is the roote of all christian religion gotten by outvvard preaching and hearing but it vvould vvearie a vvilling man to trayle after all m perkins his impertinent errors the kingdome of god stands not in such outward actions as eating drink ampc master perkins denyes not that we are to performe outward worship to god which consists among vs in prayer prayse thanksgeuing and such like duties not onely as you would haue your followers falsely imagine of vs in administring and receiuing the sacraments you that would seeme so vnwilling to traile after master perkins errors are glad to make some of your owne and father them vpon him least ofttimes you should haue nothing to say i haue shewed diverse particulars of this kind in the course of my answere to your cauils against him iii point of difference they maintaine such vowes to be made as are not agreeable to the rules before named and herein also wee are to dissent from them the first and principall is the vowe of continencie whereby a man promiseth to god to keepe chastitie alwaies in single life that is out of the estate of wedlocke this kind of vowe is flat against the word of god and therefore unlawful for paul saith corinthian if they cannot conteine let them marric tim it is a doctrine of deuills to forbid to marrie heb marriage is honorable among all and the bed vndefiled this kind of vovv is flat against the vvord of god as hesaith vvhich he proueth first out of s paul if they cannot containe then let marrie true if they haue not vovved chastitie before as the common christians of corinthian to vvhom s paul there speaketh had not for such f they cannotliue othervvise chastly it is better they marry then be burned that is defiled vvith incontinencie but to them vvho had vovved chastitie before s paul vvriteth in another stile that if they but desire to marrie they incurre domnation because they haue made frustrate and broken their former faith and promise made vnto god of their chastiue so that this first text is a furlong vvide at the least from the marke the text is generall and implies no such exception epiphanius holds it to be a better course for them that haue vowed to marry then to continue in sinne against god and aug de bono viduit ca austin saith that the marriages of such man are not to be condemned as if they were no marriages at all which opinion that they are no marriages he there refutes and indeede who can thinke in any reason that it is more displeasing to god for a man to breake the promise he hath made then by making a shew of keeping it to liue in vncleannes it is but one fault to breake a vow though it be neuer so lawful but it is a double fault both to do against the vow by continuing subiect to such lusts and to refuse the remedie that is afforded in which respect epiphan vbi supra epiphanius saith it is better to haue one sinne then many sinnes therefore cyril in leuit lib cyrill giueth councell to marry euen after the vow of single life and to confesse our sinne in so doing if we cannot liue chastly yes q i malis the common law bids a man not to do that which he hath vowed vnaduisedly it is no doubt a fault not to keepe our vow but to make such a vow as a man is not sure he shall be able to keepe is a greater fault if the case fall out to be so hieron ad act ierome and q austen hold it the lesse euill to marry it cannot be prooued out of the text that the apostle speaketh there of any votaries but only of such widowes as hauing for a time employed themselues in the seruice of the church at the last left both the church and christ and followed sathan by marrying with infidel but take it as you will we haue already seene the iudgement of the auntients who for all their high conceipt of virginitie allow marriage euen after vowes the second is much like it is a doctrine of diuels to forbid to marie truth if one should hold mariage in it selfe to be wicked and therefore condemne it in all sorts of persons as montanus and the manichees did but we haue a more reuerend opinion of marriage than the protestant themselues for we with the apostle hold it to be a great sacram they that it is a morail contract only notwithstanding we maintaine that such persons who being of ripe yeeres haue aduisedly vowed chastitie may not marry not because marriage is not honorable but for that they haue solemnly promised to god the contrarie which we also hold to be better tha if he had maried and so to vse s augustines words h forbiddeth to marry vvho sayeth it to be euill but not be vvho before this good thing preferreth a better and a little after you see saith he that there is great difference betweene persvvasion to virginity by preserring the greater good before the lesse and forbidding to marrie by accusing lying togither for issue the first is the doctrine of the apostles which we teach the latter only of diuels the tim apostle speaketh of all forbidding marriage at the least as an vncleane thing but so it is forbidden by you because it defiles your priests that they cannot be fit to offer vp ther maker yes that they cannot pray as harding against the apology in juel sol harding saith you take marriage for such a sacrament that it is too base for your holy priesthood we acknowledge it to be gen ampc the ordinance of god of another manner of bond then a morall contract only we deny not that single life is in some respects to be preferred before marraige but that marriage is to be forbidden any sort of man as if of it selfe it made them lesse holy the strength of this place lyeth in a double corruption of the text for this verbe is is not in the text nor cannot by the courle of the apostles speech requiring a verbe of the imperatiue mood as both the sent nces before and after do conuince the sentences before and after prooue no such thing rather the opposition in the hebr later part of the verse shewes that it should be is marriage is honorable but whoremongers and adulterers god will iudge whereas if it had bin so intended as you would haue it the other part must haue bin for god will iudge by way of a reason as your vulgar translation reades it without ground if we corrupt the text by adding the verb is what do theodoret chrysost theophyl oecum heuten ad hebr theodoret chrysostom theophylact oecumenins and heutenius the papist that translated him hesych in leuit lib cap hesychius fulgent ad galla de statu viduit cap fulgentius damasc orthod fidei lib cap damas en who so expound it primas ad hebr primasius giues the reason why the apostle speaketh so because some at that time condemned mariage as vncleane againe if you will haue the apostle say that marriage is honorable among all man we must also needs take him to say that the bedde is also vndefiled among all which was not true also that their conuersation was without couetousnes ampc for there is no reason why this word is should be ioyned with the one more than with the other and nothing but passion doth cause them to make the middle sentence an affirmatiue when they turne both the other into exhortations there is great reason why it should be ioyned with the one as hath been shewed with the other as you ioyne it it is absurd but it must thus be ioyned that is honorable be repeated and the bed vndefiled is honorable in the sentence following it cannot be vnderstood with any reason and therefore the vulgar latin sint vulgar latin puts in sint and the rhemis english let be rhemists english let be which in the former verse neither of them doth you so interpret it the second corruption is in these words among all when they should translate in all and the adiectiue being put without a substantiue must in true construction haue this word things ioyned with it and not man wherfore the text being sincerely put into english it would carrie no colour of their error for the apostles saying is let marriage be honorable in all things and the bed vndefiled here is no willing of any man to marrie but only a commandement to them that be married to liue honestly in marriage to keepe as he else where saith their vessels in sanctification and not in dishonor and then shall their marriage be honorable in all things that is in all points appertaining to matrimonie so that now you see that m perkins is not able to bring any one place out of scripture to disproue the vow of chastitie the adiectiue may be as well the masculine as the newter and that which followeth in the other part of the verse of whoremongers and adulterers directs vs to expound it of the persons so doth theophyl ibid theophyl vnderstand it in all saith theophylact is not onely in man of riper age and not in young man also but in all man or in all meanes and times not in affliction onely and in rest otherwise not honourable and pretious in this part in that part otherwise but the whole throughout is honourable so that both your cauils at the translation are vaine and the sense is wholy for vs the scripture being so barren for him he shall be like recompence it with the abundant testimony of antiquitie in fauour of his cause but oh vnhappy chance he hath cleane forgotten in this question the record of the auncient church what was there not one father who vvith some one broken fragment of a sentence or other would releeue you in this your combate against the vow of chastitie i will help you to one but i feare me you will scarse thanke me for my paines it is such a one as is neither holy nor father but the auncient christian epicure jouinian who as s augustine hath recorded and saint ierom did hold that virginity of professed persons man and woman was no better then the continencie of the married so that many professed virgin beleeuing him did marrie yet himselfe did not marrie as fryer luther did not be cause he thought chastitie should be rewarded in the life to come with a greater crowne of glory but because it was fit for the present necessity to auoid the troubles of marriage see iust the very opinion of m perkins and our protestant but this heresie saith s augustine in the same place was quicklie suppressed and extinguished it was not able to deceiue any one of the priests and in another place thus he speaketh of iouinian holy church most faithfully and valiantly resisted this monster so that no maruaile if that m perkins could find smal reliefe in antiquitie for this his assertion which the best of them esteemed no better than a monstrous sacrilegious heresie but the fathers are not for vs what then is nothing true that cannot be confirmed by their testimonie then are there very many vntruths in popery indeed it is one of the blemishes of the ancient writers that they were too highly conceited of single life the vse whereof a kinde of necessitie bred at first by reason of persecution experience of constant profession confirmed and opinion of holinesse thereupon at the last perfected so that it is not to be lookt for that antiquitie should affoord vs any testimonie against the practise and iudgement of those daies and yet it is apparant in those places i alleaged before and diverse other that neither the clergie as you call it was bound to make any such vow and that after it was made it was held a lesse sinne to breake it than to continue it in vncleannes which tained then to vow but first to vow and then to looke for strength from god to fit vs for the keeping of our vow is against all diuinitie and reason and therefore the perswasion to vow vpon presumption of abilitie to performe that which is vowed shewes at the least zeale without knowledge and can be no matter of commendation to the ancient church if they simply allowed it howsoeuer they were farre better than you because they enioyned breach of vow rather than encrease of sinne but to the further confirmation of this point let vs heare what the holy fathers teach touching the possibilitie of this vow you labour to disprooue master perkins antecedent by the testimonie of the ancient writers to which i answere in generall that as wee freely acknowledge their authoritie where there is nothing but mes authoritie to be waighed so we account it lighter than nothing in all cases contrarie to scripture such as we can prooue this to be tertullian neere the end expounding these words he that can take let him take chuse saith h that vvhich is good if thou say thou canst not it is because thou vvilt not for that thou mightest if thou vvouldest he doth declare vvho hath left both to thy choise tertullia de monogam cap tertullians testimonie is not worth the answering not only because as i shewed before out of hilary his heresie discredited all his writings but because this is the booke wherein he chiefly maintaines that his heresie and blasphemie too accompting montanus the holy ghost and comforter whom our sauiour promised to send vpon his authoritie doth tertullian forbid second marriages as vncleane and brings math this place you alleage to that purpose such conscience make you of citing authorities against the truth but i answere tertullian that our sauiour hath left it to no mans choise but to his that hath receiued the gift origin vpon the same place he that vvill take this vvord that is set dovvne of chastitie let him pray for it beleeuing m that said aske and it shall be giuen you and he shall receiue it which doth plainely confute m perkins who saith that although we aske neuer so much we cannot obtaine this gift to tertullian origin may well be ioyned a man condemned of heresie or rather of many heresies by ierome austin epiphanius theophilus and a whole councill further it is strange that he should be reported to haue offered such violence to his owne bodie if he thought the gift of continencie so easie to be obtained more especially i say that origin in matth tract origin mistakes the matter for our sauiour christ bids not euery man pray for it that will haue i but him to take it that can implying that euery one cannot the promise is of things needfull such is not continencie nor conuenient for all with origin agreeth s ierome vpon the same place who saith it is giuen vnto them vvho haue requested

of recompence and also comforted vvith a vertuous conscience chrysost in matth honul chrysostoms rhetorike is better in this place than his logicke our sauiour exhorts them that can to take it he saith not euery man that will may those are they which haue made themselues chast who hauing the gift of continencie from god vse it accordingly and forbe are marriage that they may with more cheerefulnes and lesse incumbrance serue god yet is there no shadow of any proofe in this place that euery one may vow continencie we will wrappe vp this point with s augustine who directly confuteth m perkins by many reasons and exampl lib de ada erinis coning cap et de bono vid ap and vpon the psalme an hundreth thirtie seauen he yeeldeth another reason why god will more really a them saying he that exhorteth thee to vo will helpe thee to fulfill it all which heauenly doctrine because it is spiritually iudged as the apostle speaketh the carnall man cannot vnderstand and therefore m perkins being perswaded that few can liue chastly except they marrie auoucheth that this vovv doth bring forth innumerable abhominations in the world not the hundreth part so many as the fleshly heretikes imagine and out of flying and lying tales report and bru te abroad nay i dare affirme that let the authenticall records of our realme be well perused and you shall find more lewde filthie lecherie to haue been practised by ministers and their wiues this last age than was in a thousand yeere before by all the catholike priests and religious persons of the land there is not a word of this place either aug de a ulter coniug cap in that twelfth chapter or in any part of that booke how then doth saint austin directly confute master perkins by many reasons and examples the question propounded by pollentius and there handled by austin is whether the apostle corinthian forbid her to marrie who is departed from her husband though not because of fornication in aug de bono viduit c the other place austin shewes no more but this that it is possible to refraine from fornication and adulterie which it neuer came into our minde to denie but this is not enough to chastitie and continencie if the ancient fathers hereto fore and you now count al them chast that defile not their body with outward vncleannes of that kinde monstrous filthinesse may bee chastitie but admit which wee grant may be and like enough hath been in many carnall man yes is perhaps at this day in some turkes and other heathen that the outward act should be vtterly for borne yet may they that so forbeare burne in continuall lust and liue in the breach of god commandements what doth this discourse of austins then concerne that which master perkins affirmes when he is readie to grant as much as austin saith and yet holds his former conclusion that chastitie and continencie are vertues of god speciall gift and not matters to be attained to by euery one that wil vow to continue vnmarried in hope to prooue able to keepe his vow august in psalm this third place is like the first alleaged by you without any ground at all for there is no such speech in that commentarie nor any occasion of it in the psalme the likeliest place for it in his exposition of the psalmes is vpon the psalm psalme where hee discourses of the vow of continencie at large but there it is not so that it is not to be taken for austins till you bring better proofe that it is his if i would answere at adventure i could say that god exhorts none to this vow but them on whom he hath bestowed the gift and they haue his helpe to fulfill that they haue vowed we envy not this your speciall iudgement nor respect your slanderous challenge onely this i answere that if all the ministers and their wiues had been as lewd as your malice can imagine they could not haue come neere the thousand part of that filthines which your bishops priests friers and nunnes committed in this land by record of popish history yes let iust triall be made and we will adventure our liues that time for time there haue been since the renewing of the gospell more and more beastly vncleane persons among your popes cardinals bishops priests monkes friers and nunnes in that one citie of rome than among al the ministers and their wiues in this whole realme of england yet here marke in what manner we doe it first of all though wee mislike the vowe yet wee like and commend single life marriage indeed is better in two respects first because god hath ordained it to bee a remedie of continencie to all such persons as cannot containe secondly because it is the seminarie both of church and common wealth and it bringeth forth a seede of god for the inlarging of his kingdome yet single life in them that haue the gift of continencie is in some respects to bee preferred first because it brings libertie in persequution thus paul saith corinthian i suppose it to be good for the present necessitie for a man so to bee secondly because it frees man from the common cares molestations and distractions that bee in the familie verse such shall haue trouble in the flesh but i spare you thirdly because single parties doe commonly with more bodilie ease and libertie worship god it beeing still presupposed that they haue the gift of continencie verse the vnmarried woman careth for the things of of the lord that shee may be holy both in bodie and spirit againe though wee mislike the vowe yet wee hold and teach that man or woman being assured that they haue the gift of continencie may constantly resolue and purpose with themselues to liue and lead a single life corinthian hee that standeth firme in his owne heart that hee hath no neede but hath power of his owne will and hath so decreed in his heart that he will keepe his virginitie he doth well and wee imbrace the saying of theodoret on tim cap for he doth not saith he blame single life or continencie but he accuseth them that by law enacted compel man to follow these and man made themselues chast for the kingdome of heauen matth not by vowe but by a purpose of heart which is farre lesse then a vow and may be changed vpon occasion where as a vow cannot vnlesse it doe euidently appeare to bee unlawful thirdly for such persons as are able to containe to liue single for the endes before named indeede we hold it to bee no counsell of perfection yet doe wee not denie it to bee a counsell of expedience o outward ease according to that which paul saith verse i giue mine aduise and i speake this for your commoditie not to intangle you in a snare lastly we thinke that if any hauing the gift of continencie doe make a vow to liue single and yet afterward marrie the said gift remaining they haue sinned yet not because they are married but because their vowe is broken and thus said augustine of widowes that married after their vow lib de bono viduit c this may serue for a reproofe of all that m perkins obiecteth against the vovv of chastitie aftervvard the man vvould somewhat reason the matter by shevving hovv he condemneth not chastitie yet saith that marriage is better than it in two respects if iouinian was reputed by the learnedst and holiest fathers a christian epicure and a monster because he durst make marriage equall vvith virginitie what shall this man be who saith it is better his reasons are so childish that by the like you may proue durt to be better then gold vvherefore i vvill not stand vpon them he neuerthelesse aftervvard concludeth that one may purpose constantly vvith himselfe to lead a single life but so as he may change vpon occasion and this to be a counsell of expedience but not of perfection lastly that if any hauing the gift of continencie do vovv and atfervvard mark ie the gift remaining they haue sinned vvhich is flat against his ovvne second rule vvhich prohibits vs to leese our libertie and to make any thing vnlavvfull in conscience vvhich christian religion leaueth at libertie novv to supplie m perkins his default vvho vvas accustomed to rehearse although many times vntowardly yet lightlie alvvaies some reasons for the catholike partie vvhich in this question he hath vvholie omitted he that will but reade what master perkins writes and what you answere shall see a true image of popish dealing whereby you slubber ouer the matter to which you know not what to say is it a wrong to single life or virginitie to hold that marriage in some respect is better then it i will go further then master perkins hath done and not doubt to affirme that it is simply better then virginitie my reason is that it belongs to the perfection of humaine nature that there should be continuance and multiplying of the kind by propagation beside god appointed it as an especiall blessing for adam when he was in god especiall fauour but if that estate be worse then the single life in which he liued before god did not blesse but punish him rather by that change therefore marriage simply is better but that virginitie might haue his due master perkins sets downe presently after three respects wherein it is to be preserred before marriage all which you do not once name those christian fathers dealt vnchristianly with iouinian who ascribed as much to virginitie as our sauiour christ or his apostles gaue to it in any place of scripture according to that conclusion of theodoret decret diuin de virginit theodoret who ends his discourse of virginitie with these words such things we haue receiued being appointed and decreed by man endued with the knowledge of heauenly things which are such as do not accuse marriage but exhort vs to a life void of cares this iouinian acknowledged and worthily denied all difference of merit between a married and single life which no enemy of iouinian can disproue no more can you master perkins reasons though you disgrace them all you can i vvill briefelie proue by an argument or tvvo that it is both lavvfull and verie commendable for man and vvomen of ripe yeeres and consideration hauing vvell tried their ovvne aptnesse to vovv virginitie if by good inspirations they be thereunto invvardly called my first reason is this that vvhich is more pleasant and gratefull vnto god may verie vvell be vovved to him but virginitie is more acceptable to god then marriage the first proposition is manifest and hath no other exception against it but that vvhich before is confuted to vvit if vve be able to performe it the second is denied by them vvhich vve proue in expresse tearmes out of s paul he that ioyneth his virgin doth vvell but he that ioyneth her not doth better and againe of widdowes they shall be more happie by s pauls iudgement if they remaine vnmarried this may be confirmed our of esay where god promiseth the eunuch that holdeth greatlie of the thing that pleaseth him that he vvill giue him in his houshold and vvithin his vvalles a better heritage and name than if they had bin called sonnes and daughters i vvill saith god giue them an euerlasting name and also out of the booke of wisdome blessed is the eunuch which hath vvrought no vnrighteousnesse ampc for vnto him shall be giuen the speciall gift of faith and the most acceptable portion in our lord temple for glorious is the fruit of god which is also plainlie taught in the reuelations where it is said that no man could sing that song but and the cause is set dovvne these be they vvhich haue not been defiled vvith vvomen for they are virgin to these latter places m perkins anivvereth page that to the eunuch is promised a greater revvard but not because of his chastity but because he keepeth the lord sabbath and couenant but this is said vnaduisedly for to all others that keepe god commanments shall be giuen a heauenly revvard but vvhy shall they haue a better heritage and more acceptable portion than others but because of their speciall prerogatiue of chastity what needs that be prooued which wee graunt it is questionles lawful for such as being free find themselues fitted by god to single life to resolue vpon the continuance of it as long as they shall be in that case but i doubt your reasons are scarce good the first hath a suspitious assumption because it implies that single life of it selfe should please god better then marriage which theodoret decret diuin de virginit amp ad corinthian i haue shewed to be false to your proofe i answere that the happines the apostle speakes of is that which theodoret vbi supra theodoret names viz being without care and hauing more free liberty to serue god as he prooues out of the apostle himselfe who sheweth by his whole discourse that he prefers that single life before the married only in regard of the present times and opportunitie of seruing god generally this corinthian verse vers saith he is good for the present necessitie verse such shall haue trouble in the flesh i would haue you without care the vnmarried careth for the things of the lord that of esai esay prooues nothing to the purpose for the prophet speakes not of them that had made any vow of continencie but of such as were made eunuches by man against their wils to whom he makes promise not for their continencie which was no way voluntary but for their keeping of his sabbaths and choosing the thing that pleaseth him and taking hold of his couenant the eunuch and the gentile saith lyra ad esai lyra comming to faith shall obtaine as much grace and glory other things alike now these young widdows if the protestant doctrine were true not hauing the gift of continencie did very well to marrie and were in no sort bound to keepe their vowes which vvas not in their povver but the apostle doth not acquit them of their vow but teacheth that they were bound to keepe it in that he pronounceth damnation to them if they marry it must be prooued that there was such a vow made to christ before it can be truly affirmed that the tim apostle speakes of it in this place the first faith or vow of a christian to god is that generall promisse of obedience in baptisme or the vndertaking of the profession of christianitie as it appeareth by hieron in prooem in epistle ad tit ierome speaking of marcion and basilides two infamous hereticks they are not worthie of credit saith ierome they haue forsaken their first faith but if you will needs referre this to the matter there particularly in question the fault is not leauing to be a widow but forsaking the calling in the church which they had of their own will vndertaken this necessarily ensued vpon their marriage because only widowes had that office of looking to the poore and diseased it is farther to be obserued that the apostle seemes to lay the fault vpon their wilfull wantonnes and not to graunt that there was any necessitie of vsing marriage for a remedie when such a case falls out it is the iudgement of the auntient writers that it is better to marry then to continue in vncleanes wee must saith ad demetriadem virginem ierome plainely charge vowed virgin whose behauiour defames and shames the holy purpose of virgin and the glory of the heauenly and angelicall family that either they marry if they cannot conteine or conteine if they will not marry they marry not saith de sancta virginit cap austin because they cannot without rebuke yet better were it for them to marry then to burne it may happen saith a ae q article thomas that in some case a vow may be either vtterly ill or vnprofitable or an hinderance vnto some other good thing of greater waight and therefore it must of necessitie be determined that in such a case a vow ought not to be kept an adulterers case saith lib epistle cyprian is worse then his that hath betrayed the faith and ambrose when he had said that a vowed virgin if she haue a mind to marry committeth adultery and is made the handmaid of death yet addes afterwards that she is twice an adulteresse which is defiled with secret and priuie filthines faining her selfe to be that which indeed she is not thirdly the example of our heauenly sauiour who would neuer marrie and of the blessed virgin s mary vvho vovved perpetuall virginitie and of the glorious apostles as who s rome vvitnesseth vvere in part virgin and all after their follovving of christ abstained from the company of their wiues and of the best christians in the purest antiquitie vvho as iustinas one of the auncientest greeke authors among christians and tertullian his peere among the latins doe testifie did liue perpetuall virgin out of these examples vve frame this argument our captaines and ring leaders vvho knew well which vvas the best vvay and whose examples vve are to follovv as neere as vve can vovving virginity vve must needs esteeme that state for more perfect speciallie vvhen as the single man careth only hovv to please god that to be holy in bodie and mind as the apostle writs vvhen as the married are choked vvith cares of this vvorld and vnlesse a man had made a league vvith hell or vvere as blind as a beetle hovv can he euer persvvade himselfe that to vvallovv in fleshly pleasure and satisfying of the beastly apperites is as gratefull to god as to conquere and subdue them by fasting and prayer our captaines and ringleaders say you vowed virginitie therefore we must needs thinke the state of virginitie more perfect then that of marriage first i denie your antecedent neither our sauiour nor his mother nor his apostles vowed virginitie prooue it of any of them if you can indeede our sauiour was neuer married and all man may easily see it was no way fit he should be his mother was and therefore questionles neuer made any such vow of single life though we beleeue that as it was very fit it should be she continued a virgin till her death that some of the apostles had wiues it is apparant by scripture that they kept them after their office vndertaken it is more then likely by corinthian vxorem saith vatablus as indeed the order of the ords requires the like warrant of scripture whatsoeuer some haue thought without any sufficient ground of reason or authoritie to the contrarie peter and philip saith stromat lib pag clement of alexandria had children philip also bestowed his daughters in marriage and paul non veretur suam appellare coniugem is not afraid in a certaine epistle of his to mention his wife whom he did not leade about with him because he non ma no ei opus esset ministerio had no neede of any great seruice your consequence also is very weake they were virgin therefore it was a state of greater perfection it was more fit for those times and their occasions yes we graunt it is a freer kind of life for god seruice and therefore they that can liue so do well to vse that their libertie but this prooues not that single life is simply better then marriage that which you adde of wallowing in filthie pleasure and satisfying of the beastly appetites bewraies the beastlie opinion you haue of marriage and shewes that you would be filthy though you were married what you are now as i know not so i will not iudge but this i will say that few or no married man liue so vnchastlie and abhominablie as see d downame of antichrist lib c corinthian many of your vowed virgin haue done by record of your owne stories finally if s paul giue counsell to the married to conteine during the time of prayer priests and religious that must alvvaies be in a readines to minister the sacraments and to thinke vpon such things as belong vnto our lord are therefore vpon a great consideration bound to perpetuall chastitie the apostle giueth no such counsaile but forbids the married the restraining of each others company except it be for a time that they may giue themselues to fasting and prayer the reason is that at such speciall times speciall humiliation is requisite to which the forbearing all kind of lawful pleasure is a principall furtherance otherwise the moderate vse of marriage is no hinderance to any dutie either of christianitie or the ministrie but a speciall meanes to preserue necessarie chastitie we vvill close vp this point vvith some sentences taken out of the auncient fathers in praise of virginity vvhich master perkins in all this question vouchsafeth scarce once to name as though virgin and virginitie vvere no english vvords or not as plaine as continencie wee acknowledge that virginitie where it is pure as it ought to be is worthie of very singular commendation but it consists not onely in abstaining from the outward act of marriage master perkins did very well approue both of the thing and the word but because it was not general enough for this question as not reaching to all that were single he rather chose to vse the word continencie being of larger extent s cyprian de habitu virginum intitleth virgin to be the most noble and glorious person of christs flocke and addeth that they shall receiue of god the highest revvard and greatest recompence saint chrysostom saith virginitie to be the top of perfection and the highest typ of vertue and athanasius de virginitate in the end bursteth out into these vvords o virginitie a treasure that vvasteth not a garland that wythereth not the temple of god the palace of the holy ghost a pretious stone whose price is vnknown to the vulgar the ioy of the prophets the glory of the apostles the life of angels the crovvne of saints s ambrose lib de virginibus paulo post init virginity is a principall vertue and not therefore commendable that it is found in martyrs but because it maketh martyrs who can with humane vvit comprehend it vvhich nature doth not hold vvithin her lavves it hath fetched out of heauen that it might imitate on earth neither vnsitly hath it sought a manner of life in heauen vvhich hath found a spouse for her in heauen this surmounting the clouds the starres and angels hath found the vvord of god in the bosome of his father ampc see vvho list to reade more to this purpose the rest of the fathers in their vvorkes of virginitie of vvhich most of them haue vvritten and s ierome who is behind none of the rest in his bookes against iouinian and heluidius all vvhich doe most diligently exhort to vovv virginitie do teach hovv to keepe it and most vehemently inueigh against all them that do breake it and if any be so mad as to credit rather our fleshly ministers than all that honorable and holy senate of the auncient fathers he deserueth to liue and die in perpetuall darknesse in this matter i haue stayed some vvhat longer because our carnall teachers vvith the levvde example of their dissolute disciples haue corrupted ourage vvith fleshly and beastly libertie in the other points i vvi l recompence it with breuitie these hyperbolicall commendations of virginitie shew the opinion of some ancient writers concerning it but prooue nothing we disswade no man from continuing a single life so hee bee able to ouercome that burning which the apostle condemnes yes rather wee exhort them that haue the gift to vse it but we denie either that all haue it or that they which haue it doe please god any more by the vse of it that they that haue it not but as they employ it to the better and more free seruing of god the second is the vow of pouertie and monasticall life in which man bestow all they haue on the poore and giue themselues wholy and onely to prayer and fasting this vowe is against the will of god act it is a more blessed thing to giue then to receiue pro giue me neither riches nor pouerty deut pouertie is numbred among the curses of the law none whereof are to be vowed and it is the rule of the holy ghost thess he that will not labour namely in some speciall and warrantable calling must not eate and verse i exhort that they worke with quietnes and eate their owne bread now when as man liue apart from others giuing themselues onely to prayer and fasting they liue in no calling and it is against the generall vowe made in baptisme because it freeth man from sundrie duties of the morall law and changeth the proper ende of mans life for euery man must haue two callings the first is a general calling of a christia by vertue of which he performeth worship vnto god and duties of loue to man the second is a particular calling wherein according to his gift he must doe seruice to man in some function pertaining either to the church or common wealth whereof he is a member and the first of these twaine must be performed in the second and the second in and with the first the end of mans life is not onely to serue god by the duties of the first table but by seruing of man in the duties of the second table to serue god and therefore the loue of our neighbour is called the fulfilling of the whole law rom because the law of god is practised not apart but in and with the loue of our neighbour this beeing so it is manifest that vowed pouertie in monkish life makes many vnprofitable members both of church and commonwealth concerning the vovv of pouertie and monasticall life in vvhich as m perkins acknovvledgeth man bestovv all they haue vpon the poore and giue themselues to prayer and fasting yet he is not ashamed to auouch that this vow is against the vvill of god and assaieth to proue it act cap verse it is a more blessed thing to giue than to receiue ans as the verie proposition that it is displeasing to god to cut off all cares of the vvorld and to betake our selues vvholy to his holy seruice and contemplation of heauenly matters is in it selfe profane and vngodly so the proofe thereof is deuoid of naturall wit and sense marke the argument it is against god vvill to giue avvay all because it is more blessed to giue than to receiue why if it be a more blessed thing to giue then they please god better that giue so that this his proofe improues flatly his ovvne assertion but the dreamer meanes perhaps that if you giue all at once you shall not be able to giue aftervvard but rather stand in need to receiue reply but no such humane prudence can be dravven out of that sentence vvhich encourageth rather to giue for the present then to prouide for hereafter the true meaning of the place is to exhort christians to labour and trauaile at vacanttimes to get their ovvne liuing and to prouide some thing also to bestovv vpon them vvho stand in need rather then to be idle and to stand in need of almes as s paul himselfe did vvhich they did best performe vvho had sold all they had and distributed it to the poore as the example of paul himselfe and the first christians doth sufficiently declare vvho sold all and laid the price at the apostles feete the proposition is true that it is displeasing to god for a man to seuer himselfe from all cares of the world to serue him in contemplation without respect of any dutie to his brother for the cares of the world are part of euery mans lot in this life and the philipp good of our brother is to be preferred for a time before our owne happinesse in heauen neither is any seruice of praying and fasting continually so much to god glorie as a christian carriage in some lawful calling the argument is good for he that giues away that vpon which he should liue as your votaries doe brings himselfe into a lesse blessed estate to liue on other mens almes than spirit the like is to be said of hungring and thirsting being full and satisfied which followeth in the same place thus m perkins his texts of scripture against pouerty failing him he fetcheth about another vvay saying that it is a rule of the holy ghost he that vvill not labour namely in some speciall and vvarrantable calling must not eate ans i allow both the text and the glosse and finde nothing there against religious persons whose calling is speciall perfect and therefore best warrantable not so saith he because they giue themselues to prayer and fasting what a profane stupiditie is this is not a life giuen to praier and fasting agreeable to the wil of god and laws of his church albeit many religious man doe ouer and besides very great seruices to god church in preaching teaching amp writing of most learned books but suppose they did nothing else but fast and pray did they not verie well deserue their sustenance yes much better than they which trauaile all the yeere about the prouiding of it for in vaine do man labour if god blesse not their worke with seasonable weather which he doth rather at the prayer and instance of such good innocent soules that are to be fed with it than for the plough mans owne labours sake and if by their fasting watching and such like afflictions of their body they do partly satisfie for our superfluous pampering of the flesh and teach vs by their good example to bridle and correct it doe they not deserue at our hands bodily sustenance and who better performes all duties of the second table than they being most obedient to all their superiours and not hurting their neighbour in life persons or any manner of their goods and so in their seuerall callings offend no honest man and doe much good both vnto the church and common wealth it is no lawful calling nor agreeable to the will of god that any man should liue in the church without any charge or meanes to profit the church by fasting and praying are both lawful and acceptable but they are generall duties of all christians and may not therefore be made proper callings of certaine man for callings differ as other things by their speciall forme but their praying and fasting is diverse from the same exercise practised by other christians onely in quantitie more or lesse the seruices these man doe beside are meerely voluntarie and not lying vpon them by any dutie of their calling which is onely i know not what stinted deuotion after the lawes of each seuerall order of monkes friers nunnes and such like they no way deserue their sustenance since they haue vowed to take no course whereby they may prouide for it their prayers do no good no not so much as to themselues being made with a proud opinion to merit by a conceited perfection a poore husbandman that labours all the week for his liuing and vseth the best meanes he can to grow in knowledge and obedience to god may looke for a greater blessing from god vpon his bodily and spirituall labours by his owne poore prayers and the supplications of the congregation in which he liueth than by all the fasting and praying of the holiest couent abbey or nunnerie in the country as for their satisfactions they are like a broken reede which will not onely faile him that trusts to it but hurt him also i haue shewed that we neede no other satisfaction being deliuered by our sauiour christs sufferings and there are few or none except perhaps the begging friers that had not more neede to satisfie for their owne idlenesse and gluttonie than ordinarily any other kinde of man whatsoeuer if wee may beleeue either the reports of trauellers or the records of your owne history can they be said to be obedient to their superiours that in the very making of their vow oftentimes wilfully disobey their fathers and mothers or may they be thought to hurt none who liue idle vpon the sweate of other mens browes and are onely a charge to the state whereof they are vnprofitable members but not to hurt is a kindnes perhaps to be commended in theeues what due praise it can haue in a state of perfection for my part i cannot see which i speake vpon supposition that they are not so hurtfull to man and woman as it is commonly thought and though we mislike this vow also yet we doe it holding these conclusions first that a man may forsake all his goodes vpon speciall calling as the apostles did when they were sent to preach the gospell through the whole world secondly goodes may bee forsaken yes wife children parents brother and all in the case of confession that is when a man for the religion of christ is persecuted and constrained to forsake all he hath for then the second table giues place to the duties of the first mark ii that for the time of persecution man may withdraw themselues iust occasion offered and goe apart to wildernesses or like places hebr yet for the time of peace i see no cause of solitarie life if it bee alleadged that man goe apart for contemplation and spirituall exercises i say againe that god grace may as wel be exercised in the familie as in the cloister the familie is indeede as it were a schoole of god in which they that haue but a sparke of grace may learne and exercise many vertues the acknowledgement of god inuocation the feare of god loue bountifulnes patience meekenesse faithfulnes ampc nay here bee more occasions of doing or taking good then be or can be in a cloister iii that wee condemne not the old and ancient monks though we like not euery thing in them for they liued not like idle bellies but in the sweate of their owne browes as they ought to zozom lib cap epiph bar august de mon eccl li c amp de opere monach cap doe and many of them were married and in their meat drinke apparrell rule vow and whole course of life differed from the monks of this time euen as heauen from earth after all this wast wind m perkins confesseth that a man may vpon a speciall calling s ll all his goods as the apostles did what then good sir shal become of your former arguments may one then vow a curse of the law and leaue off prayer for neither pouertie nor riches and say that it is not a blesseder thing to giue then to receiue all these arguments which were whilom of great force must now be nothing worth because it pleaseth m perkins the wind now sits in an other corner such weather cockes surely are to be much respected master perkins speakes not a word of selling all a man hath but of forsaking it when hee hath some calling from god which requireth such a course for the following of it as will not affoord a man leisure to looke to his worldly affaires but this is no wilfull casting away the care of our estate but preferring the duties especially laid on vs by god before our owne businesse neither is it any vowing of pouertie with a fond conceit of perfection but a faithfull labouring in our necessarie calling with neglect of the world in comparison of our dutie in such a case a man must relie on god prouidence and vse the best meanes he can to prouide for himselfe that he may not be chargeable to other but helpfull rather not renouncing all propriety in worldly things but carefully sauing and thriftily spending that which it pleaseth god to send by any good meanes whatsoeuer this ouerthrowes no peece of any argument master perkins brought before he faith further in time of persecution a man may also leaue all he should rather haue said he must leaue all or else loose all for the persecutor will not spare him lastly he doth not condemne old auncient monks who liued by the sweat of their browes and were married many of them as he saith but his authors cited saith not so neither shall he be able to cite one auncient allowed and approued writer who saith that the auncient monkes liued with their wiues if perhaps they had been married before but no maruaile if fleshly ministers thinke it no life without their fleshly mates as for labouring at vacant times it was alwaies and is to this day in practise among many religions if other do in good studies writing or teaching imploy that time of labour no doubt but they do farre better he may and must leaue all if need be it was sufficient for master perkins purpose to shew that our goods in some cases might bee forsaken though pouertie might not bee drawne vpon vs by any proud vow of supposed perfection he doth not condemne those monkes though he thinks many things they vsed not warrantable the report was as lib cap zozomen saith that ammon the monk of egypt by the importunitie of his friends married a wife though hee neuer companied with her which how he might with good conscience refuse being married let them iudge that reade what the corinthian apostle writes of this matter yet as they say he liued with her eighteene yeeres in that course before she was brought into the liking of a monkish life but belike it was lawful then for them to marrie and no man can excuse this ammon of great sinne that would adventure to marrie one of whose continencie and willingnes to conteine hee could haue no knowledge before marriage other monkes that were married ere they became monkes could not vow without consent of their wiues if labouring at vacant times be in practise among many religions as indeed there is a multitude of religions among you papists it is but a worke of supererogation aboue their calling for their profession is idlenesse but that this will not serue the turne de oper monach c austin sheweth directly enioyning it as a matter of necessitie in defence of the catholike party m perkins hath not a word wherfore i will briefly supplie his want and proue it to be very gratefull to god to sell all and giue it to the poore i omit the example of our blessed sauiour who would not haue any poore cottage of his own so much as to rest his head in but would wholy liue of almes and come vnto his heauenly doctrine he teacheth a yong man whom he loued in flat words that if he would be perfect he should go and sell all he had and giue it to the poore and come and follow him and then should haue a treasure in heauen these words are so expresse and euident that there can be but one way to shift from them which m perkins fl eth vnto pag to wit that these words were only meant vnto that young man and not to be applied vnto any others no more than those words to abraham of sacrificing his son isaac but this seely shift of our poore protestant is confuted manifestly in the same chapter of s matthew where a little after s peter saith lord behold we haue left all things and haue followed thee what reward shall we therefore haue we haue done as s ierome expoundeth it and the very sequele of the text doth plainly require that which thou commandest in the words before to that yong man what answere made our sauiour that his commandement was only meant vnto that young man and that they had done foolishly in so doing nothing lesse but promiseth that they shall therefore sit with him in twelue seats iudging the twelue tribes of israel and that whosoeuer would forsake father mother lands goods ampc for his sake should receiue an hundreth fold and possesse life euerlasting can any thing be more plaine out of the word of god it selfe than that not this or that man but whosoeuer shall forsake all for christ doth verie blessedly if this be the best supplie that can be made who can iustly blame master perkins for saying nothing in defence of your popish partie for if all you offer to prooue were granted you all were nothing to the purpose say it bee gratefull to god to sell all and giue it to the poore doth it follow hereupon that therefore it is lawful to vow wilfull pouertie as a state of perfection i trow not but that is the question between vs you might haue done well to omit it indeede being so little to the matter for what kinde of conclusion call you this our sauiour would not haue any poore cottage of his owne therefore pouertie may be vowed as a state of perfection or therefore it is greater perfection to haue no house than to haue one our sauiour being to trauell from place to place both for the preaching of the gospell and his owne safetie thought it not conuenient to haue any certaine dwelling place yet your monkes friers and nunnes haue and those the pleasantest and richest for the soile and ayre that can be found in the whole country where they are but what did our sauiour sell that he might thereby fall into wilfull pouertie his example helps you not let vs see his doctrine he teacheth a yong man you say whom he loued that if he would be perfect he should sell all he had and giue it to the poore and follow him and then he should haue treasure in heauen first for our sauiours louing him which yet matth matthew records not but marc marke who leaues out that clause of being perfect it is more then plaine that this cannot be vnderstood of any speciall loue for neither did the man beleeue in him as the messiah and he was falsely conceited of his owne righteousnes than which nothing is a greater hinderance to saluation and therefore nothing lesse beloued by our sauiour christ this loue therefore signifies not an approbation of his vaine brag or a desire of making him perfit but either a pittying of his conceit or some kind gesture vsed towards him which later signification especially both the see nius on marc greeke and syriake words will well admit secondly i answere that our sauiour doth not intend to shew him how he may be perfect but by vrging him to sell that he had meanes to discouer his want of loue to god and his neighbour that he meant not to perswade him to any perfection it is euident first because no man without true faith which this iusticiary wanted can come any thing neere to perfection secondly for that a man may corinthian sell all that he hath ampc and yet not be perfect for single life in your account is a matter of no small perfection but our sauiour would make his vanitie in the opinion of his owne righteousnes apparant to him and other as it fell out indeed for refusing to obey him in that matter he bewrayed his couetousnes which he preferd before following our sauiour whom he acknowledged to be a worthie teacher and before the loue of his brother lastly i say the chiefe point of perfection here mentioned is not selling of our goods but following of christ which is a dutie luke belonging to all christians so that without it no man is a christian in the following of christ by the works of charity saith your lyra ad matth glosse perfection consists principally in wilfull pouertie but as in the beginning by way of renouncing that which hinders and disposing of vs because by it the care of temporall things is taken away which hinders the soule from the loue of god and the soule is fitted to free contemplation of god to sell all and giue to the poore sufficeth not to perfection saith libr ad matth ierome vnlesse after the despising of riches we follow christ that is leauing euill do good and after many leaue riches but not follow our lord he followes our lord who doth imitate him and treads in his steps and againe afterward because it sufficeth not to leaue he addes that which is perfect and haue followed me so that this is no state of perfection but rather a remedie against our being drawen away from following christ which was as necessary to saluation both before and vnder the law as it is now in this light of the gospell and if without wilfull pouerty it cannot be done doubtles neither those worthies of the former ages abraham moses dauid ampc could follow christ in duties of charitie and we not only may but must sell all we haue that we may follow him it was spoken and intended only to that yong man neither doth peter say that the apostles had sold all and giuen it to the poore which is no where recorded of them in the scriptures but that they had forsaken all and followed him that is had left their ordinarie callings by which in likelyhood they might haue thriuen to attend vpo our sauiour and to be employed in his seruice and to the following of christ either only or specially doth that of ierome belong peter speakes confidently saith libr ad matth ierome we haue left all and because it is not sufficient only to leaue he addes that which is perfect and haue followed thee we haue done that quod iussisti mat thou commaundest that is we haue giuen ouer the hope of our increase in worldly riches rather then we would not serue thee but by the way let me put you in mind if you will needs haue that speech of ieromes belong to willfull pouerty you must needs make it a commandement by your owne interpretation it is not only a counsaile but a commandement that euery man should forsake his goods rather then his profession of christianitie or any speciall dutie to which god shall call him if any man saith our luke sauiour come to me and hate not his father and mother and wife and children and brother and sisters and his owne life also he cannot be my disciple and if need were i could cite most of the auncient fathers teaching those words of christ goe and sell all to be an heauenly counsell giuen generally vnto all s antonie tooke them spoken to him in vita eius apud athanas s augustine to him ad hilarium to omit latter religious man i will only cite s jerome who doth briefely both declare our catholike doctrine and shewes also who was the author of the protestant opinion saying thus to that vvhich thou affirmest that they do better who vse their goods and doe by little and little distribute to the poore the profit of their possessions then others vvho selling them giue all at once not i but our lord shall ansvvere jf thou vvilt be perfect goe and sell all thou hast and giue it to the poore christ speaketh to him that vvill be perfect not to the young man only vvho vvith the apostles forsooke both father shippe and nettes that which thou vigilantius commendest obtaineth the second and third degree so that the first which is to sell all at once be preferred before the second and third which is to giue by little and little the fruit of our reuenues to the poore the authoritie of the antient writers is lessened by the knowledge of the ground they built vpon which was a misconceit of our sauiours speech begun at the first by some man who did not sufficiently waigh the place and continued from one to another without any due examination till it had got such strength that it carried away the best learned who contemning the world were easily perswaded to thinke themselues to be in an estate of perfection i might confirme this sormer argument with the example of the sore ide best christians who hauing possessions and lands sold all and brought the price of them and laid it at the apostles feete and more yet enforce it by the fact of ananias and saphira his wife who hauing sold all theirs presented but part of the money vnto the apostles and reserued the rest vnto themselues belike they were of m perkins his minde that it is better to giue then to receiue and therefore kept part to that purpose but they therefore were both punished with present death which proueth inuincibly both how laudable it is to sell all and how dangerous to halte in such holy workes but to auoid prolixitie i do but point at the places and that ananias as the est had promised this to god which is a vow it appeareth in the text where it is said that he lyed not vnto man but vnto god in not per orming his promise and here we deduce very cleerely that such a vow is much pleasing vnto god thus that which is commended by our sauiours owne both example and doct ine and was practised by the apostles and most holie christians that may be vowed verie laudablie but to sell all and giue it to the poore is such the example of those christians is nothing to the purpose who vpon speciall occasion made their goods common to the vse of the whole church in ierusalem yet act is it not said of them that they sold all they had yes the contrary may reasonably be gathered by the facts of act barnabas and act ananias of whom it is recorded that they sold each of them a possession that he had and laid downe the money at the apostles feete now to imagin that they had no other goods and chattels but that land nor any moueables is a conceit vnwarrantable by any reason ananias and sapphiras mind was to make a shew of more bountie then they had any will to performe that they had made any vow or promise to god of any such sale cannot be prooued by the text but rather the contrary because the apostle peter saith that it was in his choyce before he sold it whether he would sell it or no and that after he had sold it it was in his owne power viz to giue all or halfe of it as he thought good the lye he made was to say that he had brought in all the money he sold it for whereas he kept back part i haue stood the longer vpon this argument because you bring no more but this and thinke this vnanswerable therefore also beside your custome you draw it into a syllogisme now at the last that say you which is commaunded by our sauiours owne example and doctrine and was practised by the apostles and most holy christians that may be vowed very laudably but to sell all and giue it to the poore is such therefore it may be vowed very laudably i denie your proposition because some things haue bin commended and practised by our sauiour his apostles and other holy christians of which a man may not make a vow for example both he and they haue commended and indured persecution for the gospell yet doth it not follow that therefore a man may wilfully by a vow bring persecution vpon himselfe as by the vow of pouertie you cast your selues into a state of beggery your assumption also is false neither our sauiour his apostles nor other holy christians i speake of the examples you bring out of the acts haue practised any such matter as in my former answers it hath appeared to which i adde yet further that they in the acts so gaue that they did giue that themselues had their reliefe out of it if neede required as well as any other of the conclusion i say that it containes not the whole matter in question between vs though it be rightly drawne from the premisses for though we should graunt that vowes of selling all and giuing it to the poore may laudably be made which is false yet is it not proued that a man may vow wilfull pouertie and refuse to possesse any worldly goods they in the acts if they gaue all away which is al made in our creation we remember nothing of it nor neuer heard speake of it by any good author not that we make or renew any vowes when vve receiue the blessed sacrament these be but nouelties of words and the rauing of some decayed wits you vtterly mistake master perkins for he makes not comparison between your accompt of baptisme and ours but between your estimation of the vow in baptisme and these other vowes deuised by your selues and though with you the couenant in baptisme be no vow yet with ad psalm s austin it is what must we vow saith he vpon that place which you alleage to prooue the lawfulnes of vowing he answers to beleeue in him to hope for euerlasting life of him to liue well according to a common manner of liuing well the vow in our creation master perkins calls the bond by which we are tyed to obedience in respect that we hold all we haue of god by creation as the benefits sealed to vs in baptisme are renewed in the lord supper euery time we receiue it so by vs in like sort the promise or vow made in baptisme is also to be renewed which is implied in that name of the sacrament which signifieth thanksgiuing conclus i we acknowledge the ciuill vse of images as freely and truely as the church of rome doth by ciuill vse i vnderstand that vse which is made of them in the common societies of man out of the appointed places of the solemne worship of god and this to be lawful it appeareth because the artes of painting and grauing are the ordinance of god and to be skilfull in them is the gift of god as the example of bozaleel and aholiab declare exod this vse of images may bee in sundrie thinges i in the adorning and setting forth of buildings thus salomon beautified his throne with the image of lions and the lord commaunded his temple to bee adorned with the images of palme trees of pomegranates of bulles cherubes and such like ii it serues for the distinction of coynes according to the practise of emperours and princes of all nation when christ was asked matth whether it was lawful to giue tribute to cesar or no he called for a penny and said whose image or superscription is this they said cesars he then said giue to cesar the things that are cesars not condemning but approuing the stampe or image vpon his coyne and though the iewes were forbidden to make images in way of representation or worship of the true god yet the sycle of the sanctuarie which they vsed specially after the time of moses was stamped with the image of the almon tree and the potte of manna iii images serue to keepe in memorie friendes deceased whom we reuerence and it is like that hence came one occasion of the images that are now in vse in the roman church for in the daies after the apostles man vsed priuately to keepe the pictures of their friendes departed and this practise after crept into the open congregation and at last superstition getting heade images began to be worshipped conclus ii we hold the historicall vse of images to be good and lawful and that is to represent to the eye the actes of history whether they bee humane or diuine and thus we thinke the history of the bible may be painted in priuate places conclus iii in one case it is lawful to make an image to testifie the presence or the effects of the maiestie of god namely when god himselfe giues any speciall commaundement so to doe in this case moses made and erected a brasen serpent to bee a type signe or image to represent christ crucified ioh and the cherubs ouer the mercie seat serued to represent the maiestie of god to whom the angels are subiect and in the second commandement it is not simply said thou shalt not make a grauen image but with limitation thou shalt not make to thy selfe that is on thine owne head vpon thine owne will and pleasure christians saith m perkins in his first conclusion vsed priuately to keepe the pictures of their friends departed which afterward saith he by abuse came to be set in churches and vvorshipped this by the vvay is a very vvil ull peruerting of those vvords to thy selfe which cannot signifie but to thine ovvne vse that is to adore them as is plainely deelared in the text follovving it is no small aduantage that you take by reporting master perkins words as please you here as also otherwhere you set them downe by halues as if he certainely affirmed that which he doth but gather by likelyhood it is like saith he that hence came one occasion of the images that are now in vse in the romane church the most that any indifferent man can make of it is but a mistaking of the true sense vnlesse he be able to prooue that master perkins knew the meaning to be otherwise which is not to be thought of any man vpon a bare presumption it may be also he did rather so expound it because in iudg psalm diverse places of scripture where the iewes idolatry is reprooued they are charged to haue followed their owne adinuentiones inuentions as your latine translates iv the right images of the new testament which we hold and acknowledge are the doctrine and preaching of the gospell and all things that by the word of god pertaines thereto gal who hath bewitched you that ye should not obey the truth to whom iesus christ was before described in your sight and among you crucified hence it followes that the preaching of the word is as a most excellent picture in which christ with his benefits are liuely represented vnto vs and we dissent not from origin contra ce s lib who saith we haue no images framed by any base worke but by such as are brought forth and framed by the word of god namely patterns of vertue and frames resembling christians he meanes that christians themselues are the images of christians these be metaphoricall pictures not belonging to this purpose for it is one thing to describe in vvords another to expresse in liuely colours and lineaments concil constantinople vniuers actione these are the onely pictures that we need preaching of the word administring of the sacraments and considering the liues of the true saints as they are recorded in the scripture and offer themselues to our knowledge by good history and daily sight these conclusions containe as m perkins affirmeth the doctrine of the church of england vvhich i vvould beleeue if i did not see the magistrats publikely to take avvay pictures from catholiks to teare and burne the which were kept but in priuate places yes their more seruent disciples cannot abide a crosse standing by the high way side or in any neuer so profane a place but either they bea e and hale them dovvn or most despitefully deface them bevvraying indeed vnto all moderate man their cankered stomaks against him that died on the crosse vvho vvill one day vv on he pleaseth confound them but to couer this their malice they cast ouer it the mantle of zeale saying that the papists make them their god and that therefore they are to be abolished against which of the former conclusions is the practise of the magistrate that you should denie that to be our doctrine because of this not against the first nor the second for both we our selues vse them for ornament and remembrance and all your papists you speake of to religious purposes not against the third for you haue no image that god hath appointed to bee made much lesse against the fourth which allowes none of your images it would haue becommed you therefore to forbeare both the accusing of the magistrate for doing against our doctrine and the condemning of our doctrine as being other than it is for the people though many amongst them iustly mislike crosses because they are by you ordinarily abused to idolatry yet i thinke you can bring few examples of any such disorderly course and i am perswaded none at all which the magistrate hath not corrected o man blinded vvith spite against true deuotion we catholikes are a thousand times morezealous of the true honor of the liuing god than any protestant euer vvere or vvill be and that small reuerence vvhich vve yeeld vnto images is more different from the honor and obedience due vnto almighty god than the cope of heauen is distant from the center of the earth you zealous of the true honour of the liuing god whose glorie you turne into the likenes of a mortall man and of a pigeon whom you dishonor by stockes and stones whom you crush vp into a baggage wafer cake whom you deuoure and swallow downe into your bellies and cast out into a place not fit to be named there neuer was the like senselesse and barbarous idolatry among the gentiles if some reuerence you giue be small some againe is a degree at the least aboue that as the very words shew but tell me is it small reuerence to giue the same honour to the image which belongs to the partie whose image it is doe you not worship the images of the trinitie and of christ alone with diuine worship are not you they who maintaine that idolatrous second councill of nice in which carol mag de imag lib cap constantine bishop of constance in cyprus blasphemously affirmed that he receiued and embraced honourable holy and venerable images according to that seruice of adoration which he gaue to the

expedient to note here hovv in the purest antiquitie images vvere made and respected that famous image of our blessed sauiour vvhich the vvoman cured of the bloody fl xe set vp in brasse at caesarea philippi vpon a piller of stone is not vnknown vnto any that haue read the ecclesiasticall history of eusebius lib cap and how god did approue it by giuing vertue vnto an herbe when it did grow to touch the hem of that picture to cure all manner of diseases which image eusebius himselfe did see standing vntill his daies which was yeeres agoe as he there testifieth as also that he saw diverse others namely of saint peter and paul this goodly statue being most memorable both for antiquitie of it being made our sauiour yet liuing and for the miracles wrought by that herbe growing at the foot of it iulian the apostata for malice against our sauiour caused to be broken downe and set vp his owne image in the place of it but his was presently with lightning and thunder from heauen consumed into ashes and our sauiours by the christians carried into their church as witnesseth sozomenus eusebius deliuers that storie as a matter of report not knowledge they say that her house is yet to be seene and that admirable monuments of that benefit our sauiour bestowed vpon her are yet remaining and it is worth the obseruing that eusebius makes a difference between that which he knew by the gospell and that which he heard by report of her healing by our sauiour christ he speaketh thus whom we know by the holy gospels that our sauiour freed from her disease of her dwelling at caesarea philippi of her house and that image with the hearbe and vertue of it ferunt they say of the image also in particular they say this statue hath the image of iesus neither doth he affirme that he saw it himselfe it remained also saith eusebius vntill our times as it may be seene of them that goe into that citie but i wonder at your confidence that euer you would adde a word of the images of peter and paul eusebius report and iudgement being in that very place against your opinion of images let vs heare himselfe speake it may not seeme strange saith eusebius presently vpon the former words that such of the gentiles as were cured by our sauiour did these things seeing wee haue seene the images of his apostles viz of paul and peter and of christ himselfe kept painted in tables because the ancients by an heathenish custome of the gentiles were w nt in that manner to honour those whom they counted their preseruers this woman being a heathen and perhaps conuerted in her ignorance did like the rest of the heathen the miracle was receiued and deliuered by eusebius only vpon report of the continuance whereof with the images enduring he saith nothing but in this case i will onely put you in minde of that which gab biel in can lee one of your owne schoolmen writes concerning such miracles that they are wrought often times by the operation of diuels to deceiue the inordinate worshippers of such images god permitting and the infidelitie of man necessarily requiring it such might this be if there were any such sozom history lib cap sozomen notes in his preface to the storie that this destroying of iulians image shewed the power of christ and his anger against iulian but this prooues not that our sauiour had any liking of the image it was iulians malice as your selfe call it that prouoked our sauiour not the respect of the image the latter part you report very craftily as if the christians had set vp that image in their church but sozomen saith not so onely he telleth vs that when the gentiles had dragged it to peeces the christians gathered vp the peeces and laid them vp in their church where they were kept till the time of his writing another picture of our sauiours visage he himselfe is reported to haue sent vnto abgarus prince of edessa as witnesseth metaphrastes in vita constantini damascen and euagrius who doth in the same chapter rehearse a notable miracle

you mention not vpo his own but procopius credit who liued in the same age with him and writ that miracle by the report of i know not a veteribus comemorata what old man it is enough to discredit it that eusebius maketh no mentio of any such image though he writ the historie of that matter between our sauiour and abgarus at large and that as i said before out of the records of edessa where abgarus ruled if these former authors cannot procure credit to that storie what should simeon metaphrastes doe who anno coccius in thesauro catholico came some hundreds of yeeres after procopius and

all which notwithstanding we are desirous so to interpret the auncients concerning this point as that we may free them from superstition if it be possible we would gladly therfore expound their speaches of the efficacie and vertue of the crosse not of the wood nor of the forme but of the passion and sufferings of our sauiour christ corinthian gal amp ephesians philipp column in which sense the scripture speakes of it most truly and gloriously i could to this purpose alleage diverse places out of the fathers but i must needs confesse that i can bring many other out of their writings which will not beare that exposition what if i should say that they vsed it only as an outward gesture when they prayed to god for any blessing and therefore continually signed themselues as tertul de coron militis tertullian and august de ectit ath conue amp de tempor ser austin shew i could cite some places by which this coniecture might be made somewhat likely yes i could adde hereunto the iudgement of your late iesuits who coster enchir de cruce c pag acknowledge that vse of the crosse amongst them and vasquez de adora cultu lib cap number p denie that it puts any vertue into the thing that is signed but neither would this content you and many speeches of the auncients are such as can admit no such interpretation wherefore all that i will answere is this that howsoeuer the vse of crossing as it was amongst the fathers within yeares after our sauiours ascension and for a long time afterward cannot be sufficientlie warranted by any ground of scripture yet the crosse was neuer made an idoll by any outward worship amongst them as it is altogether with you papists whereupon it followes that the testimonies which you alleage out of the fathers are falsely applied by you to countenance such idolatry as they neuer dreamed of s ambrose exhort vs to begin all our vvorkes vvith the signe of the crosse to that of ambrose i answere more particularly first that your quotation of his ambr ser sermon is false for there is not a word of any such matter in all that sermon secondly that in ambr ser the place you meane he saith not we must begin all our works with the signe of the crosse but rather speaketh of prayer according as before i expounded him we must saith ambrose when we rise giue thanks to god and omne diei opus in signo facere saluatoris s in loan do euery

nourished not one of them are orderly and duly administred our protestant then that haue neither holie oyle nor sacrifice to make the crosse vpon are in pittifull taking such outward things not enioyned by our sauiour nor his apostles follow the custome of particular churches and times so that though in aug in a tract austins daies the sacrament was appointed to be so administred and otherwise the action was not r perficitur duly and orderly performed yet we may and do baptise well enough as long as we keepe the order commaunded by our sauiour and practised by his apostles baptise

greeke doctors do say of this same signe of the crosse s cyrill agreethfully vvith tertullian saying make this signe of the crosse both eating and drink both sitting and standing and walking and speaking in summe at all times saint basil accounteth this making of the signe of the crosse among some of the principall traditions of the apostles basil de spirit sanct c basil liued yeeres after the apostles and recites other customes as apostolicall traditions which haue neither any warrant by likelyhood of reason nor some of them allowance by the practise of your owne church turning to the

wine are shewed in the sacrament which forme of inuocation your church doth not obserue at your eleuation nor in any part of your masse origin yeeldeth one reason why we make this signe affirming that feare and trembling doth fall vpon the euill spirits when they see the signe of the crosse made with faith that of origin homily in cap exod origin as also many other sentences of the fathers applied by you papists to the signe of the crosse is spoken of our sauiours death vpon the crosse by a metonymy of the subiect what saith origin doe the diuels feare at what tremble they without doubt at the crosse of christ whereby he triumphed ouer them whereby they were stript of their principalitie and power feare therefore and trembling shall fall vpon the when they shall see the signe of the crosse in nobis fideliter fixed in vs by faith and the greatnes of that arme which our lord stretched out vpon the crosse as he said esay all the day long haue i stretched out my hands therefore they will not feare thee nisi videant in to crucem christi vnlesse they see in thee the crosse of christ vnlesse thou also can say gal god forbid i should glorie but in the crosse of my lord christ by which the world is crucified to me and i to the world but it is not the wooden crosse nor the signe of it that crucifieth the world but the power of our sauiours death s gregory nazianzen reporteth that the wicked apostata iulian being frighted with spirits made the signe of the crosse which he had renounced and yet it deliuered him from them it is but a report that nazianz in iulia orat quae est nazianzen makes vpon other mens credit it is saith he reported by many and non abhorret ab illius moribus it is not vnlike his custome but which is more to be obserued it must either come from iulian himselfe or the coniurer who was then alone with him at his coniurations or else it must haue been deuised by some man that could not see it now iudge you what credit is to be giuen to such report yet we denie not but this might be the lord to iulians further iust condemnation shewing his mightie power when hee was called vpon by him in so great an extremitie s chrysostom most largely discourseth of the glorious vse of the crosse ora quod christus sit deus see the place among an hundred other commendations of it he hath these words that the heads of kings are not so decked with their diademes as with the signe of the crosse and concludeth that all man striue to passe other in taking to them this admirable crosse and that no man was ashamed of it but esteemed themselues more beautified with that than with many iewels borders and chaynes garnished with pearle and pretious stones there is no doubt but a true christian thinkes himselfe more honoured by the profession of his faith in christ than by any or all the ornaments in the world while it was needfull to make shew of that profession by such meanes we condemne not the vse of it now that occasion amongst christians in these parts is ceased and the thing growne to monstrous superstition wee make no question but that if they liued now and saw the abuse of that custom of theirs they would both refraine and abolish it if it lay in them it is not their vsing of that sigue in such sort as i haue shewed but your idolatrous abusing of it and discrediting of it and them which we mislike neither is it at all against reason or custom of the church that such outward actions as some speciall occasion bred should with that occasion die and cease h quantum mutamur ab ipsis alasse what a pittifull change is this that that which was of the best christians reputed deere and holy should now be accounted a point of superstition and plaine witchcraft but what is all this adoe about the crosse to the credit of images seeing as i noted afore there is nothing affirmed in the testimonies you bring but that the signe of the crosse was vsed either to testifie the profession of christianitie or as an outward gesture in calling vpon the name of our sauiour christ by all which we learne that the best christians both vsed alwaies and highly esteemed of holy images euen from our sauiours owne daies and god himselfe hath by diuine testimony of miracles recommended them vnto vs not only for the ciuill and historicall vses of them but more to honor them whose pictures they were for no man in his right wits can deny but that it is and hath alwaies bin reputed as a great honor done to the deceased to erect him an image to eternise the memorie of his noble acts as also that it is a great encouragement to all beholders of such pourtraits to endeuour to in tate their glorious examples the very sight of the image of polemon a most chast and holy personage moued an vnchast woman to change her life as out of s gregorie nazianzen is related hauing so great testimony for the auncient vse of images and such manifold commodity by the discreet and holy practise of them he must needs be furiously transported with blind zeale that makes war against crosses and burnes holy pictures as of late the superintendent of hereford did in the market place openly here is not one sufficient testimonie as i haue shewed to prooue that euer there were any such images as you speake of then what miracles could be wrought for the countenancing of our sauiour by them it is an honour indeed to haue images erected in memorie of the deceased but not for him that is god neither is it a religious honour but a ciuill proceeding not from our deuotion but from our loue whatsoeuer the ground of our loue be in respect of them whom we so honour how slight and vaine a motion to the imitation of any mans vertues the sight of his image is let all experience testifie which indeed can bring no more but the remembrance of it at the most but suppose there were some more force in it all the helps that can be imagined likely to come by it will not counteruaile the danger of idolatry and so the breach of god commandement in erecting them for any vse of religion whereupon idolatry will most certainly ensue that fable of i cannot tell what a man saith charlemaigne out of the colicill lib c pag woman moued to some ciuill outward carriage by the beholding of polemons image seemes to haue been deuised out of the heathen historie of another polemon who was brought to the like ciuill vertue by hearing the philosopher xenocrates discourse of continencie and temperancie a farre more likely matter whether it be true or false but what haue we to doe with that lying conuenticle which tels vs of such a thing out of athanasius as was written if they say true some foure hundred yeeres before and neuer heard of vntill that time when there was such speciall need of it no no that dealing of that councill is too well knowne to purchase any credit with me that will not wilfully be blinded in the like sort they deale with basil cyril ambrose chrysostom gregorie and the apostles themselues whose decrees they fetch out of a counterfeit synod at antioch our dissent from them touching images stands in three points i the church of rome holds it lawful for them to make images to resemble god though not in respect of his diuine nature yet in respect of some properties and actions wee on the contrarie hold it unlawful for vs to make any image any way to represent the true god or to make an image of any thing in way of religion to worship god much lesse the creature thereby for the second commandement saith plainely exod thou shalt not make to thy selfe any grauen image or the likenesse of any thing in heauen ampc the papists say the commaundement is meant of the images of false god but will they nill they it must be vnderstood of the images of the true iehouah and it forbids vs so saith the romane catech com to resemble god either in his nature properties or works or to vse any resemblance of him for any sacred vse as to help the memorie when we are about to worship god thus much the holy ghost who is the best expouder of himself teacheth most plainly deut thou sawest no image at al either of false or true god and therefore thou shalt not make any likenes of anything and againe the prophet esay c reprouing idolaters asketh to whom they will liken god or what similitude will they set vp to him and verse know ye nothing haue ye not heard hath it not bin told you from the beginning as if he should say haue yee forgotten the second commaundement that god gaue vnto your fathers and thus he flatly reprooues all them that resemble the true god in images this passeth all kind of impudencie to quote the roman catechisme in defence of that opinion which it doth of set purpose disproue it teacheth indeed that the very nature and substance of god which is wholy spirituall cannot be expressed and figured by corporall lineaments and colours and all edgeth the places produced by m perkins to proue that unlawful yet by and by annexeth these words let no man therefore thinke it to be against religion and the law of god vvhen any person of the most holy trinities is pourtraied in such sort as they haue appeared either in the old or nevv testament ampc but let the pastor teach that not the nature of god but certaine properties and actions appertaining to god are represented in such pictures if the man be not past grace he wil surely blush at such a foule error his textes of scripture are taken out of the same place of the catechisme and do proue only that god proper nature cannot nor may not be resembled in any corporall shape or liknes if you would haue dealt as kindly with master perkins in this quotation as i haue dealt with you in many you might haue applied it to the former part that the commandement is meant of the images of the true iehouah which your catechisme grants though onely so farre as concernes the expressing of his forme by an image as your selfe also confesse and the concil trid sell de councill of trent affirmes that to be vn being al one in the coueting of wife and coueting of house servant maide oxe asse and whatsoeuer els as the rom apostle expresseth it without metioning any particular but the two first differ almost as much as may be the first forbidding the worship of any other god but the true the second prohibiting the worshipping of him by an image or idoll the last reason which only your catechisme brings beside austins authoritie and custome of your church is insufficient also for it was very fit that god should adde that reason of promise and threatning to that rather than any of the rest because hee had speciall care of that and knew that the iewes and all man generally were likely to worship him after their owne deuices and namely by images beside is not the reason annexed to the third commandement as generall that god will not hold him guiltlesse which breakes any of his lawes why then doe you not make that also a part of the first commandement and the distinction they make that an image is the representation of true things an idol of things supposed is false but master perkins goeth on and saith that our distinction betweene image and idoll that an image representeth a thing that is but idoll a thing supposed to be but is not is false and against the auncient writers vvho make it all one we proue the contrary first by the authority of the auncient doctors origin and theodoret vvho in expresse vvords deliuer the same difference of image and idoll vvhich is taken out of s paul laying that an idoll is nothing in the vvorld that is such idols as the heathen take for their god are nothing formally that is though they be great peeces of wood or stone materially yet they represent a thing that is not that is such a thing to be a god which is nothing lesse let m perkins but quote one place in the whole bible where they are vsed both for one i will cite some where if you vse the one for the other you must offend all good christia eares as where ma is said to be made after the image of god may you say after the idoll of god christ is said to be the image of his father will you call him the idoll of his father surely he cannot deny but the seuenth general councel holden about yeres past and gone is so farre off from making image and idoll al one that it doth accurse al them who call the image of christ and his saints idols master perkins saith no more but that it is false without adding that it is against the ancient writers and yet hee might haue said so well enough for all origin and theodoret for they two are but a few of many and by their other writings ouerthrow that distinction between image and idoll to make the case plaine we must vnderstand that they call an image the resemblance of any thing that hath a being in nature for example if you carue graue paint or cast the forme of a man horse tree plant fowle fish sun moon star or any such like thing you make an image but if you make a monster as a man halfe flesh half fish like our mairmaides or a beast compounded of diverse parts of sundrie creatures for example the head of a man the bodie of a horse the feete of a lion ampc or in a word as the common opinion is of gryphins which are said to haue the forepart like an eagle and the hinder part like a lion that is an idol because in truth there is no such creature in the world by this it is manifest that no shape of a man by their doctrine can be an idoll for that shape hath some thing like it in nature yet origin lib in cap ad rom origin doubts not with the apostle to condemne them of idolatry who worshipped god in the likenes of an image of a corruptible man of fowles fourefooted beast and creeping things so doth theodor de de curan graec affect ser de dijs amp angel theodoret where hee disputes against the gentiles out of that same place of the apostle reciting his words who calles those idols of the gentiles likenesses of the image of a corruptible man theodoret grounds his interpretation vpon the words of the commandement mistaken but he meddles not so much as by any signification with that place of the apostle indeede origin hath it but not in your sense as appeareth by your exposition which agrees not with origin nor theodoret about the difference between an image and an idoll for you comming neerer to the corinthian apostles meaning expound that nothing to signifie no god or diuine power as if the error were in making that a god which is nothing lesse but they vpon whom you would build your distinction make an idoll such a shape as hath no substance answering to it in nature and therefore they denie that the image of a man is an idoll though it be worshipped as i shewed before you make it an idoll be it of what shape it will if it represent such a thing to be god as is nothing lesse he makes an idoll saith origin who according to the apostle that saith an idoll is nothing makes that which is not marke you what origin saith that which is not you say that which is not god but he proceedes what is that saith he which is not a shape which the eye hath not seene but the mind faines to it selfe for example if a man be made with a dogs head ampc and theodoret propounds for example of an idoll sphinx the monster hvginus fab c which had a maids face a birds wing and a dogs body and the tritons or sea god halfe man halfe fish and the centaures halfe man halfe horse so that the only authors you can bring of that distinction make nothing at all for it as you vnderstand it yes they make against it calling that an image which you terme an idoll namely the statue of iupiter mars venus and the rest of the heathen idols who both had the shapes of man or woman and that such man and woman as had a true being in nature though they were no god besides origin the first founder of that distinction brings it but doubtfully with opinor i thinke though theodoret yeres after came to affirme it without doubting but what skils it whether there be such a distinction or no between the greeke words seeing the exod hebrew wherein the commaundement was written will not admit any such difference and both origin and theodoret hold images forbidden by the commaundement as well as idols and your vulgar translation followes not the greeke but the sculp le hebrew yes the greeke translators deut amp amp iud amp otherwhere and that often for the same hebrew word giue the generall greeke word that expresseth it very fully and sometimes the very word image but i must handle this point more largely then i thought because you challenge vs to bring one place in the whole bible where they are vsed both for one which i shew thus the word which in the commaundement they translate idoll in isay another place they interpret image he seekes a cunning workeman to prepare an image and in the verse the workeman melteth an image besides the word image is often put for the idols of the heathen regina then the people of the land destroyed the house of baall with his alters and his images ezech amp they made images of their abhominations thou madest thy selfe images of man when she saw man painted vpon the wall the images of the chaldeans that is the idols o the chaldeans attired after the fashion of the people of that countrey lastly that word which the chal e paraphrast vseth in the commaundement and so generally where the word of the commandement is in the hebrew the greeke doth commonly translate image as you may see in the places last recited i thinke it is very hard to find any two words that agree in all significations both proper and tropicall neither do we say that idoll may be vsed wheresoeuer image may for custome is the rule of speech but we denie both that distinction which origin deuised and that which you would haue past for currant as if idoll did signifie some certaine kind of shape and not generally any forme as the word image doth tertullian de idol c saith that euery forme or representation is to be tearmed an idol but tertullian saith m perkins affirmeth them to be all one not so neither for he maketh idolum a diminuture of dos which signifieth a forme or similitude so that jdolon is but a small similitude or slender image not so much for the quantitie as for that it representeth but darkely master perkins doth not say so of tertullian that he affirmes them to be all one but that tertullian saith euery forme or representation is to be tearmed an idoll saith tertull de idolola tertullian in greeke signifies formam a forme or shape from thence by deriuation is framed and hath in like sort with vs made the word formulam therefore omnis for formula euery shape great or little must be called an idoll thence comes idolatry which is any seruice about any idoll iudge your selfe now whether master perkins did not report tertullians opinion truly and whether you do not wrong him by making him say that he neuer meant so do you tertullian himselfe in giuing a false reason of the word not intended by him and howsoeuer the word may in deriuation be a diminutiue yet in vse it is not so but signifieth any shape great or little representing a thing perfectly or imperfectly as the word doth and isidore etym lib saith that the heathen vsed the names of image and idol indifferently in one and the same signification eustathius and excellent greeke interpreter vpon the eleauenth book of homers odyssea describeth idolum to signifie a vaine and vanishing image as the shadow of a man a ghost or phantastical imagination and so it cannot be that al profane authors vse these two words indifferetly seeing both in proper signification and by the declaration of the learned there is great difference betweene them eustath in hormer odyss eustathius doth not vndertake to deliuer in that place the proper nature of the word but to shew what homer there meanes by it namely that he vseth it to signifie the ghosts or shapes of man departed fashioned of ayre or imprinted in the ayre by a certaine shadow or slight resemblance where the very word comming from image is put to expresse the likenes the same word idoll homer vseth homer iliad lib otherwhere to signifie the shape or likenes which apollo made of aeneas to saue him from diomedes both these kinds of idols virgil who vnderstood homer well enough and knew the nature and vse of greeke and latine words calls images for the former viz the shapes of the deceased thus he speakes of aeneas wife creusa virgil aeneid lib infoelix simulachrum atque ipsius vmbra cresae visa mihi ante oculos amp nota major image where hauing termed creusas ghost first a likenes and then a shadow last of all he calls it an image and presently after comparing it to the wind and to a sleepe or a dreame he giues it the name of image againe ter frustra comprensa manus effugit image par leuibus ventis volucrique simillima somno so he speakes of virgil aeneid anchises ghost vsing the very same verses and in the lib fourth booke turbida tenet imago so againe of him tua tristis imago and of adrastus lib adrasti pallentis imago yes the apparitions of the centaures and sea monsters which by origens distinction are idols virgil calls lib tenues sine corpore vitas and saith that they flye vp and down caua sub imagine formae the other shapes made of aire or some such thin stuffe he describes by the same word image as in that fiction of aeneas shape made by iuno to draw turnus out of the battaile which he cais lib tenuem sine viribus vmbram and compareth it to the ghosts of the deceased and to apparitions in dreames this he calls an image at primas laeta ante acies exultat imago which homer would haue termed whom would you refute by this isidor etymol lib isidore is the author master perkins the reporter only but you strike at adventure not respecting where the blow light but where you meane to hit yet you should haue said no more then they do that the heathen vse the names indifferently not that all prophane authors do so and you should haue vnderstood them aright too as i shewed before not that both words are vsed in all significations in which either is but that they are vsed indifferently for any kind of shape whether it haue something or nothing answering to it in any true naturall being and s steuen in his apologie act calls the golden calfe an idol but s stephen cals the golden calfe an idoll so it was indeed what is that to the purpose do you aske what it is to the purpose that act s stephen cals the golden calfe an idoll it directly ouerthrowes the distinction against which master perkins disputes for a calfe is a thing that hath a reall being in nature and is not an imagination of the braine as sphinx and triton and such like are according to the authors you alleage in this case hierome in isai saith that idols are images of dead man and s ierom saith that idols are the images of dead man adde that are taken for god true many idols be images all such as truly represent any person that was once liuing here but no images be idols vnlesse it be taken for a god and so idols requires besides the image that it be made a god or the image of a false god if we adde your glosse we shall adde nothing in defence barbarous nation scythians numidians seres and persians he answers that they agree indeed in the matter refusing to build or vse any altars and images but that the reasons of their opinions are diverse they following i know not what fansies the christians refraining these things in obedience to god commandements namely the first and second which hee there recites therefore origin holds it forbidden in those commandements to make or vse any image in the seruice of god to this doctrine of origin the practise of the primitiue church is agreeable that i may please you with more testimonies we are slatly forbidden saith clemens alexa in ad ge s clement of alexandria to vse that deceitfull craft or article for the prophet saith thou shalt not make the likenes of any thing in heauen or earth below and againe we haue no materiall image but such an image as is perceiued by the vnderstanding god who only is the true god is conceiued by vnderstanding not by sense clemens stromat lib in another place moses many ages agoe made a direct law that wee should not make any grauen cast or painted image that we might not sed sensible things but might passe to the consideration of those things which are perceiued by the vnderstanding and further ibid the daily fight or beholding of an image causeth the maiestie of god to become vile and contemptible and to worship by a materiall thing that which is conceiued by the vnderstanding is to make it vile by sense god saith tertul de idololatr c tertullian forbids as well the making as the worshipping of an idoll and afterward for this cause namely to roote out the matter of idolatry the law of god proclaimes make no idoll and adding nor likenes of any thing in heauen in earth or in the sea forbids the servant of god all ouer the world to vse that craft in tetul de coron militis cap another place john saith babes keepe your selues from idols he saith not now from idolatry as from the seruice of them but from idols that is from the shape of them for it is an vnworthie thing that

giraldus that we christians as sometimes also the romanes had no images in the primitiue church optatus an ancient bishop of africa counted it a defiling of the altar to haue an image set vpon it and optat lib pen in extremo saith that when it was reported that paul and macarius would come and place an image on the altar they that heard it were astonied at it and accounted it as execrable to partake with it images saith august in psalm austin are of more force to corrupt the miserable soule because they haue a mouth eyes eares nosthrils hands and feete than to instruct it because they speake not heare not smell not handle not walke not out of which place of austin cassander in consul ad masimil imperat de imag cap cassander concludes that there was no vse of images in churches in austins time the reason is alike wheresoeuer they be vsed to religion the reasons which they vse to defend their opinions are these i in salomons temple were erected cherubines which were images of angels on the mercieseat where god was worshipped and thereby was resembled the maiestie of god therefore it is lawful to make images to resemble god answer they were erected by special commandement from god who prescribed the verie forme of them and the place where they must be set and thereby moses had a warrant to make them otherwise hee had sinned let them shew the like warrant for their images if they can secondly the cherubins were placed in the holie of holies in the most inwarde place of the temple and consequently were remoued from the sight of the people who onely hearde of them and none but the high priest saw them and that but once a yeere and the cherubins without the vaile though they were to be seen yet were they not to be worshipped exod therefore they serue nothing at all to iustifie the images of the church of rome obiect ii god appeared in the forme of a man to abraham gen and to daniel who sawe the ancient of daies sitting on a throne daniel now as god appeared so may he be resembled therefore say they it is lawful to resemble god in the forme of a man or any like image in which he shewed himselfe to man answer in this reason the proposition is false for god may appeare in whatsoeuer forme it pleaseth his maiestie yet doth it not follow that man should therefore resemble god in those formes man hauing no libertie to resemble him in any forme at all vnlesse he bee commaunded so to doe againe when god appeared in the forme of a man that forme was a signe of god presence onely for the time when god appeared and no longer as the bread and wine in the sacrament are signes of christs bodie and blood not for euer but for the time of administration for afterward they become againe as common bread and wine and when the holy ghost appeared in the likenesse of a doue that likenesse was a signe of his presence no longer then the holy ghost so appeared and therefore hee that would in these formes represent the trinitie doth greately dishonour god and doe that for which hee hath no warrant hauing confuted the protestant arguments against the making of images to represent some property or action of god i now come vnto the catholike proofe of them the first reason set dovvne by m perkins i reserue to the next point the second is god appeared in the forme of a man to abraham and to daniel vvho savv the auncient of daies sitting on a throne now as god hath appeared so may he bee purtraied and dravvne m perkins his ansvvere is not so vnlesse it be expressel commanded by god reply this first is flat against his ovvne second conclusion where he holdeth it lawful to present to the eye in pictures any history of the bible in priuate pla es both the foresaid apparitions be in the old testament and therefore may be painted in priuate places which cannot be truly done without you do represent god in the same liknes as there he appeared and what reason leadeth in words to represent those actions of god the same serueth to expresse them in liuely colours not so saith m perkins because when god appeared in the forme of man it was a signe of god presence for that time only and for no longer be it so it might notwithstanding be recorded in writing that the memory of such maiestie ioyned with louing kindnesse might endure longer and if it pleased god that this short presence of his should be written to be perpetually remembred euen so the same might be ingrauen in brasle to recommend it to vs so much the more effectually for as the famous poet doth by the light of nature sing it is your aduantage that master perkins is not aliue to answere you who was better able to expresse his own meaning than any otherman can be but in my opinion it was his purpose in that second conclusion to graunt the pourtraying of those history onely which had nothing to bee painted that was forbidden as he alwaies tooke the resembling of god to be that was generall as rules of grammar are exceptions are not contradictions but rather parts of those rules if you speake of that reason which moued god to inspire moses for the writing of that storie we grant that hee might to the same end haue also enioyned the painting or engrauing of it but since it pleased him not so to doe wee answere that your argument prooues nothing there is the same reason say you for painting that and such stories therefore they may as well be painted as written the consequence is false for the one was inspired as i said and the other not vpon the writing because it is god word wee may looke for a blessing from him not so vpon our owne deuices accompanied with danger of idolatry for my part sauing other mens better iudgement i perswade my selfe that god who commanded the israelites to write the words of the law about their houses and in other places for instruction and remembrance would haue enioyned the painting of his especiall miracles and workes in their fauour if he had not seene it to bee dangerous in respect of idolatry that might ensue for questionlesse a picture or an image is of great force chiefly if the word be added for exposition of it as we see in emblems and impresas but this helpe in the most wise iudgement of god was not thought so much worth that for it the danger of idolatry to which all man are so prone by nature should be aduentured therefore we must not be led in this case by the shew of humane reason but assure our selues it was not for nothing that god when he taught the iewes by signes and shadowes appointed not the vse of painting diuine history for instruction memorie or deuotion concerning horat de arte poetic ad pison horaces testimonie if you had seene as farre into the meaning of it as you imagine he did into the vse of pictures you would neuer haue alleaged it to such purpose as now you doe for you might easily haue perceiued that the poet grounds not his precept vpon any light of nature but vpon experience of mens affections and which is the principall thing that he speakes not at all of any dumbe pictures but of the liuely gestures of players vpon the stage some things saith he are acted on the stage some are onely reported there and supposed to be done in some other place now between these is this comparison made that those things doe more affect which we see done than those that we onely heare reported what is this to pictures your poetrie failes you as well as your diuinitie this argument may be confirmed by the pictures of angels of vertues and other such like of spirituall or accidentall nature for if such things as haue no bodily proportion or shape may notwithstanding be counterfeit and resembled in some qualities why may not some propertie or action of god be in like manner represented but some qualities of angels say you which are spirituall substances and the qualities of angels and man which we call vertues and which by your leaue haue as true a being as other creatures though they neuer be of themselues but adioyned to some spirituall subiect may be counterfeited and resembled therefore why may not some propertie or action of god be in like manner reputed first i thinke you are hardly able to prooue your antecedent that such things may be resembled in outward formes for god seruice secondly though that be graunted yet your consequence is naught for there is a commaundement of god against the later as we heard out of clement least his maiesty should by such resemblances grow into contempt to which i adde least idolatry should ensue vpon it that thou mayest reader vnderstand the better what we meanee obserue that pictures represent after three sorts some expresse to the quicke the very shape proportion and colour of the patterne as the liuely picture of man or of any such corporall thing others represent things as they did appeare and were acted as if the painter should expresse the meeting of god with abraham and his entertainement he must then resemble god in the same likenes of a man in which he shewed himselfe to abraham thirdly an image of a spirituall thing may be dravvne not to resemble the nature of it but to lead our vnderstanding by such a similitude into some better knovvledge of that thing so are angels painted like goodly young man vvith vvings to teach vs that they be of an excellent pure nature euer flourishing and most ready to dispatch vvith all expedition any imployment to vvhich god sends them and so may god the father be pourtraied as a goodly old graue man sitting in his throne of maiestie attended vpon by millions of angels as he is described in daniel to instruct vs how he is eternall insinit wise and of most redoubtable maiestie in either of these two latter sorts we hold that god may be represented and so in the seauenth generall councell the drawing of the holy ghost in forme of a doue as he appeared mat is approued your discourse of the diverse representations intended by pictures i passe ouer as nothing to purpose for the reason of our denying images is not only because god can not be resembled as being a spirit and infinit but principally because he himselfe hath forbidden it as a certaine occasion of idolatry this painting of angels like faire yong man with wings of deniall from the tabernacle built by moses wherein you will not remember that the patterne shewed to moses was a direction for salomon and a warrant in all things that were agreeable to moses worke but master perkins might haue had enough to say though he had answered directly viz that salomon was a prophet and had also direction for his building from the kingly prophet dauid his father and therfore it doth not follow that because salomon made such cherubins euery man that builds any church may set vp the like or to speake indeede directly according to his consequent it is not lawful for vs to make images to resemble god because salomon adorned the temple with cherubins moses indeed had an expresse precept for the making of them as he had for the curteines and curteine rods and euery particular belonging to the tabernacle but salomon vvithout any speciall commaundement out of his high and holy vvisdome vnderstood that he might most lavvfully and laudably imitate that heauenly patterne of moses and as the building vvas farre more sumptuous and stately so in the number and quantity of pictures exceeded which is a sufficient instruction and vvarrant for all man after his daies to make and set images in the church and this finally m perkins seemes to graunt vvhen he saith that these cherubs vvithout the veile were there to be seene but not to be vvorshipped so that vve haue gotten one step further that images may not only be made but also set vp in the churches now to your enthymem in salomons temple there were cherubins within the holy of holyes and without vpon the walls and dores therefore all holy pictures may be placed in churches first concerning your antecedent it must be remembred that those cherubins were not in the vtter court where the people vsed to come and pray but in the holy place where the altar of incense stood and where luke leuit none came but the priests and in the holie of holies into exod leuit heb which the high priest only might enter and that but once a yeare where the ark was so that these images were remoued out of the peoples sight and that by salomons propheticall wisdome secondly there was no vse of these images to any purpose of religion but they serued only for ornament and state as the other worke of the temple did except the two cherubins vpon the mercy seate ere i answere to your consequence i may not forget to note that in your cosequent or conclusion you call images holy as if by i know not what holynes they had some right to be placed in churches as also you speake afterward where should holy pictures of holy man be more properly bestowed then in holy places nothing is to be counted holy but that which either hath a qualitie of holines in it as all that are sanctified haue or else is belonging to the seruice of god and whatsoeuer is of this later kind is rather hallowed then holy and hath no holines in it but by being consecrated to such a vse neither is this consecration as that of the ceremoniall lawe was whereby a thing was made indeed holy ceremonially as nothing with vs can be the ceremonies being abrogated so that such things are no longer nor farther holy then they are employed in that seruice and therefore the water with which we baptise and the bread and wine with which we celebrate the supper of the lord after those actions are past are no more holy then any other matter bread or wine images therefore can no way be holy more then any other worke in churches therfore setting apart this bare title of holines i denie the consequence of your enthymem salomon adorned the inner parts of the temple where the people came not with pictures of cherubins therefore it is lawful to set vp images in churches where the people ordinarily come who seeth not great difference betweene the antecedent and the consequent to omit that which i answered before on master perkins behalfe concerning salomons warrant for his so doing his father and himselfe being prophets which is fortified by the testimony of tertullian in the place cited before where he saith that our sauiour was pictured vpon holy chalices which were vsed at the altars and of sozomenus vvho vvitnesseth that our sauiours picture vvas taken into the church the authoritie of other mens doings is of lesse waight tertullian saith christ was pictured like a shepheard vpon the chalices nazianzen trimmed vp images basil allowed of the martyr barlaams picture in the churches damasus saith constantine set vp a siluer image of our sauiour chrysostom and austin say that the crosse was on the holy tables therefore it is lawful to set vp images in churches of the antecedent by and by in the meane while i deny the consequence they allow of images therefore they are lawful if your church thinke it possible for these man to erre as i am sure it doth then may it not be take for lawful because they approue it but to the antecedent what doth tertull de pudicit lib tertullian but tell vs what the chalice maker had done in likelyhood for the setting forth of his worke both this and that of sozom history lib cap sozomens report is answered before it is not proued there euer was any such image of our sauiour s gregorie nazianzen maketh mention of images in the church of neocaesarea trimmed vp by himselfe saint basil pointeth to that holy mans picture standing in the church nazianzen epistle ad olympium nazianzen and basil orat in barlaam martyr basil speake not of images to any vse of religion whereof only our question is but either for ornament as the former saith nazianzen omne nostrum in eo exornando studium all our labour and care in the beautifying of it or for honor to the martyr which was ciuill not religious and yet scarce iustifiable damasus in vita silu shevveth hovv constantine in the church of s john lateran erected a siluer image vnto our sauiour s chrysostom demonst quod christ sit deus and s augustine sermon de sanct do teach that the crosse was on the holy tables and vsed at all holy functions this da us in vita syluestri report of constantines erecting a siluer image seemeth to depend vpon the tale of his being baptised at rome by syluester whereas it is apparant by euseb le vita const lib cap eusebius and theodoret history ecclesiastes lib cap theodoret that he was not baptised till the very end of his life and in asia many hundred miles from that church of saint john lateran in rome in nicomedia now called by the turke who possesseth it nichor a towne of bythinia chrysost in demonst qud christus sit deus chrysostom speaketh of the generall vse of the crosse in all places not for any holines of the signe but as a marke of profession the crosse saith he is in the purple robes in the crownes the crosse is at our prayers the crosse is in our armor the crosse is vpon the holy table the crosse is ouer all the world yes the crosse glisters aboue the sun if this crosse were an image optat lib optatus as we heard before counts the presence of it a defiling of the altar that place of aug ser de sanct if it be augustines austin intreates of the crosse both for the signe and image of it most superstitiously ascribing strange effects to it which no moderate or reasonable man can defend except he will expound it as i shewed before of an outward ceremonie vsed in prayer to which purpose wee may applie that speech of his in the end of that discourse looke what the presence of christs body did vpon the earth that doth the famous memory of the victorious crosse with a faithfull calling vpon the name of christ otherwise it is wonderfull strange that austin should so highly esteeme of the crosse whereas optatus a worthie bishop of the same countrey in anno the beginning of austins time accounts so meanely of it and the reason why images should principally be set in churches is very pregnant for where should holy pictures of holy man be more properly bestovved than in holy places and the church being a resemblance of heauen as s paul teacheth is most conueniently decked vp vvith images the representations of heauenly creatures that man entring into that holy place may by the vievv and consideration of such a heauenly shew retire their minds from worldly busines and lift them vp vnto the soueraigne monarch of both heauen and earth the hebr apostle saith no such thing of any church now but affirmes that the tabernacle of the iewes was ceremonially a shadow of heauenly things and yet it would be remembred that the tabernacle and temple had no images but in the holie places where the people came not we hold it very conuenient to haue our churches modestly adorned rather than sumptuously and with such kinde of ornaments as may not carrie away the minde by the outward sense either to a vaine imagination or to some superstitious conceit now let vs come to those tvvo obiectione of m perkins vvhich see me to be against the erection of images in churches the first is out of the councell of eliberis cap which commandeth that nothing should be painted on the walles of the church that was adored of the people ans that if the councell speake of the image of god in vvhich sense m perkins citeth it and the word adored doth insinuate then it may be said that the councill inhibiteth that sort of god images vvhich are made to expresse the diuine nature if it be extended vnto all sorts of images i answere that they were then forbidden to be drawen vpon the church vvalles but not to be set in tables vpon the altar or in any other place the reason is because that councell vvas holden in time of persecution as appeareth by the twenty fiue canon of it and then if the persecutor had found out the place of their assembly as they often did those pictures must needs either haue been defaced by themselues or left vnto the derision and despight of the heathen and pictures also painted vpon such poore walles as they had then to their churches vvould either by the moysture of the vvalles or other incommoditie haue bin quickly disfigured wherefore to the greater honor of such sacred things those graue fathers thought it not meete to haue them dravven vpon the church vvalles there being many more meete places for them in the churches you concil eliber cap come backe now to those two allegations which should and might haue been answered as fitly in their due place your first answere hath no shew of reason in it for it is absurd to imagine that any christians to whom onely the councill speakes would thinke the diuine nature which is spirituall and infinite could be exprest by any picture but if it be possible for the people to be so blind yet the bishops and ministers who had the charge of such places must needs know it to bee unlawful and vnpossible besides if they meant to forbid such images onely why doe they not call them idols after your distinction why doe not they expresse their meaning more plainly but speake so dangerously to make all images thought unlawful as the word adored was in your opinion a warrant for master perkins to applie that canon to the images of god so by the same reason is the other word worshipped which the councill hath a sufficient authoritie to stretch the decree to all images that may bee worshipped your coniectures are meere shifts refuted by the very words of the councill it is decreed saith the councill that there may be no images in the church what will become then of your images vpon altars vnlesse you will remoue your altars out of the church that which followeth doth not respect the walles more than any other part of the church but names them specially vpon which images most commonly were painted but what a toy is it that you talke of persecutors finding out the place of their assemblie when they could hold a councill and had churches to repaire to could their churches be vnknowne further if their care had bin to prouide that the moysture of the walles might not disfigure the images they would haue said plainly we will haue no images on church walles least that which is adored and worshipped come to some disgrace and this would also haue included the other reason of the persecutors despight but it is manifest that the meaning of the decree is this that they will not suffer any images in churches because that which is worshipped and adored may not bee resembled by pictures the decree indeede speakes onely of the images of god to whom only religious adoration and worship is due and may lawfully be performed the second obiection is out of a post script of epiphanius letter vnto john patriarke of ierusalem in which is written as m perkins falsely reporteth that it is against the authority of scripture to see the pictures of christ or of any saint to hang in the church ans it is there only to see the picture of a man novv that he should meane of christ or of some saint is only gathered yet m perkins makes no bones to thrust them both into the text euen so do we thinke that some old enemy of images added that post script vnto epiphanius letter our reasons are because it hath no coherence with the former letter or st e againe in the seauenth councell when all that could be found out of antiquity vvas cited against images no tidings there of this place which if it had bin true might haue bin one of the principall thirdlie in the same councell other tvvo places brought as it were out of epiphanius vvorkes vvere found to be none of his and for images vvas alleadged that epiphanius ovvne disciples erected an image to their master and set it in the church vvhich they would neuer haue done if he had taught them to be against the scripture so to doe master perkins doth not vndertake to report epiphanius words but his matter which hee performes truly i found saith epiphan ad an osol epiphanius speaking of a church at anablatha in his trauell to bethel in the church doore a vaile hanging stained and painted and hauing the image as it were of christ or some saint for i remember not well whose image it was when i saw this that against the authoritie of the scripture the image of a man hung in the church of christ i rent it these are epiphanius words whereout i obserue first that it is against the authoritie of the scripture and therfore against god commandement that the image of a man should hang in christs church but the images of al your saints are such amp those of the trinitie too except that doue for the holie ghost secondly i adde that it is rightly gathered by necessarie consequence which is as good euery whit as plaine words that it is against scripture to haue the picture of christ or any saint in the church for he saith expresly that the image he saw was the image of christ or some saint and that it was unlawful to haue any image of a man there there is no reason to call it a post script vnlesse euerie last point of any letter not depending vpon the former be a post script hieronym n illa epistle hierome that translated the epistle out of greeke into latin found no such diuersitie of stile in it neither indeed is it to be found and this latter part is brought in according to the course of writing in the former epiphanius cleeres himselfe to john bishop of ierusalem for hauing ordered a deacon in his diocesse he begins his excuse thus i haue heard ampc in the latter part he defends himselfe concerning the renting of the vaile and begins that also in the like sort i haue heard this was written and translated three hundred yeeres before that idolatrous councill though perhaps they thought it no wisedome to take knowledge of it the other places brought in that councill were for images and so allowed of by that councill and haue since been discerned to be counterfeit as that is of his disciples no thankes to that counterfeit synod which dealeth in the same sort also with basil you afterward alleage the place for images with cyrill ambrose athanasius chrysostom gregorie and the apostles themselues as i shewed before m perkins obserues a special reason in epiphanius other counterfeit testimony that images must not be suffered in the common house because vve must carry god in our minds to vvhich vve ansvvere that images must be suffred in all places that vve may the better carry god in our harts being by the sight of them both often put in mind of him and much moued to honor and loue him in steed of answering the other testimonie out of epiphanius you go about vnder hand to strike at him thorough master perkins sides but there is no great force in your blow for as i said erewhile there is more daunger of idolatry in the suffering of images especially in any place where god is to bee worshipped than hope of instruction or deuotion by the sight of them and as epiphan cont encratit citat in concil constantinople epiphanius saith in this place it is not meete that a christian should be exercised by the eyes but by the meditation of the minde for such sight as clemens strom lib clement taught vs before abaseth the maiestie of god and begets in vs erroneous opinions obiect iii man is the image of god but it is lawful to paint a man and therefore to make the image of god ans a very cauill for first a man cannot be painted as he is the image of god which stands in the spiritual gifts of righteousnesse and true holinesse againe the image of a man may be painted for ciuill or historicall vse but to paint any man for this ende to represent god or in the way of religion that wee may the better remember and worship god it is unlawful other reasons which they vse are of small moment and therefore i omit them differ ii they teach and maintaine that images of god and of saints my be worshipped with religious worship specially the crucifixe for summ part quaest article thomas of watering saith seeing the crosse doth represent christ who died vpon a crosse and is to bee worshipped with diuine honour it followeth that the crosse is to be worshipped so too we on the contrary hold they may not our principall ground is the second commaundement which containeth two partes the first forbiddeth the making of images to resemble the true god the second forbids the worshipping of them or god in them in these wordes thou shalt not bow downe to them now there can be no worship done to any thing lesse then the bending of the knee novv i come vnto a third point which m perkins maketh the second of our difference that images may be not only made and set in churches but also vvorshipped m perkins holds the contrarie and his principall ground is the second commandement vvhich containes saith he tvvo parts the first forbids the making of images to resemble god the second the vvorshipping of them or god in them in these vvords thou shalt not bovv dovvne to them ans if it be only forbidden to make the image of god and to adore it then the making and worshipping of the image of christ or of any other creature is not there prohibited and so this second commandement more than thrise alleadged vvill not serue the turne against any other image but god only and in plaine reason according also to master perkins his ovvne confession the commandements of the first table touch only our duty tovvards god that vve giue him all his due honor and do not giue any part therof vnto any thing else whatsoeuer wherfore diuine and godly worship is only there spoken of and not such worship as we giue vnto any creature or to the picture of it and consequently there is nothing there against the vvorshipping of our holy images it is not onely forbidden to make the image of god and to worship it but as master perkins said before to make an image of any thing in the way of religion to worship god much more to worship the creature thereby therefore the assumption that should be added to that proposition of yours if it be only forbidden ampc namely but it is only forbidden to make the image of god and to adore it is false and so the second commandement is against all images for god seruice the commandements of the first table touch onely our dutie to god true and it is an especial part of our dutie to him that we giue no religious honour to any thing whatsoeuer but to him onely for as religion is a dutie of the creature to the creator and not any bond between creature and creature so is religious honour due onely to him to whom religion is appropriated therefore the heathen were neuer so sottish as to worship any man or thing with religious worship whereto they did not first ascribe some kinde of diuinitie according to which they proportioned their worship thereto obserue that there is a soueraigne vvorshippe due to god as to the creator and gouernour of all the vvorld and to giue this to any creature is idolatry another honor by infinit degrees inferiour yet absolute in itself is ascribed vnto angels and man as creatures endued with reason and made after the likenesse of god and to exhibitth is to whom it is due is ciuilitie and not idolatry this honor may be diuided into two parts because these creatures are like to god asvvell in their naturall povvers and qualities as in their supernaturall and that honour vvhich is giuen to man or angell in respect of any naturall quality may be called morall or ciuil but that vvhich is attributed vnto them in regard of their supernaturall gifts may vvell be called religious and spirituall because it is due vnto them only for their spirituall and religious qualities there is a third kind of worship yet meaner then the other which is a kind of dependant and respectiue worship as vvhen a servant is honoured or cherished not for his ovvne but for his masters sake and this is that worship which vve allovv vnto images vvhich for the saints sake whom it doth represent vve do either reuerently regard or take off our hat or bovv our knee vnto it this third kind of worship being all we allow vnto pictures were he not that vnderstands it more than half franticke that should thinke it a great disparagement vnto the incomprehensible vvorship of god that to one of his servant pictures i should yeeld some such pettie reuerence or that god should forbid this in the fore front of his ten commaundements nothing lesse this discourse to colour your idolattie by a distinction of worship hath more craft than truth for first if you meane plainly why doe you not tell vs what that soueraigne worship is which you acknowledge due to the creator onely that we may consider whether you giue it to any creature or no secondly what is the meaning of those words that the honor ascribed to man and angels is absolute in it selfe and to what purpose is it here alleaged thirdly the chiefe reason of worshipping god is our dependance vpon him as d lib the heathen acknowledge and experience shewes in that ciuill worship we giue to princes amp magistrates and howsoeuer epicurus denying the prouidence of god and his gouerning of the world thought to auoide some blame in allowing worship to the god as you do in regard of their excellent and blessed nature yet neither was that accounted sufficient by the statesmen or learned and in truth it procures generally rather a reuerend opinion than any true worship lastly i pray you remember that the worship which afterward you diuide into ciuill and religious is here in the generall nature made ciuill yes euen that to angels that which the creatures lacke in waight it seemes you will make vp by number they may not haue say you the soueraigne worship due to god but to make the amends you allow them two kinds of worship ciuill in regard of their naturall resemblance of god and religious in respect of their supernaturall likenesse to him whereas god hauing nothing in him supernaturall must haue but one of the two only and that as it may seeme by proportioning the worship to creatures not ciuil but religious for why should god haue religious honor for those properties aboue all degrees and creatures for the same haue but ciuill in their degrees since in your iudgment they are capable of that honor also which is religious besides is this difference of honor in respect of the gifts or of the manner of giuing if the latter it is god who must then haue this diverse worship according to his diverse manner of working and not man in whom he workes so shall ciuill honor belong to god for the natural gifts he bestoweth vpon man if you regard the excellencie of the gifts why shuld they not be accounted of proportionably in the image which is man as they are in the substace and patterne which is god but in him those properties the resemblance wherof you call naturall in man are of as great excellencie as the other which in man you tearme supernaturall yes which is more though in god his nature and his properties be all one yet in man the naturall qualities are the more principall amp the other as it were but adiuncts therunto the natural parts of the soule that i may so speak are the vnderstanding and the wil all gifts and graces whatsoeuer are but qualities belonging to these two which are the verie substance of the soule further there is no reason why any religious worship should be performed to man by reason of these qualities because none was due to him before his fall when he had these else should adam haue bin worshipped by eue with religious worship and she by him for each of them had the image of god according to the nature of such creatures entire and perfect and if we beleeue your popish doctrine they had those qualities by an especiall grace of god aboue nature moreouer what reason can you giue why angels shuld not performe religious worship to the saints departed and both they and the same saints to those man liuing here on the earth who haue receiued those supernatural qualities from god for which religious worship is due to them on whom they are bestowed therfore this distinction of religious and ciuill worship is a meere deuise without any ground of true reason and all religious worship is due to god ciuill worshippe only belongs to man that respectiue worship is no other but ciuill as it may easily appeare because it may be and must be giuen euen to profane and reprobat man if any such be imployed by god in gouernment ouer vs for howsoeuer the outward manner of the honor we giue to princes and magistrates depends vpon the lawes and customes of the country wherin we liue yet the duty of honoring them lies vpon vs in conscience to be performed because they are god lieutenants and stewards this worship if you accounted it ciuill you might giue to whom you thought good and should not be condemned of vs for idolatry but for follie though you gaue it to images yet such follie as the gentiles are not guiltie of who neuer vsed such reuerence to the statues of any famous man but where first they had an opinion of some diuine nature i maruell how you could perswade your selfe to write so vntruly that the honor you giue to images is meaner then the former and that you would craftilie deceiue the ignorant as if taking off your hat and bowing your knee were al the honor you giue them why did you not then refute thomas whom m perkins brings in speaking thus thom q article seeing the crosse doth represent christ who died vpon the crosse and is to be worshipped with diuine honor it followeth that the crosse is to be worshipped so too did you neuer read that of bellarmine let this saith he bell mp be one preposition that the images of christ and the saints are to be worshipped not only by accident and vnproperly this is your dependent and respectiue worshippe which you say is all you allow vnto images but also properly so that the a o worship rest in the image not only as vt eem ge ex mp s it is insteed of the party whose image it is will you heare a third speake yet more plainly it is the constant opinion of diuines saith azorius inst lib cap azorius that the image is to be worshipped with the same worship and honor with which he is worshipped whose image it is belike you are no diuine or else you would acknowledge another manner of worship due to images let vs heare another iesuite the old schoole man saith gabr vasq de ador lib disp cap amp cap vasquez absolutly affirme that the images of christ are to be worshipped with diuine worship now for the particular worship concil trid elf de venerat the councell of trent as craftie and warie as it was saith more then you do that you fall downe before images and kisse them but who knoweth not that you performe all outward worship to them you perfume them with incense though they cannot smell you set vp lights before them though they cannot see and yet it is hard to say whether you or they be the blinder you kisse them you kneele downe to them you lye prostrate on the ground before them you pray sing and say your speciall seruices before them how could you do more outward worship to our sauiour iesus christ then you doe to these babies and puppets was it not more then need thinke you that the lord of heauen and earth should in the very heate of his iealousie make a law against such abhominations we may well see it was not for nothing that hee threatens so long a continuance of his heauie wrath vpon the breakers of the second commaundement againe the brasen serpent was a type or image of christ crucified ioh appointed by god himselfe yet when the people burned incense to it king hezekias brake it in pieces and is therefore commended and when the diuell bad our sauiour christ but to bow downe the knee vnto him and he would giue him the whole world christ reiects his offer saying thou shalt worship the lord thy god and him onely shalt thou serue matth againe it is lawful for one man to worship another with ciuill worship but to worship man with religious honor is unlawful for all religious worship is prescribed in the first table and the honour due to man is onely prescribed in the second table and the first commaundement therof honor thy father which honour is therefore ciuill and not religious now the meanest man that can bee is a more excellent image of god then all the images of god or of saints that are deuised by man but let vs go on vvith m perkins his argument his second is the brasen serpent was an image of christ crucified appointed by god yet vvhen the children of israell burned incense vnto it ezechias brake it in peeces ans so when christians generally giue godly honour to images as those israelits did to the serpent let them also be broken by their lavvfull superiour if no better remedie may be found but as that very brasen serpent duly vvorshipped many hundred yeeres by the same people before they fell to idolatry as witnesseth s augustine vvhere he reckoneth the brazen serpent among those signes vvhich are vvorthie of religious vvorship so good christians may worship all sorts of holy pictures so they thinke no god to dwell in them nor put any trust in the pictures but vse them only to stirre vp deuotion to keepe their minds from wandering after their domesticall affaires and to conserue the memory of god happy servant by godly honor english man vnderstand not that which is proper to god but that which is agreeable to the will of god if to burne incense to the brazen serpent were to giue it diuine honour your images are ordinarily worshipped with diuine honor besides ioh this brazen serpent was an image of christ crucified and therefore by your diuinitie might and ought to be worshipped with diuine honour as christ himselfe yet hezekiah brake it downe that is the magistrate it is pittie he lacked you to haue aduised him of some better remedie but aug de ciuit dei lib c augustine commends him for it as religiosa potestate deo e iens cum magna pieta tis laude contr t hauing in it done a speciall seruice to god with great commendation of piety but what speake i of augustine doth not the regina holy ghost reckon it amongst the actions of his vpright walking in the sight of god according to all that dauid his father had done doth he not ioyne it with taking away the high places breaking the images and cutting downe the groues actions precisely commaunded by god himselfe the brazen serpent was neuer worshipped by the people but idolatrously namely with incense burned to it vnto those daies saith the regina holy ghost speaking of hezechiahs time the children of israel did burne incense to it as for aug lib de trinit c augustine he giueth no suspition of any such thing all he saith is this that such things as god hath appointed to signifie some action of his person honorem habere possunt vt religiosa may haue honor as things vsed to religion what honor is this but a reuerend estimation according to the vse to which they are applied by the commaundement of god which may appeare because he ioynes with the brazen serpent sicut amp literae the writings that god ordeined to the like purpose viz the scriptures which are inded to be reuerently accounted of but cannot be worshipped without idolatry the common sort of papists do put as great trust in their idols as euer the heathen did in theirs doe you not teach them to pray to the crosse o crux aue spes vnica all haile our only hope to entreate of the crosse that it auge pijs iustitiam reisque dona veniam would encrease righteousnes in the godly and giue pardon to the guilty neither may it be shifted off with saying that this belongeth to christs passion and not to the crosse for thom q article thomas aquinas proueth by that hymne of the church that the very crosse is to be worshipped with diuine worship and hope of saluation to be placed in it thus he reasoneth we must giue diuine worship to that in which we place the hope of our saluation but we place the hope of our saluation in the crosse this assumption he proueth by the authority of that hymne whereupon he infers his conclusion therefore the crosse of christ is to be adored with diuine worship is not the chiefe vse of your images to please god and to do seruice to them whose images they are by worshipping of them did i not shew a little before out of bellarmine and other that the image must haue the honour due to the partie whose image it is yes that f the honour must rest in the image novv to the third argument vvhich is iolly and vvorthy the vvild wit of a mad minister christ vvould not so much as bovv his knee vnto the diuell although he vvould haue giuen him the vvhole vvorld for doing of it therfore we must not adore images true if the image were master bezas ensigne or of their master the diuell or any of his hel hounds our sauiours refusing to bow his knee to the diuell is not brought to proue the vnlawfulnes of worshipping images and yet some of your saincts are not much better then thomas becket but to shew that bowing the knee is a worship how light soeuer you accompt of it forbidden by god himselfe vnder the name of worship to be giuen to any but himselfe m perkins his fourth reason a man saith he may be vvorshipped vvith ciuill honor not vvith religious which is vvholy prescribed in the first table and yet the meanest man is a more excellent image of god than any painted one ans a man may be worshipped vvith religious honor in respect of his supernaturall gifts asvvell as vvith ciuill honour of his naturall properties as hath bin before declared and no other religious honor is either prescribed or proscribed in the first table then such only as is proper to god you should haue answered his proofe as well as you denie his proposition master perkins holds that all religious worship is proper to god and therefore conteined in the first table you answere that no religious honor is prescribed or proscribed was it you that found fault with master perkins ryming in the first table but such only as is proper to god your aduersarie graunteth as much and addes that all religious honor is proper to him but saith he thomas of vvatering holds that the crucifixe is to be adored vvith the same honor that christ is leauing thomas of vvatering and of vvapping to them that deserue it i ansvvere to the place of s thomas of aquine that he speaketh like a most learned philosopher and diuine very profoundly that the image may be considered in it selfe and so he saith it is not to be vvorshipped at all or as it doth conuey our mind vnto that vvhich it doth represent and so because there is but one and the same motion of our vnderstanding and vvill towards christ and the crucifixe vve doe adore them both at once with the same act of adoration but in a farre different degree for christ vve adore properly as the true god but the crucifixe accidentally as a thing ioyned with christ euen as saith he expounding himselfe article when one doth his homage vnto the king he vvorshippeth vvithall his purple garment not that any worship is due to the robe but the whole is giuen vnto the person which cannot be separated from that which is so closely ioyned to the person euen so the diuine person of christ is properly adored but improperly all things conceiued together vvith it are said also by that deep doctor to be adored he that hath care of hearing let him heare for our purpose it sufficeth to knovv that he assignes very small vvorship to themselues thomas of waterings is the old english name of thomas de aquino the place may so be called because of some chappell or religious house built there in honor of him it was not master perkins intent nor his veine to disgrace thomas by that name though he do not acknowledge any such sainctship belonging to him in your answere first you graunt that tho q article thomas saith we must worship the crosse of christ with diuine worship therefore you graunt as much as master perkins affirmes and thereby prooue that to be false which before you deliuered that the worship you giue to images is very small for you worship some of them by your owne confession with diuine worship it appeareth also by this answere that your images are not only to stirre vp deuotion ampc but to be worshipt too secondly i would faine know how this doctrine of thomas can agree with that of bellarmine who will haue the honor to rest in the image and not to be only accidentall and vnproper thirdly this distinction doth in no sort satisfie vs who denie that an image may be worshipped in any respect whatsoeuer to the proofe out of arist de memor amp reminise aristotle i answer more particularly that thomas presupposeth that which we deny that it is lawful to haue such an image to such purposes besides if all he say be graunted him he doth not prooue that it is lawful to intend worship to the image but that the worship performed to the partie whose image it is by occasion of the image is also giuen to the image though to the one principally to the other but accidentally lastly to the similitude i say it is not true that he which doth his homage to the king doth worship his purple garment because it is no part of him neither should he that had worshipt christ hanging on the crosse at the time of his passion haue worshipped the crosse together with christ no more then he that worships the king being on horseback worships the horse on which he rides indeede he that worships christ worships him god and man though the worship be done to him only in respect of his godhead but the reason is that chrst is as well man as god there is no such coniunction between the image and the partie whose image it is and therefore for our purpose it sufficeth to know that how small honor soeuer he or you assigne to the images themselues if it be religious it is idolatrous if ciuill ridiculous but what should i spend time in refuting this distinction of thomas when as one of your owne schoolemen hath done it anno long ago our countreyman robert ho cot in lib sapient l ct holcot hauing propounded the question whether it be lawful for christians to adore any images and hauing proued it unlawful as by other reasons so by the second commaundement obiects against himselfe out of thomas in this sort to this question saith he thomas answereth that an image may be considered two waies either as it is an image and so no honor is due vnto it as none is due to wood or stone otherwise it may be considered as there is the same motion to the image and to that whose image it is and so the same honor is due to the image and to him whose image it is but against this answere saith holcot i obiect first thus diuine honor is due to god only but no image is god therefore such honor is due to no image therefore it implies a contradiction to say that diuine honor is due to god only and yet that it is due to the image of christ and to christ beside if the same honour be due to the image of christ and to christ the same honor is due also to a stone and to christ and by consequence the same honour is due to christ and to a creature which is not to be beleeued againe he that worships any thing with diuine honour confesseth it to be god therefore if any man might lawfully giue diuine honor to the image of christ he might lawfully protest and confesse something that is not god to be god therefore saith holcot in his conclusion it may otherwise be said that no adoration is due to an image and that it is not lawful to adore any image for true adoration is in spirit and deuotion and in the highest degree of loue and this we may not direct to any creature augustine and long after him gregorie in plaine tearmes denieth images to be adored lastly m p ins saith without quoting any place that augustine and gregorie in plainetearmes deny images to be adored and so do we too taking adoring as they do for the vvorship that is proper to god the places alleaged being vnknowne to you your answere must needes bee made by gesse and indeede agrees not with either of them which master perkins quotes for edit he quotes both particularly though you denie it august de morib ecclesiastes cap austin speakes of the idols of the gentiles and i hope you will not allow them any kinde of worship not onely not adoration master perkins truly holding all your images that you worship to be idols also condemnes the adoring of them by that place of austin though it be intended specially against the idols of the heathen gregor lib epistle gregories testimonie in the place quoted by master perkins allowes no further vse of any images than to bee lay mens books they are not set vp in the churches saith he to be adored but onely to instruct the mindes of the ignorant if they were set vp to be worshipped with any kinde of worship how is this speech of gregories true but indeede there was no religious worship but adoration knowne in gregories time and that was proper to god as religion it selfe is the papists defend their opinions by these reasons i psalm cast downe your selues before his footestoole answer the wordes are thus to bee read bowe at his footestoole that is at the arke and mercieseat for there hee hath made a promise of his presence the words therefore say not bow to the arke but to god at the arke the first reason by him proposed is this psalme cast dovvne your selues before his sootes oole vvhich vvas the arke novv if the arke vvere to be vvorshipped because it represented god foot stoole much more may the image be vvorshipped m perkins ansvvereth that the vvords must be englished thus bo at or before the arke notto the arke but to god before the arke reply if it were so yet must they admit that wee must kneele at or before images so we kneele to honour or pray to god against which some of their preachers do crielike mad man but the hebre phrase carryeth that wee must kneele to the arke as they who be sk lfull in the language do know and that the arke was worshipped of the israelites is otherwise very euident for first none but the high priest might come into the place where it was and it was carried before the campewith great solemnitie regina cap to search out a reasting place for the whole host and when they were to sight against the philistins they had great confidence in the presence of the arke and cap of the bethsamites were slaine for seeing the arke and regina oza vvas by god smitten to death for touching the arke doth not all this conuince in vvhat reuerence the arke vvas had euen by god owne testimonie your first reason to prooue the worshipping of images is this if the arke were to be worshipped because it represented god footstoole much more may the image be worshipped but the arke was therefore to be worshipped therefore much more may the image be worshipped i denie your whole antecedent first the consequence of your proposition for it doth not follow that we may worship images deuised by man to represent god because we may worship the arke where god himselfe promised his presence and which he did appoint as an assurance of his presence if you can shew vs the like promise to your images you say somewhat else nothing your assumption also is false the arke was not to be worshipped to your proofe master perkins answers truly that the psalme doth not commaund worshipping of the arke but worship before the arke you replie first that therefore it is lawful to kneele before images i answere your consequence is false because your images are your owne wicked deuices and haue no promise of god presence therefore it is senselesnes to kneele before them not madnes to crie out against such follie your second replie is that the hebrew phrase carrieth it that we must kneele to the arke as the skilfull in that language know first remember that these are authors in the ayre as you answered about that place of daniel secondly know that they that are skilfull say otherwise what say you to the chaldae paraphrast ad psalm chaldee paraphrast who expounds it worship in the house of his sanctuarie and yet he keepes the proposition that is in the hebrew so doth the latin translation in the same psalme where the same proposition is vsed verse adorate in monte sancto eius worship in his holy mountaine the chaldae paraphrast ad verse chaldee hath in the mountaine of the house of his sanctuarie the graec greeke not much vnlike in or toward his holy hill the same seemes to haue been theodor in psalm theodorets iudgement of the place in question his footstoole was sometimes thought to be the temple at ierusalem but now the churches which are ouer all the earth and sea wherein wee worship the most holy god of the same opinion is vatablus ad scabellum vatablus cast downe your selues before his footstoole that is as hee expounds himselfe in his note there in the temple or before the arke in which god exhibited his presence so doth lyra ad psalm lyra interpret it who was a iew borne and a christian by profession worship his footstole that is before his footstoole the glosla ordin amp interlin ibi ordinarie and interlinear glosses expound it out of chrysost de trinit ambros de spirit sanct lib aug in psalm the fathers of christs manhood to be worshipped by reason of the hypostatical vnion of it with the godhead what is that to the worshipping of images for the further auowing of that translation we haue also r dauid kimchis ibid r dauid kimchis authoritie lastly you bring diverse proofes that the arke was had in great reuerence all needlesse for who denies it was there not great reason to esteeme highly of that whereby god was extraordinarily present with the iewes as with no people nor in any place of the world beside what then was it therefore worshipped by the priest when he went in once a yeere where it was did the people worship it when it was carried before them as sam for that confidence the iewes put in it they got little by it because they superstitiously abused it against god commandement putting trust in the presence of it abroad when it should haue been in the tabernacle where god had promised his presence with it was this worship to the arke which the lord deliuered into the hands of the philistins sam neither were those bethsamites slaine for not worshipping it but for presuming to looke into it and sam vzzah for touching it not because he did not worship it to this may be added the authoritie of s ierom epistle ap vvho doth teach that it vvas the more vvorshipped for the cherubines and pictures of angels that vvere erected at the endes of it vvhereby he declareth that he thought images vvorthie of religious vvorship of ieroms epistle alleaged by master perkins to proue that rome is babylon you answere thus good sir if s ierome had meant that that epistle should haue had his authoritie he would haue set it out in his owne name which seeing he thought it not expedient set the authoritie of it aside and vrge his reasons if you thinke it worth your labour and you shall be answered these your owne words shall serne in steed of answere but for the satisfying of all man i will set downe ieromes words that they may see with what care and truth you cite the testimonies of the ancient writers the iewes saith ierome in former times venerabantur sancta sanctorum worshipped the holy of holies because there were the cherubins and the propitiatorie and the arke of the testament manna aarons rod and the golden altar doth ierome teach in these words that the arke was the more worshipped for the cherubins and pictures of angels that were erected at the end of it first he makes no mention of any pictures of angels but onely of the cherubins secondly he speakes not of worshipping the arke but the holy of holies because of the things that were in it thirdly he makes the propitiatorie manna aarons rod and the golden altar causes of that worship as well as the cherubins lastly in the words following he counts the sepulchre of our lord venerabilius more worthie of worship but to answere plainly to your false allegation of ieromes authoritie what an indignitie were it to the maiestie of god that the assurance of his presence should be the more worshipped because of the cherubins and pictures of angels that were erected at the ends of it which also with the arke it selfe were hid from all mens sight in the holie of holies ierome meaneth that those things made the people conceiue more reuerently of that holie of holies and strooke them with a kind of awe to this vve may ioyne that of s paul hebr that jacob by faith adored the top of his son iosephs rod so doth the greeke text of s paul say as erasmus also translateth it the protestant mangle the text pitifully to auoyde the place see the annotations of rhemes testament heb the text in the greeke is according to your owne editions worship vpon the top of his owne staffe so doth your interlin bibl ibi interlinear read it so arias montan ibi arias montanus erasmus ad erasmus notes the error of your old translator in leauing out the preposition which hee himselfe interpreteth ad as it were to ward the top the syriac inter pagnin ibi syriak translateth as we do vpon the top of his staffe vatablus ibi pagnine thus he worshipped leaning vpon his staffe ad summum aculi vatablus keepeth the words of the old translation but he expoundeth them in this sort adored that is saith vatablus giue thankes the top of his staffe toward the top of his staffe that is innixus baculo suo prae senecture leaning vpon his staffe for age theodor ibi theodoret maketh the adoration ciuill to figure out the kingdome of israel in the tribe of ephraim iacobs younger son your glossa interlin glosse saith he worshipped christ by whom he had domination and a scepter of authoritie in egypt or the kingdome of christ which in that was sigured to be and to come among the gentiles glossa ordin another glosse saith directly he worshipped god presently vpon his son ioseph swearing lyra ibi lyra layeth out the matter more largely and plainly after this manner iacob saith lyra beleeued that christ should be buried and rise againe in the land of promise therefore he made ioseph sweare that he would cause his body to be carried thither after he had sworne he worshipped god with thankes turning himselfe towards the beds head according to the translation of s ierome as it appeareth genes the translate as it is in this place and both are true for he worshipped towards the beds head which stood west toward which part the iewes doe worship and because he was old he had a staffe vpon the top whereof he leaned when he gaue thankes to god therefore we must not conceiue that he worshipped the top of the scepter or staffe but he worshipped god leaning vpon the staffe so doth theoph ib theophylact expound it leaning and resting vpon his staffe for age though he doth also follow the exposition of chrysost in hebr homily chrysostom concerning the kingdome of israel in the tribe of ephraim the same exposition bringeth occumenius the greeke scholiast out of photius apud oecumenium photius vpon the top of his staffe that is being now old the same bring lombard thomas caietan ibi lombard thomas and caietan it is strange that a man professing knowledge should speak so vntruly do we mangle the text pittifully or rather do not you slaunder vs shamefully we neither take away nor alter any word syllable letter or accent in the text but leauing that whole onlie adde two words in a different letter to make the meaning more plaine and that by aug qq in gen q augustines authority as your rhem test ad heb rhemists confesse and as i haue shewed with the allowance of your best interpreters for both the words i will conclude with that of ierome in this place saith hieron in quaest hebr in genes he some faine without cause that iacob worshipped the top of iosephs scepter because forsooth honouring his son he honoured his power but in the hebrew it is farre otherwise and israel worshipped saith the hebrew toward his beds head namely because after his son had sworne to him being assured of the thing he had requested he worshipped god contra caput ouer against his beds head obiect ii exod god said to moses stand a farre off and put off thy shooes for the place is holy now if holy places must bee reuerenced then much more holy images as the crosse of christ and such like ans god commanded the ceremonie of putting off the shooes that hee might thereby strike moses with a religious reuerence not of the place but of his owne maiestie whose presence made the place holy let them shew the like warrant for images the second reason is taken out of exodus where god said to moses put off thy shoes for the place where thou standest is holy novv if places be holy and to be reuerenced by reason of the presence of angels vvhy not asvv ll the image that representeth an angell or some saint vvhich is equall to angels master perkins his ansvvere rather confirmeth than solueth this argument for he saith that the ceremonie of putting off his shoes vvas commaunded to strike moses vvith a religious reuerence not of the place but of the person there present vvhich vvas not god but an angell as the text there expresseth exod the place then being holy required the reuerend respect of putting off his shoes and that reuerence done to the place stroke moses vvith a religious reuerence of the angelspeaking in the person of god euen so holy pictures being first duely reuerenced doe strike man vvith a religious regard of the saint represented your second reason is thus framed if places be holy and to be reuerenced by reason of the presence of angels why not aswell the image that represents an angell or some saint which is equall to an angell but places are holy and to be reuerenced by reason of the presence of angels therefore the image that represents an angell or some saint equall to an angell is holie and to be reuerenced i deny your whole antecedent and first the consequence of your proposition because although we should grant that some place were holy because of the presence of the angels yet would it not follow that therfore images are holy where there is no presence of an angell for all your consecrating and coniuring of images cannot make any angel or saint to afford his presence in them your assumption is false there is no holines in places because of the presence of angels as may appeare by the scriptures where their apparitions are described no action of reuerence at all being performed to the places of their presence in particular to your proofe m perkins answereth that this was done not because the place where angels appeare is holy but vpon an especiall commandement of god to strike moses with a reuerence of god maiestie who was there present you reply first that god was not present there but an angell i answere that god was there present as it is plaine because the angell was lehouah exod and lehouah saw that he turned to see and verse lehouah said yes the whole discourse sheweth that god himselfe was the angell namely the second person in trinitie who is called malac the angell of the conenant because he was sent for the saluation of god elect so act stephen though he call him an angell calleth him asse the lord and indeed who but god could say i am that i am exod as the angell there doth secondly you say the answere rather confirmes than solues the argument because as that astion strucke moses with a reuerence of the angell so holy pictures duly reuerenced strike man with a religious regard of the saint represented what is this but to beg the question you take it as graunted that there may be images and that religious reuerence may be giuen to them but these are the verie doubts we dispute of inded if it were true that there may be such images and that religious honour is to be yeelded to creatures there were somewhat in your similitude to the purpose and yet similitudes doe not proue but illustrate the sorce of your reason is that moses was commanded by god to put off his shoes that he might be striken thereby with reuerence of god therefore we must worship images that we may be striken with reuerence of angels and saints the consequence is naught god particular charge to moses at that time warranteth not man to enioyne worship to images that angels may be worshipped by them to this let vs annexe that dayes be truely called holy and vvorshipped as the first and last daies be truely called holy and vvorshipfull as the first and last daies of the feast of easter be exod and the vestments of priests exod because they are dedicated and employed to holy vses euen so images vvhich are made in honour of god and his saints and erected to mooue and teach vs to embrace heauenly courses adde it if you will that dayes appointed by god are called holy for of worshipfull dayes i thinke no man euer heard though your latine translation say eadem festiuitate venerabilis the seauenth day shall be venerable with the same festiuitie that is shall be kept with like solemnitie to the first the words in the hebrew are all one in the former and later part of the verse and therefore so should the translation be now in the former your translation is the first day shall be holy and solemne the hebrew as arias mon ad exod montanus translateth it on the first day shall be a conuocation of holines and on the seauenth day shall be a conuocation of holines that is as vatab ibi vatablus truly expounds the hebrew phrase an holy conuocation so doth pagnin ibi pagnine also translate it but this holines which you rightly expound to be a dedication or employment to god seruice neither doth require nor will admit any worshipping of the dayes or garments but images are not holy for they are neither commaunded of god nor allowed obiect iii it is lawful to kneele downe to a chaire of estate in the absence of the king or queene therefore much more to the images of god and of saintes in heauen glorified being absent from vs answer to kneele to the chaire of estate is no more but a ciuill testimonie or signe of ciuill reuerence by which all good subiects when occasion is offered shew their loyaltie and subiection to their lawful prince and this kneeling being on this manner and to no other ende hath sufficient warrant in the word of god but kneeling to the image of any saint departed is religious and consequently more then ciuill worship as the papists themselues confesse the argument then prooueth nothing vnlesse they will keepe themselues to one and the same kind of worship he proposeth our argument to the halfes or else this answere had been preuented for thus runneth our reason as the chaire of estate is to bee worshipped with ciuill reuerence in respect of the temporall prince whom it representeth euen so the images of holy personages that raigne now in heauen are to bee worshipped with a holy and religious kinde of curtesie for as temporall honour is due vnto a temporal prince so religious and spirituall honour is due vnto spirituall and most holy personages and as a good subiect testifyeth his loyaltie and good affection towardes his prince by honouring his regall throne so doth a good christian giue testimonie of his dutiful both estimation amp deuotion toward those heauenly creatures by giuing honour vnto their images at leastwise why do not the protestant exhibit ciuill reuerence aswell vnto the representations of god saintes as to the shaddowes of the secular maiestie vnlesse it be because they are fallen out with the saintes of god and are become adorers of sinfull man master perkins drew your argument from a comparison of quantitie as the logicians call it from the greater to the lesse you fetch it from a comparison of qualitie by way of similitude which as i answered before serues to make a thing more plaine not to prooue it true as the other comparison doth if it be rightly made you report his answere by halues for he denies the consequence of the argument which he propounded adding this reason of his deniall that the ciuill worship hath warrant sufficient in the word of god but your religious worship hath not so that either you must make your worshipping of images ciuill or else your comparison holds not his answere is sufficient to ouerthrow your reason as you propound it for it denies that the things are alike adding farther against your proofe that no religious honour is due to any but god only if you can shew warrant for it in the word he yeelds but alas you cannot your chiefe champion thomas of aquine hauing made an obiection against worshipping of the image of christ with diuine worship because there is no tradition to be found in scripture for the adoring of images is faine for answere to flee to vnwritten traditions we must answere saith thom q act ad thomas that the apostles by the familiar instinct of the holy ghost deliuered certaine things to the churches to be obserued which they haue not left in writing but only in the obseruation of the church by the succession of the faithfull and surely he that will take paines to consider the allegations of the seauenth council the s d at nice which was called of purpose to establish the worshipping of images shall finde very pittifull proofe out of scripture therefore hauing warrant and charge to performe all ciuill honor to princes we do accordingly hauing neither for any deuotion or religious reuerence to angels or man departed though saincts in heauen we dare not worship their images which also we know to be particularly forbidden in scripture and that is the reason why we giue no reuerence to any idolatrous representations of holy man now in heauen deuised by man to a purpose that hath no warrant by commaundement or example in scripture as for ciuill reuerence it is due to them only with whom we haue some dealing in worldly matters and so cannot belong to any in heauen and much lesse to their pictures without any liking of themselues differ iii the papists also teach that god may be lawfully worshipped in images in which he hath appeared vnto man as the father in the image of an old man the son in the image of a man crucified and the holy ghost in the liknes of a doue ampc but we hold it unlawful to worship god in by or at any image for this is the thing which as i haue prooued before the second commandement forbiddeth master perkins makes a third point of difference that wee may not worship god in any such image in which bee hath appeared vnto man in this we do not differ vnlesse he takes it otherwise then he deliuereth it those images wee hold more reuerend than any others as representations neerer approching vnto the diuinitie yet because they doe not expresse the deitie god is not directly apprehended not worshipped in them but onely by collection as for example the forme of a raue old man in daniel doth not represent god person but wee gather by that ancient forme god eternity whereby wee a se to a more perfect conceit of god whom wee adore now other images of christ and his saintes doe carry ou mindes directly vpon their proper persons whom in their images we adore and worship after their degrees but wee worship images with farre meaner reuerence than any of the saintes in regard onely that they doe represent such presonages and do induce vs more to loue and honour them and do stirre vp our dulnesse more often and ardently to honour god in the saints and the saints in their degrees as also to imitate their holy example as hath bin said more than once that all may vnderstand how far off we are from giuing god honour vnto either saint or image do you not differ from master perkins in worshipping god in the images in which he hath appeared first he saith that it is unlawful to worship god in by or at an image those are his words in this very place secondly do you only hold those images more reuerend then other do you not giue them diuine honour euen the same honor that is due to god himselfe though accidentally as you hold against bellarmine is not thomas his reason for worshipping the image and crosse of christ with diuine honour as strong for the image of god the father and of god the holy ghost but what should i goe about to prooue so plaine a matter i would your being ashamed to defend so grosse idolatry would make you forsake it do you not graunt that you worship god in these images though as you say here not directly how do you then agree with master perkins who deliuers his meaning plainely that in such images god may not be at all worshipped no not by them nor at

master perkins of seeming to take the matter otherwise then he deliuers it by person you meane one property of god common to all three persons or else the nature of the godhead but i pray you tell me by what warrant of scripture you paint god the father like this old man in daniell if you do it not by the authoritie of this place if it be the end of this picture to signifie god eternitie surely he that appropriates this image to the father makes the father only eternall this is that more perfect conceipt of god that you come to by this image namely to denie the eternitie and so the godhead of the son and the holy ghost further giue me leaue to vnderstand you if i can what can you possibly know concerning god eternitie by the sight of this graue old man if you did not beleeue that god is eternall before you looked vpon that image it is not possible you should learne it or giue credit to it by seeing the picture especially if it represent not as you speake the person of god but indeede the gazing on such idols is more likely to draw man into a conceipt that god growes old and so his eternitie is wearing away then to teach them that he neuer had beginning and neuer shall haue end you will replie that daniell doth so describe him true as the scripture euery where doth for our capacitie applying affections parts and actions of man to god the lord who of his infinite wisdome appointed the penning of these things for our instruction hath promised a blessing to euery part of his word that it may be read amp heard without danger but idols are accursed by him euen such

images as i shewed before out of your owne writers you giue the same honour that you do to the saincts themselues because thomas teacheth you out of aristotle that there is but one motion of our vnderstanding and will towards the sainct and the image of the sainct and the fact of the israelites exod in worshipping the golden calfe is condemned as flat idolatry albeit they worshipped not the calfe but god in the calfe for verse aaron saith to morrow shall be the solemnitie of iehouah whereby he doth giue vs to vnderstand that the calfe was but a signe of ehouah whom they worshipped obiect it seemes the israelites worshipped the calfe for aaron saith verse these be thy god o israel that brought thee out of egypt answer aarons meaning is nothing else but that the golden calfe was a signe of the presence of the true god and the name of the thing signified is giuen to the signe as vpon a stage hee is called a king that represents the king and augustine saith that images are wont to be called by the names of things whereof they are images as the counterfeit of samuel is called samuel and wee must not esteeme them all as mad man to think that a calfe made of their earings being but one or two daies old should bee the god that brought them out of egypt with a mighty hand many daies before and these are the pointes of difference touching images wherein wee must stand at variance for euer with the church of rome for they erre in the foundation of religion making indeede an idoll of the true god and worshipping an other christ then we doe vnder new termes maintayning the idolatry of the heathen and therefore haue wee departed from them and so must wee still doe because they are idolaters as i haue proued but this poynt of difference is made to bring in a common ar ument of theirs to wit that the worshipping of the golden calfe is condemned as flat idolatry exod and yet the israelits worshipped not the calfe but god in the calfe to which we say they did not worship the true god in the calfe but the god of the egyptians which was taken by them to haue the shape of a blacke calfe with white spots see s augustine lib de ciui cap and therefore making the golden calfe to represent this false god and att ibuting their deliuerance vnto that supposed god and not vnto the god of israel committed idolatry which the text prooueth most manifest these be thy god that brought thee out of egypt m perkins answereth that the meaning is nothing else but that the golden calfe was a signe of the presence of the true god such glosses without any authority of the auncient fathers is idiculous being against the plaine text but sayth he we must not think them so adde as to take a calfe made with their care rings to be their god no but we may well thinke them so vngratefull vnto the true god their deliuerer that they did ascribe their deliu rance not to him but vnto that god which the aegyptians serued whose purtraiture was that calfe this point of difference is brought in not to auow any argument of ours but to answere a distinction of yours who being dri n to shifts thinke to help the matter by telling vs that the iewes worshipped the golden calfe and therefore were condemned to which we replie that the iewes did worship iehouah in or by the calfe which we prooue by the text it selfe s these be thy god that brought thee out of the lad of egypt but it was the true god that brought them out of egypt euen t iehouah you answere that they attributed their deliuerance to that false god of the egyptians then did they thinke the egyptian god to be iehouah for to iehouah do they consecrate the day of dedicating the calfe u tomorrow shall be the holy day to iehouah but how ridiculous a conceipt is this to faine that the iewes should imagin that the egyptians god was their deliuerer whereas they knew that the great wise man of egypt the chiefe worshippers of that god had striuen against moses and their deliuerance by all meanes possible exod till at last they and the power of their god were ouercome so that indeede it was impossible they should be so sottish as to dreame that the egyptian god had deliuered them and if this had bin their fault being a thing so monstrous and sensles god would certainely haue charged it vpon them when he laid out their sinne to moses but he rather accuseth them for breaking his commaundement by making a molten calfe affirming to it and proclaiming exod these are thy god that brought thee out of egypt this is farther confirmed by those two calues which in imitation of this regina ieroboam set vp to worship the true god by and so continued euen by regina iehu who destroyed the heathen idols the text prooues nothing for you these be thy god that brought thee out of egypt for the egyptians had no such calfe to their god though the oxe or calfe called apis as august de ciuit dei lib cap austin aith in the place alleaged was consecrated to their chiefe god serapis if we brought nothing for our

answere master perkins shewing that images are called by the names of the things they re and so that calfe made to be a token of iehouahs presence that brought them out of egypt is said to be the god

from yeelding obedience that he tooke this commandement of the emperour as an occasion to withdraw his allegeance from his soueraigne and seized into his hands all the authoritie that was yet remaining to the empire in italie this contention after the death of leo grew more hot in so much that his son constantine copronymus to make some good end of the matter assembled another concil

worth the decrees of that councell condemning images were by this repealed and a book written by expresse commandement of the councell of franckfort and published in the name of charlemaine in which as the councell of constantinople is reproued for taking away all vse of images euen for history and memory so that second councell of nice is particularly confuted and condemned the like entertainment found the decrees of that councell amongst our countri man here in england as you shall see by the testimony of a monke that writ yeeres agoe the anno mathae westmonast same yeere saith mathew of westminster charles king of the french man sent into britaine librum synodalem a booke of decrees wherin many things were found contrary to the true faith and that especially that it was determined by the ioynt consent of almost all the doctors of the east that images are to be adored which the catholike church vtterly detests against this albinus writ an epistle wonderfully endited according to the authority of the holy scriptures d carried together with that booke of decrees to the king of fr ce in the name of the bishops and nobles yet was not this councell of franckfort nor the epistle written by albinus nor the booke set out in charlemaines name of sufficient strength to stop the course of idolatry so violent it is where it finds any way made for it whereupon claudius taurinens episc claudius bishop of turin hauing bin brought vp and preferred by charlemaine opposed himselfe by writing afresh against it and as ionas aurelianens epistle ionas bishop of orleans saith who writ against him proceeded farther to cast them out of all the churches of his dioces this opinion and fact of his ionas writ against yet so as that he wholy agreed with him about the vnlawfulnes of adoring images against the second councell of nice but in the east the quarrels about images were more hot and dangerous synod parisiens pag which mooued the emperours michaell and theophilus to send their embassadors into france to the emperour lewis le debon naire the curteous son of charlemaine about the yeare to signifie to him that the superstitious abuse of images in their dominions had made them assemble a councell about the matter in which it was decreed that they should not be worshipped with incense lights kneeling prayers songs and seruice before them all which notwithstanding that some of their clergy refusing to yeeld obedience had withdrawne themselues to the pope of old rome complaining to him and slandering the east church that they therefore had sent their ambassadors both to him and to the pope for the clearing of themselues of all such false imputations and that they might vnderstand what the iudgement of their churches was in those points hereupon lewis the emperour called a nationall councel at paris the anno yere following wherein the conclusion was as in the councell of franckfort against both pulling downe and worshipping of images as appeareth by an epistle sent from the said synode to lewis and lotharius by two bishops italitgarius and flamarius and according thereunto answere was returned to the emperours michaell and theophilus thus much i

the eleuen first verses of this chapter do conteine a briefe description of christes teptations wherof i haue chosen to intreat hauing formerly handled the doctrine of conscience because all that endeuour either to get or keepe a good conscience are most of all subiect to temptations now here we haue the speciall temptations of the diuell wherewith he assaulted our sauiour christ and in christs example the best way to auoid the same this description consisteth of three distinct parts first a preface or preparation to a combate betweene christ and the diuell verse secondly the combate or conflict it selfe verse thirdly the issue or euent of this combate verse i part the preparation to the combate hath two parts first christs going foorth to that place where the combate was to be fought verse secondly his abode amp conuersing in that place verse christs going forth to the place is set out by sundry circumstances of the euangelists as the time when he went the authour of his going the maner how he went furnished the place whither he went and the end wherefore i circumstance the time when christ went foorth to be tempted is noted in this word then what time this was we shall see in the end of the former chapter where is set downe the baptisme of our sauiour christ by john in the river iordan as also the great honour and maiesty wherewith he was there renowmed for it pleased christ for speciall end and purpose to be baptized not as we are to put off sinne for he had none but to be ordained a mediatour for vs that putting on our sin he might beare the burden thereof in our steed againe in his baptisme he was distinctly proclaimed the doctour of his church for immediately thereupon the holy ghost descended vpon him like a doue and a voice came from heauen saying this is my welbeloued son in whom i am well pleased now so soone as christ was thus solemnly inaugurated into his office and proclaimed from heauen to be the sole doctor and prophet of god church euen then immediately without any delay was he driuen forth as marke saith chapt the vse in that christ is no sooner baptized but he is presently tempted we learne that all those who are truely baptized into christ must make account to be tempted and prepare for a combat with the diuell euen through the whole course of their liues for if satan durst be so bolde as to encounter with christ iesus the head of the church after his baptisme then doubtlesse he will not spare any of his members who are but weake amp sinfull man again in baptisme a man giues vp his name vnto god promising therein for euer to renounce all seruice to the diuell the flesh and the world and contrariwise to beleeue in god and to serue him and this vow being thus made it is the will of god he should be tempted that in the schoole of temptation he might learn to practise his baptisme but here most man wil say they neuer felt by experience in themselues the trueth of this doctrine for they haue not perceiued any such combate in themselues though they haue bene baptized many yeres agone answer such man whatsoeuer they be haue indeed the outward baptisme of water but they neuer yet receiued the inward baptisme of the spirit they weare christs liuery but as yet they do seruice vnto satan and though they haue been made partakers of the seales of the couenant yet still they abide within the kingdome of darkenesse for christ heere teacheth by his owne example that all those who haue receiued the inward baptism of the spirit whereby they haue effectually put off sinne and put on the lord iesus are as sure to be tempted by satan as himselfe was therefore let such persons as neuer yet felt in themselues this spiritual conflict now begin to reform their liues and to performe their vow of baptisme and they shal vndoubtedly find in themselues the truth of this doctrine that all that are baptized into christ shalbe tempted of the diuell so long as the children of israel continued vnder pharaos bondage they were not pursued by his army but when they set their faces toward the land of canaan then presently he makes after them with all his might and malice euen so while man liue in sinne and submit themselues to satans spirituall bondage he will suffer all things to be in peace with them but if once they set their hearts on the heauenly canaan and giue themselues syncerely to god seruice then will he with all his force pursue them amp meet them with armies of temptations to turne them backe into their olde way of sinne againe the silly bird that is in the snare or vnder the net so long as she lieth still feeles no harme but when she stirs amp offers to get away then begins her paine and the more she striues the more she finds her selfe ensnared so fareth it with silly man while they liue in sinne securely they are not troubled with satans temptations but when they beginne to leaue their badde courses and settle themselues to serue the lord then presently the diuel seeks to spread his net to intangle them in his snare the consideration whereof must teach vs to watch and pray that we enter not into temptation and as paul saith to put on the whole armor of god that we may be able to stand against the assaults of the diuell ephesian secondly in that our sauiour christ after his solemne inauguration into his mediatorship was immediatly to go to be tempted we learn that all those that are set apart by god to any speciall calling euen at their verie entrance thereinto must looke for temptations this befell the head and therefore all the members must reckon for it when moses was first called to be the guide and conducter of god people out of egypt exod hauing slaine an egyptian in defence of one of his brother vpon knowledge of the fact he was fain to flie from pharaos court into the land of madian and there to liue a shephers life for many yeres with his father in law iethro and dauid was no sooner appointed by god to be king ouer his people israel but sam saul began to persecute him and so continued all his dayes and our sauiour christ hauing called his apostles to their office of preaching his kingdome mat tooke them soone after to the sea and there falling asleepe suffered their ship to be so tossed with waues in a great tempest that they looked for nothing but present drowning so as they cried out master saue vs we perish and this the lord doth in great wisedome for the good of his children first to teach them that no man is able of himselfe to carry himselfe in any acceptable course of his calling without god speciall assistance and grace secondly to stir vp in them those good gifts and graces which he hath formerly bestowed on them as the feare of his name the loue of his maiesty the gifts of prayer faith patience and many other which he would haue tried in the entrance of their callings and exercised in the continuance therein vnto the end thirdly seeing christ begins his propheticall office of treaching his church with temptations this should admonish all ministers of the word that howsoeuer all god people must prepare themselues against satans temptations yet they must doe it aboue the rest for looke as in a pitched field the enemy aimeth principally at the standerd bearer euen so satan and his instruments do among all god people bend their greatest forces against the ministers of christ which holde vp his scepter and display his banner in the preaching of the gospel when iehoshuah the high priest stood before the lord satan stood at his right hand to resist him zak and when ahab went to fight against the king of syriah satan became a lying spirit in the mouth of prophets amp mo king this is that great red dragon that with his taile drew downe the third part of the starres of heauen that is of the ministers and preachers of the word and cast them to the earth revelation this is he that desired to winnow the disciples as wheat luke and as the king of aram said of ahab fight not against small nor great but against the king of israel only king so satan fighteth not against any so much as the prophets of israel the ministers of the church fourthly in that christ is tempted before he go to preach we learne that it is good and profitable for god ministers to be exercised with temptations euen of satan himselfe amp that for sundry causes first that they may know corinthian what temptations meane secondly that they may corinthian be the more able to minister helpe and comfort to those that are tempted thirdly to make them vnderstand the word of god aright for many places of scripture can not so well be vnderstood by bare study onely as by temptations act therewithall and it is true which one sayth well reading meditation prayer and temptation make a diuine ii circumstance the author or efficient cause of christes going foorth to wit the holy ghost noted in these words was led by the spirit the word led in the originall signifieth thus much that iesus was carried apart by the spirit which must not bee vnderstood of any locall transportation of his bodie from the river to the wildernesse as king elijah was caried from earth to heauen or as act philip was taken away from the eunuch and carried to azotus but it was a motion of the holy ghost wherewith christ was filled aboue measure and made willing to encounter with satan in that combat for so are the words by s luke luke being full of the holy ghost hee returned from iordan and was led by the spirit into the wildernesse that is by the inward motion and instinct of god spirit againe s marke saying mark the spirit droue him into the wildernesse giueth vs further to vnderstand that this motion in christ from the spirit was a peculiar motion not forced or constrained but voluntary and yet very strong and effectuall again by the spirit here is not meant the diuell or an euill spirit but the holy spirit of god he it was that moued christ to goe into the wildernesse so that the meaning is this after christ was baptized in iordan by john hee willingly tooke his iourney into the wildernesse being moued thereunto by a speciall and strong instinct of god holy spirit wherwith he was filled aboue measure if any aske how christ could be led by the spirit seeing hee sends the spirit answer these two may well stand together for christ must be considered two wayes first as man in the forme of a servant secondly as god euen the son of god yes god himselfe now as christ was man he was subiect to god prouidece and so was led and guided by the holy ghost but as he is god he is not subiect to prouidece but is the author therof and is not himselfe led or sent but together with the father sendeth the spirit the vse in this circumstance we may obserue first the exceeding holinesse of christs manhood in that he moued not from one place to another without the speciall instinct and direction of the spirit of god by which example we are taught to suffer our selues to be ordered and guided by the spirit of god in euery thing we take in hand yes in all our thoughts words and deeds for this is the true note of euery child of god to be led by the spirit rom where the apostle vseth the same word that s luke doth speaking of this leading of our sauiour to be tempted we must therefore labour to be of dauids disposition to haue our harts pliable to all god testimonies when god said seek ye my face dauids hart answered i seeke thy face o lord psalm and thus doing we shall suffer our selues to be directed and guided by the holy ghost for he teacheth and guideth man by the word secondly from this that christ was led vnto temptatio by the spirit of god we learne that temptations come not by chance nor yet by the will and pleasure of the diuel only for he could not touch iob or ought he had till god iob gaue him leaue nor enter into the heard of swine till christ said mat go but temptations come by god most iust permission and not without his speciall prouidence amp appointment this combat of christ with satan was decreed of god by his speciall appointment in his eternall counsell and therefore was christ led by the spirit to encounter with the diuell that he might performe this one worke of a mediator namely in temptation ouercome him who by temptation ouercame all mankind and as god appointed this combate of our sauiour so hath he also ordained the temptations of euery christian and the circumstances thereof the theater or place of this combat is this present euill world the actors are satan and euery christian the beholders are man and angels corinthian the vmpire and iudge is god himselfe who ouerruleth satan so as the issue cannot but be happie and blessed to those that fight manfully for hee casteth away none that be mighty amp valiant of courage iob he will giue an issue with the temptations corinthian from whence we learne sundry good instructions first when we are tossed and tried by manifolde temptations we must not thinke it strange but rather count it exceeding great ioy iam because it is god blessed will and ordinance that satan and euery christian should enter combat and conflict for the triall of his graces in them secondly we are hereby taught to labour with patience to beare all trials and afflictions not vsing unlawful means to winde our selues out of them because they come by the speciall prouidence of the almighty thirdly christ went not to be tempted till he was led by the spirit therfore no man must wittingly put himselfe into danger without a calling from god left therein hee tempt god indeed a man may be moued extraordinarily to offer himselfe into places of danger thus act paul went bound in the spirit to hierusalem that is he willingly followed the motion of the holy ghost which inwardly enforced him to go thither and the same may be said of many holy martyrs who though they might haue escaped by flight yet did willingly offer themselues into the hands of their persecutours and endured the violence of their torments which wee must thinke they did by a special motion of the holy ghost otherwise for a man to offer himselfe into danger without all warrant from god is to swarue from the practise of christ in this place fourthly christ being ledde by the spirit did not seeke to shrowd himselfe from this combate so likewise if a man follow his calling according to god will and thereupon fall into troubles and temptations he may not seeke to escape them by neglecting his duty but with courage and patience must inure himselfe to beare them wayting on the lord by wel doing for his deliuerance heere it may well be asked whether a man can lawfully and with good conscience abide in those places which are certainly knowen to be haunted with euill spirits answer some indeed are so venturous amp bold that they feare nothing yet the trueth is no man ought on his own head abide or lodge in such places vnlesse it be within the compasse of his calling or els haue a true extraordinary motion of god spirit so to doe we are therefore rather to auoid them than wittingly and willingly thrust our selues into the danger of such places for if god haue giuen liberty vnto satan to possesse such places as haue been consecrated to idolatry or defiled by oppression and bloud or such like abhominations why should wee without warrant from god put our selues into his hands this also may serue to reprooue those man who presume so much vpo their strong faith that they neuer sticke to thrust themselues into most lewd company but let such persons beware for places of bad company are places of danger by reason of that power and liberty which satan hath among them for there he hath a throne revelation how then can it be that they should cleane escape the infection of sinne who do vsually conuerse with those that commit it without controlement pro he that walketh with the wise sayth salomon shall be wise but a companion of fooles shall be made woorse so the words signifie and therefore his counsell is pro not to consent when sinners entise vs nor to pro make friendship with the angry person nor to go with the furious lest we learne their wayes and receiue destruction to our soules fiftly in this leading of christ by the spirit we learne a further thing so long as christ was a priuat man he liued with ioseph and mary a priuate life but being baptized and thereby installed in his office of mediatour he returnes not to bethlem or nazaret where he was borne and brought vp but gets him presently into the wildernesse thereto encounter with satan and that by the motion of the spirit wherein we may see that all that are appointed and set apart by god for any speciall calling are in some sort changed by his spirit and as it were made other man when saul was anointed to be king the text sayth god gaue him another heart sam and when dauid psalm was made of a shepheard a king he was furnished for that place as his behauiour shewed which was such as did beseeme a king thus the apostles of our sauiour christ of poore fisher man altogether acts vnlettered by the gift of christs calling corinthian were made able ministers of the new testament and so became indeed fishers of man mark which serues to confute such man as plead extraordinary callings as many haue done some saying they were elijah some john baptist ampc for if these were such man and had receiued such extraordinary callings then should they withall haue beene endued with extraordinary gifts fit for those callings but no such thing befalleth them nay it is plaine they remaine the same man they were before without any change at all in respect of gifts fit for such persons as they pretend themselues to be and to apply this to our selues we are all by nature the children of wrath and enemy vnto god but by grace we are made kings priests and prophets kings to rule ouer the world and the diuell in respect of their prouocations vnto sinne as also to subdue in our selues our owne euill lusts and affections priests to offer vp spirituall sacrifices vnto god as prayers and praises for his daily blessings and prophets to instruct our selues and others in the wayes of god according to our gifts and calling now then it behoueth vs all to become new man and to leade new liues fitting and sutable to our holy calling giuing our selues wholly to the honour and seruice of god shewing hereby that we are hereunto called by his spirit of grace and holinesse so shall we colos walke woorthy of the lord and shew foorth the vertues of him that hath called vs pet iii circumstance how christ went furnished into this place of combate which though our euangelist matthew hath omitted yet hath s luke plainly noted saying he was filled with the holy ghost luke if any shall say this seemes to import that christ wanted the the fulnesse of the spirit all the former part of his life if now only after his baptisme he were filled therewith i answer this fulnesse of the spirit is ascribed vnto christ after his baptisme not as though he formerly susteined any want of the spirit but because at his baptisme he receiued a greater measure of the spirit than he had before for this we must know that christ was alwayes filled with the spirit being an infant he had a full measure of gifts fit for his infancie and still as his growth in yeres required moe graces of the spirit he increased therein hauing in his youth amp in his riper yeres full measure of gifts fit for his estate in those times and at his baptisme being inaugurated into his mediatourship he receiued such fulnesse of the spirit as was behoouefull for so high an office which because it was farre greater than before he needed therefore is he now sayd to be filled with the holy ghost so that though christ were alwayes full of grace yet he increased therein as his estate and calling did require the vse this serues to confute the papists who teach that christ had all fulnesse of spirit in his infancie euen from his conception and birth and did not grow in grace at all saue only experimentally as he had occasion to manifest the same more and more in practise but s luke sayth plainly that iesus increased in wisdome and stature and in fauour with god and man luke againe christ was like vnto man in all things sinne only excepted and therefore did increase in grace as man doth in gifts from time to time further christ goeth thus furnished to this combate that he might be able to encounter with satan hand to hand and at the end giue him the finall ouerthrow thus he furnished moses exo for his embassy vnto pharaoh and sam dauid for his combate with goliah aholiab and exod bezaliel for the worke of the tabernacle and euery one whom god imployeth about any speciall worke is furnished and fitted thereto of god with speciall gifts whereby in euery age we may see whom god placeth in any calling for they are well qualified for the duties thereof and therefore those that want gifts meet for their callings doe thrust in themselues thereto and are not placed therein of god iv circumstance whither was christ led to be tempted namely into the wildernesse that is the place chosen of god for this combate there be diverse opinions touching this place some thinke it was a little wildernes betweene ierusalem and iericho some the desert of palestina others the great desert of arabia where elijah fasted forty dayes and forty nights and where the israelites wandered forty yeeres but seeing the holy ghost doth not define what wildernes this was we are not curiously to inquire after it but only know it was a desert and solitary place let vs rather search into the reasons wherefore he chose a desert place for this combat and they are diverse first because he was to worke our redemption in great humility euen in the base and low estate of a servant for the satisfying of god iustice in that nature which had sinned therefore he would not goe to ierusalem there to shew his glory and godhead as a little before he was proclaimed in his baptisme but he gets himselfe to a desert place void of all pompe and glory where he meant to begin this great worke for vs by encountring with our chiefest aduersary secondly hee chose this place for the more easie encountering with our aduersarie satan whom he was to ouercome for vs for if christ after his baptisme should haue shewed the glory of his godhead satan durst not haue medled with him therefore as the fisher hides the hooke and shewes the bait to entise the fish so our sauiour christ with the vaile of his flesh in this base estate and solitary place did couer the glory of his godhead that satan seeing him only in this low degree might be the more eager and bolde to set vpon him thirdly christ was willing to giue vnto his aduersarie the aduantage of the place that therewithall he might giue him the greater ouerthrow for the diuell delights mark in desert and forlorne places and there he would chuse to practise his temptations because in such places man want those helps and comforts which in society they may finde hence salomon sayth ecclesiastes woe be to him that is alone yes god himselfe sayd of man in the state of his innocence gen it is not good for man to be himselfe alone and that satan takes aduantage of such solitarinesse appeares by his tempting of eue when she was apart from her husband ge fourthly the praise and honour of this victory ouer satan was peculiar to christ and not communicable to any creature and therefore christ chose a desert place for this combate apart from all humane society that no man might challenge any part of this glory to himselfe but that it might be wholly christs as of right it was fiftly he went into a desert place for a time that afterward he might thence returne with more credit reuerence and authority to exercise his propheticall office for we see by experience that when a man hath beene abroad for some time he is receiued with more reuerence at his returne the vse from hence the church of rome would fetch a ground amp warrant for their monasticall life saying that as christ went apart into this desert so may man sequester themselues from ordinary societies and liue as monks and heremites in cloisters woods and deserts but this collection is absurd as may appeare by these reasons first christ went not thus apart on his owne head but by the instinct and motion of the spirit of god but the papists admit and vndertake the state of eremiticall and monasticall life without any warrant in god word secondly christ did thus sequester himselfe but once for a certeine time but with them an heremiticall estate is ordinary and perpetuall for their whole life thirdly our sauiour christ fasted truly all the while he abode in the wildernesse but papists in their cloisters and hermitages doe plentifully inioy the wealth of the world in great ease and liberty and therefore howsoeuer solitarinesse for a time may be commendable in some cases as to meditate on the works or word of god as isaac did gen or for the exercise of luke prayer and fasting in more earnest maner yet the eremites life being a perpetuall forsaking of humane societies is neither warrantable by god word nor commendable in god child v circumstance the end why christ went into the desert namely to be tempted of the diuel wherein obserue three points how hee was tempted wherefore and by whom for the first to tempt in scripture is ascribed to god to man and to the diuell god tempteth man when he prooueth him that is when he maketh manifest what is in his heart for sinne or grace which before were hid to the world thus god tempted abraham in the offer vp of his son gen and christ the ruler luke man tempteth god when he prooueth by unlawful meanes whether god be so powerfull iust and mercifull as the scriptures doe affirme him to be and thus the israelites tempted god when they required meat for their lust and sayd can god prepare a table in the wildernesse psalm the diuell tempteth when he allureth vnto sinne by inward suggestions or outward obiects and hereof must we vnderstand christs tempting in this place to wit that he was led into the wildernesse for this end that satan might assault him and vse what meanes he could to bring him vnto sinne if any shall thinke it was too much derogatory to the dignitie of christ to be thus tempted i answer if it had so pleased him christ could haue confounded the diuell with the least word of his mouth for as he is creator of heauen and earth so satan had no power to tempt him for god can not be tempted with euill iam but here christ stood in our roome and sted as he did vpon the crosse encountring with satan for vs as if we in our owne persons had been tempted this therefore must be vnderstood as a part of christes humiliation in his manhood whereto he subiected himselfe for our sakes otherwise the diuell could not haue tempted him obiect this stands not with the holinesse of christ as he is man to be tempted of satan answer yes he might be tempted of satan without sinne as our first parents were before their fall this will plainly appeare by comparing christ with other man in their temptations the diuell in tempting a man to sin first conuayes into his minde either by inward suggestion or by outward obiect the motion or cogitation of that sinne which he would haue him to commit thus he tempted iudas by ioh casting into him this euill thought iudas betray thy master and so dealeth hee with christ in this temptation he conueyed to his mind or apprehension the vnrighteous cogitations of vnbeleefe idolatry and couetousnesse yet so as christ receiued them not but with all power of grace repelled them secondly as satan conuayes euill suggestions into mens minds so the same are full of trouble sorrow amp vexation at least to the godly for when satan presseth vpon man his temptations the whole man is disquieted his thoughts and affections are troubled and his heart is vexed and this also was in christ he felt sorrow amp molestation in himselfe through these temptations as appeareth by his auant satan vpon his last assault and thus farre was christ tempted like vnto man thirdly in temptations vsually be corrupt motions for though a man do not approue neither enterteine with delight the diuels temptations yet shall he hardly keepe himselfe from the staine and taint of sin because the imaginations of his owne heart are naturally euill now herein christ differeth from all man in temptation for being perfectly holy in his humane nature he did not in the least measure receiue any corruption into his minde but by the power of grace did repel them more strongly than they were offered put a burning match to tinder or gunpowder and it will kindle presently but put it into water and that will quench it straight so it fareth in temptations our corrupt hearts like tinder do easily suffer corruption to kindle in vs but christes most holy heart did presently like water quench the euill of satans motions and thus we see how christ was tempted and yet without sinne the vse hence we may obserue a good direction for their comfort that are troubled with blasphemous thoughts among other temptations that befall man in god church the diuell doth mightily assault some man by casting into their minds most fearefull motions of blasphemie against god the father the son and the holy ghost whereby he doth greatly astonish them and bring them to despaire now the ground of their stay and comfort hence is this there be incident to the minde of man two kinds of euill thoughts first such as arise from the flesh that is from our corrupt nature and the very first motions of these are sinnes forbidden in the tenth commandement secondly there be others that rise not inwardly from the flesh but are from without conuayed into the minde by the diuell as these most horrible blasphemies against god which would make a godly heart to tremble and quake once to thinke vpon now these are our heauy crosses indeed when we be assaulted with them but the diuels sinnes wholly and become not ours till we receiue them by some degree of delight or assent as may hence appeare for christ was tempted to infidelity couetousnesse and idolatry yet his holy heart receiued them not and so they neuer became his sinnes the second point to be considered in this circumstance is wherefore christ was tempted for it may seeme strange that iesus christ the son of god yes very god equal with the father should be tempted the reasons therefore that mooued him to be tempted are these first that he might foile the diuell at his owne weapon for the diuell ouercame the first adam in temptation therfore christ the second adam would in temptation ouercome him secondly that in his example he might giue vs direction whereby to know the speciall temptations wherewith the diuell assaults the church as also how to withstand and repell the same for this cause no doubt hath the spirit of god so distinctly set downe christs preparation to this combate satans seuerall assaults and christes victory ouer them all which plainly confuteth the common opinion of ignorant people who thinke those that are tempted by the diuell to be most vile and wicked man such as haue forsaken god and therefore god hath forsaken them but beholde christ iesus the most holy person that euer was euen the holy one of god was tempted of satan and that exceeding sore hauing the same troubles and vexations thereby arising in his minde that wee haue insomuch as the angels came to minister cofort vnto him verse god dearest children therefore may and must be tempted for that is no token of a childe of wrath vnlesse we will say that christ iesus was the childe of wrath which once to thinke were most blasphemous thirdly christ was tempted that he might be a mercifull high priest vnto them that are tempted heb for himselfe knowing the trouble and anguish of temptation must needes in a more compassionate fellow feeling of their miseries bee readie to helpe and comfort his members when they are tempted the third point is the author of christs temptations to wit the diuell the name diuell signifieth a cauiller a slanderer and an accuser he is an accuser three waies he accuseth god to man man to god and man to man first god to man as when he told eue they must not die though they did eate of the forbidden fruit genes which was as much as if he had said god doth but deceiue you with that threatning yee shall not die at all secondly he accuseth man to god and therefore is called the accuser apocrypha of the brother and our pet aduersarie who goeth about like aroaring lyon which word aduersarie signifies one that enters plea or suite against vs thus he dealt against godly iob by the lordes owne confession iob thirdly he accuseth man to man by ingendring vngodly and vncharitable surmises and suspicions in one man against another and in causing one man to slander and iniurie another and for this cause is he said to worke in the children of disobedience ephesian and their wisdome is said to be diuellish who haue bitter enuying and strife in their heart iam the vse from this very name we are to be admonished of two things first to beware of false accusing tale bearing and slandering for in these practises we put on the diuels name and shew foorth the infection of his nature paul telling timothie tim that a minister must not be a nouice lest he be puffed vp and fall into the condemnation of the diuell vseth such a word for the diuels name as signifieth a false accuser or slanderer to shew vnto vs that such a one is a diuell incarnate and yet this is the common sinne of this age to speake euill and to backbite when they speake one of another secondly hereby we are taught to beware how at any time or any way we disswade any one from embracing or obeying true religion for heerein we shew our selues to be the children of the diuell when elymas the sorcerer would haue turned away sergius paulus from the faith paul act cals him full of all subtilty and mischiefe the childe of the diuell and this i doe the rather obserue because it is a vsuall thing to draw others backe from the power of godlinesse though not in plaine termes yet partly in reproches and partly by bad example of life now all such had need to looke to their estate for the children of the diuell are like to haue their portion with the diuell and his angels and thus much for the author of christs temptations as also for the first part of christs preparation to this combat and when he had fasted fortie daies and fortie nights he was afterward hungrie hee is the second part of christs preparation to this combate namely his abode in the wildernesse which is set out vnto vs by foure arguments i by his fasting forty daies and fortie nights noted in the words of this verse ii by his abode with wilde beast noted by s mark chap iii by his enduring of temptations within the space of these fortie daies and fortie nights luke though in particular those be not set downe by any euangelist iv by his hunger after fortie daies fasting in the end of this verse of these in order i circumstance christs fasting fortie daies and forty nights there be three kindes of fasts if we take the word in a generall sense first the daily fast of temperance and sobrietie whereby wee vse god creatures for our sustenance with that moderation and abstinence that we rather giue lesse to natures appetite then that which it desireth this christ inioineth to euery christian luke take heed lest at any time your hearts be oppressed with surfeting and drunkennesse the second kinde of fast is the religious abstinence of god church from all meates and drink for a time for the furtherance of their praiers when they humble theselues vnto god for the preuenting or remoouing of some heauie iudgement thus the iewes fasted iudg sam sometime for one day sometime for three daies and three nights hester yes sometime for sam chro seuen daies together but then it is like they receiued some sustenance in the euening for so daniel fasted for three weekes of daies eating no pleasant things daniel but of neither of these must christs fasts heere be vnderstood the third kinde of fast is miraculous done by the power of god restraining the appetite for many daies togither without meate or drinke beyond the power of nature thus exod moses fasted fortie daies and fortie nights in mount sina where he enioied the presence of god so long and so did elijah king fast in mount horeb and our sauiour christ in this wildernesse we reade indeed that paul in his conuersion fasted three daies and three nights eating nothing act so did the iewes with hester and her maides hest and experience teacheth that a sicke man may liue seuen or nine daies together without meate or drinke yes as some learned physitians write foureteene daies and pauls companions in his iourney to rome are very little or nothing at all for foureteene daies for the words are plaine act eating nothing and it may be so since the like hath beene found true by experience in our age and this is the longest that a man can fast and liue to wit foureteene or fifteene or seuenteene daies for so much is recorded of some that after so long abstinence haue liued though with some weaknesse of nature but for a man ordinarily being of good constitution of body to fast fortie daies and fortie nights togither is impossible indeed it hath beene auouched iubart parad decad that a man might fast monethes yes a whole yeare togither without meat or drinke and yet liue but we may perswade our selues it is not true now our sauiour christ which is yet more during this fast felt no faintnesse nor weaking of his body as we ordinarily do with a little abstinence so that his fast was not ordinary but miraculous altogither the reasons why christ fasted thus long in the wildernesse may be these first that he might performe his ministery which now he was to begin with more reuerence and authority for this cause would god haue moses to fast forty daies and forty nights before he deliuered the law written in two tables of stone vnto the people and so must elijah do before he did restore religion in his daies secondly that it might appeare he was no whit inferiour to moses and elijah and thirdly that he might shew his full consent with them quest seeing christ did farre excell moses and elijah why did he not exceed them in the length of his fast for threescore daies or a whole yeare answer hee did it not through want of power to haue fasted longer but because he would not giue occasion thereupon that any should call into question the truth of his manhood which might easily haue happened if he had fasted a whole yeere together the vse heereon the church of rome would build their lent fast but very fondly for first christ did not thus fast to giue vs example to follow him heerein but to prepare himselfe to the great worke of his ministery secondly there is great difference between christs fast and theirs christ fasted thus but once and that by the instinct of the holy ghost they keepe their fast yearely and that on their owne heads christs was a true fast without all meat or drink but theirs is a mocke fast for they eat the finest fish and other dainties and drinke wines wherein is as much nourishment to the body and as good as in flesh neither can they iustly build it on the practise of the primitiue church for they vsed to fast at least in some places but two or three daies before easter and their lent fast was not ordained nor imposed til many yeares after christ zanch deredempt l cap in the side quadrag iiunio so as euery one might choose whether he would fast or not ii circumstance s marke doth further set out christs abode in the wildernesse by his being and conuersing with wild beast mark which some thinke christ did for this end that wild beast might come to him and doe him homage due to their creator amp gouernour but this is a deuice of man without likelihood of truth for howsoeuer christ in himselfe deserued all homage and reuerence of all his creatures yet because he abode among wild beast to be abased and humbled in the low estate of a servant therefore it is not like he went to receiue homage from them the true cause rather is this we find in scripture that among the iewes were two sorts of deserts one in part peopled and inhabited hauing heere and there cities and villages in such a desert was john baptist borne and did baptize and preach that the prophesie of isay isay might be fulfilled the voice of a crier in the wildernes make straight the way of the lord the other not inhabited at all by man being a place of abode only for wild beast as lions beares tigers woolues ampc which liued therein continually now into such a desert as this was our sauiour christ led by the spirit and made his abode among such wild beast which circumstance is therefore noted to giue vs to vnderstand that in this combate our sauiour christ had no aid protection succour helpe or comfort from any man or other creature whatsoeuer for by nature his companions were so farre from being an helpe and comfort vnto him that they would rather seeke to deuoure him whereby we plainly see that the praise of victory in this combate is proper to christ alone and not communicable to any creature whatsoeuer the vse in this estate of christ in this wildernesse we may behold the condition of christs militant church to wit that it is in this world as in a wildernesse and desert of wild beast for during their abode on earth god children liue with man who in disposition and affection are like woolues beares tigers lions and cockatrices vntill such time as the holy ghost by grace shall turne their hearts as we may plainly see isay in regard whereof they must arme themselues with patience against manifold assaults and vexations comforting their hearts with this consideration that christ their head hath vndergone this estate before them iii circumstance s luke luke obserueth that while christ abode in the wildernesse within the space of those forty daies and forty nights he was tempted of the diuell before the three great temptations the words are plaine and was there fortie daies tempted of the diuell and when they were ended then the diuell said ampc what these temptations were either for matter or forme the holy ghost hath not set downe and yet we may probably thinke they were more milde and gentle temptations then those three which are set downe the diuell making them as it were an entrance to his strongest and most dangerous temptations for his maner is when it makes for his aduantage not to shewe his violence and extremitie at the first but to proceed by degrees and by little amp little to insinuate himselfe till he haue gotten his best aduantage and then wil he shew the strength of his malice thus he dealt with cain first he prouokes him to anger and malice against his brother because his brothers sacrifice was accepted and his reiected then hauing setled hatred in his heart he neuer leaues till he had caused him in his rage to slay his brother and yet he staies not there but after bring him to despaire of god mercy in so much as he cried out gen my sinne is greater then i can beare thus also he dealt with iudas first he cast this euill thought into his heart iudas betraie thy master and when he had gotten entertainment for that for doubtlesse iudas would not yeeld to so vile a thought at the first motion then he caused him to put it in execution whereupon in fearefull despaire he brought him to hang himselfe this is the subtiltie of the old serpent first he conuaies one claw or talant into a mans heart and then another after that he gets in his head and so at length windes in all his bodie thus he assaied to doe with christ and so will he continue towards all god children which should teach vs to labour to be strong in the lord and wise in his word that so we may stand against all his assaults yes this must mooue vs to a speciall watch through the whole course of our liues against the occasions of sinnes that we may cut off temptations in the beginning because it is satans craft not to spit his venom at the first but to sugar his temptations at the beginning that no danger may appeare till he haue conueled into vs the bane and poison of our soules iv circumstance christs abode in the wildernesse is further set out by his hunger in the end of this verse he was afterward hungry that is after he had fasted fortie daies and fortie nights by the power of his godhead then he began to wax hungrie but some will say this stands not with the glory and maiestie of the son of god to be hungrie for his flesh is meate indeed and his blood is drinke indeed answer christ was content to lay aside his glory and maiestie and to take vpon him our base and fraile nature becomming like vnto vs in all things saue sinne now in this his abasement and humilitie he had not onely a true soule and body but the true faculties thereof as vnderstanding will memorie ampc and though his body was free from personall infirmities as palsie gout dropsie or such like yet he was subiect to such infirmities as agree to the nature of man as hunger thirst wearinesse ampc yes this was one part of his humiliation to become not onely man but man with infirmities and therefore though he could by the power of his godhead haue preserued himself fortie yeares without meate or drinke as well as fortie daies yet that he might abase himselfe to the lowest degree of a servant he was content to sustaine the infirmite of his humane nature in being an hungred and that for these causes first to confirme vnto vs the truth of his manhood for some man might say it was an easie thing for him to fast fortie daies and fortie nights seeing he had not a true body but onely the shew and shadow of a body therefore to shew that he was true man and had a true naturall body as we haue he was content to sustaine hunger as we doe and that truely secondly that hereby he might cast an obiect before the diuell to cause him to be the more eager and violent in his temptations and to shew his malice in full measure against him for by vertue of his office whereto he was now called christ was to encounter with satan our common enemie and therefore giues him not onely the aduantage of the place but also the opportunity of estate that satan perceiuing his infirmitie of bodily hunger might thereby be emboldened to giue the more violent assault vpon him and thus much of the second part of christs preparation to his combat then came to him the tempter and said if thou be the son of god command that these stones may be made bread heere beginnes this strange combat betweene our sauiour christ and the diuell consisting of three great conflicts the first whereof is conteined in this verse and the next being indeed the greatest of them al as after shal appeare in this temptation obserue these three things first satans preparation to this conflict secondly the temptation it selfe thirdly christs answer and repulse made thereunto i point the diuels preparation is in these wordes then came to him the tempter and said heerein obserue foure things first the title giuen to satan the author of this temptation the tempter so paul calleth him thess i sent to know of your faith left the tempter had tempted you in any sort and satan is called the tempter because his continuall studie and practise hath beene and is by all meanes to tempt all man he omits no times neither spares any paines day or night but by all meanes seekes to draw man from god and to bring them to destruction the consideration wherof should mooue vs to the practise of these duties first to be watchfull in all maner of prayers and supplication against satan for the gratious protection of god against his assaults if any of vs had our dwelling among lions beares or tigers which were hungerbit and therefore would seeke greedily for their pray we would be sure neuer to go out of our dwelling houses without preparation for rescue amp defence whereby we might auoid their danger well though we haue no such wilde beast to endanger our body yet our soules are dayly assaulted by a more deadly enemie euen the diuell whose continuall studie and practise is by temptation to deuour vs pet and therefore we must alwaies be watchfull against temptations putting vpon vs the whole armour of god that we may be able to stand against his assaults secondly as it is the diuels practise alwaies to tempt and to seeke to draw man from god so because we must be vnlike him in all things we must draw neere to god in the practise of all good duties iames resist the diuell and he will flie draw neere to god and he will draw neere to you the coniunction of these two duties shewes that the neerer we come to god the more we oppose our selues to satan now he that commeth vnto god must beleeue heb and therefore by faith must we tim exercise our selues vnto godlinesse as paul exhorteth timothie and vnlesse we thus striue to be vnlike him we shall neuer be able to withstand his temptations thirdly we must hence learne to beware of the practise of seducers in seeking to draw backe others from the loue or practise of religion or in hindring the good meanes whereby religion is begun and furthered in man for if either by endeuour in action or by bad example we shall thus doe doubtlesse we become tempters and the children of the diuell for to tempt and draw to sinne is the propertie of satan and he that in tempting fulfils the lusts of satan must needs be his childe ioh hence it was that our sauiour christ cals peter satan when he went about to disswade him from that worke for which his father had sanctified him and sent him into this world saying get behinde me satan matthew and when elymas sought to turne away the deputy from the faith paul cals him enemy to all righteousnesse full of all subtiltie and childe of the diuell act the second thing in this preparation is the time when satan began to tempt our sauiour christ in a more strong and violent maner noted in this word then that is when christ had now fasted fortie dayes and fortie nights and was an hungred when the diuell saw christ not onely to be alone in the wildernesse but also perceiued that hee was afflicted with hunger and so the more weake being in the low estate of a miserable man then he prepares to assault christ with a most violent temptation the vse this discouereth vnto vs the deepe policie of satan in making choise of the fittest time for his assaults he will not tempt all man at all times neither alwaies with the greatest temptations but he forecasts for the time of mans greatest weaknesse and thereto he reserueth his strongest assaults now vsually a man is most weake when he is vnder some grieuous affliction either in bodie minde or both or when he lieth in the panges of death these times doth satan obserue and keep his strongest temptations against they come as doth notablie appeare by his dealing with christ not onely at this time when he was an hungred but also and especially at his passion for the scripture saith he coloss spoiled principality and powers vpon the crosse wherby is apparent that the diuell with his greatest power did then assault him thinking either then or neuer to giue him the foile when as he did sustain the wrath of god due vnto the sinnes of man and so will he handle all the members of christ in their greatest extremities they shall be sure to feele satans deepest malice vnlesse god restraine his power which must teach vs in the day of peace and strength to prepare against the day of weakenesse by any affliction or by death it selfe that so we may by god grace be able to stand against the rage of satan for then he will be sure most eagerly to seeke our ruine and vnlesse we prepare before hand we shall neuer be able to stand now our best preparation is to come to heare the words of christ and to do the same for then though the winds blow the raine fall the waues beat and satan do his woorst yet being built vpon the rocke christ iesus we shall neuer fall matth the third thing in this preparation is the occasion of satans onset at this time namely christs bodily hunger as the knitting of this verse to the former will plainly shew for christ being an hungred satan came vnto him and tempted him he could not find in christs most holy manhood any blemish of sinne or inclination thereto whereon to build his temptation yet such is his malice that rather then christ should escape his hands he will take occasion from the infirmitie of his nature in bodily hunger to prouoke and allure him vnto sinne heerein we learne a speciall point namely that the diuell will haue some ground in vs for those temptations wherewith he doth assault vs for as we may see by his dealing here with christ he obserues not onely the inclination of mans heart and soule but the state and constitution of the body that if either body or minde will affoord him the least aduantage thereon hee will be sure to take occasion to tempt if we regard the seed and root of sinne it is true that euery man hath all sinnes in him but yet through the worke of god restraining corruption in some and renewing grace in others it comes to passe that each man is more inclined naturally to some sinnes then to others which thing satan doth obserue most diligently and as an enemie that besiegeth a citie will goe about it and espie where the wall is weakest and most fit for his entrance and there will be sure to giue his strongest onset and as a man that would strike fire with a flint will turne it about in his hand to see what part is fittest euen so the diuell he goes about a man and as it were turnes him to and fro to spie out his weakenesse and to what sinnes he is most inclined and there he will be sure to trie him often and to assault him with greatest violence example if a man be impatient of pouertie he will seeke to carry him to picking and stealing if a man be proue to couetousnesse he will prouoke him to fraud and oppression if he be enclined to ambition satan will puffe him vp with pride and vainglory nay which is farre more satan will take occasion from the verie constitution of a mans bodie to draw him vnto sinne if choler be predominant in him satan will labour to stirre him vp to wrath anger and furie and if he can to bloodshed and murther if a man be of a sanguine complexion satan will seeke to carrie him to immoderate mirth and to excesse in pastimes pleasures and delight that if it be possible he may drowne him therein whether they be good or bad if a man be melancholike satan will sometime take occasion by that humour to strike him with exceeding sadnes with terror and feares and otherwhile to intoxicate his braine with strange fantasies and delusions causing a man to thinke himselfe to be elijah john baptist christ ampc so as it is true which an ancient diuine saith of this humour that it is the diuels bait wherewith hee sports himselfe see the experience heereof in the mat lunatike person whose disease was to be exceedingly troubled certaine times of the moneth by reason of melancholie oppressing the braine now satan as it there appeares tooke aduantage of that humour to abuse him most fearefully not onely in making him deafe and dumbe but also causing him to cast himselfe into fire and water so that looke how many sinnes and infirmities we haue in vs so manie dares we carry about vs wherewith satan will seeke to wound vs he taketh ground or occasion from vs of all the aduantage he hath against vs his temptations are like fire and bellowes and our infirmities and corruptions are wood and fewell the vse i hence then we may behold our miserable estate by reason of sinne for thereby it comes to passe that we beare about vs those darts wherewith the diuel doth wound vs and since satans craft and malice is such to take aduantage from vs for to worke our wo we must labour the more diligently to be throughly acquainted with our naturall dispositions and inclinations yes with our bodilie infirmities for the diuell will search vs and when wee haue truly found out our own estate we must set a strong watch and guard about our owne hearts in respect of our infirmities and so shall we be the better able to breake the necke of satans temptations the fourth thing in this preparation is satans comming to christ the tempter came vnto him by which phrase it is probable though not certaine that the diuell tooke vpon him the forme of some creature and so appeared vnto christ thus he came to eue in paradise abusing the serpent to further his assault against the first adam and it is like that in his combat with the second adam he came in the shape of some creature for otherwise he could not properly be said to come and speake some indeed thinke that these temptations were inward in minde onely and by vision others thinke they were altogether visible and done actually but the safest way is to holde that they were in part actually done in bodily maner and partly shewed in vision and thus much for the preparation to the first conflict ii point the temptation it selfe conteining matter of great importance being indeed the maine temptation of all in these words if thou be the son of god command that these stones be made bread the diuell being well prouided for time and place and aduantaged also by christs bodily hunger doth heere assault our sauiour christ like a cunning sophister and frame his argument syllogistically thus if thou be the son of god thou canst make these stones bread but thou canst not make these stones bread therefore thou article not the son of god the ground of this temptation is this it is no reason that the son of god should starue for want of food but thou must starue vnlesse thou canst make these stones bread and therefore vnlesse thou canst do so thou maist perswade thy selfe it was but a false voice which thou heardest from heauen this is my welbeloued son ampc the scope and drift of satan in this temptation standes in two things first hee labours to ouerthrow the faith of christ secondly to bring him to a practise of vnbeleefe for the first by faith i meane a gift or grace in christ wherby as he was man he beleeued his fathers words to be true which said this is my beloued son in whom i am well pleased whereby wee may see what the diuell aimes at principally in his temptations against god children for these his assaults against our sauiour christ are set down for our instruction in this behalfe satans maine drift then in temptation is to ouerthrow our faith whereby wee beleeue euerie part and parcell of god word to be true see this in his tempting of eue first he labours to weaken her faith in the trueth of god threatning which done he easily brought her to actuall disobedience in eating the forbidden fruit the same course hee holdeth at this day first he will seeke to nuzzell man in ignorance that he may keepe them in vnbeliefe if he faile that way then will he endeuour to plunge their soules into some damnable errour and heresie and by one of these meanes doth he destroy the faith of many for while a man remaines in ignorance he can haue no saith and if he misse of the trueth of god he wants ground for his faith now the reason why the diuell labours so much against our faith is because we cannot truely relie vpon god mercie nor depend vpon his prouidence nor yeeld any acceptable obedience to his commandements vnlesse we beleeue his word more particularly we are to obserue that special branch of god word which the diuell would haue christ not to beleeue euen that voice of his father which a little before christ heard from heauen at his baptisme this is my welbeloued son in whom i am well pleased and this hath the holy ghost recorded in great wisedome and mercie to god church for heereby doth appeare a main drift of satan against christs members in his temptations namely to make them doubt of their adoption and to destroy this perswasion in them that they are the sonnes and daughters of god for if heerein he spared not the head doubtlesse the members shall not escape his hands this appeares by his vsual assault against them specially when god shall lay vpon them any lingring crosse or affliction either in mind in body or in goods then the diuel will suggest this into their minds if thou werst the childe of god he would neuer lay his hand vpon thee so long a time and in so grieuous maner neuer was any child of god in this case that thou article in but god laies his hand thus heauie on thee and therefore thou maiest perswade thy selfe that thou article not the child of god the vse the consideration heereof must mooue vs aboue all things to labour for assurance of our adoption euen to haue our consciences assured out of god word that we are the sonnes and daughters of god in christ the diuels drift is to ouerthrow this perswasion in vs and therefore our endeuour must be to confirme and settle our hearts heerein this is the charge of the holy ghost vpon euerie childe of god pet giue all diligence to make your calling and election sure that is get the assurance thereof sealed vp in your hearts by the comfortable fruition and practise of the sauing graces of god spirit ioyning vertue with your faith and with your vertue knowledge with your knowledge temperance and with temperance patience and with patience godlinesse and with godlinesse brotherly kindnesse and with brotherly kindnesse loue verse and indeed if we would haue true peace and comfort in euery estate whether aduersity or prosperitie let vs labour for the knowledge of our adoption this will be our ioy in want in wealth in bondage in freedome in sicknesse in health in life and in death heerein is that ioy of christ which neuer can be taken from vs ioh we cannot doe the diuell a greater pleasure then to neglect the getting of this assurance for heereupon he will take occasion specially in time of distresse fearefully amp dangerously to seeke to breake the necke of our soules he cares not much otherwaies what man professe and what knowledge and other common giftes of the spirit they haue so that they want this blessed assurance and therefore with the apostle paul we must account all other things to be but drosse and dung in respect of this excellent knowledge of christ to be our sauiour and redeemer true it is that vnto many this exhortation will seeme needlesse for ignorant persons that haue nothing in them but meere presumption will bragge most of this perswasion but they that haue felt the smart of temptation doe know what it is that will stand vs in stead euen that assurance only which is rightly founded vpon the word of god and therefore forsaking the vaine conceits of our ignorance let vs with all diligence vnfeinedly endeuour to get this resolution if we cannot of our selues attaine vnto it we must vse the direction and helpe of god faithfull ministers for howsoeuer it pleaseth some to thinke otherwise yet this is the vndoubted truth of god that a man in this life may ordinarilie be resolued and assured of his saluation the second thing which the diuel aimed at in this temptation was to bring christ to a practise of vnbeleefe namely in want of bread to turne stones into bread for the present satisfying of his hunger for the diuell would needs perswade our sauior christ that he must haue bread to saue his life and therefore in the want of bread would haue brought him to this distrustfull course to turne stones into bread and as the diuell heere deales with christ so he assaies to doe with all his members as he labors to worke vnbeliefe in their hearts so he seeks to bring them to the practise of vnbeliefe in their liues see the truth hereof in the course of the world is a man oppressed with outward want and pouertie the diuell will tell him he must needs liue and therefore will perswade him to robbe and steale and to filch for his liuing if a man be sicke and want present helpe in lawful meanes or els be afflicted somewhat extraordinarily then will the diuell mooue him to seeke to wizards and witches suggesting this into him by one meanes or other that they can do more good in such a case then all the physicians in the world this is a most vile practise of vnbeliefe and yet too common in the world wherein man for the remoouall of some outward euill will not sticke to hazzard the losse of their soules we therefore must labour to be acquainted with these wiles of satan and by the practise of faith in our liues labour to expresse the power of faith in our hearts as in all manner of godly conuersation so especially in vsing only lawful meanes for our reliefe in the time of miserie and distresse but to come more particularly to the words of this temptation if thou be the son of god command these stones ampc it may be demaunded why the diuell should make choise of this question wherewith to tempt our sauiour christ rather then any other answer the reasons heereof may be these first he knew well that if christ were the true and proper son of god then he must needs be the true messias and if he were that anointed of god then also he it was that must accomplish that old and ancient promise made to our first parents gen for the bruising of the serpents head this was the thing that of all other the diuell was most afrayed of and could not endure to heare and therefore by mouing this question he intends to infringe yes and if he could quite to ouerthrow our sauiour christ in the right of this title secondly the diuell since his fall beares an vnspeakable deadly hatred against god himselfe and according to his nature as occasion serues he cannot but shew the same now in this question hee doth notably bewray his malice and spite against god for wheras in christs baptisme a little before god had proclaimed him to be his beloued son in whom hee was well pleased hereby the diuell goes about to proue the cleane contrary and so as much as in him lieth seekes to make god a lier which because it fitted his nature so well he makes choise of at this time the vse i in this practise of the diuel we may learne what to iudge of sundrie false teachers for as well in the primitiue church as also since that time there haue beene sundry man of great same for wisdome and learning as ebion cerinthus carpoorates samosatenus and arrius who haue all laboured seuerally to prooue that iesus christ the son of marie was not indeed the son of god verie god but onely a woorthie prophet now of them we may safely thinke with the church of god in former times that they were false prophets heretikes and seducers yes the professed enemy of christ guided by the spirit of satan for heerein they doe directly tread in his steps ii in this his practise we may obserue the malicious and contradicting spirit of satan against god himselfe for heere he labours to conclude that christ was not the son of god notwithstanding god himselfe had a little before auouched that he was and this is his continued practise vnto this day for where god in his church pronounceth grace mercie and loue there on the contrarie will the diuell pronounce a curse hatred and damnation againe where god denounceth his curse and iudgement there will the diuell seeke to perswade a conceit of grace and fauour if a man be the childe of god and haue receiued the seale of grace for his assurance thereof the diuell will seeke to weaken this assurance and perswade him if he can that he is the childe of wrath and if a man be voide of grace and so indeed the childe of the diuell then will satan suggest into his heart presumptuous thoughts and make him thinke he is the childe of god so that euerie way hee shewes himselfe contrarie to god yet marke the diuels words a litle further if thou be the son of god command these stones ampc that is doe but say the word and bid these stones to become bread and it will be done and here in the very propounding of this temptation we may obserue the deepe policie of satan for in these few words the better to effect his purpose he coucheth three most true and notable points in diuinitie first that he that is the son of god by nature is also true and verie god for heere he ascribeth vnto the son of god the true prerogatiue of god himselfe a point wherin the pharisees withstood our sauiour christ and which many heritikes since haue denied secondly that the true god can without paine or labour yes without all meanes at his verie becke doe whatsoeuer hee will and by his word only make stones become bread thirdly that to worke a miracle of himselfe is a property and prerogatiue of him alone that is true god as to turne stones into bread in this place now when the diuell acknowledgeth all this a man would not thinke that herein he should intend any hurt to christ or to his church but in very trueth his drift heerein is to destroie the faith of christ in that word of his father which spake from heauen and to ouerthrow the foundation of the church by proouing that iesus christ the son of marie was not true god heere then obserue a tricke of the diuels cunning when he speaks a truth he doth it not to confirme the same as louing it but indeed his meaning is to ouerthrow the truth therby which must admonish vs that when satan shall any way assault vs in temptation wee neuer giue credit vnto him no not then when he speaketh the trueth because therein his purpose is to deceiue vs and to destroy the truth hence it was that christ forbad the vncleane mark spirits to testifie of him though they acknowledged him to be the holy one of god hence also paul was grieued at the testimony of the foule spirit that was in the maid though in it selfe a most worthy truth to wit act that they were the servant of the most high god which shewed vnto me the way of saluation further in comparing our euangelist matthew with s luke there may seeme some difference between them in propounding this temptation for in matthew the words are thus command these stones ampc and in luke luke thus command this stone but they are reconciled thus matthew sets downe this temptation as the diuell first propounded it and s luke shewes how the diuell vrged it for first the diuel comes to christ and bids him if he be the son of god command all the stones which he saw round about him to be made bread this s matthew sets downe or if that seemed too much command one stone to be made bread and it should suffice and this s luke noteth the vse by this comparing of the euangelists we may obserue that when the diuell hath once begun to tempt a man he will not easily leaue off but will set an edge vpon it and enforce and vrge it by all the meanes he can that if it be possible it may preuaile which should teach vs on the other side to be most earnest and resolute in resisting satans temptations he will take small aduantage before he leaue we therefore must not ephesian giue place nor yeeld one iot vnto him iam resist the diuell and he will flie this must euery member of the church do the minister by sound and through applying of euery part of god truth to the heart whereby it may be armed against the enemie and the people by faithfull embracing and obeying of the same as also by earnest praier vnto god for the assistance of his grace in all assaults but he answering said it is written deutr man shall not liue by bread only but by euery word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god these words conteine christs gratious answer whereby he repelled the diuels temptation and in it we may obserue three points first that christ did answer secondly whence he borrowed his answer thirdly the very words of his answer for the first that christ did answer is noted by the holy ghost in plaine words and iesus answering said wherby he would giue vs to vnderstand that christ iesus our sauiour being in the wildernesse was not onely willing and ready to encounter with satan but also able to withstand him yes and to vanquish satan without receiuing any foile at his hands which is a point of singular comfort to god church and children for was christ iesus able in this low and base estate of a servant being disaduantaged also by a desert place and bodily hunger was he then i say able to encounter with satan and to ouercome him in his most violent and subtile assaults then how much more is he now able euen in all his members to giue satan the foile hauing spoiled him in his death seeing he is aduanced to the throne of maiestie and glorie and set at the right hand of his father hauing a name aboue all names giuen vnto him at which euery knee should bow both of things in heauen and in the earth and vnder the earth we therfore may now say with that lowd voice reu now is saluation in heauen and strength and power and the kingdome of our god and the power of his christ for the accuser of the brother is cast downe the second point heere noted is whence christ borroweth his answer namely from the scriptures it is written it had beene an easie thing for christ being the son of god to haue confouded the tempter with the breath of his mouth or to haue commanded innumerable legions of holy angels to haue driuen him away but he betakes himselfe to the written word for his defence and this he did especially for our instruction namely that we might know that the written word of god rightly welded by the hand of faith is the most sufficient weapon for the repelling of satan and the vanquishing of him in all his temptations hence paul calleth it ephesian the sword of the spirit because it serues not onely for our defence but also to wound satan and to put him to flight the vse i this fact of christ doth discouer and condemne the damnable practise of the church of rome who locke vp the word of god from their people in an vnknowen tongue and commend vnto them for their defence against spirituall enemy other deuices of their owne as holy water crossing crosses ampc which they highly commend as meanes of speciall strength and force to vanquish the diuell when as indeed the word of god is the onely true and trustie weapon whereof while they depriue their people they send them forth naked and vnarmed to encounter with satan secondly heere also behold the miserable estate of all those that either through couetousnesse or any other profanenesse are drawen to neglect or contemne the written word of god their case is most fearefull for they cast away those weapons whereby they should defend themselues against the diuell and quench all his firie darts and so betray their owne soules into his hands and doubtlesse all contemners and neglecters of the word are guilty of their own damnation because god hath giuen vs his word for our defence and for the confounding of satan so as without guilt of wilfull murther not of our body but of our soules we cannot neglect this heauenly weapon thirdly heerby we may see the cause why sinne so much abounds in all estates euery where namely the want of loue vnto amp knowledge in the word of god whereupon the most are ignorant of it or else know not how to handle this spirituall weapon whereby satan is resisted and foiled hosea the lord complaineth of lying swearing killing stealing and whoring yes of bloud touching bloud and the cause is laid downe in the first verse there is no knowledge of god in the land this dauid knew well and therefore said he hid god saying in his heart that he might not sinne against him psalm for as sauls speare stood in readinesse at his head euen when he slept so should god word which is the sword of the spirit be euer in our hearts as it were ready drawen that to what sinne soeuer the diuell allures vs we may be able to say for our defence it is written through want hereof it comes to passe that the diuell at his pleasure leads man captiues into all impieties lastly this excellent vse of the word vnderstood beleeued and obeied must moue all ignorant persons to labour for knowledge heerein and with all endeuor after growth in knowledge by holy obedience to shew foorth their faith if we had an enemy that had sworne our death and vowed to see our bloud how carefull would we be for our naturall life both to get vs weapons and also some knowledge to vse the same not only for our defence but also for the annoyance of our deadly foe oh then how carefull should we be for the safetie of our soules to put vpon vs the whole armour of god and to learne to vse aright this sword of the spirit that when we meet with satan our irreconciliable enemy in the field of temptation which is this miserable world we may be able both to award his blowes and to wound his head it is lamentable to see how ignorant people will blesse themselues in their ignorance and say they defie the diuell and spit at him in defiance and yet they know not how they are intangled in his snares of their owne sinnes he little regards such defiance so long as their soules lie naked and bare before his deadly darts let two man meet that be at enmity the one armed the other naked what will it auaile for the naked man to defie his enemie with bigge words while in the meane time his armed enemy takes away his life lo satan is this strong man armed and ignorant persons are poore naked ca ffes they defie the diuell and spit at him with their mouth but in the meane time the diuel wouds their soules vnto death they wil say they feele no such wounds and therefore they feare him not but they must know that the lesse they feele the more cause they haue to feare for satans wounds are most deadly when they are least felt the third point is christs answer it selfe man shall not liue by bread onely but by euery word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god this answer is borrowed from deuteron and it is that lesson which moses sought to teach the children of israell after the lord had fedde them with food from heauen in that barren wildernesse where they were afflicted with hunger the words are something hard and therefore i will shew the meaning of them man shall not liue that is shall not preserue his temporall life in this world for of eternall life neither moses nor christ did intend to speake by bread only that is onely by such ordinary meanes as food and raiment sleepe physicke ampc which god hath appointed in his prouidence for the ordinary preseruation of natural life but by euery word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god this title word betokens diverse things in scripture i the substantiall word of god the second person in trinity ioh in the beginning was the word and the word was god ii it is vsually taken for the written word conteined in the bookes of the olde and new testament pet thirdly it is sometime taken for god will and decree and it is called his good pleasure so heb christ sustaineth all things by the word of his power that is according to his will and decree by his powerfull appointment and by this word were all things made in the beginning and heerby haue they been preserued euer since this is that word that melteth the ice psalm and in this last sense must we vnderstand word in this place meaning that man doth not preserue this naturall life by ordinarie meanes onely but withall by god good pleasure will and decree sanctifying the meanes for his good note further that it is said by euery word and therein lieth the substance of this sentence for the vnderstanding whereof wee must know that this powerfull amp working word of god may be distinguished according to the matter whereabout it is occupied thus sometime god will haue man to liue by bread the ordinary food of naturall life and this is his ordinary word sometime his will and appointment is that man shall liue by extraordinarie meanes as the israelites did in the wildernesse while they liued vpon mannah and this is his extraordinary word otherwhiles hee ordaines that man shall liue without all meanes as moses did in mount sina elijah in mount horeb and our sauiour christ in this wildernesse for the space of fortie daies and fortie nights together and lastly he ordains sometime that man shall liue against meanes and contrary to the course of nature thus daniell liued in the lions denne and the three children in the firy furnace both which last may be called god miraculous word so that wee see good reason of this clause euery for heereby we learne that man doth not preserue his life only by ordinary means ordained of god but likewise by euerie word proceeding out of the mouth of god that is by euery appointment and decree of god whether extraordinary aboue the vsuall meanes or miraculous without all means or against the course of nature this we must labour to know and be perswaded of nature teacheth that man liueth by god blessing and appointment in ordinary meanes but nature knowes not this that god preserueth mans life by his worde aboue meanes without meanes yes amp against meanes the beleeuing hart will hardly yeeld to this which moses would teach the israelites and therefore wee must take the more paines to be resolued of it if any shall thinke hereupon that a man may liue by the written word without meat and drinke he is deceiued for christ meaneth not that euery word that god hath spoken shall preserue naturall life but that whatsoeuer way he hath appointed whereby man shal liue whether by ordinary or extraordinary meanes whether without meanes or against meanes the same shall be effectuall for mans preseruation thus much for the meaning the applying of this testimony to the diuels temptation is thus to be conceiued the diuels temptation was this if thou be the son of god then commaund these stones to be made bread but thou canst not make these stones to become bread therefore thou article not the son of god to this christ answers by denying the proposition or first part of this argument the ground whereof was this which the diuell tooke for granted that when a man is hungry hee must needs haue bread or else he cannot liue and this our sauiour christ doth flatly deny saying man liueth not by bread only but by euery word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god and this application is most excellent teaching vs that thing for the learning whereof the israelites were trained vp forty yeares in the wildernesse and fedde with mannah from heauen and with water out of the rock to wit that god by his word can preserue the life of man without ordinarie meanes euen what way soeuer hee appointeth for that purpose and if wee should spend our liues in learning heerof no doubt the time were not mispent the vse first heereby we are taught to consider aright of all creatures whereby our life is preserued as meat drinke apparell ampc and that is thus besides the bodily sustenance of the creature we must labour to see a further matter euen the blessing of god in the creature proceeding from his word decree and appointment whereby it is made fit and able to yeeld sustenance and nourishment the scripture calleth this the leuit staffe of bread and so it is indeed for as an aged and impotent man falleth to the ground if his staffe be plucked from him so the best creature that serues for our vse without god blessing becomes fruitlesse vnto vs this reason may teach vs for how should that thing of it selfe preserue and further life which in it selfe is void of life and how should that giue heat and warmnesse to our body which of it selfe is void of heate let vs therefore confesse that it is not the substance of foode that doth refresh vs nor the matter of our raiment that keeps vs warme but the blessing of him that by his word hath ordained them for these ends if he withdraw his blessing the staffe and isai stay is gone man may eat as haggai hag saith but they shal not haue enough they may drinke and yet not be filled they may cloth themselues and not be warme it is god blessing that makes god creatures do vs good how else should it come to passe that the poore mans child which is barely clad and homely fed should be as healthfull comely and well liking as the child of a prince but that god blesseth aswell the homely food of the poore as the dainty fare of the richest secondly heereby wee must learne sobriety and temperance in the vse of all god creatures when we vse our food and raiment it is god blessing alone that makes them do vs good the lord as it were stands by vs to put his blessing vpon euery morsell that we eat and euery draught that we drinke and vpon our raiment when we put it on how then dare wee abuse them in surfetting and drunkennesse in pride and wantonnesse may we not feare in so doing that while the meate or drinke is in our mouthes the wrath of god will fall vpon vs as psalm thirdly hence wee must learne to sanctifie god creatures as food and raiment which we vse for our comfort by inuocation on the name of god for we doe not liue by the creatures simply but by the word and appointment of god blessing them vnto vs and therefore we must not be like vnto brute beastes which receiue god blessings but yet neuer looke vp to heauen from whence they come or like to the swine that gathereth vp the mast not looking vp to the tree from which it falleth fourthly heerby we see the common errour of the world who place the staffe and stay of their life in the abundance of outward blessings whereupon they labour to inrich themselues heerewith as much as possibly they can these man do litle consider that mans life standeth not in abudance neither doth he liue by bread but by the blessing of god which is and may be as well vpon a little as vpon the treasures of a kingdome this was the practise of the rich foole luke who spake peace to his soule for ease and pastime because he had much goods laide vp for many yeares but since christ teacheth vs that man liueth not by bread only it must needs be a flat note of vnbeliefe to carke and care immoderately for the things of this life fiftly heereby wee are also taught not to entangle our selues ouermuch with the cares of this world nor to suffer our harts to be oppressed with desire of food raiment lands or liuing because our life and welfare consisteth not in these things but in the blessing of god on whatsoeuer he sends be it more or lesse the gripple mind after much is a deadly tim snare wherewith many a soule is intangled to perdition and destruction this choakes the heart in such sort as the seed of grace can take no root not bring foorth any sauing fruite this made paul to lay a charge vpon timothy for rich man that they should trust in the liuing god and not in vncertaine riches tim let vs therefore be content with food and raiment and rather seeke the kingdome of god and his righteousnesse and then all those things whereof we stand in need shall be giuen vnto vs in the moderate vse of lawful meanes indeed the worldlings excuse is that food and raiment is his liuing which he must needs looke vnto but we must still remember that our life standeth not in these things for when death comes these cannot saue vs from the graue it is god blessing by which we liue hee can preserue vs aboue meanes nay without meanes and against meanes and therefore wee must neuer giue place to such thoughts and cares as shew distrust in god sixthly hence wee must learne contentation and patience in extreame pouerty and in all other miseries of this life if god should deale with vs as hee did with his servant iob if for our religion hee should bring vpon vs the losse of goods of children of health and all that we haue with banishment also from our friends and country yet then must we labour to shew the fruit of patience and not suffer our harts to be swallowed vp of ouermuch griefe because our life stands by god word and not in any of these things indeed if in these outward miseries a man should be depriued of the comfort of god prouidence then might he sorrow without measure but seeing all such as feare god doe still enioy the blessing of god in their greatest calamities for god blessing is not locked vp in bread but aboue means without meanes and against meanes can he manifest his power and goodnesse in their preseruation therefore in the extremity of evil must wee comfort our selues in the lord our god as sam dauid did in great sorrow hauing lost his two wiues and being in danger to be stoned of his owne followers and learne to say with iob iob though the lord kill me yet will i trust in him what if the lord should send a famine among vs as he may iustly do for the sinnes of this land should we then despaire or vse vnlawful meanes for our reliefe nay then we must learne moses lesson that man liueth not by bread only and labour to depend on him that can increase king the oile in the poore widowes cruise and the meale in the barrels till plenty come seuenthly this must teach vs moderation of our affections in all estates that do befall vs in health and plenty wee must not be puffed vp with pride in weakenesse and in want wee must not be oppressed with sorrow for mans life standeth not in these things neither can we heereby know loue or hatred he that is in want may haue as good a portion in god blessing as the wealthiest in the world heerein luke hungry lazarus full of fores went farre beyond the rich glutton in all his riot lastly seeing our life depends vpon god word we must heereby learne to acknowledge god prouidence and to rely thereupon in all estates in the daies of peace wherein as iob iob speaketh of himselfe man wash their paths in butter and haue the rockes to powre them out river of oile man will soone be brought to say so much but we must labour to see and feele the blessing of his prouidence euen then when we tread as it were the winepresse of his wrath as well in sicknesse as in health in want as in plenty in the depth of distresse as in the height of all prospetity this is the counsell of the holy ghost prou rolle thy workes vpon the lord cast all your care vpon him for he careth for you pet it is a brutish property only to looke vpon the creatures whereon they feed and therefore our eies and our hearts must be fixed on him who feedeth the yong rauens that crie vnto him and beareth vp all things by his mighty word wee must not content our selues with a bare speculation heereof in our heads but labour to feele the comfort of it in our hearts and to expresse the power of it in our liues and thus much for the first conflict then the diuell tooke him vp into the holy city and set him on a pinnacle of the temple and said vnto him if thou be the son of god cast thy selfe down a for it is ps written that he will giue his angels charge ouer thee and with their hands they shall lift thee vp lest at any time thou shouldst dash thy foot against a stone iesus said vnto him it is deut written againe thou shalt not tempt the lord thy god these words containe the second conflict of satan with our sauiour christ for howsoeuer by saint luke this is put in the third place which matthew heere placeth in the second yet this breedeth no difference betweene the euangelists who tie not themselues to a strict obseruation of time place and order how euery thing was done which they relate as in the story of this conflict saint luke respects the substance of it onely but s matthew obserues the order of it also now in this second conflict we are to obserue three points i satans preparation thereto ii the assault it selfe iii christs answer and repulse thereof i point satans preparation to this conflict is conteined in the verse wherein we are to note both the time and the parts thereof the time in the first word then that is so soone as the diuell had receiued a foile of christ in his first assault presently hee addresseth himselfe vnto a second heerein behold the exceeding malice of satan in that the end of one temptation with him is but the beginning of another he ceaseth not with one assault but as hee is a deadly foe to the church of god so he shewes himselfe by his continuall seeking whom he may deuour he will neuer make truice with any child of god vpon any condition lesse than the hazard of his soule neither is he weary of his worke but day and night is either plotting or performing some mischieuous attempt against the child of god the consideration whereof must teach vs vpon our victorie and conquest ouer one temptation presently to prepare for a new this was the state of the son of god our head and we his members may not looke for better our life in this vale of teares is a continuall warfare against the enemy of our soules we must not therfore heere looke for rest and ease but euer keepe watch and ward against their assaults if this duty were well learned and put in practise it would preuent much impatience amp become the ground of much peace in our soules mans nature cannot brooke the doubling and renuing of sorrowes when one euill lights in the necke of another oh then hee thinketh neuer any was in his case but looke vnto iesus the author and finisher of thy faith he endured no lesse and heerein he is an example that thou shouldest follow his steps if therefore thou wilt be his disciple prepare to take vp thy crosse luke euery day and follow him the parts of satans preparation are two first he conuaies christ from ierusalem to the wildernesse secondly hee placeth him on a pinnacle of the temple for the first in these words the diuell tooke him vp into the holy city that is into ierusalem as luke expoundeth it chap this the diuell might doe three waies in vision or leading him vp the ordinary way or carrying him through the aire i it might be in vision for that was vsuall with the prophets so ier ieremie went to the riuen perath and ezekiel was carried from mesopotamia to ezek ierusalem but christ was not thus transported for then satans perswasion vnto christ to cast himselfe downe could haue beene no temptation ii christ might bee led of the diuell the ordinary way from the wildernesse to ierusalem so much the words will beare but as i take it he went not so for if christ were ledde by the diuell it was either willingly of his owne accord or by the diuels perswasion but of his owne accord he would not goe for hee came into the wildernesse to bee tempted which as yet was not fully accomplished and therefore would not willingly depart thence before that worke for which he came were ended againe he would not depart thence vpon the diuels perswasion for christ would neuer gratifie the diuell so much as to do ought himselfe which the diuell would haue him as in all his temptations doth appeare for this is a rule to be obserued we must not do any thing which the diuell perswades vs to in his temptations though in it selfe the thing be lawful and good iii the diuell might carry the body of our sauiour christ thorow the aire by his power through god permission this is the most likely way amp so thought to be of the best diuines and the words following confirme it much for it is said the diuell set him on a pinnacle of the temple now if hee had power to set him there why might hee not also cary him thither god ordaining this as well as his temptation the vse by this we see that man may be transported by the diuell from place to place as the records of all ages do report this one thing yet obserued wherin the common opinion faileth that the diuell cannot conuey a man aliue so far in a little time as many man thinke as a thousand or two thousand miles in an houre for no man is able to endure such violent motion and yet liue as experience teacheth let a man fall from some high steeple and his breath wilbe gone and hee dead before hee come at the ground by reason of the violence of his motion indeed the diuell can carrie a man very swiftly but yet for the safetie of mans life he must prolong his time far more than otherwise of himselfe hee needs to doe secondly hence wee learne that by god permission the diuell may haue power ouer the body of god owne children which are true beleeuers to transport them from place to place for dealing thus with the head christ iesus why may hee not doe so with any of his members besides we find that god permitting him hee hath done more than this to the saints of god hee may possesse their body as he did the woman of canaans daughter mat he may torment them long as hee did exceeding grieuously bow the body of a daughter of abraham eighteen years luke yes he may kill the body as he did to iobs children who no doubt were holy persons iob and therefore much more may hee transport them from place to place heere this question may fitly be answered whether a true beleeuer may be bewitched answer hee may there is none vpon earth so faithfull and holy but if god permit satan can afflict their body grieuously and therefore also they may be bewitched it is but the fancy of presumptuous persons when they say their faith is so strong that all the witches in the world cannot hurt them for if god permit satan can grieuously afflict mans body as he did the body of iob yes he can kil the body as hath been shewed salomon speaking of outward things saith truly ecclesiastes all things come alike to all and the same condition is to the iust and to the wicked now the wicked man may be bewitched as al will grant why then may not the godly also seeing it is but an outward euill this therfore must abate their pride that stand so much on their strong faith behold this fact of satan to the holy body of christ and heereby learne for thy humiliation that if god permit satan is able to bring vpon thy body great affliction further obserue the place whither satan caries our sauiour christ into the holy city that is ierusalem quest why is it called holy seeing now it was a polluted place full of sinful people answer it is called holy for these causes because heere was the lord temple the place of his solemne worship wherein were the holy rites and ceremonies prescribed for god worship secondly in ierusalem as also in all the synagogues of iudea was moses chaire the law and the prophets were read amp expounded thirdlie ierusalem was the mother city of all the world in respect of religion heere god ordained that his church should first be planted and from hence must religion bee deriued to other nation the vse hence we may obserue that at this time ierusale was the true church of god indeed it was very corrupt both for doctrine and maners as christs seuere reproofe of both doth plainely shew mat ampc and mat ampc and yet a true church else the holy ghost would not haue called it the holy city now if ierusalem at this time were the true church of god then then may wee well say that in england god hath his true church for let the corruptions of our church bee as they are yet shall it match ierusalem in the prerogatiues of god church they had the law and the prophets read and expounded so haue wee and the gospel also which is the power of god to mans saluation they had the sacraments and ceremonies of the law answerable thereto wee haue the sacraments of the gospell and also a true and holy forme of seruing god their ierusalem was a mother city and though wee cannot say so much in that behalfe yet hath our church beene a nurce to neighbour churches in germany france and other places round about for many yeares in regard whereof the lord no doubt hath bestowed many blessings vpon vs and therefore though our sinnes and abuses be many and grieuous yet in regard of church prerogatiues we may be called a holy nation and a true member of the church of god so that as our sauiour christ and his disciples ioined themselues to the congregations of the iewes in their legal seruice and forsooke them not till they became no church so ought it to be among vs till we separate from christ none should seuer themselues from our church ministery amp seruice of god those therefore that make a separation from our church because of corruptions in it are farre from the spirit of christ and his apostles if any shal say this makes wel for the church of rome if so corrupt a place as ierusalem in regard of church prerogatiues were an holie city for they haue as many prerogatiues for religion as the iewes then had and therefore are the church of god and so we do not well to separate from them answer some indeed that are no papists say the church of rome is the church of god but the truth is the present church of rome is spirituall babylon the mother of abhominations no spouse of christ but a strumpet but they plead their prerogatiues as first their succession from peter secondly true baptisme for substace according to the first institution thirdly the apostles creed which they hold and beleeue fourthly the word of god in the writings of the prophets amp apostles and lastly that theirs is the mother church answer all this is nothing when the truth appeares for first succession in person without succession in doctrine is no note of a church now let them shew succession in the apostles doctrine and we yeeld secondly their baptisme alone though for substance true baptisme cannot prooue them a true church circumcision was the sacrament of god church yet samaria and colchis were not the church of god though they vsed it againe the thiefe may shew the true mans purse but that proueth him not to be true and honest no more doth baptisme iustifie the church of rome to bee a true church lastly though they haue outward baptism yet indeed they ouerthrow inward baptisme the life of that sacrament to wit imputed righteousnesse and renued holinesse which in god church must goe together with the outward element else it is nothing thirdly for the apostles creed they haue it in word but they deny it in deede for though they say they beleeue in god the father and in iesus christ yet in effect they deny both god and christ for the god of the papists is an idol god and the christ of the papists a false christ as we haue shewed in handling of the creed fourthly for the scripture wee must know the word of god stands not in bare words and letters but in the true sense and meaning of the holy ghost contained in the scriptures of the prophets and apostles now though they haue the bookes of scripture yet in sundry main grounds of religion they ouerthrow the foundation of the prophets and apostles again they keep the scripture as a lantern holds a candle not for it selfe but for passengers so is the scripture with them not for their synagogue but for god secret ones among them for euen in the midst of popery hath god euer had some of his elect who haue not embraced their cursed doctrine lastly for their plea to be the mother church we must distinguish between the ancient church of rome and the strumpet that now is the ancient church of rome to whom paul writ was a true and famous church and a mother church but she is now dead and buried and the now roman church is no mother church no spouse of christ but the whore of babel the mother of abhominations from which we are commanded to depart reuelat secondly in that christ is brought to ierusale that holy city there to be tempted wee learne that no holinesse of place on earth can debarre the diuell from his temptations he brings christ from the wildernesse to tempt him in the holy city euen vpon the holy temple hee will thrust himselfe zak on iehoshuahs right hand to resist him though iehoshuah stand before the angell of the lord to minister to the lord and therefore the follie of papists is egregious that thinke the signe of the crosse holy water reliques and such massing inchantments haue vertue in them to free their houses or their body fro the assaults of satan lastly heereby wee see that change of place is but a sillie cure for a troubled mind indeed change of aire may much further bodily cures but a troubled mind hath conflicts with the diuel who will not leaue for change of place ierusalem will fit his turne as well as the wildernesse the second part of the diuels preparation to this conflict is this and set him on a pinnacle of the temple the word translated pinnacle signifieth properly a wing of the temple whereby some take to be meant the sharpe brouches and spires on the top of the temple whereof there were diverse but these as i take it are not heere meant for such a spire cannot wel be called a wing others take it for some part of the battlement made on the top of the temple which was flat as the iewes vsed to build to keepe man from falling others take it for any top corner of the temples and whether of these it was we cannot certainly define but this we must holde that it was some dangerous steepe downe place on some corner of the temple or on the battlements from which a man might easily cast himselfe whereby we see the diuell will omit no aduantage that may further his temptations which should make vs the more carefull of our standing against him and said vnto him if thou be the son of god cast thy selfe downe for it is written that he wil giue his angels charge ouer thee and with their hands they shall lift thee vp lest at any time thou shouldst dash thy foot against a stone these wordes containe the second maine point in this conflict to wit satans assault vpon christ wherein we are to obserue first his temptation then the reason whereby he doth enforce it his temptation heere is framed as the former was in a kind of reasoning thus if thou be the son of god then shew the same by casting thy selfe downe from this pinnacle of the temple but as i see thou article certainly perswaded that thou article the son of god therefore cast thy selfe downe and thereby declare it if thou be the son of god then shew the same by casting thy selfe downe from this pinnacle of the temple but as i see thou article certainly perswaded that thou article the son of god therefore cast thy selfe downe and thereby declare it seeing this is a distinct temptation from the former i doubt not but it must be thus framed with this conclusion for if it had the same conclusion with the former it should be the same temptation satans meaning then is this as if he had said i haue made triall to see expresly whether thou be the son of god or not and it seemes thou doest vndoubtedly beleeue that voice of thy father to be true which said this is my welbeloued son in whom i am wel pleased now if this be so indeed it is conuenient thou shouldest confirme the same by some miracle and the fittest place thou canst doe it in is this therefore cast thy selfe downe headlong from this pinnacle and yet preserue thy selfe in safety without all hurt in the fall the drift of satan in this temptation was to bring our sauior christ to a vaine confidence in his fathers protection and indeed to flat presumption vpon his extraordinarie prouidence in the neglect of lawful ordinary means as by satans conclusion amp the answer of christ will easily appeare and hereby we may obserue that one maine drift of satan in his ordinarie temptations in god church is to carry man to presumption and vaine confidence in the loue fauor and mercy of god this appeares by the strange reasonings for libertie in sinne which many frame to themselues and some are not ashamed to vtter as first god is mercifull and christ shedde his bloud for their redemption and therefore they will not be so strict and precise in hearing sermons and reading amp conferring about the word as many are but they wil take the pleasures and seeke the profit of this life thus reasoned some in the apostles daies rom let vs continue in sin that grace may abound of such iude complaineth saying iude they turne the grace of god into wantonnesse such there haue beene euer since amp at this day they doe euerie where abound secondly some say they are either ordained to saluation or damnation now if to saluation they are sure of it how euer they liue and if to damnation they cannot escape it though they liue neuer so holily for god decree is vnchangeable and therfore they will take their pleasure and liue as they list thirdly others say they haue euer found god goodnesse towards them and they are perswaded he will neuer see them want and therefore they will not toile themselues with labor amp care as others do but take their ease and pleasure while they may haue it and so neglect their charge and calling and giue themselues wholly to their sports and pleasures to company keeping or such like yes by this temptation to presumption satan oft preuailes with the better sort for if a man fauour the trueth and giue himselfe to know religion in any sort the diuell will straight way go about to perswade him that that which he doth is sufficient to his saluation amp thus wil keepe him from vsing further means to come by the certaine knowledge of his election and full affiance in christ iesus to become a perfect man in christ which is the end of god holy ministery ephesian whereunto we should giue all diligence pet see the truth heereof in the fine foolish virgin who carried m tth ampc burning lamps but tooke no oile with them neuer minding that till it was too late and so doe most man content themselues with the blazing lampe of an outward profession neuer looking for the oile of grace till the time of grace he past the vse heereby then wee are all taught in speciall maner to beware of presumption this is the common snare of the diuel wherein he intangles many a soule it is true indeed that he oft preuailes by bringing man to desperation but a thousand perish through presumption almost for one by desperation for despaire is a painfull thing to flesh and bloud and as the diuell knowes well doth sometimes turne to a mans more sound conuersion but to presume is sweet and pleasant to the flesh and most agreeable to mans corrupt nature in regard whereof wee ought to keepe out heart with all watch amp ward as dauid praieth keepe thy servant from presumptuous sinnes ps againe obserue the order of satans temptations by comparing this with the former there he sought to ouerthrow christs faith amp to bring him to distrust the trueth of god word vttered from heauen but finding hee could not that way preuaile heere he takes the cleane contrary course and seekes to bring him to presume this serues to discouer vnto vs the deepe guile and subtilty of the diuell that can so cunningly turn himselfe from one extreame vnto another and looke as he dealeth here with christ the head so doth hee continue towards all his members if he cannot bring them to one extreame he will assay them hard in the other if hee cannot bring a man to couetousnesse and keepe his heart to the loue of money then let him beware of riot and prodigality is a man giuen to pleasures and delight and an length is depriued of them then let him beware the diuell swallow him not vp with ouermuch griefe as he sought to do with the corinthian incestuous person of corinthian doth a man come to loue religion that formerly was giuen to loosenesse of life then if it be possible the diuell will carrie him to schisme amp heresie the diuel cannot abide that a man should keepe the meane according to god word isay he would haue our first parents to be god or no body gene and so still he laboureth to bring a man to some extreame we therefore in all estates during life must labour to keepe the golden meane as christ heere did neither doubting on the one hand nor presuming on the other but retaining still that blessed faith whereby his blessed heart was firmly setled in these assaults thus much for satans drift now come to the words of this temptation if thou be the son of god then cast thy selfe downe that is shew by this miracle that thou article the son of god marke here the diuell perswades him not to shew himselfe to be the son of god by doctrine in the execution of his ministerie but cast thy selfe downe shew a miracle wherein we may beholde the very liuely image of that naturall disposition which is in all impenitent persons they affect christes miracles but they care not for his doctrine herod longed to see christ luke and was glad of his comming when pilate sent him yet not to heare his doctrine for that he could not endure els he would not haue imprisoned john and also put him to death but he hoped to see a miracle the wicked iewes desire a signe that put christ to death for his doctrine yet if be will come downe from the crosse and so miraculously saue himselfe then they will beleeue mark and this venom of the olde serpent hath poisoned the hearts of many students in the scriptures who care not at all to ground themselues in the fundamentall points of religion as faith and repentance and yet are woonderfull eager after quidditles and difficulty wherein may appeare some outward shew of wit and learning like the hypocriticall pharisies that would tithe mint and rue and yet passe ouer iudgement and the loue of god luke and the cause hereof is the want of sound grace for naturall man indeed can not sauour the things of the spirit of god the knowledge of christ crucified seemes foolishnesse vnto them secondly the diuell tooke occasion of his former temptation from christs infirmitie of hunger but perceiuing christs sure faith in his fathers word by his gratious answer to that assault heere he borrowes his temptation from that profession of his faith as if he should say thou seemest to be resolued of the trueth of thy fathers word that thou article the son of god and if that be true indeed then shew it by this miracle cast thy selfe downe heere then behold another tricke of satan if he cannot preuaile by assaults drawen from our infirmities then will he assay vs by temptations drawen from god good gifts and graces in vs if he cannot keepe a man in ignorance that hath good gifts of wit amp memory then will hee seeke from his knowledge to puffe him vp with pride and so mingling his poison with god good gifts doth cause many a one to become a bane to god church that otherwise might haue prooued an excellent instrument therein as might easily be shewed in sundry particulars thirdly heere marke how satans malice is restrained and his power limited by god permission he is able to carrie christ from the wildernes to ierusalem and there to set him in a most dangerous place on a wing of the temple the thing hee now desireth is his destruction by casting downe head long but that he can not doe and therefore perswades christ to cast himself down wherein we see the speciall prouidence of god ouer christ iesus in all these temptations restraining his enemy in the thing he most desired and the same prouidence doth he still continue ouer his church for the effectuall preseruation of christs members in all their temptations the diuels vnwearied desire amp drift is to bring contentions hurliburlies and ruines into all societies in church and commonwealth therfore the peace and tranquillity of these is and so must bee acknowledged a notable fruit of god blessed prouidence restraining the spite and malice of satan againe hence it is euident that in temptation satan cannot go beyond the permission of god he can tempt christ yes transport his body and set him in a dangerous place for thus far god permits him to goe but to cast christ downe from the pinnacle he cannot therein comes god restraint so it fareth with god children for the triall of his graces in them and to chastise them for some sinnes he suffers satan to buffet them but yet one iotte of his malice beyond god permission he cannot shew as in iobs affliction by him may notably appeare which wee must carefully remember for our special comfort in our most grieuous assaults god will permitting satan so farre must make vs patient and yet his power restraining satan from doing worse must giue vs comfort thus much for the temptation itselfe the reason whereby satan enforceth his temptation is taken from a testimony of scripture for it is written he shall giue his angels charge ouer thee ampc satan hearing christ alledge scripture for his defence against the first assault comes now vpon him with his owne weapon that if it were possible he might foile him after this sort thou shewest thy selfe to be the doctor of the church by thine alleadging of scripture and that it seemes thou makest the rule of thine actions well then thou maiest well and safely cast thy selfe downe hence if thou bee the son of god for it is written he shall giue his angels charge ouer thee and with their hands they shall lift thee vp ampc from this dealing of satan wee are taught not to embrace an opinion in religion because a shew of proofe by testimony of scripture may bee giuen for it but we must trie the spirits that is the doctrines of man whether they be of god or not ioh for the diuell can alleadge scripture to mooue christ vnto presumption and it is his vsuall practise when he caries man into schisms errors and heresies reason with a man that minds to liue in sinne and tell him of that dangerous state by reason of the shortnesse and vncertainty of this life will he not tell you straight he will doe as he does and repent when he is old for it is written ezek at what time soeuer a sinner doth repent him of his sinne i will put all his wickednesse out of my remembrance saith the lord and some thinke three or foure good words at a mans last end wil serue his turne for the thiefe on the crosse said no more but luke lord remember me when thou comest into thy kingdome and all such as are trained vp in the schoole of satan can easilie alledge scripture to further them in evil but let vs come to the scripture which the diuel doth notoriously abuse by his allegation it is written in the ps v in the alledging whereof he would seeme very carefull and precise at the first not omitting so much as this particle for which might haue beene left out and yet nothing haue been wanting to the force of his reason but heerein is the deepenesse of his policy to cause christ not to suspect any falshood afterward for towards the end hee leaueth out that on which the promise is grounded of being kept by the angel to wit to keepe thee in all thy waies that is in all the good duties of thy lawful calling wherein thou shalt glorifie god and doe good to others to such as so walke in their waies doth that promise belong heere then behold satans notable fraud and craft that can so cunninglie leaue out that which makes not for his purpose and so peruert the true meaning of scripture this is his vsuall practise in enmity against the word to depraue the true meaning by cutting off some part when hee cannot vtterly ouerthrow the whole the like is the dealing of all heretickes who by cutting off and leauing out play legerdemaine with the scripture the arrian holds the bible for the word of god but such places as serue to proue the godhead of christ he doth notably abuse and peruert the familie of loue also doth hold the bible for the word of god but come to the true meaning of it therein they faile turning all into allegories euen most true history as the fall of our first parents and such like which are maine grounds of religion in their naturall sense and the apostaticall church of rome doth hold with vs the bookes of the old and new testament but yet they put in and take out at their pleasure and take from it all sense and meaning which agrees not with the determination of their holy father the pope and thereby they ouerturne the word of god and strongly maintaine their mystery of iniquity this dealing of satan and his wicked miscreants with the scripture must make all god children willing to spend their strength in searching out the scripture for that is the onely way to descrie their fraude in deprauing of it this caused christ to bidde the people in his time to search the scriptures to learne to know him to bee the true messias which the iewish teachers did then deny in regard whereof wee must say with number moses oh that all the lord people were prophets and that the lord would put his spirit vpon them oh that all could reade and vnderstand the word of god this is it wherein all that either be or intend to be ministers must labour especially euen to get sound knowledge and iudgement in the text of scripture the minister must not only be able to teach the truth but also to discerne to discouer and to confure errors and heresies which hee can neuer foundly doe without good vnderstanding in the text it selfe the diuell knowes the whole scripture and he will spare no text therein it hee can corrupt it therfore to resoue god truth out of his hands who is the father of lies the minister must shew himselfe a good souldier of iesus christ as paul exhorteth timothy giuing such attendance to the word that all man may see his profitting therein yes with ieremie the minister must eat the bookes of god and digest them in his vnderstanding and rejoice therein labouring to feele them the joy of his heart the diuell knowes that scripture truely vnderstood and well applied is the onely engine for the battery of his kingdome and therefore euen from the beginning but specially since the comming of christ hee hath laboured by all meanes to keepe man from the knowledge and true vnderstanding of them hee it is that hath brought man from the reading of the scriptures to betake themselues to the writings of man as schoolemen fathers and such by this meanes hee hath for many yeares euen to this day in the church of rome locked vp the scripture in an vnknowen tongue yes euen in god church the diuel works mightily this way by stealing away the affections of yong students from the bible and rauishing them with delight in the writings of man for thus he keeps them from the fountaine of truth that they either fal into error themselues or be lesse able to discerne and confute it in others and hence come dissentions and errors into the schooles of the prophets which cannot be auoided while man leaue the text of scripture amp addict themselues so much to the writings of man for thereby hee can more cunningly conuey strange conceits into mens minds and therfore euery one that would maintain the truth in purity and syncerity must labour painfully in the text secondly god ministers must heereby be admonished to be carefull in alleadging any text of scripture that the same be fit and pertinent for to wrest the same from the proper meaning of the holy ghost to serue their owne conceit is the practise of satan which euery servant of god must be farre from and therefore must not do it hand ouer head which also may serue for a good aduertisement to those that vse to heape vp manifold allegations of scriptures in the doctrine of a sermon for as prou in many words there cannot want iniquity as salomo saith so in affected multiplicity of quotations can the abuse of scripture bee hardly escaped if we deliuer but a mans testimony honesty will compell vs as neere as we can to keepe both his words and his meaning much more should conscience moue vs in alledging the testimony of the lord to haue carefull respect to the euidence of truth and therfore that sparing course is very commendable whereby in quoting of scripture man make sure to keepe themselues to the lord true meaning lest by deprauing his word they become followers of satan and thus much for the maner of satans allegation the true and proper meaning of that text is now briefly to be discussed the ninety one psalme from whence it is alledged is a most heauenly part of scripture penned for the comfort of god people in the time of some grieuous plague or sickenesse and it containes a notable preseruatiue against the plague and by consequent against any iudgement of god to wit true affiance and confidence in the lord that is the ground of all comfortable safety thereto among many other is verse this gratious promise made of the protection of god holy angels which the diuell doth heere alledge who shall be as carefull for the safety of god children in common calamities of famine plague pestilence ampc as the nurce is ouer her tender child to hold it in her hands and beare it vp in her armes lest it should fall and hurt it selfe alwaies prouided that the child of god keepe himselfe in his waies that is in obedience to god commandements and in the duties of his lawful calling it is true indeed that iudgement begins at the house of god and the righteous are taken away from the euill to come yes many times the same outward iudgement lights vpon the good that doeth vpon the bad yet this taketh not from god child the comfort of this protection in common calamities for all promises of temporall blessings must be vnderstood with the exception of the crosse as heere god angels shall guard his children in time of plague famine and pestilence vnlesse it please god heerewith to chasten them for some sinne past or to preuent some sin or greater euill to come or to make triall of their faith and patience in which cases also the child of god doth greatly differ from the wicked for through the fruition of god loue in christ the euill of the punishment is taken away and the outward smart thereof see iob ps sanctified to the greater good of his soule but out of this case their protection is certaine see exod psalm amp ezek the vse the consideration of this gratious protection of god angels ouer such as keepe themselues in their waies must moue euery one to labour to know and practise the duties of his calling both generall of christianity and particular for the state of his life in all good conscience so doing let come what will in all dangers hee shall haue safety for god angels pitch their tents about him they are as watchfull ouer him as a nurce ouer her child but if wee forsake our waies wee lose the comfort of their protection amp expose our selues to all god iudgements iesus said vnto him againe it is written thou shalt not tempt the lord thy god heere is the third generall point in this conflict to wit christs answer and repulse made to satans assault taken as the diuels temptation was from a text of scripture for hee saith againe it is written where yet hee meaneth not to oppose scripture to scripture but to confute the abuse of scripture by scripture after this sort as if he had said to satan it is true indeed that god hath made many worthy promises of aid and protection to his children in his word yet they shal not be performed to those that presume to tempt god as thou wouldest haue me to do from this dealing of christ with satan we may obserue that the scriptures of god are sufficient in themselues truely to interpret and expound themselues the diuel alledging scripture did wrest it from the true sense this our sauiour christ sheweth by alledging another text out of deut moses which being applied to the place which the diuel abused doth shew the true meaning thereof so ezra expouding the law vnto the jew read distinctly in the law of god and as the words do signifie ezra gaue the sense by scripture and caused the people to vnderstand much more then at this day may the scriptures be thought sufficient for the expounding of themselues since to the canon there of since ezra his time there is added the whole new testament by the hand of god wherein the deepe things of god are plainelie reuealed the church of rome cannot away with this that scripture should be sufficient to expound it selfe and therefore against it they reason thus that which must expound scripture must haue iudiciall power to determine of the sense thereof but the scriptures haue no such ludiciall power for they are but a dumb letter and therfore no sufficient iudge to determine of their owne sense and meaning answer the scriptures haue iudiciall power to determine of their owne true sense and meaning for they speake euidently to all that are inlightned by god spirit and therby made able to know what the scripture saith wee know a man may speake to his friend not only by word of mouth but also by letter and thereby expresse his meaning sufficiently euen so though god speake not now vnto his church by created voice yet by his written word he speakes sufficiently for the cleare manifestation of his will and pleasure concerning them and therefore it is a shamefull slander and blasphemy against the scriptures to call them an inkie letter and dumbe iudge and let them shew if the scripture be not where is that speaking iudge who hath power iudiciall to expound the scripture indeed their answer is that the church is this iudge and that we must consult at her mouth for the true meaning of the scripture answer the church hath a ministery and dispensation committed vnto her in the execution whereof she deliuereth the meaning of the scripture vnto god people but that is not from any iudiciall authority committed vnto her to determine of the sense of scripture of her selfe but onely by comparing scripture with scripture and expounding one place out of another euen as the lawyer giues the sense of the law not from any iudicial power giuen vnto him aboue the law but by obseruing the words with the scope and circumstances of the law but heere i would know if the church must needs bee iudge by what meanes must she determine they answer by the rule of faith the consent of councels and fathers and if these faile then by the pope answer by their rule of faith they vnderstand vnwritten traditions that is such truth beside scripture as hath beene kept by tradition from hand to hand since the primitiue church but these are meere forgeries and shame it were to subiect the truth of god to the deuice of man if these bee made iudge of scripture then shall the faith of the church depend vpon the wisedome of man and not vpon the power of god a thing abhorred of the apostle corinthian the onely rule of faith is the scripture and true faith will admit no other iudge beside the scripture to determine of that whereon it must depend secondly for their consent of fathers and councels that is no sufficient meanes to determine of the true sense of scripture for their seuerall errors and contradictions one to another amp many times to themselues shew that they wanted the immediate assistance of the spirit and the same is true of the pope as might easily be proued at large by their grosse ignorance amp errors and therfore it remaines that the true iudge and expounder of scripture is scripture it selfe as christ himselfe by his practise sheweth in this place the place alledged by christ is this commandement of god vnto his people thou shalt not tempt the lord thy god for the vnderstanding whereof we must search out three things first what the tempting of god signifieth secondly the manner how god is tempted and thirdly the cause and root thereof for the first to tempt god signifieth to make triall and experience of god and to prooue whether hee be so true iust mercifull prouident and powerfull as his word reporteth him to be thus did the israelites often tempt god as the lord saith psalm when your fathers tempted me proued me and saw my workes which latter words shew what it is to tempt god euen to seeke to haue proofe by his works whether he be such a one as his word saith he is if any shall say we are commanded to taste and see how gratious the lord is ps yes the lord bids his people proue him malach answer those places do sufficiently expound themselues for dauids taste and sight is by the grace of true faith and affiance for in the same verse he pronounceth such blessed and in malachie the lord bids them prooue him but yet in their way of obedience in prouiding for his sanctuary according to his ordinances therefore we must know for the second point that euery triall of god is not simply euill but that which is needlesse when without warrant from his word we presume vpon him beyond the meanes of his ordinary prouidence thirdly the root of this sinne is an vnbeleeuing heart whereby a man doubts of the truth of god word of his power presence and prouidence ps the israelites tempted god in their hearts there is this sinne the maner how followeth in requiring meat for their lusts ampc not contenting theselues with god present prouidence the root amp ground whereof is set downe verse because they beleeued not in god and trusted not in his helpe when a man doubts of the fidelity of his servant he wil lay something in his way as a peece of siluer his purse ampc to trie him withall so when a man begins to doubt of god goodnesse and fidelity towards him hee will easily be brought to make needlesse triall of him by some worke of god beside his ordinary prouidence the meaning then is this thou shalt not tempt the lord thy god that is thou shalt not make any needlesse triall of god goodnesse mercy power or prouidence from a distrustfull heart in the truth of his word heere yet further for our instruction wee are to know that god is tempted fiue waies as the word of god doth manifest first when a man shall appoint vnto god either the time when the place where or the maner how god shall helpe him and performe his word vnto him heerein he seeks experience of the truth and power of god thus the israelites tempted god in the wildernesse when they wanted water saying exod is god among vs or no god had promised to bee with them in all their iourney to canaan but that they will not now beleeue vnlesse he wil shew his presence by giuing them water in that place and so likewise they tempted him in the want of foood ps can god prepare a table in the wildernesse the consideration whereof must teach vs in all our petitions which we make vnto god for the accomplishment of his promises vnto vs to beware of psalm limiting god as the iewes did by prescribing vnto him time place amp maner for the accomplishment thereof but wait with patience his good leasure for hee that beleeueth will not make haste but wil commit his way to the lord ps secondly god is tempted when man require a signe at his hands thus the pharisies tempted christ matthew master we would see a signe of thee meaning thereby to be certified whether hee were the messias and luke saith they tempted him luke and thus doe all those tempt god which refuse to embrace the doctrine of the gospel because they cannot see the ministers therof to confirme the same by miracles thus do many papists plead against our religion embracing rather the mysterie of iniquity because it is confirmed vnto them by lying wonders not considering that the truth which wee professe was once sufficiently confirmed to bee the truth of god by his owne testimony thereunto in signes amp wonders through the hands of his apostles quest is euery asking of a signe a tempting of god for gedion asked a signe when he was to be a iudge and deliuerer of god people iudg and so did hezekiah to bee assured of the lengthning of his daies king and yet we reade not that god charged them with tempring him but did condescend to their requests answer there be two causes in which we may require a signe of god amp not tempt him first when god commands a man to ask a signe at his hands so might azah haue asked a signe of god for his assurance of victorie according to god promise yes he is isai blamed for not asking it when the lord commanded him secondly a man may aske a signe of god when it serueth for the necessary confirmation of an extraordinary calling or of some special promise of god made to man in this case did gedion aske a signe of god for the further confirmation of his extraordinary calling to bee a deliuerer vnto god people and so did hezekiah for his further assurance in the lengthning of his life by an extraordinary promise fifteene yeares but out of these cases to aske a signe of god is to tempt him as the pharisies did who would prescribe vnto god what kinde of miracle they would haue euen a signe from heauen not contenting themselues with those miracles which christ did ordinarilie worke among them thirdly a man tempts god when he goes on in any sinne against god commandements for hereby he makes needlesse triall of god iustice mercy and patience the lord saith of his people they number tempted him ten times and haue not obeied his voice mal the people murmuringly say they that worke wickednesse are set vp and they that tempt god are deliuered where working wickednesse and tempting of god are al one which serues to admonish vs that with al speed we break off the course of our sins by repentance for while we continue in sinne we tempt god and so lie open to all his iudgements depriuing our selues of the guard and protection of god holy angels nay they will become our enemy and insteed of protection execute god heauy vengeance vpon vs fourthly they tempt god that impose vpon god people there ligious obseruation of legall ceremonies abolished by christ act why tempt ye god saith peter to lay a yoake on the disciples neckes which neither our fathers nor we were able to beare this is to make triall of god power in the sauing of his people whereby we may see how wicked and damnable the roman religion is which wholly stands in the obseruation of ceremonies partly heathenish and partly iudaical whereto when man submit themselues they do nothing else but tempt god fiftly they tempt god that refuse or neglect the ordinarie and necessarie meanes of their preseruation either for body or soule as hee that being to goe ouer a water will leaue the bridge which is the ordinarie way and adventure dangerously through the water for heerein he seekes a needlesse experience of god power so doe they also that neglect or contemne god holy ordinance for the sauing of mens soules in the ministery of the word now to this kinde of tempting god doth christ apply this commandement in this place as if he should say when god hath affoorded vnto man an ordinarie meanes for their helpe and safety they are not to refuse the same and seeke for safety from god extraordinarily i am now in a dangerous place i confesse vpon this pinnacle yet there is some ordinarie way to get down as staires or ladder and therefore vnlesse i would tempt the lord my god i may not cast my selfe downe and thereby seeke for extraordinarie preseruaiton as thou perswadest me thus also they sinne that goe into places of great danger without a calling so peter sinned in thrusting himselfe into caiphas hal a place of temptation as by lamentable experience he found too true thus dauids three worthies sinned in aduenturing vpon their enemy host for the fetching of a little water out of the well of bethlehem amp therfore when it was brought vnto him dauid would not drinke thereof but powred it out for a sacrifice vnto the lord sam heere some may aske whether they do not tempt god that adventure to clime on high places to stand on spire steeples to runne on the ridge of high houses and to goe on ropes a great height from the ground answer man may doe such things in a twofold estate either hauing a lawful calling thereto as carpenters and masons who are to worke vpon high buildings now they without tempting of god may clime and stand on high and dangerous places or else hauing no lawful calling thereto as they who vse to doe such things to make knowen their actiuity or only to affoord delight and admiration vnto others for their priuate gaine and aduantage and such tempt god fearefully for christ was better able to haue cast himselfe downe from this pinnacle and haue preserued himselfe without hurt then these man are to saue themselues in their aduentures and yet hee refused so to do because hee would not tempt the lord his god thus much for the meaning of this commandement the doctrine for instruction hence is to be gathered from this command applied to the text which the diuell alledgeth and it is this whosoeuer looketh for the accomplishment of god promises vnto him must be carefull to walke before god in the waies of his commandements and in the workes of his calling with all good conscience god indeed hath made many gratious promises in his word of blessings temporall and eternall but they that tempt god shall not find the comfort of them mens sinnes hinder these things from them god goodnesse is to bee seene and tasted in the waies of faith and obedience god hath promised the guard of his angels to his children while they keep themselues in their waies if therefore thou wouldest haue this protection thou must keep thy selfe in those waies that god would haue thee to walke in also in theri hesse of his loue god hath made a promise of euerlasting life with freedome from eternall perdition to those that beleeue in christ john thou therefore that wouldest enioy the comfort of this promise to thine immortality and life must get true faith into thy heart and thereby liue all the daies of thy life the same may bee said of euery promise of god pertaining either to soule or body the fruition of them doth depend vpon the practise of some part of obedience which if thou doest neglect thou doest but presume in making title to the promise peter tels symon magus plainely he had no part with them in the gifts of the spirit while his heart retained a purpose to liue in sinne act breake off therefore the course of sinne and inure thy selfe to the practise of obedience so shall god promises be sweet vnto thine heart and the more thou proceedest in obedience the more comfort thou shalt find in god gratious promises but if thou doe lay hold on sinne the comfort of the word will depart from thee and thus much for the second temptation againe the diuell tooke him vp into an exceeding high mountaine and shewed him all the kingdomes of the world and the glory of them and said vnto him all these will i giue thee if thou wilt fall downe and worship me then said iesus vn so him auoid satan for it is written thou shalt worship the lord thy god and him onely shalt thou serue these words containe the third conflict betweene our sauiour christ and satan wherin consider three points i satans preparation v ii satans assault vpon christ v iii christs answer thereto v for the first before wee come to the handling of it in particular wee are to consider that vnto euery assault the diuell prepares himself afresh which should teach vs to labour to furnish our hearts euery day afresh to be able to repulse his new assaults now particularly this preparation hath two parts first satan takes christ into an exceeding high mountaine secondly he shews him all the kingdomes of the world and the glory of them all for the first it may bee demanded what way satan tooke vp christ into this high mountaine answer he might do it two waies either by vision or by reall and locall transportation of his body from the temple to some high mountaine some thinke this was done by vision only in christs mind as ezek ezekiel was caried by the lord from babylon to an exceeding high mountaine in the land of israel but i rather thinke that christ was really and locally transported by the diuell in body from the temple to some high mountaine for christs temptations were not imaginary but true and reall againe the words import a true and reall transportation without any mention of a vision the reasons why the diuell carries christ to an high mountaine may bee these first the diuel hath a great desire to imitate god in his glorious workes that so hee may disgrace the workes of god yes and god himselfe as much as he can now we read deut ampc that god tooke vp moses into mount nebo from whence hee shewed him all the land of canaan so satan that he might seeme to go beyond god takes vp christ into an exceeding high mountaine to shew him all the kingdomes of the world and the glory of them secondly he did it for the furtherance of this last assault wherewith hee tempted christ for hee meant to entice christ with the glory of the world and therefore brings him where hee might take the fairest view thereof now in that satan transports the body of our sauiour christ this second time wee see that by god permission satan may haue power ouer the body of god children to transport the same from place to place or otherwise to vex them and that not once onely but sundrie times this we must obserue and remember carefully as a stay and prop against distrust amp despaire if god should suffer satan to vex vs by such transporting of our body from place to place or by any outward calamity amp that not once or twise but diverse times for that which befell the head christ iesus may well befall any of his members the second part of the diuels preparation is this he shewes vnto christ all the kingdoms of the world amp the glory of them this he could not do actually for there is no mountaine so high in all the world whereon if a man were placed he could see one halfe or one quarter of the kingdomes of the world as they are seated and placed vpon the face of the earth nay if a man were set in the sun and from thence could looke vnto the earth yet hee could not see past the halfe therof and therefore wee must know that the diuel did this in a counterfet vision for heerein hee can frame an imitation of god now the diuels visions bee of two sorts either in the outward senses or in the mind and vnderstanding his visions in the outward senses be delusions whereby he makes man be leeue they see that which indeed they do not see this might easily be proued by manifold examples recorded in the history of all times but that one shall suffice of his counterfait resemblance of sam samuels forme and attire to the witch of endor for the deluding of saul when as indeed samuels true body was in the graue and his soule with the lord secondly the diue hath visions wherbv he deludes the vnderstanding zak the lord saith heereof the prophets shalbe ashamed euery one of his vision these visions the diuell shewes to man sometime sleeping and sometime waking euen as the lord doth shew his visions to his owne servant the visions of satan shewed to man sleeping are called dreames deut the false prophet hath his dreame his visions shewed to man waking are to such as haue crazed brame whom he perswades strange things of themselues as some that they are kings or princes others that they are christ john baptist amp such like examples heereof in all ages are many now touching this vision of satan to christ some thinke it was inward in christs minde but i rather take it to haue beene in his outward senses only as the words of the text do import the diuell by his article did cunningly set forth and represent vnto the eies of christ a notable shew and representation of all the kingdomes of the earth and the glory of them heerein the diuell sheweth great power and skill in that he can represent vnto the eie in his counterfet visions such strange and admirable sights and it teacheth vs that the practises of forcerers and magicians vndertaking to represent vnto the eie partly in the aire and partly in glasses either the persons of man that liued long since or actions done in farre country or long before are not meere fancies as some thinke who deny altogether that such things can be shewed for the diuell can resemble things done long since and a far off for if he could set such a sight before the eie of our sauiour christ in vision as the view of the whole world and the glory thereof then much more can he represent vnto the eie of man strange and maruellous things the diuels drift in this resemblance vnto christ is this heereby he intended most cunningly to insinuat himselfe into the heart of our sauior christ for before he propounds this third assault hee shews vnto christ all the kingdomes of the world and the glorie of them that christ might take a liking of them and so desire them and at length accept of them vpon satans offer thus he dealt with our first parents gen vpon their first communication he shewes vnto eue the outward beauty of the forbidden fruit that it was faire to locke vpon and tels her of the good estate they should attain vnto by eating of it and so at length brings her to yeeld to his temptation hence we must learne to haue speciall care in the good ordering of all the outward senses of our body specially the two senses of learning seeing and hearing for by them the diuell can cunningly conuey his temptations into our hearts the senses specially these two are the windowes of the heart and soule and if we keepe them not well satan will be sure to conuay some euill into vs we must therefore obey salomons counsell prou keepe thy heart aboue all watch and ward this we cannot do vnlesse we looke well to our outward senses for they are the doores of the heart this made dauid to pray psalm lord turne away mine eies from beholding vanity and iob iob to make a couenant with his eies and so must wee make conscience of hearing and looking lest thereby wee giue aduantage to the tempter further in this sight obserue the deep policy of the diuell there are in the kingdomes of the world besides glory and dignity many troubles hurliburlies and vexations now these the diuell conceales from christ and shewes him only the glory pompe wealth and dignity of the world that so hee might the more easily winde his temptation into the heart of our sauiour christ and this same course he stil obserueth in tempting man to sinne he hides from their eies all the miseries plagues and punishments which are due to sin and that will follow vpon it and shewes them onely all the profit and delights that they may reape thereby thus hee sugars ouer the poison of his temptations that man neuer feele the bitternesse of them till their soules be thereby deadly infected but then he takes a cleane contrary course and shewes to the wounded soule all the woes and terrours of god wrath that if it be possible he may bring a man to despaire and therefore we must be most watchfull of being insnated with the deceitfulnesse of sinne in the false shew of profit and pleasure secondly the diuels policy doth notably appeare in reseruing this temptation for the last place for he knowes full well how forcible with man be the temptations of profit pleasures amp honors from whence we may also learne that temptations fetched on the right hand from honour pleasure and commodity are the most dangerous and doe soonest creepe into the heart of man preuailing far more then temptations on the left hand which are taken from aduersity the diuell foiled sam dauid worse in the time of peace amp ease then euer he could do during the time of sauls grieuous persecution against him and he preuailed more against the church by errours and heresies vnder constantine and other christian emperours then he could do by most bloudy persecution for the space of three hundred years before yes in these our daies wordly hopes haue drawn those from the syncerity of religion whom outward violence could not moue prosperity is a slippery path wherein a man doth soone catch a fall and therefore we must learne to be most watchfull ouer our owne harts when we haue fairest weather with the world lastly s luke luke addeth this circumstance of time that the diuell shewed all these things vnto christ in as short a time as might be euen in a moment or point of time whereby we may perceiue the diuels great celerity amp speed in doing any thing he takes in hand herein he goes beyond all man in the world for being a spirit hee is able to worke wonders and though he cannot go beyond the strength and compasse of nature because his power is finite yet by reason of his agility and speed he can goe beyond the ordinary course of nature in the maner of working the things hee takes in hand and this exceeding quicke speed the diuell heere vseth to stirre vp in christ a more eager desire after those strange amp goodly things wherof he had but as it were a glimple that so by degrees he might worke in christ a liking of them for the nature of man doth more eagerly affect strange things when they be sudden and the eie of man doth more wistly behold them and this also as the former must make vs watchful against all satans crafty wiles that wee be not beguised by him thus much for satans preparation the second point in this conflict is the temptation it selfe in these words verse and said vnto him all these will i giue thee if thou wilt fall downe and worship me the drift of satan in this assault which we must carefully obserue is to draw christ to commit idolatry by the hope of wordly kingdomes and the glory of them heerwith he proues him when he could neither weaken his faith by his first temptation nor worke presumption in him by his second and looke how he dealeth heere with christ so doth he commonly in the world many a ones conscience and religion doth he quite ouerthrow by wordly hopes of riches pleasures and preserments heerby not only ordinary professours but ministers and preachers of the gospell haue beene drawen to absure and renounce that truth which formerlie they haue taught and to betake themselues as the popes vassals to professe and maintain his blasphemous idolatries heerby also protestant merchant are drawen to become very seruiceable to the popish churches by transporting among them wax and such like merchandize which serue as necessary helps amp furtherances to their idolatrous seruice and what else is it that makes the people generally to change religion with the times and states but because they would still enioy their wordly commodity and the more man doe possesse in the world ordinarily the lesse courage and resolution they haue for the religion of god as experience in queen maries daies hath shewed which in generall may admonish vs how dangerous an enemy the world is to the power of true religion this temptation hath two parts a promise made to christ and the condition thereof the promise in these words all these will i giue thee he saith not i will procure god to giue them vnto thee but i will giue thee them where we may see that satans drift is to cause christ to take him for his lord to depend and wait on him for his kingdom and to acknowledge him to be the giuer thereof which notably bewraies his egregious boldnesse that dares thus challenge to himselfe the lord owne right euen in the presence of him who was true lord amp king of heauen and earth let no man therefore thinke that satan will lose ought for want of adventure but in regard thereof be better armed against him now that which the diuell aimed at in christ doth hee commonly effect in the world he makes man beleeue that he is the giuer of all things and so brings many a one to relie vpon him indeed with their lips man wil confesse that god giues them their daily bread euen all things they haue but their dealings and practises speake aloud that the diuel is gouerner and giuer of all for how do many man get their liuings is it not by lying fraud and oppressio doe not most man heereby seeke to inrich themselues wel the iust lord neuer approueth such meanes the diuel setteth such courses a flote and him they serue and on him they rely that walke therein secondly note a further reach of satan in this promise of these earthly kingdomes euen to ouerthrow christs spirituall kingdome satan knew well that if christ were the true messias he should be a king and haue a kingdome though not earthly yet spirituall in the hearts and consciences of man which should be the ruine of his kingdome and therfore he labours with christ to entertaine an earthly kingdome that so his spiritual kingdome might not be looked after and looke as hee seekes to deale with christ the head so he perseueres against the church which is his body for god church hath it ministery which in it nature is a soueraigntie to be exercised in the dispensation of the word now the diuell hath laboured by all meanes to bring this ministerie wherein the churches spirituall soueraignty doth consist to become an earthly lordship and dominion that by this meanes he might ouerturne it and make it fruitlesse in the building and vpholding of christs spiritual kingdome and how he hath preuailed this way the church of rome doth shew to all the world thirdly obserue the largenesse of the diuels promise he will giue to christ all the kingdomes of the world and the glorie of them but this is more then he meant to our sauiour christ at leastwise more then he could perform for all these were not in his power now because in all things we must be as vnlike the diuell as may be hence we must learn to be wary and watchful to our promises that therein we be not like vnto satan promising that which we neuer meane to performe or neuer can performe though we meant it in all our promises therefore we must looke to two things first whether the thing we promise be in our power secondly whether it be lawful and meet for vs to performe and thus making promises we must endeuour alwayes to make good the same this fidelitie in keeping promise is a fruit of the spirit called by the apostle faith gal and a propertie of him that must rest in god holy mountaine psalm not to change from a mans lawful oath or promise though the performance of it tend to his great hinderance fourthly in this promise of satan we may obserue that hee knowes all the kingdomes of the world else he could not haue shewed them to him which heere he offers to giue yes his offer of them with the glory of them al which hee could so speedily represent doth shew vnto vs that hee is most expert in the policies and regiments of states and kingdomes hee goes not to and fro for nought compassing the earth iob and his promise of them to christ was made to inflame his heart with ambition after those kingdomes and glories that he might enioy some of them at the least wherein we may note that one speciall practise of the diuell is to ouerturne states and kingdomes by putting ambition into mens hearts after earthly kingdomes and glories his study is to do mischiefe and in the ruine of kingdoms he ouerthrowes many and therefore heereunto hee endeuours himselfe with might and maine hence come insurrections amp rebellions in kingdomes which no time nor age could euer escape looke as he stirred vp the chaldeans and sabeans to inrich themselues by the spoiling of iob so dealeth he by ambitious and couetous persons in all estates as true records of times do fully testifie we may see the truth heereof in our own land in the manifold complots and treasons both at home and abroad that haue been conspired and attempted against our queen elizabeth and it may fitly be applied to our present state prince and state by profane man stirred vp by the diuell through ambition amp discontent howsoeuer by god mercy themselues haue beene taken in the snare that they laid for others in regard whereof we are all bound to yeeld all praise and glory to god for his gratious preseruation and defence both of our prince amp state and to shew forth our thankfulnesse by all holy obedience vnto that god who hath brought to nought the diuelish conspiracies amp treacheries of the ambitious instruments of satan secondly we must pray vnto god continually for the preseruation of our prince amp state crying aloud vnto god as the people did at the coronation king of salomon for the safety of our prince yes we must daily intreat the lord to bring to nought the counsell of achitophels amp of all that think evil against the lord anointed among vs quest but how comes it to passe that any prince or state can stand if the diuell haue such malice against them answer through the good prouidence of god who giues his good angels charge to guard and defend not only his children in particular but also whole kingdoms and states and one part of their office is for the good of god church to repell the rage of satan and his instruments yes to stand with god church in the execution of iudgements vpon the enemy thereof in the siege of iericho an heauenly iosh captaine of the lord of hosts came to helpe ioshuah and when the king of syria sent a mighty host to take the prophet elisha that was in dothan the lord sent for his defence king horse amp chariots of fire which filled the mountaines and in the dayes of hezekia for his comfort and the ioy of god people an angel of the lord slew in the host of zenacherib that came against ierusalem an hundred fourescore and fiue thousand in one night and wee want not sure testimonie of this good prouidence of god in the strange discoueries of many diuelish conspiracies fiftly satan saith all these will i giue thee this is the voice of the great red dragon and the same is the voice of the pope of rome both registred in their canons and daily attempted in practise to dispose of all the kingdomes of the earth whereby he shewes euidently that he is that reu beast comming out of the earth hauing two hornes like the lambe but he spake like the dragon for the lambs hornes he shewes in calling himselfe the servant of sernants and the voice of the dragon that is of the diuel in taking vpon him to dispose of the soueraignties of these earthly kingdoms lastly saint luke recordeth a reason which the diuell addeth to his promise to preuent all conceit of impossibility in him to performe the same to wit for that luke the power and glory of all the kingdomes of the world is deliuered to him and to whomsoeuer he will be giues it wherein obserue in satan two notorious sinnes first a grosse lie for daniel saith daniel that it is iehouah the most high god who beareth rule ouer all the kingdomes of man and giueth them to whomsoeuer he wil secondly arrogant and shamelesse boasting to vaunt himselfe euen to the lord owne face as though he were soueraigne lord of that which belongs to god alone the consideration whereof must moue vs who in all godlie conuersation must be contrary to satan to renounce all lying and to make conscience to speake the truth from our hearts and also to abandon all vaine boasting of our selues what we are or what we can do yes rather to speake basely of our selues that so god in all good things we do may haue the glory lying and bragging are the properties of satan and therefore can not beseeme the tongue and heart of the children of god the second point in this temptation is the hard condition which satan would haue christ to yeeld vnto for this gift if thou wilt fall down amp worship me euen to commit most abominable idolatry in worshipping the diuell himselfe heerein we may obserue sundrie things first that it is a principall part of the diuels endeuours against god church to seeke the ouerthrow of true religion and the pure worship of god by sowing therein the seed of heresies and idolatries for if he dares be thus bold with christ the head as to seeke to draw him from the worship of his father to such abominable idolatry what will he not attempt with silly and sinfull man the scriptures are plentifull in shewing his indeuours this way michaiah saw in vision kin an euill spirit offer himselfe vnto god to become a lying spirit in the mouth of all ahabs prophets euen foure hundred at one time when iehoshuah zak the high priest stood before the lord satan stood at his right hand to resist him hee sought to hinder the building and worship of the materiall temple much more therefore will he seeke to hinder the building of the spirituall temple euen the worke of the ministery in conuersion of soules whereby they are pulled out of satans kingdome and made pillars in the temple of the liuing god satan is that matth enuious man that soweth tares of errors and heresies in the church of god which is the field of the good husbandman he hindred thes paul from comming to the thessalonians whereby it appeares that he did his endeuour to hinder the course of the apostolicall ministery in the church of smyrna reu he cast some into prison stirring vp wicked man so to do thereby to hinder the embracing of the gospell reu john saw three vncleane spirits like frogges come out of the mouth of the dragon and out of the mouth of the beast and out of the mouth of the false prophet these are spirits of diuels working miracles and going to the kings of the earth thither they go for the stoppage of the gospell for if kings oppose themselues they become greatest hinderers to the gospell of all other and these frogges by the common consent of catholike expositors are the rabble of popish friers priests and jesuit who seeke the infection of states thorow all the world by all which the diuels enmitie against the church is most apparent the vse i this shewes what care and diligence god ministers should shew for the building of god church and the furtherance of the gospell for they should seeke to the vttermost of their power to counteruaile the enuious practise of satan against the church ii euery christian must hence learne to pray not only for their owne good estate but also for the welfare of god church euery where in the free passage of the gospell in the establishing of true doctrine and in the continuance of constant obedience therunto for satans endeuour is to subuert and corrupt the truth and to draw man from obedience and vnto him god children must euer oppose themselues the rather because their welfare stands in the good of god church secondlie in this condition of satans offer to christ wee may obserue that his endeuour is to bring man to worship him for if he durst attempt a demaund heerof at the hands of christ who shall thinke to escape this assault when oportunity serues him and howsoeuer man thinke it impossible that satan should thus far preuaile with any as to bring them to worship him yet doubtlesse though hee could not preuaile with christ heerein hee attaines his purpose in the world and that with the greatest part thereof for the three religions of the iew turke and papist doe at this day ouerspread the greatest part of the face of the earth and in them all such a worship of god is propounded vnto man wherein god is not worshipped but the diuell for the euidence whereof marke these two rules first that all doctrines denised by man in the matter of religion which either directly or by iust consequence oppugne the word of god are doctrines of diuels tim doctrines repugnant to the word touching mariage and meares are doctrines of diuels and so by proportion are all such like secondly all deuised worship of god by man against god word is no worship of god but of the diuell corinthian the things which the gentiles sacrifice they sacrifice vnto diuels and not vnto god doubtlesse the gentiles intended to worship god in their images but because that worship was not according to god wil the apostle respects not their intent as a thing that could nothing auaile in this case but saith peremptorily their worship was done vnto the diuell and in reason it must bee so for why should wee thinke that god should accept that for his worship which is not agreeable to his will but denised by man according to the will of the diuel from these two rules it will follow that the best of the three forenamed religions is no worship of god but of the diuell for all of them haue such worship as is deuised by man amp not of god the iew worships god out of christ and so doth the turke yes and the papists worship god but yet out of the true christ for as hath beene shewed elsewhere the christ of the papists is a counterfet christ and in many other points of their religion there is apparent repugnancy to the word of god yes of their sacrifice of the masse wee may as truly say as the apostle did of heathen idol worship that they sacrifice not vnto god but to the diuell for therein is as vile accursed and abominable idolatry as euer was deuised by man so that it is plaine the diuel doth mightily preuaile in causing man to worship him yes hee preuaileth thus not onely in the world but in god church for all such as notwithstanding their outward profession haue their hearts set vpon the world more eagerly affecting the honours profit and pleasures thereof then god and his word do in deed and truth worship the diuell for hee is the corinthian god of this world ruling in the heart of the children of disobedience by the baites of honour profit and pleasure he steales mens hearts from god and so heerein they doing the will of the diuell must needs worship him for looke whereon a man seteth his heart that hee maketh his god thirdly heere obserue that the diuell would faine make a couenant with christ for worship at christs hands he wil giue christ the glory amp riches of the world heereto is nothing wanting but christs consent whereby we see that it may bee true which sundrie times wee heare of and many history do record to witte that some persons doe make a league with the diuell wherein the diuell couenanteth to be seruiceable vnto them in procuring them honour riches pleasures or great renowme for some strange actiuities wherto he will enable them vpon condition that they for their parts giue vnto him their body their soules or their bloud some indeed are of mind that such things are meere forgeries and delusions of the diuell and that no league can bee made betweene him and man but they are deceiued for hee attempted in effect such a thing with christ what will hee not therefore do with silly and sinfull man especially when he finds them cast downe with discontents and thus much for the diuels assault the third point in this conflict is christ answer verse then iesus said vnto him auoid satan for it is written thou shalt worship the lord thy god and him only shalt thou serue this i will handle as the words do lie in order before his answer hee propoundeth a speech of indignation and detestation both of the diuell and his offer auoid satan as if he should say i haue heard thee satan to speake imuriously against my fathers word and against my selfe and now againe thou vtterest blasphemy against my father wherein thou goest about to dishonour him greatly but i abhorte thee satan and these thy temptations therfore hence auoid and haue no more to do with me in this detestation of christ towards satan for vttering blasphmie against his father in his chalenge to haue power to dispose of all the kingdomes of the world as being his own we are taught not onely to greeue at such blasphemies as we shall heare vttered against god but to testifie our detestation and indignation towards them the world is full of black mouthed rabshekaes who wil not spare to blaspheme the glorious name of our god amp to scoffe amp deride his sacred word now whe we meet with such we must not be like stoicks without affection but in christian wisdome from bleeding harts for the reproch of god shew forth godly zeale and indignation for the rescue of his glorie the hypocriticall practise of wicked iezabel king in proclaming a fast vpon the false accusation of nabothes blasphemie against god and the king may teach god church to be zealous indeed aagainst all blasphemers when rabiheka railed on the god of israel king good king hezekiahrent his cloth and humbled himselfe in great measure for that reproch against his god teares ps were dauids meat day and night while the heathen among whom he was constrained to liue said vnto him where is thy god and iust lot pet vexed his righteous soule from day to day with the unlawful deeds of the filthie sodomites liuing among them the practise of these godly man must be a president for vs to follow that we heare no blasphemie against god without detestation and as all god children must practise this duty so especially masters of families dauid ps would not suffer a lier or a slanderer to come in his sight or to abide in his house much lesse would he haue endured a blasphemer of god or a slanderer of his word the law commanded that the leuit blasphemer should he stoned to death who wittinglie and willingly spake a word against god and no doubt this law is perpetuall let a man but speake a word of disgrace against an earthlie prince and it costs him his life and that iustlie how much more then should he die the death though he had a thousand liues that shall blaspheme the king of kings shal one that hath been baptized into the name of christ say there is no god and that the scriptures are but a deuice of man and yet liue god forbid for this hellish sinne defiles a kingdome and therefore the magistrate with the sword of iustice must cry out against such wretches away from vs blasphemers secondly in this auant of christ giuen to satan wee learne how to behaue our selues against entisers from religion and the obedience of god wee must hold them as limmes of the diuell and in that regard haue nothing to do with them but with christ bid them auoid from vs the deutr lord commanded that in this case parents should not spare their owne children nor children spare their parents if they were enticers to idolatry but their owne hands must be first vpon them to put them to death our sauiour christ would not spare peter when he gaue him bad counsell to spare himselfe from suffering that which god hath ordained for him but saith vnto him math get behind me satan so that we are without excuse if we shal reiect this counsel of salomo prou heare no more the instruction that causeth to erre from the words of knowledge thirdly heer by we also learne how to behaue our selues towards satan when he is violent and importunate in his temptations to wit that howsoeuer we may reply to them out of god word when they are more milde yet when satan begins therein to shew his force and violence we must not reason with him for christ would not endure his blasphemy though hee answered his temptations in schooles of learning it is counted a simple part to hold alwaies to the conclusion but in the schole of christ when the conscience is to deale with satan the safest way is by both hands of faith to lay fast hold of the conclusion cleause fast to christ let the diuell say what he wil be not drawen thence one iot after christ hath shewed his detestation to satans blasphemy he answers his temptation saying it is written thou shalt worship the lord thy god ampc and whereas he saith the third time it is written taking his answer from the scripture it teacheth vs that scripture of it selfe is of power sufficient to vanquish the diuell this the church of rome wil not admit for they make scripture to bee of two kinds inward and outward by inward scripture they meane the vniuersall consent of all catholikes in all ages and by outward scripture they vnderstand the written word contained in the bible now they say inward scripture is the more excellent for the outward scripture they call a dead letter of little or no power amp they make general councels equall with them for substance of doctrine if this were true christ would not haue alledged outward scripture as they call it but hee knew the written word was the powerfull weapon sufficient to vanquish the diuell and therefore heerein they doe shamefully blaspheme the truth of god and so god himselfe secondly this allegation of christ teacheth vs how to behaue our selues against all enemy to the truth that would allure vs to heresie as to popery anabaptisme or such like namely to stick fast to the text of scripture and not to suffer our selues by any meanes to bee drawen from it it may bee thou article vnlearned and thine enemie both learned and eloquent yet heere is thy refuge cleaue the faster to this written word and if thou haue one text for thy truth make more account thereof then of all the restimonies of councels fathers or man whatsoeuer this instruction is needfull for it may bee god will suffer seducers to try his children and then vnlesse they keep sure this ground of faith they shall surely be seduced the text which christ alledgeth for his answer is taken out of deutr where the words are thus read thou shalt feare the lord thy god and serue him at the first it may seem that christ misalledgeth that text and corrupteth it for where moses saith thou shalt feare the lord thy god christ saith thou shalt worship the lord thy god and to the latter part christ addeth the word onely saying him onely shalt thou serue for that which moses saith and serue him but the truth is heere is no corruption but a most worthy allegation as wee shall plainly see if wee consider two things first that christ and his apostles in alledging the scriptures of the old testament did not so much respect the words as the true and proper meaning of the place secondly that they oft expound the places which they alledge and therupon do sometimes vary in word but stil retaine the true sense and meaning so it is in this text alleaged moses saith thou shalt feare the lord thy god vnderstanding by feare religious awe and reneronce and christ saying thou shalt worship or adore the lord thy god vnderstandeth by worship outward adoration in bowing of the body whereby we testifie the inward awe and reuerence of the heart as when we humble our selues to call vpon god by praier and this change of words by christ serues for excellent vse in this place to wit to let vs more clearly see what this feare of god is to feare god in that place is from a reuerent awe of the heart towards god to humble a mans selfe in prostrating his body before the lord either to praise god for benefits receiued or to pray vnto him for gifts and graces needfull againe for the word which he addeth therein is no fault at all for the ful sense and true meaning of moses text must needs include so much as the prohibition annexed in the verse following doth plainly shew for saying thou shalt feare the lord thy god and serue him and adding thou shalt not walke after other god verse is it not all one as if hee had said thou shalt serue him only so that we haue inst cause to blesse god for the true and plaine explaning of the words and not to surmise the least corruption in the alledging of them now then for our further instruction in this text alledged consider two points first what worship and seruice is secondly to whom it belongeth first worship in generall betokeneth the exhibiting and giuing of reuerence and honour to another this worship is two fold ciuill or diuine ciuill worship is that outward reuerence and honour which one man giues to another as by prostrating the body bowing the knee ampc the end of ciuill worship is to testifie and acknowledge superiority and preheminence in another either for authority and office as the subiect worships his king and gouernour or for gifts and graces or for old age as inferiours in gifts and yonger in age by due reuerence must acknowledge in this ciuill maner did iacob bow himselfe euen times to his brother esau thereby acknowledging him for his superiour and better gen thus also did abraham bow himselfe before the hittites gen and lot vnto the angels that came into sodome taking them to be but man gen and in this ciuill maner it is lawful to kneele before kings and princes to testifie our subiection vnto them and loyall acknowledgement of their preheminence ouer vs vnder god diuine worship is the ascribing of diuinity to the thing we honour wherby we make it vnto vs some diuine thing aboue the order of any creature a man may ascribe diuinity vnto a thing foure waies first by attributing the godhead vnto it or giuing vnto it such honour whereby he acknowledgeth the same to be god secondly by ascribing vnto it the attributes of god as omnipresence omnipotency to bee most iust to know all things ampc thirdly by accepting and acknowledging it to be the creator and gouernour of all things fourthly by acknowledging it to bee the giuer of all good things the defender and deliuerer from all euill and to whatsoeuer thing in worship a man ascribes any of these to the same doth he ascribe diuinity this diuine worship doth principally consist in religion and piety for by religion which indeed is god worship and by piety do man ascribe vnto a thing diuine and religious honour diuine worship is two fold inward in the mind or outward in the body inward diuine worship is whe a man giues his heart amp soule to any thing deuoting thereto the affections of his heart as loue feare ioy hope faith and confidence and that because he conceiueth it to be god hauing diuine properties as omnipotency infinite wisedome iustice mercy ampc or being the creator and gouernour of all or the giuer of all good things vnto him and his preseruer from all euill this deuoting of the heart and soule vnto god with the faculties amp affections therof is the ground and substance of all diuine worship and indeed can be giuen to nothing but to that which is god or conceiued of as god outward diuine worship is when a man shall any way bow prostrate or cast downe his body to any thing thereby to testifie that his mind and heart are deuoted to it as that hee holds it to be god to be omnipotent ampc creator and gouernour and his preseruer and therfore hee doth repose his trust and affiance therein set his loue joy and feare thereon aboue all other things and heere wee may obserue a difference betweene ciuill worship and diuine by outward ciuill worship we only acknowledge preheminence and superiority in another in regard of authority of gifts age or such like but by outward diuine worship wee acknowledge diuinity to be in the thing wherto we bow or prostrate our selues againe wee must heere also remember that outward diuine worship serues onely to restifie the inward euen to make knowen what thing it is which wee conceiue to be god and whereto wee haue deuoted the affections of our hearts thus we see what worship is and the kinds thereof and heere we must vnderstand our sauiour christ to meane outward diuine worship as if hee should say thou shalt religiously submit bow or prostrate thy body vnto god in praier or thanksgiuing thereby testifying that thou hast deuoted thy heart and soule vnto him not onely conceiuing him to be the diuine essence omnipotent infinite ampc but also that thou doest rest and relie on him as on thy creator who doth blesse thee with all good things and preserue thee from all euill besides this worship christ doth mention a seruing of god which being distinguished from worship must needs import some other thing seruice in generall is nothing else but the giuing and performing of obedience to the commandement of another this seruice is twofold absolute or in part absolute seruice is when a man obeies the commandement of another without any condition or exception and that not only in body outwardly but in soule and conscience in thought will amp affection and this absolute seruice is proper to god alone for wee must neuer call his commandements into question but looke what god commands and as hee commands it so must we simply and absolutely yeeld obedience thereto not only outwardly in body but inwardly in soule and spirit with the powers and faculties thereof and in all the affections of our heart seruice in part is that which is due to gouernours and superiors from their inferiours in the lord for god hath giuen power to magistrates heere on earth to make lawes for the good of ciuil estates in yeelding obediece wherunto their inferiors must doe them seruice yet not absolutely but with restraint to wit in the lord so far foorth as their commands agree with the wil of god and crosse not his command againe our obedience vnto them is in body and outward conuersation indeed we must from the heart yeeld seruice and obedience vnto them but yet the conscience properly cannot bee bound by mens lawes they only concerne the outward man in speech gesture and behauiour now of these two kinds of seruice our sauior christ speaketh here of simple and absolute seruice whereby both soule and body with all the powers and parts thereof yeeld absolute obedience and subiection to the will and commandement of god wee see what worship and seruice is heere required now wee must obserue the person to whom the same is to be giuen in these words the lord thy god diuine worship whether inward or outward and absolute seruice of the whole man must be giuen to no creature angell or man be they neuer so excellent but to the true god alone the scope and drift of the first and second commandements is to bind euery man to giue so much to his god and to beware of giuing the same to any other besides the lord and the practise of the good angell that talked with reu john doth shew the same thing for when john fell before his feet to worship him the angell said see thou do it notworship god where we see the good angels do striue for the furtherance of god right in these duties howsoeuer this wicked spirit tempting christ doth heerein seeke god great disgrace and thus we may perceiue that christs applying of this text against satans temptation is most pregnant for satan requiring of christ the prostrating of his body before the diuell in token that he did worship him as the giuer of those kingdomes which he offered vnto christ is iustly repulsed by this text which bindeth euery man to giue outward diuine worship whereby the inward worship of the heart is signified to god alone and not to any creature heere then we may learne that it is not lawful to giue to saint or angel or any creature whatsoeuer outward diuine worship or adoration whereby the inward deuotion of the heart is testified this text is plaine to the contrary and the reason we haue heard because diuine prostrating of the body to any thing is a testification that we ascribe diuinity vnto it some way which without the guilt of idolatry cannot bee done to any creature for let a man worship saint or angell by praier or thanksgiuing and therein he doth ascribe vnto them some propriety of the diuine nature as to know the heart to be able to heare to helpe or such like the papists heere say they doe not thinke the saints to whom they pray to be god neither do they worship them as god but this will helpe them little for the diuell mouing christ to yeeld vnto him outward diuine worship neuer meant that christ should adore him for god but onely desired that by this outward adoration of prostrating his body before him christ would acknowledge him to be the giuer of those kingdomes for he durst not be so bold as absolutely to desire to be worshipped for god and yet christ tels him that outward diuine worship euen in respect of the acknowledgement of such a gift is proper to god alone and yet the church of rome do giue vnto saints that which the diuell demands and christ denies by appropriating it vnto god for they make seuerall saints deliuerers and protectors from seuerall diseases and dangers as the virgin mary breuiat in missa quotid de b maria from shipwracke s roch missale amp breuiar sarisbut in missa de sancto rocho from the pestilence raphael alan cop dial from sore aies kem exam concil trid part cap de inuo sanct apollonia from the tooth ach and iac de vorag ur leg c catharine for al maner of afflictions yes they make them patrons and protectours of whole country and kingdomes as saint iames for spaine saint denis for france saint patricke for ireland ampc now since many a one may giue a kingdome that cannot defend it let all man iudge whether they doe not giue more vnto saints than satan demanded to be acknowledged vnto him by our sauiour christ yes they make them intercessours for the procuring of the sauour of god and life euerlasting they call the virgin mary the queene of heauen and pray to her that by the authority of a mother she would command her son to heare their praiers which is to make christ a punie and vnderling vnto her which are greater matters then the disposing of earthly kingdomes heere they say that they may do that to the glorious saints in heauen which is done to earthly princes for man adore them and in their absence fall downe before their chaire of estate answer the adoration giuen to princes is but a ciuill acknowledgement of their preheminence and kneeling before their chaire of estate is only a ciuil testimony of loyaltie and subiection it is not directed to the princes person being absent but only serueth to testifie his subiection to that authoritie and power which is set ouer him in the lord there is no diuine propriety ascribed by either of these vnto the person or authority of the prince but now in bowing down to pray to saints there is religious adoration giuen them for therein be ascribed vnto them these diuine properties that they can know the heart heare and helpe afarre off pray for them in particular and such like by all which god is robbed of his honour and though we condemne the papists for giuing to saints diuine worship yet wee must beware of despising the saints of god in heauen for there is due vnto them a threefold honour first thanksgiuing to god for them who inabled them by his gifts and graces to be in their times speciall instruments of good vnto god church secondly we are to carrie a reuerent estimation of them being now in heauen as of the friends of god and temples of his holy spirit thirdly we are to follow the example of their godly conuersatios in the duties of godlinesse but from giuing vnto them diuine worship we must carefully abstaine againe if the diuine worship of saints be heere condemned then much more is the worshipping of their reliques then also is their instituting and obseruing fasting daies and holy daies vnto their saints heere iustly reproued neither can our church heerein be condemned with them though wee retaine the names of such daies among vs because it is for another end out fasts are meerely ciuill on such daies and our holy dayes turned from the adoration of saints to the seruice of god whereon also our conscience knowes her libertie giuen of god for honest labour in a lawful calling as neede requires further obserue how christ heere ioines the worship of god and the seruice of god together teaching vs not to content our selues with doing the duties of god worship but withall wee must yeeld vnto him absolute seruice and obedience man commonly thinke they haue done enough if on daies appointed they come to the church and there performe outward worship vnto god in hearing the word in praier and receiuing the sacraments these i confesse be worthy workes if they be well performed but heerein is the common errour that when they haue performed this outward worship they make no conscience of absolute seruice the thing which christ heere ioines to worship they thinke that in their callings they may liue as they list either idly or vniustly by fraud and dissembling but seuer not thou seruice from worship which christ hath ioyned together lest god say vnto thee forthy worship as hee did once to the iewes isay my soule hateth your new moones and your appointed feasts they are a burden vnto me ampc what doth god hate that worship himselfe appointed no but he hares the seuering of it from seruice and obedience wherein they should shew foorth to their brother loue iustice and mercy he reiects all seruice at their hands because their hands were full of blood v read micha v the offer of sacrifice was a speciall part of worship vnder the law and yet though a man should bring for his sacrifice thousands of rammes or ten thousand river of oile nay though he brought his first borne the fruite of his body for the sinne of his soule yet all is nothing without iustice mercy humbling himselfe and walking with his god verse let vs therefore serue god sincerely in our conuersations as wee seeme to honour him in duties of religion let vs shew the feare of god in our liues for worship without seruice is like the cutting off of a dogs head or offer swines flesh ampc as i say which is abhomination to the lord thirdly obserue that christ addeth only to moses words for the better clearing of moses meaning which may serue for our iust defence against the papists they blame vs greatly for teaching that a man is iustified by faith only saying the word only is not in any place ascribed to iustification by faith we answer in all the old testament this word only is not ioyned to this command thou shalt worship the lord thy god and serue him and yet christ saith it is written him only shalt thou serue because the restraint and inhibition annexed from giuing this worship and seruice to any other doth in effect include only euen so though in letters and syllables we doe not find this word only adioyned to this sentence man is iustified by faith yet because of the exclusion of workes vsually annexed to that phrase as that we are iustified by faith without the workes of the law rom and are iustified freely by his grace v and that a man is not iustified by the workes of the law but by faith gal hereupon i say we may hold and teach and that truly according to the true sense thereof following christs example in this place that the scripture saith a man is iustified by faith only lastly from this commandement we must learne our duty touching god seruice in word we wil all acknowledge our selues to be his servant but if heerin we will approue our selues to be his servant we must resolue and labour to yeeld vnto him absolute obedience as well in hart mind will and affection as in outward conuersation the end of the ministery of the word is not onely to reforme the outward man but corinthian to cast downe the inward holds of sinne in the imagination and to bring into captiuitie euery thought to the obedience of christ and this is done when after true repentance a man endeuoureth to yeeld vnto god totall obedience and that from the whole man in soule and body and spirit not for a time but continually then the diuell left him and behold the angels came and ministred vnto him these words containe the third part of this description of christs temptation to wit the happie euent and issue thereof in christs glorious victory ouer the tempter which is the principall part wherein consists the maine comfort of god church for as in temptation christ stood in our roome and stead so is this victory not his a lone but the victory of his church this issue conteines two parts first satans departing from him secondly the ministery of good angels vnto him for the first then the diuell left him that is after that by temptations he could nothing auaile then he betakes himselfe to flight in this appeares the vnspeakeable mercie of god vnto his church in mitigating and in due time putting an end vnto the afflictions and temptations thereof for the case of christ the head in this conflict is the case and condition of all his members now heere we see what a gratious issue the lord put to these great assaults of satan in due time his enimie flies and so will the lord deale in all the miseries of his church amp children god promiseth to dauid concerning salomon sam that if he sin hee will chastise him with the roddes of man and with the plagues of the children of man that is with such punishments as he shall be able to beare but his mercy he will not take from him the prophet habacucke in his complaint against the wrong amp violence of the wicked done to the iust is somewhat impatient towards god for his delay hab therefore in the vision afterward shewed vnto him he is bid to waite for deliuerance for though it tary yet it shall surely come and shall not stay cha thus paul comforteth the christian corinthians god is faithfull and will not suffer you to be tempted aboue that which ye are able to beare but will giue an issue with the temptation that ye may be able to beare it corinthian reu the body of the two prophets who were slaine for the testimony of the lord iesus are suffered to lie in the streetes vnburied for three daies and an halfe that is for some short time which being expired the spirit of life comming from god shall enter into them and reuiue them then feare shall take their enimies but they shall ascend vp to heauen and their enemy shall see it all these doe plainly manifest god great mercie in giuing a gracious issue to the troubles of his childre yes by good experience we may see the truth heereof in the happy issue that the lord hath put to the most fearefull temptations of sundry in our time who haue beene exercised therein some for a yeare or two other for longer time euen many yeares together and yet in the end haue sung the song of ioyful deliuerance it may be some of god children beare the crosse to their dying day yet the lord sustains them in it by his grace and in the end shewes them mercy and peace secondly in this departure of satan from christ we may obserue a notable difference between the first adam and the second the first adam was tempted and ouercome therein satan preuailed in that conflict and brings him captiue into his kingdome hauing spiritually taken possession of him the second adam is tempted also but the diuell can find no meanes whereby to preuaile with him the prince of this world commeth but hath nought in mee saith christ john but after his assault is faine to flie away further in this departure of christ note two circumstances when satan departed and for how long a time first when he departed is noted in this word then that is after the third temptation when christ in indignation for his blasphemy against god had said auoid satan and withall had answered his temptation out of the written word then he departs hence we learne first that the best way to vanquish satain is to giue him no ground but to withstand him manfully at the first iam resist the diuell and he will flie now satan is resisted when from our hearts we cast our soules on the promises of god conteined in his word and in the whole course of our liues pray for strength of grace to stand against all his assaults whereby wee may see the great error and deceit of those who accompt of satans temptations as of fits of melancholie and thinke they may bee remooued by musicke merrie company and such like but these are no weapons to driue away the diuell secondly this also shewes their dangerous course who yeeld to satans temptations for a time taking their pleasure in their youth purposing to resist him when they are olde and then to repent too many take this course but it is fearefull for thus doing they set open al the doores of their heart to the diuel and suffer him to take quiet possession little considering that it is beyond their power to dispossesse him at their pleasure for indeed heereby they become like to a man that is sick of the dropsie who the more he drink the more he desires so hee that willingly giues place to satans temptation the more he sinnes the more he may for the longer he is tempted the more by yeelding is he weakened amp the greater is the danger of his endlesse confusion therefore learne of christ to resist betime secondly in this circumstance note that when christ rebuketh satan and bids him auoid hee departs and is presently gone was this any vertue in satan that hee doth thus readily depart at christs command no verily though he obey it is not praise worthy for obedience is two fould voluntary and constrained voluntary when the creature doth god command without compulsion thus adam did before his fail and all holy ones that are iustified and sanctified doe thus in part in this life constrained obedience is when the creature is made to obey god wil he nil he this is like to the obedience of rebels who being attached and arreigned for their treasons in suffering are made to obey the princes lawes and such was this obedience of satan forced vpon him by the powerfull command of christ who is prince and lord of all creatures and this is to be marked that when christ giues foorth his powerfull command then satan must obey whether he wil or not this is euident by his manifold dispossessions of vncleane spirits who came foorth at his command though they accompted him as their tormenter now that which heere befals the diuell shall one day bee verified of all wicked man if they will not now obey god willinglie while in the ministerie of the word he bids them repent and beleeue the gospell they shall one day bee compelled euen at the dreadful day of iudgement wil they nil they to obey that wofull voice of christ depart from mee yee cursed into euerlasting fire mat in regard whereof wee must euer be carefull now in the daie of grace to yeeld vnto christ voluntary and cheerefull obedience vnto all his commandements both of the law and gospell lest one day wee be constrained to obey in going to our endlesse wo satan who is a thousand fold stronger then man could not resist his power how then shall wee that are but dust and ashes stand before so great a god this circumstance of time is more fully noted by s luke saying luke and when the diuell had ended all the temptation he departed from him whereby thus much is signified that look what knowledge craft or power the diuel had that did he imploy to the vttermost in these temptations before he left our sauior christ whereby it appeareth that christ was tempted in the highest degree and measure that satan possibly could attain vnto herein did the diuell shew the extremity of his fraude and malice against christ which further appeares by this that the angels of heauen came and ministred vnto him for his comfort so as though satan could not taint the sacred heart of our sauior christ with the least spot of sin yet in these temptations christ was troubled with the same forrowes griefes amp vexations which god children vsually feele in their temptations the consideration whereof serues for speciall vse first to keepe all god children from despaire in the greatest extremity of their temptations euen when they shall feele their conscience as it were set on an iron racke and the slashings of hell fire alreadie kindled in their soule for christ iesus the head of the church was tempted by satan in the highest degree so as the angels came to minister comfort vnto him and yet he still remained the welbeloued son of god and so may any of god children remaine god deere elect euen then when the violence of satan shall seem most to preuaile against them secondly this teacheth vs to suppresse all rash iudgment in our selues of all such as shall bee exercised by satan in extreame temptations for oft it will fall out that the conscience of god child shall bee so exceedingly tormented in temptation that hee shall cry out he is forsaken of god and shalbe damned when as indeed he stil remains the deare child of god as christ our sauiour did god welbeloued in the deepest assaults of satan and therefore the relation published of francis spira his desperation doth inconsiderately taxe him for a cast away considering that nothing befel him in the time of his desperation but that which may befall the child of god yes our owne land can afford many examples which match francis spira whether we regard the matter of his temptation or the deepnesse of his desperation who yet through the mercy of god haue receiued comfort and therefore in this case christian charity must euer bind vs to thinke and speake the best lastly satans departing vpon the ending of these three temptations giues vs to vnderstand that howsoeuer the diuel abound with temptations of all sorts yet these three are the ground of all and the most principall temptations that satan hath for in this combate he did his worst amp shewed the violence of his rage and wrath and therefore it wil needfull for vs to take special notice of them as also of christs repulses giuen vnto them that so wee may be the better armed against them and the like thus much for the time when satan departed the second circumstance touching his departure is for how long the diuel left him noted by saint luke not for euer but for a season some may say we doe not find that satan tempted christ euer after this saue only vpon the crosse where he spotled principality and powers coloss answer the diuell tempts man two waies sometime by himselfe as he did our sauior christ in this place and vpon the crosse and our first mother eue in the garden gen sometime by man whom hee vseth as his instruments thus he tempted adam by eue and iob by the chaldeans and sabeans that robbed him and by his friends who sought to draw him from his integrity iob now though christ were not often after this tempted immediately by the diuel yet by satans instruments he was many times sore assaulted to the greefe of his heart as by the iewes the scribes and pharisies herod and pontius pilate who required signes of him mocked and persecuted him heere we may see a notable patterne of the state of god church amp children in this world for looke as christ their head is sore tempted and then let alone and yet but for a season being tempted againe by satans instruments so fareth it with them one while they are exercised with outward temptations and another while with inward assaults then through god mercy they haue freedome for a season but afterward satan comes vpon them againe either by himselfe or by his instruments which must teach vs wisdome in regard of the state of our own church in particular town that we must not dreame of a perpetuall freedome from trials and temptations howsoeuer through god mercie wee haue inioyed admirable peace and tranquillity for many yeares together for being a part of christs mystical body we must looke for the same condition with our head christ iesus who being sore tempted of satan was left but for a season and after tempted againe and therfore wee must resolue our selues vndoubtedly that trials will come what way god only knoweth but the winter of affliction will follow our haruest of ioy and peace and the yearely visitations by plagues amp famine are symptomes that is signes amp foretunners of more heauy iudgments vnlesse we prepare to meete our god in the practise of speedy and vnfained repentance and as this is the state of our church in generall so is it the particular condition of euery christian whose life is a continuall intercourse of trouble and peace and therefore euery child of god must be watchfull against security and with the end of one assault ioyne his preparation for a new this was the state of christ and the servant must not look to be aboue his master and thus much for the diuels departure the second part of the issue of this conflict is the ministery of the angels vnto christ and behold the angels come and ministred vnto him in saying behold the euangelist commends to our consideration the view of a great wonder to wit that that person whom the diuel would haue had to haue worshipped him is here worshipped and serued of the holy angels of god let no man therefore iudge of himselfe by that which satan would perswade him to in temptation christs estate doth now appeare farre different from that which satan would haue brought him to amp so shall all god children find it to bee with them after temptation if therein they fight manfully after the example of christ touching the ministerie of these angels here obserue three points first the bond that causeth the good angels to minister vnto christ secondly their number and thirdly the time of their ministery i point the bond of their ministery is christs soueraignety ouer the angels not onely as hee is god their creator but as hee is mediator god and man euen the man christ i say not the manhood of christ but christ as i may say the man god is lord of all angels and they doe him homage and seruice and though the man hood of christ be not lord of angels yet being receiued into the vnity of his god head it is thereby exalted aboue all angels by many degrees wherin we may behold the endlesse goodnesse of god in aduancing our nature which by sinne was made more vile then al earthly creatures far aboue the angels in degree by reason of this coniunction which it hath with the nature of god in the person of christ now as by this bond the angels are made ministers vnto christ so by vertue of the same they become ministers to all his true members iacobs ladder is thus expounded by our sauiour christ verily verily i say vnto you heereafter shall ye see heauen open and the angels of god ascending and descending vpon the son of man this son of man is christ who being god and man reacheth from heauen to earth and from earth to heauen to him the angels minister and by him they descend to minister to all the saints of god heere on earth the vse this teacheth vs to admire the endlesse goodnesse of god vnto his church and children not onely in bestowing heauen and earth vpon them but euen giuing his glorious angels to become ministring spirits for their protection defence amp comfort ii this their ministery must admonish vs to carry our selues reuerently and holily in all maner of conuersation if we were in the presence of an earthly prince oh how carefull would we be to our behauiour both for words amp actions much more then should the presence and attendance of god glorious angels who pitch their tents about vs if we be god children make vs circumspect to all our waies and the rather because their ministery is for our comfort and protection while wee keepe our selues in the straight waies of god ii point their number it is not said one angel but angels came and ministred vnto him indeed when hee was in his agonie in the garden a little before his passion luke one angell came and ministred comfort vnto him so that sometime one sometime moe attended on him euen as the euill spirits come to tempt sometime one alone as satan did heere to christ and somtimes moe as they did when he was vpon the crosse and as it befell christ so doth it to god children they haue somtime one good angell to attend vpon them and sometime many so likewise haue they sometime one euill spirit to assault them and somtimes many as the man in whom the legion was and heereby falleth to the ground this common opinion that euery man hath one good angell and one bad attending vpon him the one to protect him the other to tempt him but this opinion doth not wel stand with the tenour of the scripture which thus sets out the state of man in regard of his attendance by angels that there are somtimes moe about him and somtime fewer whether we speake of good angels or of euill spirits iii point the time when these good angels came and ministred vnto christ is noted in this word then that is when the diuel had done all he could against our sauiour christ they came not in the time of his assaults but when satan had ended his temptations and was gone there is no doubt but the good angels were alwaies about our sauior christ attending on his blessed person but at this time it is like they tooke vpon them some visible shape that so their ministery might be the more comfortable vnto him as it is like the diuel appeared in some shape for christs greater terrour in his temptations in this circumstance of time we may obserue a worke of god prouidence which he pleaseth to exercise in the time of temptation vpon his owne children to wit for a time to hide his mercy from them withdrawing the sensible feeling of his fauour thus he dealt with his beloued some christ iesus during the time of satans violent temptations he concealed from him the sensible assistance of the ministerie of his angels they shew not themselues till satan is departed and so fareth it many times with god deere children vpon whom he bestowes the good graces of his spirit as a nourcing mother to try the affection of her childe will sometime hid her selfe from it leaue it alone and suffer it to take a knocke or a fall so wil the lord leaue his children to themselues amp conceale from them the signes of his fauour suffering them to be buffered in temptation for a time that they may find thereby what they are in themselues without god grace and by feeling the bitternesse of that estate the more to hunger and thirst after his grace and fauour the more ioifully and thankfully to embrace it when it is renued and the more carefully to keepe it all the daies of their life what made dauid to accompt so highly of the courts of god house as that he esteemed the silly psalm birds happy that might build their nests by god altar but his banishment thence by the persecution of saul wherin hee was constrained to remaine in psalm meshech and to dwell in the tents of kedar and so when the people of god were in babell remembring zion they wept oh then ps let my right hand forget to play if i forget thee o serusalem let my tongue cleaue to the roofe of my mouth if i prefer not ierusalem to my chiefe ioy but vnto many this doctrine of temptations will seeme to small purpose nay altogether needlesse for that they neuer felt any such conflicts with the diuell they defie him from their harts and they trust to god neuer to be troubled with him this is the common estate of most man those onlie excepted who haue felt how hard a thing it is truly to repent and beleeue thus to blesse themselues in a carnall peace but sillie soules they know not their owne hearts nor the fearfull case in which they stand for all the true members of christ must be made conformable vnto their head now he was consecrated the prince of their saluation through afflictions heb his soule was heauie vnto the death before he could finish the worke of our life yes he is tempted by satan before he is comforted by the angels those therefore that were neuer tempted haue yet no fellowship in his afflictions they haue not begunne any conformitie with christ so as it is like they are still bondslaues vnto satan for if they had escaped out of his snare they should feele his assaults to get them in againe in regard heereof the childe of god is constrained to buckle hard with satan in temptation and to pray many a time to be deliuered from his buffeting and indeed howsoeuer for the present this be not ioyous yet they may count it exceeding great gladnesse as the iam apostle saith not onely for this triall of their faith which bringeth forth patience but also because herein they become like vnto christ in his humiliation which may giue them assurance that they shall be like him in glorie tim for if we be dead with christ we shall also liue with him and if we suffer we shall also raigne with him adde further that these man that neuer felt the assault of satan are as yet vnder a most fearfull iudgment of god in hardnesse of heart when christ sedde fiue thousand man with fiue loaues and two fish mark he distributed it by the hands of his disciples but after it is said they perceiued not this matter of the loaues and this reason is rendred because their harts were hardned verse and so it is with them that neuer feele the temptations of satan for he goeth about continually like a roaring lion seeking whom he may deuoure as they whose hearts are not hardned do well perceiue to conclude therefore let these man who yet neuer felt in themselues these assaults of satan vnfainedly endeuour to change the course of their liues by the practise of true repentance in eschewing euill and doing good let them giue themselues sincerely to the exercise of praier for the remouall of their stony hearts and the renuing vnto them hearts of flesh let them heare the word and doe the same and then they will shortly sing another song to wit that whosoeuer will liue godly in christ iesus must suffer temptations and be assaulted by the diuell and then will they finde that this doctrine is needfull yes they wil blesse god for this worke of

repentance is a worke of grace arising of a godly sorow wherby a man turnes fro all his sinnes unto god and brings foorth fruites worthie amendement of life i call repentance a work because it seemes not to be a qualitie or vertue or habit but an action of a repentant sinner which appeares by the ser mons of the prophets and apostles which runne in this tenor repent turne to god amend your lives ampc whereby they intimate that repentance is a worke to be done againe repentance is not every kinde of worke but a worke of grace because it can not be practised of any but of such as be in the estate of grace reasons are these i no man can repent unlesse he first hate sinne and loue righteousnes and none can hate sinne unlesse he be sanctified and he that is sanctified is iustified and hee that is iustified must needes haue that faith which unites him to christ and makes him bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh wherefore he that repentes is iustified and sanctified and made a member of christ by faith ii hee that turnes to god must first of all be turned of god and after that we are turned then we repent surely after i was converted i repented and after that i was instructed i smote upon my thigh i was ashamed yes even confounded because i did beare the reproch of my youth some may obiect that repentance goes before all grace because it is first preached the first sermon that ever was made was of repentance preached by god himselfe in paradise to our first parents and ever since the sermons of al the prophets and apostles and of all faithful ministers haue had repentance for their beginning and scope the answere hereto may be this if we respect the order of nature there be other graces of god which goe before repentance because a mans conscience must in some part be setled touching his reconciliatio with god jn christ before he can begin to repent wherfore iustificatio amp sanctification in order of nature go before repentace but if we respect time grace amp repentance are both togi ther so soone as there is fire so soone it is hot amp so soone as a man is regenerate so soone he repents if we respect the outward manifestation of these twaine repentance goes before all other graces because it first of all appeares outwardly regeneration is like the sap of the tree that lies hid within the barke repentance is like the bud that speedily shews itself before either blossom leaf or fruit appeare yes all other graces of the heart which are needfull to salvation are made manifest by repentance and for this cause repentance as i take it is first preached i adde further that repentace riseth of a godly sorow in the heart as paul teacheth godly sorow causeth repentance unto salvation never to be repented of it is called a godly sorow or a sorrow according to god that it may be distinguished from worldly sorrow which is a griefe arising of the apprehension of the wrath of god and other miseries as feare of man losse of good name calamities in goods and other things which in this life follow as punishments of sinne whereas the godly sorrowe causeth griefe for sinne because it is sinne and it makes any man in whome it is to be of this disposition and minde that if there were no conscience to accuse no devill to terrifie no iudge to arraigne and condemne no hell to torment yet he would be humbled amp brought on his knees for his sinnes because he hath offended a loving mercifull and long suffering god further i say that repentance standes in turning againe to god man at the first was made a goodly creature in the image of god having fellowshippe with him whereby hee dwelt in god and god in him by sinne there is a partition made betweene god and man who is alienated and estraunged from god and is become the child of wrath a firebrand of hell the prodigall child going from his father into a far countrey the straying nay the lost sheepe now when man haue grace to repent then they begin to renew this fellowship and turne againe to god and the very essence or nature of repentance consistes in this turning which paul doth seeme to intimate when he saith that he shewed both to iewe and gentile that they should repent and turne to god and doe workes worthy amendment of life in which wordes he sets downe unto us a full description of repentance againe i say that repentance is a turning from sinne because it doeth not abolish or change the substance of body or soule or any of the faculties thereof either in whole or parte but onely rectifie and amend them by remooving the corruption it turnes the sadnesse of melancholy to godly sorow choller to good zeale softnesse of nature to meekenesse of spirit madnesse and lightnesse to christian mirth it reformes every man according to his naturall constitution not abolishing it but redressing the faultes of it further i put downe that repentance is a turning from all sinne to god that i may exclude many false turnings the first when a man turnes from god to sinne as when one of a protestant becomes a papist an arrian a familist the second when a man turnes from one sinne to another as when the riotous person leaves his prodigalitie and gives himselfe to the practise of covetousnesse this can be no repentance because it is a going from one extreame to another whereas repentance is to leave the extreames and keepe the mean the thirde is not when a man turnes from sinne but sinne turnes from him and leaves him as when the drunkard leaves drunkennesse because his stomacke is decayed the fornicatour his uncleannesse because the strength of nature failes him the quareller his fighting because he is maimed on legge or arme the last is when man turne from many sinnes but will not turne from all as herod did many things at the advertisement of john baptist but coulde not be brought to leave incest in having his brother philips wife this repentance is nothing for as he which is truly regenerate is wholly in body soule amp spirit regenerate so he which truly repents turnes from all sinne and turnes wholly to god neither is this to trouble any that they can not know all their sinnes for sound repentace for one speciall sinne brings with it repentace of all sinne and as god requires particular repentance for knowen sinnes so he accepts a generall repentance for such as be unknown to proceed further the conversion of a sinner in repentance hath three partes the first a purpose and resolution in the mind the second an inclination in the will and affections the third an indeavour in life and conversation to abandon and leave all his former sinnes and to imploy himselfe in obedience to god commandements lastly this repentance must bring foorth fruites worthy amendement of life because it can not be knowen to be sincere vnlesse it bring forth fruit repentant sinners are trees of righteousnesse of god owne plant and they grow by the water that flow out of the sanctuarie and therefore they must beare fruite that may serve for meate and leafe for medecine otherwise the axe of god iudgement is laid to there rootes to stocke them vp the principall cause of repentance is the spirite of god as paul saith instructing them with meekenesse that are contrarie minded prooving if god at any time wil give them repentance and ieremie convert thou me and i shalbe converted the instrument of the holy ghost in working repentance is the ministerie of the gospell onely and not the law reasons hereof are these i faith is ingendred by the preaching not of the law but of the gospell as paul saith the gospell is the power of god to salvation to all that beleeve from faith to faith therefore repentance which followes faith as a fruite thereof must needes come by the preaching of the gospell only ii the lawe is the ministerie of death and damnation because it shewes a man his wretched estate but shewes him no remedie therfore it can not be an instrumentall cause of that repentance which is effectuall to salvation iii the doctrine of repentance is a part of the gospell which appeares in this that the preaching of repentance and the preaching of the gospell are put one for another and our saviour christ divides the gospell into two partes the preaching of repentance and remission of sinnes in his name iiii that part of the worde which workes repentance must reveale the nature of it and set out the promise of life which belongs unto it but the law neither reveales faith nor repentance this is a proper worke of the gospell if it bee said that the law is a schoolemaster to bring us to christ the answere is it brings man to christ a not by teaching the way or by alluring them but by forcing and urging them neither do we abolish the law in ascribing the worke of repentance to the gospell only for though it be no cause yet is it an occasion of true repentance because it represents unto the eye of the soule our damnable estate and smites the conscience with dolefull terrours and feares which though they be no tokens of grace for they are in their owne nature the very gates and the downe fall to the pit of hell yet they are certen occasions of receiving grace the phisition is otherwhiles constrained to recover the health of his patient by casting him into some fits of an ague so man because hee is deadly sicke of the disease of sinne he must be cast into some fittes of legall terrours by the ministerie of the law that he may recover his former estate and come to life everlasting repentance also is furthered by calamities iosephs brother when they were in distresse in egypt said one to another we have verily sinned against our brother in that we sawe the anguish of his soule when hee be sought vs and we would not heare him therefore is this trouble come upon vs and the lorde saith in oseah i will goe and returne to my place till they acknowledge their fault amp seeke me in their affliction will they seeke me diligently and the israelites say my soule had them namely afflictions in remembrance amp is humbled in me example of manasses and when hee was in tribulation hee prayed to the lord his god and humbled himselfe greatly and david saith it is good for me that i have ben afflicted that i might learne thy statutes repentance hath two parts mortification and rising to newnesse of life mortification is the first part of repentance which concernes turning from sinne man turn from sinne when they do not only abstaine fro actuall sinne but also use all means whereby they may both weaken amp suppresse the corruption of nature surgeons whe they must cut of any part of the body use to lay plai sters to it to mortifie it that beeing without sense and feeling it may be cut off with lesse paine in the same maner wee are to use all helpes amp remedies prescribed in the worde which serue to weaken or kill sinne that in death it may be abolished and it must not seeme strange that i say we must use meanes to mortifie our owne sinnes for howsoever by nature we can not doe ane thing acceptable to god yet being quickened and moved by the holy ghost we stirre and moove our selves to doe that which is truly good and therefore repentant sinners haue grace in them whereby they mortifie their owne sinnes paul saith i be at down my body and bring it in subiection and they which are christes haue crucified the flesh with the affections and the lustes thereof and mortifie therefore your earthly members fornication uncleannesse the inordinate affection evill concupiscence and covetousnesse and if any man purge himselfe from these he shall be a vessell unto honour and s john saith everyone which hath this hope in him purgeth him selfe even as hee is pure and he which is begotten of god preserveth himselfe and the wicked one toucheth him not mortification hath three partes a purpose in minde an inclination in will and an indeavour in life and conversation to leave all sinne rising to newnesse of life is the second part of repentance concerning sincere obedience to god and it hath also three partes the two first are a resolution in the minde and an inclination or lust in the will to obey god in all things barnabas exhorts them of antioch that with purpose of heart they would cleave vnto the lord examples of both these are many in scriptures of ioshua if it seeme evill vnto you to serve the lord chuse you this day whome yee will serve whether the god which your fathers served or the god of the amorites ampc but i and my housholde will serve the lorde of david o lorde thou article my portion i have determined to keepe thy commandements and i have sworne and will perfourme it that i will keepe thy righteous iudgements and when thou saidst seeke ye my face mine heart answered unto thee o lord i will seeke thy face and i have applyedmine heart to fulfill thy statutes alwayes even to the end the third parte is an indeavour in life and conversation to obey god example of paul and herein i take paines to have alwayes a cleare conscience towardes god amp towardes man of david i have respect vnto all thy commandements and i haue chosen the way of truth amp thy iudgements have i laid before me and i have cleaved to thy testimonies and direct me in the path of thy commandements for therein is my delight no man must here thinke that a repentant sinner fulfilles the lawe in his obedience for their best workes are faultie before god and whereas the faithfull in scriptures are said to be perfect we must know that there be two degrees of perfection perfection in substance and perfection in the highest degree perfection in substance is when a man doth sincerely indeavour to perfourme perfect obedience to god not in some but in all his commandements and this is the only perfection that any man can have in this life a christian mans perfection is to bewaile his imperfection his obediencee more consistes in the goodwill then in the worke and is more to be measured by the affection then by the effect repentance hath two degrees it is either ordinarie or extraordinary ordinary repentance is that which every christian is to per forme every day for as man fall daily either more or lesse so the graces of god are proportionally weakened day by day wherefore the continuall reparation therof must be made by a daily renuing of repentance a christian man is the temple amp house of god spirit hee must therfore once a day sweepe it that it may be sit to entertaine so worthy a ghest extraordinary repentance is the same in nature with the former it differs onely from it in degree and measure of grace and this is to be put in practise when man fall into any enormous capitall or grievous offences whereby they doe very grievously wound thir owne consciences amp giue great offence to the church of this sort was the repentace of peter when he went forth amp wept bitterly amp davids repentace after that he had committed adultery amp murdered vriah man be of two sortes the naturall man and the regenerate repentance is needefull for both for the naturall man that hee may be brought fro his sinnes and the image of god renewed in him some may say that many naturall man live civilly absteining from all outragious behaviour and therefore neede no repentance i graunt indeede they doe so yet repentance must goe withall for civil life without grace in christ is nothing else in god sight but a beautifull abomination the pharises were civill yet christ saith of them except your righteousnesse exceede the righteousnesse of the scribes and pharises yee shall not see the kingdome of heaven repentance is also required in the regenerate because they have many knowen and privie corruptions in them which must be mortified and otherwhiles they fall greevously and therefore that they may rise againe they must be daily practised in the spirituall exercises of repentance in the practise of repentance foure speciall duties are required the first is a diligent and serious examination of the consciece by the lawes amp commandementes of god for all manner of sinnes both originall and actuall example of the children of israel wherefore is the living man sorowfull man suffereth for his sinne let vs search amp trie our wayes amp turne againe to the lorde of david i considered my wayes amp turned my feete to thy testimonies touching originall sinne this must be well remembred that one man hath not one part onely of originall sinne and another man an other one man this corruption another that but every man as he received from adam the whole nature of man so also he received originall sinne wholly and therefore every man not one excepted saving christ who was extraordinarily sanctified by the holy ghost in the womb of the virgin hath in him from his parents the corruption and seede of all sinne which is a naturall disposition amp pronesse to commit any sinne whatsoeuer take a view and consider all the horrible sinnes that be practised in any part of the world either against the first or second table whatsoeuer they are the spawne and seede of them all is euen in that man that is thought to be best disposed by nature some may say that experiece shewes the contrary because among man that want all maner of religion some are more civill amp orderly some againe more lewdly disposed i answere that this comes to passe not because some man are by nature lesse wicked then others but because god by his providence doth limit and restraine mens corruption more or lesse which he doth for the good of mankind for if man might be wholly left to themselves corruption woulde so exceedingly breake out into all maner of sinnes that there should be no living in the world touching actuall sinnes they shalbe found by examinatio to be innumerable as the haires of a mans head amp as the sands by the sea shore if any will but search themselves a litle by the ten commandements of the decalogue for all their sinful thoughts words and deeds against god and man a

commandement he breakes this commandement he breakes this commandement he breakes this commandement he breakes this commandement he breakes this commandement he breakes this commandement he breakes this commandement he sinnes against the gospell thus much of examination now followes the second duty which is confession of sinne unto god which is very necessary for the right way to haue our sinnes covered before god is to uncover and acknowledge them unto him for hee will iustifie vs if we condemne our selues he will pardon us if we as being our owne enemy accuse our selues he forgets our sinnes if wee remember them when we are vile in our owne eyes wee are pretious in his and when we are lost to our selues we are found of him that confession may be rightly performed a notable duety is to be put in practise in it namely the arraignment of a repentant sinner whereby he iudges himselfe that he may not be iudged of the lord this arraignment hath three speciall pointes in it for first of all hee must bring himselfe forth to the barre of god iudgement which thing hee doeth when he sets himselfe in the presence of god as though even now the day of iudgement were as saint hierome did who alwayes thought with himselfe that hee heard this voice sounding in his eares rise yee dead and come to iudgement secondly he must put up an inditement against himselfe by accusing him selfe before god by acknowledging his knowne sinnes particularly and his unknowen generally without any excuse or extenuatio or defence or hiding of the least of them example of david i know mine iniquitie and my sinne is ever before me against thee against thee only have i sinned and done this evill in thy sight ampc behold i was borne in iniquitie and in sinne hath my mother conceived me and i have sinned greatly because i have done this thing but now i beg thee remoove the iniquitie of thy servant for i have done very foolishly of ezra o my god i am ashamed amp confounded to lift up mine eyes vnto thee my god for our iniquities are increased over our heads amp our trespasse is growen vp vnto heaven thirdly he must with heavinesse of heart give sentence against himselfe acknowledging that hee is worthy of everlasting hell death and damnation as the prodigall child father i have sinned against heaven amp against thee amp am not worthy to be called thy child and daniel wee haue sinned and committed iniquitie amp have done wickedly yes wee have rebelled amp have departed from thy precepts amp from thy iudgements ampc o lord righteousnesse belongeth vnto thee amp vnto vs open shame of iob beholde i am vile what shall i answere thee i will lay my hande upon my mouth and i abhorre my selfe amp i repent in dust amp ashes of the publicane who standing a farre off woulde not lift up so much as his eyes to heaven but smote his brest saying lord be mercifull to me a sinner as for confession of sinne to man it is not to be used but in two cases first when some offence is done to our neighbour secondly when ease and comfort is sought for in trouble of conscience the third dutie in the practise of repentance is deprecation whereby we pray to god for the pardon of the sinnes which haue bene confessed with contrition of heart with earnestnesse and constancie as for the weightiest matter in the world and here we must remember to behaue our selues to god as the poore prisoner doth at the barre who when the iudge is about to giue sentence cries unto him for favour as for life and death and we must doe as the cripple or lazar man in the way sit downe vnlappe our legges and armes and shew the sores of our sinnes crying to god continually as they doe looke with your eye and pity with your heart that wee may finde mercy at god handes as they get almes at the hands of passengers thus oseah instructeth the people o israel returne unto the lord thy god for thou hast fallen by thine iniquitie take unto you words and turne vnto the lord and say unto him take away all iniquitie and receive vs graciously so wee will render thee the calves of our lips of daniel wee doe not present our supplications before thee for our own righteousnes but for thy great tender mercies o lord heare o lord forgive o lord consider and doe it defer not for thine owne names sake o my god of david have mercy upon me o god according to thy loving kindnesse according to the multitude of thy compassions put away mine iniquities the last duty is to pray to god for grace amp strength whereby wee may be inabled to walke in newnesse of life of david behold i desire thy commandements quicken me in thy righteousnesse and teach me to doe thy will for thou article my god let thy good spirit lead me into the land of righteousnes motive to repentance are either legall or evangelical legall are such as are borrowed from the law amp they are especially the first is the misery and cursed estate of euery impenitent sinner in this life by reason of his sinnes his miserie that i may expresse it to the conceit of the simplest is seven fold within him before him behind him on his right hand on his left hand over his head vnder his feete his miserie within him is twofold the first is a guiltie conscience which is a very hell vnto the ungodly man for hee is like a silly prisoner and the conscience like a iayler which followes him at the heeles and dogges him whither soever he goes to the end he may see and observe all his sayings and doings it is like a register that sits alwaies with the pen in his hand to record and inrole all his wickednesse for everlasting memory it is a litle iudge that sittes in the middle of a man even in his very heart to arraigne him in this life for his sinnes as he shall be arraigned at the last iudgement therfore the pangs terror and feares of all impenitent persons are as it were certaine flashings of the flames of hell fire the guiltie conscience makes a man like him which lies on a bedde that is too strait and the covering too short who would with all his heart sleepe but can not belshazzar when he was in the middest of his mirth seeing the hand writing on the wall was smitten with great feare so as his countenance changed amp his knees smote togither the second evill within man is the fearefull slaverie and bondage vnder the power of satan the prince of darkenesse in that his mind will and affections are so knit and glued to the will of the devill that he can doe nothing but obey him amp rebell against god and hence satan is called the prince of this world which keepes the hold of the heart as an armed captaine keepes a sconse or a castle with watch and ward the misery before man is a daungerous snare which the devill layes for the destruction of the soule i say it is dangerous because he is in setting of it twentie or fortie yeres before he strikes when as god knowes man do little thinke of it it is made of three cords with the first he brings man into his snare and that he doeth by covering the miserie and the poyson of sinne and by painting out to the eie of the minde the deceitfull profit amp pleasures thereof with the second he hopples and insnares them for after that a man is drawen into this or that sinne the devill hath so sugered it over with fine delightes that he can not but needes must live and lye in it by the third he drawes the snare and indevours with all his might to breake the necke of the soule for when he seeth a fitte opportunitie especially in grievous calamities and in the houre of death he takes away the vizar of sinne and she weth the face of it in the true fourme as ouglie as him selfe then withall he beginneth as we say to shewe his hornes then he rageth in terrifying amp accusing that the soule of man may be swallowed up of the gulfe of finall despaire the miserie behinde him is the sinnes past the lord saith to cain if thou doest not well sinne lyeth at the doore where sinne is compared to a wilde beast which followes a man whither soever he goeth and lyeth lurking at his heels and though for a time it may seeme to be hurtlesse because it lyeth asleepe yet at length unlesse man repent it will rise up sease on them and rent out the very throtes of their soules iob in his afffliction saith thou writest bitter things against me and makest me possesse the sinnes of my youth and david prayeth forgive me the sinnes of my youth if the memorie of sinnes past be a trouble to the godly man oh what a racke what a gibbet wil it be to the heart of him that wants grace the miserie on the right hand is prosperitie and ease which by reason of mans sinne is an occasion of many iudgements in it man practised the horrible sinnes of sodome it puffes up the heart with divelish pride so as man shall thinke themselves to be as god him selfe as senacherib nebuchad nezzar antioch alexander herode domitian did it steales away mans heart fro god amp quenches the sparkes of grace as the lord complaineth of the israelites i spake unto thee when thou wast in prosperitie but thou saydest i will not heare this hath bene thy manner from thy youth it is like the ivie that embraces the tree and windes rounde about it but yet drawes out the iuice and life of it hence is it that many turne it to an occasion of their destruction salomon saith prosperitie of fooles destroyeth them when the milt swelles the rest of the body pines away and when the heart is puft with pride the whole man is in danger of destruction the sheepe that goes in the best pasture soonest comes to the slaughter house and the ungodly man fattes himselfe with continuall prosperity that he may the sooner come to his owne damnation the misery on the left hand is adversitie which stands in all manner of losses and calamities in goods friends good name and such like of this read at large deut the miserie over his head is the wrath of god which he testifies in all maner of iudgements from heaven in danger of which every impenitent sinner is every houre and the danger is very great the scripture saith it is a fearefull thing to fall into the hands of the living god he hath store houses full of all maner of iudgements and they watch for secure sinners that they can not scape god wrath is s a fire making havocke and bringing to nought whatsoeuer it lights on yes because he is slow to anger therefore more terrible as a man therefore stayes his hand for a time that he may lift it higher and fetch a deeper blowe when the dumb creatures melt as wax and vanish away at his presence when he is angry as the huge mountaines and rockes doe fraile man must never looke to stand if the roaring of a lyon make man afraid and the voice of thunder be terrible oh how exceedingly should all be astonished at the threatnings of god the misery under his feete is hell fire for every man till he repent is in as great danger of damnation as the traitour apprehended of hanging drawing and quartering a man walking in his way falles into a deepe dungeon that is full of vggely serpents and noisome beastes in his fall he catches hold of a twigge of a tree that growes at the mouth of the dungeon and hangs by it afterward there comes a beast both leane and hungerbitten which having cropt the whole tree is ever and anon knapping at the twigge on which he hanges nowe what is the daunger of this man surely he is like to fall into the pit over which he hangeth well this man is every impenitent sinner the pit is hell prepared for the devill and his angels the twig is the brickle and fraile life of man the hungerbitten beast is death that is ready every houre to knap our life asunder the dager is fearful for ma hanging as it were over the mouth of hel whe life is ended unlesse he use good meanes before he die he then falleth to the very bottome of it if this be the miserie wherewith the careles man is sieged amp copassed about every way amp that for his sinnes why do man lie in the dead sleepe of security it stands them in hand to take up the voice of bitter lamentation amp for their offences to howle after the manner of dragons if man could weepe nothing but teares of blood for their sins if they could dye a times in one day for very griefe they could never be grieved ynough for their sins the second motive to draw man to repentance is the consideration of the wretched estate of an impenitent sinner in his death which is nothing but the wages amp allowance that he receives for his sinne and it is the very suburbs or rather the gates of hel s paul compares death to a scorpion who carieth a sting in his taile which is sinne now then whe impenitent amp prophane persons die then comes this scorpion amp gripes them with her legs amp stabs them at the hart with her sting wherfore the best thing is before death come to use meanes to pull out the sting of death and nothing wil do it but the blood of christ let me therfore breake off their sinnes by repetace let the come to the throne of grace amp crie yes let them fil heaven amp earth with cries for mercy oh pray pray pray for the pardo of thy sinnes if thou obtaine but one drop of god speciall mercie in christ all danger is past for death hath lost his sting and then a man without danger may put an ougly serpet in his bosom the third motive is the consideration of his estate after death when the day of the last judgement shalbe he must be brought and set before the tribunal seat of christ he shal not be able to escape or hide himself then the bookes shalbe brought out amp all his sins shalbe discovered before god saints amp angels the devil amp his own conscience shal accuse him none shall be aduocate to plead his cause hee himselfe shall be speechlesse hee shall at length heare the dreadfull sentence of damnation goe ye cursed into hell prepared for the divell amp his augels this thing might moove the vilest athiest in the world to leaue his wicked wayes and come to amendement of life wee see the strongest theefe that is when he is ledde in the way from the prison to the barre leaves his theeving and behaues himselfe orderly and indeed if hee woulde then cut a purse it were high time that he were hanged all man by nature are traitours and malefactours against god whiles we live in this worlde wee are in the way going to the barre of god iudgement the wheele of the heavens turnes one bout every day and winds up somwhat of the threed of our life whether wee sleepe or wake we are alwayes comming neerer our end wherfore let all man daily humble themselues for their sinnes and pray vnto god that he would be reconciled unto them in christ and let them indeavour themselves in obedience to all god commandements both in their lives and callings againe after the last iudgement there remains death eternal appointed for him which standes in these three things i a separation from all ioy and comfort of the presence of god ii eternall fellowship with the divell and all his angels iii the feeling of the horrible wrath of god which shall seaze upon bodie soule and conscience amp shall feed on them as fire doth on pitch and brimstone and torment them as a worme crawling in the bodie and gnawing on the heart they shall alwaies be dying and never deade alwayes in woe and neuer in ease and this death is the more grievous because it is euerlasting suppose the whole worlde to be a mountaine of sande and that a birde must carrie from it a mouthfull of sand euerie thousande yeeres many innumerable thousands of yeres will be expired before she will haue caried away the whole mountaine well if a man should stay n torment so long and then haue an ende of his woe it were some comfort but when the bird shall haue caried away the mountaine a thousand times alas alas a man shall be as far from the ende of his anguish and torment as ever he was this consideration may serve as an iron scourge to drive man from their wicked lives chrysostom would have man in their meetings in tavernes and feastes to talke of hel that by often thinking on it they might avoyde it a grave and chaste matrone being mooved to commit folly with a lewd ruffian after long discourse she called for a panne of burning coales requesting him for her sake to holde his finger in them but one houre he answered that it was an unkinde request to whome she replyed that seeing he would not holde so much as one finger in a fewe coales for one small houre she could not yeeld to do the thing for which she should be tormented body amp soule in hell fire for ever and so shold all man reason against themselves none will be brought to doe a thing that may make so much as their finger or tooth to ake therefore we ought to have great care to leave our sinnes whereby we bring endlesse torment to bodie and soule in hell evangelical motive are two especially the first is taken from the consideration of mans redemption he that redeemed mankind is god him selfe as paul saith that god was in christ reconciling the world to him selfe mans sinne is so vile and hainous in the eyes of god that no angell nor creature was able to appease the wrath of god for the least offence but the son of god himselfe must come downe from heaven and take mans nature on him and not onely that but he must also suffer the most accursed death of the crosse and shed his most pretious heart blood to satisfie the justice of his father in our behalfe if a father should be sicke of such a disease that nothing would heale but the heart blood of his owne childe he would presently judge his owne case to be dangerous and would also vowe if ever he recovered to use all meanes whereby he might avoid that disease so likewise seeing nothing could cure the deadly wound of our sinne but a plaister made of the heart blood of christ it must make us acknowledge our pitifull case and the hainousnesse of the least of our sinnes and stirre us up to newnesse of life againe considering the end of the redemption wrought by christ was to deliuer us from our euill conuersation in sinne and unrighteousnesse we are not to continue and as it were lie bathing our selues in sinne for that were as if a prisoner after that he had bin ransomed and had his boltes taken of and were put out of the prison to go whither he would should returne againe and desire to lie in the dungeon still the second motive is that god hath made a promise to such as truly repent i of remission of sinnes wash you make you cleane take away the evill of your workes from before mine eyes cease to doe evill ampc though your sinnes were as crimsin they shall be made a white as snow though they were red like scarlet they shal be as wooll and seeke the lorde while he may be found call upon him while he is neere let the wicked for sake his wayes amp the vnrighteous his own imaginations amp returne vnto the lord and he will have mercie on him for hee is very plentifull in forgiving ii of life everlasting i will not the death of a sinner but rather that hee repent and live and thus saith the lord vnto the house of israel seeke yee me amp ye shall live iii of mitigating or remooving temporall calamities stand in the courte of the lordes house amp speake vnto all the cities of iudah ampc if so be they will hearken and turne every man from his evill way that i may repent me of the plague which i have determined to bring upon them because of the wickednesse of their workes as god hath made these mercifull promises to penitent sinners so he hath faithfully perfourmed them so soone as they have but begun to repent exaple of david then david said to nathan i have sinned against the lord and nathan said to david thy sinne is forgiven thee of manasses when he was in tribulation he prayed vnto the lord his god amp humbled him selfe greatly before the lord god of his fathers and prayed unto him an god was intreated of him amp heard his prayer of the publicane the publicane ampc smot his breast saying o god be mercifull to me sinner i tell you this man departed iustified t his house rather then the other of the thiefe he said unto iesus lord remember me when thou commest to thy kingdome then iesus sai unto him verely i say unto thee to day shall thou be with me in paradise having such notable promises made to repentance no man is to drawe backe from the practise of it because of the multitude o his sinnes but rather to doe it the pharise said to christs disciples why eates your master with publicanes and sinners when iesu heard it he said unto them the whole need no the phisition but they that are sicke and i am come not to call the righteous but sinners to repentance and verely i say unto you that publicanes and harlots shall goe before you into the kingdome of god the time of repentance is the time present without any delay at all as the holy ghost saith to day if ye will heare his voyce and exhort one another daily while it is called to day lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfullnesse of sinne reasons hereof are these i life is uncerten for no ma knowes at what houre or moment amp after what manner he shall goe forth of this world be ye also prepared therefore for the son of man wil come at an houre when ye thinke not this one thing should make a man to hasten his repentance and the rather because many are dead who purposed with them selves to repent in time to come but were prevented by death and shall never repent ii the longer a man lives in any sin the greater danger because by practise sin gets heart amp stregth custome is of such force that that which man use to do in their life time the same they doe and speake when they are dying one had three pounds owing to him to be paid three seuerall yeres when he was dying nothing could be got of him but three yeres three pounds againe by deferring repentance man treasure up wrath against the day of wrath as if a malefactour for his punishment should be appointed to cary every day a sticke of wood to an heape to burne him twentie yeeres after iii the more the time is prolonged the harder it is to repent the longer a man goes in his sicknesse without phisicke the harder is the recoverie and where the devill dwells long hee will hardly be remooved the best way to kill a serpent is to cruse it in the heade when it is young iiii it is as meat and drinke to the devill to see man liue in their sinnes deferring repentance as on the contrary there is great ioy among the angels of god in heaven when a sinner doth repent v late repentance is seldome or never true repentance for if a man repent when he cannot sinne as in former time as namely in death then hee leaves not sinne but sinne leaves him wherefore the repentance which man frame to them selues when they are dying it is to be feared least it die with them and it is very iust that hee should be contemned of god in his death who contemned god in his life chrysostom sayeth that the wicked man hath this punishment on him that in dying hee shoulde forget himselfe who when hee was living did forget god vi we are with abel to giue unto god in sacrifice even the fatte of our flocke now they which deferre repentance to the end do the contrary late repenters offer the flower of their youth to the deuill and they bring the lame and broken sacrifice of their old age to god whether a man that hath professed christ and his religion yet afterwarde in persecution denies christ and forsweares the religion may repent and be saved answere it is a grievous estate yet a man may come to repentance afterward manasses fell away to idolatry and witchcraft and yet was received to mercie so did wise salomon and yet no doubt recovered and is received to life everlasting my reason is because god vouchsafed him to be a pen man of some parts of holy scripture and the sctiptures were written not by such as were man of god only but by such as were holy man of god peter denyed christ of knowledge against his owne conscience and that with cursing and banning and yet came to repentance afterward as appeares by the testimony of christ i have prayed for thee that thy faith faile not therefore when thou article converted strengthen thy brother obiect i matth whosoever shall denie me before man him will i denie before my father which is in heaven answere the place is only to be understood of such a deniall of christ which is finall obiect ii hebr it is impossible that they which were once lightened and haue tasted of the heavenly gift ampc if they fall away should be renewed by repentance and heb if we sinne willingly after that we have received the knowledge of the truth there remaines no more sacrifice for sinne answere these places must be understood of the sinne which is to death in which man of desperate mallice against christ vniuersally and wholly fall away from religion for the holy ghost saith not if they fall but a if they fall away and it is added that they crucifie the son of god and make a mocke of him that they trample vnder foote the son of god that they accompt the blood of the new testament an unholy thing that they despise the spirit of god and the word translated a willingly imports somewhat more namely to sinne because a man will that is wilfully whether the child of god after repentance for some grievous sin do fall into the same again amp come to repentance the second time answere the case is daungerous as we may see by comparison in the body if one fall into the relapse of an ague or any other stronge disease it may cost him his life and the recovery will be very hard christ said to the man that had bene sicke yeeres after that he had healed him beholde thou article whole sinne no more lest a worse thing befall thee and the unclean spirit returning takes to him other seven spirits worse then himselfe indeed we finde no particular example of recovery after a relapse in the scriptures yet no doubt a recovery may be reasons are these i promise is made of remission of sinnes in christ without any tearme of time without any limitation to any number or kindes of sinne saue only the blasphemie against the holy ghost therfore there may be repentance and salvation after a relapse ii christ tells peter that he must forgiue not till seven times only which peradventure hee thought to be very much but seventy seven times and that in one day if one returne seventie times and say it repents me now if wee must doe this which haue not so much as a drop of mercie in us in comparison of god he will no doubt often forgive even for one sinne if man will returne and say it repents me considering that with him is plentifull redemption and he is much in sparing whether he that repents is to make restitution if hee haue taken any thing wrongfully from his neighbour answere yes zacheus when he repented and received christ gaue halfe of his goods to the poore and if he had taken any thing by forged cavillation he restored it foure fold it is but a badde practise when a man on his death bedde will very devoutly bequeath his soule to god and his goods euill gotten as his conscience will often cry in his eare to his children and friends without either restitution or amends making question but what if a man be not able to restore answere let him acknowledge the fault and god will accept the will for the deed as paul saith in the like case if there be a willing minde it is accepted according to that which a man hath amp not according to that he hath not question when a man by restoring shall discredit him selfe how shall he both restore and keepe his credite answere let him if the thing to be restored be of small moment make choise of some faithfull and honest frend who may deliver the thing in the behalfe of the partie concealing his name whether doeth repentance alwayes go with teares or not answer no for very pride and hypocrisie will draw foorth teares for some there are that can weepe for their sinnes in the presence of others whereas being alone they neither will nor can some againe are of that constitution of body that they haue teares at commaund and a godly man with drie cheekes may mourne to god for his sinnes and intreat for pardon and receive it yet in all occasions of deeper griefe for sinne teares will follow unlesse man haue stony and flinty hearts and yet againe though the greatest cause of sorow be offered the softest heart that is sheds not teares at the first but afterward it will when the body receiues a deepe wound at the first yee shall see nothing but a white line or dint made in the flesh without any blood stay but a while then comes blood from the wound in great aboundance so at the first the mind is astonished and gives no teares but after some respit and consideration teares follow whether the repentant sinner can alwayes shevve him selfe comfortable on his death bedde answere though the comfort of god spirite shall never be abolished from his heart yet hee can not alwayes testifie it for he may die of a burning ague and by reason of the extremitie of his fits be troubled with idlenesse of head and breake out into raving speeches amp blasphemies likewise hee may die of sicknesse in the braine and be troubled with grievous convulsions so as his mouth shall be writhen to his eares his necke turned behind him and the very place where he lyes shall shake through his trembling as daily experience will testifie neither is any to thinke this strange for salomon saith all things in outward matters come alike to all amp the same condition is to the iust amp to the wicked to the good and to the pure and to the polluted and to him that sacrificeth and to him that sacrificeth not contrarie to repentance is impenitencie whereby man continue in one estate neither sorowing for sinne nor turning from it it is one of the most grievous iudgements that is if it be finall for as a sick man then is most sicke when he feeles the lest sicknesse amp saith he is well so miserable man is in most misery when he feeles no misery and thinks himselfe in good estate this sin befalls them that iudge themselves righteous needing no repentance as the pharises in the daies of christ the catharists in the primative church amp the anabaptistes in our age adde unto these such as haue hardened their hearts so as they can not discerne between good and euill nor tremble at god iudgements but rather fret and rage against them till god in his wrath either destroy them or cast them to finall despaire as it befell iulian the apostata who died blaspheming and casting his own blood into the aire between the two extremes repentance amp impenitencie is placed counterfeit repentance for the wicked nature of man can dissemble amp counterfeit god grace as the lord complains of the iewes her rebellious sister iudah hath not returned vnto me with her whole heart but fainedly saith the lord ierem counterfeit repentance is either ceremoniall or desperate ceremonial when man repent in outward shew but not in the truth of heart as saul then said saul to samuel i haue sinned for i haue transgressed the commandements of the lord amp thy words because i feared the people amp obeyed their voice now therfore i pray thee take away my sin amp turn again with me that i may worship the lord ampc again i haue sinned but honour me i pray thee before the el ers of my people of ahab when ahab heard these words e rent his cloth and put on sackcloath amp fasted amp went softly and the word of the lord came to elijah saying seest thou how ahab is humbled before me dissembled repentance may be discerned because man after a time returne to their old byas againe pharao king of egypt said unto moses amp aaron pray unto the lord that he may take away the frogges from me amp from my people and when egipt was smitte with haile he saide i have now sinned and the lorde is righteous but i and my people are wicked pray ye unto the lord that there be no more mighty thunders and baile againe troubled with grashoppers he said i have sinned against the lord your god and against you and now forgive me my sinne onely this once ampc now marke the issue of all when pharao saw that he had rest given him he hardened his heart and harkened not unto them as the lorde had said this is the ordinary amp common repentance that most man practise in the world desperate repentance is when a man hauing only god iudgements before his eyes is smitten with horrour of conscience amp wanting assurance of god mercy despaires finally this was iudas repentance who when he had brought again the peeces of silver confessed his fault amp went and hanged himselfe the church of rome at this day hath corrupted the ancient doctrine of repentance being one of the speciall points of religion the corruptions are specially sixe the first that they make repentance or penance to be a sacrament which can not be because it wants an outward signe and though some say that the words which the priest rehearseth in absolution are the signe yet that can not be because the signe must be not only audible but also visible the second that a sinner hath in him a naturall disposition which being stirred up by god preventing grace he may and can work togither with god spirit in his owne repentance but indeed all our repentance is to be ascribed to god grace wholly the soule of man is not weak but starke dead in sinne amp therefore it can no more prepare it selfe to repentance then the body being dead in the grave can dispose it self to the last resurrectio the third corruption that contrition in repentance must be sufficient a thing impossible for sinne doth so greatly offend god maiesty that no man can ever mourne enough for it the fourth that contrition doth merit remission of sinne an opinion that doth derogate much from the all sufficient merites of christ the fift that he that repents must confesse all the sinnes that he can remember with all their circumstances to his owne priest or one in his stead if he will receive pardon this kind of confession is a mere forgery of mans brain i there is neither precept nor example of it in the scriptures ii david and others haue repented and haue receiued remission of their sinnes without confessing of their sinnes in particular to any man the last that the sinner by his workes and sufferings must make satisfaction to god for the temporall punishment of his sinnes a flat blasphemie the scriptures mention no other satisfaction but christs and if his be sufficient ours is needlesse if ours needful his imperfect papists write that both may stand togither christs satisfaction they say is as a plaister in a boxe unapplyed mans satisfaction as a meanes to apply it because it prepares us to receiue it ah good divinity for euen in common sense the satisfaction of christ must first be applyed to the person of man that it may please god before the workes which they terme satisfactions can any way be acceptable to god to conclude the roman doctrine of repentance is the right way to hell for when a sinner shall be taught that he must haue sufficient sorow for his sinne and withall that he must not beleeue the remission of his owne sinnes particularly when sorow comes upon him and he wants sound comfort in god mercy he must needs fall into desperation without recovery therfore the papists in the houre of death as we haue experience are glad to leaue the trumpery of humane satisfactions and to rest only for their iustification on the obedience of christ the apostle paul from the beginning of this chapter to the verse exhorts the galatians to maintaine their christian liberty amp fro thece to the end of the chapter he perswades the to other speciall duties of godlines in the verse he stirs them up to be serviceable one to another by loue in the verse he disswades them fro contentions amp doing of iniuries in the verse he shewes the remedy of the former sinnes which is to walk according to the spirit in this seventeenth verse he renders a reason of the remedie the force whereof is this the flesh and the spirit are contrary wherfore if ye walke according to the spirit it will hinder the flesh that it shall not carry you forward to do iniuries amp liue in contentions as otherwise it would in this verse we haue to obserue points the first that there is a combat betwene the flesh amp the spirit in these words the flesh lusteth against the spirit and the spirit against the flesh the second is the maner of this combat which stands in the contrary lusting of the flesh and the spirit the third is the cause of the combat in these words and these are contrary the fourth is the subiect or person in who this combat is noted in these words so that yee the galatians the last is the effect of the cobat in the last words that they canot do ampc touching the combat it selfe diverse points are to be cosidered the first what these two which make combat namely the flesh and the spirit are they haue diverse significations first of all the spirit is taken for the soule and the flesh for the body but so they are not taken in this place for there is no such combat betwene the body amp the soule both which agree togither to make the person of one man secondly the spirit signifies naturall reason amp the flesh the natural appetite or concupiscence but they canot be so understood in this place for the spirit here mentioned doth fight euen against naturall reason which though it serue to make a man without excuse yet is it an enemy to the spirit thirdly the spirit signifies the godhead of christ and the flesh the manhood but it must not be so taken here for then euery man regenerate should be deified lastly the spirit signifies a created quality of holines which by the holy ghost is wrought in the mind will amp affections of man amp the flesh the naturall corruption or inclination of the mind will and affections to that which is against the law in this first these twain are taken in this place secondly it is to be considered how these twain the flesh amp the spirit can fight togither being but mere qualities and we must know that they are not severed asunder as though the flesh were placed in one part of the soule amp the spirit in another but they are ioyned amp mingled togither in al the faculties of the soul the mind or understanding part is not one part flesh and an other spirit but the whole mind is flesh and the whol mind is spirit partly one and partly the other the whole will is partly flesh and partly spirit the flesh and the spirit that is grace and corruption not seuered in place but distinguished as the aire in the dawning of the day is not wholly light or wholly darke as at midnight and at nooneday neither is it in one part light in another part darke but the whole aire is partly light and partly dark throughout in a vessell of lukewarme water the water it selfe is not onely hot or only cold or in one part hot amp in another part cold but heat and cold are mixt togither in every part of the water so is the flesh and the spirit mingled togither in the soule of man and this is the cause why these two contrary qualities fight togither thirdly in this combate we are to consider what equality there is betweene these two combaters the flesh and the spirit and we must know that the flesh usually is more in measure then the spirit the flesh is like the mighty gyant goliah and the spirit is litle and small like young david hence it is that paul calls the corinthians which were man iustified and sanctified carnall i could not saith he breethren spkake unto you as unto spirituall but as unto carnall as unto babes in christ and none can come to be tall man in christ according to the age of the fulnesse of christ till after this life and the speech which is used of some divines that the ma regenerate hath but the reliques of sin in him must be understood warily els it may admit an untruth as for the measure of grace it can be but smal in respect whereas we do receiue but the first fruites of the spirit in this life amp must wait for the accomplishment of our redemptio till the life to come for all this the power amp efficacy of the spirit is such that it is able to prevaile ordinarily against the flesh for the flesh receiues his deadly wound at the first instant of a mans conuersion and continually dyeth after by litle amp litle amp therfore it fights but as a maimed soldier and the spirit is continually confirmed amp increased hy the holy ghost also it is liuely amp stirring amp the vertue of it is like musk one graine wherof wil giue a stronger smell the many unces of other perfumes some may say that the godly man doth more feele the flesh then the spirit amp therfore that the flesh is euery way more then the spirit i answer that we must not measure our estate by feeling which may easily deceiue us a man shall feele a paine which is but in the top of his finger more sensibly then the health of his whol body yet the health of the body is more the the pain of a fingar secondly we feele corruption not by corruption but by grace amp therfore man the more they feele their inward corruptions the more grace they haue thus much of the combat it selfe now let us come to the maner of this fight it is fought by lusting to lust in this place signifies to bring forth amp to stir up motions amp inclinations in the hart either to good or evil lusting is twofold the lusting of the flesh amp the lusting of the spirit the lusting of the flesh hath two actions the first is to ingender euill motions amp passions of selfe loue envy pride unbeliefe anger ampc s iames saith that man are enticed and drawen away by their own concupiscece now this inticing is only by the suggestion of bad cogitations amp desires this action of the flesh made paul say that he was carnall solde under sinne the second action of the flesh is to hinder amp quench amp overwhelm all the good motios of the spirit paul found this in himselfe when he said i see another law in my members rebelling against the law of the mind amp leading me captive to the law of sinne by reason of this action of the flesh the man regenerate is like to one in a slumber troubled with the disease called ephialtes or the mare who thinks that he feeles something lying on his breast as heavy as a mountaine amp would faine haue it away wherupon he striues amp labours by hads and voice to remoue it but for his life can not doe it on the contrary the lusting of the spirit containes two other actions the first is to beget good motions inclinations amp desires in the mind will amp affections of this david speaketh myreines teach me in the night season that is my mind affection and will and my whole soule being sanctified and guided by the spirit of god do minister unto me consideratios of the way in which i ought towalk isaias prophecying of the church of the new testament saith when a ma goeth to the right hand or to the left he shal he are a voice saying here is the way walke ye in it which voice is not only the outward preaching of the ministers but also the inward voice of the spirit the second action of the spirit is to hinder aud suppresse the bad motions and suggestions of the flesh s john saith he that is borne of god sinneth not because his seed remaineth in him that is grace wrought in the heart by the holy ghost which resisteth the rebellious desires of the flesh that the manner of this fight may more clearely appeare we must examine it more particularly in the soule of man there be two speciall parts the mind and the will in the mind there is a double combat the first is betweene knowledge of the word of god and naturall ignorance or blindnes for seeing we doe in this life knowe but in part therefore knowledge of the truth must needs be ioyned with ignorance in all that are inlightned amp one of these being contrary to an other they striue to ouershadow and ouercast ech other hence we may learn the cause why excellet divines do vary in diverse points of religio and it is because in this cobat naturall blindnes yet remaining prevailes more or lesse man that are dim sighted amp cannot discerne without spectacles if they should be set to discry a thing a far off the most of them would be of diverse opinions of it and man inlightened amp regenerate in this life do but see as in a glasse darkly again this must teach all studets of divinity often to suspect themselues in their opinions and defences seeing in them that are of soundest iudgemet the light of their understanding is mixed with darknes of ignorace and they can in many points see but as the man in the gospell who when our saviour christ had in part opened his eyes saw man walking not as man but in the forme of trees also this must teach all that read the scriptures to invocate amp cal upo the name of god that he wold inlighten the by his spirit amp abolish the mist of natural blindnes the prophet david was wor thily inlightned with the knowledge of god word so as he excelled the ancient and his owne teachers in wisdom yet being privy to himselfe touching his owne blindnes often prayeth in the psalms inlighten my eyes that i may vnderstand the wonders of thy law by reason of this fight when naturall blindnes prevailes the child of god truly inlightened with knowledge to life everlasting may erre not only in lighter points but euen in the very foundation of religion as the corinthians amp the galathians did and as one man may erre so an hundred man may also yes a whole particular church and as one church may erre so an more may for in respect of this combat the estate and condition of all man is alike whence it appeares that the church militant upo earth is subiect to error but yet as the diseases of the body be of two sorts some curable and some incurable which are to death so likewise errours are and the church though it be subiect to sundry fals yet it can not erre in foundation to death the errours of god children be curable some may here say if all man amp churches be subiect to errour then it shall not be good to ioyne with any of them but to separate from them all i answer though they may and do erre yet we must not separate from them so long as they do not separate from christ the second combat in the mind is between faith amp unbeliefe for faith is imperfect and mixt with the contrary unbeliefe presuming doubting ampc as the man in the gospell saith lord i beleeve help mine unbeliefe by reason of this fight when unbeliefe preuailes the very child of god may fal into fits amp pangs of dispaire as iob amp david in their teptations did for david once considering the prosperity of the wicked brake out into this speech certenly i have clensed mine heart in vaine amp washed mine hands in innocencie yes this dispaire may be so extreme that it shal weake the body amp consume it more then any sicknes no man is to think this strange in the child of god for though he dispaire of his election amp saluation in christ yet his desperatio is neither total nor final it is not totall because he doth not dispaire with his whol heart faith euen at that instant lusting against dispaire it is not finall because he shall recouer before the last end of his life to proceed the combat in the will is this the will partly willeth and partly nilleth that which is good at the same instant amp so likewise it willeth amp nilleth that which is evill because it is partly regenerate amp partly unregenerate the affections likewise which are placed in the wil partly imbrace amp partly eschew their obiects as loue partly loueth and partly doth not loue god and things to be loued feare is mixed amp not pure as schooleme haue dremed but partly fili l partly servil causing the child of god to stad in awe of god not only for his mercies but also for his iudgements amp punishments the will of a man regenerate is like him that hath one leg sound the other lame who in every step which he makes doth not wholly halt or wholly go upright but partly go upright amp partly halt or like a man in a boate on the water who goeth upward because he is caried upward by the vessell amp at the same time goes downward because hee walkes downward in the same vessell at the same instant if any shall say that contraries ca not be in the same subiect the answer is that they ca not if one of them be in his full stregth in the highest degree but if the force of them both be delaied amp weakned they may be ioyned togither by reason of this cobat whe corruption prevails against grace in the wil amp affectios there ariseth in the godly a certain deadnes or hardnes of heart which is nothing els but a wat of sense or feeling some may say that this is a fearfull iudgement but the answer is that there be kinds of hardnes of heart one which possesseth the heart amp is never felt this is in them who haue their cosciences seared with an hot iron who by reason of custome in sin are past all feeling who likewise despise the meanes of softning their harts and indeed this is a fearful iudgement there is another hardnes of heart which is felt amp this is not so dangerous as the former for as we feele our sicknes by contrary life amp health so hardnes of hart when it is felt argues quicknes of grace amp softnes of hart of this dauid often coplained in the psalmes of this the childre of israel speak when they say why hast thou hardned our harts fro thy waies thus much of the maner of the c mbate in particular before we proceed any further let us mark the issue of it which is this the spirit prevailes against the flesh at two times in the course of a mans life and at his end but yet with some foiles receiued i say the spirit prevails not in one instant but in the whol course of a mans life so s john saith he which is begotten of god sinneth not for he preserveth himselfe the grace of god in his heart ordinarily prevailing in him and paul makes it the property of the regenerate man to walk according to the spirit which is not now amp then to make a step forward but to keep his ordinary course in the way of godlines as in going from barwick to london it may be a man now and then will go amisse but he speedily returnes to the way againe amp his course generally shall be right again the spirit prevails in the end of a mas life for then the flesh is utterly abolished amp sanctification accoplished because no uncleane thing can enter into the kingdom of heaven this further must be conceived that when the spirit prevailes it is not without resistance amp striving as paul testisieth i do not the good which i would but the evill which i would not that do i which place is not to be understood only of thoughts amp inward motions as some would haue it nor of particular offences but of the generall practise of his duty or calling through the whol course of his life and it is like the practise of a sickman who having recovered of some grieuous disease walkes a turn or twain about his chamber saying ah i would fain walk up and down but i cannot meaning not that he can not walke at all but signifying that he cannot walke as he would being soone wearied through faintnesse i added further that this prevailing is with foyles a foile is when the flesh for the time vanquisheth amp subdueth the spirit in this case the man regenerate is like a soldier that with a blow hath his brain pan cracked so as he lyes groueling astonished not able to fight or like him that hath a fit of the falling sicknes who for a time lies like a dead man hence the question may be mooued whether the flesh preuailing doth not extinguish the spirit amp so cut off a man from christ till such time as he be ingrafted again the answer is this there be two sorts of christians one who doth only in shew amp name professe christ amp such an one is no otherwise a member of christs mystical body then a wooden leg set to the body is a meber of the body the second is he that in name amp deed is a liuely part amp meber of christ if the first fall he canot be said to be cut off because he was never ingrafted if the secod fall he may be amp is cut off from christ but marke how he is not wholly cut of but in some part namely in respect of the inward fellowship amp communio with christ but not in respect of coniunctio with him a mans arme take with the dead palsie hangs by amp receives no heate life or sense fro the rest of the members or fro the head yet for all this it remains still united amp coupled to the body amp may again be recovered by plaisters amp phisicke so after agrievous fall the childe of god feeles no inward peace and comfort but is smitten in conscience with tbe trembling of a spirituall palsie for his offence and yet indeed remaines before god a member of christ which shall be restored to his former estate after serious repentance and god permits these foiles for weighty causes first that man might be abashed amp confounded in theselves with the consideratio of their vile natures amp learne not to swell with pride because of god grace paul saith that after he had bin rapt into the third heaven the angell satan was sent to buffet him and as we said to beat him black amp blew that he might not be exalted out of measure the secod that we may learn to deny our selues amp cleaue unto the lord fro the bottom of our hearts paul saith that he was sick to death that he might not trust in him selfe but in god who raiseth the dead thus much of the maner of the combate now followes the cause of it the cause is the contrariety that is between the flesh and the spirit as paul saith the wisdome of the flesh is enmitie to god hece we are taught that since the fall there is no free wil in ma in spiritual matters cocerning either the worship of god or life everlasting for flesh is nothing els but our naturall dispositio amp ma is nothing els but flesh by nature for the spirit comes afterward by grace amp yet flesh is flat contrary to the spirit which makes us do that which is pleasing unto god wherfore the wil naturally is a flat bodslaue unto sin again hence we may learne that it is not an easie matter to practise religio which is to liue according to the spirit to which our naturall disposition is as cotrary as fire to water wherfore if we will obey god we must learne to force our natures to the duties of godlines yes even sweat and take paines therein lastly here we may learne the nature of sin the spirit is not a substance but a quality and therfore the flesh which is nothing els but originall sinne and is contrary to the spirit must also be a quality for such as the nature of one contrary is such is the other there is in euery man the substance of body and soule this cannot be sin for then the spirit also should be the substance of man there is also in the substance the faculties of body amp soule amp they can not be sinne for then euery man should haue lost the faculties of his soule by adams fall lastly in the faculties there is a contagion or corruption which carieth them against the law and that is properly sinne and the flesh which is contrary to the spirit the fourth point is touching the persons in whom this combat is paul shewes who they are whe he saith so that ye can not ampc where it appeares that such as haue this cobat in them must be as the galatians man iustified amp sanctified and yet not all such but only they that be of yeres for the infants of the faithfull how soeuer we must repute them to belong to the kingdom of heauen amp therfore to be iustified amp sanctified yet because they do not commit actuall sin they want this cobat of the flesh and spirit which stads in actio as for those which be unregenerate they neuer felt this fight if any say that the worst man in the world when he is about to comit any sinne hath a strife amp fight in him it is true indeed but that is another kind of cobat which is between the conscienceand the heart the coscience on the one part terrifying the man fro sinne the will and the affections haling amp pulling him therunto the will amp the affections wishing amp desiring that sin were no sin amp god commandement abolished wheras contrariwise the conscience with a shril voice proclaimes sin to be sin this fight was in pilat who by the force of his conscience feared to condemne christ amp yet was willing and yeelded to condemne him that he might please the people furthermore this cobat is in the regenerate but during the time of this life for they which are perfitly sanctified feele no strifte if any shal say that this cobat was in christ whe he said father if it be thy will let this cup passe from me yet not my will but thine be done indeed here is a cobat but of another sort namely the fight of two diverse desires the one was a desire to do his fathers will in suffering the death of the crosse the other a natural desire which was no sinne but a meere infirmity of humane nature whereby he in his manhood desires as the maner of nature is to seek the preseruation of it selfe to haue the cursed death of the crosse remooued from him the fift point is the effect of this combat which is to make the man regenerate that he can not doe the things which he would and this must be understood in things both good amp ill and first he can not do the evill which he would for two causes first because he cannot commit sin at what time soeuer he would s john saith he that is borne of god sinneth not neither can he sin because he is borne of god that is he can not sin at his pleasure or when he will ioseph when he was assaulted by putiphars wife to adultery because the grace of god abounded in him wherby he answered her saying shall i doe this amp sin against god he could not then sin lot because his righteous heart was grieved in seeing and hearing the abominations of sodom could not then sin as they of sodom did hence it appeares that such persons as liue in the daily practise of sin against their own consciences though they be professours of the true religion of christ haue no soundnes of grace in them secondly the man regenerate can not sin in what manner he would and there be two reasons therof first he can not sinne with full consent of will or with all his heart because the will so far forth as it is regenerate resisteth and draweth back yes even then when a man is caried headlong by the passions of the flesh he feeles some contrary motions of a regenerate coscience it is a true rule that sin doth not reigne in the regenerate for so much grace as is wrought in the mind will affectios so much is abated proportionally of the strength of the flesh wherfore whe he comits any sin he doth it partly willingly amp partly against his wil as the mariners in the tepest cast ionas into the sea willingly for otherwise they had not done it amp yet against their willes too which appeares because they prayed and cast their goods out of the ship amp laboured in rowing against the tempest amp that very long before they cast him out and herein lies the difference betweene tvvo man comitting one amp the same sinne the one of them being regenerate the other unregenerate for the latter sins with all his heart amp with full consent amp so doth not the first secodly though he fall into any sin yet he doth not lie log in it but speedily recouers himself by reason of grace in his hart hence it is manifest that sinnes of infirmitie are comitted only of such as are regenerate as for the man unregenerate he cannot sin of infirmity whatsoeuer some falsly think for he is not weak but stark dead in sinne and sinnes of infirmity are such only as rise of constraint feare hastines amp such like sudden passions in the regenerate aed though they sin of weaknes often by reason of this spirituall combat yet they do not alwaies for they may sinne against knowledge amp coscience of presumptio to come to the secod point the regenerate ma cannot do the good which he would because he cannot do it perfitly amp soundly according to god will as he would paul saith to will is present with me but i find no means perfitly to do that which i would in this point the godly man is like a prisoner that is gotten forth of the gayle amp that he might escape the hand of the keeper desires amp striues with all his heart to run an miles in a day but because he hath strait and weighty boults on his legs cannot for his life creep past a mile or twain amp that with chafing his flesh amp tormenting himselfe so the servant of god do hartily desire amp indeavour to obey god in all his commadements as it is said of king iosias that he turned to god with all his heart with all his soule with all his might according to all the lawes of moses ampc yet because they are clogged with the boltes of the flesh they perfourme obedience both slowly and weakely with diverse slips amp falles thus much of the combat now let vs see what use may be made of it first of all by it we learn what is the estate of a christian man in this life a christia is not one that is free fro al evil cogitations fro rebellious inclinations amp motios of will amp affections fro all maner of slips in his life amp coversation for such an one is a mere deuise of mans brain amp not to be found upo earth but indeed he is the sound christia that feeling himselfe laden with the corruptions of his vile amp rebellious nature bewailes them fro his hart amp with might and main fights against them by the grace of god spirit againe here is ouerthrown the popish opinion of merit amp iustificatio by workes of grace on this manner such as the cause of works is such are works theselves the cause of works in man is the mind will amp affectios sanctified in which the flesh amp the spirit are mixt togither as hath bin shewed before therfore works of grace euen the best of them are mixt works partly holy amp partly sinfull wherby it is euidet to a man that hath but comon sense that they are not answerable to the righteousnes of the law amp that therfore they can neither merit life or any way iustify a ma before god if any reply that good works are the works of god spirit amp for that cause perfitly righteous i answer it is true indeed they come fro the holy ghost that can not sin but not only or immediatly for they come also from the corrupt mind and will of man and in that respect become sinfull as sweete water issuing out of a pure fountaine is by a filthy channell made corrupt thirdly we do hece learn that concupiscece or originall sin is properly amp indeed sin after baptism though it please the councel of trent to decree otherwise for after baptism it is flat cotrary to the spirit amp rebels against it papists obiect that it is take away by baptism ans original sin or the flesh is take away in the regenerate thus in it there be things the guilt the punishment the corruptio the first are quite abolished by the merit of christs death in baptisme the third that is the corruptio remaines still but mark in what manner it remains weakened it remaines not imputed to the person of the beleeuer lastly hereby we are taught to be watchfull in prayer watch amp pray saith christ ampc for the spirit is ready but the flesh is weak rebecca when twins stroue in her wombe was troubled amp said why am i so wherefore she wet to ask the lord namely by some prophet so when we feele this inward fight the best thing is to haue recourse to god by prayer and to his word that the spirit may be strengthened against the flesh as the children of israel by compassing the city of ierico daies and by sounding rammes hornes overturned the walles thereof so by serious invocation of god name the spirite is confirmed and the turrets and towres of the rebellious flesh battered

manie among vs denie the god head amp many the manhood of christ that which was from the beginning and therefore true god which wee haue hearde namelie speaking which wee haue seen with these our eies which we haue looked vpon and these hands of ours haue handled of that word not the sounding but the essentiall word of the father of life liuing of himselfe and giuing life to all other before you goe any further this word of life is inuisible how then could it be seene yes for that life was made manifest to wit in the flesh and we i with many others haue seen it and beare witnesse and publish vnto you that eternall life which was with the father eternallie before this manifestation and was made manifest vnto vs menander ebion and cerinthus hauing bin teachers among vs confidently denie these thinges which you say and they beare vs in hand that they seek our good that which i wil repeat again for more certainties sake which wee haue seen and heard declare we vnto you that ye may haue fellowship with vs and that our fellowship also may be with the father and with his son iesus christ and these things write we vnto you that your ioy might be ful vz might haue sound consolation in your consciences wel then lay vs down som groud wherby we may come to be assured that we haue fellowship one with an other and with christ this then is the message which we haue heard of him and declare vnto you that god is light vz purenes it selfe and blessednesse whereas man and angels are neither but by participation and in him is no darknes som that make profession among vs continue stil in their olde course and conuersation and yet they say they haue fellowship with god if we say that we haue fellowship with him and walk lead the course of our liues in darknes vz ignorance error impietie wee lie dissemble and do not trulie deal not sincerely what then is the true marke of one which hath fellowship with god if we walk in the light lead the cours of our liues in sinceritie of life amp doctrin wee haue fellowship one with another we are so defiled with sinne that we often doubt least wee haue no fellowship with god the bloud of iesus christ his son cleanseth vs from all sinne some among vs are come to that passe that they say they haue no sinne amp that this estate is a signe of fellowshippe with god if vve say that vve haue no sinne vve deceiue our selues imagining that to bee true which is otherwise amp truth is not in vs how then may we know that our sinnes are washed away by christ if vve confesse our sinnes namely with an humbled heart desiring pardon he is faithfull amp iust in keping his promise to forgiue vs our sinnes and to clense vs from al vnrighteousnes if vve say as they before named do vve haue not sinned vve mak him a liar whose word speaks the contrarie and his vvorde is not in vs his doctrine hath noe place in our heartes if this be true which hath bin saide that the bloud of christ doth clese from all sinne and that if we do confesse them they shal be pardoned our corruption tels vs that we may sinne freely my litle children these thinges i write vnto you that yee sinne not alas we fall oft by infirmitie what shall we then do if any man sinne vve haue an aduocate who in his own name and by his own merites pleades our cause to the father iesus christ the iust and therefore fit to make intercession but howe may euery one of vs in particular knowe that christ is his aduocate he is the propitiation vz a couering of sinne or reconciliation as the propitiatorie of the arke couered the lawe and not for our sinnes onely but also for the sins of the vvhole vvorld not onely iewes but also gentiles of all sortes be it that i knowe him to be my aduocate may i not be deceaued howe may i knowe that this my knowledge is effectuall to saluation hereby are vve sure that vve know him here that knowledg is ment whereby a man applies christ and all his benefites to his own soule if vve keepe to keep is not to fulfill but to haue a care and desire to do it for god of his mercie in his servant accepts the will for the deede his commandements many among vs professe that they know christ but their liues be not according he that saith i know him amp keeps not his commandements is a lyer and the trueth is not in him how may it be prooued that the endeuour to keep god commandements is a mark of faith amp felloship with christ he in whome the loue of god is perfecte may hereby know that hee is in christ but he that keepeth his vvord in him is the loue of god vz not that loue wherewith god loueth him but that whereby he loueth god is perfect indeede vz sincere and sounde perfection being opposed not to imperfection but to hypocrisie hereby therefore we know that we are in him he that saith he remaineth in him ought to walke euen so as hee hath walked and therefore he must needes endeuour himselfe in the commandementes declare vnto vs some of the principall of these commandements brother i vvrite no nevv commandement vnto you but an olde commaundement vvhich yee haue heard from the beginning this old commandement is the vvord vvhich ye haue heard from the beginning againe a nevve commandement i vvrite vnto you that vvhich is true to wit that the commandement is new which he wil now write in him who reneweth the comandement of old giuen to moses amp also in you for the darknes is past vz the hardening of the minds of man vnder the olde testament whereby they did but in a small measure vnderstand the word and that true light a greater mesure of illuminatio as also the writing of god lawes not in tables of stone but in the fleshie hearts so as they be transformed into the obedience thereof now shineth well set downe this commandement which is so ancient and is nowe renewed he that saith as many among you do that he is in the light that is that hee is both plentifully inlightened and borne anew and hates his brother is in darknes vnder the estate of damnation not yet trulie regenerate vntill this time hee that loueth his brother abideth in the light is trulie enlightened and regenerate and there is no offence vz he wil giue no occasion of euill in him but on the contrary hee that hateth his brother is in darknes and walketh in darknesse leadeth his life in ignorance and vngodlinesse and knoweth not whither he goeth because that darknesse hath blinded his eies what moueth you to deliuer vnto vs al these notes and signs of our new birth and communion with christ litle children i write vnto you because your sinnes are forgiuen you for his namesake vz by christ and his merites that yee may be certified to your comforte of this and that no kind of man among you might doubt of this i write vnto you fathers because ye delighting to tell amp hear of olde and ancient matters haue knowne him that is christ that is from the beginning i write vnto you young man because ye delighting to shewe your valour and strength haue ouercome the evil one that is sathan i write vnto you litle childre who delight alwaies to bee vnder the fathers wing because yee haue knowen the father and againe because wee are dull to marke and remember that which is good for vs i haue vvritten vnto you fathers because yee haue knowen him that is from the beginning i haue vvritten vnto you young man because yee are strong and the vvorde of god abideth in you and yee haue ouercome that wicked one if we be in the estate of grace vnder god fauour in christ howe may wee abide in it loue not this vvorld the corrupt estate of mankinde out of christ neither the thinges that are in the vvorlde for first of all to giue reasons if any man loue this worlde the loue of the father wherewith hee loued the father is not in him secondly for all that is in this vvorlde as the lust of the flesh the corruption of nature which chiefly breaketh out in evil concupiscence the lust of the eies the fruite of the former stirred vp by outward prouocations especially in the eie as it is manifest in adulterie amp couetousnes and the pride of life vz arrogancie and ambition among man in common conuersation of life is not of the father but of the vvorlde and thirdly this vvorld passeth away and the lust thereof but he that fulfilleth the wil of god abideth for euer what other thinges are we to do that we may continue little children it is the last time and as yee haue hearde that antichrist shall come a speciall antichrist the chiefe of all other who is nowe manifest to be the pope of rome euen now ar there many antichristes heretickes denying either the natures of christ or his offices or the vnion and distinction of his natures vvhereby vvee knowe that it is the last time those whome you cal antichrists were of our company and professed as we do they vvent out from vs but they vvere not of vs for if they had bene of vs they should haue continued vvith vs but this commeth to passe that it might appear that they are not al of vs how can we be assured of our continuance in grace for wee may fall as well as they do but yee haue an annointment the grace of god holy spirit resembled by the annoynting in the old testament from that holy one christ luke and knowe all thinges if wee knowe all thinges then you need not write vnto vs of these matters i haue not written vnto you because ye know not the trueth but because you know it amp that no lie is of the truth vz ye can distinguish betweene the sound doctrine of the gospel and errors what is this lie which you speak of who is a lier a deceauer a seducer but hee that denieth that iesus is christ the messias or sauiour of mankind the same is the antichrist that denieth the father and the son these whom you meane say they defend the doctrine of god as well as we and they vse to call him their father who so denieth the son hath not the father what do you inferre vpon this if it be the last time as you haue said let therfore abide in you the same doctrine concerning christ which ye haue hard from the beginning which the apostles preached and before them the prophets since the beginning of the world if that which ye haue heard from the beginning remain ye beleeuing and obeying it in you yee also shal continue in the son and in the father and this is the promise which hee hath promised vs euen life eternall wee cannot perswade our selues of perseuerance seeing man so commonly fall away from christ among vs these thinges haue i vvritten vnto you concerning them that deceaue you not meaning them of you as you seem to tak it but the annointing the spirite which yee haue receaued of christ and which hath led you into all trueth vvhich ye haue receiued of him dvvelleth in you abideth in you and will so continewe and yee neede not that any man teach you any other doctrine beside this which ye haue learned already but as the same annointing teacheth you all thinges and it is true and not lying and as it taught you ye shall abide in him and now litle children abide in him that vvhen he shall appeare vve being iustified in christ may haue boldnes and not be ashamed neither sathan nor our consciences accusing vs for sinne before him at his comming wee are still in doubt to returne back to that which you say before howe an endeuour to keepe the commaundementes should be a signe of fellowshippe with christ if ye knovv that he god is righteous knovv ye that he vvhich vvorketh righteousnes is borne of him as a child is knowen to haue such a man for his father becaus he resembleth him are we then borne of god behold vvhat loue the father hath giuen to vs that vvee should be called the sonnes of god the world doth not report vs as the sonnes and daughters of god but for the reffuse and ofscouring of the worlde for this cause the vvorld knovveth not you because it knovveth not him can god children be subiect to such infirmities and miseries as we are dearely beloued novv are vvee the sonnes of god but yet it is not made manifest vvhat vve shall be and vvee knovv that vvhen he shall be made manifest vve shall be like him hauing not equalitie but likenes of holines and glorie for vve shall see him as he is for now wee see him as it were through spectacles in the word and sacraments alas poore wretches we are not like god children for we are euen sould vnder sinne and daily carrie a masse of corruption about vs euery one that hath this hope to see him as he is purifieth vz thogh he be subiect to sinn yet he desireth and vseth the meanes to clense him selfe from sinne euen as he is pure setting before him christ as a patterne to follow howe prooue you that an endeuour to purifie our selues is a note of adoption by the contrarie whosoeuer committeth sinne practiseth sinne with full consent of wil not endeuouring himselfe in holines of life transgresseth also the lavve and for that cause being vnder the curse of the lawe cannot be god children for sinne is the transgression of the lavve vnderstand by lawe not morall lawe but any commaundement of god whether it be in the law or gospell and againe yee knovv that hee vvas made manifest took our nature on him that he might take avvay our sinnes the guilt amp punishment at once and the corruption by litle and litle and in him is no sinne thirdly whosoeuer abideth in him sinneth not he doeth not giue himself to sin so as it should raigne in him whosoeuer sinneth hath not seene him nor knovvn him to wit effectuallie so as he can apply christ and his benefites to himselfe but some teach that faith is sufficient and they emboulden vs to liue as we will litle children let no man deceiue you he that vvorketh righteousnes is righteous as he is righteous he that comitteth sin thogh he say he doeth beleeue amp therefore thinks himself justified before god is of the devil resebleth the devil as the child doth the father and is gouerned by his spirite for the devil sinneth from the beginning of the worlde which appeareth that for this purpose vvas made manifest the son of god that he might dissolue the works for the beginning and continuance of all rebellion and disobedience to god of the devil and further to displaie these seducers whosoeuer is born of god sinneth not vz doth not keepe a course in sinne howsoeuer hee fall by infirmitie for his seed vz god word cast into the hart by the operation of the spirite making a man to spring vp into a new creature remaineth in him neither can he sin because he is borne of god brieflie to come to the point how may it be known who is god childe and who is to be reputed the child of the devil in this are the children of god knowne and the children of the deuill vvhosoeuer vvorketh not righteousnes is not of god neither to giue you a plaine example hee that loueth not his brother for this is the message vvhich ye haue heard from the beginning that vve should loue one another not as cain he vvas of that euill one sathan and slew his brother and vvherefore slew he him because his owne vvorkes vvere evil and his brothers good yet if we loue those which be our brother according to the fleshe neuer so much they cease not to hate and persecute vs maruaile not my brother thogh this vvorld hate you if not to loue be a note of the childe of the deuill what is the note of god child we know that vvee are translated from death to life because vve loue the brethre vz such as be christians because they ar christians as on the contrary hee that loueth not his brother abideth in death is vnder the estate of damnation whosoeuer hateth his brother is a manslayer and yee knowe that no manslayer hath eternall life abiding in him you haue shewed vs fullie that loue is a mark of adoption nowe shew vs how we may know whether wee loue our brother or not hereby vvee haue perceiued loue that he layed downe his life for vs therefore vve ought carried with the like affection of loue to lay downe our liues for the brother manie in speech do pretend loue but we find not this willing affection and readines to shew loue whosoeuer hath this worldes good wherewith this life is sustained and seeth his brother haue neede and shutteth vp his bowels vz hath no copassion because it sheweth it selfe by the rowlling of the intrals from him how dwelleth the loue of god in him what other note is there of true loue my litle children let vs not loue in vvord nor in tongue onely but in deede and in trueth sincerely for thereby we knowe that vve are of the trueth sound professors of the gospell of christ and shall before him appease our hearts in regard of any accusation that our conscience shal lay vnto vs before god iudgment seate if our heart condemne vs an euill conscience accuse vs god is greater then our heart namely in iudging of vs amp knoweth all thinges how may we know that our consciences will not condemne vs beloued if our heart condemne vs not then haue we boldnes towards god vz to to come vnto him by prayer what other fruite is there of true loue whatsoeuer vve ask vvee receiue of him because vve keepe his commandements amp do those thinges vvhich are pleasant in his sight what are these commandements this then is his commandement that vve beleue in the name of his son iesus christ and loue one another as hee gaue commaundement haue they which keep these commaundementes their prayers graunted prooue this yes for he that keepeeh his commandements dvvelleth in him and he in him howe may wee know that god dwelleth in vs and we in him hereby vvee knowe that hee abideth in vs by that spirit of sanctification whereby wee are renewed vvhich hee hath giuen vs to return again to that which was before mentioned shall we beleeue all that say they haue the spirite dearely beloued beleeue not euery spirit vz doctrines which man bragging of the spirit do teach but try the spirits vvhether they be of god for many false prophets are gone out into the vvorld howe may we discerne of spirits hereby shall vve knowe the spirite of god euery spirit doctrin vvhich confesseth that iesus christ the messias is come in the flesh is made true man this being the substance of the gospell is of god and euery spirit that confesseth not that iesus christ is come in the flesh is not of god but this is the spirit of antichrist of vvhom ye haue hard how that he shal come amp now alredy is in the world we fear because these fals spirits ar of gret power to perswade amp seduce many little children ye are of god and haue ouercome them for greater is he that is in you god spirit then he that is in the vvorld the spirit of sathan but the doctrine of these man is of great account and hath many followers in the world ours hath but few which imbrace it they are of this vvorld therefore speak they of this vvorld and this vvorlde vz ignorant and vngodly man heareth them we are of god hee vvhich knoweth god heareth vs he vvhich is not of god heareth vs not hereby knovve vve the spirit of truth and the spirit of error namely by the liking and applause of the world howe may we preserue our selues against these seducers beloued let vs loue one another for loue commeth of god amp euery one that loueth is born of god and knoweth god by a special knowledg whereby they are assured that god the father of christ is their father christ their redemer the holy ghost their sanctifier he that loueth not knoweth not god for god is loue vz whollie bent to shew his loue and compassion to his people for a proofe of this herein was that loue of god made manifest among vs because god sent that his only begotte son into the world that we might liue through him herein is that loue not that we loued god but that he loued vs amp sent his son to be a reconciliation for our sinnes what of all this beloued if god so loued vs we ought also one to loue another how can god manifest his loue to vs he being a spirite and inuisible no man hath seene god at any time neuerthelesse if vve loue one another this is a signe that god dwelleth in vs and his loue is perfect in vs vz that loue wherewith he loueth is throughlie made manifest towards vs by our loue as the light of the moone shining on vs argueth the light of the sun shining vpo the moon of whom as fro a fountain the moone takes her light how may we know that god dwelleth in vs hereby do we know that wee dwell in him and he in vs because hee hath giuen vs of his spirite what other signe haue you of god dwelling in vs wee haue seene and do testifie that the father sent that son to be the sauiour of the vvorld whosoeuer confesseth in faith and loue that iesus is the son of god in him dwelleth god and he in god the diuell will confesse christ and wee which is more haue known amp beleued the loue which god hath in vs declare how our loue should be a signe of god his dwelling in vs god is loue amp therfore he that dwelleth in loue dwelleth in god and god in him god is loue we graunt but howe may we knowe that god is loue to vs hereby is that loue perfect vz fully made manifest in vs that vvee may haue boldnes to stand before him without fear in the day of iudgement for euen as he is so are vve in the vvorld not in equalitie but in conformitie of holines as may appeare by the contrary there is no feare in loue vz when a man is assured of god loue to him hee doeth not distrust nor seruile feare him in respect of his sinnes but perfect loue casteth out feare for feare hath painfulnesse checkings and torments of conscience and hee that feareth is not perfecte in loue what other sign is there that god is loue to vs we loue him because he loued vs first as when a man warmes him the heate of his body is because the fire is first hote if this be so then they which loue not their brethre loued of god in christ seeing al generally say they loue god if any man say i loue god and hate his brother he is a lyer for hovv can he that loueth not his brother vvhome he hath seene loue god vvhom he hath not seene and this commandement haue we of him that hee that loueth god should loue his brother also whosoeuer beleeueth that iesus is that christ true messias is born of god amp euery one that loueth him which did beget vz god the father loueth him also vvhich is begotten of him the child of god a true christian this being manifest that they ar hypocrits which say they loue god yet shew no loue to their brother teach vs howe wee may knowe that wee loue our brother in this we know that we loue the children of god when wee loue god and keepe his commandements that is indeuour to keep the beginning of the action being put for the whole for this is the loue of god the duty of loue to god that we keepe his commandements but no man can keepe the lawe his commandements are not burdenous to them that are in christ and are freed from the curse of the lawe which makes the law grieuous and are also guided by his holy spirit and this is apparant for al that is borne of god ouercommeth the vvorld sathan with all corruptions and workes of darknes by what meanes and this is the victorie vvhich hath ouercome the vvorld euen our faith which is the instrument and hand whereby we lay hold on him that he in vs and so wee by him might ouercome the world who is this that ouercommeth this vvorlde but hee vvhich beleeueth that iesus is that son of god how may we be resolued that iesus of nazaret the son of marie was the son of god and the messias hee came but basely into the world this is that iesus christ vvhich came by vvater sanctification signified by the legall washings and blood imputation of christs righteousnes or the sprinkling of his blood not by water only but by water and blood becaus christ worketh both iustification amp sanctification together amp it is that spirit a mans owne conscience inwardly purified that beareth witnes for that spirit is trueth that is that the testimonie of the spirit of adoption certifying vs that we ar the son of god is true for that i may speak it more plainly there ar three vvhich beare record in heauen the father the vvord the son and the holy ghost and these three are one namly in testimonie and there are three which beare record in earth the spirit and the vvater and blood and these three agree in one how shew you that these witnesses be autenticall and to be beleeued if vve receiue the vvitnes of man the witnes of god is greater for this is the witnes of god vz that was said to come from heuen vvhich he testified of his son again he that beleeueth in that son of god hath the vvitnes in himselfe the peace of conscience which he may feel in himself and further he that beleueth not god maketh him a lyer because he beleeued not the recorde that god vvitnessed of his son what is the effecte of that which these witnesses testifie and this is that record to wit that god hath giuen vnto vs eternall life amp this life is in his son he which hath the son hath life amp he which hath not the son of god hath not life and to conclude these things haue i written vnto you that beleeue in the name of the son of god that ye may know that yee haue life eternal amp that ye may beleeue vz increase in faith in the name of that son of god how can we haue life eternal now that are so miserable and so ful of wants and this is that assurance that wee haue in him that if we ask any thing according to his will he heareth vs how may we know that god granteth our praiers made acording to his wil if vve know that he heareth that is as it were to giue an eare to our praiers vvhatsoeuer vve ask we knowe that vvee haue the petitions vvhich vvee haue desired of him though the things that we asked be not giuen vs in that measure maner and time in which we asked them let vs heare an example of those things which god wil grant whe we pray if a man see his brother sin a sin that is not vnto death that is which may be pardoned let him ask pardon in his behalfe and he shal giue him life for them that sinne not vnto death there is a sinne vnto death after which necessarilie damnation followeth as the sinne against the holy ghost i say not that thou shouldest pray for it but is not euery sinne a sinne to death all vnrighteousnes is sinne and therefore deserueth death but there is a sinne not vnto death namely that which is pardoned in christ we feare least wee haue committed this sinne which is vnto death wee know that vvhosoeuer is borne of god sinneth not but he that is begotten of god kepeth himselfe and that vvicked one sathan toucheth him not vz doth him no violece or he cannot giue him a deadly wound we know that vve are of god and this whol vvorld lyeth in euill that is in seruitude vnder sathan and sinne how shew you that we ar of god wee know that the son of god is come and hath giuen vs a minde to knowe him that is true amp vve are in him that is true that is in his son iesus christ this same is that very god and that eternall life howe may wee keepe our selfe in god and neuer commit the sin to death litle children keepe your selues from images whether they be of false god or of the true god o iehoua vvho shal dwell as pilgrims dwel in tents in thy tabernacle the church millitant vvho shall rest in thy holy mountaine the kingdome of heauen he that walketh perfectly that is he which leadeth the course of his life vprightly who is the vpright man he that worketh righteousnes according to the commandements of the secod table and speaketh the truth in his heart as he thinketh his hart amp tongue agreeing by what notes may this vpright man be knowen and who is he i hee that slandreth not with his tongue ii nor doth hurt to his neighbour iii nor receiueth a fals report against his neighbor iv in whose eies a vile person an vngodly and vnrighteous man is contemned but hee honoureth them that feare god v he that hauing sworne to his owne hinderance changeth not vi he that giueth not his money to vsury vii neither taketh reward of the innocet are these notes vnfallible he that doth these things shal neuer be moued shall abide in god fauour for euer wee say that the elect alone may be and indeed are made sure of their election that so we may exclude the reprobat hipocrites for considering they are not elected they canne neuer be truelie perswaded that they are elected i say truely because it may come to passe that many in their own thinking shall be predestinate yet in trueth they are not perswaded so for they are deceaued wee haue an example in temporarie christians who thinke of themselues that they beleeue in christ but truelie do not beleeue for their faith is in hypocrisie and for a time onely wherefore a true amp certaine perswasion of election can neuer befall any of the reprobates because the true perswasion of heauenly matters commeth of the holy ghost which neuer perswadeth any false matter wherefore how can reprobates bee perswaded that they are elected this considered it is not amisse that wee attribute this perswasion of which wee nowe speake to the elect alone we ad further that al the elect not onely may be but are indeed made sure of their election which must be demonstratiuelie confirmed against schoole man amp other our aduersaries we say this is done in the time appointed because the elect before they be called to christ are neuer sure of their election nay they neuer think of it as appeareth in paul before hee was called and in others againe in like maner after they haue bene called yet not presently are made sure of their election but some sooner some latter lastly we ad that this is done many vvaies what they ar if not perfectly yet in parte i will afterwarde shewe nowe let vs come to the matter the school man demaunde whether a man may be made sure of his election and they determine that a man cannot except it be by diuine reuelation becaus predestination is in god and not in vs and no man knoweth the thinges of god but the spirit of god as no man knoweth the thinges of man but the spirite of man which is in him again who knoweth the minde of the lorde therefore say they some special reuelation is needeful if any desire to be certified either of his owne or of any other mans predestinatio their sayings are not simply to be disliked but in that meaning in which they vnderstad them they are no way to be approoued for they take a speciall reuelation to be this if god shall signifie and say expresly to any either by some angell outwardly or by his spirite inwardly that he is predestinate to life after which sorte they hold that paul and a fewe other saintes had their predestination reuealed to the so they conclude that because euery man hath not his election reuealed to him after this maner that all man cannot be assured of their election but they are deceued for god not onely by this one maner which they spake off doth reueale his will amp his counsels but by many for god reuealeth thinges either by the inwarde inspiration of his spirit or outwardly by his word or both inwardly and outwardly by inward and outward effectes by his spirite hee did inspire his prophetes and open many thinges to come and christ said to his apostles as concerning the holy ghost he shall lead you into all trueth by his word he spake vnto the prophets and in like maner by his word hee teacheth vs his wil also by diverse effectes hee declareth either his mercie or his iustice as it is known the same must be thought of the reuealing of his electio to wit that god reuealeth the same to the elect by the holy ghost by the worde and by the most certaine effectes of predestination the first testimonie by which god assureth vs of our election is the inward testimonie of the spirite of which the apostle saith the spirit of god testifieth vnto our spirits that vve are the children of god nowe what is it to be the son of god but first of al to be predestinated to be the childe of god by adoption amp then to be made actuallie the son of god by faith and lastly by the same spirit also to be regenerate as god children are and to put on the nature of the son of god or rather the son of god himselfe as the apostle speaketh therefore the holy ghost whilest he inwardly beareth recorde vnto our spirits that is to our minds being enlightened by his light that we are the sonnes of god most plainly reuealeth that wee were predestinate from all aeternitie to adoption for man are not made the sonnes of god by faith nor regenerate to be the sonnes of god nor put on christ except they be first of all predestinated to adoption and there can be nothing more certain then this testimonie for who better knoweth the things of god his counsels and decrees then the spirit of god which searcheth all thinges yes the deep things of god therefore hee can most truly reueale vnto euery one of vs the certaintie of our election and he cannot deceiue vs in reueiling it for he is the spirit of truth which can neither deceiue nor be deceaued if an angel from heauen shoulde be sent to thee as he was sent to marie and as hee spake vnto the fathers and should tell thee in the name of god that thou wert elected to life euerlasting wouldest not thou say that thou couldest not then doubt any longer of thy election but so much the more certaine is the testimonie of the spirite which beareth record vnto our spirit that we are the sonnes of god by how much the holy ghost doth more knowe the thinges of god then any angell and can lesse deceiue then an angel and so much the more sure is this testimonie considering it is not keept in the bodily eares where it might soone vanish away but in our minde and spirit becaus the spirit beareth record to our spirit ad further that the holy ghost neuer departeth from our spirit but dwelleth in vs abideth in vs speaketh in vs sheweth forth his power in vs praieth in vs therefore the apostle saith that wee haue receiued the spirite of adoption by which we crie abba father as thogh he should say this testimonie of the spirite is altogether so sure by which he beareth vs record that we are the sonnes ef god that presently without doubting we can call vpon god and cry abba father and all the electe haue this testimonie being made the son of god by faith and being renewed by the holy ghost and ingrafted into christ for so the apostle speaketh if any man haue not the spirit of christ he is not his therefore whosoeuer is christs and is ingrafted into christ it is necessarie hee should haue the spirit of god and whosoeuer haue receiued and doe enioy the spirite of christe to their mindes the same spirit beareth record that they are the sonnes of god and maketh them to cry abba father and it is certaine that noe man is renewed by the holy ghost which is not perswaded that god is his most mercifull and most louing father amp therefore can call vpon him as a father therefore although al man in that they are assured by the certaintie of faith that god is their father and they are his son do not thereby argue and conclude that they are elected to eternal life yet al man indeed haue thereby a sure testimonie of their election to glorie because if they be the sonnes of god they are also heires of eternall life this testimonie i will briefly comprise within this demonstration whosoeuer call vpon god and in their hearts cry abba father they are the sonnes of god and it is certain that they thus crye by the spirit of god and they which are the sonnes of god are also heires of eternall life and they haue bene predestinate to adoption therefore it must needes be that all they which are perswaded that they ar the son of god by the holy ghost are predestinate to eternall life and must be perswaded of it this is the first testimonie and the first way by which god reuealeth to euery elect man his predestination namely by the holy ghost within our heartes bearing record vnto vs that we are the sonnes of god in christ and by christ and let this be the first argument also seruing to confirme our assertion the second way by which god reuealeth to euery man his predestination is by his word i mean not any particular word by which hee doeth declare to any outwardlie in priuate and speciall maner and that in expresse wordes his election but the general word of the gospel by which christ calleth all them which beleeue in him elect both by himselfe and by his apostles as in the new testament euerie where is most manifest for although in particular propositions he say not to thee or to him particularlie thou article elect to eternall life yet by means of generall propositions he doeth aswell conclude in the heart of euerie one that beleeueth that he is elected as any man shall be able to conclude vnto particular man that euery one of them is a liuing creature indewed with reason by this general proposition euerie man is a reasonable creature indued vvith reason the assumption beeing suppressed therefore after this maner dealeth god he hath chosen all and euerie seuerall man whom he was to indew with faith to haue the euerlasting inheritance furthermore he publisheth it to al the elect by the apostles in this general proposition that all the faithful are elect to eternall life the assumption is concealed in the word of god but when he giueth vs faith he maketh euerie one of vs to make an assumption by himselfe in his minde but i am of the faithfull for i finde in my selfe that i trulie beleeue in christ therefore who is it that maketh this conclusion for thee that thou article predestinat to euerlasting life euen god himselfe the proposition being taken forth of the gospell amp the assumption proceedeth of the gift of faith but that indeed by which we properlie attaine to the knowledge of the matter conteined in the conclusion is the midle tearme as they call it wherefore it is manifest that god by the worde of his gospel wher he saith that al the faithfull ar elect doth reueale to euerie faithfull man his owne predestination onelie this one thing is to be required that the faithfull man hearing the vniuersall propositions in his mind should make an assumption but i am faithfull by the gifte and grace of god and is not god said to haue reuealed to euery man his speciall malediction in this generall proposition cursed is euerie one that doth not continue in al things that are vvritten in this book althogh he say to no man specially thou article accursed for euery one doth mak this assuptio that he is accursed because he knoweth most certely that he doth not cotinue in al things that are written in the book of the lawe therfore the schoolmen ar deceiued whe they say it maybe that euery man may be sure of his election namelie if god which is able will reueale it to him yet that hee doth onlie reueale it to a very few as the apostles for god as hath bene proued amp declared euen by his worde in generall propositions doth reueale to euerie man his predestination for what can be more certaine than this demonstration whosoeuer doe truelie beleeue in christ they are elect to eternall life in christ but i truelie beleeue in christ therefore i am elected but some make an exception and say that this were a demonstration and that most certaine and euident if a man might be able to knowe that he were indewed with true faith in christ but here lieth all the difficultie for many thinke that they trulie beleeue in christ whereas neuertheles their faith is hypocritall and teporary as appeareth by the euangelists ansvver we graunt that they which beleeue by such a faith which is in hypocrisie and only lasteth for a time that they are deceiued whilst they thinke that they doe trulie beleeue and yet do not indeed for they are like them which dream that they are kings when as they are very beggers but we say that they which beleeue by a true faith doe knowe whether they trulie beleeue or no and they are not deceiued when they say and think that they trulie beleeue for they are like vnto the which handeling a pretious stone by reason that they are indued with sense know and say that they handle it and if no man might certainly know whether he beleeued truly or not why doeth the apostle say trie your selues vvhether you bee in the faith and if it be so no man can euer certainlie know whether he be justified considering that they onlie which trulie beleeue can be justified and if a man giuing credit to another mans words doth certainly knowe that he beleeueth him how much more doeth he know it which being indued with true faith by the holy ghost beleeueth the gospell in a word godlie writers haue prooued against school man that they which are indued with true faith in christ cannot bee ignorant of it but say they no man is certaine of his perseuerance in faith and therefore out of this vniuersall proposition he vvhich beleeueth namelie vvith a true and constant faith is elected to life no man can conclude that he is elected by reason that albeit hee may knowe that hee is indued with true faith yet he cannot tel whether it shal be perpetuall this collection is absurde amp the learned haue fully prooued that true faith is perpetual and therfore they which certainly know that they beleeue in a true faith are also certaine that the same their true faith shall neuer perish in this world partlie for the promise of god i vvill put my feare into their hearts that they may neuer depart from me and partlie for the prayer of christ i haue praied for thee peter that thy faith doe not faile seeing it is so it is very certain that god by his word in which generallie he saith that all the faithfull are elect doeth reueale to euerie man his election cosidering that the proposition taken out of the gospell is most certaine and euerie faithfull man may assume to himselfe that he is indewed with true faith in christ the third way by which god reueleth to euery one of vs his predestination is by the effects of predestination as wel inward in vs as outward by which as by certaine markes imprinted in vs he doeth seale vs to himselfe in christ and doth so seale vs that if we shall giue diligent heed we may thereby euidently perceaue that we are set apart from the common sort of man which is often called by the name of the world that we are foreknowen for his sonnes and loued in christ and predestinated to eternall life yes and that we appertaine no longer to the world but to that citie which is aboue that hath his foundation as the apostle saith and wee haue a two fold reason of this argument one because these effectes of which wee speake and which we will afterward handle god worketh not in any but his elect as also afterward wee will shewe therefore by right a man may by a true feeling and experience of these effects in himself be assured of his particular election and predestination to haue fellowshippe with christ in all his graces for predestination as augustine witnesseth is a preparation to the blessings of god by which most certainly they are made free whosoeuer are made free therefore whosoeuer feeleth himselfe freed through these graces of god may be assured and certified of his predestination the other reason is that these effects are not onely the effects simplie of predestination but also such effectes they are that they may also may be seals of it namlie in printing in vs a liuely form and image of god foreknowing vs louing vs electing vs and therefore albeit wee cannot see the purpose the foreknowledg the election and predestination of god as concerning our selues in god himselfe foreknowing willing and electing vs yet wee may beholde in our selues som sure representations of al these imprinted and euen stamped in vs by the word and so by the beholding of these formes and impressions in our selues wee shall easily be brought to the knowledge of those patterns as it were which are in the lord himselfe the matter by reason it is very good and comfortable may be declared by a similitude god is like vnto the sun in regard of vs the sun when it shineth vpon vs and after a sort looketh vs in the face it doth after such a sort imprinte an image of his light in our eies that wee also in like manner beeing made partakers of his light may looke againe vpon the sun it selfe and vpon his light for the light of the sun and his beams being sent down vpon vs are beaten back and reflected againe towardes the sun so in like maner the forknowledg of god by which he hath and would acknowledg vs for his from all eternitie it alwaies resteth in god and cannot of it selfe bee perceaued of vs but yet whilst god doth acknowledg vs for his hee doth portrait in vs his elect a certaine forme and image of his foreknowledge by which hee maketh vs renouncing all other god to acknowledge him for our onely true god thus it commeth to passe that through this true knowledge of god which hee vouchsafeth vs and by which wee doe acknowledg god for our god and father we may after a sort beholde in god himselfe his foreknowledg by which he hath foreknowen vs for his sonnes for first of all god doth acknowledg vs for his and then the electe being made partakers of this his light and knowledg hee causeth vs in like maner to acknowledg him to this purpose serueth that which our sauiour christ saith first saith he i knowe my sheep after he addeth and again i am knowen of mine as though he should say whiles i acknowledg them for my sheep i make them by meanes of this my light amp knowledg that they also can acknowledg me for their pastor so the apostle saith to the galathians when yee shall knowe god or rather are known of him he teacheth therefore that god knewe the galathians because he had first acknowledged them for his in his eternall predestination and by giuing vnto them this his wisdome he made them acknowledge the true god for their god the same may be said of the loue of god by which hee loued vs in christ to euerlasting life before the foundation of the world god by louing vs doth print in our heartes the image of his loue by which wee may loue him again from our hearts and as it wer by the reflection of the sun beames sent downe into our heartes wee may be prouoked to loue againe for the loue of god to vs being eternall and causing eternall life begetteth in the time appointed a certaine loue in vs seruing for his eternal glory and to this purpose is that of saint john not that vvee first loued god but becaus he first loued vs as though hee had saide therefore wee loue god because hee first that is before the foundatio of the world louing vs in christ by the ingrauing of his loue in our hearts causeth vs to loue him againe as a father so loue is saide to wit that loue by which we loue god to be of god that is to proceede of the loue of god towardes vs and paul writeth that the loue of god namely that loue by which hee loued vs to be shed in our heartes by the holy ghost which is giue vs and by this shedding of the loue of god in our harts it commeth to passe that loue is also wrought in our heartes towardes god and therefore by that sound loue by which wee feele our selues to loue god we are made to knowe how great that loue of god is by which he loued vs from all aeternitie in christ and what is that loue els but predestination in like manner election by which hee singled vs from the rest of the worlde in christ that we might be holy before him begets in vs a certain image euen of god himself that is another electio by which wee renouncing all other god which are worshipped in the world make our choise of this our true god iehouah to bee our god that hee may be alwaies before our eies hee which sanctifieth vs and the authour of our whole saluation wherfore through this costant election which is in vs we perceiue that that election which is in god as concerning vs is firm and sure not onely as wee gather the cause by the effect but also as wee gather the pattern by the picture like as by the similitude of the forme of a seale fashioned in wax we doe easilie vnderstande what is the very forme and fashion of the seale therefore it is manifest that it is the maner of god by the effectes of his election and predestination imprinted in vs to reueale to euerie one of vs his own election and predestination and that two waies both because there are certaine effectes of predestination and by the effects the causes are knowen and also because there are certaine liuely types of god fore knowledg and election by which we are sealed vppe vnto god now by the imprinting of these forms and types in vs as the seale is in wax the verie first patterns themselues are known what they are furthermore that there is no man elected to eternal life which shall not be sealed vp in the time appointed with these marks of god election it is manifest out of these places of scripture which treat of election and predestination the apostle teacheth that vvee vvere elected that vvee might be holie and vvithout blame also hee teacheth that all they whome god hath predestinated are likewise called and justified and by consequent indued with faith and knowledge of god by which they take him for their father with loue also wherewith they loue him as a father also with a good will amp constant purpose by which they desire constantlie his glorie againe he saith in another place the foundation standeth sure hauing this seale in respect of god the lord knovveth vvho are his now in respect of vs he putteth down another seale saying let him depart from iniquitie vvhich calleth vpon the name of the lord for with this marke all the elect are branded they call vpon the name of the lord and depart from iniquitie seeking after holinesse amp a good conscience and this is that sealing which is so often mentioned in the scriptures as when in the apocalypse it is said that an innumerable multitude was sealed to the lord for like as the father sealed iesus christ as he was man and mediatour so also the rest of his children he hath sealed and doth daylie seale with sure notes and seales to distinguish them from other man and the children of this age for god is said to haue annointed vs and sealed vs and giuen vs the earnest of his spirit in our hearts and againe to haue sealed vs with the holie spirit of promise and that to the day of redeption as it is easie to discerne a right seale from a counterfeit so the true soules of god by the sealing of the spirit are distinguished from hypocrits and lawful children from bastards it remaineth that wee shoulde declare some effects of predestination by which as by marks and seales the elect may bee discerned from reprobats the first effect of predestination is christ himselfe as he is a mediatour and a sauiour dwelling in our hearts by his holie spirite for as we are elected in him and by him redeemed so by the sprinkling of his blood wee are cleansed and sealed and by his dwelling in vs quickned for he is our life and that eternall and therfore we are seuered fro reprobates which alwaies remaine in death as in the holie scriptures we are taught we say that this is the first effect of predestination because we can enjoy none of the gifts of god either of election vocation or justification except in christ and by christ for he hath powred out all the effectes of predestination into vs in that therefore euery elect faithfull man feeleth christ to dwell in him and to quicken him he hath a seale in himselfe by which he may knowe that he was elected to euerlasting life in the same christ a part and beginning of which life is this spirituall life by which wee now liue to god and as euerie man knoweth himself to be the son of god in christ because he calleth vpon god from his heart as a father so he may conclude that he is predestinated to be the son of god for christs cause and that by this first note the faithfull may know that they are elect to eternall life the apostle sheweth knovv ye not saith he your selues that iesus christ is in you except ye be reprobates and no doubt a type of this kinde of sealing was that sealng whiche was done in egypt by the blood of the lambe namely when the houses of the israelites were sprinkled with this blood that they might be discerned from the houses of the aegyptians and so bee passed ouer vntouched of the angell and by christe as by the chiefe effect yes and the cause to of all the effectes which followe all other effects of predestination are put into vs and we are sealed with them the apostle nameth three principals our calling to wit effectuall our justification and glorification this third effect we shall obtaine in the life to come the two first in this life and to these two may very well be referred all other which we receiue in this life by christ with the effectuall calling wee joyn a sound hearing of the word of god and the vnderstanding of it accompanied with great and constant delight and joy faith also and a true knowledge of the deitie humanitie and office of christ vnto iustification wee refer a perswasion of the remission of our sins by christ for by this we are iustified and regeneration too or sanctification and renouation of life a good conscience loue not faigned a pure hart and cleane patience in aduersitie and boasting in tribulation all good workes and fruits of the spirit ad hereunto the crosse it selfe which wee beare for the trueth of the gospel wherefore whosoeuer feeleth that he is effectually called that hee doth willingly heare the worde that he doth beleeue the gospell that he is sure of the remission of his sinnes that hee burneth with true loue to his neighbour that he is bent to euerie good work he cannot but must needes be perswaded of his election for god onely doth communicate these vnto the elect therefore it is plaine that the elect are confirmed in the assurance of their election by the effectes of predestination and that there is a threefold way by which god reuealeth to euery man his predestination but if any shal take an occasion the rather of doubting of his election then of confirming himselfe in it of that which hath bin spoken as concerning the fruits of the spirit and the effects of predestination and that peraduenture because hee can feele in himselfe few and verie weake fruites of regeneration and election yet let him not bee discouraged neither let him doubt of his election but let him vnderset himselfe with these props first of all if euer he truelie felt in himselfe that testimonie of the spirite which before i mentioned namelie that he is the sonn of god let him know vndoubtedlie that he is such a one and therfore elected to eternall life for the holie ghost neuer beareth record or perswadeth a man of that which is false for he is the spirite of truth and they are not the sonnes of god except they haue bene predestinate as the apostle saith to adoption by christ and none that is the son of god and a man elected can be made a reprobate and the childe of the deuill therefore albeit he feele in himselfe both fewe and feeble effects of regeneratio yet let him not doubt of his election otherwise he shall disgrace the testimonie which he hath receiued of the holie ghost yes and that to which as yet he enjoyeth although peraduenture by reason that his mind is troubled by euill affections that testimonie of the holie spirite can scarse be heard in him for the true testimonie of our adoption by the holy ghost being once giuen vnto our spirit lasteth for euer although it is other whiles heard more plainlie and at other times is more slenderly and scarce perceiued but how say you may i know whether that testimonie doth proceed fro the holie ghost and therfore whether it be a true and certain testimonie i answer first by the perswasion secondly by the maner of the perswasion lastlie by the effects of this testimonie and perswasion for the first the holy ghost doeth not simplie say it but doth perswade with vs that we are the sonnes of god and no flesh can doe this againe he perswades vs by reasons drawne not from our works or from anie worthines in vs but from the alone goodnes of god the father and grace of christ in this manner the deuill will neuer perswade any lastlie the perswasion of the holy ghost is ful of power for they which are perswaded that they are the sonnes of god cannot but needs must call him abba father and in regarde of loue to him doe hate sin and whatsoeuer is disagreeing to his will and on the contrarie they haue a sound and a hartie desire to do his will if at anie time thou hast felt in thy selfe any such testimonie perswade thy selfe it was the testimonie of the holie ghost and that very true amp certain to amp therfore that thou article the child of god amp predestinate to eternal life this is the first proppe by which wee must vnderset that weake beleefe we haue of our certain election to eternal life again hold this without wauering whosoeuer thou article that article tempted to doubt of thy election euen as nothing is required at our handes to worke our election for god chose vs of his onlie meer goodnes so that we may trulie know whether we bee elect or not this one thing shall be sufficient namelie if we shal attain to the certain knowledge of this that we are in christ and partakers of him for he that is nowe ingrafted into christ amp is justified it cannot be but that he was elected in christ before the foundation of the worlde and that wee may be in christ faith is both required and is sufficient not perfect faith but true faith though it be so litle that it be like a graine of mustarde seed and feeble like a young borne babe and that sore diseased to now that faith which is a liuelie and a true faith lasteth alwaies as hath bene before declared neither can it at any time altogether faile and so it commeth to passe that they which once haue ben truly ingrafted into christ remaine alwaies amp continue in him according to that saying all that my father giueth me shall come to me amp he which commeth vnto me i wil not cast forth this is true no doubt that look how much the faith is more perfect so much the greater power it hath to knit vs more to christ and therefore we must alwayes endeuour to increase in faith yet for all that this is most certaine one litle sparke of true faith is sufficient to engraft vs into christ and for that cause we must in no wise doubt of our ingrafting into christ and of our election to by reason of the weaknesse of faith and of the small and slender fruits it bringeth out but how shal i certainly know say you whether my faith be a true amp liuely faith or not out of the same groundes from whence the testimonie of our adoption is perceiued first of all if you shall trulie feele that you are perswaded of the truth of the gospell yes and that all your sins are pardoned you for christ and you receiued to fauour againe if you see that this perswasion is grounded not vpon any merits of yours but on the sole goodnesse of god and grace of christ lastly if you feele such a confidence to approch vnto and call vpon the father amp such a loue towards him and his son iesus christ that ye do hate and detest whatsoeuer is against his glorie as all sinne and on the contrarie bee caried away with a desire to doe those things which serue for the aduancing of his glorie and therfore that you loue all those which desire and seeke the same as the brother amp friendes of christ for these be the effectes which can neuer be seuered from true faith and this is the disposition of true faith therefore as long as thou feelest these effects in thy selfe albeit verie slender and greatlie languishing yet assure thy selfe thou article indewed with true faith although it bee weake and therefore thou article in christ yes and in christ elected to wherefore thou must not doubt of thy saluation and election by reason of thy daylie slips proceeding from thy weaknesse of faith no not for haynous crimes like as neither dauid for his adulterie and murther nor peter for his threefold deniall did dispair of their election which appeareth in that being plunged in the verie gulfes of their temptations they held fast their faith as an anchor and called vppon god this is the second propp lastlie in no wise wee must forget namelie that our election is certaine and immutable and therefore as it is done without respect of any works of ours so in like sort it can neuer be chaged by any of our euill deserts for as it is first proceded from the only free purpose of god so it is grounded thereon true it is we prouoke god wrath against vs by our sins and neither wil god let them escape vnpunished but hee chastiseth vs by diverse both inward amp outward scourges as may appeare in dauid aboue all other yet for al that it is his good pleasure that for his goodnes sake and trueth for the obediece of christ that his purpose shuld remaine sure and our election so it commeth to passe that he giueth vs repentace anew to raise vs vp amp to receiue vs to fauour therfore although for the present thou feelest thy selfe to be of weake faith and to haue fallen to diverse sinnes yet whereas heretofore thou hast had many and euident testimonies of thy election as the testimony of the holie ghost and the testimonie taken from faith amp the effects of faith at this present assuredlie thou canst not doubt of thy electio for thy sins committed but thou shalt much derogate from this free election and also from the testimonies of thy election heretofore injoyed yes amp those which yet thou enjoyest for if thy sinnes displease thee amp thou desirest to liue without blame onely for that thy sins displease thee why now thou hast a new testimonie of thy election for such repentance as this is is onely proper vnto the elect therefore by these three proppes we must vphold our faith as touching euerie ones particular election and thus much as concerning the certaintie with the which euerie man must bee perswaded that he is elected in christ to eternal life before the foudation of the world wee must mark the end to which we are predestinate amp to which we say that one day wee shal be brought for there is a double end of our election the one concerneth the elect themselues namely their glorification or their eternall life and glorie in heauen of which is spoken rom the other concerneth god himselfe which chuseth namly the glory of god that is that the glory of his grace may be known and eternally made manifest of which is mention made ephesian both of them are so coupled together that whosoeuer are praeelected to the first are also predestinat to the latter and the latter followeth of the former for the more wee shall be made partakers of the grace of god amp the heauenly glory so much also more and more shall the glory of god be made manifest in vs but because the end which concerneth god is almost all one in the reprobatio of the wicked and in the predestination of the saints namely that as by the saluation of these which procedeth of his meere goodnes the glory of his grace is made manifest so also by the iust damnation of the other the glory of his diuine iustice may be made knowen to al neuerthelesse considering that the end to which the elect shall attaine is farre diverse from that for it is eternall life vnto which the reprobates are appointed for that is eternall death therefore the end of which we treate in this assertion is our eternall glorification and euerlasting life in heauen let vs nowe see in the second place what are those meanes by which the elect are brought vnto this end and therefore to which meanes we hold that al are predestinate whosoeuer are predestinate to the end and they are of two sortes some of them are soe necessarie vnto all that without them no man simplie can attaine vnto eternall life and glorie and they are christs as he is mediator and high priest and his obediece and iustice for without christ no man can be saued also our effectual calling to christ by the holy ghost and that which followeth this is our iustification yes and our regeneration to for these foure predestination vocation iustification and glorification are so linked together that it is not possible to seuer the one from the other and therfore no man can be glorified which is not iustified and no man can be iustified which is not effectually called as also no man can be effectually called which is not predestinate therfore without these not so much as children and infants can bee brought to this end of eternal glorie and therfore euen al the elect infants are inwardly in a certain peculier maner by the holy ghost called and iustified and glorified nowe there are some certaine meanes annexed vnto these albeit they haue no place in infants by reason of their age yet they belong to all other elect howsoeuer they are found in som more plenteous and liuely and in other some more sleder and weak as namely a liuely faith the hearing of the word a detestation of sinne the loue of righteousnes patience in aduersitie a care to do good workes and such like all which the apostle comprehendeth vnder the name of good workes when he saith that vve are created that is borne a new in christ vnto good vvorks vvhich god hath prepared that vve might vvalk in them that is that we might lead our liues in them and so walking at length might come to eternall life for without the we cannot come to eternall glory but by them god traileth vs thyther therefore we say that all which are elect to that end are also predestinate to the same meanes for predestination is not onely of the end but also of the means which concern the end and all as well the end as the meanes are the effectes of predestination and therefore it is very true which augustine saith predestination saith he is a preparation to the graces of god by which they indeed ar freed whosoeuer ar freed therefore the first gift of god that we may briefly consider the effectes of predestination prepared for all the elect without which they can in no wise come to the end and therefore the first effect of predestination is our lord iesus vvith his obedience merites death resurrection glorie namely in that respect he is made mediator betweene god the father and vs and the head of al the elect and therfore in as much as he is such a one he is also the cause of all other graces and benefits which come vnto vs by the free predestination of god for the effectes of predestination are so ordered among themselues that the first which go before are the causes efficient or if wee will so speake the materiall causes of the latter and those that follow therefore seeing christ is the first effect of predestination he is also the cause of all other effectes by whome wee are made partakers of them the apostle therfore doth very well to the ephesians in the first place saith he we are elected in christ namely as in the head to be his members secondly he writeth that we ar predestinat to adoption by christ namely to obtaine it for wee are adopted into the sonnes of god in christ the first begotten son of god and by making vs partakers of his sonneship we are really made the sonnes of god yes and we are also indewed with his spirit too that wee might be borne anew thirdly he saith wee are made acceptable and beloued vnto the father amp his beloued son namly christ fourrhly that wee haue our redemption in the same christ by his bloud and haue obtained remission of sinnes and all wisdome and vnderstanding fiftly that in the same christ all thinges are reconciled as wel in heauen as in earth in a worde the apostle sheweth there as also else were that whatsoeuer benefites we do or shall hereafter obtaine counting from our eternall election euen vnto our glorification all those we nowe do and shall obtaine hereafter in christ and by christ therefore whosoeuer are elected to eternall life besides this that they are elected in christ they are also predestinate to christ that is to haue fellowship with him that they may by him enioy all other benefites the second benefit of god and effect of our predestination is our effectual calling to christ and to his gospell in which the elect are onelie called because it is by the purpose and grace of god which is giuen vs in christ and an effectuall calling is knowen by the effects two of which proceede directly from it a harty kinde of hearing the word and the conceauing of it with a very greate constant and continuall delight and a true and sure beliefe of the worde of the gospell thence it is that christ saith who is of god saith he namely by election and effectuall calling heareth the word of god very willingly and from his heart and that cotinually but ye heare not because yee are not of god and this calling is wrought not onely by the preaching of the word as it is in al that be of yeeres but also and that chieflie with the inwarde inspiration of the holy ghost whiles that the father draweth them by his spirit whom he will haue to come to christ which also was said to be done in infants for this calling is the beginning of saluation euen in this life and therfore it is the apostles manner in the beginning of his epistles to make mention of this calling naming all the faithful the saintes called therfore it must needes be that all they which are elected in christ must also at length be effectually called and drawen to christ after an effectuall calling followeth faith the third effect of predestination vvhich is saide to be peculiar vnto the elect and without which as the apostle saith it is not possible to please god for by it wee are engrafted into christ and are made the members of christ amp without faith no man can be saued and that this is an effect of predestination the apostle plainly sheweth when he saith that he had obtained mercie namely in god eternal predestination that he might beleeue wherefore whosoeuer ar predestinate to obtaine eternall life in christ and by christ they are also elect to haue the very gift of faith therefore it must needes be that at length they shall beleeue in christ the fourth benefite is iustification that is a free pardonning of our sinnes and the imputation of the righteousnes of christ for it followeth faith because vvhosoeuer ar indued vvith true faith in christ are also iustified and that justification is an effect of predestination the apostle sheweth when he putteth it after calling before which he setteth predestination and when hee saith that we are elect in christ that wee might be holie amp without spot or blame in the presence of god and that this is not done while wee are in this world but by the pardoning of all our faults and by the imputation of his perfect obedience wherefore it must needs be that al the elect shal be justified and be taken for most pure amp without blame in god presence with iustification is ioyned regeneration and sanctification by the holy ghost namelie whiles vve are made new creatures by him amp the son of god to not onelie by adoption but also by regeneration for when christ justifieth vs hee doth not only forgiue vs our vnrighteousnes and impute his righteousnesse to vs but also he taketh from vs our stonie hart and giueth vs a fleshie heart of his owne and he strips vs of our olde man and puts on his newe man lastly he taketh away the corruption of our nature and makes vs partakers of his diuine nature and so indeed of the sonnes of man he makes vs the sonnes of god and his brother to therefore it is said that we are predestinated to adoption by iesus chrst and elect that we may be holie without blame and that which is borne of the spirite is called spirite therefore the elected to eternall life must needes bee begotten anew to be the sonnes of god and bee made partakers of the diuine nature and be a newe creature in christ hence issueth the sixt effect of predestination which is heedfullie to be regarded the loue of righteousnesse amp the detestation of sinne for in regeneration the affections are principallie chaged namelie the affections of the corrupt nature and flesh into the affections of the diuine nature amp spirite hence it is that the apostle saith that they which are borne anew do walke according to the spirite and not after the flesh and not to sauour the thinges of the flesh but the things of the spirite and the chiefe affections of the flesh are the loue of sinne that is the concupiscence of the flesh and contrariwise the hatred of righteousnes and the lawe of god which are not of the father but of the world therfore the chiefe affections of regeneration and the spirit are the loue of righteousnes and of the lawe of god amp the hatred of sin for that which is spoken chiefly of christ thou hast loued righteousnes and hated iniquitie is to bee vnderstood of all the members of christ endued with his spirite because it is trulie accomplished in them hence it is that dauid who in himself did represent the disposition of all the regenerate said of himselfe i haue loued thy law thy law is in the midle of my hart i haue hated all the works of iniquitie i will not sit with the wicked also paule i am delighted saith hee in the lawe of god according to the inner man that is in as much as i am borne anewe and no ma doubteth but that both these affections are the effects of predestination except he be ignorant that all these are the gifts of god which as in time he bestoweth on his so also he hath decreed to bestow them on them before the foundation of the world and from these two affections being the first fruits of regeneration ariseth a care amp endeuour to doe good vvorks that is to flie sin amp to fulfil the lawe of god vvhich is the seuenth effect of predestination for hee which hateth any thing from his heart he taketh heed of it as much as he can and he flieth from it and escheweth it and on the contrarie he which loueth any thing from his heart that also hee seeketh after and endeuoureth himselfe to the compassing of it therfore the apostle john maketh this a chiefe difference betweene the sonns of god and the children of the deuill that is between them that are borne anew and them that are not borne anew that the children of god both loue and doe righteousnesse and the children of the deuill loue sinn and doe it as also the devil sinned from the beginning amp christ came to dissolue the workes of the deuill namelie in his elect for in the reprobate he leaueth them vntouched because they are not giuen him of the father to be purged borne anew and saued therefore seeing christ was before ordayned and predestinate to the doing of all these workes and that there is no good wrought in vs which was not prouided for vs in christ from al eternitie it is a cleare case that the care also of doing good workes is an effect of predestination and the apostle plainlie teacheth it when he saith that we were created in christ to good works which god hath prepared that we might walk in them to this purpose serueth that which the apostle deliuereth of loue not vnfaigned to which he sheweth that wee were elect and of a good conscience which he makes the inseperable companion of the faith of the elect lastlie of a pure heart which he ascribeth to the elect considering the vnfaithfull haue nothing cleane in them and that their mind and conscience is defiled now that this care to doe good works is necessarie in all the elect peter sheweth it when he bids vs endeuor to make our election and calling sure by good workes as some copies haue it but to whom shall we make it sure not vnto god for it was sure vnto him before the foundation of the worlde but vnto our selues and to our neighbours and this is one of the chiefest vses of good woorkes that by them not as by causes but as by effects of predestination and faith both we and also our neighbours are certified of our election and of our saluation to furthermore considering whiles we haue a care to glorifie god to do good works and wee will not bee conformable to the world in the wickednes of it neither submit our selues to our flesh amp sathan the flesh the world and sathan do perpetuallie war against vs amp therwithal it cometh to passe they being most valiant enemy that eyther we are ouercome or at the least in fighting are foyled and therfore we are constrained to flie vnto the lord and to craue his assistance therefore the eight effect of our predestination is the calling vpon god that in this fight he wold giue vs aide against the devil the worlde and the flesh for this is the propertie of the spirite which the elect haue to stir them vp to prayer for the spirit it selfe maketh request for vs vvith groninges vvhich cannot be vttered that is to say it mooueth vs to make request and because we are sonnes god hath sent the spirit of his son into our hearts crying abba father and god biddeth vs call vpon him in the day of tribulation promising to heare vs from these proceedeth the ninth effect of predestination namelie a perpetuall repentance for our daylie slips and a continuall desire to be bettered in godlines so that also for this cause chieflie we hartily desire to be dissolued out of this world and to be with christ for this end that we might sin no more for this is a thing proper to the elect of god euen now borne anew as we may see in the apostle who speaketh thus in the name of all the regenerate o miserable man that i am vvho shal deliuer me from the bodie of this death and againe i desire to be dissolued and to be with christ from this ninth effect proceedeth the tenth namelie a desire that christ may come amp make an end of all our miseries and sinnes amp perfectly restore his own kingdome that this is proper to the elect the apostle sheweth when he saith that they loue the comming of the lord and john bringeth in the spouse of christ crying come lord iesu come quicklie yes and christ himselfe hath taught vs to pray let thy kingdome come and because that they which pray on this wise are also heard according to god promise in the day of tribulation call vppon mee and i vvill heare thee thence appeareth the eleueth effect of predestination true patience that is not onelie true comfort but also a reioycing in aduersitie as the apostle describeth it and therefore a certaine taking vp of courage and recouerie of strength against his enemy whereby it commeth to passe that al things turne to the saluation of the elect for the elect albeit they be often beaten downe in fight yet because christ speedilie sendeth ayde from heauen vnto them they rise vp couragiously and begin againe the fight against sinne and the diuel and al other the enemy of christ and they fight so long til they be made conquerers amp are assured of the victorie and of the crowne which assurance also is an effect of predestination giuen to all the electe for what saith the apostle shall we say to these things if god be on our side who can be against vs therefore our lord iesus techeth that the elec annot be seduced and so perish no not by the comming of antichrist and his miracles and lastly hence appeareth that last effect of predestination vvhich vve can obtaine in this life the gift of perseuerance vnto the end in faith and a true confession of christ ioyned with a manifest care to liue a godly life amp a desire to glorifie him for this gift is bestowed vpon all the elect as the lorde promiseth by ieremie i will put my feare into their heartes that they may not departe from me and when they shal come to the end of their liues they shall bee receiued into the heauenly glorie vntill such time as their body also being raised vp they may take full possession of eternall life thus we see that it is very certaine that those which are elected to eternall life ar also predestinate to vse those meanes by which as by certaine steppes and stayres they climbe into that heauenly dwelling place and therefore that we were predestinate to these meanes namely faith iustification and good workes because wee were elected to eternall life according to the purpose and grace of god wherefore by this means the doctrine also of the pelagians is confuted as touching predestination to life by our faith and workes which god foresaw we shuld do whereas on the contrary therefore god did predestinat vs to faith and good workes because he did choose vs to eternal life for the apostle saith not i obtained mercie because i was faithfull or because i should be faithfull but that i might be faithfull neither saith he that we are elected in christ because we should be holy and without blame but that vvee might be holy and vvithout blame neither doth he say that we were created in christ becaus wee did or should do good workes but we were created to good workes vvhich god prepared that vvee might vvalk in them lastly he saith not that the grace of christ appeared becaus we were to liue soberly iustly and godly but that it therefore appeared that we denying all vngodlines amp the lusts of this worlde might liue soberly iustly amp godly in this present vvorld wee see therfore that by this doctrine that wicked opinion is ouerthrowen which teacheth that we do preuent the grace of god by our merites which god foresaw and on the contrary here wee see how fowlly the belli god of this world are deceiued which reason thus if wee be predestinate to eternall life and our predestination be certaine and vnchangeable what neede we endeuour our selues beleeue or doe good workes for howsoeuer it fall out amp howsoeuer the elect do liue vndoubtedly they cannot perish because they are predestinate to eternall life alas poore wretches they see not that they seuer those thinges that are to be conioyned namely the end and the meanes of the end and that they breake the cheine which in no wise either can or must be loosed whilst that they seuer their calling and iustification yes and faith too and good works from predestination and glorification as though god did glorifie them whome he did predestinate before hee called and iustified them yes and before they can beleue and shew their quick and liuely faith by workes contrariwise let vs learn what our duetie is if any be elect to eternal life they also are predestinate to the meanes by which they come vnto it and wee beleeue as we are bound to do that we are predestinate to eternal life and therefore wee must also beleeue that we haue bene elected to faith and good workes that by them as by certaine steppes we might be brought to eternall life and therefore so far must we be from neglecting faith and the meanes of good workes and of a holy life that contrariwise it is rather our dutie to keepe faith in a good conscience amp to be conuersant in good workes which god hath prepared that we might walke in them and because wee can neither attaine to the ende nor the meanes that bring vs thereunto of our selues therefore it is our parts to craue them at god hands by prayer that hee woulde giue vs faith and a care to do good workes and encrease them in vs nether must we onely ask them but also certainly trust that we shal obtaine them for christ his cause for if for all them which are predestinated to eternall life god hath prepared faith by which they may beleeue and good workes to walk in therefore if wee beleeue as by god commandement wee are bound that wee are in christ elected to eternall glory we must also be perswaded that before we depart hence hee will giue vs true repetance increase true faith inflame vs with loue lastly that he wil minister vnto vs aboundantly all thinges in christ to obtaine the end yes this confidence also and prayer it is one effecte of predestination by which wee get the rest therefore this doctrin we must hold that predestination to eternall life doeth not take away the meanes of obtaining it but rather establish them and therefore both these principles are true namely that the elect to life cannot perish and vnlesse a man beleeue in christ and perseuer vnto the end in this faith working by loue hee shall perish the reason is because in predestination the meanes and the end of it are so ioyned together that the one cannot be seuered from the other wherfore whosoeuer holdeth not the meanes vnto the end amongst which faith is one it is manifest that hee was neuer predestinate and therefore mu needes perish as on the cotrary he which holdeth faith must needes be saued so the truth of these propositions is euident hee which beleeueth in the son hath eternall life contrariwise he which beleeueth not in the son the anger of god remaineth vpon him because as a constant faith is a sign of election so obstinat infidelity is a token of reprobation

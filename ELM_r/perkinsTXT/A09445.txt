if there bee with him a messenger an interpreter one of a thousand to declare vnto man his righteousnes then will be haue mercy on him and will say deliuer him that hee goe not downe into the pit for i haue receiued a reconciliation in this chapter and the former eli a holy learned and wise young man hath conference vvith iob in matters of high and excellent diuinitie the points of his conference are these from the first verse of this chap to the verse is a preface to his speech from thence to the he repeateth certaine propositions of iob and reproueth them fro thence to these wordes hee instructeth iob in certaine points touching god dealing with sinners and those are two howe god preserueth a sinner from falling how god restoreth a sinner beeing falne the meanes whereby god preserueth a sinner are set downe to bee two principall by admonitions in dreames and visions by scourges and chastisements when the first will not preuaile and these are layd downe from the verse vnto these words then followeth the poynt namely the restoring of a sinner when both the meanes formerly spoken of haue not preuailed with him but that through his corruption he is fallen and concerning this poynt he handleth these particulers the remedy and meanes of his restoring the effect that followeth thereupon the remedy is layde downe in these wordes now red vnto vs then followeth the effect which is that when a sinner is restored by repentance then the graces of god are plentifully poured vpon him both for soule and bodie fro these words to he end of the chapter the intent then of this scripture is that god vseth meanes in his mercie to preserue sinnres fro falling into sin but if they do the he in much greater mercy affoordeth them meanes and helps to rise againe and this is the soule amp substance of the words now that meanes and remedie is the matter i purpose to speak of out of these wordes the meanes then to restore a sinner after a fall is to raise him by repentance into a better estate then hee was in before and that is inclusiuely and by implication taught in this text but the instrument by who that great work is to be wrought is heere in plaine tearmes layd downe to be a minister of god lawfully called and sent by god and appointed by his church to that great duty so that these wordes containe a woorthy description of a true minister and he is here described by his titles which are two an angell an interpreter by his rarenes one of a thousand by his office which is to declare vnto man his righteousnes by the blessing that god giueth vpon the labors of this true minister which is th god will haue mercy vpon the sinner by his commission and authoritie in the last wordes god will say deliuer him that he goe not downe into the pit for i haue receiued a reconciliation let vs speake of them in order as they lye in the text and first of his titles the first title of a minister of god is he is called a messenger or an angell and not heere alone but elswhere in the scripture malachy hee is the messenger of the lord of hosts and in the reuelation the ministers of the churches are called the angels of those churches so that it is apparant a true minister is an angell of god in place amp in the other place the angel of the church hee is an angell or messenger sent from god to his church this cosideration affords matter of much vse the most of vs in this place this sermon was in the vniuersitie church to the body of the vniuersitie are eyther prophets or sonnes of the prophets if thou e a prophet thou god angel if a son of the to be then marke thy dutie prophets and ministers are angels in the verie institution of theyr calling therefore thou must preach god worde as god worde and deliuer it as thou receiuest it for angels embassadors amp messengers carry not theyr owne message but the message of theyr lord and maisters who sent the but ministers carry the message of the lord of hostes therefore they are bound to deliuer it as the lordes and not theyr owne in the first epistle of peter wee are bidde if any man speake let him speake not onely the word of god but as the word of god god word must be spoken and as god word then shew thy faith fulnes to the lord in discharging thy hands sincerely of that message which he hath honoured the to carry god word is pure therefore purely to be thought vpon and to be deliuered then let all that are god angels and would be honored at his angels and embassadors thinke it no lesse reason to doe the dutie of god angels least as many man a good tale in the ling so the take away the power and maiestie of god word in the manner of deliuering it the second vse concernes the ministers also are they god angels therefore they must preach god word in the euidence and demonstration of the spirit of god for hee that is god angell the spirit of that god must speake in him now to speake in the demonstration of god spirit is to speake in such a plaines amp yet such a powerfulnes as that the capacities of the simplest may perceaue not man but god teaching them in that plainesse and the consciences of the mightiest may feele not man but god reprooue the in that powerfulnesse that this is so appeares by saint paule if a man prophecy aright saith the holy ghost the vnlearned or vnbeleeuing man om in he thinkes his secret faults are disclosed and layd open hee thinkes all man see his nakednesse and doe reprooue him for it hee therefore falls downe and saith surely god speakes in this man in which words obserue an admirable plainnes and an admirable powerfulnesse which a man would thinke could not so well stand together first plainnesse for whereas the vnlearned man perceiueth his faults discouered it followeth necessarily he must needes vnderstand and if an vnlearned man vnderstand it then consequently it must needes be plaine secondly powerfulnes in that his conscience is so conu nced his secret falts so disclosed amp his very hart so ript vp that he saith certainly god speakes in this man this is the euidence and demonstration of god spirit it is thought good commendation before the world when man say of a preacher surely this man hath showne himselfe a proper scholler of good learning great reading strong memory and good deliuery and so it is and such commendation if iust is not to be contemned but that that comends a man to the lord his god amp to his owne coscience is when he preacheth so plainly to the capacitie and so powerfully to the conscience of a wicked man as that hee thinkes doubtlesse god is within him article thou therefore an angell of god then magnifie the spirit of god and not thy selfe in thy preaching of his word the next vse is for the hearers and they are heere taught that if their ministers be angels sent them from god then are they to heare them gladly willingly reuerently and obediently gladly and willingly because they are ambassad rs reuerently and obediently because they are sent from the high god the king of kings and doe deliuer his embassy god saith the people must seeke the law at his mo th and good reason for if the lawe be the reuealed will of god and the minister the angell of god then where should they seeke the will of god but a the mouth of his angell the reason therefore followeth well in that place they should seek the lawe at his mouth for he i the messenger of the lord of hosts and this st all christians doe not onely if their doctrine be pleasing vnto them but though it crosse their corruptions and bee quite contrary o their dispositions yes though it bee neuer so vnsauorie and h rde vnto nature yet in as much message from thy god and king and he eather the angell or messenger of that god therefore both he and it must be receaued with al reuerence amp with the very obedience of the hart and soule and this is the cause why a con nient reuerence honour is to bee giuen of all good christians euen to the persons of god ministers especially when they adorne their high calling with a holy life euen because they are angels of god saint paule teacheth that wome ought to be modestly attired in the congregation because of the angels it is not only because the holy angels are present and alwayes beholders of our seruice of god but euen because the ministers which are angels and messengers sent from god are there deliuering their message and embassy rece ed from god and th s wee haue the first title giuen to the minister he is an angell secondly he is an that is one that to deliuer the reconciliation made between god and ma i say not the author of that reconciliation for that is the godhead of the for second person christ esus the for that is the holy ghost nor of it for the glad idings of the gospell i say he is the preter of it that i first one that and explane the couenant of grace and rightly lay downe the meanes how this reconciliation is wrought secondly one that can rightly and iustly apply those meanes for the working of it out thirdly one that hath authoritie to publish and declare it when it is wrought and by these three actions hee is god interpreter to the people then he is also the peoples interpreter to god by being able to speake to god for them to lay open their wants amp nakednesses to confesse their sinnes to craue pardon and forgiuenes to giue thankes in their names for mercies recea ed and in a word to offer vp all their spirituall sacrifices vnto god for them and so euery true minister is a double interpreter god to the people and the peoples to god in which respects he is properly called god mouth to the people by preaching to them from god and the peoples mouth to god by praying for them to god and this title sheweth how great and glorious a calling this ministerie is if it be rightly conceiued now then for the vse of it first if euery true minister must bee god interpreter to the people and the peoples to god then hence we learne that euery one who either is or intends to be a minister must haue that tongue of the learned whereof is spoken in esay where the prophet saith first in the name of christ as heare the great prophet and teacher of his church and secondarily in the name of himselfe and all true prophets while the world endureth the lord god hath giuen me a tongue of the learned that i should knowe to speake a word in season to him that is wearie where note the weary soule or troubled conscience must haue word in season spoken to him for his comfort and that cannot bee spoken without the tongue of the learned and lastly that tongue of the learned must bee giuen of god now to haue this tongue of the learned which esay speakes of what is it but to bee this interpreter which the holy ghost heere saith a minister must bee but to be able to speake with this tongue is first to be furnished with and learning secondly with diuine knowledge as farre as it may by outward meanes bee taught from man to man but besides these hee that will speake this tongue aright must inwardly learned and taught by the spirit of god the two first he must learne from man but the third from god a true minister must be inwardly taught by the spirituall scholler and the holy ghost saint john in reuelation must take the booke that is the scripture and eate it and when he hath eaten it then saith the angell hee must goe preach to nation tongues people and to kings which was done not that saint john had not eaten that booke in the comming downe of the holy ghost the very end of whose comming was to teach them spiritually but that in him christ might teach his church for euer that no minister is fit to preach to nation and to kings vntill they a e eaten the booke of god that is till after and besides all the learning that man can teach them they be also ught by the spirit of god himselfe and this teaching is it that makes a man a tr interpreter and without this he cannot be for can a man be god interpreter to his people vnlesse he kn we the minde of god himselfe and how can he knowe the minde of god but by the teaching of the spirit of god indeede we bee mans interpreter by humane teaching and may interpret the scriptures truely and soundly as a humane booke or storie for the increase of knowledge but the diuine and spirituall interpretation which shall perce the hart and astonish the soule of man must bee taught by the inward teaching of the holy ghost let no man thinke i heere giue the least allowance to anabaptisticall fancies and reuelations which are nothing but eyther dreames of theyr owne or illusions of the devil for they contemne both humane learning and the study of the scripture and trust wholy to reuelations of the spirit but god spirit worketh not but vpon the foundation of the word onely i teach this that a minister must be a diuine interpreter an interpreter of god meaning and therfore he must not onlie reade the booke but eate it that is not only haue the knowledge of diuine thinges flowing in his braine but ingrauen in his hart and printed in his soule by the spirituall finger of god and therfore for this end after all his owne study meditation conference comentaries amp after all h mane helps hee must pray with dauid open thou mine eyes that i may see the wonders of thy law the discerning of those wonders requires a spirituall illumination and the opening of them requires the tongue of the learned therefore after all the studie which flesh and blood and humane reason can yeelde pray with the prophet lorde giue mee the tongue of the learned that i may be a right interpreter of thy holy will furthermore inasmuch as ministers are interpreters they must labour for sanctitie and holines of life in esay the king of assiria is said to be sanctified or set apart to destroy god enemy if there be a certaine kind of sanctification necessary for the worke of destruction then how much more is true sanctification necessary for this great amp glorious worke of the edification of god church a minister is to declare the reconciliation between god and man and is he himselfe not reconciled dare he present another man to god mercy for pardon and neuer yet presented himselfe can hee commend the state of grace to another amp neuer felt the sweetnes thereof in his owne soule dare hee come to preach sanctification with polluted lyps and out of an vnsanctified hart moses might not stand vpon the mount in god presence til hee had put off his shooes from of his feete exod and dare any man presume to come into this most high amp holy presence of the lord vntil he haue mortified his corruptions and cast off the vnrulines of his affections in exodus the priests are bid to sanctifie the people and in leuiticus it is sayde that god will bee sanctified in all that come neere him but who come so neere vnto god as the ministers doe so that it is apparant ministers doe sanctifie the people and in some construction god himselfe nowe shall they one way be sanctifiers of the people another way of god himselfe amp no way of themselues surely if it bee so they are but lame interpreters and this is the reason doubtlesse why vnsanctified ministers and such as are of a loose conuersation bestow such fruitlesse labors in the church many want no learning no ability to interpret amp yet how few soules doe they bring to god some it may bee are conuerted by theyr ministery that god may shew the efficacie is not in the person of man but in the ordinance of god but fewe doubtlesse for ought that we can see do teach vs how god hateth him which will take in hand to reconcile others himselfe beeing vnreconciled to god seeing then ministers are god interpreters to the people to declare amp publish theyr reconciliation with god amp that they cannot be reconciled vnlesse they be sanctified and can so hardly be sanctified by the ministerie of an vnsanctified man let therefore all true ministers of god first be god interpreters to their owne consciences and their owne soules interpreters to god then shall they knowe more perfectly how to discharge the office of true interpreters between god amp his people and thus wee haue the two titles of a true minister now it followeth in the text heere is the second part of this d scription which is by the rarenes or scarcenesse of good ministers which is layd downe in a very strange phrase namely that a true minister one that is a right angel amp a true interpreter is no comon or ordinarie man but thin sowne one of many nay one of a thousand the meaning heereof is to be conceiued either properly or figuratiuely in the figuratiue sence it is spoken in relation to ministers themselues in the proper senee it hath a comparison with all man the figuratiue and hyperbolicall sence is that of all the ministers in the worlde not one of many is a right angel and a true interpreter the plaine amp proper sence is that amongst the man of this worlde there is not one of a thousand which prooues a true minister for this poynt let vs examine the truth of it the reasons of it and the vse of it the truth hereof is manifest by the experience of all ages wherein it is strange to obserue how few man of any sort especially of the better sort after the calling of a minister and which is more strange howe fewe of those that are ministers in name and title doe deserue these honourable names of an angel amp an interpreter and the truth is too manifest in common practise to insist much vppon it rather therefore let vs see the reasons of it and they be these principall first the cotempt that lieth on that calling it being alwayes hated by wicked and prophane man because it discouers their filthynes and vnmaskes their hipocrisie and their doctrine oftimes is a fretting corrasiue to their conscience that they cannot welter and wallowe so quietly and secretly in their sinnes as otherwise they would therefore is it that they spurne both against the calling and the man and watch them narrowly amp take hold of their least infirmities thereby to disgrace them iudging that to cast contempt on that calling is to remooue shame from their owne shamefull courses nor is it possible but that they should thus hate this calling inasmuch as they hate so deadly both that lawe and embassy which they bring and that god whose embassaders they are this hatred and disgrace in the wicked world was that that caused ieremie to cry w e is me and made him in the seeming of his naturall reason curse the time that euer he was a prophet for saith he i am a man of contention euery man is at strife and enemity with me the next reason is the difficulty of discharging the duties of his calling to stand in god presence to enter into the holy of holiest to goe between god and his people to be god mouth to the people and the peoples to god to be the interpreter of the eternall lawe of the old testament and the euerlasting gospell of the new to stand in the rome and to beare the office of christ himselfe to take the care and charge of soules these considerations are so many amazements to the consciences of such man who doe with reuerence approch and not with rashnes rush vnto his sacred seate this made saint paule cry out who is sufficient for these things and if paule sayd who is no maruell though many a man say i am not sufficient and doe therefore drawe their neckes from this yoke and their hands from this plough vntil god himselfe or his church doe presse them to it the last reason is more peculiar to this of the new testament namely want of maintenance and preferment for them that labor in this calling man are flesh and bloud and in that respect must bee allured amp wonne to embrace this vocation by some arguments which may perswade flesh and bloud the world hath in all ages beene negligent heerein and therefore god in his lawe tooke such strick orders for the maintenance of the leuits but especially now vnder the gospell this calling is vnprouided for when it deserues best of all to be rewarded certainly it were a worthy christian pollicy to propound good preferments to this calling that thereby man of the worthiest gifts might bee wonne vnto it and the want heereof is cause why so many young man of speciall parts and greatest hope turne to other vocations and especially to the lawe wherein at this day the greatest part of the finest wits of our kingdome are imploied and why but because they haue all the meanes to rise whereas the ministerie for the most part yeildeth nothing but a plaine way to beggery this is a great blemish in our church and surely i wish the papists those children of this world were not wiser in this kind in this point then the church of god the reformation heereof is a worke worth the labour of prince and people and speciall care is to be had in it els it will not bee reformed for doubtlesse had not god himselfe in the old testament taken such straight orders for the liuings of the leuits they had beene put to no lesse extremities then is the ministerie of this age and this reason added to the other makes them perfect and all put together make a reason infallible for who will vndergoe so vile contempt and vndertake so great a charge for no reward and where there is so great contempt so heauy a burthen and so meane a reward what maruell if a good minister bee one of a thousand now let vs make vse of this doctrine the vse is manifold and yeilds instructions to many sorts of people first rulers and magistrats are heere taught if good ministers be so scarce therefore to maintaine and increase and doe all good they can to the schooles of the prophets to vniuersities colledges and schooles of good learning which are the seminaries of the ministerie heerein the example of samuell is very worthy to be followed in whose dayes the schooles of the prophets florished and euen saule himselfe though he did much hurt in israell yet when hee came to the schooles of the prophets his hard hart relented hee could doe them no hurt nay hee p t of robes and prophecied amongst them so should all christians princes and magistrates aduance these schooles and see them both well maintained and well stored the reason is euident and forcible a good minister is one of a if therefore they would haue the number increased maintaine the seminaries and againe if antichrist to vphold his kingdome the kingdome of sathan bee so carefull heerein to erect colledges and indowe them with liuing to be seminaries for his sinagogue and vse so great meanes to sowe his rares in the harts of young man that so they may sowe them in the harts of the people abroad shall not christian princes bee as carefull or rather much more zealous for the increasing of the number of goldly ministers shall baal haue his prophets and god haue his elijah alone great shame must it be to a ab or to any king whose kingdome is in that estate the iesuits diligence is such in teaching amp the readines of some of their nouices such in learning the devil himselfe doubtlesse putting to his helpe withall that in three yeares as some of them say of themselues they proceede in humane learning and in the fourth in diuinitie which if it be so then it may be a good lesson for these our schooles of learning and an inducement to moue all that haue the gouernement thereof to labour to aduance learning by all good meanes and to giue it more speedy passage and it may shame some that spend so many yeares in the vniuersitie and yet alas for all that prooue not one of a in these our schooles are by god mercy many young trees planted by the river side of this goodly orchard which by good ordring and dressing may prooue goodly trees in the temple of god amp strong pillers in the church but they are like tender plants and must be cherished princes and great man by allowing maintenance and the gouernours by stablishing good orders and looking carefully to their execution must see that these plants haue sufficient moisture to growe speedily to perfect ripenes and that then they be transplanted in due time into the church and common wealth these bee the trees spoken of in ezechiell which growe by the sides of that river which floweth out of the sanctuary water out of the sanctuarie must norish them and so they growe vnto their perfection but take away these water take away the liberalitie of princes and good discipline from the vniuersities and these trees must needes decay and weather which if they doe then the small number of good ministers will bee fewer and fewer and of one of a there will not bee one of in the next place ministers themselues are heere taught first if good ministers be so scarce then let euery man feare to make them fewer then they bee euery man therefore for himselfe labour first for ability then for conscience to discharge his duty namely to be an angell to deliuer faithfully god embassy and a true interpreter between god and his people thus if thou doost then howsoeuer the number of good ministers is small yet it shall be nothing smaller for thee if they bee so fewe labour to increase them for the more they are the lesse burden lieth vppon each particular man therefore let euery minister by his teaching and by his conuersation labour so to honour his calling that hee may thereby allure and drawe others to a loue and liking thereof are good ministers so thinne sowne are there so few of them then let all good and godly ministers giue the right hand of fellowship one to another and ioyne together in loue amp by that meanes arme theselues against the scorne and contempt of the world we see they that are of a kinred or a brotherhood or any kind of societie the fewer they are the more closelie doe they combine the more firmly doe they holde together against all foreign force so ought god ministers to doe because theyr number is so small if they were many lesse danger in their disvnion but seeing they are so fewe the more it concerneth them to cut off contentions and all occasions of debate and to ioyne hand in hand against these common aduersaries in the third place young students are heere taught seeing a true minister is but one of a thousand that therfore they bend theyr studies and theyr thoughts to the ministerie for they wel know it is an old prouerbe the best thinges are hard to come by amp certainly there are so few good ministers because the holy ministerie in it self is so high amp excellent a calling amp as it is a shame to the man that there are so fewe good ministers so it is a comendation to the calling whose honour and excellencie is such that as wee see heere scarce one of a thousand attaines vnto it therfore man of the most excellent gifts are heere inuited to dedicate themselues vnto the most excellent vocation yes very reason it selfe would vrge a man to be one of a thousand and further as they are to intende this calling as the most rare and excellent so this must teach them likewise to hasten to furnish themselues with all good helps and meanes that they may become true ministers and able jnterpreters amp not too long to stick in those studies which keep a man from the practise of this high function for it is not to liue in the vniuersity or in the colledge amp to study though a man neuer so fast deuoure vp learning but to be a good minister is that that makes a man one of a thousand in the last place hearers are heere taught theyr dutie first to respect with reuerence the person and to receiue with reuerence the message of euery true messenger seeing it is so rare a thing to find a true minister for as nothing is more vile or base then an euill and leude minister vvhom christ compares to salt which hath lost his sauour which is good for nothing but to bee cast out amp troden downe of man so is there none worthy of more loue and reuerence the a holy minister for as esay saith theyr very feete are beautifull which bring glad tydings and we should kisse theyr feete which bring newes of peace therefore all good christians are to receiue and vse a good minister as saint paule saith the galathians did him euen as an angel of god hast thou then a godly pastor run to him for conference for comfort for counsell vse his company frequent his sermons account him worthy of double honour thinke it no small or ordinary blessing for thou hast one of a thousand and blesse god for bestowing his mercy to thee which he hath denied to so many others for some haue no minister some haue a minister and yet alas he is not one of a thousand and further all man that are fathers may heere learne to consecrate their children to god in the seruice of the ministerie considering that it is so rare amp excellent a thing to be a good minister nay that man should thinke himselfe happie and honoured of god who may be father to such a son as shall proue one of a thousand in a worde to conclude this poynt all man must heere learne seeing good ministers are so scarce to pray the lorde of the haruest to thrust out more labourers into his haruest and for those that are called alreadie that god would make them faithfull in that high function and as elisha craueth of elijah that the good spirit may be doubled and trebled vpon them that so the number may be encresed and thus wee haue the truth the reason and the vse of this that a good minister is one of a thousand it followeth to declare vnto man his righteousnes heere is the third part of the description of a minister that is by his office to declare vnto man his righteousnes that is when a poore sinner by his sinnes the foulenes whereof he seeth and the burden whereof he feeleth is brought downe as it were to the very gates of hell when this sinner by the preaching of the lavve is brought to a true sight of this misery and again by preaching the gospel is brought to lay hold on iesus christ then it is the proper office of a minister to declare vnto that man his righteousnes namely that though in himselfe he be as ill amp as foule as sinne can make him amp as the law can discouer him to be yet in christ he is righteous amp iust and by christ so iustified as hee is no more a sinner in the presence amp account of god this is the righteousnes of a christian man this is the iustification of a sinner and to declare this righteousnes to him that repents and belieues is the proper dutie of a true minister in the acts paule saith of himselfe that he witnessed to the iewes amp to the gentiles the repentance towards god and fayth towards our lord iesus christ in vvhich words is layde downe the complete dutie of a minister as he is a publick angell or interpreter first to preach repentance which a man must performe to god whom by his sinnes he hath grieuously offended secondly to preach faith in christ and free forgiuenes and perfect saluation through that faith in christ to all that shal truly belieue in him and after both these followeth that which is heere spoken of which comprehendeth both the former namely to declare vnto man his righteousnesse so that in these words are inclusiuely laid downe these poynts of a ministers calling first a true minister may amp must declare vnto a sinful man where righteousnesse is to be found namely in iesus christ the righteous secondly how that righteousnes may be obtayned namely by dooing two duties first by denying amp disclayming his owne righteousnesse and that is doone by repentance secondly by clayming amp cleaning to christs righteousnes and that is done by fayth thirdly a true minister may and must declare this righteousnes to him that is first publish and proclaime it that it is ready to bee bestowed on euery sinner which will thus apprehend it and that it is able to iustifie and saue him secondly beside a bare publication of this iustification hee must as paul did witnesse and testifie it to the conscience of the sinner that it is as certainly true as god is true for as a witnesse in doubtfull cases is called that by his testimonie hee may cleere the truth so when the consciences of poore sinners are wauering and doubtfull what to belieue when they doubt of this righteousnesse then is a true minister as a faithfull witnes of god to auerre and testifie this truth from his owne conscience knowledge and feeling of the infallible certaintie of god promises vnto the doubtfull and distressed conscience of the sinner thirdly besids declaration and testification he is to maintaine this truth and this righteousnesse if the sinners conscience be yet not quiet against all gainsayers against the power of darknes and all the gates of hell that this is true and perfect righteousnesse to him that apprehends it as afore is layd downe and this is so infallible to euery soule that repents and beleeueth that the minister may assure it to the conscience of the sinner in the word of truth and in the name of god and may call to witnes all god saints and all his holy angels and may pawne vnto him his owne soule vpon it that it is most true that this is true perfect and all sufficient righteousnes thus we see in some measure what it is to declare vnto a man his righteousnes and this is the peculiar office of a minister of god and this is the height and excellencie of his office in the want of godly ministers i confesse that godly christian man may one helpe another in the performance of these duties and that with profit but it is the proper function of a godlie minister to doe it and the promise and blessing belongs properly to him as the consciences of all penitent sinners will testifie in this case let dauids serue for many who when he was cast downe euen to the mouth of hell by that fearefull discovery of his two hideous sinnes by nathans preaching amp when the faith of his soule beganne to wrestle against hell and striue against dispaire and to apprehend the mercy of god in christ then i say could not the testimonie of all the man in the world haue giuen him that ioy comfort and assurance that nathan did when hee said in the word of a prophet and of a true minister god hath taken away thy sinne thou shalt not die what did nathan heere but declare vnto man his righteousnes what did nathan heere but the duty of euery true minister if this be the office and duty of a minister and if such be the height and excellencie of his office let vs see then what vse we may make of it first concerning the ministerie it first discouereth how nakedly weakely and insufficiently the popish church doth declare vnto man his righteousnesse who will let a man seeke it in himselfe where alas it is not for paule himselfe testifieth that his desire is that he may bee found out of himselfe amp in christ amp yet certainly if euer man had righteousnesse of his owne worth trusting to paule had this is the cause why so many of that religion find not that righteousnesse which will pacifie and satisfie their consciences when they come to die and why so many of them whe it coms to the pinch do then go out of themselues and with vs doe seeke for this righteousnesse in christ where both assuredly and sufficiently it is to be found then for our owne ministerie heere they are taught first the true manner of teaching and declaring righteousnesse namely this not to preach the law alone or the gospell alone as some vnaduisedly doe but both without profit but both the lawe and the gospell the lawe to breede repentance the gospell to worke faith but in order first the lawe to breede repentance and then the gospell to worke faith and forgiuenes but neuer before secondly they are taught to bee holy to bee sanctified and reconciled themselues for it is thy office to declare vnto man his righteousnesse and not thy own to thy selfe and how canst thou be a true witnes to testifie between god and the soule of a sinner when thy owne soule knoweth not nor feeleth the truth of it certainly such man a e but lame witnesses between god and the sinners soule dauid saith to the sinner i will instruct thee in the way wherein thou shalt goe but he first of all in the same sets downe his owne experience in a large story of his owne repentance and of god mercy on himselfe and though god sometime doe satisfie and saue the poore distressed soule of a sinner by the testimonie of such man to teach vs that the vertue is not in the man but in the truth of god couenant yet alas how fewe are they to teach vs how pleasing it is vnto him when a minister is a declarer of that righteous to others which he first hath himselfe and is a witnes of truth to others which he first knoweth in his owne experience thirdly the consideration of this high excellencie of their calling must arme all true ministers against the scorne and contempt of the world which by wicked man is cast like dust and mire into the face of ministers let this suffice them they are the man that must declare vnto man his righteousnesse euen he that scornes and contemnes the ministerie he hath no righteousnesse in him vnlesse it be by the meanes of a poore minister then doe thou thy duety and he that mockes thee hath cause to honour thee and let this encourage students to consecrate themselues to the ministerie for what calling hath so high an office as this to declare vnto man his righteousnesse and assuredly how euer in this wicked world thou article little accounted of for if it did not so it were not wicked yet thou article honored in the harts of all god children and euen in the consciences of some whose tongues doe smite thee and the soules of thousands when they die shall blesse thee who in their liues cared not for thee and the deuill himselfe doth enuy amp the holy angels themselues doe wonder at the excellencie of thy calling in that thou hast power to declare vnto man his righteousnesses in the next place hearers may heere learne first if their righteousnesse bee thus to be declared as afore then if they will haue it they must seeke it as it may bee found namely both in the lawe and in the gospell and not in the gospell alone and first in the lawe then in the gospell for he must neuer looke to tast the sweetnes of the gospell which hath not first swallowed the better pills of the lawe if therefore thou wouldst bee declared righteous by the gospell bee content first to bee pronounced miserable by the lawe if thou wouldst be declared righteous in christ then be content first to bee pronounced sinfull and vnrighteous in thy selfe secondly all man may heere learne how they are to esteeme of god ministers and what reuerence and obedience is due to their persons and their doctrine these are they which must declare vnto thee thy righteousnesse if thou hast any article thou beholden to him who when thou hast lost a iewell which was all thy wealth can tell thee where it is and helpe thee to it againe or to him who when thy cause is in triall at the barre will pleade it for thee or to him who when thy health is lost can tell thee how to get it againe then behold how thou article beholden to a godly minister who when adam had lost both himselfe and thee that iewell of righteousnesse which was and is the whole wealth of thy soule can truly tell thee where it is and howe it is to be had againe and who when the deuill haleth thee to the barre of god iustice to receaue triall for thy sinnes can drawe thee there such a declaration as the deuill himselfe shall not bee able to answere and who when thy soule is sicke to death amp euen to damnation can heale the deadly wounds thereof a good minister therefore is worthy as the apostle saith of double honour whose duty we see is to declare vnto man his righteousnesse and to conclude this point also the consideration of the height of this office of a minister may encourage fathers to dedicate their sonnes to this holy calling for the phisitions care for the body or the lawyer for thy cause are both inferior duties to this of the minister a good lawyer may be one of te e a good phisition one of a good man one of but a good minister is one of a a good lawyer may declare the true state of thy cause a good phisition may declare the true state of thy body no calling no man can declare vnto thee thy righteousnesse but a true minister and thus wee see the office or function of a minister now followeth the blessing the fourth generall part of this discription is the blessing which god giueth to the labours and function of a true minister then that is when a man by the preaching of the lawe is brought to true humiliation and repentance and by the preaching of the gospell to true faith in the messias then wil hee that is god haue mercy on him that is on the penitent and beleeuing sinner behold heere the admirable simpathy and the cooperation of god and the ministers office man preacheth and god blesseth man worketh on the hart and god giues grace a minister declares vnto man his righteousnesse and god saith so be it he shall be righteous a minister pronounceth mercy to a penitent sinner and forthwith god hath mercy on him heere we see the great and glorious account which god makes of the word of his ministers by them truly taught and rightly applied namely that he as it were tieth his blessing vnto it for ordinarily till a man knowe his righteousnesse by the meanes of an interpreter god hath not mercy on him but as soon as he doth knowe it then as wee see heere god will haue mercy on him and wil say deliuer him ampc this is no small honour to ministers amp to their ministerie that god himselfe giues a blessing vnto it and worketh when they worke and as it were stayeth waiting when they declare vnto a man his righteousnesse and then hath he mercy on him so powerfull and so effectuall is the word spoken by a minister of god this is that which christ auoucheth whatsoeuer you binde in earth shall be bound in heauen and whatsoeuer you loose in earth shall bee loosed in h auen will you knowe the meaning heereof read saint john whose sinnes soeuer you remit they are remitted whose you retaine they are retained will they haue the meaning of both read esay god destroyeth the tokens of sou sayers and makes v sards and astrologers fooles neth worldly wisemen backward and makes their knowledge foolishnes but he confirmeth the word of his servant and performeth the counsell of his messengers thus god bindeth and looseth with them remitteth and retaineth with them by confirming their word and performing their counsell for example a true minister seeth a sinner hardned in his sins and stil rebelling against the will of god he therefore declareth vnto him his vnrighteousnes amp his sinne amp denounceth vnto him the miseries amp curses of god iustice as due vnto him for the same heere he binds on earth here he retaines on earth this mans sins are likewise bound and retained in heauen on the other side he seeth a man peniten and belieuing hee pronounceth forgiuenes of sins amp happines vnto him for the same he looseth him from the band of his sinnes by declaring vnto him his righteousnes this mans sinnes are likewise loosed amp remitted in heauen and god himselfe doth pronounce him cleere in heauen when the minister doth on earth thus god confirmeth the word of his seruaunts and performeth the counsell of his messengers the vse of this doctrine is first for rulers and great man of this worlde this may teach them to be nursing fathers amp nursing mothers vnto the church whose authority they see is so great ouer them as that their decree stands ratified in heauen therefore though their place be great amp they be god vpon earth yet must they withall acknowledge that in iustifying a sinner in interpretation in declaring vnto man his righteousnes in binding amp loosing their power also is immediate from god amp aboue theirs and they themselues as they are man must submit themselues to this powerfull word of the ministers to be taught by it and to be reconciled by meanes of it and highly must they receiue it for though a man speake it yet is it the word of god this is to licke the dust of christs feete which the porphet speaketh of not as the pope would haue it to hold the stirrop and lead the horse and hold the water to the pope to kisse his toes to hold their kingdoms of him as tenants at will or by curtesie but reuerently to acknowledge the ordinance to be god the function and duty to be high and excellent to acknowledge the power of their keyes amp censures being rightly applied their promises amp their threatnings to be as from god and to submit to them accordingly secondly ministers themselues here must learne when they take the word of reconciliation into their hands and mouthes to call to mind whose it is euen the lord and that hee worketh with them amp hath the greatest hand in the work and that therfore they must vse it in holy maner with much feare amp reuerence it is not theyr owne they may not vse it as th y list and lastly hearers are heere taught first o see how mad such man be which carelesly nd fildome heare sermons but vpon any oc asion fly to wisards and charmers which are he devil prophets for see the difference of hese two the wisard and charmer hath socie ie with the deuill the preacher with god the harmer hath his calling from the deuill the preacher his from god the charmers charme the devil watchword when he charmeth the devil doth the feare the preachers doctrine is god watchword when hee truly applyeth it god himselfe ratifieth and makes it good wherefore let all man feare to haue thus to doe with the deuill by seeking to his slaues amp let them draw neere to god by entring into fellowship with his holy prophets and godly ministers and further if when they preach amp thou belieuest then god hath mercy on thee then learne what reuerence they and theyr word is worthy of which is thus accompanied vvith god mercy and forgiuenes and then learne to heare the word with feare and trembling for it is god word and not theyrs amp when a true minister sayth vnto thee on a true ground i denounce thee a sinfull man and vnder the curse or i declare thee to be righteous and a child of grace it is all one as though god from heauen had said so vnto thee if any man aske but is it not as good if anoth man pronounce forgiuenesse vnto mee vpo my repentance i aunswer yes vndoub edly if it be in extraordinary times or places wh there are no ministers for otherwise cer ainly this blessing is principally tyed vnto the ministers calling for it is not sayd of any priuate mens calling any where in the scripture as it is heere said of the ministers if an angell an interpreter come to a man and declare vnto him his righteousnesse the marke the conexion then will god ha mercy on him and will say deliuer him ampc whence comes this blessing from this promise of god if then other callings will challenge ordinarily the same blessing then must they haue the same promise besides other christians being priuate man though they be sanctified amp haue a good measure of knowledge yet haue they not the same spirit of discerning that godly ministers haue nor can so fully and truly iudge when a man hath repented when not and therefore cannot so trulie pronounce the sentence of the law or gospell nor haue they abilitie ordinarily by their good conference and christian counsel to con rt a soule but to confirme one conuerted but that power ordinarily belongs to the publick ministery of the word therfore it followeth that ordinarily they haue not the power to pronounce the sentence of binding or loosing vpon any man i cofesse in times or places where no minister can be had god blesseth the labours of priuate man that haue knowledge somtimes euen for the conuerting of a man to god amp for comforting him at the howre of death and giues a vertue and power to that sentence which they shal pronounce one vpo anothers repentance but as this is extraordinary amp in the want of ordinary ministers so in that case a priuate man of knowledge amp godlines is made a minister for that time to himselfe or to another euen as a priuate man in cases of extreame danger when no magistrate is present is made a magistrate himselfe to defend his owne life so then as in vvant of a magistrate the sword of the magistracie is put into the hand of a priuate man so in the want of ministers the keyes of the ministerie are committed and put into the hands of priuate man as in dayes of persecution that then they may vvith comfort admonish and aduise and with power pronounce mercy and forgiuenes one vnto another vpon theyr true repentance yet alwayes remember that in so dooing a priuate man is as a minister for that time and in that case but ordinarily and alwayes in setled churches this power pertaineth to the ministerie amp is theirs alone by ordination and to them belongeth the promise and the blessing that when hee hath declared to a man his righteousnesse then god will haue mercie on him and thus wee see also the blessing of god vpon the function of the ministerie and conexed thereunto by the mercifull dispensation of god it followeth and will say deliuer him that he goe not downe into the pit for i haue rece ued a reconciliation the fift and last part of this description is the commission and authority giuen vnto him which is so great as neuer was giuen to any creature and is thus when a minister of god hath declared vnto man his righteousnes hath brought him to the state of grace and god in his fauour hath had mercy on him then god saith to the minister deliuer that soule from hell for i haue pardoned him in christ i am reconciled to him in which words authoritie is giuen to a minister of god to redeeme a man penitent from hell amp damnation not that he is the meanes of working out this redemption for that wholy and onely is christ himselfe but hee is god instrument and christs instrument first to apply those meanes vnto him secondly to pronounce his safety and deliuerance when these means are vsed here is the principall honour of all belonging to that calling and it is the greatest that euer was vouchsafed to any creature man angell for it is a plaine commission to goe and deliuer such a man from the power of hell amp to redeeme him into the state of god children and to make him heyre of heauen angels ne er had this commission they are messengers sent out for the good of those whom ministers haue redeemed and they haue brought many comfortable messages vnto them but it was neuer said to any angell deliuer that man that he goe not downe the pit as it h r is saide vnto a minister nor any man but ministers haue this comis ion to some callings god saith work thou for man build him houses prouide him sustenance to the phisition heale that man to the lawyer do that man iustice to the souldier fight for him to the magistrate defend him to the king gouerne him and see that euery one doe his dutie to none but to the minister dooth he say deliuer him that he goe not down into the pit if this be so then for the vse first ministers must learne heere that if they will haue the honour of redeemers then must they doe the dutie of redeemers they must pray earnestly for the people for that is one meanes whereby they redeeme man they must say with samuel god forbidde that i should cease to pray for you they must mourne for the impenitent vvhen they will not turne to god so did dauid his eyes gushed out with river of water because man kept not god law and ieremie who w shed a fountaine of water in his eyes that he might weepe for the sinnes of the people they must priuatly conferre site admonish and rebuke and principally they must preach and that in such good manner and in so diligent measure as that they may redeeme and winne soules and the end that they must ayme at must be to winne soules some preach for feare of the law to auoyd censure or punishment some for fashion sake that they may be like to others some for ostentation sake to win credite and prayse some for ambition to rise in the world all these forget theyr comission which is deliuer him from hell this should be the end of their preaching to deliuer a soule from hell and what should commissioners doe but execu e theyr commission high com issioners are worthy to be low commissioners or rather no commissioners if they will not put it in execution it is therefore lamentable to see that some by not prea hing s me by vaine preaching show that they intend any thing rather then the winning of soules to god let then all good ministers so preach as they may say with esay behold lord heere am i amp the children who thou hast giuen me and that they may returne theyr commission thus whereas thou o lorde gauest mee this people and had me deliuer them that they goe not downe into ell lord i haue doone it it is the thing my soule aymed at with all my desire and endeuour and by thy mercy i haue effected it accordingly and the rather must all christian ministers seriously intend the sauing of soul inasmuch as antichrist doth so earnestly seeke the destruction of soules by winning them to his synagouge the turke spares no labour no cost to infect young chyldren of christians with his impure and blasphemous superstition the pope and his vassals especially iesuits vse al means deuise many stratagems spare no cost nor labor to seduce amp inueagle young man and the best wits surely theyr care and policie heerein is admirable and yet alas when like the pharisies they haue compassed sea and land to make a proselite they make him like themselues the child of hel and they are so farre from hauing any commission from god to doe this or any blessing promised as contrariwise god forbids them and his curse lyeth vppon them for so dooing shall they be so diligent to destroy soules without a commission and incurre god curse for theyr labour and shall not christian ministers be much more diligent to winne and redeeme soules hauing so large a commission for the purpose and so great a blessing promised thereunto in the next place this doctrine hath vse to the hearers first to let them see the excellencie of this calling which hath a comission and power to redeem them fro hell amp damnation amp what honor is due vnto it amp to let the wicked man see which any way abuseth eyther the persons or the function howe base amp vnthankful man they are to recopence euill for so great a good amp therfore no maruell thogh evil do neuer depart fro the houses amp families of such man and further to encourage all man to giue theselues to god in this great calling for see here what they are euen the high commissioners of god vvee haue in our estate a power delegated to certain man of worth amp it is called the high commission because they haue power to do great things and that man thinks himself happy who can bring his son to this to be thought fit to be one of this commission but behold heere a higher commission a commission from god to redeeme soules from the power of hell amp the devil clawes this is indeed a high commission and so high as this was neuer granted out of the court of heauen to any creature but to ministers they therefore are the high commissioners of the high god is it not then an honor amp happines vnto thee to bring thy son to this estate and lastly this must teach all hearers their dutie to god word namely to submit them selues vnto it for if the minister haue a commission to redeeme thy soule it must be by the word and holy discipline therefore thy dutie is to heare god word patiently to submit thy selfe vnto it to bee taught and instructed nay to be checked and rebuked and to haue thy sinnes discouered amp thy corruptions ript vp if thou wouldst haue thy cause succeede well thy lawyer must discouer the weakenesses of it if thy body to be cured thy phisition must purge the corruption of it so if thy soule be to be redeemed thy minister must see the weakenes and purge the corruptions of it amp though his doctrine be harsh and hard vnto thy nature and the discipline of the gospell seem rough vnto thee yet must not thou rage and rebell against it nor hate nor rayle at his person but submit thy selfe vnto it for it is the message and ministerie of thy saluation if otherwise thou doost indeed a great wrong to the minister for thou frustratest his commission but alas a far greater to thy selfe for thou frustratest thine owne saluation the second treatise of the duties and dignities of the ministerie by maister perkins right worshipfull it is sayd in other nation and written in some of their bookes that there are three disgraces of the english nation the ignorance or that i may so call it the vnlearnednes of our gentry and nobility the be gery of our poore and the basenes of the body of our ministery the first blot our nobilitie and gentrie haue well wiped off since the first daies of blessed queene elizabeth partly by studie at home partly by trauell abroade and i hope they will doe it more and more the second hath beene well l ssened by good lawes of late and wou d be more if the execution were as good as our lawes bee and it were much honour to our nation and more to our religion if it were quite taken away for he that tells vs there shal be poore euer with vs saith also there shall not be a begger amonst vs if there were no poore what should become of charitie for it is charitie to relieue pouertie not to maintaine beggery pouerty may be a crosse but it is no curse but beggery is a fearefull curse threatned on the enemy of god and dauid saith not bee neuer sawe a righteous mans child poore but that he neuer sawe him begge his bread the dayly cries in our streetes cry for yet further reformati n heereof that the impotent poore may be sufficiently prouided for that he neede not and the s urdy begger compelled to worke that hee may not bee suffred to begge happie you or whosoeuer can haue a hand in effecting this blessed w rke wee who can doe little else shall pray for it and for them that labour in it but now f r the third i feare none but the very hand of god can wipe out that staine from our church the bas nes of the generall body of our ministerie whence is it but either from the vnworthin sse or pouerty thereof and the vnworthines thereof whence is it but from the pouerty and base maintenance of our ministerie which was once robbed by the abbies and after worse by some in our owne state and popery that stands so much vpon non dimittitur peccatum nisi restituator ablatum yet for all that would not restore vnto the church her tenthes againe but as popish abbies stole them so a popish state kept them and to their shame some of th se good professors of our religion haue restored such as were in their bands and there is hope that all our professors vnlesse they care not to be accounted hipocrits will make some conscionable restitution we doe not craue that they wold with zacheus restore oure old though it is apparant that the tenthes were got from vs in old time by most false and forged cauillations we onely craue our owne we would aske no more nor willingly take lesse for our whole dutie is still required then why should not our whole due be payd and yet that the world may learne of vs contentednes as well by our practise as our doctrine we would for the present take in good part and rest contented with a part of our owne and some competent portions out of the impropriations proportioned to the quantitie f the charge imposed and the gifts and paines required would for a time bee a reasonable satisfaction to our ministerie vntill our state found it selfe either better enabled or more straightly tied in conscience to full restitution but as i sayd this is a worke of god himselfe f r if man could doe it so many parliaments would not haue slipt it but some of them would haue ete nized it selfe with this honorable name to all posterities the parliament that restored impropriations but till that or some other course as good be taken it is both vnseasonable and vnreasonable to complaine of the ignorant or to c aue a learned ministerie for shall the oxes mouth be mousled which treads out the corne or shall a man goe to war at his owne cost and hath not god ordained marke it is his ordinance that those who teach the gospell shal liue of the gospel but alas how shall the ministerie of england liue of the gospell when my small experience can showe that in one corner of one county of this kingdome wherein there are some parishes or parochiall chappells almost a of them if not a full are impropriate and amongst them i can showe the most parishes haue but pound or thereabouts some li some li some li some pound some not pound yearely liuing for the minister and those impropriations worth some pound many pound almost all pound per an yes there is one worth pound per an where there were but pound left for the minister vntill of late with much adoe pound more was obtained for a preacher and so there is out of pound pound shared for a minister and pound carued for a preacher in that parish where there are communicants of all the rest the crowne hath some pound rent or not so much and the remainder of pound being a rich liuing for a worthy learned minister a competent liuing for and more then some painfull and able ministers i knowe not what becomes of it vnlesse it goe to the feeding of kits and cormorants are not these goodly liuings for learned man and may not wee expect a learned ministerie where there is such maintenance and i hartely wish that other country be not able to showe the like presidents haue the rather made relation heereof that our high court of parliament may see how great cause they haue to goe forward with that motion already by them made for the establishing of a learned ministerie but if they bring it not to passe what then remaineth but to hope that the great god of heauen will put into the hart of the god on earth our noble king into wh se hands he hath put the sword of soueraigne authoritie an irreuocable and vnresistable resolution to execute his supreme power for the reformation of this euill which as maister perkins saith in this treatise may well be called the kings euill for it will hardly be healed but by the will and powere of a king in the meane time this treatise of that worthy man may be a motiue to our zealouse professors who haue any impropriations in their owne hands to excite and prouoke them to a conscionable restitution in whole or in part as their estates may beare or their conscience shall mooue them for heerein are layd downe and mixed together both the duties to be done by faithfull ministers and the dignities due vnto them for their duties and so seeing the dignities of that calling to bee most honorable and the duties so chargeable it cannot but grieue their christian harts to see the maintenance so miserable this treatise i first of all send to you and vnder your names to the world and to you first for as i am sure you loued the author and honored those excellet gifts of god in him so you canot but accept this after birth of his as a fatherlesse child for the fathers sake and for my selfe to conceale all personall and priuate respects in the name of many thousands in the northeren country i praise god for the good done in those parts by your painfull courses and religious care not doubting but if your selues or the like be imployed there to asist our honourable and religious lord president that the multitude of popish priests there lurking will bee daily lessened the number of painfull preachers augmented popery put d wne and the gospell maintained more and more which blessing god grant to that and all other country of this kingdome for his mercies sake amp giue vnto you amp all others in your place the spirit of courage and constancie in these declining daies that beeing faithfull in your great charges vnto the end you may receiue the crowne of life for which he hartily prayeth who will euer rest then i said woe is me i am vndone for i am a man of pollut d lips and dwell in the midst of a people of polluted lips for my eyes haue seene the king and lord of hosts then flewe one of the seraphins vnto me with an hotte coale in his hand which he tooke from the alter with the tonges and touched my mouth and saide loe this hath touched thy lips amp thy iniquity shall be taken away and thy sin shall be purged also i heard the voice of the lord saying whom shal i send amp who shal go for v hen said i here am i send me and he saide goe in the fiue former chapters are contained such sermos as the prophet had made vnder vzziah king of iuda at this chapter begin such as he preached in the raign of iotham amp so forward but before he either preach or prophecie of any thing in king iothams dayes or his successors the lord in this chapter giues a new comission to the prophet amp a new confirmation to this calling the old king in whose daies esayah was first called being now and an other succeeding him god with the new king reneweth the calling and comission of the prophet wherin god doth not giue him another calling for one calling to the office of the ministery is sufficient but he confirmeth the calling formerly giuen by repeating amp ratifying it and this god did to easy not as he was an ordinary but an extraordinary prophet for ordinary ministers need no renouation of their calling nor any newe signes of confirmation but extraordinary prophets who come in extraordinary maner amp to do many extraordinary workes god in his wisdom wil haue their calling confirmed againe and againe amp that by very extraordinary meanes out of which practise of the lord we learn how great cause we haue to doubt those man to be either fantasticall or worse who pretend extraordinary callings in these daies and yet scarce can shew vs any good signes of an ordinary much lesse of an extraordinary motion for if in those dayes when such courses were more common god will haue his extraordinary prophets caling to be renewed amp confirmed againe and againe then certainly in these dayes we may iustly require more amp more wonderful signes of an extraordinary calling afore we belieue it and if god himselfe was so carefull to satisfie his church in those dayes of the vocation of his prophet surely y e church in these daies hath much more cause to doubt in such cases and to require many amp extraordinarie signes afore it acknowledge any such extraordinary calling these man therfore offer much wrong to the church amp deserue both the censure thereof amp the sword of the magistrate who dare so boldly offer and obtrude to the church their own fancies amp dreams as extraordinary motions of god spirit this is the occasion and coherence this chapter hath two partes first the meanes of his confirmation f om the beginning to these words secondly the confirmation it selfe from these words to the end the me ne of his confirmation is a vision he saw from heauen of certaine holy angels appearing and speaking to him in the first verses in the confirmation which followeth in these words are three points the effect of the vision which it wrought in the prophet it caused him feare it astonisht him amp cast him down in the fifth verse his cosolation and raising vp againe after his feare in the and verses the renuing of his co ssion againe from thence to the end the feare amp astonishment of the prophet is described by the signes of which are two a note of exclamation woe is me by a note of extreame deiection in himselfe i am vndone by the causes of it which are also set downe to be two he was a man polluted and dwelt amongst people polluted he had seene the lord then said i woe is me i am vndone the first point in order is the feare and extasie into which the lord d oue this holy prophet which the lord did not in his anger but in his loue vnto him not for a punishment of sinne but as an euidence of his further loue for the intent and purpose of god in striking this feare into him was to make him to be a true prophet amp a fit messenger for himselfe it may seeme a strange course which god taketh to confirme and raise vp his seruat in zeale amp corage to strike him into an extreame feare euen to astonish amp amaze him amp yet we see it is the course which the lord taketh out of which practise of the lord wee learne this doctrine that al true ministers especially such a are deputed to the greatest workes in his church must e first of all striken into a great feare consideration of the greatnes of their nction yes into an amazemet and astonishment in the admiration of god glorie and greatnesse whose roome they occupy and whose message they bring amp the more they are afraide and shrin so it be vnder the contemplation of god maiestie amp their own weaknes the more likelier it is that they are truly cald of god and appointed for worthy purposes in his church but he that steps to this function without feare he may thrust in himselfe but its doubtful whether he be cald of god as here y e prophet was nor is it so here alone but euery where when god called any of his servant to any great worke he first droue them into these feares and amazements as is euident exod amp in moses in ieremy ieremy in act ampc s paul and others the reason of this calling of the lord is plaine namely because mans nature is alwaies ready to take enough and too much vnto it selfe god therfore in his wisdome puts a bridle vnto the corrupt nature of man and astonisheth it lest it presume too much and take too much vpon it self againe a minister is to preach vnto the people feare and reuerence of the lord bu how can he do so to others whe he hat not tyed the lord in his own coscience nor was euer cast downe in admiration of god glory and maiesty and lastly the ministry is a high amp excellent cal ing especially the office of extraordinary prophets in the old testament and is therefore subiect to pride and to be uft vp with self conceits amp therefore eacheth the apostle to timothy that a minister may not be a yong scholler least he puft vp and fall into the condemnation of he wicked giuing vs to vnderstad that it s the peculiar danger of the calling to haue high conceits of theselues because of the height amp dignity of their functio therfore to preuent this incouenience god in mercy appointeth that all his true ministers shall haue some meanes other to be cast downe euen to no hing in themselues and shall be driuen nto such feares amp amazements at sight of their owne weakenesse as they shall hrowe downe themselues at christs eete and denying themselues wholy shall acknowledge that they are in him whatsoeuer they are and doe relye and trust onely on his grace and helpe the vse of this doctrine as it is for all ministers so specially for vs which liue in the vniuersitie we liue as it were in a seminary and many of vs are hereafter by god grace to be framed to the ministery and some of vs already are now here we haue many occasions to be puft vp in selfe conceits we see our selues growe in time in degrees in learning in honour in name and estimation and to many of vs god giues good portions of his gifts what are all these but so many baites to allure vs to pride and vaine opinions of our own worths but let vs remember the end we aime at is not humane nor carnall our purpose is to saue soules then the weapons of our war raust not be carnall as pride vaine glory and selfe conceit if therefore we euer looke to be made instruments o god glorie in sauing of soules then a the first set wee not before our eyes the honour but the daunger of our calling and humble we our selues vnder the mightie hand of our god that hee may exal vs in his due time and let vs be content that god giue any occasion or meanes to pul vs down either by outward cross or inward temptation and let vs reioyce when we are thereby so farre cast downe that we cry out in the astonishment of our spirits as the prophet here woe is me i am vndone but otherwise if we will needes follow the swinge of our proude natures and trust in our owne abilitie gifts and learning let vs knowe we vse carnall weapons in a spirituall warfare and let vs be assured the lord will worke no great worke in his church by our ministerie wee may raise our selues in worldly estimation and worke out our owne purposes but we shal do litle in the saluatio of soules for those man do pronounce the most powerfull blessings on other mens soules and speake the best wordes of comfort to other mens consciences which they oftenest say vnto theselues woe is me i am vndone furthermore whereas the prophet at this vision and reuelation of god glory vnto him cryeth out of himselfe woe is mee i am vndone being words of extreame feare and astonishment and of so lowe a deiection as is a degree towardes desperation if it had gone forward let vs learne that the prophet helde not in his iudgement the doctrine of intercession of angels and saints for particular man for if he had hee need not at the sight of god maiestie foorthwith to haue cryed out woe is me i am vndone but hee might haue stayed himselfe awhile in this cogitation i will desire moses samuel or dauid to pray to this glorious god for me or here are holy angels of the seraphins here present they see in what fearefull case i am i will pray to them to speake to this glorious and mightie lord for me that i perish not in this feare but hee instantly seeing the lord appeare in maiestie and fearing his iust wrath being guiltie of his own corruptios without any hope or expectation or as he seemes without the lest cogitation of helpe or assistance from any creature he cryeth out i am vndone lastly whereas he exclaimeth woe is me i am vndone being words of a soule humbled amp deiected amp hereby sheweth himselfe to be in that case which a poore sinner is when the preaching of the law hath humbled him by shewing him his sinnes and his extreame danger by them we may learne that to bee called to the ministery is to be as it were conuerted and regenerate amp that when a man is called thereunto it is a worke little lesse then that whereby god calleth a sinner from his sinne to the state of repentance for as god first casteth downe the sinner before hee giue him grace or any feeling of his loue in christ so here hee first abaseth and casteth downe the prophet in the sight of g ds maiestie and his owne miserie afore hee honour him with a commission to preach peace vnto his people which i note against those man which hold it so ordinary a matter to enter into the ministerie as many doe which take it vppon them in wordly and politic purposes and some of a better ranke which thinke if a man haue learning degrees and age he is sufficiently qualified for that calling but alas this is not all there is a greater work to be wrought then so he must be humbled amp cast down in sight of the greatnes of that calling of the maiestie of that god whose roome he is to execute amp of the vnworthines of himselfe to so great a worke hee must bee resolued that to call a man to the ministerie is the greatest worke that god worketh in his church but the conuerting of a sinner and calling him to the state of grace nay it is a worke eue like vnto it for as a sinner in his conuersion so he at his vocation to that place is often to cry out in the amazement of his soule woe is me i am vndone as therefore they are foulie deceiued which thinke any holinesse or sanctification can sufficiently qualifie a man without learning so are they no lesse which thinke all outward complements to be sufficient without this worke which here was wrought in the holy prophet thus we see the feare and astonishment of the prophet it followeth for i am a man of polluted lippes now follow the causes of his feare which are two the first is his owne pollution and sinfulnesse and the sinfulnesse of his people his owne he freely confesseth in these words i am a man of polluted lippes that is i am a miserable and sinfull man and therefore i feare and tremble to stand in god presence nay i dare not looke vpon the lorde for my sinnes but it may bee demaunded how could the prophet say thus truely for he was a holy man and iustified in god presence by his true faith in the messias and sanctified by repentance can a man iustified and sanctified say he is a man polluted i answere it is doubtlesse he was so he therefore complaineth here not of any great and enormous sinnes which he had committed to the publicke scandoll of the church but first of the corruption of his nature which in him as in al me is a very sea of iniquity amp which alwaies appears the more the neerer a ma comes to god and therefore did now most apparantly discouer it selfe in the prophet when he was in the presence of the lord himselfe secondly he complaineth of some actuall sinnes of his life and it is more likely of some sinnes of omission then of commission for we find not that the prophet was euer touched with any great sinne and where we know it not we are in charitie not to imagine it so that it ts most probable he complaineth of some smaller faul s or negligences in his ministerie as not preaching to the people at some time when he ought or not preaching so willingly or cheerfully as he should or desire to lea e preaching because the people were stubborne and disobedient or some impacience in his ministerie when the people were reb llious and resisted his doctrine which passio might the rather vexe him as we read it did ieremie the iewes were so stubborne and stifnecked a people or it may be some want of zeale or forwardnes these or some such were the cause of his feare and the conscience of ese makes him here cry out that he canno stand in the sight of god where we le r e first what a tender conscience godly ministers must haue aboue all man am ly that they must make conscience of the great and grosse sinnes onely but euen of the lowest amp least sinnes and he m st endeuor in his calling not onely to be cleere of great crimes but as farre as may be to be free from the least appearances of evil and from the least negligences in his place for a small fault in other man is great in them and that which may bee some waies pa donable in other man is no way in them they must therefore watch ouer themselues most carefully and take heede to all their wayes and for this ende is it that a minister in godly wisedome must often depriue himselfe euen of many things which it may bee lawfully hee might vse least his libertie bee an occasion of euill to others and must abstaine from the least sinnes least euen they be blemishes to his calling and burthens to his coscience and hence is it that a minister cannot be too carefull in his calling in his words dyet company recreation apparell gestures and in his whole cariage because little sinnes are so great in them especially ministers here learne the apostles lesson to bee instant in season amp out of season to preach and exhort to comfort and rebuke publikely and priuately to good to bad when it is well taken when it is ill taken when they willingly receiue it and when they stubbornly resist it when they commend him and reward him and when they raile at him and persecute him for it thus must he be diligent in season amp out of season for the least negligence in his dutie or omitting the least opportunitie of doing good will when god visits his conscience be a burthen and vexation to him as it was here to the prophet and furthermore if these small sinnes thus afflicted the prophet then alas what is to bee thought of those ministers who make no conscience of foule amp scandalous sinnes how shal symonie incontinencie vsurie inhospitality couetousnesse ignorance idlenesse carelesse nonresidencie how shall these i say and other like greiuous crimes oppresse and burthen the soule whe as the smallest sinnes doe so affright this holy man surely when god shall visite the their states will be most fearefull nor shall any mans case be so miserable as an vnconscionable ministers and though now such loose and licentious ministers seeme to liue in iolitie amp without ny feare yet when god shall appeare nto their consciences then will they cry out in fearefull anguish woe is mee i am vndone and againe if these small faults so affrighted this holy prophet and burdened his conscience then what pittifull consciences haue those ministers whose daily negligence and vnconscionable carelessenesse in their places is such as all man speake of and yet they are not touched surely these me are not of so tender consciences as the prophet was and either the prophet here was much more nice then needed or else these man will proue to be in a miserable estate lastly let ministers of care and conscience be here comforted in the examble of the prophet who is there but may finde imperfections and blemishes in himselfe which will often make him cry out wo is me but let not that discomfort the but rather reioyce that they can see their owne weaknesse as the prophet did here if they haue cause to exclaime against themselues they are not alone as was this and all other holy prophets case before them in hauing imperfectios in theselues they are no more miserable then the prophet was but let the labour to be as blessed in seeing amp complaining of themselues as hee was and let euery minister assure himselfe that the more hee makes conscience euen of the least sinnes of all the more he resembleth the ancient holy prophets amp the more likely is he to worke effectually in his ministerie for his dutie is to worke in his people a conscience not of great sinnes onely but euen of all but how can hee doe that to them if he haue not first of all done it in himselfe hence it is therefore that godly ministers finde fault with themselues when other man cannot and cry out against themselues for their pollution with the prophet here when no other man can accuse them of the least crime nay when others doe magnifie god for his graces on them and praise their giftes and commend their good liues euen then doe they condemne themselues and exclaime against their owne corruptions and their owne smallest negligences or omissions are great woundes to their consciences amp their last sinnes and their most pardonable infirmities are sore burthens vnto them for of all man in the worlde a godly minister is a man of the most tender conscience hitherto hath the prophet complai ed generally of his pollution particularly hee exclaimeth against the pollution of his ippes but why will some say complaines hee of the pollution of his ippes rather then of his heart or his hands or any other part of him were they not all polluted yes all in some measure and was not he grieued at them all yes assuredly wee must grant that also but the reason is he was a prophet his dutie was to vse his tongue the practise of his calling consisted in the vse of his tongue for a minister is an interpeter as he is called iob that is the peoples to god by prayer and god to the people by preaching he is god mouth and the peoples mouth so that the tongue of a minister is that part of his body which is to be vsed as a principall instrument of god glorie and more to the setttng foorth of his honour then any other now euery man is to be tryed what he is by his calling rather then by any other accidentall or collaterall courses therefore the honour or dishonour of a minister is the vse or the abuse of his tongue and his comfort or discomfort is the well vsing or not vsing of it the prophet therefore here affrighted at god presence and therefore retyring into himselfe presently his conscience checkes him for his most proper sins namly for some fault or negligence in his ministerie which is the proper sinne of that calling and therfore is it that he exclaimeth against the pollution of his lippes out of which practise of his wee may learne first the vanitie of the papists who magnifie the merites of holy mens workes for if this holy prophet a man truely iustified amp extraordinarily sanctified yet durst not stand before god in this little apparance of his glory notwithstanding all his zeale and courage and conscience and paines and sufferings in his function but was cast downe so farre from a conceit of his owne worth that hee cryed out woe is mee i am vndone how then can wee who are no better but rather worse then hee stand before god in the day of iudgement in the great appearing of his infinite iustice and glorie rather doubtlesse as here the smallest pollution of his lippes and negligence in his calling droue him out of all conceit of merit when once hee came into the presence of god so the due consideration of our so many and foule pollutions aboue his should beate downe all proude conceites of our owne goodnesse when wee appeare before god it is therefore to bee feared that the papists who thus magnifie their owne merites doe seldome or neuer enter into earnest consideration of their owne infirmities and doe seldome present themselues in the presence of god maiestie for if they did then doubtlesse the least sight of their least pollution would make them farre from euer thinking of their owne merites they also tell vs of workes of superrerogation but it seemes heere this holy prophet had none of them and they teach a man may in this life perfectly fulfill the lawe but who can doe it if not ministers and what ministers if not extraordinary prophets and yet isaiah the first and chiefe of them exclaimeth here in pittifull manner against his pollutions doubtlesse if the papists would cease flattering or mselues and not examine their consciences by their owne pleasing corruption but present themselues in the face and presence of god maiestie they would bee farre from these conceits in the next place whereas the prophet complaineth of the pollution of his lippes as of the peculiar sinne of his place ministers are heere taught to auoide that sinne aboue all other and to labour in that dutie aboue any other for the dooing of it is his most comfort the want of it is his most vexation his tongue is the instrument giuen him to honour god if hee vse it well it yeeldes him comfort more then any other duties but if hee vse not or abuse his tongue the pollution of his lippes will bee the heauiest burthen of all they therefore are greatly deceiued who thinke a minister to discharge sufficiently his duetie though hee preach not if hee keepe good hospitalitie and make peace amongst his and performe other workes of charitie and good life for if a minister haue not this vertue hee hath none if hee preach not if he abuse his lippes or if hee open them not hee hath no conscience nor can haue any comfort for that is the principall dutie of a minister though all the other bee required to make him compleate the want of them may condemne him before man but it is the pollution of his lippes which presently checkes him before god as wee see here in this holy prophet the conclusion then is to euery minister that if hee had all the vertues and good properties that can commend a man in the world yet if his lippes be polluted either by not preaching or by negligent idle or carelesse preaching this pollution will so staine his conscience and so burthen him in the presence of god that the time will come notwithstanding all his other good qualities he will cry out in farre more pittifull maner then here the prophet doth woe is me i am vndone because i am a man of polluted lippes it followeth and i dwell in the midst of a people of polluted lippes the prophet not onely complaine of his own pollution but of his peoples also amongst whom he liued and this he doth for these causes first to teach vs that it is the ministers duty to confesse not onely his owne sinnes but the sinnes of his people and to complaine of them to god for as he is the peoples interperter to god he must not thinke it enough to put vp their petitions to vnfold their wants and to craue reliefe for them at god hand but he must further take knowledge of the sinnes of his people and make both publike and priuate confession of them to god and the more particularly hee can doe this the better and this he is to doe both for the peoples good and for his owne also because it cannot be but that the sinnes of his people are in some sort his for this is the peculiar danger of the magistrats and ministers calling that generallie the sinnes of their people are theirs i meane that they are accessarie to the sinnes of their people either by prouoking them by their evil or by not reprouing or not hindring or suffering or winking or couering and concealing or not punishing them or not carefully enough vsing meanes to preuent them by all which meanes and many more it comes to passe that the peoples sinnes are the ministers by communication so that as well for his owne sake as theirs hee is to confesse to god their sinnes as well as his owne now if a minister must confesse his peoples sinnes then it followeth consequently that hee must knowe them and take notice of them for else hee cannot confesse them and this is one cause why the holy ghost commaundes a pastor to knowe his flocke hee must not onely haue a flocke and knowe which is his flocke or haue a generall eye ouer it but hee must haue a particular and distinct knowledge of the state of it and the more particular the better and if the minister ought to knowe his peoples sinnes then it followeth first that it is best for a minister to bee present with his people that so hee may better knowe them and their state and certainly if it bee a ministers dutie to confesse to god the pollutions of his people then wilfull and carelesse nonresidency and all absence without iust and conscionable causes must needes be a foule and feareful sin for how could isayah haue confessed he dwelt in the midst of a people of polluted lips but that he dwelt amongst them nay saith the prophet hee dwelt in the midst among them indeede well may hee knowe and confesse his peoples pollutions that dwelles in the midst amongst them againe if the minister be to confesse his peoples sinnes and therefore must needes knowe them then it followeth also that they must discouer amp confesse them vnto him or else it is not possible he should perfectly knowe their estate the want of this is a great fault in our churches for howeuer we condemne auricular confession as a very pollicie in the deuisers and as a rack to the consciences of poore christians yet we not onely allowe but call and cry for that confession whereby a christian voluntarily at all times may resort to his pastor and open his estate and disburden his conscience of such sinnes as disquiet him and craue his godly assistance and holy prayers great blessing and comfort doth doubtlesse followe them that vse this godly practise and the want of it is cause that a minister canot discerne the state euen of his own flocke nor can complaine to god of their pollutions and confesse their sinnes so particularly as would be good both for him amp them secondly the prophet couples together his owne pollution and the pollutions of his people as the adiuvat or helping cause and the effect for the pollution of a people helpes forward the pollution of a minister and the worse people they are the worse do they make him though he be otherwise neuer so good for euen the prophet though called of god himselfe and iustified and sanctified and a man of extraordinary grace yet dwelling in the midst of a people so stubborne and disobedient as the iewes were hee was something touched with their pollutions ministers euen the best are man and this comes to passe by reason of the corruption of their nature as they are man the nature of which corruption is to apprehend any euill where euer it can be found and to partake with it regeneration qualifieth and abates this corruption but takes it not away perfectly in this life whereby it comes to passe that a minister liuing amongst evil people cannot but be somwhat stained with their pollutions of what sort soeuer they be insomuch as it is often seene that one known to be otherwise disposed of himselfe is found to be disposed to this or that euill by liuing amongst a people so disposed and againe that a minister in such a place amp amongst such people free from such and such sinnes remoued to another place is there found more or lesse tainted with them because they abound amongst the people and yet further that a minister knowne to be faithfull painfull and zealous and comming to a disobedient stubborne froward or prophane and dissolute people his faith is weakened his zeale and courage abated god graces in him dulled amp much decayed godly ministers doe daily complaine hereof and experience euery where shewes it too true out of this we may learne something both for our instruction and for our conuersation for our instruction it here appeares how wicked and wretched the corruption of our nature is which cannot but receiue some contagion from the pollution of those with whom we liue for this is so not onely in them who carry a loose hand ouer themselues but euen in such as looke most narrowly vnto their steps as we see here in this holy prophet who was a man of more then ordinary sanctification how little cause therefore hath any man to extol nature and how much lesse cause the schoolemen and some other papists to giue the least commendation to our pure naturals for if nature rectified by grace bee so hardly kept within compasse alas how outragious and peruerse is it when it raignes without controlment and for our further instruction here wee may see of what a creeping and incroaching nature sinne is which like a secret venome in the naturall bodie so it in the pollitique bodie restes not in the place or pa tie poysoned but closely creepes and diffuseth it selfe into euery part and member of the whole it creepes from man to man yes from an euill man to a good from the worst man to the best from prophane man to godly ministers and as from publike persons as magistrates and ministers it descendeth visibly and the example of their euill life is palpably scandalous so from the people to the magistrate or minister it creepeth closely and ascendeth in more secret and insensible maner yet in the effect it is too sensible for it is alwaies seene that they are something touched with their peoples pollutions sinne is not onely as a poison spreading from the heart to all parts from the minister to the people but as a gangreue if it begin in the foote wil without speedy preuention spred priuily to the hart so sinne shewes it selfe euen from the people to the ministers so great cause is there for all man to stop sinne in the beginning to breake it in the egge to giue water no passage no not a little for let this gangreue beginne at the feete it will not rest till it be in the heart for our confirmation wee are here taught first if a minister by reason of the corruption of his owne nature and the creeping nature of sinne is in such daunger to be stained with the peoples pollutions then let all ministers desire and vse all good meanes to dwell with a people as little polluted as may be otherwise let him assure himselfe to be polluted with them which is both a great discomfort to his owne conscience as here it was to the prophet and disgrace to his profession for if it be a duty of euery good professor of religion to keepe himselfe vnspotted of the world then how much more is it the ministers dutie so to doe and how foule a staine is it to the honour of his calling to bee polluted in the common pollutions of his people it may be therefore good counsell to all godly ministers in the placing and disposing of themselues not to enquire onely how good a liuing such and such a place is how wel seated how healthfull and beneficiall it will bee which are alas the common and almost the onely questions now adayes but principally to regard what a people they be and how affected amongst whom they are to liue if godly and well disposed or at least tractable and gentle and willing to be taught then lesse to regard other incommodities but if wicked amp prophane or which is worse stubborne froward amp vntractable then lesse to regard the greatest comodities and certainly if this point be wel considered of and how bitter it hath bene in the end to many who haue not regarded it it will appeare that this is the best encouragemet or discouragement the greatest commoditie or discommoditie and the best reason either to winne a man to a place or to drawe him from it how good soeuer it be otherwayes they that neglect this dutie and are ledde or misled rather with carnall and worldly respects how iust is it vpon them when they are made to cry in the sorrowe of their soule woe is me i dwell in the midst of a people of polluted lippes and here such ministers as haue poore liuings but good people let them not faint nor bee discouraged they haue more cause to blesse god then to bee grieued for doubtlesse they are farre better then those who haue great liuings and an euill people but as for those to whom god hath bene so good as to bestowe vppon them competent liuings and a willing and well disposed people let them thinke themselues double blessed of god and treble bound to honour god and to doe good in his church and if such man goe not before their brother in all ministeriall care and dutie their fault is aboue all mens and they make themselues vnworthy of so great mercies againe if that a polluted people pollutes their minister here is a good warning for all ministers to be wary and choyse of their company with whom they will most priuately conuerse for as on the one side they may not retire themselues into solitarinesse nor sequester themselues from all societie with their people which is rather a cimical and fantastical then any way a religious practise so of all man are they to be most carefull that they doe not loosely and lauishly bestow themselues on al company as too many do in our church to the great scandell thereof who care not with whom they couerse but all company all places all times al sports and recreations all meetings all occasions are one with them but alas what maruel though such man keepe not themselues vnspotted of the world but proue too offensiue to their calling for seeing the best man canot liue with the best people but they shal receiue some contagion from them how carefully ought ordinary ministers to make difference of man and meetings times and places and not diffusedly and carelesly to thrust themselues into all so doing shal they keepe their calling from much reproach and preserue themselues from much pollution which otherwise from their polluted people they shal bee sure to receiue and here people are to be admonished not too sharpely to censure their minister though hee bee not so sociable with them all as it may be many would expect for it cocernes no man to be so wary of his company and his sports as it doth the ministe and if they would haue comfort and honour by their minister let them be areful into what recreations and company they drawe or desire him for the more polluted the people are amongst whom he liues the more carefull must hee bee to keepe himselfe cleare from their pollutions lastly here people are taught not to be too sharpe condemners of those ministers whose conuersations are not so vnblameable as were to be wished for if they liue ill generally the cause is because they liue amongst an ill people why then should they so much condemne them for such faults as wherein themselues haue made them faultie i say not but our church and state and ministery are to censure such man and it were good they did it more but it is against all reason the people should do so wheras themselues are the cause of it for alas if this holy prophet was a man of polluted lippes because he dwelt with a people of polluted lippes what maruell then though ordinary ministers be polluted with the common and vniuersall pollutions of their people people therefore are first of all to see that themselues bee well ordered and godly and then iustly may they complaine if the liues of their ministers be not agreeable but otherwise it is not possible without very speciall grace of god but that a minister shal be more or lesse touched w t those crimes which are the comon faults of his people and lamentable experience daily lets vs see that where a people in a towne is giuen to drunkennesse there the minister is either so for company or at least too good a fellowe where a people are giuen to contention there the minister hath too many suites where the people be popish there the minister is too superstitious where the people be ignorat there y e minister is no great clark where the people are giuen to any great sinne there the minister generally is not cleare from the same pollution and it is seene that the best ministers and most carefull of all doe complaine bitterly of the pollutions of their people for that howsoeuer it may bee they escape partaking with their sinnes yet they alwaies finde at the least a dulling and decaying of god graces in themselues where the people are vntoward and disobedient if therefore a minister liue with such a people his case is pittifull and daungerous for he walks in y e midst of nets amp snares which are laide for him on euery side and if he escape them i meane if he keep himself vnspotted in the midst of a spotted and polluted people his care and his conscience is worthy both admiration and imitation and himselfe is worthy double honour as being both a zealous minister and a holy man but he whom god hath blessed with a good and tractable people and well affected to the word and yet himselfe liueth loosely and scandalously amongst them a heauy burden and a hard account lyeth on that minister and no rebuke is too rough no punishment too great no censure too sharpe for him and if this holy prophet feare so much the presence of god for his small pollutions and yet liued amongst so wicked and polluted a people then what heauinesse and horror shall be heaped on his soule who cares not with how foule pollutions his life be stained and yet liueth amongst a godly and well disposed people and thus we haue the first cause of his feare his own and his peoples pollutions it followeth the second cause of the prophets feare and astonishment is he saw the lord who then appeared in glory vnto him not that hee sawe the substance of god for that i invisible and incomprehensible b t hi glory nor the fulnesse of glorie for that cannot be endured but a glimse of it nor that with the eyes of his bodie in ordinary maner but in a vision wherein how farre the eyes of his body were vsed neither the prophe express nor wee can well conce e the m ning then is n a vision hee sawe such glory and maies as hee knowe there was an extraordinary presence of the lord of hostes who is the king of glorie at whose sight and thought of his presence instantly his conscience i smitten with feare for his owne infirmities and the pollutions of his people wherein let vs first of all obserue the connexion and dependance of these two causes one vpon another for as they are both ioyntly the cause of his feare so one of the is in a sort the cause of another he feareth because of his own and his peoples sinnes and because he sawe the lord but why is he afraid to see the lord the cause thereof is his owne and their sinnes without which he would neuer haue beene affraid but rather haue glorified to see the lord but his conscience checking him for some defect of dutie in his calling therfore he trembleth at the least glimse of god glory here let vs marke the ground of his reason which is this that man that is in his sinnes is not able to stand in the presence of god this is a generall and certaine truth amp the reasons of it are first the contrarietie between god and the nature of sinne it being the onely thing which offends him amp which prouokes his wrath and iust displeasure therefore as a subiect cannot but be much amazed if he hap to come into the kings presence with any thing about him which the king hates or cannot abide to see so a man cannot but be extream astonisht if hee know himselfe to bee in god presence with his sinnes which god soule hateth secondly sin makes a man indebted to god for as the lawe tyeth him first to obedience so if he sinne and fayle in that it bindes him to punishment and the more a man sinneth the deper is he in god debt if then in this world a man willingly indures not the sight of him in whose debt he is what maruell though a poore sinner tremble at the presence of god to whom he hath forfaited soule and all thirdly sin is that which prouoketh god to wrath therefore a sinfull man feareth the presence of god as a traytor the face of the prince or a malefactor of the iudge for these causes a wicman endures not god presence now god presence hath diverse degrees first god is present to our coscience when we think of him he is present when wee name him or heare him named or mentioned by others and these are the furthest of thirdly god is neerer vnto vs in the presence of his ordinances as his word and sacraments and publike seruice in the congregation fourthly there is a most apparant and sensible presence of god which shall be at the last iudgement when all man shall stand before him in his immediat presence to receiue their iudgement now all these presences of god are hatefull to a wicked man for the first a wicked man by his good will neuer thinkes of god and if sometime a thought of god like lighning flasheth in his minde presently he quencheth it as being a most vnwelcome and burdensome thought vnto him therefore saith dauid the wicked is so proud he careth not for god neither is god in all his thoughts nay god himselfe is so litle thought on by them that they will willingly thinke of nothing that might bring god into their thoughts as namely god great workes of his wonderfull iudgements of whom the same prophet saith in the same place thy iudgements are farre aboue out of his sight as if hee had sayd he laboures to set them farre from the eye of his minde that hee may neuer haue occasion to thinke of them nor on god by them that this is true for his thoughts i haue endeuored thus to proue by god owne testimonies because thoughts cannot be discerned by man but alas for the second that is for his wordes thats too apparant in the sight of all man for obserue it and you shall neuer see a wicked man by his good will haue god in his mouth vnlesse it bee to abuse his name by swearing or blasphemie nor willingly doth he heare any other man talke or discourse largely of god or of his greatnesse and his iustice but such talke is tedious amp combersome vnto him and if hee cannot breake it off with other discourse then he sits as mute as a fish and inwardly either frets with anger or is tormented with feare all this is true in felix the gouernour who whilst paul discoursed of righteousnesse temperance and iudgement to come the text saith in the meane time he trembled and for the third wee see daily wicked man endure not god presence in the church for nothing is more troublesome vnto the then many sermons often praying and much receiuing of the sacrament amp therfore they neuer come to the church nor receiue ofter then the lawe layes vpon them but further then that as the psalmist saith they neuer call vpon god but as for the last that they feare and abhorre aboue all they wish in their heart it may neuer be and therefore s paul makes it a token of a true beleeuer and a holy man to loue and looke for the appearing of iesus christ whereupon it followeth that eue so it is a signe of a wicked man to feare the last iudgement amp to wish it might neuer be and when it comes in deed amp they see they cannot escape it whe then do they euen cry to the mountaines fall vpon vs and to the hils couer vs and hide vs from what from the presence of god so fearefull and so hatefull is god presence to a sinfull man besides these there is another way whereby god sheweth his presence and that is by extraordinary reuelation of his glory immediately which was vsual in the old testament as here to the prophet but now is not to bee expected but how terrible that is to the sinfull nature of man appeares in this place for if the prophet a most holy man whose conscience accused him but of a fewe and small sinnes yet thus cryes out amazed amp affrighted at the reuelation of some part of god glory alas how would they be terrified with it whose consciences are burdened with great and grieuous sinnes amp that without repetance thus we see the ground of his reason how true it is that a man in his sinne cannot cheerefully come nor boldly stand in god presence the vse of this doctrine first of all let vs see the monstrous presumption of such ministers as dare venture rashly into the ministery to tread vpon the holy groud of god with vncle ne f ete to handle the holy things of god with vnwashen hands for what is it to enter into the ministerie but to enter into the chamber of presence of the great king and should not a man looke about him afore he come there therefore if god rebuked moses for stepping too hastily towardes the bus e where his presence is and said come not too neere for the place where thou standest i holy ground then how will god rebuke and checke the consciences of such carnall man as carelesly amp carnally rush into the pulpit and to god holy table where god is present in a farre more excellent manner then he was in the bushe and if they bee so to be blamed who enter into this calling without feare and reuerence then how much more faulty are they who beeing ministers dare venture to preach or minister the holy sacraments without holy and priuate preparation and sanctification of themselues but rush vpon them as vpon common amp prophane actions whereas god is present there in a most holy and glorious maner these man sure wil say the prophet heere was of too nice a conscience but fearefully and terribly shall god appeare at last vnto such man as care not how they appeare in his holy presence secondly this sheweth the reason of the practise of al christian churches who vse to sing before the sermon and after namely not for decorum onely amp to grace the action but to sanctifie and to humble our selues because then wee come befor god presence they therfore doe not thinke reuerently enough of god and his presence who doe by their practise in any sort make way to the contrary thirdly we may here learne the pittifull case of those ministers who are so presumptuous as to exercise that holy function amp yet remaine in their sinnes without repentance what doe these man they approach to the burning bush with their shooes on their feete that is into god presence in their sinnes what shall come of it in the ende surely that burning fire shal consume the the least sinnes amp smallest negligences affrighted this holy prophet when he should go into god presence but these man dare come into the sanctuarie of god yes dare take god words in their mouths and yet hate to bee reformed and doe cast the glorious word of god behinde their backes which they preach to others with heir mouthes these man may wonder at this holy prophets nicenes or else al the world may wonder at their prophanenesse a little pollution of his lippes feared him to come into god presence but these dare doe it with eies eares lippes feet hands heart and all polluted their eyes polluted with carelesse looking at all vanities their eares with hearing and their lips with speaking wanton amp wicked talke their feete with running into wicked company their hands with practizing and their hearts with deuising and consenting to all wickednesse this is the cause why the labours of such man are almost vnprofitable because they dare come into god presence in their sinnes in many places of our land there is by god blessing much teaching yet there is little reformation in the liues of the most but contrariwise some fall to atheisme some to papisme some into foule sinnes not to be named amongst christians where is the cause surely not in the gospel nor in our doctrine nor in the teaching of it but one very principall cause is many ministers come into god presence vnsanctified amp in their sins not caring how loosely they liue in the face of their people and therfore god in iustice thogh he instanstly smite not them with visible vengeance for their presumption yet hee smites the people with spirituall blindnesse that they regard not their doctrine but looke at their liues and doe rather follow the prophanenesse of the one then the holinesse of the other ministers are such in whome god will be sanctified therefore because they doe not so but dishonour him by comming into his presence in their sinnes therefore hee cannot abide them nor giue any blessing to their labours all ministers therfore as they would see any fruite of their ministerie let them first sanctifie themselues amp clense their hearts by repentance afore they persume to stand vp to rebuke sinne in others else let them not thinke that their golden words shall doe so much good as their leaden liues shall doe hurt and they may happe to confirme man that already are conuerted but hardly shall any such man conuert any soules from popery or prophanesse and it is a vaine conceite for man to imagine there is any force in eloquence or humane learning to ouerthrow that sin in others which ruleth and raigneth in themselues our church and all reformed churches may make vse of this doctrine for it is the glory of a church to haue their doctrine powerfull amp effectuall for the winning of soules therfore it concerneth them to take order as well that their ministers be godly man as good schollers amp their liues inoffensiue as wel as their doctrine sound or els they will find in wofull experience that they pull downe as much with the one hand as they build vp with the other but most neerely this doctrine toucheth ministers themselues who must know their case is most fearefull of all mens if they come into god presence in their prophanenesse for as no man is more honourable then a learned and holy minister so none more contemptible in this world none more miserable for that to come then he that by his loose amp lewde life doth scandalize his doctrine and let him assure himselfe that for his presumption in rushing into god presence in his sinnes he shall in this world be cast out as vnsauory salt and troden downe of man with the foote of contempt and in the world to come he shall aboue all man cry out in most extreame torment of conscience wo is me that my eyes must see the king and lord of hostes and so because hee would not in this world come into god presence in sanctification and holinesse he shall therefore in feare and horror bee haled into the presence of god glorie at the last day there to receiue the iust sentence of their condemnation lastly all painfull and godly ministers may receiue comfort not to bee discouraged or driuen from god presence because of their corruptions or infirmities for wee see it was the prophets case but let them still approch in feare and reuerence and be so farre from being driuen from their dutie because they being sinfull man dare not come into god presence without much feare as let them contrariwise be assured that the more they tremble at god presence here the lesse shall they feare it at the last day and when prophane and vngodly man who in this world feared not to stand in god presence in their horrible sinnes shal cry to the mountaines fall vpon vs and hilles couer vs and hide vs from the presence of god then such ministers as in this world in feare and trembling and alwayes in repentance did approach into god presence shall then looke vp and lift vp their heads amp shall say to the holy angels amp all the powers of heauen helpe vs and hasten vs to come into the glorious presence of our god and sauiour and thus we see the manifold vse of this doctrine to our church and ministerie secondly inasmuch as here the prophet in a conscience of his corruptions feareth and cryeth out at the least apparition of god glory the vanitie and false dealing of the church of rome is here discouered in whose legeds amp stories of their saints nothing is more common then apparitions from heauen of saints departed of glorious angels of the virgin mary and that so familiarly as sometime she sang with he in their cell kissed some of them and let them sucke her brests nay of god himselfe and especially of our sauiour christ iesus who they say appeared i know not how oft to one man namely to saint francis and appeared as hee was crucified with his woundes and imprinting those woundes of his in francis his body which they say he bare all his life and that they bled whensoeuer hee would suffer them which he alwayes did on good fryday that he might bee like to christ this and many more such may you see in that fabulous amp blasphemous book of the coformities of saint francis but for the matter are apparitions from heauen so ordinary in the popish church how then came it to passe that the greatest and holiest man in the olde testament were so amazed at the very apparition but of an angell as wee may see in the whole course of the storie some ranne away and hidde themselues some couered their faces some fell downe flat on the ground and the prophets ere cryed out woe is mee i am vndone my eyes haue seene the king and lord of hostes but in the church of rome looke the stories that saint or monke is no body that hath not had some apparition either of the virgin mary or some of the apostles or an angel or christ iesus appearing amp talking with them and yet alas peter iames amp john those great pillers they were as good as beside themselues at the appearing of a little part of the glorie of christ in his transfiguration either therefore must it followe that these man haue no sinne in them which dare and can behold god glory so easily and so ordinarily which is impossible or rather which indeede is truth it appeares that these are but deceitfull fancies and forgeries of their owne deuise to deceiue the world and to magnifie themselues before the eyes of the common people for it is first of all most false that apparitions are so common as they make them for if they were then are they more ordinary in the new testament then in the old for whereas the scripture hath one their legions haue and whereas one namely saint paul was once rapt into heauen they haue that were rapt thither and as that is false so is it impossible that any man cloathed with fleshe can endure an extraordinary apparition of god glory without extreame amazement as is plaine here in the prophet who i hope was as holy a man as the holiest monke that euer was i haue noted this that yong diuines may be occasioned to looke a little into their fabulious legends that so they may discouer the false trickes and iuggling casts of that religion which evil shifts it needed not if it were of god thirdly the people may here learne first in that god presence is so glorious and fearefull to mans nature how mercifully god hath delt with them in teaching them not by himselfe or by his angels from heauen which they could neuer endure but by man who are like themselues and how vaine and fond these man are who would be taught from heauen and not by man who are so ful of wants in the old testamet when the people receiued the lawe from god owne mouth it is said they ranne away and cryed out why should we dye if wee heare the voice of god any more wee shall dye for what fleshe euer hard the voyce of the liuing god amp liued therfore they said to moses goe thou neare and heare all that the lord shall say and declare thou vnto vs what god saith to thee and we will heare it and doe it and then saith the text the lord said i heard the words of this people they haue said well in all that they haue spoken and so from that day forward god ordinarily taught his church by man like theselues amp we see that the beg nning of it was not in iudgement but in mercy vnto the it is is therefore the dutie of all man both to acknowledge this mercy of god in due thankefulnesse and withall to remember when they see infirmities in ministers that they are but man and that if they had not the ministry of man how hard it would goe with them considering that the least measure of god owne presence cannot bee endured by any man inasmuch as god presece is so glorious in it self amp feareful to our nature al man are taught to prepare themselues by holy prayer by humiliation and confession of their sinnes and vnworthinesse afore they come to god word or sacraments for they come at that time into god presence they therefore are not to come in their securitie nor in their ordinary sins vnrepented of least god strike their consciences with a sence of his fearefull displeasure and make them cry out vpon farre greater cause then here the prophet did thirdly and lastly wee learne here the different natures and properties of sinne and holinesse sinne euen the least sin nay a very sinfulnesse of nature makes a man afraid of god presence that sinne vnrepented of doth so appeares in adam who as in his integrity he spoke and conuersed euen in a familiar sort with god so no sooner had hee sinned but he ranne from god and hid himselfe and that euen the least sinnes not repented of do so also appeares in this prophet who being a holy man yet his conscience being priuy to it selfe of some small omissions or negligences in his calling he cryeth out he is vndone because he seeth the lord of hosts but contrariwise the state of perfect holinesse and the want of all sinne makes a man bold in god presence and rather desirous then afraid to behold god glorie which shall be most apparant at the last day for when the wicked shall desire rather to be couered with the hills and ground to dust by the mountaines then to appeare before the face of god then shall the godly whose holinesse shall then be perfect looke vp and ift vp their heades because their redemption is so nigh and iob testifieth of himselfe that hee knoweth his redeemer liueth amp that he shal stand before him and looke vppon him with his eyes thus as guiltinesse driues a man from the kings presence but innocencie makes him bold before him so sinfulnes makes a man auoid god presence but holinesse makes him drawe neare vnto god and to reioyce in his presence then for a conclusion of this point let all man here learne the way to true courage and boldnesse before god namely to repent daily of their sinnes and labour to growe in true holinesse wealth nor wit learning nor autho itie can do this for thee but onely a good coscience which must be made good by grace amp by repentance then shalt thou reioyce in god presence in this world and delight to thinke of god to speake of god to pray vnto him to meete him in his word and sacramets and at the last day shalt thou stand with confidence before the throne of his glory hithereto of the feare and astonishment of the prophet and of the causes thereof now followeth his consolation then flewe one of the seraphims ampc in these two verses is laid down the second generall point namely the consolatio of the prophet cocerning which there are two points in the text the ground amp matter of his consolation that is the forgiuenesse of his sinnes diverse circumstances of that consolation the time then the minister by whom it was done an angell one of the seraphims the manner how he did it speedily he flewe the instrument or outward signe a coale from the alter the outward action or application of it he touched his lips the matter of the consolation is last in order let vs therefore first speake of the circumstances the first circumstance is the time when this prophet was comforted and raised from his feare then saith the text that is after his feare and astonishment but not afore thus dealt god alwaies with all his saints he bestoweth no graces on them pertaining to saluation but after he hath by some meanes or other brought them to true humiliation in themselues and to sorrow for their sins humiliation is the preparatiue for grace for when by sight and sence of their sinnes and their owne misery by sin hee hath euen driuen them quite out of themselues finding nothing in themselues but cause of feare and astonishment then powres hee the oyle of grace and of sweete comfort into their hearts and refresheth their weary soules with the deawe of his mercy this point needes no further proofe for looke into the scriptures and wee shall finde god neuer called any man to the state of grace or to any notable worke or function in his church but he first humbled them and then brought them out of all coceit with themselues amp then wrought in them and by them his wonderfull workes the vse of this doctrine is first of all to teach all man to esteeme aright of the afflictions that god layeth vpon them in this world comonly man take them impatietly amp our nature grudgeth hagainst them but let a christian man consider with himselfe how god hath alwaies dealt with his children and he hath cause not to thinke so for doth god laye some great affliction on thee it may be he hath some mighty work of his grace to worke in thee or some great worke of mercy to bee wrought by thee in his church and hereby prepareth thee for the same say therefore with the holy prophet i helde my tongue lord and spake nothing because it was thy doing and what god may intend in his so doing to thee thou canst not tell and therefore in silence and patience possesse thy soule againe here is a comfort to all such as are distressed in minde in sence of their sinnes and sight of god wrath their states is not miserable much lesse desperate for they are in the high way to grace and fauour god iustifieth not but him that repents god exalts not but him that is humbled god comfort not but him that is distressed god hath mercie on none but such as both knowe and feele they want it and knowe also that they knowe not where to haue it but at his hands happy therfore is that soule that feeles the waight and burden of sin for to him wil christ bring most ease and comfort god misnisters therefore are hereby to comfort distressed consciences to assure them that if with this prophet they bee so deepely touched with sight of their sins and god iustice as that they cry woe is me i am vndone then euen then are they most capable of comfort and best prepared to receiue it as here it fell out to the holy prophet thirdly here is the way taught vs how to attaine to any excellet graces of god either for our own saluation or the good of the church namely to labour for a sencible feeling of the want of them in our selues for god vseth to bestowe no gifts on any man but such as do in humility amp lowlinesse confesse to god amp acknowledge in themselues the want of them so the blessed virgin singeth god f lleth the hungry with good things but the rich hee sendes empty away and so the psalmist god satisfieth the hungry soule and filleth the empty soule with goodnesse so then if thou be rich in thy conceits god hath not for thee but if thou be hungry hee i ready to fi thee with good things and doest thou acknowledge thy soule emptie then behold treasures of goodnesse to feede and fill thee and article thou cast downe with the prophet and is thy soule empty of hope and fraught with feare then behold euen then god and his angels ready to raise thee vp amp to fil thee with cosolatio t thus much for the time of his cosolation the minister by whom was one of the seraphims the circumstance of his consolation is the minister by whom it was done an angel one of the seraphims that is an angell of that order so called out of which we learne first that there are diverse degrees amp seuerall orders of angels though wee knowe not the true distinction thereof nor thinke it lawful to imagine them to be nor to set them down particularly as the church of rome doth who make many of their owne deuises which they cal traditios of equal authority with the scriptures secondly that these holy angels are the glorious guard of god and do continually stand about the throne of his glory amp attend his holy wil both in heauen and in earth thirdly that they are also by the merciful appointment of god the guard of god children and ministring spirits sent out as it were with a commission for the good of the elect all these points because they are plaine in the scripture and do lesse cocerne our general scope which is concerning the ministery i passe them ouer fourthly here it is apparat that as the angels are sent out for the help and seruice of the elect so specially of god ministers as is plaine in this place where the prophet being afrighted a holy angel is ready to giue him comfort and so ouer the whole course of the prophets and at this day their protection and comfortable assistance is no lesse present to the godly ministers of the newe testament though not in such sencible signes and such visible manner as in the olde for if they bee ministring spirits sent out for the good of them which shal bee saued howe much more for their good which shall both bee saued themselues and saue others also a doctrine of great comfort and much good vse to all ministers who first of all may here learne contentment in their calling for howsoeuer no calling hath more crosses so none againe hath more comforts and howsoeuer none bee more disgraced by euill man yet none is more honoured by the holy angels and howsoeuer in this world they aboue any calling are servant to all me yet none hath the seruice amp attendance of angels so much as they for though wee haue them not to helpe vs to do the outward actions of our ministery with vs or for vs as some popish doctors teach that in their masse amen is not said to one collect because the angels say amen to it yet doubtlesse they are preset alwaies as at all holy exercises and lawful actions so especially at the publike seruice of god performed by the ministers and beside that they are witnesses thereto and of the paines and diligence and faithfulnesse of a good minister they also do minister vnto them oftentimes bodily strength and assistance amp many comforts in their troublesome trauels which they know not how by any naturall manes they come vnto them and as this doctrine doth thus yeelde them contentment against the contempt so also courage against the danger of this calling for what though thou hast mighty man of this world against thee when thou hast angels for thee amp what though thou fightest against principallities and powers when thou hast cherubins and seraphims on thy side godly ministers haue many enemy but if by the eye of faith they can see as well who are with them as with the eye of reason who are against them they will confesse with elisha there are more with vs then against vs the stories of all ages do affirme and the cofortable experience of these daies of ours doth verifie the truth hereof ministers that liue in places very prophane or very popish it is admirable to see how many daungers they haue escaped and plottes they haue auoided which by their enemy or rather the enemy of their doctrine haue bene laide for their liues which their deliuerance and many other comforts in their ministries whence are they but from god protection by the ministrie of his angels afore we leaue this point two questions may be asked not amisse briefely to be resolued first if any aske whence comes it that angels performe more seruice to good ministers then to other man i answere the reason is partly from god partly from the angels first god hath a principall care of them aboue other man because they worke his worke aboue all other callings for their labours immediately cocerne the good of mens soules whereas others do first concerne the bodie and consequently the soule therefore whereas he hath giuen his angels charge ouer all his elect to keepe them in all their good waies they haue a speciall charge doubtlesse ouer all godly and faithful ministers whose waies are god in a speciall manner againe angels themselues as they willingly performe any seruice to the church or to any part thereof so most willingly of all are they imployed for the good of godly ministers and that for two causes first because they are their fellow labourers both for that y e angels amp good ministers are both called god embassadors amp god own servant or officers in a more peculiar manner then any other calling and for that their seruice is so like that their names are common one to the other angels being called ministers and ministers angels as though they were almost all one secondly because the ministers dutie is to conuert and saue soules being a work which next to the glorifying of god and doing his will the angels doe take most delight in aboue any other for if they bee sent out for the good of them which shal be saued how much more willingly for their good by whom they are saued which shall be saued amp if the angels reioyce at the couersion of a sinner surely they much loue him amp desire to doe him good by whom the sinner is conuerted and in these respects that angels and ministers haue the same names and are both imployed in the same great worke namely doing good to the elect therfore is it that the angel calles himselfe s john the euangelists fellow in the reuelation if then they bee fellowes euen fellow servant amp fellow laborers in a more special maner then any other what maruel though the angels be most willingly imploied in doing any seruice of helpe or comfort to godly ministers in the second place if any aske if it be so then what duties are ministers to performe to angels for this their so carefull seruice and especiall attendance vpon them aboue other man a papist would answere minsters must therefore worshippe them and keep their fasting and holy dayes and say their seruice and pray vnto them as to their keepers and mediators but alas cannot the kings messenger or officer be honoured vnlesse he be set vppon the kings throne will nothing serue him but the crowne and scepter so cannot angels be honoured vnlesse they be made god or sauiours or mediators i answere therfore we dare not go so farre least we remember the servant so much that we forget the maister but rather we answere thus seeing angels are thus seruiceable to god ministers it should first of all teach all man to honour that calling with all due reuerence for they cannot but please the angels in honouring good ministers whom they esteeme their fellowes secondly it should teach all ministers not to content themselues with the name and tytle but to labour to be good and faithfull for so doing they are fellowes to the angels and it is a disgrace to the angels when those that are their fellowes are vnfaithfull and it should further teach them to adorne their calling with a holy life for as sinne is that that grieues the angels and driues them away so it is grace and holinesse which makes them delight in the fellowship of man and it may also encourage any man to take paines in that holy calling wherein hee is sure to haue god angels in a speciall manner to attende him to assist him to protect him and to bee a witnesse of his faithfulnesse and who would not worke cheerfully in that labour wherein hee hath the angels to bee in a sort fellow workers with him to doe these three duties is to honour good angels and that minister that conscionably performeth them the angels will take themselues sufficiently honoured of that man and if beside this honour wee would reioyce god angels and minister matter of ioy vnto them then in the fourth place let all ministers propounde to themselues aboue all things the conuersion of soules rather then their own praise or liuing or pleasing of man and so endeuour it both in teaching and all their other courses that the angels may see it and be witnesse of it for if they reioyce at the conuersion of a sinner as christ saith they doe then those man make them oftest reioyce which doe most seriously aime at the conuersion of sinners and thus we see both the seruice of angels to god ministers and the duties they are to performe to them in that regard the due consideration of this point may raise the world to a better conceit of this calling and perswade fathers to dedicate their sonnes to it and stirre vp yong students to consecrate themselues thereto amp turne their studies to that end for no man in no calling hath so speciall attendance and assistance of god angels as godly ministers haue at least if it worke not this in the world yet it may yeeld comfort and contentment to all faith ministers in their painfull calling but let vs see how the angel performed his seruice to the prophet not vnwillingly not lingeringly but speedily so saith the text he flewe which is not so to bee vnderstood as though the angels had wings for they haue no corporall nor sensible bodyes but spirituall and insensible substances the actions whereof are performed with such nimblenesse and agilitie as cannot fall within the compasse of outward sense but the phrase is vsed for our capacities to shew how readily and speedily the angel went about to minister comfort to the prophet for as nothing moueth so quickly to our sense as doth the creature that flyeth and as we say that man doth flye about his businesse which doth it quickly and diligently so here the holy ghost sets downe the willingnesse and quicknesse of the angel to comfort this holy prophet and to doe the will of god where we learne first what excellent servant of god the holy angels bee which so readily willingly and speedily execute the will of their lord this must teach al god servant to doe the like and to imitate them in this excellent obedience and the rather because wee pray dayly to god thy will bee done in earth as it is in heauen in earth of vs as it is in heauen of the holy angels but they doe it most cheerefully and without all lingring therefore so ought we magistrates in their places and ministers in theirs and euery man is his functio is to apply this to himselfe and to be stirred vp thereby to a cheerfulnesse and quicknesse in their duties for therein they resemble the blessed angels amp then their deeds accord with their prayer but contrarywise he that doth his dutie vnwillingly and vnreadily is like the diuel which indeed doth god will and yet against his will and surely vnto such obedience there belongeth no reward but as god loueth a cheerfull giuer so doubtlesse loues he a cheerfull worker secondly we see here how great loue angels beare vnto god children especially vnto godly ministers how willingly they are imployed to doe them good willingnesse and readinesse to doe good to any man must needes come from loue and yet alas all man euen the best and all ministers euen the best are creatures farre inferior to the angels here magistrates and ministers must learne to be farre from contempt of their inferiours and to doe their duties of ruling and teaching carefully though the people be farre their inferior it is the nature of loue to make any man do seruice most willingly to him that he loues though he bee farre meaner then himselfe if therefore princes loue their subiects they will not spare any care cost nor paines nay they will reioyce to doe them good and they will labour to be like the angels who are as farre greater then man as they are then their subiects and if ministers loue their people they will forget their owne dignitie which oft times they might stand vpo and will make themselues euen servant to all that they may winne some and seeing angles do flie so fast to giue helpe and comfort to good ministers this must teach them further first euery one to labour to bee a good minister for then are they sure of the loue of angels and then most willingly doe the angels any seruice to them againe let it teach them to flye as fast to the discharge of their duties to god church as the angel flye to doe them seruice so shall god angels thinke their diligence and carefull seruice well bestowed vpon them lastly this diligence of the angels and their willingnesse proceeding fro loue must stirre vp al christians to performe all duties of godlinesse to god and of loue vnto his church with alacritie and cheerfulnesse so doe god angels we looke to be like the angels in glory in the world to come then be like the angels in diligence loue amp faithfulnesse in this world the wiseman saith he that is slouthfull in his businesse is good for nothing but the diligent man shall stand before the king and surely he that is willing and diligent in the duties of christianitie shall stand before the king of kings in heauen and let this suffice for the angels seruice and his diligence in his seruice now let vs see what instrument the angell vsed the fourth circumstance of this consolation is the instrument which it pleased god the angel should vse to minister comfort to the prophet a strange instrument for so great a worke a coale of fire here let humane reason hide it selfe and wordly wisedome bee confounded to see the wonderfull works of the lord god could haue healed the prophets infirmities and giuen him comfort against his feare amp courage in his calling without means but he wil vse meanes and what a weake meanes nay a meanes that seemes contrary a coale of fire must touch his lippes that which in all reason would haue made him speake worse by god appointment and the power of his word shall make him speake better out of which practise of god we learn many points first see how god magnifieth meanes hee can worke without them and so he did in the creation giuing light to the world diverse dayes before there was sun but since the order of nature was established hee generally vseth meanes not onely in his ordinarie but euen in his miraculous actions and though hee vse not alwayes the ordinarie and direct meanes yet meanes hee generally vseth though they seeme contrary as heere in this place and the same will bee found true in almost all the miracles both of the old and new testament this therefore commends vnto all man the vse of such good meanes as god prouidence hath ordained of any duties or effecting of any thing that doth belong vnto vs to doe and not to depend vppon immediate helpes from heauen as many fonde and fantasticall man doe who are therefore oftentimes iustly forsaken of god and left destitute of all helpe and so exposed to shame and reproach secondly see here the mightie power of god ordinance how it appeareth in weakenesse such are all his great workes in the creation hee brought light out of darknesse in our redemption hee brought vs life out of death in our conuersions hee workes vpon vs by his worde and by it hee drawes vs to him which in all reason would driue vs from him and by it confounds the wisedome of the worlde which is starke foolishnesse to the wisedome of the lord and so heere hee cleanseth the prophet by a coale of fire which would rather defile him and seasoneth his mouth with it which in reason should haue burnd him so great so admirable and so powerfull are the ordinances of god though they seeme neuer so contrarie or so weake in themselues or in their meanes let this teach al man not to contemne the sacraments though the outward elements bread wine and water bee weake and common and dead creatures in themselues nor the ministerie of the word though it bee exercised by a weake man mortall and miserable as others are for that god which can season the prophets mouth and clense his heart by a coale of fire no maruell though hee worke vppon the consciences of man by his word and sacraments and againe when we see grace and holinesse conueyed into mens hearts by the word and sacraments let vs learne not to ascribe it to the dignitie either of the minister or the elements but to the supreme power of the mighty god who can purge the prophet by a coale from the altar neither is it altogether without misterie that god here sanctifieth the prophet by touching his lippes with a fierie coale for it signifieth that the apt and sufficient teacher must haue a fierie tongue and to that same purpose tht holy ghost came downe vppon the apostles in fierie toungs amp it may be that the one is a tipe of the other certaine it is that they both teach vs thus much that all true and able ministers must pray and endeuour to haue a tongue full of power and force euen like fire to eate vp the sinnes and corruptions of the worlde for though it bee a worthy gift of god to speake mildly and moderately so that his speech shall fall like dewe vpon the grasse yet it is the fierie tongue that beates downe sinne and works sound grace in the heart it may be there are some which neede the fierie tongue this shewes apparantly that those ministers neuer had their lips touched with a coale from god altar that is their consciences neuer touched nor their soules seasoned with the sanctifying grace of god spirit which sit still and ee great and greuous staines in a church and corruptions in a state and can bee content neuer to reproue hem as though ministers were perswaders onely and not reprouers but when this comes to bee wayed in the ballance of a good conscience it will bee found that not the pleasing tongue but the fierie tongue is the principall grace of a good minister but to goe further whence came this coale this coale of fire was taken by the angel from the altar of god where was a fire which neuer went out and this fire was that that came from heauen sent downe by god at the dedication of the temple by salomon and this fire kindled by god neuer went out for no man could kindle the like but all other was counted strange fire as nadab and abihu tryed in wofull experience when they would needes offer with it now the prophet must be cleansed with the fire which came from hea n teaching vs that the ministers must haue his fierie tongue from the holy ghost as the apostles were said to bee baptized with the holy ghost amp with fire a fierie tongue is a speciall ornament of a minister but that fire must come from heauen that is his zeale must be a godly and heauenly zeale but hee that hath a railing lying a slanderous a malicious or a contentious tongue he hath a fierie tongue indeed but this is kindled of the fire of hell as saint iames saith the vnbridled tongue is a worlde of wickednesse and defileth the whole body setteth on fire the whole course of nature and is set n fire in hell so then a spitefull and malicious tongue wee see is a fierie tongue but that fire is taken from hell and not from god altar and hee that stands vp to preach with this tongue god will neuer suffer any great worke to be done by him in his church though his tongue be neuer so fierie and his speech neuer so powerfull as therefore ministers must abhorre the flattering and pleasing tongue and must haue a fierie tongue so on the other side this fire must bee from god altar that is the fire of their zeale must bee builded by god spirit and not by the spirit of discord and dissention ambitious humors turbulent amp proud humour new opinions priuate quarrels all these nor none of these are for the pulpit these may make a man fierie tongued but this fire was neuer taken from god altar as the prophets was this fierie tongue neuer came from heauen as the apostles did it followeth this fifth and last circumstance is the application of the remedie the coale which is the medicine is applyed by this angel to his lips that is to that part which was polluted and as he formerly complayned of the pollution of his lips so the medicine is applyed to his lippes here the angell which in this case is made god minister doth teach all god ministers a great point of wisedome in heauenly diuinitie namely to apply their doctrine to their audience in such manner as the circumstances of place times or persons do require some ministers come to an ignorant and vnhumbled people and teach them the gospell which neuer knewe the lawe here the firy coale is vsed but the lips are not touched that is good doctrine taught but not well applyed for that the lawe should first be laid to their consciences others beate all vpon the lawe when it may be their hearers are a people sufficiently cast downe and haue more need to be raised vp with the sweet comforts of the gospell others vse to lay open the nakednes of the court in the country and to reproue the faults of princes and great magistrates before the comon people who haue more neede of the catechisme others bring the catechisme or points of ordinary instruction into the court wher y e duties of kings amp counsellors should be taught in all plainnes and sinceritie others bring their new opinions or controuersall points vnto popular audiences which indeed are fit for the schooles others busie themselues about ceremonies when the substance is in danger to be lost all these haue it may be the coale of fire but it is misapplyed and not applyed to the polluted lips let all ministers therfore lerne this point of wisdome of the angell to apply the medicines of their doctrine to the times persons and places which are infected so shall they bee sure not to take paines in vaine and thus much of the circumstances of his consolation it followeth in the text loe thy iniquitie shal be taken away and thy sinnes shall be purged after the circumstances followeth the ground and matter of his consolation and that is the forgiuenesse of his sinnes where first let vs marke how it and the instrument are annexed together loe saith the angel this coale hath touched thy lippes and thy iniquities shall bee forgiuen and thy sinnes purged as though hee had bene clensed by the coale wher we may note how greatly god magnifieth the meanes which himself ordaineth euen true remission and saluation to the right and holy vsing of them though it come not from them but from his own mercy and power of his ordinance it is therefore no maruell though god sanctifieth the childe by the ministery of water in baptisme and feede our soules in the lord supper by feeding our body with bread and wine and no maruell though the carelesse neglect of either of them be damnation to him that despiseth them seeing they are god instruments ordained by him to conuey his grace vnto vs and yet for all this wee are to knowe that remission or saluation is no more tyed to the very elements or the actions then here the prophets forgiuenesse is to the coale of fire but the maine point is that for the prophets consolation the angell tells him his iniquities shall be taken away and his sinnes purged as thereby hee had said thy sins were the cause of thy feare therefore that thy feare may be taken away thy sinnes shall be forgiuen where we learne that as fewe comes by sinne so all true comfort comes from the forgiuenesse of sinnes this is that that onely pacifieth the conscience and satisfieth the soule when dauid had sinned against the lord in his two great sinnes and thereby prouoked god wrath against him and wounded his owne conscience if the prophet had told him hee had made him king of kingdome more hee had not so reioyced his heart as when he told him after his repentance thy sinnes are forgiuen thee thou shalt not dye so when this prophet was extreamely affrighted at god presece because of some sinnes and negligences in his calling it had bene no comfort to his poore soule to haue bene told thou shalt haue a more eloquent tongue and a more powerful speech thou shalt haue better accesse to the court and audience before the king all these amp all such like would haue beene no better then guilded poyson vnto him being in this case but the happy answere that refresheth his weary soule more then all the world was this loe thy iniquities are forgiuen and thy sinnes purged all faithfull ministers must heere learne the true way of comforting troubled and distressed consciences namely first to drawe him vnto a sight of some particular sinnes then to summon him into god presence and there to arraigne him for those sinnes vntill the view of the foulnesse of his sinnes and the glory of god iustice haue sufficiently humbled him and then to labour to perswade his conscience vppon good grounds of the pardon of those sinnes by christ iesus this is the way that god vsed and deuised this is the sure way that cannot faile some thinke that all trouble of mind is nothing but melancholy and therefore thinke nothing needes but physicke and outward comforts but he that considers in what case the prophet here was or dauid when hee made the the or the psalmes will be of another mind and will finde that nothing can properly trouble the mind but sinne therefore as the wise physitian in his cure first searcheth out the cause and then endeuour to to take it away so the good physitian of the soule must first of all search into the cause of his sicknesse that is his sins and must take them away which if they doe not then al their labour is lost for al the company musicke recreation wit diet nay all worldly comforts amp delights if it were the advancement to a kingdom cannot so much comfort the distressed soule of a sinner as this voice of a minister spoken from god vpon good grounds thy sinnes are forgiuen thee now to lay downe what bee tho e true and good groundes whereupon a minister may safely and comfortably pronounce pardon of sins to a sinner belongs properly to another place in the next place let vs heere obserue how the lord afore he renued the prophets commission or send him to preach to the people first humbles him for his sinnes and then vppon his repentance giues him pardon teaching vs that no minister is well qualified to the holy duties of the ministery vnlesse he haue truly repented of his sins and haue obtained pardon and mercie in the messias ministers labour for qualifications but the true minister of god will labour for this qualification aboue all other for doubtlesse hee shall pronounce most powerfully the pardon of sinnes to others to whose conscience god hath pronounced pardon of his owne in the last place let vs obserue how the preacher being to be comforted before he goe this newe embassy the lord is so carefull for him that rather then he be not comforted if there be no man to do it an angel shal be set to be his comforter amp if ther be not another prophet to doe it an angel shall pronounce vnto him the pardon of his sins let this be an encouragement for all pastors and ministers of god church to labour painfully and faithfully in their places for the goodnesse of the lord will neuer faile them nor shall they want comfort when euer they stand in neede thereof yes rather shall angels from heauen be their helpes and comforters then faithfull ministers shall be left destitute hitherto of the second generall points namely of the prophets consolation the third and last general point is the renouation of the prophets commission in the eight and part of the ninth verses and it containeth parts a question or inquiry made by god when shall i send and who shall goe for vs the answere of the prophet here am i send me the commission renued vnto him the lord said goe and speake vnto this people the first part is a question made by god by way of proclamation wherein he inquireth who shall goe preach vnto this people also i heard the voyce of the lord saying whom shall i send and who shall goe for vs in which proclamation and inquirie of the lord we are not to imagine that the lord was either vnprouided of such as should execute his will or knewe not who were able or who were willing to goe preach his wo d for as the apostle saith in the matter of election the lord knoweth who are his so much more in particular vocations the lord knoweth who are his and neede not to aske whom shall i send or who shall goe but then it may bee demaunded why the lord saith so i answere not for his owne sake but for ours whom hereby he would instruct in diverse points of holy doctrine first hereby hee would giue vs to vnderstand how hard a thing it is to finde an able and godly minister for if there were not a great scarcity of such man the lorde needed not aske this question but some will obiect against this that there are in many christian churches so many ministers as they cannot all bee maintained but some goe vp and downe vndisposed and vnprouided for i answere this is too true in all ages there were wandering leuits in the olde testament which went vp and downe and offered their seruice and serued for shekels of siluer and a sute of apparell and meate and drinke but this calamitie was vpon the church of the iewes neuer but then when there was no king in israel and euery one did that which was good in his owne eyes if therefore there bee any in our church amp in christian nation which goe vp and downe and offer their seruice at such rates it is much more miserable seeing now there are kings in israel and therefore it is no reason that euery man rob the church as it shal please his couetous minde but ceasing to enquire whether thi bee so or no and if it bee so leauing the reformation thereof to those churches and states whom it may concerne i answere for the matter in hand that this may be so and yet the lorde may complaine as here hee doth whom shall i send for the lord meaneth not such as beare the name of leuites or priestes in the olde or of ministers in the newe for there were alwayes more of them who some for preferment sake some for their ease and some for a refuge how to liue are willing to enter that function and accordingly in that calling seeke not the lord but themselues and their owne ends but heere the lord inquireth for such man as first purely doe seeke and vndertake that function therein to honour god amp to gather his church and then in all their labours and ministeriall duties truly and faithfully endeuor to the same ends preaching god word and as god word diligently prouing exhorting and admonishing and shining before their people in good works for such man it is no maruell though the lord light a candle at noone day and make open proclamation to seeke for them saying whom shall i send for such a man is as iob saith one of a thousand for ome wat abilitie to discharge their duties as s paul saith who are sufficient for those things and some want willingnesse to vndertake the labour as god here complaineth who shall goe for vs now to make vse of this doctrine to our church it were to be wished that in these daies amp for our christian churches the lord had not as great cause to cry out in the want of able faithfull and godly ministers whom shall i send and who shall goe for vs but alas this want is too apparant and his blemish is too notorious and it is a worke worthy the labour of kings and princes to reforme it and is a kings evil nor to be healed but by the power of a king for as long as there are so fewe and meane preferments for painefull ministers there will neuer want abundance of such ministers as doe want either conscience or abilitie to discharge their duties in the meane time till god put into the hearts of parliaments and princes to looke to this great and needfull worke let vs ministers learne our duties and first wee who are in the vniuersities are here admonished to look to our selues by god blessing we are many and daily grow more and more let vs therefore so furnish our selues as that when god or his church shall say who shall goe for vs and whom shall i send then he may finde many amongst vs whom hee may send to that great worke of the ministerie and let vs feare to bee such as that god may affirme of vs as in the dayes of iob that hee cannot finde one of a thousand secondly all ministers learne here not to content themselues with the name and title of ministers but labour for the substantiall ornaments thereof nor to be willing to take the honour and li ings and to refuse the burthen and of the ministerie for else let them know god hath no neede of them for had the lorde pleased or contented himself with such kinde of man as seeke to bee ministers for themselues and not for his sake or being ministers doe feede themselues and not their flocke or preach themselues and not christ then had he not needed to haue made this proclamation for all ages haue yeelded store of such but contrariwise he that is painefull and faithfull in this function let him know that god and his church hath neede of him lastly here the roman cleargie are iustly to bee taxed whose number is infinite but it is lamentable to see howe fewe among them be such as the lord here seeketh for their orders of regulars are exceeding many beside all their secular priests and it is almost incredible how many thousands there be of dominicans or franciscans or in some one of their orders and yet amongst the many millions of their monkes there is scarce to bee found one of many who for his learning amp other gifts is fit to be sent to the work of god nay their ignorance was palpable and rediculous to the world vntill of late being by luther and others of our church made ashamed thereof they haue laboured especially the iesuits to become learned how foule a thing is it that amongst so many the lord should haue cause to complaine whom shall we send the iesuits indeed many of them are learned but for other qualities they are fitter to be plotters amp practisers in state matters spies or in elligencers reconcilers seducers and subuerters then ministers and fitter to be instruments of pollicie to evil kings then ministers of the gospel vnto god but take away them and some fewe selected monkes and those but few out of many millions amp then euen for learning also god may cry and call amp proclaime in their monasteries who shal i send and if it be a shame and miserie to a church to want such as god may send or to haue but a fewe then the roman church is shamelesse which shames not to haue so many and yet amongst them all whom god may send almost none in the next place by this inquirie and question made by god whom shal i send and who shall goe for vs the lord would teach vs that no man is to vndertake this function vnlesse god call and send him therefore here are condemned the prophaine fancies of the anabaptists and all like them who thinke that any man vpon a priuate motion may steppe foorth and vndertake the duties of a prophet to preach and expound ampc oh but say they these motions are from god spirit surely they can say litle for themselues who cannot say so much but that cannot serue their turne for if we say contrariwise nay but they are from the diuell or at the least from your owne vanitie and pride how can they disproue it againe might not the prophet haue alledged that with a better pretence and colour then they yet he stayeth till god here call him euen so all good ministers are to stay god calling if any aske how he shall know when god calles him i answere god calleth ordinarily by his church her voice is his therefore whensoeuer the church of god saith vnto thee thou shalt bee sent and thou shalt goe for vs euen then doth the lorde call vs out to this holy function thirdly let vs obserue how the lord saith who shal i send amp who shal go for vs some interpreters gather out of this chapter an argument for the trinitie of persons as namely out of the third verse where the angels sing holy holy holy lord god ampc but it is not sound inough to ouerthrowe our stubborne enemy the iewes and therfore it seemes those diuines are of a sounder and wiser iudgement who seeing we haue other places pregnant and plaine enough therefore thinke it no good discreetio to vrge this or any such place which may probably admit another interpretation least that the iewes finding the weaknesse of the argument doe iudge all our proofes to be as weak and so take occasio to persist the rather in their blindnesse by that which wee brought to haue conuerted them and as for that song of the angels in the third verse where they ascribe holinesse to the lord three times that their repetition signifieth nothing else but the continuall ioy and delight which the holy angels take in praising of god who cannot satisfie themselues in honouring his name teaching vs in their example neuer to bee weary of praysing god by prayers and holy hymnes and of ho o ring him in our liues and callings but to proue out of the words holy holy holy the three persons in trinitie seemes to bee no fit nor sound collection rather in my opinion we may safely collect and conclude out of these words i and vs that there are more persons in the trinitie then one for first god the father or the whole deitie saith whom shall i send and then changing the number he saith who shal goe for vs for howsoeuer god may imploy in the word vs that hee that is sent to preach is sent as well for the good of the church as for his owne glory yet can it not bee denied but that the plurall number here and elsewhere ascribed to the deity must needs argue a certaine pluralitie of pe son in that deitie as in genesis it is written that god said let vs make man amp here who shall goe for vs out of the euidence of which places seeing the enemy of this doctrine must needs graunt a pluralitie namely that there are more then one then wee shal sufficiently proue out of other places and by other arguments that there are three in the last place let vs marke what god saith whom shal i send and who shal go for vs god sends a minister to preach amp he goeth for god then behold here what is the trade and profession of a minister hee is the servant of god so saith god here he goeth for mee and so saith the apostle of himself amp al other good ministers that they are god labo rers and in another place the angel of god appeared whose i am and whom i serue but if any man thinke that either god speaketh so fauourably of them or saint paul too partially of themselues then let the diuell himselfe be iudge in this case who plainely and freely confesseth though he did it not in loue to the truth or them these man are the seruats of the most high god which teach vnto vs the way of saluation let therefore either god be beleeued who is for them or the diuell who is against them but what kinde of servant are they what place or office haue they they are his messengers or ambassadors this is their profession and their place now then for the vse hereof if they be god servant then are they not their owne maisters they haue a maister euen god whose they are and for whom and from whom they come they may not therefore please themselues nor serue their owne pleasures nor seeke the satisfying of the their own carnall lustes either in matter of pleasure credite or profite if they do then euill he calls them to a heauie account whose servant they are againe if they bee god servant then let them doe their seruice to god and expect their reward from god some ministers will expect the reward and honour of god servant but will doe no seruice that beseemes not servant let such man remember for whom they come euen from that god who as he can giue reward so he will expect seruice and as for such man as painfully do their seruice but are not regarded nor rewarded of me as they deserue let the be content amp continue in their faithfulnesse for they are god ambassadors and we know ambassadors may haue gifts giuen them of those to whom they are sent but they expect their maintenance from the kings their owne maisters so the maintenance which the world should giue ministers is like gifts giuen to ambassadors if it come it is no more then they deserue if it come not yet will faithfull ministers doe their dutie and expect their payment from their king and maister god whose they are and whom they serue thirdly if they be god ambassadors sent by him and come from and for him then let all such as either condemne or any way iniurie them be assured that as god is mightie amp powerfull so he will mightily reuenge it there was neuer king so poore or weake but thought himselfe strong inough to any wong offered to his ambassor and shal god suffer so foule a wickednesse to lie vnpunished nay they and their posterities shall smart for it let ahab and iezabel and iulian say if it bee not so and all ages or stories hewe the contrary if they can that euer any contemner and abuser of godly ministers escaped the visible vengeance of god reuenging hands on him or his fourthly seeing they are god messengers amp servant they must not be the servant of man to please or flat or satisfie humour this is not for them that are god servant they therefore that will bee slaues to the persons and pleasures and humour of man they forget that they are god servant and came for him yes they must not endeuour the pleasing of themselues nor the bringing of their owne purposes to passe but in euery motions either made to the by others or suggested fro their owne hearts they must forth with call to mind who sent me hither amp for whom am i come euen from and for god therefore they are to yeeld to nothing nor ayme at any thing but which may be both to the will and for the glory of him that sent them and if the great man of this world doe thinke it wrong that any man should command their servant against their will or expect any seruice from them against their owne honour then let them thinke it reason that god misters should not bee commanded any thing contrary to god will or against his honour and lastly if ministers bee god servant then let them regard their maisters glorie and be ashamed to doe any thing either in their doctrine or liues which may dishonour him that servant is vnworthy of a good maister who seekes not his maisters credite in all his courses and againe if they bee god ambassadors then must they not deliuer their owne fancies or inuentions but that message they receiued and as they receiued it so must they better it and if they doe their duties faithfully this doctrine is comfortable to them they take paines with ioy they haue a maister will reward them they may speake freely so it be with discretion they haue a maister will make it good they may stand boldly in the face of their enemy they haue a maister will defend them and euery faithfull minister may say to himselfe i will doe my dutie and deliuer my embassy he whom i serue and whose i am he who sent me and for whom i come will beare me out and thus much of the inquirie which god makes and the manner of it now let vs see the answere which the prophet makes in these words then i sayd here am i send me the prophet after hee was comforted by god and had his sinnes forgiuen then answereth here am i send me first marke heere what a great change is wrought on the suddaine he who a little afore feared and shrunke at the least appearance of god glorie now stands forth boldly as soone as he is called and answereth heere am i send me so great a matter is it for a minister to haue his sinnes forgiuen and to feele the fauour of god to his soule and conscience here therefore wee haue an answer to two great questions often moued in the world first many would haue quietnesse of minde and peace of conscience and cannot attaine vnto it if they aske how they might to them i answere here is the way seeke it not in worldly wealth carnall pleasures nor humane learning in company nor recreations but seeke it in the fauour of god and pardon of thy sinnes and thou shalt not misse of it thus shalt thou haue comfort in thy owne conscience courage before man and boldnesse toward god secondly many students in diuinitie would gladly be ministers and doe much honour the calling but they finde a feare and shrinking in themselues and thereby an vnwillingnesse to venter vpon it if they aske how they amend this i answere or rather the example of his prophet answereth for me let that man set himselfe in god presence enter into himselfe search his conscience f nde out his sinnes confesse and bewayle them to god craue pardon in christes blood and grace to leaue them and cease not till hee heare the voyce of god spirit sounding in his conscience thy sinnes are forgiuen thee then when god shall aske whom shall send thou wilt answere readily and with ioy heere am i send me and againe many are driuen from this calling to behold the contempt and reproch and daungers which belong vnto it but let those man marke heere the phrase of this holy prophet when god asked whom shall i sen e hee might haue answered lorde i would goe but such disgraces and discouragements doe accompany this function as i desire to bee excused but hee casting aside all such conceits answereth peremptorily heere am i send mee how came this to pas e for certainly the prophet was as sensible of these wrongs as any of vs all for he was nobly borne and brought vp and was of the blood royall surely because hee sawe he was in god fauour hee had him and his commission on his side and he held this for a sure ground if god be on my side who can be against mee therefore doubtlesse those man who are driuen backe by these discouragements were neuer setled in assurance that their sinnes were forgiuen nor satisfied sufficiently that god is on the side of all good ministers and that that calling as it hath his authoritie from god so likewise allowance blessing assistance and defence of god aboue any other calling for if they were they would scorne the storme and contemne the contempt of the prophane world and with much courage and cofort set their hand to god plough and say with the prophet here i am send me secondly let vs obserue how the prophet whe god askes the question sends him not to others nor commends others to that seruice as is to be thought hee might haue done many in the churches of the iewes but offers himselfe heere am i it controlles the carnall courses of many amongst vs in the vniuersities who thinke it sufficient to liue there and send out other man and giue testimonies and letters of commendations to other man but themselues stirre not when question is made who shall goe to such a place or who shall be sent to such a parish they say not here am i but either it is too little a liuing or too great a charge or ill seated or some fault it hath that they will not bee sent to it but will answere god and his church there is such a man and giue him letters of testimonie or commendation and so all is well but for themselues they liue too sweet and easie liues willingly to vndertake the attempt and burden of the ministerie let such man therefore learne when god and his church giue them a calling to answere with the prophet heere am i send me and let all such as are students of diuinitie in the vniuersities marke here the prophets answere not i will bee ready but here i am why takes hee no longer time because hee was now sufficiently qualified where let them learne not to linger and lye rioting too long in their spec da i e courses but when they are competently furnished with learning and other qualities befitting that calling let them shew themselues willing and readie to yeeld their seruice to the church when they shall be called for as an apple may as well hang too long on the tree as bee puld too soone and both make it vnfit for vse so may man as well stay too long as goe out too soone and both wayes are made vnprofitable or at least lesse profitable in the church and to conclude this second point it is not vnworthy to be noted that the prophet saith not here i am and i runne on my owne head but send me hee willes the lorde to send him then where are they who dare bragge of their priuate motions and will runne when they are not sent the prophet might haue said oh now i feele a motion from the spirit therfore i will goe and preach but he stayeth till he be sent in expresse tearms let no man therfore presume to presse into this function till he bee fully resolued in his conscience that god and his church hath said vnto him goe and though a man be neuer so well qualified with all maner of sufficiency yet let him sit still and stay god leisure and let him say here i am send me and so rest contented vntill he bee sent if any man say it is vnfit that a man should say so of himselfe i answere let him not say so in wordes but in deeds let him therefore make proofe of himselfe and giue the church tryall of his gifts vpon which experience of his gifts if he be found sufficient that practise of his is all one and much more then if hee had said heere i am send me thus wee see the prophet would not stirre till he were sent and therefore in the next words he is bid to goe and he sayd goe and speake vnto this people heere is the third and last promise namely the essentiall words of his commission wherein after god had sought for one to goe and the prophet had presented himselfe and offered his seruice god both giues him leaue to goe and further doth furnish him with authoritie both to goe and speake wherein the principall point is that the authoritie of the prophets calling is deriued from god him e fe in plaine and euident words goe and speake and till then the prophet went not so in the newe testament the apostles went not into the world to preach till they had their commission goe and teach all nation and after them saint paul preached not till it was said vnto him arise and goe in all which is discouered and condemned the pride and presumption of those who dare run on their own heads and will not stay till the lord say vnto them goe and speake these man are bolder then either the extraordinarie prophets of the olde testament or the apostles which are the extraordinary ministers of the new who alwaies had their warrant with the when they went and if any man aske why is it necessarie they should haue so i answere the reasons are many first all prophets and ministers are god deputies and commissioners it is therefore reason that they haue authoritie from their lord and maister secondly their wordes nor deedes beare no credite nor haue any power in them vnlesse they be spoken by vertue of a commission nor haue their labours any blessing vnlesse god giue it thirdly these persons haue no protection nor safetie vnlesse they bee god ambassadors and how are they so vnlesse they be called and sent by god and haue authoritie giuen of god for these causes no man is to thrust himselfe into the ministerie without a calling from god and therefore no maruell though those man who will bee chusers and callers of themselues and run when they are not sent bee in their persons subiect to all dangers because they are out of god protection amp their labours without profite because no blessing nor promise of god was giue vnto them for god may iustly say vnto them let him that sent you protect your persons let him that sent you blesse your labours but it will then bee demaunded how may i know if god bid mee goe god speakes not now from heauen as in old time and as to this prophet i answere it is true we are to looke for no such visions nor apparitions from heauen for ordinarily there are none such and the popish church doth but deceiue themselues and cozen the world who tell vs of so many apparitions that happen to their monkes and fryers for now ordinarily god speaketh in another maner to his church for in generall duties god speaketh to vs out of his word and holy scriptures and in p rticular and personall duties where the word in plaine termes serueth not hee speaketh to a man by his owne conscience and by the voice of his church out of this word god sheweth thee the dignitie and excellencie of this calling to be a minister of the word namely they are his messengers amp ambassadors ampc that so hee may winne them to loue and affect it and againe the necessicitie of it that it teacheth the way to sa uation that without it ordinarily god chuch is not gathered nor mens soules saued that this may stirre thee vp to vndertake the burthen this is generall but now particularly for thy selfe wouldst thou know whether god would haue thee to goe or no then thou must aske thy owne conscience and aske the church for if thou be heartily willing and be fully and worthily qualified then god bids thee goe now thy conscience must iudge of thy willingnesse and the church of thy abilitie and as thou maist not trust other man to iudge of thy inclination or affection so thou mayst not trust thy owne iudgement to iudge of thy worthines or sufficiencie if therefore thy owne conscience tell thee vpon true examination that thou doest not loue and affect this calling aboue any other then god sends thee not and if thou enter with such a testimonie not god but some wordly and sinister respect doth send thee and put thee forward for though thou doest desire it yet if the church of god giue not allowance of sufficiency god doth not send thee but if contrariwise thy conscience do truly testifie vnto thee that thou desirest to doe seruice to god and his church in this calling aboue any other and if withal vpon signification hereof to the church and vpon trial made of thy gifts amp sufffciency the church that is maly learned wise and godly and such as the church hath publikely appointed for that purpose do approue of that they desire and of thy sufficiencie to doe god seruice in his ministery and thereupon by a publike calling bid thee goe then assuredly god himselfe hath bid thee goe and it is as effectuall a calling as if thou heardst the voyce of god fro heauen for as in repentance if thy conscience tell thee thou hast truly repented and if thou canst make that knowne to the church by so good euidece as thervpon a minister of god pronounceth the pardon of thy sins vnto the if thou restest herein amp knowest it to bee as effectuall as if god from heauen had tolde thee thy sinnes are pardoned so is it here if thou hast the testimonie first of thy conscience and then of the church thou article to rest therein as in the voice of god and this is the calling that we are to looke for in these dayes by which doctrine as those are iustly condemned of foule presumption who dare runne vpon priuate motions and carnall respects and are iustly left without blessing or protection so they on the other side doe offer great wrong to god and to his church who when they cannot deny but they affect the ministerie aboue any calling and haue approbation of their giftes from the good church yet will not beleeue the testimonie of the church herein but their owne priuate iudgements which in this case is no way a competent iudge either for or against let such man knowe that they oppose themselues euen against god himselfe it being certaine that where the inward calling of the conscience and the outwarde calling of the church doe concurre there god himselfe calleth and biddeth that man goe and speake nowe then to drawe to an ende let vs obserue in the last place with what authoritie a minister of god comes vnto vs and executes his function euen with an immediate authoritie amp commission from god whereby he is bid goe and speake if it bee so let it perswade the world to feare to doe any wrong either to that calling as to those persons who come with so faire a commission from god himselfe but if it doe not perswade the prophane worlde at least let this be a comfort amp encouragement to all true ministers for if god bid them goe he will goe with them himselfe if hee send them he will not forsake them but assist them and blesse them and open their mouthes and enlarge their hearts and harden their foreheads and giue power vnto their words to conuert his children amp to confound and astonish the hearts of his enemy if he send them he will defend and protect them so that one haire of their heads shall not fall to the earth without his prouidence if he send them he will prouide for them and sufficiently reward them and wil honour them in the hearts of his owne people and magnifie them in the faces of their enemy and lastly if he send them he will pay them their wage euen an eternall might of comfort here and of glorie in heauen and as they are here bid goe so once they shal be bid come and that not onely with the generall call of all the elect come ye blessed of my father inherite the kingdom prepared for you but euen with that particular call with especiall blessings to them that are faithfull in this seruice come thou good and faithfull servant enter into thy maisters ioy blessed be he that commeth in name of the lord w p they that turne many to righteousnesse shall shine as the starres for euer and euer w c

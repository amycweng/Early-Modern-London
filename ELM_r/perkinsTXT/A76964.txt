the authenticall bookes of the old testament by this title apocripha q how may this appeare that these apocryphall bookes are not to be accounted canonicall scripture a by these arguments all the canonicall books of the old testament were written by prophets in the hebrew tongue but these apocryphall bookes were not penned by prophets neither were they written originally in the hebrew tongue all the canonicall bookes of the old testament were committed to the jewes and they weare faithfull registers of them but the jewes never received these apocryphall bookes as canonicall never kept

canonicall scripture to be the rule of faith and the judge of all controversies tell me therefore how know you that the scriptures are of infallible truth a the scriptures are the very word of god and

of his children and assure them that the scriptures are the oracles of god john thirdly many arguments may be drawn out of canonicall scriptures whereby we may discerne these books to be no humane writings but the very word of god q what are those arguments which may induce a reasonable man to believe that the scriptures are the word of god a they are these first the puritie and divine perfection of the doctrine contained in scripture here are many sacred and heavenly mysteries concerning mens salvation which are farre above the reach of humane reason and could never have been found

penmen of scripture who neither spare their friends nor themselves but most freely and impartially set downe their owne faults and infirmities as well as others which had they been guided by humane reason they would never have done the constant testimonie of many holy martyrs and of the church of christ in all ages q you have proved the scriptures to be the word of god and therefore i doubt not but a christian may boldly build his faith upon them but whether are the scriptures a sufficient and perfect rule of faith and obedience a yes all points of necessarie faith and practise are contained in the written word and therefore the scriptures are a sufficient and perfect rule q what are we to understand by the contents of scripture a by the contents of scripture we must understand not only what is expressed in so many letters and syllables but whatsoever may thence by manifest and necessary consequence be deduced q how may it appeare that the scriptures are a sufficient and perfect rule

performe the promise wich was made to adam in paradise that the seed of the woman should bruise the serpents head gen if christ had not been made of a woman he could not have been the promised messias secondly because our redeemer was to suffer and dye for us but god could not suffer tim thirdly because it makes most for the glorie of god justice to exact satisfaction from that nature that had

curse of the law which the justice of god hath denounced and threatned against all sinners and therefore satisfaction was to be made unto god gal q how and by what meanes hath christ made satisfaction to the justice of god for us a by his voluntary obedience both active and passive christ our surety hath paid all our debts for us both the principall and the forfeiture that so we might be freely and fully discharged q what are we to understand by the active obedience of christ a the obedienee of his life performed to the whole law of god for us when christ lived upon earth he fulfilled all

philipp pet q what manner of death was that which christ suffered upon the crosse a a cursed death and a meritorious death q why do you call it a cursed death a because it was not only ignominious and shamefull before man but also accursed before god for it is written cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree deut gal q why did christ suffer this kind of death rather then any other a to declare that he was made a curse for us to the end that he might redeeme us from the curse of the law q why do you call the death that christ suffered upon the crosse a meritorious death a because it was the price of our redemption the death of an ordinary man is a duty and a debt but the death of christ was a satisfactorie oblation and a full price of redemption ephesian mat tim q what made the death of christ thus meritorious a the infinite dignitie of his person christ who willingly suffered death was not a meere man but god and man in one person and therefore it is said that god purchased his church with his own blood hence it is that the death of christ is of infinite value and merit a price sufficient for the ransome of the whole world for in that the naturall and eternall son of god suffered death it is more then if all man in the world had suffered for ever corinthian tit act q did christ suffer for us the first death only a the whole curse of the law due to our sinnes was laid

thing to those that are redeemed by him to be done or suffered in way of merit or satisfaction to the justice of god a nothing at all christ is a most absolute and perfect redeemer and saviour christ

god by that righteousnesse that is inherent in himselfe a no we are justified in god sight not by my righteousnesse inherent in us but by the righteousnesse and obedience of christ imputed unto us and therefore christ is stiled the lord our righteousnesse as our sinnes were imputed to christ so christs righteousnesse is imputed to us as the sinne for which christ suffered is inherent in us not in christ so the righteousnesse whereby we are justified is inherent in christ not in us corinthian rom jeremiah corinthian rom q but this seemes to be an absurd doctrine that a man should be made righteous by the righteousnesse of another we know a man cannot be wise with another mans wisdome a man cannot be warme with the cloathes another weareth and therefore how can we be made righteous how can we be justified in god sight by that righteousnesse which is resident in the person of christ and not in our selues a although the righteousnesse whereby we are justified be inherent in the person of christ and not in us yet it is not christs alone but as it is his so it is ours also look how the sinne and transgression of adam is made our sinne in like manner the righteousnesse of christ is ours as the sinne of adam was of force to condemne us because we were in his loynes so the righteousnesse and obedience of christ our surety is much more availeable to justify us rom q in what sense is the righteousnesse of our saviour christ ours a as this righteousnesse whereby we are justified before god is christs properly and inherently so it is ours truely and really both in regard of our right and interest to it and in regard of the use and fruit of it see gen amp q when is this righteousnesse made ours a at what time we are effectually called and spiritually united to christ and made

attributes of god are either principall and incommunicable or secondarie and communicable q what are the principall attributes of god a they are these absolute perfection infinitenesse and immutabilitie q why are these attributes stiled incommunicable a first because they are so proper to god that they are not communicable to any creature secondly because they are not only incommunicable themselves but make all the other attributes of god incomunicable also q how are we to co nceive of god perfection a god hath all excellencies in him in the highest degree and

therefore he is stiled the blessed god mark and tim i q how are we to conceive of god infinitenesse a god is infinite in essence god hath neither matter nor forme which are the propper limits of essence and therefore his essence is unlimited and infinite god is infinite in quantitie and greatnesse here immensitie and ubiquitie are attributed to god god is infinite in time and this is called his eternitie q what is god immensitie a it is a divine attribute whereby is noted that god is without all dimensions god measureth all things but cannot himselfe be measured by any thing he is higher

communicable a they are these life understanding will power holinesse justice mercie truth and fidelitie with many the like q why are these attributes stiled communicable a because we may see some

plainly in what manner doth god understand all things a god doth not understand all things successively or by discourse collecting one thing from another but he knoweth and comprehendeth all things by one simple and eternall act so that all things both past and to come are present before him q what is the will of god a it is that divine facultie whereby god most freely approveth or disapproveth whatsoever he knoweth and willeth whatsoever may make for his owne glory and this will of god is the first and highest cause of all things see psalm ephesians exod mat corinthian q doth not god

god is able to doe whatsoever he will yes whatsoever is simply possible for so perfect an essence as for those things which imply and argue imperfection of nature or imperfection of grace it were dishonourable for god to doe them and therefore he cannot doe them god cannot lye god cannot denie himselfe god cannot die ampc not out of impotence or weaknesse but because these contradict the

divine properties are attributed to god essentially god is holy just and good without qualitie great without quantitie everlasting without time mercifull without passion god wisedome and power justice and mercie are himselfe god is a most pure and simple essence and therefore whatsoever is in god is god himselfe hence it is that god is stiled not only just but justice it selfe not only mercifull

as the wisedome of god is absolutely perfect infinite eternall and immutable so is his holinesse so is his justice ampc psalm seing these attributes of god are his essence and seeing they are absolutely perfect and infinite therefore it necessarily followes that all those divine properties are equall in god though they appeare not alwaies equally to us psalm q seeing the doctrine of the blessed trinitie is a deep and incomprehensible mysterie is this doctrine necessarie to be known and believed of all christians a yes we professe to believe in god the father the son and the holy

substance having the whole divine essence in it the most pure divine essence considered as it subsists with his relative and incommunicable propertie is called a person q how may this mysterie of a trinitie of persons subsisting in the unitie of the godhead be proved a not by humane reason but by divine authoritie the scripture in diverse places maketh expresse mention of three persons in the deitie as ioh there are three that beare record in heaven the father the word and the holy ghost mat goe and teach all nation baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost when christ was baptized of john in jordan the father spake from heaven and testified of his son who had then taken upon him the forme of a servant and the holy ghost appeared in the likenesse of a dove this is faithfully recorded in the foure evangelists see mat mark luke ioh by these and the like testimonies it is evident that there is a trinitie of persons in the deitie reade john corinthian gal ephesians q what are the proper names of these three persons or subsistencies a their proper names are expressed in those places of scripture that have been cited the first person is called the father the second person is called the son and the word the third person is called the holy ghost or spirit q why is the first person called the father a because he hath the relation and respect of a father to the second person q why is the second person called the son a because he hath the proper relation of a son to the first person q why is the son and second person called the word a first because as speech is conceived and begotten of the mind without any passion in like manner the son is begotten of god the father secondly because he is so often spoken of and promised in the scriptures and is in a manner the whole subject of the scripture thirdly because he bringeth glad tidings from the bosome of the father as man doth make known his will to man by his word so god hath made known and revealed his will to us by his son john q why is the third person called the spirit a although the father be a spirit and the son be a spirit as well as the third person yet this title spirit is peculiarly attributed to the third person because he is as it were spired or breathed both from the father and the son that is to say he proceedeth from them both q why is the title of holy peculiarly attributed to the third person a although the father and the son be equally holy with the third person yet the title of holy is peculiarly attributed to the spirit because it is his office to sanctifie the children of god and to make them holy which he doth in a speciall and peculiar manner the father and the son sanctifie immediatly by the spirit but the spirit sanctifieth from the father and from the son by himselfe immediatly and therefore he is called the holy ghost tit thess pet q what is the father a the father is the first person in the trinitie who by a divine generation

essence the essence of the father is the essence of the son and the essence of the holy ghost although we may say personally the father is one subsistence the son is another subsistence and the holy ghost another subsistence yet we cannot say essentially the father is one god the son is another god and the holy ghost another god for they are coessentiall that is they have the same essence together although the entire godhead the whole divine essence be in each person yet the three persons are most singularly one and the same god john joh john joh heb john corinthian deut mark corinthian and from this unitie of essence necessarily followes the cooperation of these three persons as they have one and the same essence so they worke one and the same thing inseparably gen john joh q how may this truth be confirmed that these three persons have one and the same divine essence a by these arguments first because the divine essence being most simple and infinite is not subject to multiplication or division the divine essence cannot be multiplied with the persons nor divided between them secondly because the same divine names are are given to each person as the a father is

are we to conceive of the distinction of these three persons a although these three persons have one and the same essence yet they differ really one from another so that one is not one cannot be the other the father is god the son is god and the holy ghost is god but the father is not the son neither is the holy ghost either father or son q tell me more particularly wherein doe these three persons differ a they differ not in degree or dignitie as they are coessentiall so they are coequall but these three persons are distinct john philipp column in order and manner of subsisting in their relative properties in manner of working q seeing these three persons differ not in dignitie why is one set before another a although these three persons be equall yet one is in order before another according to their manner of subsisting as the father before the son and both of them before the holy ghost math chap verse john verse the father is the person without beginning and therefore the first in order the son is of the father alone and therefore the second person in order the holy ghost is of the father and of the son and therefore the third person in order q seeing these three persons are distinguished by their relative properties tell me therefore what kind of properties are these a they are individuall and incommunicable q what may be observed from hence a that these three subsistencies the father son and holy ghost are not improperly called persons because they are distinguished one from another by incommunicable individuall and personall properties q what is the fathers relative and personall propertie a to be unbegotten and to beget psalm heb q what is the sonnes personall propertie a to be begotten john and john q what is the holy ghosts personall propertie a to proceed john q seeing these three persons although they worke one and the same thing yet not after the same manner tell me therefore how are we to conceive of this third difference a each person worketh according to the manner of his subsisting as cooperation flowes from the unitie of these three persons in essence so this distinct manner of working flowes from the distinct manner of their subsisting q what is the fathers manner of working a as the father is first in subsisting so he is first in working the father worketh of himself by the son and the holy ghost and therefore the originall and beginning of all things is given to the father q what is the sonnes manner of working a as the son is from the father so he worketh from the father by the holy ghost and therefore the dispensation of all things is given to the son john joh q what is the spirits manner of working a as the spirit is both from the father and the son so he worketh from them both and because he worketh from the father and the son therefore the consummation and finishing of all things is given to the holy ghost john q what workes are attributed to god the father a creation and providence we professe

serviceable and usefull one to another psalm the naturall prudence and providence which god hath given to many unreasonable creatures jeremiah job prov prov q what other argument of god wisedome may be observed from this worke of creation a the order which god observed in this worke of creation is another argument of his wisedome for the elements which are simple body were first created and then mixt body which are compounded of these elements and here god proceeded from the things that are lesse perfect to those that are more perfect untill he came to the perfectest as from plants which have a single life namely a growing life to fish and foules and beast which have a compound life and from them to man which hath besides vegetation and sence a reasonable soule whereby he liveth a

excellencie and perfection of the whole worke for the world was created so good and perfect that it could not be better not that god power is limited but the creature is limited the creature was not capable of more perfection although god hath made the world so good and perfect yet there is an infinite distance between that perfection of the creature and the perfection of the creator for the perfection of the creature even of the whole world is finite but the perfection of god is infinite finally the goodnesse and bountifullnesse of god appeareth in the large provision he hath made for the necessities of every one of his creatures psalm q why was man made last of all the creatures a first because man was the noblest of all visible creatures secondly because he would have man bountifully provided for before he brought him into the world to the end he might be stirred up to glorifie god for all those creatures which are made for his use thirdly because man was an epitome of

trinitie is brought in as it were deliberating and consulting about the making of this excellent creature gen let us make man where as other creatures were were made by a simple command man was not made without a divine consultation that man was made in the image and liknesse of god gen that man was made part after part first his bodie then his soule gen whereas in the creation of other creatures male and female were made together it was not so here but first the man was created and then the woman gen q seeing man was created in the image of god tell me wherein did this image consist

what was the subject of the image a the whole person consisting of bodie and soule see gen thes q tell me more particularly how or wherein did man resemble god his creator a in those noble faculties of understanding and will wherewith the soule of man was endowed in knowledge and wisedome in holinesse and righteousnesse which did perfect these faculties man was endued with admirable wisedome and knowledge as appeareth by his naming of the creatures when they came before him according to their severall natures and dispositions man was endowed with such holinesse and righteousnesse that he was able in all his actions to resemble the holinesse and righteousnesse of god his creator now in these excellent gifts and habits of wisedome holinesse and righteousnesse did the image of god principally consist column ephesian gen and q was the image of god stamped upon mans body also a yes some sparkes of god image were to be seen even in mans bodie considered as united to the soule and making one person with it for the body was made a most fit instrument for the soule being so composed that the soule might conveniently use it for all workes of holinesse and righteousnesse as a bright candle shines through a cleare lanterne so those excellent qualities which were in the soule of man did shine through his bodie and mans body should have been immortall if he had continued in his integritie together with his soule moreover there was such a grace and majestie in the person especially in the face of man that the other creatures could not look upon him without feare amp reverence rom q is there any thing also wherein man did resemble god his creator a yes in his dominion and rule over the creatures as god is absolute lord over all creatures so he made man his lord deputy under him and therefore the creatures were brought unto him as to their lord to see how he would name them corinthian gen psalm gen q wherein did that dominion which god gave man over the creatures consist a in a most free use of the creature for god glory for his own necessity and lawful delight gen q seeing man consisteth of a body and of a soule tell me therefore whereof was mans body made a of the dust of the earth with the rest of the elements gen and job ecclesiastes q what manner of body was it made a god formed and fashioned the body of man after a fingular manner above

necessarie for comeliness or use gen q how was the soule of man made a it was made of nothing by the insufflation or inspiration of god god immediately breathed it into the bodie it was not first created and then inspired but created and inspired together zech genes ecclesiastes q what manner of soule was it made a a reasonable soule endowed with diverse excellent faculties and of that nature that it is able to subsist and live of it selfe and to give life unto the bodie and therefore being joyned to the bodie which god had formed man became a living and reasonable creature gen q how are we to conceive of the creation of the woman a the womans body was not made immediately of the foure elements but of one of adams ribs man being cast into a deep sleep the soule of the woman was not produced from adams soule as her bodie from his bodie but created of god and inspired into the bodie which god had builded as the soule of the man was created immediately of nothing in like manner was the soule of the woman gen gen q why did god make the woman a because god saw it was not convenient and comfortable for man to live alone and amongst the rest of the creatures there was not one fit to be his companion gen q how was the woman fitted for the man a the woman was made an help meet for man in regard she was made every way like unto him namely first in kind and nature such as were the

providence a god ordinarie providence is that whereby he provideth for his creatures by ordinarie meanes now seeing this is god usuall and ordinarie manner of working both in workes of nature and in workes of grace therefore to depend upon god extraordinarie providence without using the ordinarie meanes when the lord doth afford them is to tempt god psalm hos act rom mat q what is god extraordinarie providence a god extraordinarie providence is that whereby he provideth for his creatures extraordinarily and by miracle sometimes god leaps over the second causes and workes the end without the meanes and this is called god immediate providence thus god sustained moses and elijah dayes together without meat or drink sometimes god worketh above naturall meanes and by miracle thus

extendeth to all things whatsoever not one sparrow is forgotten of god the very haires of our heads are all numbred there is not any creature either in heaven or in earth there is not any thing belonging to any creature but the providence of god extendeth unto it as the glorious angels the proper inhabitant of the highest heaven are under the hand of god government so the basest wormes that creep upon the earth are under the eye of god providence luke mat jon q doth the providence of god extend to those things which come to passe by casualtie a yes as the providence of god extendeth to

verse q but doth any thing come to passe by chance a nothing cometh to passe by meer chance indeed those events which were not foreseen or intended by us the second causes whereof we are ignorant of are called casuall and such things are said to fall out casually or by chance but no event is simply casuall that is so casuall as that the providence of god should not extend to it for divine providence hath an hand in governing those events which seem casuall to us that are ignorant of the second causes of them we must not therefore ascribe that to fortune which is to be attributed to divine providence what cometh to us by chance we must make account it is of god sending see mark chap samuel verse q may christians use these termes of chance and fortune a religion doth not

avenger the lord hateth forbiddeth condemneth and punisheth all sinne and therefore he is not the author of any sinne we may rather accuse the sun which is the fountaine of light to be the cause of darknesse then accuse god who is goodnesse it selfe to be the cause and author of sinne yes god is so farre from being the author of sinne that he would never suffer it were it not for the good that he can draw out of it deut psalm and rom james q how then doth the providence of god extend to evill and sinfull actions a god is neither the author nor actor of any sin nor yet an idle spectator of sinners but he acteth the part of a judge and of a governour the lord hath a powerfull hand in governing the transgressions of all sinners yet so as he is most free from all staine of sinne and unrighteousnesse read and consider these testimonies of scripture gen exod compared with psalm exod and and sam and chronicle king act and rom and thess q but how can the lord so powerfully and effectually governe sinners and yet be free from all staine of sinne a as a man that ringeth a crackt bell is the cause of the motion of the bell but not of the jarring of it and as a man that rides upon a lame horse when he puts him forward is the cause of the horse his going but not of his haulting so here god is the universall cause and author of every action and motion of the sinner for all actions naturally and simply considered are good but the divell and mans concupiscence and corrupt will are the proper authors of that evill or faultinesse which cleaveth to the action act q how may this be further cleared a as a skilfull workman can use an ill tool well and worke artificially with it in like manner the lord can use those wicked and foolish man which are the instruments of his providence well and wisely the instrument we know is wholly subject to the principall agent without infusing any qualitie into it that therefore which wicked man being the instruments of god providence doe wickedly and sinfully the lord doth justly and righteously for the will and purpose of sinners which are god instruments differ from the will and purpose of that righteous god which over ruleth and governeth these instruments q can you make this more plaine by an example a this may plainly be seen in the crucifying of christ as judas the jewes and pilate delivered up christ to death so god the father also is said to have done the same but judas did it out of discontentment and covetousnesse to the end he might obtain the money he desired the jewes of malice and ignorance to the end that christ should not raigne over them pilate out of ambition and feare to the end he might please the people and keep his place whereas god delivered up christ to death out of love to his church and for the salvation of his people act john act and rom mat act john john q what followeth from hence a seing that wicked man are the proper actors of their own sinnes though they be as instruments in god hand yet they are active instruments which understand and will what they doe amp seeing that which sinners doe wickedly the lord who governeth all sinners doth righteously therefore god may justly punish sinners for doing that wherein they have been the instruments of his providence isa q how doth the providence of god extend to good and evill events a god is the author of all events good and evill as all blessings so all afflictions and judgements come from the lord hand and by his speciall appointment whosoever be the instrument or messenger to convey any blessing unto us

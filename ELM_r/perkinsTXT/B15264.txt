ierusalem ierusalem which killest the prophets and st est them which are sent to thee how often would i haue gathered thy children together as the hen gathereth her chickens vnder her wings and ye would not behold your habitation shall be left vnto you desolate this whole chapter cotaines a sermon that our sauiour christ made to the iewes at ierusalem it hath two parts the first is a reproofe of the iewish doctours namely the scribes and pharisies for sundrie vices from the beginning of the chapter to the verse the second is an inuectiue against ierusalem in the words which i haue now read ierusalem ierusalem which killest the prophets ampc in the inuectiue two things are to be considered the rebellion of ierusalem in the verse and the punishment of this sinne verse touching the rebellion it selfe three things are set downe the place amp p rsons in the wordes ierusalem ierusalem the degree and practise of rebellion in these wordes which killest the prophets ampc the manner and forme of their rebellion in these words how oft wold i haue gathered you amp ye wold not according to the order of the holy ghost first i will begin with the place it is a wonder that ierusalem of all the places in the world should be charged with the height of rebellion against god for it was the citie of god and had prerogatiues aboue all cities in the world saint paul hath noted seuen of them the first is that they were israelites that is of the posteritie of iacob the second is adoption in that they were reputed and called the children of god the third is that they had the glorie of god that is the mercy seat the pledge of the presence of god the fourth is the couenants that is the two tables of the couenant the fifth is the giuing of the law namely of the iudiciall and ceremoniall lawe the sixth is the vvorship of god the publike solemnitie whereof was tied to the temple at ierusalem the seuenth that to them pertained the promises made to the patriarkes touching the messias to these the prophet micah addeth the eight priuiledge that the first church of the new testament should be gathered in ierusalem and that consequently the preaching of the gospel should passe thence to all nation now for all these blessings and mercies christ our sauiour cries out and complaines of ierusalems rebellion and this is not the first time of his complaint in the daies of the prophet isai he saith that when he had done all that he could doe for his vineyarde it brought forth nothing but wilde grapes by the prophet ezechiel he sets downe a long catalogue of his blessings to this people and withall a catalogue of their vnthankfulnes hence it appeares that where god shewes the greatest mercie there oftentimes is the greatest wickednes and vnthankfulnes and this is partly verified in this land for within the compasse of this fourtie yeares we haue receiued great blessings from god both for this life and for the life to come specially the gospel with peace and protection and the like haue not bin seene in former ages yet there was neuer more vnthankfulnes then now for now commonly man are wearie of the gospel and begin to decline from that which they haue bin and the care to please god and doe his will is accounted but a curious precisenes of many secondly hence it may be gathered that god doth not tie the infallible assistance of his spirit to any place or codition of man if euer any citie in the world had this priuiledge it was ierusalem but ierusalem which was the seat and habitation of god had not this priuiledge because it is here cha ged with rebellion against god no place therfore nor codition of me hath it it is alleadged that god hath made a promise to the order of priesthood the priests lips shall preserue knowledge and thou shalt require the law at his mouth i answer that these words are not a promise but a commandement for sometimes wordes of the future tense are put for wordes imparatiue and therefore the sense is this the priests lips shall keepe that is let them keepe knowledge againe it is alledged that we are commanded to heare the scribes and pharisies because they sit in moses chaire i answer that the chaire of moses is not a place or seat but the doctrine of moses and to this doctrine i graunt the spirit of god is annexed when it is truly taught and beleeued thirdly it is alleadged that god hath promised the spirit of truth to lead man into all truth i answer that this promise doth not directly and absolutely concerne all beleeuers or all ministers but onely the apostles to whome it was made and not to them for all times amp in all actions but onely while they were in the execution of their apostolicall ministerie which stands in the fouding of the church of the new testamet partly by publishing the gospel and partly by writing the scriptures of the new testament in a word no scripture can be brought to prooue that god hath doth or will binde his spirit to any particular place or persons here then falls to the ground three popish coceits the first though the members of the catholike church may seuerally erre yet they can not erre when they are together in a generall councell lawfully assembled the second that the pope cannot erre in his consistorie the third that personall succession is a marke of the catholike church which neuertheles may be seuered from the spirit of god as we see where our sauiour christ vseth a repetition saying o ierusalem ierusalem he doth three thinges therein first he signifies thereby that he takes it for a wonder and for a thing incredible that the iewes after so many blessings should be so exceedingly vnthankfull secondly he testifies hereby his own detestation of their vnthankfulnes thirdly by this repetition he doth awake the iewes and stirre them vp to a serious consideration and loathing of this their sinne and he doth as it were proclaime the same vnto vs and not without cause for in vnthakfulnes there be two grieuous sinnes against god false witnes bearing and iniustice false witnes bearing because the vnthankfull person denies in his heart god to be the fountaine and giuer of the good things he hath and he ascribes them to his owne wisdome goodnes strength indeauour iniustice because he yeelds not to god the duties which he owes vnto him for his blessings the second point to be considered is the degree of the iewish rebellion dauid makes three degrees hereof the first is to walke in the counsell of the vngodly the second is to stand in the way of sinners the third is to sit down in the skorners chaire and this is the very top of desperate rebellion and the sinne of ierusalem for when christ saith which killest the prophets and stonest them which are sent vnto thee he notes out three sinnes in this citie impenitencie whereby they perseuered in their wicked waies without hope of amendment sacrilegious and prophane contempt of god amp the meanes of their saluation crueltie in shedding of blood and by crueltie i meane not one or two actions of crueltie but an habit therein and the custome thereof for the wordes are thus to be read ierusalem killing the prophets and stoning them that are sent to thee where stoning and killing signifie not one acte but a continuance and multiplication of acts that is a custome in shedding of blood it may be demaded how the iewes should grow to this height of wickednes i answer thus in euery actuall sinne there be foure things distinctly to be considered the fault which is the offence of god in any action the guilt or obligation to punishment for the fault the punishment it selfe which is death a blot or spot set in the foule of him that sinneth and that by the fault or offence and this blot is nothing els but a pronesse to the sinne committed or to any other sinne in the sinne of our first parents besides the fault guilt punishment there followed a blot or deformitie in the soule which was the losse of god image and the disposition of their hearts to all manner of euills since the fall of adam he that commits an actuall offence besides the fault guilt punishment imprints in his heart a new blot and that is an increase of his naturall pronesse to sinne euen as the dropsi man the more he drink the more he may and by drink he increaseth his thirst thus the iewes by custome in sinning attaine to an height in wickednes because euery act of offence hath his blot and the multiplication of acts offensiue is the continuall increase of the blot or blemish of the soule till the light of nature be extinguished and man come to a reprobate sense this must be a warning to all man to take heede least they commit any offece against god in thought word or deede considering euery offence imprints a blot in the soule secondly it may be demanded how ierusalem growen to this height of rebellion can truly be called the holy citie or the citie of the great king i answeare two waies first there were many holy man and woman in iurie and ierusalem that truly serued god and waited for the kingdome of christ as ioseph marie zachary elizabeth anna simeon nichodemus ioseph of aramathea and many others now a church is named not of the greater but of the better part as an heape of corne is so called though there be more chaffe then corne secondly i answer that a people or church that haue forsaken god remaines still a reputed church till god forsake the as a wife comitting adulterie remaines stil a supposed wife til her husband giue her the bil of diuocemet ierusalem indeede had forsaken god but god had not forsaken ierusalem for there he preserued still the temple and his worship yes when ierusalem had condemned and crucified christ s peter inspired by the holy ghost saith still to you belong the promises and to your children and ierusalem did not vtterly cease to be a citie or church of god till they contradicted amp blasphemed the apostolicall ministery for the amp not before the apostles withdrew theselues fro the fellowship of the iewes here we see a depth of mercie in god for though the iewes for their parts had deserued a thousand thousand times to be forsaken yet god for his part did not forsake them but still pursued the with mercie and we are taught hereby not to giue any sentece of the persons of euill man for though they forsake god yet know we not whether god haue forsaken them or no in this example of ierusalems rebellion we learne many things first in it we may he hold the vilenes of mans nature and our violent pronesse to sinne for the iewes went about to abolish and quench as much as they could the doctrine of saluation yes to quench it with blood and which is more with the blood of the prophets and this shewes that man drinkes iniquitie as the fish drink in water secondly in ierusalem we may behold the desperate condition of the church of rome at this day for it followes in rebellion nay it goes beyond ierusalem if any man will indifferently consider it will appeare that by the whore of babylon is meant the preset church of rome amp this whore is said to be drunke with the blood of the saints the locusts out of the bottomlesse pit goe to the kings of the earth to stirre the vp to war against the church of god and these locusts are in all likelihoode swarmes of monkes fryers amp iesuits of the church of rome and we haue foud it by long and much experience that they of the romane church haue long thirsted for the bloode of prince and people in this land thirdly we are here taught to exercise our selues in the duties of meeknes goodnesse peace to all man the prophet isai saith that man in the kingdome of christ shall not applie their swords and speares to the hurt of any as the iewes here doe but shall turne them to instruments of husbandrie as mattocks and sithes whereby is signified that man truly regenerate shall lay aside all purpose and minde of doing any hurt and shall giue themselues to doe the good they can againe he saith that the wolfe and the lambe shall dwell togither and that there shall be no hurt in all the holy mount of god the deuill by the sinne of our first parents of man made vs beast lyons wolfes tygers beares cockatrices and christ again of beast hath made vs his lambs and sheepe in respect of meeknes and patience fourthly we are here taught not to oppose our selues against the ministers of god but without pride and fiercenes to yeeld subiection and obedience to their ministerie isai foretels that in the church of the new testament a little childe that is ministers otherwise weake and silly man shall by their doctrine rule and guide wolfes leopards lyons that is fierce and cruell man by nature my people saith the lord shall come willingly in the day of assembly and the sheepe of christ heare his voice and follow him the iewes arraigne and iudge the prophets that are sent vnto them but we must suffer them in their ministerie to arraigne and iudge vs that we be not iudged of the lord againe the iewes kill their teachers but we must permit our teachers after a sort to kill vs for their ministerie must be as it were a sacrificing knife to kill the old man in vs that we may be an acceptable offer vnto god lastly ministers of the word must learne hence not to be troubled if they be hated and persequuted of man for this befell the holy prophets of god and that in the citie of ierusalem the third point is the manner or forme of their rebellion in it i consider foure things the will of god against which the iewes rebell i would the wil of the iewes rebelling ye would not the concord of both i would ye would not the manner of god will he wills their saluation in loue i would haue gathered you as an hen gathereth her chickens in patience how oft would i before i come to hadle these points in particular i wil set downe a general preamble touching the nature of will will is a power of willing nilling choosing refusing suspending which depends on reason by power i meane an abilitie or created facultie and it is so properly in man and angels but in god onely by analogie or proportion because his will is his essence or godhead indeede secondly i say it is a power of willing ampc because to will nill choose refuse suspend that is neither to will nor to nill are the proper effects of will whereby it is knowne and discerned lastly i say it depends on reason because it is incident onely to natures reasonable as god angels man and because though it goe against good reason yet it is not without reason altogether when a man knowes amp approoues that which is good and yet doth the contrarie it is because it seemes good to him to do the contrarie and in euery act of will there are two things reason to guide and election to assent or dissent will hath his propertie and that is the libertie of the will which is a freedome from compulsion or constraint but not from all necessitie from compulsion because compulsion and will be contrarie and where compulsion takes place there will giues place and will constrained is no will neuerthelesse will and necessitie may stand together god wills many things of absolute necessitie as the eternall generation of the son the proceeding of the holy ghost the doing of iustice and such like and he wills them with most perfect libertie of will the good angels will their owne hapines and the doing of iustice and that of necessitie for they cannot will to sinne or to be in miserie and all this they will most freely nay the necessitie of not sinning is the glorie and ornament of will for he that doth good so as he cannot sinn is more at libertie in doing good then he that can doe either good or euill when the creature is in that estate that it willingly serues god amp cannot but serue god then is our perfect libertie againe the libertie of will since the fall of man is ioyned with a necessitie of sinning because it stands in bondage vnder sinne in this respect it is fitly tearmed of augustine the bondfree will wherefore we may not imagine in the will a libertie which is a freedome from all necessitie that this may the better appeare let vs consider the kinds of necessitie there is a simple or absolute necessitie when a thing cannot possibly be otherwise thus we say there is a god and he is righteous ampc this necessitie stands not with the will of the creature yet doth it stand with god wil in whom an absolute necessitie of holinesse and goodnes is ioyned with absolute freedome of will againe there is a necessitie by violence or compulsion and this abolisheth freedome and consent of will thirdly there is a necessitie of infallibilitie or of consequence when some thing followes necessarily vpon a supposed antecedent as namely vpon the determination and decree of god this necessitie and freedo of will may both stand together for to the doing of a voluntarie action it is sufficient that it proceede of iudgement amp haue his beginning from within the will though otherwise in respect of god will it be of vnchangeable necessitie the certentie of god decree doth not abolish the consent of mans will but rather order it and mildly incline or draw it forth and the thing that is directly contrarie to freedome of will is compulsion because it abolisheth consent the libertie of will stands in a double power the first is when it wills any thing of it owne selfe to be apt and able to nill the same and so on the contrarie and it is called in schooles the libertie of contradiction the second is when it wills any thing to be able to will an other thing or the contrarie as for example when god willed the creation of the world he could haue nilled the same and when he willed the creation of one world he could haue willed the creatio of mo worlds and this latter is called the libertie of contrarietie will by this libertie is distinguished fro the inclinations of natural agent which alwaies shew themselues in the same manner put matter to the fire it burnes alwaies amp it can not but burne cast vp a stone into the aire it fals down alwaies and can not but fall downe secondly will by this libertie is distinguished from the appetite of beast for it followes sense and in choosing or refusing keeps alwaies one order the sheep flies the wolfe and all sheep doe so at all times and in all places bees gather honie and they doe so alwaies and in all places and they can doe no otherwise when the beast in the field chooseth one hearb and refuseth another there is a shewe of libertie yet no true libertie for that which it choseth or refuseth once it choseth or refuseth alwaies in the same manner thus much of the generall nature of will now i come to the points in had the first is touching the wil of christ i would according to the two natures of christ so be there two wills in him the will of his godhead and the will of his manhood some thinke that these words are ment of the will of his manhood for they suppose him heere to speake as the minister of circumcision and consequently as a man this i thinke is a truth but not all the truth because the thing which he willeth namely the gathering of the iewes by the ministerie of the prophets was begun and practised long before his incarnation wherefore as i take it here his divine will is ment or the will of his godhead which is also the will of the father and the holy ghost this will is one and the same as god is one yet may it be distinguished on this manner it is either the will of his good pleasure or his signifying will the truth of this distinction wee may see in earthly princes who beare the image of god a king determines within himselfe according to his pleasure what shalbe done in his kingdom and what not this is his will againe he signifies some part of his secret pleasure to his subiects as occasion shall be offred and this is also his will euen so the pleasure of god within himselfe and e significations thereof to his creatures either in whole or in part are bis will the first is mentioned ephesian where paul saith the ephesians were predestinate according to the good pleasure of his will that it may be rightly conceiued of vs i will set downe things the first is that this will is god purpose or decree according to counsell for in it these two concurre his counsell and his decree his counsell sees all things and all the causes of them his decree determines what shall be done and what vndone and he determines according to his owne eternall counsell yet is not counsell a rule to his will for there is nothing higher then his will and his counsell also is according to his will which is goodnes it selfe and therefore by paul counsell is called the counsell of his will secondly in god will there is a soueraigntie that is an absolute power whereby he is lord of all the actions that hee willeth willing of himselfe without dependance from any without impediment or controlement what he will when he will and how he will thus much is signified in the parable may i not doe with mine owne as i will and by paul alleadging moses i will haue mercie on whome i will haue mercie teaching also that we are at god pleasure as clay at the pleasure of the potter this must teach vs when we thinke or speake of god works amp iudgements to thinke and speake in modestie and sobrietie with admiration reverence not dating to search into the reason of them or think hardlie of them when they sound not with our reason contenting our selues with this that we know god to haue a soueraigntie in his will to wil at his pleasure and his will to be good the third point is that the will of god is the beginning or first cause of all things without exception and of all their motions and actions and it is a beginning two waies first in regard of the existence or being of things secondly in regard of their goodnes that all things in particular haue their being from the wil of god as from the first efficient cause i shew it thus god is of that power that nothing ca come to passe which he nilleth or which is vtterly against his will therefore whatsoever comes to passe comes to passe because he wils it either simply or in some part a wise gouernour of a familie or of an armie hauing all things in his owne power suffers nothing to be done without his wil and he desires in the very smallest matters to haue a stroke and nothing hinders this desire but his owne weaknes which is not incident to the maiestie of god god by an vnchangeable presciece foresees all things that shall come to passe and therefore by an vnchangeable will he willeth the beeing of them for god foreknowledge dependes on his will not because god foresees things to come therefore they come to passe but because according to god will they are to come to passe therefore he foresees them indeede there is in god a knowledge of things that possibly may be though they neuer be and this knowledge goes before god decree yet the diuine knowledge of things that certenly shall be followes the will and determination of god to proceede further in that god wills the beeing of all things he makes them to be for his will is operatiue not seuered from his power but distinguished and his willing of any thing is his doing of it and therefore it pleaseth the holy ghost to signifie the will of god by an operatiue word or commandement in the beginning god said let there be this and that and it was so now this commanding word was his will againe man liues by euery word of god that is by any thing that god in his pleasure wills to be our foode things in respect of beeing must haue dependance on the will of god or on themselues or on some other thing if they depend on themselues for their beeing they are god if they depend on any other thing without and beside god that thing is god also it remaines therefore that all things and acts in the world considered as acts haue their beeing by a dependance on god as on the highest cause or the cause of causes this doctrine must be remembred for it is the foundation of true patience when we consider whatsoeuer comes to passe befalls vs according to the will of god vpon this ground iob armes himselfe to patience and dauid saith i held my tongue amp said nothing because thou lord diddest it secondly this doctrine is the meanes of all true comfort whe we consider that all our afflictions are from the good pleasure of god thus did the primitiue church comfort it selfe when it considered that the iewes herod pontius pilate amp the rest did nothing against christ but that which the counsell of god had determined before to be done and it must be out comfort that we are predestinate to be made conformable to the image of christ in afflictions furthermore the will of god is the beginning of the goodnes of things for a thing is not first good and then willed by god but it is first willed by god and thus it becomes good this is a manifest truth i will not stand vpo it it may here be demanded whence the euill in the creature namely sinne hath his beginning i answer it comes of the will of the declining creature and not from the will of god yet is it not without the will of god for though he wil not sinne properly because he hates it yet doth he will the being of it in the world for in respect of the counsell of god it is good that euill should be and god wills the being of sinne non positiu not because it is his will to effect produce or giue a being to it but because negatiu deserendo his will is to forsake his creature and not to hinder the being of euill when he may and perillatione thus euill not hindred comes to passe and whereas god foresaw it in his eternall counsell and yet willed not to hinder it when he might in effect he willed the beeing of it in the worlde though simply he wills it not the last point is that this will of god good pleasure being hidde from vs is not the rule of our actions and of our faith moses saith secret things belong to the lord our god and things reuealed to vs and to our children hence it followes that we doe and may with a submission in our wills dissent from this will of god before it is knowne to vs without sinne paul would by vertue of his apostolicall commission haue preached in asia and bythinia and god would not because it is said the spirit withstood him yet did not paul sinne herein one good thing may differ from another and that which the creature sometime willeth without offence god willeth otherwise by his most righteous pleasure samuel prayes for saul otherwise then the secret pleasure of god was but when the decree of god was reuealed to him he then stayed his praying here sundry man are to be reprooued that reason thus if it be the wil of god that i shal be saued it shall so be howsoeuer i liue therefore i will liue as i list they make the secret will of god the rule of their liues which should not be because the reuealed will of god is the law or the onely rule of things to be done and beleeued thus we see what the will of god pleasure is now this wil is not ment in this text how oft would i for the pleasure of god canot be withstood or resisted isay my counsell shall stand and i will do all my pleasure but the wil here mentioned may be resisted and withstood i would ye would not the signifying will of god is when he reuealeth some part and portion of his pleasure so farre forth as it serues for the good of his creature and for the manifestation of his iustice or mercie this signifying will is not indeede the will of god properly as the will of his good pleasure is for it is the effect therof yet may it truly be so tearmed for as the effects of anger without the passion are called anger in god so the signe and signification of his will may be tearmed will this will is propounded sometimes more plainly sometimes more darkly it is propounded more plainely three waies by his word by his permission by his operation his word is his will for so paul saith prooue what is the good wil of god and it is not his decree or pleasure but his signifying will because it serues to declare and manifest what is pleasing and acceptable to god what is our dutie and what he requires of vs if we desire to come to life eternall for this cause both the law and the gospel and all the commandements prohibitions promises and threatnings thereof are the signifying will of god for commandements signifie what we are to doe prohibitions what we are to leaue vndone promises what good he will doe vnto vs threatnings what punishments are due to sinne furthermore by reaso of the word the ministerie and dispensation thereof is the signifying will of god for by it god signifies his pleasure touching the saluation of man diuine permission is likewise the signifying will of god for by it he signifies that he will not hinder the beeing of the thing permitted and consequently that the thing permitted shall come to passe thirdly euery operation or worke of god signifies what god will haue done and what must come to passe for when a thing is done we know thereby what is and was the pleasure of god considering nothing comes to passe without his will when the signifying will is more darkly propounded it is because some things appertaining to the said will are concealed and by reason of this concealement sometime there seemes to be a contrarietie betweene the signifying will and the will of his good pleasure but indeede there is none and the end why god doth so darkly signifie and propound his pleasure is not to hurt or deceiue but to procure the good of his creature examples of this kind there be in scripture three sorts first of all god sometimes propounds a commaundement to man and conceales the end of the commandement for the endes of diuine precepts are three one is obedience when god wil haue the thing commanded to be don precisely as it is commanded the other is triall when he wills not the thing commanded to be done absolutely but onely wills to make triall of the loialtie of his creature the third is conuiction when by commanding god intends to conuince his creature of disobedience thus parents sometime giue precepts to their children that must be done and sometime againe they giue a commandement the doing whereof they intend not but onely intend thereby to make experience of the affection and dutie of their children and sometime one man commands an other onely in way of conuiction as when the creditour saith to the bankrupt pay thy debt which he neuer lookes for and which peraduenture he minds to forgiue diuine precepts therefore be of three sorts precepts of obedience as the commandement of the moral law precepts of triall and precepts of conuiction now when the signifying wil of god is propounded in a precept amp the ende of the precept is concealed the pleasure of god is darkly signified god giues a commaundement to abraham offer thine onely son isaac the end was only to trie abraham amp this end was concealed til abraha was in doing the fact for then the angel of the lord staied him amp said now i see abraham feares god and the very commaudement offer isaac seemes to be flat contrarie to the will of god pleasure or decree for as it appeares by the euent isaac was not to be slaine and therefore the not slaying of isaac was decreed of god now then it may be said why should god command any thing contrarie to his decree i answer there is an apparent cotrariety by reason the end of the commandement was concealed but indeede there is none for as it was the decree of god that isaac should not be offered so also was it his decree that abraham should be tried in the offer of isaac and with this decree doth this commandement accord for it is a commandement not so much of absolute obedience as of triall and therefore it is a fit and conuenient meanes to accomplish the decree of god the lord by the hand of moses giues a commadement to pharao let the people goe and yet the secret pleasure amp purpose of god was that he should not let them goe here is contrarietie in shew but indeed none for it was also the decree of god to conuince pharao of rebellion and hardnes of heart and to this end serues this commandement because properly according to god intention it was a commandement of couiction though pharao for his part was to accept of it as of a commandement to be obeied and accomplished by this doctrine the publike ministerie of the word receiues a iust defence some are of opinio it is a meanes to delude the world because in it a commandement is giuen to all without exception to repent and beleeue and yet grace to repent and beleeue is not but they are deceiued for the commandement repent and beleeue though in the intent of the minister it haue onely one end namely the saluation of all yet in the intention and counsell of god it hath diverse ends in them which be ordained to life eternall it is a precept of obedience because god will inable them to do that which he commandeth in the rest it is a commandement of triall or conviction that to vnbeleeuers their sinne might be discouered and all excuse cut off thus when the precept is giuen to beleeue and not the grace of faith god doth not delude but reprooue and convince man of vnbeleefe and that in his iustice the second example of the signifying will of god darkly propounded is when god propoundes his promises concealing the exception or condition thereof gen ye shall rule ouer the fowles of the aire the fish of the sea amp the beast of the earth and of hierusalem the lord saith psalm this is my rest for euermore these promises take no place now and yet there is no contrarietie in god will because the said promises must be vnderstood with their exception vnlesse ye fall from me and prouoke mine anger by your sinnes the third example is when god propoundes his threats concealing the conditions and exceptions thereof iud i will saith the lord deliuer you no more and it was his pleasure afterward to deliuer them againe and againe exod let me alone that my wrath may waxe hote for i vvill consume them and he spared them at the praier of moses ion yet fortie daies and niniuie shall be destroyed for all this niniuie was spared and not destroyed we may not here so much as dreame of any chaunge or vntruth in god for all threatnings denounced must be vnderstood with this clause except ye repent and turne vnto me and this exception god conceales that he may the better terrifie the consciences of man and so prepare them to true repentance isay the lord saith by the prophet to ezechias s t thine house in order for thou shalt die and not liue and yet he liued fifteene yeares after here god conceals his owne pleasure of lengthning the daies of ezechias and signifies what shall betide him in respect of nature amp the helps thereof in all these examples we may not surmise any fraud or double dealing in god for he doth not speak one thing and minde another after the fashion of hypocrites but he conceals part of his will and reueals part and this he doth not for the hurt of any after the manner of deceiuers but for the good of man thus much of the signifying will of god now i come to the text in hand the words i would haue gathered you are not to be vnderstood of the decree of god but of this signifying will and namely of the ministerie of the word for when god sent his word to hierusalem by his prophets he therby signified that it was his pleasure and will to gather and conuert them and he is said to wil the conversion of the iewes in and by his word two wayes first because he approoued it as a good thing in it selfe being agreeable to his goodnes and mercie secondly because he commaunded and required it of them as a dutie of theirs and as a thing necessarie to saluation some may happily say it is a point of hard dealing for god to commaund the iewes to doe that which they can not doe and to complaine because they are not gathered and that a maister might aswell commaund his servant to carrie a mountaine on his back and complaine because it is not done i aunswer thus if a maister could giue to his servant power and abilitie to carrie a mountaine he might then commaund him to do it and if he should by his owne default loose this abilitie the said maister might still commaund him and complaine if he did not the thing commaunded and this is the case with god for he gaue all man grace in our first parents to obey any of his commaundements this grace in them we haue cast away amp do not of our selues so much as desire it of god and god for his part is not bound to giue vs this grace againe he therefore may iustly commad vs to turne vnto him though we now be vnable to turne if we compare this text with isa they may seeme to be contrarie for here christ saith i would haue gathered you there he saith harden them that they be not gathered and conuerted god therefore seemes to will and not to will one and the same thing answer there is but one will in god yet doth it not equally wil all things but in diverse respects it doth will and nill the same thing he wills the conuersion of hierusalem in that he approoues it as a good thing in it selfe in that he commands it and exhorts man to it in that he giues them all outward meanes of their conuersion he wills it not in that he did not decree effectually to worke their conuersion for god doth approoue and he may require many things which neuerthelesse for iust causes knowne to himselfe he will not doe the confirmation of the angels that fell god approoued as a thing good in it selfe yet did not he will to confirme them a iudge in compassion approoues and wills the life of a malefactour and yet withall he wills the exequution of iustice in his death euen so god sometime wills that in his signifying will which he wills not in the will of his good pleasure by this which hath bin said we learn that where god erects the ministerie of his word he signifies thereby that his pleasure is to gather man to saluation in this regard the prophet isay saith that the preaching of the gospel is a banner displayed that all nation may come vnto it all this is verified in this our english nation for more then fortie yeares hath god displayed this banner vnto vs and more then fortie years hath he signified in the ministerie of his word that his will is to giue mercie amp saluation vnto vs first therefore we owe vnto god all thankfulnes amp praise for this endles mercie secondly we are to reuerence the ministerie of the word in as much as god signifies his good will vnto vs therby amp we are in all obedience to subiect our selues to it and for this cause we must suffer our selues to be conuerted and gathered by it subiects vse to reuerence the letter of their prince how much more then must we reuerence the letter of the liuing god sent vnto vs that is the ministerie of the word amp coform our selues to it thirdly hece we may learn to forsee our miserable condition in this lad for though god for his part haue long signified his will vnto vs touching our euerlasting good yet there is nothing to be found in the most of vs but a neglect or contempt of the gospell and in most places man are wearie of it as the israelites were of mana what weary of the goodnes of god that offers and proclaimes mercie vnto vs yes verely and the more wearie we are of this the more wearie are we of our owne happines and consequently hasten to our owne perdition secondly it is to be obserued that the rebellion of ierusalem is against the signifying will of christ whe he saith i would ye would not and hence it followes that the signifying will of god is the rule of our obedience and not the vnreuealed wil and threfore so oft as god signifies vnto vs his will and pleasure we must yeeld our selues in obedience to it now god signifies his will three waies as i haue said by his commaundements and prohibitions by his permission and by his operatio therefore when be commaunds we must obey when he forbids we must also obey when he permits any evil we must be content lastly when god doth any thing amp brings it to passe he signifies his pleasure and we must obey we are bidden to say thy will be done and this is not onely the will reuealed in his word but also his will reuealed by any euent for when any thing comes to passe it comes to passe because it was the wil of god furthermore this signifying will must be the stay and ground of our patience and comfort for when a thing is come to passe the will of god is past vpon it amp he hath signified his pleasure as for example when a man is slaine the will of god is past vpon his life and he hath reuealed his pleasure touching his death vpon this consideration in all euents are we to stay our mindes thirdly it appeares hence what minde must be in the ministers amp teachers of the word they must put away all blinde respects of profit and praise and simply with honest hearts applie themselues and their ministerie to this end that they may gather a people to god for that which is the mind of the master in any busines the same must also be the minde of the servant the minde of the master is here set downe how oft would i haue gathered you thus much of the will of god now let vs come to the second point to cosider what is the will of man that this may appeare two things must be hadled the nature of mans will amp the strength therof of the nature of will i spake somthing before generally there is yet somewhat more to be added the nature of mans will may be gathered by the practise thereof the practise of will stands in fiue things the first is the action of the minde nam ly a cosideration of the thing to be done and the ende thereof the second is deliberation of the diverse meanes whereby the foresaide thing may be done the third is after deliberation a determination what shall be done the fourth action is proper to the will and that is election whereby the will vpon determination of the minde chooseth or refuseth that is willeth what shall be done what not the fifth is that the will in all her elections keepes and maintaines her libertie because when it wills or nills any thing it mooues it selfe freely of it selfe to will or to nill without any externall compulsion amp when it wils any thing it so wills as stil retaining a natural aptnes to nill the same and when it wills any one particular thing it remaines still apt not to will it but to will an other thing or the contrarie againe the will of man must be distinguished from the power of man whereby he doth any thing will and power in god are onely distinguished in our conceiuing beeing indeede one and the same thing namely the essence of god and therefore what god can will he can doe what he willeth he doth and his willing of any thing is his doing of it it is not so in man who can will that which he can not doe as paul saith to will is present with me but i can not doe that which i vvould will therefore is one thing and power to doe the thing willed an other the second thing to be handled is the strength of will that is what will can doe what not and how farre it extends it selfe that this may appeare will must be considered according to the foure estates of man the estate of innocencie before the fall the estate of corruption after the fall the estate of regeneration after conuersion and the estate of glorie after this life in the estate of innocencie the will of man is a power of willing either good or euill for god gaue adam a commaundement in which he forbad him to eate of the tree of knowledge of good amp euill adam therefore could either keep or break this commaundement this reason holds not in vs since the fall yet doth it hold in adam because with the commaundement he receiued the power to obey and that he could not obey it appeared by the euent because he did not obey ecclesiastes saith god made man righteous there is the power to will that which is good amp they found out many inuentions there is also a power to will that which is euill moses saith to the israelites i set before you this day life and death blessing and cursing therefore choose life that thou and thy seed may liue these words are a sentence of the law telling what we ought to do and not what we can now do but what we could do by the gift of creation before the fall here a differece of powers must be made the power to will that which is good was a gift put into adams heart by god and the power to will that which is euill was in him before his fall not a gift but onely a possibilitie to will euill if he should cease to do his dutie and thus had he power to will both good and euill in adams will there were two things libertie and mutabilitie libertie was twofould the first is a libertie simply to wil or to nill or to suspend and this is libertie of nature because it is founded in the nature of will from which it can not possiblie be seuered and therefore it still remaines in the damned spirits because where this libertie is wanting there is no will the second libertie is a libertie of grace which is a power to will or nill well or to will that which is good and to nill that which is euill this libertie is founded not in the nature but in the goodnes of the will by goodnes i meane the holines of the will which is the image of god and here we must take heed of the opinion of some who think that adam was created and placed in such a condition in which he was neither righteous not vnrighteous but in a meane betweene both but this is directly contrarie to the apostle who saith that ma was created in righteousnes amp holines and by this meanes in the first instant of adams creation he wanted libertie of grace againe by reason of this second libertie adam had a further libertie from sinne and a libertie from miserie the changeablenes of adams will appears in this that though it was created in goodnes yet was it made changeably good for such was the goodnes and inclination of his will to obey god as might be altered and changed by force of temptation the cause of this mutabilitie must be considered amp it is this that a creature righteous by creation may remaine eternal and constantly righteous two fauours or helps of god are required the posse vell perseuerare aug de correp amp gr c first is a power to perseuere in goodnesse without this power the creature of it self ceaseth to be good the actus pers uerandi secod is an act or deed and that is the will to perseuere or perseuerance it selfe this also is required with the former for god giues not onely the power but also the will and the deed and the creature doth not the good which it can do vnlesse god cause it to do the said good as he caused it to be able to doe good both these helps the good angels haue and therefore they stand and as for adam he receiued of god the first helpe and not the second for beside the goodnes of his will he receiued of god a power constantly to perseuere in goodnes if he would yet the acte of perseuerance was left to the choise and libertie of his owne will we may behold the like in nature god creates the eye and puts into it the facultie of seeing and withall he addes to the eye necessarie helpe by the light of the sun as for the act of seeing it is left to mans libertie for he may see if he will and againe if he will he may shut his eyes the physitian by article procures an appetite this done in the next place he prouides couenient food yet the act of eating is in the pleasure of the patiet for he may eat if he wil amp if he will not he may abstaine and thus god gaue ada the power to perseuere in righteousnes but the will he left to himselfe it may be saide if adam receiued power to doe good if he would and not the will to will that he could he then receiued not sufficient grace i answer he receiued sufficient for the perfection of his nature for the full obedience of the wil of god and for the attainment of euerlasting happines if he would not be wanting to himselfe but he receiued not sufficient grace for the causing of the immutabilitie of his nature neither was it of necessitie to be giuen to a creature a goldsmith intends to make a iewell of greatest value amp price he compounds it of gold pearle amp pretious stones whe he hath brought it to perfection he doth not put this condition to it that if it fall it shall not be bruised or broken and god created adam in all perfection and gaue him a power and abilitie to continue in the said perfection if he would yet did not he put vnto his nature this condition that it should be vnchangeable and vnalterable when it should be assailed by the force of outward temptation the vse of the former doctrine in adams example we see the weaknes of the excellentest creature in it selfe without the grace of god for adam hauing power to perseuere could not for all this acte or put in exequution the saide power without the further helpe of god he could fall of himselfe he could not stand or rise againe he could not auoide the least euill but as he was helped by god we therefore beeing sinnefull wretches much more are to acknowledge our infirmitie and to ascribe all we doe or can doe that is good to the grace of god thus haue the godly alwaies done the iewes in their repentance say conuert thou me and i will conuert the spouse of christ saith draw vs and we will runne after thee dauid saith incline my heart to thy commandements turne mine eyes from the beholding of vanitie and quicken me in thy precepts augustine said giue that which thou commandest and command what thou wilt we are to god as the sicke man to his keeper who saith take me vp and i will rise hold me and i will stand in regard of this our frailtie it is the best for vs to denie our selues and by faith to depende on the prouidence and mercie of god againe such as beleeue in christ haue great cause to be thakfull to god for they haue the beginnings of further grace then euer adam receiued he receiued onely the power to perseuere in his happie estate if he himselfe would but they that beleeue beside the power of perseuerance receiue the wil and the deed paul saith work your saluation with feare and trembling and then he adds it is god that works in vs the will and the deed whereby we run the race to eternall life in the estate of corruption two things are to be considered of mans will the first what it can do and how neere it comes to the doing of a good work the second what it can not do for the declaration of the first two things must br considered in corrupt will a libertie and a possibilitie the libertie is a certen freedome to will or nill or to suspend for this libertie is remaining since the fal of adam and is naturall to the will from which it can not possibly be seuered this libertie is large and sheweth it selfe in three kind of actions naturall humane ecclesiasticall naturall actions are such as are common to man and beast as to eate drink sleep smel heare taste mooue common experience declares a freedome of will in all these actions humane actions are such as are common to all man and i may fitly reduce them to three heads the first is the studie and practise of arts trade occupations and professions of all kindes and that man hath freedome of will in all these experience testifieth the second is the gouernment of societies namely of families and comon welths the lord said to cain of abel his appetite shall be subiect to thee that is in freedome of thy will thou shalt rule ouer him and his will shall be subiect to thine peter said to ananias that the giuing or the not giuing of his lands was before he gaue them in his owne libertie and paul saith that the father hath the power of his owne will to giue or not to giue his child in mariage as he shall see occasion the third is the practise of ciuill vertue iustice temperance liberalitie chastitie to this purpose paul saith that the gentiles do the thing contained in the law and that by nature for outwardly to be chast iust bountifull and so forth is in the power of naturall and corrupt will it may be said that these things are the gift of the holy ghost i answere thus the gifts of the holy ghost are two fold gifts of restraint and gifts of renouation gifts of restraint are such as serue onely to keep in the corruption of nature and not to mortifie or abolish it and they are common to all man both good amp bad and serue onely to maintaine outward peace and comely order in the societies of man of this kinde are ciuil vertues gifts of renovation are such graces of the holy ghost as serue not onely to restraine the corruption of the inward man but also to mortifie it in the root and to make a change of our sinfull nature now vertues of this kinde are onely incident to such as are in christ the third kind of actions are ecclesiasticall namely such as pertaine to the outward duties of the worship of god and there is also a libertie of will in them for corrupt and sinnefull man hath power and libertie to thinke of god and to thinke many things of him good in themselues power to read and search the scriptures power to speake and talke of the word of god power to come to the congregation and heare a sermon as the athenians did power to conceiue a zeale i say not a good zeale but onely a zeale i say for the maintenance of outward duties of religion paul saith that the obstinate iewes had a zeale of god and were followers of the iustice of the law and that himselfe beeing a pharisie vnconuerted was vnreprooueable in respect of the law of god thus farre can man proceede by the freedome of corrupt will and the deuill by naturall strength goes somewhat further for he is saide to beleeue and he conceiues his faith not by illumination of the spirit of god as man doth but by the remainders of the light of nature and by the power which yet remaines in his corrupted will for we may not supppose that since his fall he is inlightned by the spirit of god in any thing thus we see what is the libertie of corrupt will we must yet further conceiue it to be full of weaknes and imbecillitie which i will expresse in three rules the first that which the will can wil it can not do vnlesse god wil herupon s iames bids vs say we will do this or that if god will and paul wishing that he might haue a prosperous iourney to rome adds this clause by the will of god herode pontius pilate and the iewes did nothing against christ but that which the counsell of god had determined before to be done the second that which the vvill can will it cannot do without the helpe of god for in him we liue mooue and haue our beeing this helpe is twofold preseruation of the will both for power and acte and the direction thereof whereby it is ordered and applied to the things it willeth the third often the will neither willeth nor doth the things it can will and doe because it is hindred it is hindered sometimes by the minde that misleades the will sometimes again by the worke of satan thus paul saith that satan hindred him from comming to thessalonica the vse of this doctrine is twofold first the libertie of the will is the condemnation of the world for in ciuill and ecclesiasticall actions man doe not that which they can doe so farre be the most from doing that which the gospel requires that they doe not that which nature can doe some plead that if they be ordained to saluation they shall certenly be saued otherwise not and therefore they say they will leaue all to god and liue as they list but this shall be their condemnation that they haue not liued according to ciuill vertue as they might they come not to the church they search not the scriptures they heare not sermons in a word they vse not the good meanes of saluation so farre as they are able to vse them by the strength of nature secondly the weaknesse of will in his libertie must teach vs to abate our pride and to humble our selues because we can not doe any thing no not so much as mooue hand foote or finger without the helpe of god ieroboa whe he had stretched out his hand to lay hold on the prophet could not so much as pull it in againe and this consideration must likewise mooue vs to be thankfull to god because the actions we doe we doe by him the second thing to be considered in the corrupt will is possibilitas non activa so passiva vel potentia materiae a possibilitie of willing that which is good this possibilitie is a certaine condition of the wil whereby it can wil that which is good after that god hath preuented vs with his grace a stone is not of this nature neither is the beast because they are creatures vnreasonable wanting both will and vnderstanding and therfore no way capable of grace whereas man in that he hath will and vnderstanding hath a possibilitie of doing that which he cannot doe the fathers in this sense say to be able to haue faith is nature to haue faith indeede is grace hitherto i haue shewed what will can doe in the corrupt estate of man now let vs see what it cannot doe and because here the maine differences come to be considered betweene vs and the church of rome i will first lay downe a sure ground and then build vpon it the ground is this though libertie of nature remaine yet libertie of grace that is libertie to will vvell is lost extinguished abolished by the fall of adam i prooue it thus libertie of grace is founded in the goodnes or integritie of the will now this goodnes of the will is abolished by the fall of adam and therefore the libertie it selfe that is sounded thereon that the goodnes or integritie of the will is lost i confirme it thus that which we put on in our conuersion we want by nature we put on this goodnes in our conuersion for in it we put on the new man created according to the image of god in iustice and holines as paul saith againe if all the motions and inclinations of the heart be euill and onely euill and continually euill there is no goodnes in the heart but the first is true for the lord saith that he saw the frame of the thoughts of the heart to be onely euill continually paul makes three parts of man in the estate of innocencie the bodie the soule and the spirit that is the image of god wrought by the spirit beeing the ornament and glorie of both the former now since the fall the spirit is turned to flesh for what soeuer is borne of flesh is flesh saith christ that is wholly flesh and onely flesh and the naturall disposition of the flesh is to lust against the spirit what goodnes then can be in the will he that must enter into the kingdom of heauen must first be borne againe now looke as it is in the first birth so is it in the second in the first an imperfect man is not made a perfect man but that which is no man is made a man euen so in the second birth he that is a sinner amp hath nothing in him to please god is made iust and righteous for regeneration is not in respect of the substance of bodie or soule nor in respect of the faculties of the soule but onely in respect of the goodnesse thereof which is a conformitie to the will of god and if there be any part or portion thereof yet remaining there cannot be a new birth but onely a repairing of that which is decaied with a confirmation and increase of it the second reason there is vnderstand that which is called in schools potentia activa or potentia formae which we say is lost the papists say no intelligi non potest o omodo ad opera pietatis activ voluntas humana concurrat si non habeat ex se potentiam activam saltem remotam rursus habet potentiam remotam amp vires imperfectas bellarm de grat amp lib arbit l c no power or aptnes in the will corrupted to will that which is truly good therfore libertie of grace to wil well is lost the minor i prooue thus ezech a new heart also will i giue you and a new spirit will i put within you and i will take away the stonie heart out of your bodie and i will giue you an heart of flesh here two things are set down distinctly the first that the new amp fleshie heart is the gift of god that is an heart readie and apt to giue obedience the second that there is in vs no aptnes or abilitie to receiue this gift of god because our hearts are stonie god therefore giues the fleshie heart and the aptnes to receiue this gift by taking away the stonie heart christ saith that none can come vnto him vnlesse the father draw him now if there were in vs by nature the least power or aptnes to come to christ then drawing were needlesse for that argues obstinate rebellion and it were sufficient to succour helpe and confirme the foresaid power without any more adoe saint paul saith that the wisdome of the flesh that is the best inclinations and motions of the minde of a natural ma are not only enemy but euen enmitie to god now in enmitie there is nothing but hatred and contempt of god and in the hatred of god what inclination or aptnes can there be to loue and obey him againe paul saith the naturall man is not capable of the things of god for they are foolishnes to him neither can be know them for they are spiritually discerned in the minde of a naturall man there be two things to be considered the act and the power of knowing amp approouing that which is truly good and here paul giues his sentence of both of the act that the minde cannot know the things of god of the power that the minde hath no capablenes or aptnes to acknowledge or approoue them as a little vessel hath no aptnes to receiue a great quantitie of liquour againe we are not apt or sufficient of our selues to thinke a good thought as of our selues but our sufficiencie is of god therefore nature corrupted wants abilitie so much as to thinke a good thought much lesse to will that which is good againe paul tells the ephesians that they vvere dead in sinnes and trespasses and this death or deadnesse is not onely in respect of the performance of that which is good but also in regard of power to performe it for if the least power to do good remaine since the fal man is not dead as yet but dying or drawing on because as yet some portion of spirituall life remaines and if this be so how are we quickned together with christ and how is it a wonder that the dead heare the voyce of christ againe paul saith to the ephesians that they were once darknes but now are light in the lord now in darknes there is no aptnes at all either to giue or to receiue light but how were they made light without any work or cooperation of theirs euen as in the creation light was taken not from some other precedent beginnings of light but out of darknes which conferred nothing at all to the beeing of light the third reason there is not onely an impotencie to good but such a forcible pronesse and disposition to euill as that we can do nothing but sinne ieremie saith that the heart of man is wicked aboue all things who can know it paul saith that the romanes were once servant of sinne amp free in respect of righteousnes and of himself that the law was spirituall he carnall amp sold vnder sinne and of vnrepentant sinners he saith that they are in the snare of the deuill according to his will and this disposition of which i speak is not to some few sinnes but to al sinns without exception because as euery man takes of adam the whole nature of man euen so he takes the whole corruption of mans nature and where this huge amp horrible masse of corruptio takes place there all inclination and power to goodnes must needes giue place it may be obiected that if the wil be in bondage vnder sin it hath lost his libertie quite i answer not so for both may stand together the prisoner though he haue lost a great part of his libertie yet hath he not lost al for within the prison he may as he will either sitt stand lie or walk and though he which is captiue to sin can do nothing but sinne yet may he in sinning vse his libertie and in the diverse kinds of euils intended shew the freedome of his will the fourth reason all the goodnes we haue and all we can do that is pleasing to god is wholly in scripture ascribed to god he that is the child of god is born of god not of blood that is not of naturall generatio not of the will of the flesh that is not of the power and inclination of naturall will not of the will of man that is the heroicall inclination of excellent man we are the workmaship of god created in christ to good works now the creature confers nothing to his creation which is wholly from the creator because to create is not to make something of something but something of nothing christ saith without me ye can do nothing and the reason is there rendred because christ is the vine and they which beleeue are vine braches which branches that they may bring forth good fruit must first be set into christ and then draw their sap that is power to do good from him patrons of nature against the grace of god alleadge foure speciall reasons for liberty of wil in moral acts that is in things and actions good according to the morall law the first is this god hath giuen sundry commandements to man since his fall some pertaining to the law some to the gospel as commadements to turne vnto god to beleeue to repent and all commandements are giuen in vain vnlesse there be freedome of will to do them or not to doe them i answer first these commandements set not downe what we can do but what we should do they signifie not our abilitie but our office and dutie whereby we should please god amp come to saluation and if the commandements be impossible it is not god fault but ours for they are not impossible to created but to corrupted nature secondly though we can not wil to do that which god commands yet are not his commandements idle for they are the instruments and meanes of the spirit of god whereby he effects in vs the good he commands the second obiection we are boud to giue vnto god an account of all our doings in the day of iudgement and this were not equall vnlesse we had power to will both good and euill i aunswer it sufficeth to binde vs to a reckning that once we had libertie in adam to will either good or evil and all man since the fal haue some measure of libertie of will the wicked libertie in sinne the righteous libertie in duties of righteousnes the third obiection from testimonies of scripture it is alleadged that the samaritane which lay wounded betweene ierico amp ierusale is a figure of makind halfe dead in sinn i answer that in parables nothing may be gathered that is beside the scope thereof and the scope of this parable is nothing els but to shew who is our neighbour againe we graunt that libertie of wil is not abolished but wounded because though libertie of grace to will wel be lost yet libertie of nature to wil stil remaines againe the words of christ to the angell of laodicea are obiected behold i stand at the dore and knock if any man open i will come in here say some to knock is the work of grace and to open the work of free will i answer that the words if any man open are conditionall and therefore determine nothing of the power of will either to or fro againe the words set not downe what the angell is able to do but what his office is and what he can doe by grace furthermore the place of deuteronomie is obiected the word which i commaund thee is neere thee that thou mayst do it but in these words moses sets downe what the israelites can do by the grace of a mediatour who fulfilling the law for vs and giuing grace to obey the same makes the commandements of the law which otherwise are impossible to be easie thus paul hath expounded this text rom where he signifies that sentences of the law must not legally but euangelically be vnderstood of them that are in christ and fulfil the law by him the fourth obiection when man is conuerted he is not conuerted against his wil for then god should deale with a man after the manner of a stone or a beast therefore he which is conuerted is conuerted with the consent of his owne will answer this consent is not of our selues but of god for as the conuersion is of god so is the wil to be conuerted of this point more afterward vpon the ground formerly deliuered sundry questions of great moment are resolued the first is whether a naturall man or an infidel can by the freedome of his will without faith and without the helpe of god doe any worke morally good that is a worke in which there is no sinne they of the church alex para summa q thom in q bon in sent d bellar de gra amp lib arb l c of rome for many hundred yeares haue answered yes for they confidently teach that a man pressed with no temptation may without faith by the speciall helpe of god and without it by his owne strength so doe that which is morally good that no sinne at all be committed therein we answer no and that vpon sufficient warrant for such as the beginning of an action is such is the action it selfe now the minde and will of man are the beginnings of all their actions and in them there is no abilitie to thinke or to will that which is truly good but a continuall disposition to the contrarie all actions therefore proceeding thece are onely and continually euill vpon this ground paul saith that to the vncleane the vse of all things is vnclean and christ saith that an euill tree can not bring forth good fruit and whatsoeuer is not of faith without exception is sinne to this doctrine alwaies subscribed the orthodoxe and ancient church the arausican councell saith it is from the gift of god that we keepe our feete from iniustice and that nulla bona facit homo man doth no good things which god inables him not to do cyprian saith al vve can doe is god hierome saith without christ euery vertue is but as a vice gregorie if faith be not first wrought in our heart other things can not be good though they seeme to be so augustine saith expressely that all the workes of vnbeleeuers are sinnes because whatsoeuer is not of faith is sinn and he saith thus of pelagius the heretike sometimes he poised the power of the will with such equall waights in euen ballance that he might determine how it auailed somwhat to cause vs not to sin which if it be so there is no place reserued for the helpe of grace without which we say free will hath no force at all in causing vs not to sinne in this speach there are two things worthie obseruation one that in augustines iudgement freewill of it selfe hath no force at all to cause man not to sinne of the same minde is the master of the sentences who saith that man before he be repaired by grace can not but sinne though the schoole afterward for the most part dissent from him the second that it was the heresie of pelagius to teach that freewil somewhat availeth to cause vs not to sinne with this iumps the determination of the councell of trent when it saith let him be accursed that saith all workes done any vvay before iustification are sinnes indeed for thus it insinuates closely that will before the grace of iustification partly helped and partly of it selfe can doe that which is good at the least morally as they speak and this is the resolute sentence almost of all papists i doubt not therefore to auouch that the present religion of the church of rome reuiues in part the heresie of pelagius amp in these last daies propounds it again to the world with new varnish and fresh colours to auoide this charge they answer the place of augustine before alleadged thus when pelagius saith the will is of force not to sinne his meaning say they was that will was of force to cause vs neuer to sinne through the course of our liues i answer againe augustine who knew the meaning of pelagius speakes not onely of the life of man but euen of particular actions as appeares by these words he that praies lead vs not into temptation praies that he may not sinne that is that he may not do any euill vincentius lyrinensis tooke this to be the heresie of pelagius that man by his owne free will might doe some good things for these are his words who before that prophane pelagius did euer presume that the vertue of free vvill vvas so great that he did not thinke the grace of god was necessarie for the helping of it in the doing of good things according to euery acte it is obiected to the contrarie that infidel can do things of the law which are good and that they haue bin and are indued with many vertues which are the gifts of god ans infidel may doe things good in their kind but they cannot do the well because they applie the to wrong endes as honour profit pleasure and a good thing done to a wrong ende ceaseth to be good and is euill in the doer againe the vertues of the heathen as they are of god are good yet as they are vsed or rather abused of man they are turned to sinns it is alleadged that wicked pharao did a good worke when he saide i haue sinned the lord is righteous i and my people are sinners pray for me ampc answer this confession is good in his kinde but not good in pharao because it proceeded not of loue to god but of the feare of punishment and it was made in hypocrisie because afterward he hardned his heart further it is alleadged that nabuchadnezzar a heathen man was rewarded of god for sacking of tyrus and that god would not haue rewarded him if his worke had bin a sinne ans the reward was temporall and he was rewarded for his labour only and not for the goodnes thereof lastly it may be obiect d that if we cannot doe good workes by freedome of corrupt will then all our actions our eating drink sleeping buying selling and whatsoeuer we can doe is sinne and no sinne may be done and therefore nothing must be done ans actions before named incident to the life of man are not sinnes of themselues for then they might not be done at all but they are sinnes onely in respect of the manner of doing because they are not done in obedience to god and referred to him as to their right ende but by ends are propounded and this is the condition of euery man till he be conuerted that he can doe nothing but sinne and displease god euen then when the action is praise worthie before man the consideration of this doctrine serues to correct the erronious opinion of many who thinke themselues in good case and highly in the fauour of god because they are not theeues murderers blasphemers adulterers ampc but alas they are deceiued there is matter ynough of codemnation within them though they be no outragious malefactours for all they doe is sinne before god till they be renewed by grace in eating drink sleeping buying selling in all they doe they sinne not that eating drink sleeping buying selling are sinnes in themselues but because they faile in the right manner of doing these actions secondly in that we can do nothing but sinne till we be regenerate we are taught to acknowledge our bondage vnder sinne and satan yes we must labour to feele this bondage amp to grone vnder the burden of it this being don we must goe further yet amp with hungring and thirsting hearts seeke to the mediatour christ who preacheth deliuerace to captiues amp withal giues deliuerance from sinne satan hell death condemnation to all such as with touched and bruised hearts flie vnto him the second question is whether a naturall man by the power of his will may be able to resist and ouercome a teptation the papist answers that he is able to ouercome less and easier temptations of himselfe yes and greater too if he be helped by god and that sundry temptations do not exceed the strength of mans nature but we are to hold and we teach the contrarie that the will of man since the fall of adam can not ouercome so much as the least temptation because the power wherby a temptation should be ouercome is lost and abolished that is the power to nill that which is euill and to will that which is good and where is no power to resist there can be no resistance when we pray to god amp say lead vs not into temptation we acknowledge that there is no temptation at all that we can of our selues withstad without the help of god peter bidds vs resist sathan our aduersarie and he shewes the right meanes when he adds these words stedfast in faith it is obiected that a naturall man can either sinne or not sinne i answer it is true in regard of actions pertaining to outward gouernment and in regard of open sinnes murther theft adulterie ampc yet not alwaies true but onely at some times for euen the righteous sometime fall into open offences and though the naturall man occasioned to sinne abstaine from open offence yet gets he no victorie for though he auoid the outward act yet can not he auoide the wicked inclination of his heart and the abstinence from outward sinne is not without sinne because it proceeds from a person vnreconciled to god it hath not his beginning from faith againe it is for by respects for the getting of praise the auoiding of open shame and not for the honour of god the third question is whether an vnregenerate man by the power of his will can obserue the law though not ully yet in respect of the substance of the act the doctrine of long time hath bin in schooles and church that he can and the doctrine of all papists at this day is that he can if he be helped by god and that by his owne strength he may keep all the morall precepts so as no sinne be comitted bell de grat amp lib arbit l c in fine for some short space of time but the trueth is he can not for if we graunt and suppose an action we must presuppose the ground and beginning thereof now the integritie or sanitie of will whereby it was able to will that which is good is the ground of a good act and it is lost and therefore there can be no keeping of the law in respect of substance the substance of the first table is to loue god with all the heart soule strength and the substance of all negatiue commandemets is thou shalt not lust and the naturall will can not possibly reach to the doing of these it is alleadged that a naturall man may giue almes amp doe iustice to others and such like i answere in the substance of any dutie commanded there be two things the act to be done and the manner of doing it and that is to do it in faith with a minde to obey god and to intend his honour thereby and this manner of doing a worke is the forme of euerie work that makes it to be good indeed and without it workes commaunded in the law are but as a bodie without life or soule or as matter without forme will therefore is vnable to obserue any one commandement or so much as any one worke of a commandement in his owne intire substance and it must be remebred as a maine ground that the law beside externall dueties requires inward obedience in knowledge of god amp his will in faith hope loue patience and the subiection of our thoughts wills and affections to the will of god in respect of this inward and spirituall obedience the holy ghost saith the law is impossible rom ver and that the wisedome of the flesh can not be subiect to the law of god v that this is the yoake which neither we nor our fathers could beare act againe it was the heresie of pelagius that a man by the strength of his owne free will may keepe al the commandements of god though as they say he doth it somewhat hardly and the papists are not farre from this when they say that man by naturall strength may keep the whole law for some litle time the fourth question is whether naturall corrupted will can any way prepare and dispose it selfe to his owne conversion amp iustification that is take away the impediments and make himselfe apt and capable of his iustification the scotus in dist du and ibid doctrine hath bin for diverse hundreds of yeares that will can doe it and the doctrine of the papists now is that the will so it be stirred vp by god can do it but the certen trueth is that will can not the conuersion of a sinner is a creation and no creature can prepare it selfe to his owne creation that very thing libertie of grace whereby a man should prepare himselfe to any good dutie is lost by adams fall and therefore the worke of preparation is god and not ours vnlesse it be possible for a man dead in his sinnes to prepare himself to his own spiritual viuification by nature we are seruats of sinne amp our libertie begins in our iustification therefore before we are iustified we can not so much as will that which is good indeed the israelites prepared their hearts to seeke the lord and ezra prepared his heart to seeke the law of the lord but this was the worke of man regenerate whereby they renued in themselues the purpose of obeying god and of perseuering in dueties of godlinesse the fift and the principall question of all is whether a naturall man can wil his owne conuersion or regeneration the learned among the papists teach on this manner bellar de gr amp lib arb l c that will alone by it selfe can not yet that will can if it be preuented and stirred vp by some good cogitation cast into the minde and some good desire stirred vp in the heart and be withall helped and directed by god they vse to open their mindes by these comparisons the eye in darknesse sees nothing and is as it were without the facultie of seeing yet if an obiect be set before the eie amp light be brought in then can it see againe a man lies a sleepe in a dungeon and he doth not so much as thinke of comming forth yet let a man come and call him and reach downe a corde vnto him he will then awake take hold of the cord put vnder his arme holes as ieremie did amp hag thervpon and being thus helped he both can and doth come forth of the dungeon the doctrine we teach is the plaine contrarie that will before it be turned and conuerted can not so much as will his owne conuersion this followes vpon the former ground for the power to wil that which is truely good is lost a power to will our conuersion is a power to will that which is good therefore the power to will our owne conuersion is lost beside preuenting and exciting motions that serue to stirre vp and help the will there is further required that the will be regenerate before it can will that which is good and without this gift of regeneration which is the true preuenting grace all externall motions and excitations to that which is good are of no effect for the cause must goe before the effect now that the will may affect and will that which is good the cause is the regeneration thereof in which is giuen to the will not onely a new action wherby it wils well but also a new qualitie whereby it is able and can will well and this abilitie of willing well goes before the act of good will as the cause before the effect when a man is dead chafe him and rubbe him put aqua vitae into him to warme him at the heart when this is done take him by the hand plucke him vp and bidde him walke for all this he will not stirre the least ioynt neither can he all chafing and rubbing all speech amp perswasio amp all helps in the world be in vain vnles the soule be restored to the body eue so no perswasions offred to the mind nor good desires to the will are of any moment till the image of god standing in holines which is a conformitie with the will of god and the very soule of our soules begin to be restored nay the minde is vncapable of any good thought and the will of a good desire till god once againe create in them a new qualitie or propertie of holinesse that the minde in thinking may thinke well and the will in willing may will well or will that which is good for though it be the nature of the will to will or nill yet the proper and formall beginning of well willing is the integritie or goodnes of the will it is obiected that the will to accept and receiue grace is in vs before grace be receiued i answer thus the first act of wil whereby the wil in his regeneration begins to assent vnto god amp begins to wil to be conuerted is indeed the worke of the will because it is the will that willeth yet doth it not arise of the naturall strength of the will but from the grace of god that reneweth it for to will to be regenerate is the effect and testimonie of regeneration begunne paul handling the point of the predestination and iustification of a sinner compares god to a potter and vs to clay now the clay before it is framed to a vessell of honour amp while it is in framing it is meerely passiue amp doth nothing at all for the framing of it selfe when a man is to be regenerate god takes away the stonie heart that is by nature disobedient and altogether vnapt to obey and he giues a fleshie heart that is pliable and flexible to obedience now to will to be conuerted is a good thing and one point of true obedience and therefore it proceedes not from the heart of man till it be mollified and framed by god to that which is good what hast thou saith paul that thou hast not receiued and if thou hast receiued it why dost thou boast now if to will to be healed were of vs we haue matter of boasting in our selues againe he saith we are not sufficient or able to thinke a good thought as of our selues but our sufficiencie is of god much lesse then can we of our selues will or desire to be regenerate the health and life of the soule is of god who raiseth vs from death to life now to will to be healed and to will to liue vnto god is the beginning of health and life a certaine councel saith thus if any man doe auouch that god doth expect our will that it may be purged from sinne and doth not confesse that it is the operation of the spirit of god in vs that doth make vs to will to be purged he resists the holy ghost saying by salomon the will is prepared of god augustine saith it is not in him that willeth nor in him that runneth but in god that sheweth mercie that all may be giuen to god who both prepares the will of man to be helped and helps it beeing prepared who preuents him that willeth that he may will and followes him with helpe that willeth that he will not in vaine they which are bodily sicke can will to be healed before they beginne to be healed because they be aliue but they which are spiritually sicke in sinne before their conuersion are dead in their sinne and therefore they can neither thinke or will or desire their conuersion when christ was about to cure a sicke man he mooues this question to him wilt thou be healed and so when god is about the worke of regeneratio in any man he inwardly mooues the question in the heart whether he be regenerate or no and by this meanes stirres vp a desire to be regenerate if any man thinke that by this doctrine man are regenerate against their wills i answer when god beginnes to regenerate vs he makes vs then willing beeing otherwise by nature vnwilling and thus he regenerates vs not against our wills but with our wills yet so as the willingnes to be regenerate is not of vs but of god it may be alleadged further that the act of the will whereby it wills to be conuerted goes before the acte of god whereby he turnes vs to himselfe and that otherwise we are conuerted without our consent and that god workes vpon vs as vpon a blocke or stone answer in respect of time they are both done together but in respect of order of nature first the will begins to be turned of god before it can will to be turned for euery cause is before his effect if not in time yet in prioritie of nature the wil conuerted so soone as god hath begunne to renew it wils to be renewed and it could not will the conuersion of it selfe vnlesse it had formerly tasted the goodnes thereof and though we first feele the desire to be conuerted before the grace of conuersion it is nothing for sometimes we perceiue the effect before the cause as we see the light of the sun before the sun and we see the light of a candle in a house before we see the candle therfore to will to be regenerate may be the effect of regeneration begunne though it first of all appeare for the better clearing of this our doctrine i will propound two other questions the first whether the will of man by his naturall strength be any cause of his owne conuersion the answer of the papist is that the wil is a cause with the grace of god and that both together worke our conuersion grace as the principall will as the lesse principal bellar de gr amp lib arb l c sent and both as causes formally but we teach and hold as the truth is that will in the act of working effecting producing of our conuersion or regeneration is no cause at all but in it selfe considered a meere patient or subiect to receiue the grace of conuersion giuen and wrought by god it is absurd to thinke that a creature should be a cause of his creation or a dead man of his quickning therefore as i thinke the doctrine of them that teach that there are three efficient causes of mans conuersion god spirit god word mans will hath his defect the spirit is the principall cause the word in his right vse is the meanes or instrument wherby the operation of the spirit is effectuall as for the will of man it stands onely as a patient or obiect of diuine operation it is alleadged that man which repent are worthie praise therefore and this can not well be vnlesse repentance proceede from freedome of will i answer repentance is praised because it is a thing that pleaseth god and in that respect praise worthie and the repentant person is praised not because he is the cause of his owne repentance but because he repents beeing thereto inabled by the mercie of god the second question is whether the conuersion of a sinner be in the power of mans will a y way the answer of the papist is that our regeneration and conuersion is in part in the power of mans will so as the will stirred vp can either apply it selfe to the grace of god or reiect the same contrariewise reade cal instit lib c sect we teach that regeneratio is not within the power of mans will but that it wholly depends on the will of god amp that when god wil conuert and renue vs though will for his owne nature be apt to resist yet in respect of god vnchaungeable will and in respect of the efficacie of his inward operation it can not resist and repell the worke of god for when god himselfe workes any thing his worke can not be resisted for his working of a thing is onely to will it to be and his will can not be resisted now in mans conuersion he workes the will and he workes the deed and he causeth man to vvalke in his commandements resistance therefore can not be made secondly the scripture euerie where teacheth that our conuersion amp saluation wholly depends on god wil amp not on the wil of man of the distinction of man amp man in the matter of saluation paul alleadgeth the testimonie of moses it is neither in him that willeth nor in him that runneth but in god that sheweth mercie our sauiour christ teacheth that the secrets of the kingdome of god are reuealed to some and to others concealed because the pleasure of god is so and because this gift of vnderstanding is giuen to some and not to others our conuersion is tearmed a new generation and a new creation for this cause it can not depend on the will of man at all because a creature hath not his creation or generation in his owne will so as he may either accept or refuse it and it is a great ouer shaddowing of god grace to make the hauing or the not hauing of it to be in the choise of mans will but the text in hand is obiected when christ would haue conuerted ierusalem they resisted and would not i answer there is a double worke of god one is outwardly in the word and sacraments to offer grace and this indeed may be resisted of this christ speakes here whe he saith they would not amp stephen whe he saith they resisted the holy ghost the lord saith gen my spirit shall not alway striue vvith man and peter applies this striuing of nohes ministerie saying that christ went in spirit and preached pet the second is when god inwardly by his spirite turnes renues sanctifies the whole man and this worke can not be resisted by the will of man no more then lazarus could resist the worke of christ when he was raised from the dead if it be said that this doctrine abolisheth libertie because it can not choose and refuse the grace of god i answere the angells of god which will good and can not will euill haue neuerthelesse perfect libertie of will and it is greater perfection of libertie freely and onely to will that which is good then to be able to will both good and euill he is at more libertie that can not be a servant then he which maybe either a free man or a servant and a necessitie of yeelding to the will of god is no hurt to our will for it is a speciall libertie to wil that which god wills and nothing else by all this which hath bin said it appeares what is the difference betweene vs and the church of rome in the point of free will they say libertie of grace to will well is onely weakened diminished and held captiue by sinne we say it is quite lost and abolished by the fall of adam againe by the former doctrine the common question is easilie answered namely wherein lies the efficacie of god grace thom cont gent l c greg de val some papists answer that it lies ordinarily in the free consent and cooperation of free will ioyned with grace and this seemes directly to be the opinion of the councell of trent but d b n i thom q amp q this is much derogatorie to the diuine grace of god to place the efficacie thereof in mans will and it ministers much matter of boasting vnto man others place the efficacie of grace in the congruitie of the obiect that is in morall perswasions which god knows to be apt and fit to mooue and allure the will according to the condition therof euen as a beast is moued by the sight of a bottle of hay but there is no efficacie in these perswasions presented to the mind because the will lies in thraldome and bondage vnder sinne and sathan and the wil must not onely be helped but also be deliuered from this bondage before any perswasions can mooue it lumbard in his time much declined from the puritie of the former daies and yet he is farre founder then the jesuit of our daies for he saith thus free will now is hindered by the law of the flesh from doing good and stirred vp to euill so as it can not will and doe good vnlesse it be deliuered and helped by grace we leauing the papists in their dissentions place the efficacie of grace in the grace it selfe for christ saith euerie man that hath heard and learned of the father comes vnto me againe we place it in this that god adds the second grace to the first for hauing giuen the power he staies not there but proceeds further amp giues the will and with the will the deede and thus is the grace of god effectuall the consideration and vse of this amp the former doctrines is of great consequent for if libertie of grace be lost great is the necessitie of our redemption by christ and great is the excellencie thereof secondly this doctrine cuts off the excuse of all sinne for though we sinne necessarily because libertie of grace is lost yet we sinne freely because libertie in euill remaines thirdly it appeares hence that man of himselfe can not haue or retaine any goodnesse but that which god giueth and preserueth in vs this thing must moue vs to pray earnestly for the grace we want and to giue heartie thanks for the graces we haue fourthly we are taught deeplie to huble ourselues for the losse of our libertie and for the bondage vnder sin and to pray instantly for deliuerance by christ fiftly seeing of our selues we can not preuaile against the least temptation we must pray to be guided and assisted continually by god lastly seeing our conuersion depends on god mercie and not on our will we are taught to denie our owne wills wisedome power and to ascribe our iustification and saluation wholly and onely to god the third estate of man is the estate of regeneration in which the wil hath power to will partly that which is good and partly that which is euill as daily experience declareth in the liues of iust man and the reason is because the will of man renued hath in it a three fold libertie the first is the libertie of nature to will or nill which is in all man the second is libertie of s ne whereby the wil when it willeth any euill willeth it freely and this libertie is diminished according to the measure of grace which god bestoweth the third is libertie of grace to will that which pleaseth god and it is restored in part in regeneration so far forth as libertie to sinne is diminished and because these three alwayes remaine in the will to the death therefore sometimes it willeth well sometime euill sometime both and in the best actions we doe there is a mixture because they are not perfectly good for the time of this life but partly good and partly euill that this power of the will may the better appeare i will propound foure questions the first is whether the will preuented or renued haue any stroake action or operatio in the first regeneration of a sinner i answer in the renouation or conuersion of a sinner i consider two things first the beginning or ground thereof and that is the setting or imprinting of new qualities and inclinations in the minde will affections of the heart and this is the intire or meere worke of god in vs and vpon vs and we in it are merely passive not active the second is the euidence of the former in new and spirituall actions as namely in thinking willing and desiring that which is good now these actions are workes of god in and by mans will and mans will is not onely a subiect of them but also an instrument a subiect in that god is the first and principall worker of these workes in the will an instrument because it pleaseth god to vse the will and to mooue it by his grace for the acting and effecting of the things which he appointeth and thus the will is not merely passiue but passiue and actiue both first passiue and then actiue for beeing acted and mooued by god who works the will and the deede it also acteth and mooueth and we doe not vtterly denie the co operation of mans will with god grace it is necessarie indeed that god first regenerate vs and make vs his children and new creatures and in this thing we doe not co worke with god but stand as patients that god may worke vpon vs and reforme vs euen in the same manner as when he made vs in the beginning without any helpe of ours yet after our regeneratio by faith we are brought from life to death and to will is present with vs though in weake measure by reason of the remainders of corruption and then we begin to be co workers with the grace of god mooued to will and so indeede willing that which is good in this sense haue the learned said that which is repaired in vs is not repaired without vs and that god in them whome he calls prepares the will that it may be a receiuer amp handmaid of his gifts the same answer in effect i propound an other way in the worke of our regeneration three graces be required the preuenting grace the working grace and the co working grace the preuenting grace is when god of his mercy sets and imprints in the mind a new light in the will a new qualitie or inclination in the heart new affections the working grace is when god giues to the will the acte of well willing namely velle credere velle resipiscere velle ob dire the will to beleeue the will to repent the will to obey god in his word the co working grace is when god giues the deede to the will that is the exercise and practise of faith and repentance the first giues the power of doing good the second the will the third the deede and all three togither make the worke of regeneration now the wil of man in respect of operation doth not concurre with god preuenting grace but is merely patient as a subiect to receiue grace for it is the proper worke of god to set or imprint a new facultie or inclination in the will and that without any action of the saide will neuerthelesse the will beeing once renewed and preuented concurreth by his operation with the working and co working grace of god for the wil beeing mooued by grace willeth and doth indeede that whereto it is mooued and the will to obey god or to performe any like dutie proceedes ioyntly from two causes from grace in that it mooueth and causeth the will to will to beleeue from the will of man in that beeing preuented and mooued by god it willeth to beleeue or to do any like dutie and therefore the ancient saying hath his truth he that made thee without thee doth not regenerate or saue thee without thee because our conuersion is not without the motion and consent of will as our creation was and that we doe not mistake in this point the order that is betweene mans will and god grace must here againe be remembred in respect of time they are both together and concurre in the very first moment of our regeneration in respect of the order of nature the will doth not first begin that which is good and then after borrowe aide from grace but grace preuents renues and mooues the will and then the will mooued or changed wils to be conuerted and to be healed in the first instant of conuersion this operation of the will to wil to beleeue to will to repent and to obey is the least grace and signe of god fauour for nothing can be lesse then to wil to do that which is good yet is it of great amp excellet price for it hath the promise of god annexed to it the prophet saith to the rebellious israeelites wash and make you cleane cease to doe euill learne to doe well now they might peraduenture say alas we can not wash our selues he therefore addes if ye will and obey that is if ye doe but will to be clensed and testifie this will by your endeauour to obey ye shall eate the good things of the land and christ saith that the heauenly father giueth the holy ghost to the that desire him and to them that are in christ god accepts this acte of goodwill for the deede it selfe marke the comfort that flowes from this doctrine the ful obedience to the law of god is impossible to all man except christ in this life yes to them which are conuerted and sanctified and greatly desire the fulfilling of the law in themselues and therefore no man can be iustified by it before god and obtaine saluation thereby neuerthelesse saith in christ and repentance is so farre forth possible to all that will and haue a desire that whosoeuer doe but will in earnest to beleeue and to be couerted doe indeede beleeue and are conuerted and please god and shal not perish eternally though the beginning of faith and conuersion be weake so it be in truth and not counterfeit and yet such is the naughtines of our nature that faith and conuersion is impossible vnto vs vnlesse of the singular mercie of god it be stirred vp in the hearts of the elect by his holy spirit in this respect christ saith math my yoke is easie and my burden light and againe his commandements are not grieuous it may be obiected that the will amp desire of renouation and reconciliation with god may be where there is a mind and purpose to sinne and where is no true hatred and detestation of iniquitie answer the serious and instant will or desire to beleeue in christ and to repent includes in it the hatred of sinne and the purpose of not sinning for he that truly desires to beleeue doth so because he detests his vnbeleefe and he that desires to repent doth so because he hates his owne euill waies and purposeth to sinne no more the second question is whether the will after it is renewed be able to cause and bring forth good workes of it selfe or no i answer two things the first that will cannot vnlesse god further giue a double grace the one is assisting grace and it stands in three actions preseruation confirmation protection preseruation is whereby god continues the being of the will renewed for that which is good doth not continue good the least moment vnlesse god make it to continue confirmation is when god fixeth the minde in that which is good and causeth the will constantly to follow the good inclination thereof it being otherwise mutable and apt to decline protection is whereby god defends his grace in vs against the violence of temptation of this he saith to peter sathan hath desired to sift you but i haue prayed for thee that thy faith faile not and god promiseth that he will not suffer the faithfull to be tempted aboue that they are able to beare the second grace may be called exciting grace whereby god mooues and stirres vp the will that it may indeede will and doe the good to be done and this grace is ordinarily required to the effecting of euerie good worke dauids will was exceedingly renued by the holy ghost yet he prayes still incline mine heart vnto thy testimonies the christian soule that is alreadie drawne to christ prayeth still dravv me and we will runne after thee paul saith they which are the children of god are guided mooued or stirred by the spirite of god againe he saith of the philippians after they were renued amp wrought their owne saluation with feare amp trebling that god did stil worke in them beside the power the act of willing and of doing that which is good and he works the will by moouing it to will and to doe indeede that which it can will and doe and this moouing cause is the good will of god it may not seeme straunge that i say new grace is required to stirre vp the will to the doing of euerie new worke for grace in the will is like a fire of greene woode which hardlie burnes and continues not to burne vnlesse it be continually stirred vp and blowed euen so the good inclination of the will because it is ioyned nay mixed with contrarie corruption that presseth downe tempteth inticeth and draweth away the will from god and all goodnesse hath neede continually to be excited stirred and mooued the man regenerate is able to pray to god yet can he not pray sometime by reason of the weight of corruption vnles the spirite help to beare the infirmities of nature and make request in vs by stirring and moouing vs to make request the doctrine of the auncient church hath beene that new grace is to be giuen to the doing of euery good act and de praedest nctor c that we doe not that good which we can doe vnlesse god make vs doe it as he made vs able to doe it this doctrine must the rather be remembred because the streame of popish doctrine runnes another way by teaching that our wills assisted by grace can doe good without the concurrence of new grace to excite and stirre vp the will indeed for the doing of naturall actions the generall cooperation of god suffiseth but to the effecting of actions supernaturall the speciall help of god is required a child that can goe vp and downe in an euen flore being staid by the mothers hand for all this it can not goe vp a paire of staires vnlesse it be lifted at euerie step like is the case of the children of god in thinges which concerne the kingdome of heauen the second part of the answere is that when renued will doth a good worke it doth it not perfectly to will saith paul is present vvith me but i can not performe the good i would that is i can not perfectly doe it as i would it may be obiected thus the workes of god are perfect good workes done by vs are workes of god therefore they are perfect i answere to the major or first part of the reason it is true of such workes as are workes of god alone and not of such as are workes ioyntly both of god and man god being the principall agent and man the instrument for then the worke done takes vnto it the qualitie and condition of man considering it proceeds from god through the sinnefull minde and will of man the scriuener when he writes by himselfe he writes a perfect hand but when a learner and he write both together he taking the learners hand into his owne then that which is written will carrie the imperfection of the learner like is the case in all such workes as are from god in and by vs the third question is whether the reliques of corruptio be of that force in sinning that they can vtterly quench the spirit of god in the renued will the answere is that corruption remaining is of it selfe apt to doe it and the grace of god spirit is apt to be extinguished because of it selfe it is mutable neuertheles it wholly amp vtterly cannot be lost for causes the first is the promise of god in the couenant of grace i will put my feare into their hearts that they shall not depart from me and this promise particularly belonges to all them that truely beleeue because it is the promise of the euangelicall couenant the second is the intercession of christ in the behalfe of all the elect christ saith to peter sathan hath desired to sift you as wheate but i haue prayed for thee peter that thy faith faile not and this he did especially in that solemne praier made john in which he prayed not onely for peter but for all the apostles and for all that did or should beleeue in him the third cause is the omnipotent power of god in preseruing all the that are in christ no man saith christ taketh my sheepe forth of my hand and marke the reason my father is greater then all the last cause is the efficacie of god spirit s john saith that the seede of god remaines in him that is borne a new and that this seede keepes him that he neither doth nor can sin in two respects first if he sinne yet he sinnes not with full consent of will for he hates and nills in part the euill which he willeth secondly if by humane frailtie he fall he makes not a trade of sinne neither doth he keep a course in wickednesse but the seed of grace remayning within causeth him to returne to god and to recouer himfelfe by new repentance the last question is whether the renued will can of it selfe perseuere in doing good i answere that our perseuerance dependes and proceedes onely from the will of god that we may perseuere two things are required the power to perseuere and the wil of perseuerance and both these being good things are of god because euery good giuing and euery good gift is from aboue and commeth downe from the father of lights this former doctrine is of great vse in that the new birth amp regeneration of a sinner is not without the motio of his owne will we are taught that we must if we desire our owne saluation vse the good meanes and striue against our owne corruptions and endeauour earnestly by asking seeking knocking it wil be said that faith repentance and the rest are all giftes of god i answer there is no vertue or gift of god in vs without our wills and in euerie good act god grace amp mans will concurre god grace as the principall cause mans wil renewed as the instrument of god and therefore in all good things industrie and labour and inuocation on our parts is required secondly this doctrine ministers true cofort to all true servant of god for if when they vse the good meanes of saluation the word praier sacraments the will lie not dead but begin to oppose it selfe against vnbeleefe and other corruptions and withall doe but so much as will to beleeue will to repent will to be turned to god they haue begunne to turne vnto god and god hath begun to regenerate them so be it this will in them to doe the good they ought to doe be in good earnest vnfained and they withall be carefull to cherish this little graine till it come to a bigger quantitie thirdly seeing to euery new act that pleaseth god new grace is required we are taught not to presume of our owne wisdome will and strength nor to glorie in any thing we doe but alwaies to acknowledge our owne impotencie and in euery good thing we doe to giue all the glorie to god and to be watchfull in praier continually because we stand by grace so long as we stand and hauing done one worke we doe not the second but by a continued supplie of new grace lastly seeing god preuenting and working grace turnes our wills and makes them of vnwilling most willing wills all our obedience must be voluntarie and come from such freenesse of will as if there were no bond in the law of god to force and compell vs thereto the people of god that are turned and guided by the free spirit of god must be a voluntarie people and with all alacritie and cheerefulnes doe the duties that pertaine to them of a readie minde euen as if there were neither heauen nor hell iudge nor iudgement after this life the spirit of life that is in christ must be a law vnto them the last estate is the estate of glorification after this life in this estate the libertie of will is a certen freedom onely to will that which is good and pleasing vnto god for it is the continuall voice as it were and crie of the glorified will i doe no euill and i will not doe it i doe that which is good and i will doe it and this indeed is the perfect libertie in which mans wil is conformed to the free will of god and good angels who will onely that which is good and can not will that which is euill by this which hath bin saide it appeares that the wordes of the text in hand and ye would not are spoken of the will of man according to the estate of corruption for the voice of the regenerate will is i doe that which is euill but i would not doe it i doe that which is good but i can not doe it as i would and the voice of the corrupted will is i doe that which is euill and i will doe it i doe not that which is good and i will not doe it and this last voice is plainely expressed in these wordes and ye would not the third point comes now to be considered namely the harmonie or consent of both wills for the wordes are i would ye would not here it may iustly be demanded whether there be an harmonie or consent betweene god will and mans will and how it stands with this text i answer there is an excellent harmonie and generally it stands in this that god will hath a soueraigne lordship ouer the will of man and mans will stands subiect to it absolutely and simply depends vpon it and by this meanes where man hath a will god hath an antecedent will and where mans will hath any stroke or action there god will formerly had his stroke and action furthermore mans will depends on god will in respect of three things namely sustentation determination ordination or gouernmet it depends on the will of god in respect of sustentation because mans wil for his nature strength and all his motions depends on the will of god and could not haue beeing for the space of one moment vnlesse it were vpholden by god it may be obiected that if god sustaine the will which is sinnefull he sustaines not onely the will but also the sinne thereof answer god sustaines nature and not the sinne of nature amp threfore he only sustaines will as will and not as it is corrupt or sinnefull will the like we see in nature when a man halts in walking the motion of the bodie is from the soule and is preserued by it but the halting which goes with the motion and disorders it is not from the soule neither hath it his preseruation thence but fro a defect in the legge or foote by this we are taught to acknowledge the endlesse long suffering of god who sustaines the members of our body our soules the faculties and actions thereof euen in the workes in which man offend amp dishonour him secondly we are taught to acknowledge the vile abhomination of euery sinne for we sinne in the very hands of god sustaining and preseruing vs and in the very actions which we could not doe vnlesse we were sustained by him we offend him and prouoke him to anger against vs secondly mans will depends on god will in respect of determination because we netiher can nor doe will any thing without the will of god a sparrow saith christ lights not on the ground without the heauenly father that is without his decree or will the malitious and wicked wil of the iewes could not so much as will much lesse doe any thing against christ but that which the hand and counsell of god had determined to be done moreouer god determines the will two waies in good things he inwardly mooues and inclines the will to the willing and doing of the good it willeth for in that god will is the first cause of all good things mans will depends on it in respect of vertue in respect of application and in respect of order of working in respect of vertue because the vertue of second causes proceed from the first in respect of application because god vseth the will of man as an instrument of his owne will and he applieth it to the doing of things which he intendeth euen as the carpenter vseth mooueth and applieth his tooles in respect of order of working because alwaies the first cause begins the work and the second mooues not without the first vpon this ground it follows that the good things which man willeth he so willeth because god first willed them and therefore paul saith that good workes are prepared of god for vs to walke in and this preparation is made because god decrees and determines with himselfe the doing of all works to be done in euill things the determination of god is vol ndone impedite to will not to hinder them as he may vpon this will in god followes sinne in the will of man as a cosequent not as an effect as a consequet because when god suspends or withdrawes sustentation and gouernment from the will it cannot of it selfe but will amisse as the staffe in my hand presently falls when i do but pull backe my hand to auoide euill is good and therefore we cannot auoide the least euill vnlesse god make vs able to auoide it and c euill is not the effect of god wil because god puts nothing into mans will to cause it to wil amisse but he onely ceases to conferre vnto it helpe and direction which he is not bound to conferre here long and tedious disputes are made by many touching the concord of god decree and the libertie of mas will and it is alleadged that mans will looseth his libertie and ceaseth indeede to be will if it stand subiect to the necessarie and vnchaungeable decree of god i answer first that when the will of man determines it selfe to one thing it doth not loose his libertie much more then may the libertie of will stad with the determination of god secondly god decree doth not abolish libertie but onely moderate and order it by suauiter inclinando inclining the will in milde and easie manner with fitt and conuenient obiectes and that according to the condition of the will that christ should die when he died it was necessarie in respect of god decree yet if we respect the constitution of his nature he might still haue prolonged his daies amp if we consider the will of christ he died most freelie and willingly otherwise his death had bin no satisfaction for sin god himselfe doth some things of an absolute necessitie and yet with perfect freedome of will now then if absolute necessitie doe not abolish freedome of will much lesse shall conditionall necessitie depending on god decree doe it lastly the decree of god establisheth the libertie of will for his determination is that the agencie of second causes shall be according to their condition so as naturall causes shall worke naturally free causes freely necessarie causes necessarily contingent causes in contingent and variabl sorte and therefore the necessarie decree of god is that man shall will this or that not necessarily in respect of himselfe but freely thirdly mans will depends on god will in respect of gouernment this gouernment is of two sortes first he gouernes the wills of the righteous by working his owne good worke in them and by them in them because he mooues and inclines them by his spirite by them because they are holie instruments of his will secondly he gouernes the wills of the wicked and vngodlie by sixe actions the first is permission when god withdrawes his grace from the will not inlightning the minde nor inclining the will but leauing it to it selfe as when a man giues the rene to a wilde horse the second is a deliuerie of the will to sathan and that is when god iues the diuell libertie to tempt assault and vexe the will of man being left to it selfe and this thing is incident to obstinate sinners and we pray against it in these words lead vs not into temptation the third action is a ceasing to restraine corruption of will either in whole or in part as whe he restraines al sinnes saue one or hauing restrained for a time for the punishment of former sinne he omits restraint permitting man to the lusts of his owne heart the fourth action is the bending moouing or inclining of the wicked will and this god doth not by inward inspiration for then he should be the cause of sinne but by presenting to the minde and will obiects good or at the least indifferent in themselues vpon which obiectes the will takes occasion to be more willfull obstinate and rebellious not mooued thereto by god but freely moouing it selfe the heate of the stomacke in the winter season i increased not by the heate of thinges taken inwardly but by the cold of the aire euerie way compassing the body an vnbroken horse being spurred because he goes out of order he flinges out and castes his rider and thus the sinnefull will of man vrged by commandements threatnings iudgements allured by promises and blessings growes more sinnefull and wicked paul saith that sinne tooke occasion vpon the good commandement of god to reuiue and to be sinfull out of measure dauid saith that god moued the hearts of the egyptians to hate his people but how he blessed the israelites exceedingly more then the egyptians and vpon this worke of god they tooke occasion to envy and to hate the israelites the fift action is ordination whereby god vseth well the wickednesse of the wil of man and directeth it against the nature thereof to good endes euen as the learned physicion sometime of poyson makes a remedie in this sense assur is called the rod of his indignation and the medes amp persians his sanctified ones the iewes in the crucifying of christ vvilled and minded nothing but his death and destruction yet god willed and by them wrought the redemption of mankinde he workes his owne good worke by mans will as by an actiue instrument and withall he leaues the will to it selfe to worke his owne euill worke the last action of god is when a man is going on in his owne wickednesse he turnes him vnto himselfe of his exceeding mercie and sometimes againe he opens a way that that person who of himselfe runnes into wickednesse may rush headlong to his owne destruction for the further exequution of diuine iustice as when an house is falling th owner thereof will not vnderpropp it neither will he push it downe but he takes away al impediments and digges away the earth round about it not touching the foundation that when it falls it may fall downe right thus we see brieflie the harmonie of mans will and god will now let vs come to the vse which is manyfold first of all by the former doctrine we are brought to a right vnderstanding of many places of scripture the lord saith of pharao i will harden his heart and this he is said to doe not because he setts and imprintes hardnesse in his heart but because by sundrie actions he orders and gouernes his wicked will and they are foure first he permits pharao to his owne will secondly he leaues him to the malice of the diuell and the lustes of his owne heart thirdly he vrges him with a commandement to let the people goe and pharao the more he is vrged the stiffer and stubberner he is amp the more he rebells against god wheras he ought indeed to haue bin the more obedient lastly god vseth the hardnesse of pharaos heart to the manifestation of his owne iustice and iudgement and therefore he opens him a way that he may runne headlong to his owne destruction in this manner and no otherwise are the places to be vnderstoode when the scripture saith that god put a lying spirit into the mouthes of the prophets of ahab that if a prophet be deceiued the lord deceiued him that he giues vp man to reprobate mindes that he senas strong illusions to beleeue lies in the booke of samuel it is saide the lord commanded shemi to curse dauid because about this cursing there is a twofold actio in god one that he restrains the wicked heart of shemi in respect of all other sinnes and not in respect of this sinne of railing to which god leaues him the second he vseth him as an instrument to correct and to huble dauid and thus likewise must the places be vnderstood when it is saide that god deliuered the wiues of dauid to absolom and that he stirred vp dauid to number the people lastly ioseph saith that the lord sent him into egypt and that for two causes one because when his brother were about to make him away god by his prouidence caused marchants to passe by in their sight whereupon they tooke occasion to sell him into egypt the second because god disposed this fact of theirs to the good of iacob and his familie in time to come and thus are all like places of scripture to be vnderstoode againe some schoole diuines following damascen make amp ascribe to god an applied or depending will on this manner god for his part would haue all man without exception to be saued why then are they not saued they theselues will not and because they will not god therefore chooseth some and refuseth others but according to the former doctrine i take this kinde of applied will to be an inuention of mans braine for the contrarie is the truth namely that mas will wholly depeds on the will of god that vessels be some of honor some of dishonor it is not in the power of the clay but in the will of the potter the first cause orders the second and not the second the first to make god wil depend on mans will is to put god out of his throne of maiestie and to set the creature in his roome others set forth the depending wil of god on this manner god say they decrees nothing in particular of things that are casuall amp contingent but he foresees within himselfe what the will of the creature will doe or not doe when things are thus or thus ordered and vpon this foresight he consequently determines what shall be done but this opinion as it giues vnto god a common or generall prouidence so it takes away the certen determination of god touching all particular euents and it is absurd to think that god should foresee the future acts of mans freewill when as yet he hath determined nothing for things that shall be are therefore to come to passe because god by decree hath determined their beeing and therefore the foreknowledge of things that shall be followes the decree of god and if god decree presuppose mans willing of this or that and thereupon determine how shal that speach of the lord stand i will cause them to walke in my statutes for hereby is signified that god doth not attend on the will of man but brings mans will in subiection to himselfe and therefore this attending will ascribed to god is improoued euen of the papists themselues thirdly in that mans wil stands subiect absolutely to the pleasure of god our dutie is to yeelde voluntarie subiection to him in all things when his wil is made manifest vnto vs lastly this doctrine of the consent and concurrence of mans will amp god will must be the stay and ground of our patience and comfort for there is no calamitie or miserie that betides vs by and from the will of man without the will of god the creature can will nothing against vs vnlesse it be first the will of god and it can doe neither more nor lesse then god will the devil could not touch iob without leaue and he could not enter into the heard of swine without leaue vpon this ground dauid speakes to this effect let shemi curse for he curseth because the lord bids him doe so ioseph comforts himselfe and his brother in this that not they so much as the lord sent him into egypt as there is an harmonie betweene god wil amp mans wil so there is a dissent between mas will amp god word or his signifying will as appeares by the text in hand hales summae q thomas in q amp contra gen iles l c roffensis in refutant bell de grat amp lib arb l c schoolemen vpon this dissent make a distinction of god grace into sufficient and effectuall sufficient they call that whereby a man may be saued if he will not be wanting to himselfe effectuall whereby a man is indeede saued the first they say is giuen to all man at one time or other the second is not and this distinction of grace they gather on this manner when christ would haue gathered the iewes they would not therefore they had not effectuall grace and because they would not they are blamed and rebuked by christ therefore saith the papist god gaue them sufficient grace to be conuerted if they would els could he not haue blamed them i answer this prooues that once god gaue them sufficient grace to obey any commandement of his namely in the creation but hence cannot be gathered that when god called the iewes by his word that then then i say he gaue them sufficient grace secondly it is obiected that god did all that might be don to his vine to make it bring forth good fruit and yet for all this it brought forth nothing but wild grapes therefore it is saide there must needs be a grace sufficient to saluation which is not effectuall i answer god did that to his vineyard that was sufficient to make a good vine bring forth fruit and that is the meaning of the place in isai though not sufficient to change the nature of an euill vi e and to make it a good vine it is vrged that the lord saith he waited for grapes which he would not haue done vnlesse there had been hope by reason of sufficient grace giuen i answer again that the lord waited for fruit not because god then gaue them sufficient grace when he waited but because the church of the iewes was in shew and pretence a good vine and thereby gaue hope of good fruit thirdly it is obiected that adam receiued sufficient grace and that he had not effectuall grace because he fell i answer adam had sufficient to the perfection of a creature but not sufficient to vnchangeable perseuerance specially if he should be assaulted by temptation likewise he had grace effectuall in respect of righteousnesse and happinesse but not in respect of perseuerance in both grace in him so farre forth as it was sufficient to happinesse it was also effectuall lastly it is obiected that god forsakes no man till he first forsake god and therefore that god for his part giues grace sufficient to saluation answer there is a double kind of forsaking in god one is for triall the other for punishment the forsaking which is for trialls sake goes before mans sinne in which he forsakes god in this regard adam was for order of nature first forsaken of god before he forsooke god the forsaking which is for punishment alwaies followes after sinne and of this must the rule be vnderstood that they which are forsaken of god did first forsake god now the trueth which we are to hold in this point is thus much there is a grace which is sufficient to the conuiction of a sinner which is not effectuall to saluation and againe there is a grace which is sufficient to the leading of a ciuill life which is not effectuall to saluation yet the grace which is indeed sufficient to saluation is also effectuall namely the gift of regeneration in which god giues not onely the power to be conuerted but also the will and the deed thus much of the harmonie nowe comes the fourth point to be considered namely in what manner christ willed the conuersion of hierusalem he willed it first in loue secondly in patience his loue is set forth by two things the first albeit he was god full of maiestie and we vile wretches his enemy by nature yet was he content to take vpon him a vile and base condition to be vnto the iewes as an hen the second was that he takes vnto him the fashions the disposition and tender affection of the henne to her young ones that all this may the better be conceiued three questions are to be propounded the first is whether there be such an affection of loue in god as is in man and beast i answere that affections of the creature are not properly incident vnto god because they make many changes and god is without change and therefore all affections and the loue that is in man and beast is ascribed to god by figure and that for two causes first because there is in god an vnchangeable nature that is well pleased with euery good thing and a will that seriously willeth the preseruation of euery good thing and of this nature and will of god the best loue in the creature is but a light shaddow secondly the affection of loue is ascribed to god because he doth the same things that loue makes the creature doe because he bestoweth blessings and benefits vpon his creature as the louer doth on the person loued in this sort are all other affections ascribed to god and no otherwise the second question is whether there be in god an hatred of his creatures for god is copared to the henne which loueth all her young ones ans if hatred be taken for a passion incident to man it is not incident to god if it be taken for a worke of god prouidence and iustice it is in god and that in three respects first of al in scripture hatred sometime signifies a deniall of loue and mercie as when it is said that he which will follow christ must hate father and mother that is neglect them or not loue them in respect of christ in this sense hatred agrees vnto god for he is said to loue iacob and to hate esau that is not to loue esau with that loue wherewith he loued iacob againe there is in god nature that abhorreth and detesteth iniquitie thus saith the psalmist that god loueth righteousnesse and hateth iniquitie and thus god hates man not simply because he is the handiworke of god but because he is a sinner and by reason of the worke of the deuill in man namely sinne which is simply hated of god thirdly god plagueth and punisheth offenders and in this regard he is said to hate them thus saith dauid that god hates the workers of iniquitie and destroies them that speake lies by this which hath beene said it appeares that there be two degrees of hatred in god one is negatiue when god as an absolute lord bestowes his speciall loue on some and denies it vnto others because his pleasure is so the second is positiue when he hates and detests his creature and this second alwaies followes sinne and is euer for sinne but the other goes before sin and whereas it is said in this text that god is as the henne that loueth all her chickins and gathereth them all together it must be vnderstood that our sauiour christ here sets downe his dealing not with all his creatures and with all mankind but onely his dealing toward his owne church in which he calleth all outwardly by the sound of his word and receiues all outwardly into the couenant by this which hath beene said we are taught after the example of god to hate amp detest iniquitie and yet alwaies to make difference betweene the person and the sinne the third question is in what thing is christ as an henne to his church answer in temporall blessings and deliuerances in afflictions and manifold corrections but specially and principally in his word published in the ministery of the prophets for it is the wing which he spred ouer his people and it is the voice whereby he called and as it were clocked them vnto him thus we see the meaning of the similitude that christ would haue gathered hierusalem as the henne gathereth her chickins nowe followes the vse by this we see the tender loue of god to this church and land for it hath pleased him to propound vnto vs the gospell of saluation and that nowe more then yeres and in so doing he hath offered long to imbrace vs in the armes of his mercy and in spreading his wing ouer vs to become our god and our sauiour for this tender loue our hearts must be filled with loue to christ and our mouthes with praise againe we learne hence that the gospell brings all other blessings of god with it for god in it communicates his owne selfe vnto vs as the hen to her young ones the kingdome of god brings all things else with it that may serue for the good of man and where the gospell is imbraced there is god kingdome the peace and protection of this church and land wherby we haue bin preserued from beeing a pray to our enemy comes by meanes of the gospell of life therefore foolish and false is the conceit of sundrie popish persons that say there was neuer such plentie in the world as when the olde learning as they say or old religion was secondly by this we are aduertised if we would haue all necessarie blessings for this life first of all to imbrace the gospell of christ thirdly if christ take vnto him the disposition of the henne we likewise must take vnto vs the disposition of the chicken in respect of christ and that in three things first we must suffer our selues to be gathered to christ that is to be turned vnto him from all our sinnes to beleeue in him to be of the same minde and disposition with him to suffer him to quicken vs with his heauenly and spirituall life as the henne cherisheth her chickins by sitting on them secondly we must attend vpon the word and wil of christ as the chickin vpon the call of the hen and suffer him to rule vs both in heart and life for all things the third thing is that we must depend on the sweete and mercifull promises of christ and shroud our selues vnder his wing against hell sathan death damnation and verely all such among vs who are not carefull to performe these three things to christ are no better then monstrous rebels considering he hath in his mercifull and tender loue sought to win vs to himselfe for the space of this yeares thus much of the loue of christ nowe i come to his patience in these words howe often would i the meaning whereof is this you haue continually from time to time prouoked me by your sinnes yet did i not withdraw my loue from you but sent my prophets from time to time vnto you to call you and gather you vnto me and this patience of god is here expressed to aggrauate the rebellion of ierusalem i will therefore speake a little of it and first it may be demanded whether the vertue of patience that is in man be also in god i answer properly it is not for where this kind of patience is there is passion and sufferance now god is not subiect to any passion or sufferance because his nature is vnchangeable againe that which is in god properly is in him eternally this patience is not in him eternally but for the time of the continuance of this world neuertheles scripture ascribes this patience to god for two causes the first is because there is in god an infinite goodnesse of will and nature wherby he neuer simply wills the perdition or destruction of any creature thus saith ezechiel god wills not that is takes no delight in the death of a sinner and whereas it is said that vengeance is god and he will repay it must be thus taken that god in reuege doth not absolutely intend to destroy but onely to exequute iustice in the punishment of sinne it may be obiected that god is saide to make vessells of vvrath prepared to destruction i answer this place must circumspectly and warily be vnderstood and i take the meaning of it to be this that god makes vessels of wrath or vessells for wrath by his will and decree whereby he decrees to passe by some and to forsake them in respect of his loue and mercie and this acte of god in passing by and in forsaking of man is as it were to set them a part to becom vessels of wrath and though god in secret and iust iudgement doe this yet he neuer fills any of these vessels with his wrath till they haue bin tainted with iniquitie and though they be prepared to destruction yet they are neuer indeede destroied but for their sinnes thus then by reason of this excellent and incomprehensible goodnesse of god whereof the vertue of patience is but a shadow god is said to be patient the second cause why god is saide to be patient is because he doth the same things that patient man doe first he inuites man to repentance secondly he promiseth pardon thirdly he deferres punishment fourthly at the first he onely inflicts less punishments when they doe no good he inflicts greater and lastly when there is no hope of amendment he inflicts euerlasting death and destruction the ende of god patience is twofold one that the elect of god may be gathered and called the other that all excuse might be taken from the vngodly the patience of god is either vniuersall or particular vniuersall which pertaines to all man the decree of diuine iustice was set downe to adam amp in him to all mankind when thou shalt eate of the forbidden fruit in dying thou shalt die that is presently die the first and second death dathan and abiram presently vpon their rebellio went downe into the earth quick the captaines with their fifties were presently vpon their comming to elijah destroied with fire from heauen and so oft as any man sinnes he deserues present destruction and so many sinnes as we haue committed so many damnations haue we deserued here it may be demanded why god doth not execute his decree accordingly i answer god in iustice remembers mercie yes his iustice giues place to mercie for there is an other decree of mercie which he will haue as well to be accoplished as the decree of iustice and that is the seede of the woman shall bruise the serpents head againe aske of me and i vvill giue thee the heathen for thine inheritance and the endes of the earth for thy possession that mercie then may be shewed vpon mankind iustice is exequuted in great patience by certen decrees and this patience pertaines to all man without exception that come of adam by generation speciall patience is that which concerns particular man or cuntries thus god spared the olde world yeares before he sent the flood he spared the amorites till their iniquities were full he spared the egyptians yeares he deferred the punishment of the idolatry of israel yeares and then he punished it with yeares captiuitie he winked at the ignorance of the gentiles yeares antichrist shall not terly be destroied till the comming of christ whe man blaspheme god and christ swearing wounds blood heart sides nailes life if they had their desert they should descend to hell quicke and that presently but god forbeares them and sundrie such persons are vouchsafed the grace of true repentance the very least offender vpon earth is partaker of the great patience of god for he sustaines the members of our body the powers and motions of the soule in such actions in which we offend him and no creature can sufficiently consider the greatnesse of this long suffering the vse to be made of the patience of god follows first it serues to teach all man to turne to god by true repentance rom despisest thou the patience and long suffering of god knowing that the goodnes of god leads thee to repentance pet god is patient towards vs and would haue no man to perish but would all man to come to repentance to come more neere to our selues and this english nation now is the day of our visitation and hath bin for the space of this fourtie yeares and more in which god in great patience hath continually called vpon vs knocked at the dore of our hearts and stretched out the armes of his mercie vnto vs wherefore the common dutie of all english people is to turne vnto god with all their hearts according to all the law of god as it is said of iosias and that this dutie may indeed be practised i will vse certaine reasons that may serue to stirre vp our dead minds first the time of the continuance of the patience of god is hidde amp vnknowne vnto vs and hereupon when man abusing the patience of god shall say peace peace then then shall come sudden destruction as trauaile vpon a woman and therefore the time is to be redeemed and as s peter saith we must watch and make hast for the coming of the lord secondly the greater the patience of god is and hath beene the greater shall his anger be a blow the longer it is in comming the greater it is yes the very wrath of god in it selfe is most horrible the wrath of a lyon of a prince yes the wrath of all creatures to the wrath of god is but a droppe of water to the whole sea at his indignation the very mountaines melt the heauens amp the elements shall melt at his coming much more should our rockie amp stony hearts melt thirdly god hath his treasurie amp storehouses for iudgement and they which goe on in their sinnes from day to day fill this treasurie of god with wrath and iudgements against the day of wrath and whe man turne heartily fro their euill waies this treasurie is emptied as appears by the exaple of the niniuites wherefore let vs all fro the highest to the lowest bethinke our selues what evil we haue done and how we haue abused the mercifull patience of god amp make speed to turne to god and christ our mercifull sauiour some will say we abuse not god patience we haue repented long agoe i answer the number of them that truly turne vnto god in their hearts is but small in comparison euen as the gleaning is to the whole haruest it will be said againe we are not as the iewes that denied iesus christ to be the messias i answer we confesse christ in word but there is a great multitude among vs that denie him in their deedes and naughtie liues for to omit the sinnes of the second table there be fiue notorious sins that are common among vs wilfull ignorance in that man haue little or no care to knowe god and to knowe the way of life the secod is the prophane contempt of the gospell for nowe the obedience to this blessed doctrine of life yes the very shewe of it is in common reputation precisenes and now a daies vnder this name the profession of the gospell comes otherwhiles vpon the stage to helpe to make vp the plaie amp to minister matter of mirth vpon this we may iustly feare the gospell is going fro vs the third sin is worldlinesse which raignes and beares sway in all places as though there were no other world and as though heauen were vpon earth the fourth sinne of our daies is lewk warmnesse for comonly man are not lost in themselues that they might be found of christ they feele not their owne pouertie they knowe not in what neede they stand of the blood of christ and therefore they make profession of the faith formally not seriously onely because they are forced so to doe by the good lawes of a good prince the last sinne is hypocrisie for all among vs come to the lord table and thereby enter into the highest degree of christianitie that can be vpon earth for thereby they make profession that they are vnited to christ and haue fellowshippe with him and grow vp therein and yet the most beeing departed from this holy sacrament take libertie to liue as they list despising all others that will not say and doe as they doe these and many others are the comon fruits of our english vineyard it stands vs all in hand to pray vnto god that he would blowe vpon his vineyard that we may bring forth better fruite and preuent the iudgements that otherwise are like to fall secondly in that god is so patient towards vs we are taught to exercise our selues in patience in respect of god when we are afflicted and corrected by him for when he laies his hand vpon vs we may not be angrie fret chafe and rage but quiet our hearts in his will though the crosse be grieuous for measure and long for continuance this patience to god ward is tearmed in scripture by an excellent name the silence of the heart wherby the heart without repining subiects it selfe to the will of god in all things psalm examine your hearts vpon your bed amp be still and be silent to iehoua thirdly if god be thus patient towards man we againe must be patient one towards another as paul saith forbeare one another and forgiue one another as god for christs sake forgaue you the faith of the mercifull patience of god cannot but breede and bring foorth in vs patience and long suffering in regard of anger and reuenge lastly in that god calls vs to saluation with great patience we must suffer our selues to be called and runne the race of our saluation with like patience we must heare the word and bring forth fruit with patience we must pray without fainting and without taking repulse as the woman of canaan did and therefore with patience our hope must be by patience and the cofort of the scriptures in a word we cannot obtaine the promises without patience the fifth and last point to be considered is what is meant by the children of hierusalem i answere it thus children in scripture are taken waies first some are children by generation of them read luke the chapter where a long genealogie is set downe from adam to christ secondly some are called children by adoption without generation michal that neuer bare child to her death is said to beare fiue to adriel because shee did adopt his children and bring them vp as her owne thirdly some are called children in regard of legall succession in title to this or that thing thus zedechias who indeed was vncle to iehoakim is said be the son of iehoakim because he did succeed iehoakim as beeing the next of the blood in the kingdome ieconias or conias was childlesse and yet he is said to beget salathiel because salathiel was to succeed him in the kingdome of iuda in that he was the next of dauids house lastly man in that they appertaine to any thing or place as children doe to their parents are called children thereof thus man are called children of light of darkenesse of sinne of wrath thus hierusalem is called the daughter of sion and in this text citizens the inhabitant of hierusalem are called the children thereof thus much of the rebellion of ierusalem now followes the punishment in these words behold your habitation shall be left vnto you desolate or thus your house that is both cittie and temple as it is in the next chapter shall be left vnto you as a wildernesse here we must first obserue that the punishmet of ierusales rebellion is a decreed desolation both of citie amp teple and the right consideration of it is of great vse for this desolation is as it were a looking glasse to this our english nation in which we may see our future condition except we repent of our vnthankefulnesse to god for his mercies and shewe better fruits of the gospell then commonly we doe the old world little regarded the ministery of nohe the preacher of righteousnes and was destroyed by an vniuersall flood it is a generall decree of god the gentiles and kingdomes that will not serue thee shall perish and be vtterly destroyed if god spare not the naturall branches he will much lesse spare vs that are but wild branches if we neglect amp lightly esteeme the gospel of life as man euery where comonly doe secondly the desolation of hierusalem may be a glasse to euery one among vs who in these daies of god mercifull visitation sets the ministerie of the gospell at naught or lightly respects it for vnlesse such persons amend and that betime vtter desolation will befall both them and their families god hath passed his sentence they that withdrawe themselues from god shall perish nowe they withdrawe themselues from god that cannot abide to haue fellowship with him in his word and to bring themselues in subiection thereto thirdly it appeares hence by the contrarie that the stabilitie of all kingdomes stands in the obedience of the gospell of christ for god kingdome is most sure and stable against which nothing can preuaile and whe the gospell is obeyed in any kingdom it is as it were founded in the kingdome of god moreouer this desolation is both perpetuall and terrible it is perpetuall that is to the last iudgement for hierusalem must be trode vnder foote till the time of the gentiles be fulfilled and that is till there be signes in the sun and moone and the powers of heauen be shaken and that is immediately before the last iudgement hence i gather that there is no cittie of hierusalem nor temple now standing it will be said that since the destruction thereof they might haue beene reedified i answer by reason of this curse of god it cannot so be three and yeres after the death of christ the iewes by the leaue and helpe of iulian the emperour went about to build again their temple and cittie but their worke was ouerthrowne and they hindred by thunder amp lightening amp earthquakes and many of them slaine thereby againe it may be said that there is a citty now standing that is called hierusale i answer it is either hierusalem in his ruines or the cittie bethara fensed and walled by elius adrianus secondly by this it appeares that the war that were made heretofore for the recouerie of the holy land and of ierusalem were in vaine this enterprize was the pollicie of the pope that he might the better seate himselfe in europe and there was little good to be looked for in the place that god had accursed with perpetuall desolation thirdly by this it appeares that pilgrimages made to the holy land are superstitious and lastly i gather hence that antichrist shall not raigne in the temple at ierusalem this is but a popish fiction for how is it possible for him to sit in a temple that is vtterly destroied in such sort that stone doth not lie vpon stone it is obiected that antichrist shall destroy the two prophets of god in the citie in vvhich christ was crucified i answer christ is as well crucified in his members as in his own person amp thus he was amp is stil crucified in rome and in respect of his members more crucified in rome then in ierusalem againe this desolation was most terrible and the tribulation thereof so great that the like was neuer since the beginning of the world history written thereof declare as much for the citie was at the first besieged by the armie of titus vespasianus called the abomination of desolation and it was withal compassed with a wall that had castles in it to command the whole citie in the time of the siege the iewes were oppressed with a grieuous famine in which their foode was olde shooes old leather old hay amp the dung of beast there died partly of the sword amp partly of the famine an eleue hundred thousand of the poorer sort two thousand in one night were imbowelled aliue sixe thousand were burned in a porch of the temple the whole citie was sacked and burnt and laid leuell to the ground and nintie seauen thousand taken captiues and to be applied to base and miserable seruice this horrible desolation must teach vs to dread and feare god and to yeeld vnfained subiection to christ and as the psalmist saith to kisse the son least he be angrie and we perish in the way when his wrath shall suddenly burne touching this desolation there be three things done by christ first he determines it saying your house shal be left vnto you desolate hence i gather that there is a prouidence of god touching things that come to passe that is one point the second is that the disposition of kingdomes for the beginning continuance and ende is of god the god of heauen saith cyrus hath giuen me all the kingdoms of the world and daniel to nabuchadnezzar the god of heauen hath giuen thee kingdome power and glorie and the handwriting vpon the wall in the sight of baltasher was to this effect thy kingdome is numbered for continuance of yeares it is waighed and found light in respect of the sinnes of the people and it is deuided to the medes amp persians this must teach all good subiects in england to lift vp their hearts to god for the continuance of peace and protection to this church and land secondly christ reueales the desolation of hierusalem and that certainely yes he determines the very particular time this generation saith he shall not passe till all these things be fulfilled and according to this reuelation amp prediction of christ al things came to passe for within the compasse of yeares after it was destroied hence i gather that this gospell of matthew and the rest are the very word of god on this manner that which foretells particular things to come certainely amp truely is of god but the gospels foretell particular things to come certainly and truely as in this place we see therefore it is of god thirdly and lastly christ labours to bring the iewes to a serious consideration of their punishment whe he saith behold for he doth as it were take the by the hand and bring them to a present view of their miserie and thus he hath alwaies dealt with his people fro the beginning yes thus he dealt with adam before his fall when he saide if thou eate the forbidden fruit in dying thou shalt die this serious consideration of deserued punishments is of great vse it is an occasion of repentance to many it is a meanes if not of repentance yet of restraint of open vices againe the consideration of euerlasting punishments is a meanes to make vs patiently beare less crosses that befall vs in this life and therefore it were to be wished that me now a daies would seriously thinke and speake of hell and of the paines thereof for then there would be more amendmet then there is but this good is hindered partly by blindnes of minde and partly by false imaginations that the iudgements and punishments of god may easily be escaped

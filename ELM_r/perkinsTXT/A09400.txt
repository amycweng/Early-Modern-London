conscience is a part of the vnderstanding in all reasonable creatures determining of their particular actions either with them or against them i say conscience is a part of the vnderstanding and i shew it thus god in framing of the soule placed in it two principall faculties vnderstanding and will vnderstanding is that facultie in the soale whereby we vse reason and it is the more principall part seruing to rule and order the whole man and therefore it is placed in the soule to be as the wagginer in the waggin the will is an other facultie whereby we doe will or nill any thing that is choose or refuse it with the will is ioyned sundrie affections as ioy sorrow loue ha ed ampc whereby we imbrace or eschew that which is good or euill now conscience is not placed in the affections nor will but in the vnderstanding because the actions thereof stand in the vse of reason vnderstanding againe hath two parts the first is that which stands in the view and contemplation of truth and falshood and goes no further the second is that which stands in the view and consideration of euery particular action to search whether it be good or badde the first is called the theorical the second the practical vnderstanding and vnder this latter is conscience to be comprehended because his propertie is to iudge of the goodnes or badnes of things or actions done againe i say that conscience is a vnderst ding hath o part properly but by analogie in respect of diverse obiects amp actions part of the minde or vnderstanding to shewe that conscience is not a bare knowledge or iudgement of the vnderstanding as th aq i p q dominic on this place ampc man commonly write but a naturall power facultie or created qualitie from whence knowledge and iudgement proceede as effects this the scriptures confirme in that they ascribe sundrie workes and actions to conscience as accusing excusing comforting terrifying which actions could not thence proceede if conscience were no more but an action or act of the minde indeede i graunt it may be taken for a certen actuall knowledge which is the effect thereof but to speake properly this knowledge must proceede of a power in the soule the propertie whereof is to take the principles and conclusions of the minde and applie the amp by applying either to accuse or excuse this is the ground of all and this i take to be conscience if it be obtected that conscience cannot be a naturall power because it may be lost i answer if conscience be lost it is onely in respect of the vse thereof as reason is lost in the drunken man and not otherwise i adde that the proper subiects of conscience are reasonable creatures that is man and angels hereby conscience is excluded first of all from beast for though they haue life amp sense amp in many things some shadows of reason yet because they want true reason they want conscience also secondly from god the creator who beeing righteousnes it selfe needeth not conscience to order amp gouerne his actions and wheras peter saith pet that man must indure griese wrongfully for conscience of god his meaning is not to shewe that god hath conscience but that man are to suffer many wrogs because their cosciences do bind the in so doing to obay god wil which conscience directly respecteth and i say that conscience is in all reasonable creatures that none might imagine that some man by nature haue conscience in them some none at all for as many man as them are so many consciences there be and euery particular man hath his owne particular conscience the proper ende of conscience is to determine of things done and by this one thing conscience is distinguished from all other gifts of the min as intelligence opinion science faith prudence intelligence simply conce thing to be or not to be science iudgeth it to be certen and sure faith is a perswasion whereby we beleeue things that are not discerneth what is meete to be done what to be left vndone but conscience goes further yet then all these for it determines or giues sentence of things done by saying vnto vs this was done this was not done this may be done this may not be done this was weldone this was ill done the things that conscience determines of are a mans owne actions his owne actions i say to be certen what an other man hath saide or done is commonly called knowledge but for a man to be certen what he himselfe hath done or saide that is conscience againe conscience meddles not with generals onely it deales in particular actions and that not in some fewe but in all the manner of consciences determination is to set downe his iudgement either with the creature or against it i adde this clause because conscience is of a diuine nature and is a thing placed by god in the middest betweene him and man as an arbitratour to giue sentence and to pronounce either with man or against man vnto god for otherwhiles it consents and speakes with god against the man in whome it is placed other whiles againe it consents with him and speakes for him before the lord and hence comes one reason of the name of conscience scire to know is of one man alone by himselfe and conscire is when two at the least know some one secret thing either of them knowing it togither with the other therefore the name or conscientia conscience is that thing that combines two togither and makes them partners in the knowledge of one and the same secret now man and man o man and angel can not be combined because they can not know the secret of any man vnlesse it be reucaled to them it remaines therefore that this combination is onely betweene man and god god knowes perfectly all the doings of man though they be neuer so hid and concealed and man by a gift giue him of god knows togither with god the same things of himselfe and this gift is named conscience the proper actions or duties of conscience are twofold to giue testimonie or to giue iudgement rom conscience giues testimonie by determining that a thing was done or it was not done rom their conscience also bearing witnes corinthian our reioycing is the testimonie of our conscience that in ampc here we must consider three things i of what things conscience beares witnes ii in what manner iii how long for the first conscience beares witnesse of our thoughts of our affections of our outward actions that it beares witnes of our secret thoughts it appeares by the solemne protestation which at some time man vse in my conscience i never thought it whereby they signifie that they think something or they thinke it not and that their consciences can tell what they thinke neither must this seeme strange for there must be two actions of the vnderstanding the one is simple which barely conceiueth or thinketh this or that the other is a reflecting or doubling of the former whereby a man conceiues and thinkes with himselfe what he thinks and this action properly pertaines to the conscience the minde thinks a thought now conscience goes beyond the minde and knowes what the minde thinks so as if a man would go about to hide his sinnefull thoughts from god his conscience as an other person within him shall discouer all by meanes of this second action conscience may beare witnes euen of thoughts and from hence also it seemes to borrow his name because conscience is a science or knowledge ioyned with an other knowledge for by it i conceiue and know what i know againe conscience beares witnes what the wills and affections of man be in euery matter rom i say the truth in christ i lie nos my conscience bearing me witnes in the holy ghost that i haue great ea ines and continuall sorrow in my heart for i could wish my selfe to be separate from christ for my brother lastly it witnesseth what be mens actions ecclesiastes oftentimes also thine heart knoweth that is consciece witnesseth that thou likewise hast cursed others the manner that conscience vseth in giuing testimonie standes in two things first it obserues and takes notice of all things that we doe secondly it doth inwardly and secretly within the heart tell vs of them all in this respect it may fitly be compared to a notarie or a register that hath alwaies the penne in his hand to note and record whatsoeuer is saide or done who also because he keepes the rolles and records of the court can tell what hath bin said and done many hundred yeares past touching the third point how long conscience beares witnes it doth it continually not for a minut or a day or a moneth or a yeare but for euer when a man dies conscience dieth not when the bodie is rotting in the graue conscience liueth and is safe and sound and when we shall rise againe conscience shall come with vs to the barre of god iudgement either to accuse or excuse vs before god rom their conscience bearing witnes at the day when god shall iudge the secrets of man by iesus christ by this first dutie of conscience we are to learne three things the first that there is a god and we may be lead to the sight of this euen by very reason for conscience beares witnesse of what of thy particular doings but against whome or with whome doth it giue testimonie thou maist feele in thy heart that it doth it either with thee or against thee and to whom is it a witnesse to man or angels that can not be for they can not heare the voice of conscience they can not receiue consciences testimony nay they can not see what is in the heart of man it remaines therefore that there is a spirituall substance most wise most holy most mighty that sees a i things to whom conscience beares record and that is god himselfe let atheists barke against this as long as they will they haue that in them which will convince them of the truth of the godhead will they nill they either in life or death secondly we learne that god doth watch ouer all man by a speciall prouidence the master of a prison is knowen by this to haue care ouer his prisoners if hee send keepers with them to watch them and to bring them home againe in time convenient and so god care to man is manifest in this that when he created man and placed him in the worlde he gaue him conscience to be his keeper to follow him alwaies at the heeles amp to dogge him as we say amp to pry into his actions amp to beare witnesse of them all thirdly hence we may obserue god goodnesse and loue to man if he do any thing amisse he sets his conscience first of all to tell him of it sec edy if then he amende god forgives it if not then afterward conscience must openly accuse him for it at the barre of god iudgement before all the saints and angels in heauen the second worke of conscience is to giue iudgement of things done to giue iudgemet is to determine that a thing is well done or ill done herein conscience is like to a iudge that holdeth an assize and takes notice of inditements and causeth the most notorious malefactour that is to hold up his hand at the barre of his iudgement nay it is as it were a little god sitting in the middle of mens hearts arraigning them in this life as they shall be arraigned for their offences at the tribunall seate of the euerliuing god in the day of iudgement wherfore the temporary iudgement that is giuen by the conscience is nothing els but a beginning or a fore unner of the last iudgement hence we are admonished to take special heed that nothing past lie heavy upon vs amp that we charge not our cosciences in time to come with any matter for if our conscience accuse us god will much more condemne vs saith s john io because he seeth all our actions more clearely and iudgeth them more seuerely then conscience can it shall be good therfore for all man to labour that they may say with paul corinthian i knovv nothing by my selfe that they ay stand before god without blame for euer h st we must consider two things first the c se that makes conscience giue iudgement secondly the manner how the c use is the binder of the conscience the binder is that thing whatsoeuer which hath power amp authority ouer conscience to order it to bind is to vrge cause and constraine it in euery action either to accuse for sinne or to excuse for well doing or to say this may be done or it may not be done conscience is said to be bound as it is considered a part by it selfe from the binding power of god comandement for then it hath liberty amp is not bound either to accuse or excuse but is apt to do either of them indifferently but when the binding power is set once ouer the cosciece the in euery actio it must needs either accuse or excuse eue as a man in a city or town hauing his liberty may go vp amp down or not go where amp when he will but if his body be attached by the magistrate amp imprisoned the his former liberty is restrained amp he can go up and downe but within the prison or some other allowed place the binder of conscience is either proper or improper proper is that thing which hath absolute and soueraigne power in it selfe to bind the conscience and that is the worde of god writte in the books of the old amp new testame reason i he which is the lord of by his word and lawes bindes con but god is the only lorde of conscience bec se he once created it and he alone gouer none but he knowes it therfore his word and lawes only bind conscience properly ii which hath power to s e or destroy the for the keeping or breaking of his lawes ath absolute power to bind the soul and cons ence by the same lawes but the first is true of god alone iam there is lawgiver which is able to save and destroy isa the lorde is our iudge the lord is our lavvginer the lorde is our king and he will save vs therefore the worde of god alone by an absolute and soueraigne power binds conscience because this point is cleare of it selfe further proofe is needlesse hece we are taught sundry points of instruction i such as are ignorat amog us must labor to get knowledge of god worde because it binds coscience neither wil the plea of ignora e serue for excuse because whether we know god laws or know them not they stil bind us and we are bound not only to do them but whe we know them not we are further bound not to be ignorant of them but to seeke to know them if we had no more sinnes our ignorance were sufficient to condemne vs ii god word is to be obeyed though we should offend all man yes loose all mens fauour and suffer the greatest domage that may be euen the losse of our liues and the reason is at hand because god worde hath this prerogatiue to bridle bind amp restraine the conscience iii whatsoeuer we enter se or take in hand we must first search whether god giue vs liberty in conscience and warra to do it for if we do otherwise conscience bo nd presently to charge vs of sinne before god lastly we do here see how dangerous the case is of all time seruers that will liue as they list and be of no certen religion till differences and dissentions therein be ended and they haue the determination of a generall counsell for whether these things come to passe or no certen i is that they are bound in conscience to receiue and beleeue the ancient propheticall and apostolicall doctrine touching the true worship of god and the way to euerlasting which is the true religion the same is to be said of all drowsie protestant and lukewarme gospellers that use religion not with that care and conscience they ought but only then and so far forth as it serues for their turnes commonly neglecting or despising the assemblies where the word is preached and seldome frequenting the lord table vnles it be at easter like silly wretches they neither see nor feele the constraining power that god word hath in their cosciences god word is either law or gospel the law is a part of god word of things to be done o to be left vndone and it is threefold morall iudiciall ceremoniall morall law concernes duties of loue partly to god amp partly towards our neighbour t is contained in the decalogue or commandements amp it is the very law of nature written in all man heart for substance though not for the m ner of propounding of it in the creation of man amp therfore it binds the consciences of all man at all times euen of blind and ignorant persons that neither knowe the most of it nor care to know it yet here must be remembred exceptions or cautions i when two commandements of the morall law are opposite in respect of v so as we can not do them both at the same time then the less commandement giues place to the greater amp doth not bind for that instant example i god commands one thing amp the magistrate commaunds the flat contrary in this case which of these two commandements must be obeyed honour god or c honour the magistrate the answer is that the latter must giue place to the former amp the former must only be obeyed act whether it be right in the sight of god to obey you rather the god judge ye ii the commandement prescribes rest on the sabbath day now it out that at the same time a whole tow set on fire and the sixt commandement requires our help in sauing our neighbours life amp goods now of these two comandements which must be obeyed for both can not the answer is that the fourth commandement at this time is to giue place amp the sixt commandement alone binds the conscience so as then if need should require a man might labour all the day without offence to god matthew i will have mercie amp not sacrifice and the rule must not be omitted that charity towards our neighbour is subordinate to the loue of god amp therfore must giue place to it for this cause the commandement concerning charity must giue place to the comandement cocerning loue to god amp when the case so fals out that we must either offend our neighbour or god we must rather offend our neighbour then god ii caution when god giues some particular comandement to his people dispensing with some other comandement of the moral law for that time it binds not for all the comandements must be coceiued with this conditio except god comand otherwise exaple i the sixt commandement is thou shalt not kill but god giues a particular commandemet to abraham abraha offer thy son isaac in sacrifice to me and this latter comandement at that instant did bind abraham amp he is therefore commended for his obedience to it ii and when god commanded the children of israel to compasse ierico seuen daies and therfore on the sabbath the fourth commandement prescribing the sanctifying of rest on the sabbath for th instant and in that action did not bind conscience iii caution one and the same commandement in some things binds the conscience more straitly and in doing some other things lesse doe good to all man but sp them that be of the houshold of faith hence it ariseth that though all sinnes be mortall and deserue eternall death yet all are not equall but some more grieuous then others iudiciall lawes of moses are all such as prescribe order for the execution of iustice and iudgement in the common wealth they were specially given by god amp directed to the iewes who for this very cause were bound conscience to keepe them all and if the common wealth of the iewes were now standing in the old estate no doubt they should continue still to bind as before but uching other nation and specially christian common wealths in these d es the case is otherwise some are of opinion that the whole iudiciall law is wholly abolished and some againe runne to the other extreme holding that iudiciall lawes binde christians as straightly as iewes but no doubt they are both wide and the safest course is to keepe the meane betweene both therefore the iudiciall lawes of moses according to the substance and scope thereof must be distinguished in which respects they iuris particul are of two sorts some of them are lawes of particular equity some of i is common equity lawes of particular equity are such as prescribe iustice according to the particular estate and condition of the iewes common wealth amp to the circumstances therof time place persons things actions of this kind was the law brother should rais vp seed to his brother and many such like amp none of them bind vs because they were framed and pered to a particular people i als of common equity are such as are made according to the law or instinct of nature common to all man and these in respect of their nce binde the consciences not onely of the iewes but also of the gentiles for they were not giuen to the iewes as they are iewes that is a people receiued into the aboue all other nation brought from egypt to the land of canaan of whome the messias according to the flesh was to co but they were giuen to them as they were mortall man subiect to the order and la s of nature as all other nation are againe iudiciall la so farre forth as they haue in them the generall or common equity of the lawe of nature are morall and therfore binding in con the morall law a iudiciall law may be knowen to be a law of common equity if either of these two things be found in it first if wise man not onely among the iewes but also in other nation haue by naturall reason and conscience iudged the same to be equall iust and necessary and withall haue testified this their iudgement by inacting lawes for their common wealthes the same in substance with sundry of the iudiciall lawes giuen to the iewes and the roman emperours among the rest haue done this most excellently as will appeare by conferring their lawes with the lawes of god secondly a iudiciall hath common equitie if it serue directly to explane and confirme any of the tenne precepts of the decalogue or if is se directly to maintaine and vphold any of the three estates of the family the common wealth the church and whether this be so or no it will appeare if we doe but consider the matter of the lawe and the reasons or considerations vpon which the lord was mooued to giue the fame unto the iewes now to make the point in hand more plaine take an example or two it is a iudiciall law of god that murderers must be put to death now the question is whether this law for substance be the common equity of nature binding consciences of christians or not and the answer is that without further doubting it is so for first of all this law hath bin by common consent of wise lawgiuers enacted in many country and kingdomes beside the iewes it was the lawe of the egyptians and ip i h olde grecians of draco of numa and of many of the romane t d of amp a lib c de episc emperours secondly this lawe serues directly to maintaine obedience to the sint commandement and the consideration upon which the law was made is so weighty that without it a common wealth can not stand the murderers bloode must be shedde saieth the lorde numb v because the whole lande is defiled with blood and remaineth vn d till his blood be shed againe it was a iudiciall law among the iewes that the adulterer amp adulteresse should die the death now let the question be whether this law concerne other ns as being deriued from the common law of nature and it seemes to be so for first wise man by the light of reason and naturall conscience haue iudged this punishment equall and iust iudah before this iudiciall law was giuen by moses appointed tamar his daughter in law to be rnt to death for playing the whore nabuchadnezzar burnt echa and zedechias because they committed adultery with their neighbours wiues by dracoes law among the grecians this sinne was death and also by the law of the romanes againe this law seemes directly to maintaine necessary obedience to the seuenth commandement and the considerations upon which this law was giuen are perpetual amp serue to vphold the common wealth lev yee saith the lord shall keep all mine or dinances amp my iudgements the law of adultery being o of them now marke the reasons the land you out for the same sun i have ab borred the nation the ce oniall law is that which prescribes rites amp orders in the outward worship of god it must be cosidered in three times the first is time before the comming death of christ the second the time of publishing the by the apostles the third the time after the publishing of the gospell in the first it did bind the consciences of the iewes amp the obedience of it was the true worship of god but it did not th bind the consciences of the gentils for it was the partition wall betwene them and es and it did continue to bind the ll the very death and ascension of c for the hand writing of ordinances was against vs was nailed on the crosse cancelled and when christ saith that the and the indured till ohn luke meaning is not that the ceremoniall law ended then but that things foretold by the prophets and ob ly prefigured by the law began then more plainly to be preached and made manifest the second time was from the ascension of christ till about the time of the destruction of the temple and city in which ceremonies ceased to bind conscience and remained indifferent hereupon paul circumcised timothy the apostles after christs ascension as occasion was offered were present in the emple act and the councill of hierusalem tendering the weakenesse of some beleeuers decreed that the church for a time should abstaine fro strangled amp blood and there was good reason of this because the church of the iewes was not yet sufficiently conuicted that an end was put to the ceremoniall law by the death of christ in the third time which was after the publishing of the gospell ceremonies of the iewes church became unlawful and so shall continue to the worlds end by this it appeares what a monstrous and miserable religion the church of rome teacheth and maintaines which standes wholy in ceremonies partly heat heathenish and partly iewish as for the gospel i take it for that part of the word of god which promiseth righteousnesse and life euerlasting to all that beleeue in christ and withall commandeth this faith that we may the better know how the gospell binds conscience two points must be considered one touching the persons bound the other touching the manner of binding persons are of two sorts some be called some be uncalled persons called are all such to whom god in mercy hath offered the meanes of saluation and hath reuealed the doctrine of the gospell in some measure more or lesse by meanes either ordinary or extraordinary all such i thinke are straightly bounde in conscience to beleeue and obey the gospell for that word of god whereby man shall be iudged in the day of iudgement must first of all binde their consciences in this life considering absolution and condemnation is according to that which is done in this life but by the gospell all man that haue beene called shall be iudged as paul saith roman god shall iudge the secrets of man by iesus christ according to my gospell and our sauiour christ saieth hee that beleeveth hath life everlasting hee vvhich beleeveth not is alreadie condemned it remaines therfore that the gospell binds the consciences of such man in this life by this wee are all put in minde not to content our selues with this that wee haue a liking to the gospell and doe beleeue it to be true though many protestant in those our dayes thinke it sufficient oth in life and death if they holde that they are to be saved by faith alone in christ without the merite of mans workes but wee must goe yet further and enter into a practise of the doctrine of the gospell as well as of the precepts of the morall lawe knowing that the gospell doeth as well binde conscience as the lawe and if it be not obeyed will as well condemne man vncalled are such as neuer hearde of christ by reason the gospell was neuer reuealed unto them nor means of reuelatio offered that there haue bene such in former ages i make it manifest thus the worlde since the creation may be distinguished into foure ages the first from the creation to the floode the second from the flood to the giuing of the lawe the third from the giuing of the law to the death of christ the fourth from the death of christ to the last iudgement now in the three former ages there was a distinction of the world into two so es of man whereof one was a people of god the other o people in the first age in the families of seth noe ampc were the sonnes of god in all other families the sonnes of man genes in the second age were the sonnes of the flesh and the sonnes of the promise roman in the thirde iewes and g the iewes being the church of god all nation b no church but the last age this distinction was taken a the apostles had a comission giuen them that was neuer giuen before to any namely to goe teach not only the iewes but all nation now this distinction arose of this that the gospell was not revealed to the worlde before the co ing of christ as the scriptures wi es the prophet isaiah saith that kings s their at christ because that which ad not b ld they shal see amp that which they d l they vnderstad and that a natio that knew him not shall runne vnto him paul saith of the ephesians that in former times they were without god and without christ strangers from the venant ephesians and to the atheni s he saith the times before the co ing of christ were times of ignorance act and that it may not be thought that this ignorance was affected paul aith further that god in ti e past suffered the gentiles to walke in their act and that th myster e of the gospel was kept secret from the beginning of the world d s now in the last age r led to the whole world rom some alleadge that the iewes beeing the church of god had tr cke with all nation and by this meanes sp d some little knowledge of the messia thorough the whole world i answer againe that the conference and speach of iewish marchants with forrainers was no sufficient means to publish the promise of saluation by christ to the whole world first because the iewes for the most part haue alwaies bin more readie to receiue y new and false religion then to teach their owne secondly because the very iewes thems though they were well acquainted with the es of their religion yet the s stance thereof which was christ figured by ex ll ceremonies they knew not and hereupon the pharisies when they made a prosolyte they made him ten times more the childe of the d ll then themselues thirdly because man are ome or neuer suffered to professe or make any speach of their religion in foreign country againe if it b alleadged that the doctrine of the gospel is set downe in the books of the old testament which man through the whole world might haue read searched and knowne if they would i answer that the keeping of the bookes of the old testament was committed to the iewes alone rom and therefore they were not giuen to the whole world as also the psalmist testifieth h s th his word vnto iacob his statutes and his iudgements vnto isra l he hath not dealt so with euery nation neither haue they k his iudgements psalm now touching such persons as haue not so much as heard of christ though they are apt amp fit to be bound in conscience by the gospel in as much as they are the creatures of god yet are they not indeede actually bound till such time as the gospel be reuealed or at the least of reuelation offered reasons herof may be these i whatsoeuer doctrine or law doth conscience must in some part be know by or by grace or by both the vnderstanding must first of all conceiue or at the least haue meanes of conc ing before conscience can constraine because it b deth by vertue of knowne con in the minde therefore things that are altogether vnknowne and vnconceiued of the vnderstanding doe not binde in conscience now the gospel is altogether vnknowne and vn d of many as i haue alreadie prooued and therefore it binds not them in conscience ii paul saith rom they vvhich s e vvithout the law written shall be condened without the law therefore they which sinne without the gospel shall be condemned without the gospel and such as shall be condemned without the gospel after this life were not bound by it in this life augustine the most iudiciall div of all the ent f hers vpon these words of christ but now they of their saith on this manner a doubt may be d vvhether they to whome christ hath not co neither hath spoken vnto them a excuse for their s e for if they have n t vvhy is it said that these namely the iewes excuse because he came amp sp ke to th and if they haue it whether it be that their p t may be taken a y quite or in part l d to these dem des according to my capaciti as the lord i me i answer that they to whome c not neither hath spoken vnto them not of euery s e but of this y have not beleeued in christ againe to inquire whether those who before christ in his church to the til eard his gospel haue bi death may vse this excuse d but they shall not therefore es whosoeuer haue s ed without th perish without the law as for the reasons which some of the schoolmen haue alleadged to the contra they are answered all by t article man of the same order and i will briefly touch the principall first i obiected that the holy ghost shall iudge the worl of because they haue bele ved in christ ioh i answer that by the world we must not vnderstand and y man s e the creation but all nation and kingdomes in the last age of the world to whome the gospel was ed thus hath paul expounded this word rom the fall of them is the riches of the world and the diminishing of them the riches of the gentiles v the casting of them away is the reconciling of the world secondly it is obiected that the law binds all man in conscience though the greatest part of it e vnknowne to them ans the low was once giuen to adam and imprinted in his heart his first creation and in him as b ing the roote of all mankin it was giuen to all man and as when he ed man ed in him so when he was inlighte d all were inlightened in him and cosequently when his conscience was bound by the l w all were bound in him and though this knowledge be lost by mans default yet the bond r s still on god part nowe the case i otherwise with the gospel which was neuer written in mans nature but was g n after the fall and is aboue nature here a further reply is made that the covenant made with adam the seede of the shall br se the serpe s ead was also made with his seede which is all mankinde and was afterward con d with abraham to all nation i answer againe that adam was a o e of mankinde onely in respect of mens with the gifts and thereo was no root in respect of grace which is aboue nature but christ the second adam and therefore when god gaue the promise vnto him and faith to beleeue the promise he did not in him giue both to all mankind neither if adam had afterward fallen fro faith in the m should all inde agai f grace w o ad it appeares b se god did the cov t b to the of n and abr it w res ed to isaac isaac saith the lord hy s be yes in the very of the is a distinction made of the se d of the w m n and the se of the serpe which eed of the erpent is a io part of mankind it ex ded from the covena t and wher the promised to abraham that in his eede all ions of the earth should be blessed the ise must not be vnderstood of all man in e but of all tion in the last age of the and thus p ath cleared there the scripture fore se ing that god vv ld iusti the ge tiles thr gh aith which was done after christs pre hed before the spel to a t shall be blessed lastly it may be obiected if any man be ignorant of the doctrine of tion by christ it is throug his owne fault it is true indeede that all ig ce of the doctrine of salvation com h mans fault and sinne but sinne must be istinguished it is either perso o the of mans nature now in them that heard of christ i this point proceedes not of personall in them but ly from the of nature i the e of to kind which is punished when god to th now many things there be man proceeding from this s which are no sinnes as the m nifold miseries of this li amp so i take the ignorance of things aboue ma nature altogether vn ealed to be no inne a punishment of originall sinne thus much f the persons which are bound by the go now how farre they are d by god in the gospel g lly two points vnto the first that there is perfect igh ousnes and life o christ the second that the to obtaine righteousnes and life christ moreouer when this gospel dispe sed and preached vnto vs god les vnto vs two points more the first ee make vs particularly to be partakers of true righteousnesse and life euerlasting by c the second that hee will haue vs with doubting to beleeue thus much of our s nd for this cause euery man to he is led i bound to beleeue his no d tion iustification sanctification and glori cation in and by christ the reasons and this point out of the w d of god re th io this is his that we beleeue i the name of his s e s christ and lo e as e ga e vs c ment now to beleeue in christ is not con sedly to beleeue that he is a redeemer of mankind but withall to beleeue that he is my iour and that i am elected iustified sanctified and shalbe glorified by him this is graunted of all then yes of the papists themselues which otherwise are f this doctrine for berd saith to belee e i go is by beleeuing to lo e d i re to g into god by belee ing to cl vnto him and as it were to be into his bers ii paul gal first of all propounds a generall sentence that a is iustified by the workes of the law by the faith of christ afterwa d he addes a speciall application e en we namely iowes beleeued in iesus christ that vve might be iustified by the faith of iesus christ and in v he descends more specially to apply the gospel to himselfe i liue saith he by the faith of the son of god who hath loued and himselfe for me and in this kinde of application there is nothing peculiar to paul for in this very action of his he is an example vnto vs tim f this cause saith he was i receiued to that iesus christ should she first all lo g ffering vnto the e sample of the which shall in time to c e belee e in im to ter ll life againe philip he saith i thinke allthings but losse that i might winne christ and might be fo n in him not having mi e vv e righteousnes but that vvhich is through the faith of christ that i may knovv him the v of his resurrection and af erward he ddeth v l t vs as many as be perfect be mi ed iii whatsoeuer we pray for according to god will we are bound to beleeue that it shall be giuen vnto vs mark whatsoeuer ye des when ye pray belee that y shall haue i and it shall be done vnto you but we pray for the pardon of our owne sinnes and for life euerlasting by christ and that according to the will of god therefore we are bound in conscience to beleeue the p don of our owne sinnes and life euerlasting iv if god should speake particularly to any man and say vnto him cornelius or peter beleeue thou in christ and thou shalt be saued this commaundem should binde him particularly now when the minister lawfully called in the name and stead of god publisheth the gospel to the congregation that is as much as if god himselfe had spoken to them particularly calling each of them by their names and promising vnto them life euerlasting in christ corinthian we as ambassadours for christ as though god did be seech you through vs pray you in christs stead that ye be re ciled to god it may be and is obiected that if euery man be bound in conscience to beleeue his owne election and saluation by christ then some man are bound to beleeue that which is false because some there be euen in the middest of the church which in the counsell of god were neuer chosen to saluation i answeare that this reason were good if man were bound absolutely to beleeue their saluation without further respect or condition but the bond is conditionall according to the tenour of the couenant of grace for we are bound to beleeue in christ if we would come to life euerlasting or if we would be in the uour of god or if we would be good disciples and members of christ in that we are bound in conscience on this manner to beleeue the promises of the gospell with an application of the benefites thereof to our selues sundrie necessarie and profitable points of instruction may be learned the first that the popish doctours abolish a great part of the gospel when they teach that man are bound to beleeue the gospel onely by a catholicke saith which they make to be nothing else but a gift of god or illumination of the minde whereby assent is giuen to the word of god that it is true and more specially that iesus is christ that is an all sufficient sauiour of mankinde all which the damned spirits beleeue whereas the gospel for the comfort and saluation of mens soules hath a further reach namely to inioyne man to beleeue that the promise of saluation is not onely true in it selfe but also true in the very person of the beleeuer as appeares euidently by the sacraments which are as it were a visible gospel in which christ with all his benefits is offered and applied to the particular persons of man to this ende no doubt that they might beleeue the accomplishment of the promise in themselues secondly we learne that it is not presumption for any man to beleeue the remission of his owne sinnes for to doe the will of god to which we are bound is not to presume now it is the will of god to which he hath bound vs in conscience to belo ue the remi ion of our owne sinnes and therefore rather to doe it is p ous disobedience thirdly we are here to rke and to re ber with care the foundation of the certen e of mans salo ion for if man be bound in conscience first to giue assent to the gosp t and secondly to applie to himselfe by true faith then without doubt a man by faith may be certenly perswaded of his owne and saluation in this without any ext ordinarie reuelation god commaundements beeing in this and the like case possible for commaundements are either legall or evangelical legall shew vs t disease but giue vs no remedie and the perfect doing of them according to the intent of the law giuer by reason of mans weaknes and through mans default is impossible in this world as for evangelical commandements they haue this priuiledge that they may and can be performed according to the intention of the lawgiuer in this life because with the commandement is ioyned the inward operation of the spirit to inable vs to effect the dutie commaunded and the will of god is not to require absolute perfection at our hands in the gospel as in the law but rather to qualifie the rigour of the law by the satisfaction of a mediatour in our steads and of vs we beeing in christ to accept the vpright will and indeauour for the deede as the will to repent and the will to beleeue for repentance and true faith indeede now then if things required in the gospel be both ordinarie and possible then for a man to haue an unfallible certaintie of his owne saluation is both ordinary amp possible but more of this point afterward lastly all such persons as are troubled with distrustings vnbeleefe dispaire of god mercie are to learne and consider that god by his word bindes them in conscience to be ue the pardon of their owne sinnes be they neuer so grieuous or many and to be e their own election to saluation whereof they doubt m hat are but civill haue care to auoid robbing and killing because god giues commaundements against stealing and killing why then should not we much more striue against our manifold doubtings and distrustings of god loue in christ hauing a commandement of god that calls vpon vs and binds vs to doe so thus we see how god word bindes consciences now conscience being thus bound againe bindes vs the bonde of conscience is called guiltines guiltines is nothing els but a worke of the conscience binding ouer a man to a punishment before god for some sinne thus much of the propet binder of the conscience now follows the improper the improper binder is that which hath no power or vertue in it selfe to binde conscience but doth it onely by vertue of god word or of some part of it it is threefold humane lawes an oath a promise touching humane lawes the speciall point to be considered is in what manner they binde that this may in part be cleared i will stande a while to examine and confute the opinion that the very pillers of the popish church at this day maintaine namely that civill and ecclesi sticall iuris ction haue a coactive povver in the conscience and that the made thereby doe as truly and properly binde as they speake to mortall and venial sinne as god law it selfe the arguments which they commonly vse are these argum deut that man that vvill presumptuous y and not ob y the imperis au horitie of the priest or i dge shall and th shalt take away euill from israel here say they the precepts of the high priest are princely commandements imperia not dmonitions or exhortations and they binde in conscience otherwise the transgressours thereof should not haue bin punished so seuerely answer the intent of this law as a very child may perceiu is to establish the authoriue and right of the highest appeales for all matters of controversie in the synedrium o great court at ierusa lem therefore the words alleadged doe not giue vnto the priest a soveraigne power of making lawes but a power of giuing iudgement of controuersies and that according to lawes alreadie made by god himselfe from which iudgement there might be no appeale nowe this power of determining doth not constraine conscience but the outward man to maintaine order and peace for what reason is there that that sentence which might be either a gainsaying of god law or a mistaking of it should binde the conscience to a sinne againe not euery one that refused to subiect themselues to the sentence of this court were straightway guiltie of sinne for this did ieremie the prophet and christ our sauiour when they were condemned for wicked persons but he that presumptuously despised the sentence and by consequent the authoritie it selfe which was the ordinence of god was guiltie lastly the seueritie of the punishment which is temporall death doth not argue any power in the iudge of binding conscience this they might haue learned of their owne d ct who holdeth that they that binde any man to mortall sinne m st be able to punish him with answe rable punishment which is eternall death argum math what soeuer ye shall bind vpon shall be in heauen here to binde is to make lawes ning conscience according to matth they binde bur ns and lay the mens ansvver the power of binding and soo is not belonging to any creature but is p op to christ who hath the keyes of heauen and hell he openeth and no man sh h d no man openeth r as for the power of the church it is nothing but ministerie of seruice whereby man publish and pro that christ bindeth or ido eth againe this binding stands not in the power of making lawes but in remitting and retaining of m ns sinnes as the words going before declate v if thy brother sinne against thee amp and christ eweth h owne meaning when he ith whose sinnes ye remit they are remitted and hose sinnes retaine they are retained ioh before in the person of peter promised them this honour in this forme of words math i vvillgiue vnto thee the keyes of the king dome of e what soeuer th shalt binde vpon earth sh be bo in e this which i say is approoued by consent of auncient divines august psalm ser remission of s saith he is loosing therefore by the law of contraries binding is to hold sinne vnpardoned hilar vpon math cap whome they binde on earth that is saith he leaue vntied of the knots of their s nes lumberd the popish master of sentences the lord saith he hath given to priests power of binding and loosing that is of making manifest that man are bound or loosed againe both origin on mat augustine and theophilact attribute the power of biuding to all christians and therefore they for their partes neuer dreamed that the power of binding should be an authority to make lawes lastly the place matthew overturnes the argument for there the scribes and phanses are condemned because they laid upon mens shoulders the burdens of their traditions as meanes of god worship and things binding conscience arg act it seemes good vnto vs amp the holy ghost to lay no more burden on you the these necessary things that yee abstaine from things offered to i ols and blood and that which is strangled and fo nication here say they the apostles by the instinct of the holy ghost make a new lawe not for this or that respect but simply to binde consciences of the gentils that they might be exercised in obedience and this is prooued because the apostles call this lawe a burden and call the things prescribed necessary and s luke tearmes them the commandements of the apostles and chrysostom calls the epistle sent to the church imperium that is a lordly charge to this they adde the testimonies of tertullian origin augustine answer though all be granted that the law is a burden imposed a precept of the apostles a charge againe that things required therein are necessary yet will it not follow by good consequent that the lawe simply bindes conscience because it was giuen with a reseruation of christian libertie so as out of the case of scandall that is if no offence were giuen to the weake iewes it might freely be omitted and that will appeare by these reasons first of all peter saith that it is a tempting of god to impose upon the gentiles the yoke of iewish ceremonies hee therefore must needs be contrary to himselfe if he intend to binde mens consciences to abstinence from strangled blood and things offered to idols a reply is made that this abstinence is prescribed not by the ancient law of moses but by a new ecclesiasticall or apostolicall authority i answer againe that a mosaicall ceremony is still the same thing though it be stablished by a new authority and wheras christ by his death put an end to the ceremoniall lawe it is absurde to thinke that the apostles by their authority revived some part of it againe and bound mens consciences therto secondly the church of god in all places suffered this comandement to cease which the faithful servant of god would neuer haue done if they had bin perswaded that this law had bound conscience simply it is answered that this law ceased not because the giuing of offence unto the iewes ceased but because it ceased vniuersally yes but it could not haue ceased universally if it had bound conscience simply specially considering it was propounded to the church without any mention or limitation of time thirdly paul was present in this counsell and knewe the intent of this lawe very well amp therefore no doubt he did not in any of his epistles gainsay the same this being graunted it can not be that this law should bind conscience out of the case of offence for he teacheth the corinthians that things offered to idols may be eaten so be it the weake brother be not offended here it is answered that when paul writ his first epistle to the corinthians this comandement of the apostles touching things strangled amp bloode was not come unto them well to grant all this which can not be prooued let it be answered why paul did not now deliuer it amp why he deliuereth doctrine contrary to that which he had hierusalem which was that the gentiles should absolutely abstaine from things o d to idols as for the testimonies of the fathers they bused indeed t li plainly that christians in his daies abstained of blood and he persvvades man to so doing because he is of opinion being indeed farre deceiued that this very law of the apostles must l st to the end of the worlde which conceit if the papists hold not what meane they to build vpon him origin saith that this law was very necessary in his daies and no for by idolithy s he understands not things that haue bene offered to idols amp are afterward brought to priuat houses or to the market as other common meates but he understands things that remaine consecrated to idols amp are no where els used but in their temples which we grant with him must for euer be avoided a meanes and instruments of idolatry wheras the law of the apostlesspeaks only of the first kind as for things strangled and blood hee takes them to be the devil foode and for this cause hee approoues abstinence from them and whereas augustine saith that it is a good thing to abstain fro things offered to idols though he be in necessity must be understoode of the first kind of idolithy which re yet remaining in the idoltemples still consecrated unto them and not of the second of which the apostles law as i haue said must be understood arg ioh christ saith to peter my that is as the word importeth and rule my sheepe answer this feeding and ruling stands not in making new lawes but in teaching and gouerning the church of god according to the doctrine which they had receiued from christ and this action of feeding is ascribed to all christians revelat who can not therupon chalenge a power of making lawes to the conscience argum ioh as my father sent me so i send you but christ was sent of his father not only with power of preaching and ministring the sacraments but also with authority of commanding and giuing iudgement answer is this kind of reasoning may stand all the apostles shall be made redeemers for they were all sent as christ was and hee was sent not onely to preach the redemption of mankind but also to effect and worke the same it this be absurde then it is a flat abusing of scripture to gather fro this saying of christ that the apostles had power of binding conscience because he had so it is true indeed that there is a similitude or analogie betwene the calling of christ and his apostles but it wholly stands in these points christ was ordained to his office before all worldes amp so were the apostles christ was called of his father immediatly and so were they of christ christ was sent to the whol worlde amp so were they christ receiued all power in heaven and earth as beeing necessary for a mediatour and they receiued an extraordinary authority from him with such a plentifull measure of the spirit as was necessary for the apostolicall function lastly christ was sent euen as he was man to be a teacher of the iewes amp therfore be is called the minister of circumcision rom amp so the apostles are sent by him to teach the gentiles thus far is the comparison to be enlarged amp no further and that no man might imagine that some parte of this resemblance stands in a power of binding conscience christ hath put a speciall exception when he saith goe teach all nation teaching them to obserue al things that i have commanded you arg rom whosoever resisteth the power resisteth the ordinance of god and they that resist all receive to them selues iudgement and ye must be subiect not onely for wrath but also for conscience s e answer magistracie indeed is an ordinance of god to which we owe subiectio but how farre subiection is due there is the questio for body amp goods amp outward coversation i grant all but a subiection of coscience to mans lawes i deny and betweene these two there is a great difference to be subiect to authority in conscience amp to be subiect to it for conscience as wil be manifest if we do but consider the phrase of the apostle the meaning whereof is that we must performe obedience not onely for anger that is for the auoiding of punishment but also for the auoiding of sinne amp so by cosequent for auoiding a breach in cosciece now this breach is not properly made because mans law is neglected but because god law is broken which ordaineth magistracie amp withall binds mens consciences to obey their lawful commandements and the danation that is due unto man for resisting the ordinance of god comes not by the single breach of magistrates commandemet but by a transgression of the law of god which appointeth magistrates amp their authority to this answer papists reply nothing that is of moment therfore i proceed arg corinthian what will you that i come unto you with a rod or in the spirit of meeknes now this rod is a iudicial power of punishing sinners answer for the regiment amp protection of god church there be rods m oned in scripture the rod of christ amp the apostolicall rodd the rod of christ is termed a rod of iron or the rod of his mouth amp it signifies that absolute amp soueraigne power which christ hath ouer his creatures wherby he is able to couert amp saue them or to forsake and destroy them and it is a peculiar priuiledge of this rodde to smite and wound the conscience the apostolicall rodde was a certaine extraordinary power whereby god inabled them to plague and punish rebellious offenders with grieuous iudgements not in their soules but in their body alone with this rod paul smote elimas blind amp peter smote ananias and saphira with bodily death and it may be that paul by this power did giue up the incestuous man when he was excommunicate to be vexed in his body and tormented by the deuill but that by this rodde the apostles could smite conscience it can not be prooued arg tim paul made a law that none hauing two wiues should be ordained a bishop now this law is positiue and ecclesiasticall and bindes conscience answer paul is not the maker of this law but god himselfe who ordained that in mariage not three but two alone should be one flesh and that they which serue at the altar of the lord should be holy and to graunt that this law were a new law beside the written word of god yet doeth it not follow that paul was the maker of it because he used not to deliuer any doctrine to the churches but that which he receiued of the lord argum luke he which heareth you heareth me answer these wordes properly concerne the apostles and doe not in like maner belong to pastors amp teachers of the church and the end of these wordes is not to confirme any apostolicall authority in making lawes to the conscience but to signifie the priviledge which hee had vouchsafed them aboue all others that he would so farre forth assist them with his spirite that they should not erre or be deceiued in teaching amp publishing the doctrine of saluation though otherwise they were sinfull man according to matth it is not you that speake but the spirite of my father which speaketh in you and the promise to be led into all truth was directed vnto them arg corinthian i praise you that yee keepe my commandements answer paul deliuered nothing of his owne concerning the substance of the doctrine of saluation amp the worship of god but that which he receiued from christ the precepts here ment are nothing else but rules of decencie amp comely order in the congregation and though they were to be obeyed yet pauls meaning was not to binde any mans conscience therewith for of greater matters he saith this i speake for your commoditie and not to intangle you in a snare corinthian arg councels of ancient fathers when they commad or forbid any thing do it with threatning of a curse to the offenders ans the church in former time used to annexe vnto hir canons the curse anathema because things decreed by them were indeed or at the least thought to be the will and word of god and they had respect to the saying of paul if any teach otherwise though he be an angell from heauen let him be accursed therfore councels in this action were no more but instruments of god to accurse those whome he first of all had accursed arg an act indifferent if it be commanded is made necessary amp the keeping of it is the practise of vertue therefore euery law bindes conscience to a sinne ans an act in it selfe indifferent being commaded by mans law is not made simply necessary for that is as much as god law doth or can doe but only in some part that is so far forth as the said act or action tends to maintaine and preserue the good end for which the law is made and though the action be in this regard necessary yet doth it still remaine indifferent as it is considered in it selfe out of the ende of the law so as if peace the common good amp comely order may be maintained amp all offence auoided by any other meanes the act may be done or not done without sinne before god for whereas god himselfe hath giuen liberty amp freedome in the use of things indifferent the law of man doeth not take away the same but onely moderate and order it for the common good arg the fast of lent stands by a lawe and commandement of man and this lawe bindes conscience simply for the ancient fathers haue called it a tradition apostolicall and make the keeping of it to be necassary and the not keeping of it a sinne and punish the offenders with excommunication answer it is plaine to him that will not be obstinate that lent fast was not commaunded in the primitiue church but was freely kept at mens pleasures amp in seuerall churches diuersly both in regard of space of time as also in respect of diversity of meats ireneus in his epistle to victor ed by eusebius saith some have thought that they must fast o day some two daies some more some houres day and night which diversitie of fasting commendeth the vnitie of faith spiridion a good man did eate flesh in lent and caused his guest to doe the same and this he did upon iudgemet because he was perswaded out of god worde that to the clean all things were cleane and eusebius recordes that montanus the hereuke was the first that prescribed solemne and set lawes of fasting and whereas this fast is called an apostolicall tradition it is no great matter for it was the manner of the ancient church in former times to tearme rites and orders ecclesiasticall not set downe in scriptures apostolicall orders that by this meanes they might commend them to the people as ierome testifieth every province saith he may thinke the constitutions of the ancestours to be apostolicall lawes and whereas it is said to be a sinne not to fast in lent as augustine speaketh it is not by reason of any commandement binding conscience for augustine saith plainly that neither christ nor his apostles appointed any set time of fasting amp chrysostom that christ neuer commanded vs to follow his fast but the true reason hereof is borrowed from the ende for the primitiue church vsed not the popish fast which is to eat whitmeate alone but an abstinence from all meates vsed specially to morufie the flesh and to prepare man before hand to a worthy receiuing of the eucharist and in regarde of this good ende was the offence and whereas it is said that auncient fathers taught a necessitie of keeping this fast euen hierome whome they alledge to this purpose saith the contrary for confuting the errour of montanus who had his set times of fast to be kept of necessity hee saith we fast in lent according to the apostles tradition as in a time meete for vs and wee doe it not as though it were not lawful for vs to fast in the rest of the yeere except penticost but it is one thing to doe a thing of necessitie and anothing to offer a gift of free vvill lastly excommunication was for the open contempt of this order taken vp in the church which was that man should fast before faster for their further humiliation amp preparation to the sacrament so the cano of the councill of must be understood as for the canons of the apostles so falsely called and the councill of toledo i much respect not what they say in this case arg god authority binds conscience magistrates authority is god authority therefore magistrates authority binds conscience properly ans god authority may be take two waies first for that soueraigne and absolute power which he useth ouer all his creatures secondly for that finite amp limited power which he hath that man shall exercise ouer man if the minor that magistrates authority is god authority be taken in the first sense it is false for the soueraigne power of god is mooue ic able if it be taken in the second sense the false for there be sundry authorities ordained of god as the authority of the father oner the childe of the master over the servant the authority of the master ouer his scholler which doe not properly and bind in conscience as the authority of god lawes doth by these arguments which i haue now answered amp by many other being but lightly it will appeare that necessary obedience is to be performed both to ciuil amp ecciesiasticall iurisdiction but that they haue a constraining power to bind conscience as properly as god laws do it is not yet prooued neither can it be as i will make manifest by other arguments arg he that makes a law binding consciece to mortal sinne hath power if not to saue yet to destroy because by sin which follows upon the transgressio of his law comes death amp danation but god is the only lawgiuer that hath this priuiledge which is after he hath giue his law vpo the breaking or keeping thereof to save or destroy iam there is one lawgiuer that can saue or destroy therfore god alone makes laws inding coscience properly amp no creature ca do the like answer is made that s iames speaks of the principall law giuer that by his own proper authority makes lawes amp doth in such manner saue amp destroy that he need not feare to be destroied of any amp that he speaks not of secondary lawgiuers that are deputies of god amp make laws in his name i say again that this answer stads not with the text for s iames speakes simply without distinctio limitatio or exceptio amp the effect of his reason is this no ma at all must slander his brother because no man must be iudge of the law amp no man can be iudge of the law because no man can be a law giuer to saue and destroy now then where be those persons that shall make lawes to the soules of man amp binde them unto punishment of mortall sinne considering god alone is the sauing amp destroying lawgiuer arg he that can make laws as truly binding conscience as god lawes can also prescribe rules of god worship because to bind the consciece is nothing els but to cause it to excuse for things that are well done and therefore truely please god amp to accuse for sinne wherby god is dishonoured but no man can prescribe rules of god worship amp humane lawes as they are humane laws appoint not the seruice of god esai ir fear towards me was taught by the precept of mat they worship me in vain teach doctrines which are the commandements of papists here make answer that by lawes of man we must understand such lawes as be unlawful or unprofitable being made without the authority of god or instinct of his spirit it is true indeed that these commandements of man were unlawful but the cause must be considered they were unlawful not because they commanded that which was unlawful amp against the will of god but because things in themselues lawful were commanded as parts of god worship to wash the outward part of the cup or platter amp to wash hands before meat are things in respect of civill use very lawful amp yet are these blamed by christ amp no other reason ca be rendred but this that they were prescribed not as things indifferent or ciuill but as matters pertaining to god worship it is not against god worde in some politike regards to make distinctions of meats amp drink amp times yet paul calls these things doctrines of devil because they were commaded as things wherein god would be worshipped arg god hath giuen a liberty to the conscience whereby it is freed fro all lawes of his own whatsoeuer excepting such lawes amp doctrines as are necessary to salvation column if yee be dead with christ ye are free fro the elemets of the world gal standye in the liberty wher with christ hath freedyou and be not againe intangled with the yoke of bondage nowe if humane lawes made after the graunt of this libertie bind conscience property then must they either take away the foresaid libertie or diminish the same but that they cannot doe for that which is grated by an higher authority namely god himself cannot be reuoked or repealed by the inferiour authoritie of any man it is answered that this freedome is onely from the bondage of sinne from the curse of the morall law from the ceremoniall and iudiciall lawes of moses and not from the lawes of our superiours and i answer againe that it is absurd to thinke that god giues vs libertie in conscience from any of his owne laws and yet will haue our consciences stil to remaine in subiection to the laws o sinnefull man arg whosoeuer bindes conscience commaunds conscience for the bonde is made by a commadement vrging conscience to do his dutie which is to accuse or excuse for euill or well doing now god laws commaund conscience in as much as they are spirituall commaunding bodie and spirit with all the thoughts will affections desires and faculties and requiring obedience of them all according to their kinde as for the laws of man they want power to commaund conscience in deede if it were possible for our gouernours by law to commaund mens thoughts and affections then also might they command coscience but the first is not possible for their lawes can reach no further then to the outward man that is to bodie and goods with the speaches and deedes thereof and the ende of them all is not to maintaine spirituall peace of conscience which is betweene man and god but onely that externall and ciuill peace which is betweene man and man and it were not meete that man should commaund conscience which cannot see conscience and iudge of all her actions which appeare not outwardly and whereof there be no witnesses but god and the conscience of the doer lastly man are no fitte commanders of conscience because they are no lord of it but god himselfe alone argum man in making lawes are subiect to ignorance and errour and therefore when they haue made a law as neare as possible they can agreeable to the equitie of god law yet can they not assure themselues and others that they haue failed in no point or circumstance therefore it is against reason that humane laws beeing subiect to defects faults errours and manifold imperfections should truly bind conscience as god lawes doe which are the rule of righteousnes all gouernours in the world vpon their daily experience see and acknowledge this to be true which i say by reason that to their olde lawes they are constrained to put restrictions ampliations modifications of all kindes with new readings and interpretations saving the bishop of rome so falsly tearmed which perswades himselfe to haue when he is in his consistorie such an infallible assistance of the spirite that he can not possibly erre in iudgement argum if mens lawes by inward vertue binde conscience properly as god lawes then our dutie is to learne studie and remember them as well as god laws yes ministers must be diligent to preach them as they are diligent in preaching the doctrine of the gospell because euery one of them bindes to mortall finne as the papists teach but that they should be taught and learned as god lawes it is most absurd in the iudgement of all man papists themselues not excepted argum inferiour authoritie can not binde the superiours no we the courts of and their authoritie are vnder conscience for god in the heart of euery man hath rocted a tribunall seale and in his stead he hath pl d neither saint nor angell not any other crea what soeuer but conscience it selfe who therefore is the highest iudge that is or can be vnder god by whose direction also courts are kept and lawes are made thus much of the popish opinion by which it appeares that one of the principall notes of antichrist agrees fuly to the pope of rome paul thess makes it a speciall propertie of antichrist to exalt himselfe against or aboue all that is called god or worshipped now what doth the pope els when he takes vpon him authoritie to make such lawes as shall binde the conscience as properly and truly as god lawes and what doth he els when he ascribes to himselfe power to free mens consciences from the bond of such lawes of god as are vnchaungeable as may appeare in a canon of the councill of trent the words are these if any shall say that th se degrees of consanguinitie which be expressed in leviticus e hinder to be made and breake it beeing made and that the church cannot dispense with some of them or appoint that more degrees may hinder or breake age let him be accursed o sacrilegious impietie considering the lawes of affinitie and consanguinitie lev are not ceremoniall or iudiciall lawes peculiar to the iewes but the very laws of nature wh this canon els but a publike proclamation to the world that the pope and church of rome doe sit as lord or rather idols in the hearts amp consciences of man this will yet more fully appeare to any man if we read popish bookes of practical or case aivinitie in which the common manner is to binde conscience where god looseth it and to loose where he bindes but a declaration of this requires long time now i come as neare as possibly i can to set downe the true manner how mens lawes are by diuines and may be said to binde conscience that this may be cleared two things must be handled by what meanes they binde and how farre forth touching the meanes i set downe this rule whole some lawes of man made of things indifferent binde conscience by vertue of the generall commaundement of god vvhich ordaineth the magistrates authoritie so as vvho soever shall wittingly amp willingly with a disloyal mind either breake or omit such lavves it guiltie of s e before god by whole some lawes i vnderstand such positiue constitutions as are not against the law of god and withall tend to maintaine the peaceable estate and common good of man furthermore i adde this clause made of things indifferent to note the peculiar matter where lawes properly things are neither commanded or forbidden by god now such kinde of lawes haue no vertue or power in themselues to constraine conscience but they bind onely by vertue of an higher commandement let euery soule e subiect to the higher powers rom or honour father and mother exod which commaundements binde vs in conscience to performe obedience to the good laws of man as s peter saith submit your selues to euery humane ordinance for the lord pet that is for conscience of god as he saith afterward v wherby he signifieth two thing first that god hath ordained the authority of gouernours secondly that he hath appointed in his word and thereby bound man in conscience to obay their gouernours lawful commandements if the case fall out otherwise as commonly it doth that humane laws be not inacted of things indifferent but of things that be good in themselues that is commanded by god then are they not properly but divine lawes mens laws intreating of things that are morally good and the parts of god vvorshippe are the same with god laws and therfore binde conscience not because they were inacted by man but because they were first made by god man beeing no more but instruments and ministers in his name to revive renew and to put in exequution such precepts and laws as prescribe the worship of god standing in the practise of true religion amp vertue of this kind are all positiue lawes touching articles of faith amp the duties of the morall law and the man that breakes such lawes sinnes two waies first because he breaks that which is in conscience a law of god secondly because in disobaying his lawful magistrate he disob the generall commandement of god touching magistracie but if it shall fall out that mens lawes be made of things that are cuill and forbidden by god then is there no bonde of conscience at all but contrariwise man are bound in conscience not to obay act and hereupon the three children are commended for not obaying nabuchadnezzar when he gaue a particular commandement vnto them to fall downe and worship the golden image daniel moreouer in that mans law binds onely by power of god law hence it follows that god law alone hath this priuiledge that the breach of it should be a sinne s john saith epistle sinne it the anomie or transgressio of the law vnderstanding god lawe when dauid by adulterie and murder had offended many man amp that many waies he saith psalm against thee against thee haue i sinned and augustine defined sinne to be some thing said done or desired against the law of god some man may say if this be so belike then we may breake mens laws without sinne i answer that man in breaking humane lawes both may and doe sinne but yet not simply because they breake them but because in breaking them they doe also breake the law of god the breach of a law must be considered two waies first as it is a trespasse hinderance iniurie damage and in this respect it is committed against mens lawes secondly the breach of a law must be considered as it is sinne and so it is onely against god law the second point namely how farreforth mens lawes binde conscience i explane on this manner it is all that the lawes of god doe or can doe to binde conscience simply and absolutely therefore humane laws bind not simply but so farre forth as they are agreeable to god word serue for the comongood stad withgood order and hinder not the libertie of conscience the necessitie of the law ariseth of the necessitie of the good end thereof and as the end is good and profitable more or lesse so is the law it selfe necessarie more or lesse hence it followeth that a man may doe any thing beside humane lawes and constitutions without breach of conscience for if he shall omit the doing of any law i without hindrance of the ende and particular considerations for which the law was made ii without offence giuing as much as in him lieth iii without contempt of him that made the law he is not to be accused of sinne example in time of war the magistrate of a citie commands that no man shall open the gates the end is that the citie and euery member thereof may be in safetie now it falls out that certaine citizens beeing vpon occasion without the citie are pursued by the enemie and in daunger of their lifes herupon some man within openeth the gate to res e them the question is whether he haue sinned or no and the truth is he hath not because he did not hinder the ende of the law but rather further it and that without scandal to man or contempt to the magistrate and this stands euen by the equitie of god word god made a law that the priests onely should eate of the shewbread now dauid being no priest did vpon vrgent occasion eate of it without sinne if this be true in god law then it may also be true in the lawes of man that they may in some cases be omitted without sinne against god neither must this seeme strange for as th re is a keeping of a law and a breaking of the same so there is a middle or meane action betw ne them both which is to doe thing fa aliquid pr ter beside the law and that without s e to proceede further mens laws be either civill or ecclesiasticall civill laws are for their substance determinations of necessarie and profitable circumstances tend to hold and maintaine the commandem of the more specially they prescribe what is to be do and what is to be left vndone touching actions both civill amp criminal touching offices and b rgines of all so ampc yes they conclude inioyne amp commad not onely such affaires as be of smaller importace but also things amp actions of great waight tending to maintaine common peace civill societie and the very state of the common wealth now such laws binde so farre forth that though they be omitted without any apparan s ndal or contemp yet the breach of them is a sinne against god take this example a subiect in this lande vpon pouertie or vpon a couctous minde against the good law of the land coines money which after ward by a sleight of his wit is cunningly conuaied abroad into the hands of man and is not espied here is no euident offence giuen to any man nor open contempt shewed to the lawgiuer and yet in this action he hath sinned in that closely otherwise then he ought to haue done he hath hindered the good of the common wealth and robbed the soueraigne prince of her right ecclesiastes sticall lawes are certaine necessarie and profitable determinations of circumstances of the commaundements of the first table i say b e because all doctrines pertaining to the foundation and good estate of the church as also the whole worshippe of god downe and comma nded in the written word of god and cannot be prescribed and concluded otherwise by all the churches in the world a or the creedes and confession of particular churches they are in substance god word and they binde not in conscience by any power the church hath but because they are the word of god the lawes then which the church in proper speach is s de to make are decrees concerning outward order and comelines in the administration of the word and sacram s in the meetings of the cogregation ampc amp such laws made according to the generall rules of god word which requires that all things be don to edificatio in comelines for the auoiding of offence are cessarie to be obserued and the word of god binds all man to the so farre forth as the keeping of them maintains decent order and p s open offence yet if a law concerning some nall ri e of thing indifferent be at some time vpon some occasion omitted no offence giuen not contempt shewed to ecclestasticall horitie there is no b each made in the conscience d that appeares by the example before han the apostles guided by the holy ghost made a decree for the auoiding of offence necessarie to be obserued namely that the gentiles should abstaine from strangled and blood and ido ithy s and yet paul out of the case of scandall and contempt permits the corinthians to doe otherwise corinthian amp which he would not h done if to doe otherwise out of the case of scandall and contempt had bin sinne againe lawes are either mixt or meerely penall mix are such lawes as are of weightie matters and are propounded in comanding or forbidding ea es and they binde man first of all to obedience for the necessary good of humane societies and secondly to a punishment if they obay not that a supplie may be made of the indrance of the common good in the breach of this kind of laws though a man be neuer so willing to suffer the punishment yet that will not discharge his conscience before god when he of ds if a man coin mo y with this minde to be willing to die when he is con icted yet that will not free him from a sinne in the action because god law binds vs not onely to subiection i earing of punishments but also to obedience of his e commandement it beeing lawful though e should set downe no punishment a law meerely pe ll is that which beeing m of matters of lesse importance and not vt d pre isely in comm ding tearmes doeth onely declare and shewe what is to be done or conditionally require this or that with respect to the punishment on this manner if any person doe this or that then he shall forfeit thus or thus this kind of law kinds especially to the punishment amp that in the very intent of the lawgiuer and he that is readie in omitting the law to pay the fine or punishmet is not to be charged with sinne before god the penaltie being answerable to the losse that comes by the neglect of the law thus we see how farre forth mens laws bind conscience the vse of this points is this i hence wee learne that the immunitie of the popish cleargie whereby they take themselues exempted from civill courts and from civill authoritie in criminall causes hath no warrant because god commandements binds euery man whatsoeuer to be subiect to the magistrate r let euery soule be s ct to the higher powers ii hence we see also what notorio rebe those are that beeing borne subi cts of this land yet choose rather to die then to acknowledge as they are bound in con the q ma estie to be supreame gouernour vnder god in all causes amp ouer all persons iii lastly we are taught hereby to be readie and willing to giue subiection obedience reuerence and all other duties to magistrates whether they be superiou or inferiour yes with chearefulnes to pay and subsidies and all such lawful charges appointed by them giue to ces that cesars amp to god that which is go rom giue to their dutie tribute to tribute to whome custome now follows the oath which is either assertorie or promissorie assertorie by which a man auoucheth that a thing was done or not done promisserie by which a man promiseth to doe a thing or not to doe it of both these i mean to speak but specially of the second and here two points must be cosidered the first by what means an oath bindeth the second when it bindeth an oath bindeth by vertue of such particu comandements as require the keeping of oath lawfully taken number who soeuer s an ath to binde his soule by a bond e shall not his word shall doe according to all that of his this being so questio may be made whether the of insi bi d conscience amp by what v they ither know the script no the true god a s they thu saith aug epistle ad public amp l d s dist doe bind in conscience for example iacob amp laban make a confirmed by oath iacob sweares by the true god laban by the god of n or that i his idols now iacob though he approoue not the forme of this oath yet he accepts it for a civil bond of the covenant amp no doubt though laban beleeued not god word reuealed to the p ks yet he was bound in coscience to keep this th euen by the law of nature amp though he not the god yet he the false god of nac r to be the true god gen againe if a lawful oath by vertue of god comandements bind conscience then it must need be that the romane church hath long erred in that ee th and maintaineth that gouernours as namely the pope and other inferiour bishops haue power to giue relaxations and dispensations not onely for oathes unlawful from which the word of god doth sufficiently free vs though they should neuer giue absolutio but from a true amp lawful oath made wittingly amp willingly without errour or deceit of a thing honest and possible as when the pope frees the subiects of this land as occasion is offered from their sworne allegiance and loyaltie to which they are bound not onely by the law of nature but also by a solemne and particular oath to the supremacie which none euer deemed v full but such as carrie traytors hearts now this erronious divinitie would easily be revoked if man did b consider the nature of an oath one part whereof is invocation in which we pr vnto god first that he would become a witnes vnto vs that we speak the truth and purpose not to deceiue secondly if we faile amp break our promise that he would take ge vpon vs and in both these petitions we bind our selues immediatly to god himselfe and god againe who is the ordainer of the oath accepts this bond and it by his commendement till it be accomplished hence it follows that no creature ca haue power to v ie the bood of an th that is truly and lawfully an th vnles we wil the creatures aboue god himselfe and our sauiour christ gaue better ell when he commanded vs to performe our to the lord for the p ting of periurie matth next let vs consider the time when an oath bindeth or bindeth not an oth bindeth the when it is made of things certen amp possible in uth iustice iudgemet for the glory of god amp the good of our neighbour question i whether doeth an oath binde conscience if by the keeping of it there followe losses and hinderances answer if it be of a thing that is lawful and the domages be priuate to him that sweareth then doth it bind conscience for example a man makes a purchase of lande at the sea side his bargaine is confirmed only by oath and it falles out that before he doe enter possession the sea breakes in and drownes a part of that purchase now he is in conscience to stand to his bargaine because the thing is lawful amp the domage is priuate amp great reuerence must be had of the name of god which hath bin used in the bargaine making dauid makes it the property of a good man to sweare to his owne hinderance and not to change psalm v question ii whether the oath which a man hath taken being induced thereto by fraud and guile doeth bind conscience answer if it be still of a thing lawful and bring nothing but priuate losses it is to be kept when the gibe ites had by a fraud brought iosua to make a league with them and to binde it with an oath hee and the princes of the people answer them thus wee have sworne vnto them by the lord god of israel now therefore wee may not touch them ios and yeres after when saul slewe certaine of the gib onites against this othe the plague of was upon the people of israel three yeeres and was not staied till certaine persons of sauls family for a recompence were put to death sam v question iii whether an oath made by feare or compulsion bind in conscience for example a thiefe disappointed of the bo y he looked for bindes the true man by solemne oath upon paine of present death to fetch and deliuer vnto him some portion of money at one or crownes for the redeeming of his life well the oath is taken and the question is whether it bind him or not to perform his promise an answer may be this some p mel in de protestant diuines thinke it doth bind some againe thinke no but i take it the safest course to bolde the meane betweene both on this manner the oth seemes to bind and is to be perfourmed neither is it against the good of the comon wealth then it were unlawful but it is rather a furtherance in that a member therof is preserued and the losses which follow are only priuate to the man rather to be endured then the losse of life yet that a remedy may be had of this priuate iniury amp that a publike mischiefe may be preuented the party is to reueale the matter to the magistrate whose office it is to punish robbers and to order all things according to equity for the comon good but if the case fall out that the ma through exceeding feare doe further sweare to keep silence i see not how his oth may be kept except he be sure that nothing will ensue therof but a pri domage to himself for otherwise perpetu ence seemes to be a secrete consenting to the robber amp an occasion that others fall into the like danger and hazard of their liues ag ne in six cases an oth binds not conscience at all i if it be made of a thing that is flat against the word of god for all the power of binding which it hath is by the word of god amp therfore whe it is against god will it hath no power to constraine and it is an old receiued rule that an oth must not be a bonde of iniquity hereupon dauid when he had made a rash oth to kill nabal amp his houshold reioyced when he had an occasion offered by abigail to break the same sam and though he sware to shemi that he would saue his life sam yet afterward upon better consideration as it may seem he commanded his son salomon to put him to death as one that had long agoe deserued the same king and herod was far deceiued that thought he was bound by his oth to giue to the dasell john baptists head in a platter mat ii is it be against the good and wholesome lawes of any kingdome or countrey whereof a man is a member it bindes not at all because on the contrary god commandement bindes vs to keepe the good lawes of man iii if it be made by such persons as want sufficient reason and discretion as young children fooles madde man for the conscience can not indeed be bounde where the understanding can not discerne what is done iiii if it be made of such as haue no power to bind themselues it bindes not because it is made against the lawe of nature which is that qui sui i ri non est obligar se non potest a bellarm li de cap he which is ot in his owne power can not binde himselfe hence it followes that papists erre grossely when they teach that a childe may enter into any rule or order of religion yes binde himselfe thereto by oath and the oath to be good flatt against his parents consent number if a woman vow vnto the lord amp bind her selfe by a bond being in her fathers house in the time of her youth ampc if her father disallow her the same day that he heareth all her vowes and bondes they shall not be of value and an ancient councill decreed that all children that vpon pretence of god worship should depart from their parents and not doe them d e reverence should be accursed secondly they erre in that they teach that the promise made priuately by a childe in way of marriage without and against consent of wise and careful parents bindes them whereas indeede if this promise were further bound by an oth it could not stand because children under gouernment and tuition of parents can not giue themselues v it bindes not if it be made of a thing that is out of a ns power as if a man sweare to his friend to giue him another mans goods vi if at the first it were lawful and afterwarde by some meanes become either impossible or unlawful it binds not conscience for when it becomes impossible then wee may safely thinke that god from heauen frees a man from his oath and when it beginnes to be unlawful then it ceaseth to bind because the binding vertue is onely from the worde of god for example a king bindes himselfe by oath to a foreign christian prince to find him man amp money to defende his people against all enemy this oath is lawful well afterward the prince becomes a professed enemy to him his religion amp people and then the kings oth becomes unlawful and binds him not because the word forbids that there should be any league of amitie with god enemy though there may be leagues of concord with them seeing a lawful oath must bind conscience though a man be deceiued and great losses follow it shews in how great reuerence we should haue god name and with what care and consideration take an oth and by this we must be aduertiseo to take heed of customable swearing in our common talke whether our oathes be great or small we must thinke of an oth as a part of god worship nay the h ghost often puts it for the whole worship of god isai in that day shall five cities in the lande of egypt speake the language of canaan and shall sweare by the lorde of hostes that is acknowledge and worship him ierem if they will learne the waies of my people to sweare by my name the lorde liveth then shall they be built in the middest of my people this serues to shew unto us that such as giue them selues to swearing want religion amp good conscience amp that those families in which there is risenesse of othes abandon all care of religion and banish god out of their houses and indeed it is a very hard thing for the common swearer to auoide common periury if we see a man holde up his hand at the barre of an earthly iudge we pity him and are sorry for him on then why doe we not pittie blasphemers and common swearers for with god they are no better then rebeis that hold up their hands at the barre of his iudgement seate as guilty malefactours exod augustine saith well they that worship stockes and stones feare to svveare falsely by stones and doest not then feare god that is present god that liveth god that god that taketh revenge of contemners but of bad custome vvhen thou article beleeved thou svvearest vvhen none requires it thou svvearest and vvhen man cannot abide it then svvearest thus much of an oath now followes a promise which is either to god or man the first is called a vow the second a single promise a vowe is taken three waies first generally for a promise of morall obedience and this vowe is first made in baptisme and continued in the lordes supper as also in the spirituall exercises of invocation and repentance it is called of peter epistle the stipulation which a good conscience makes to god this kinde of vowe bindes all and euery member of the church of god and the not keeping of it is the common sinne of the worlde for most man make not conscience to perfourme that which they haue promised to god in baptisme and therefore their baptisme is become unto them the sacrifice of fooles ecclesiast but considering we are bound in conscience by this vowe let vs hereafter endeauor to be as good as our word and that shall be when we begin to die to our sinnes and rise to newnesse of life we will seeme to haue care to keepe touch with man what a shame is it for us then not to keepe couenant with god againe a vow is taken for a promise of ceremoniall obedience whereof reade number and and levit this vow is peculiar to the old testament and did not bind all man but only such as had peculiar occasion to vowe and thereupon bound themselues as the nazarites and some other thirdly a vow is taken for the performance of some outwarde and bodily exercises taken up of a mans owne accord as being things in a mans owne liberty without any commaundment of god as the keeping of set times of fast of praying or reading the performance of set taskes almes giuing abstinence from certaine meates and drinkes in the use whereof through our owne weakenesse we feare any occasion of sinne and this kind of vow is more peculiar to the new testament in the making of it that it may be warrantable foure things must be obserued i it must be agreeable to the worde of god ii it must not be against a mans generall or particular calling iii it must be in a mans power and not against christian liberty iiii it must be so made and be obserued without any opinion of rit or worship of god to this end alone that it may be a means to exercise and cherish repentance and inuocation temperance patience and to shewe forth thankfulnesse to god a vowe thus made binds conscience by vertue of god commandement ecclesiastes when thou hast a vow to god not to pay it and the vow once made continues to binde so long as the thing is in force which was the of the vow for example a man desirous to practise sobrietie and temperancy finds that drink of wine is hurtful to him hereupon he vowes to god to drinke no wine now vow once made him estate of his body alter and he feele no inconvenience in wine and then ceaseth to bind any longer question whether papists are bound in conscience to keepe the vowes of single life and voluntary pouerty which they make or no ans no reasons i they are against god co if they cannot abstaine let them for it is better to marry then to corinthian this we warned of that if there were would not they should not thess ii they are not in the power of him that voweth as the promise of chastity in single life iii they abolish christian liberty in the vse of the creatures and ordinances of god as riches and mariage meat drinke appar making that necessary which god left to our liberty iv they are made that man may thereby merit life eternall amp worship god whereas paul saith tim bodilyexercise profiteth little but godlinesse profitable for all things therefore they are better broken then kept as for a single promise it also bindes a man according as he will to whome the promise is made though he be an heretike or an infidell as for the purpose of the mind it binds not but may upon conuenient cause be altered yet we must remember that there are so cases in which a promise made binds not i if it be against god word one saith well in evill promises cut off thy faith it is a promise which cannot be perfourmed without an offence ii if he which makes it want reason or sufficient discretion iii if he make the promisae who can not bind himselfe as a child under the gouernment of his parents iv if a man be induced to make his promise by fraud amp guile v if the promise being at the first lawful become afterward either impossible or unlawful and though man be bound in conscience to keepe their promises yet this hinders not but that there is and may be a good and lawful use of indentures and obligations for the bonde of conscience is betweene man and god but the bonde of an obligation is onely betweene man and man abraham when hee bought a purchase of ephron the hi te hee payed his money and made it sure before witnesse gen verse here we must consider the generall sinne of this age which is to speak deceitfully euery one to his neighbour it is an hard thing to find a ma that will stand to his word and lawful promise it is a rule of machi vell that a man may practise many things against his faith against charity and humanity and religion and that it is not necessary to haue these vertues but to counterfait and dissemble them but let all such as feare god make conscience of their word because they are bound so to do and hereby they shall resemble their heauenly father who is true in all his promises and they shall also bring soorth a notable fruite of the spirite galat verse hitherto i haue spoken of the cause that maketh conscience to giue iudgemente now followeth the manner of iudgement cosciece giues iudgemet in or by a kind of reasoning or disputing called a practicall syllogisme rom their reasonings excusing other in the making of this reason conscience hath two assist mind and memory the mind is the storehouse and of all manner of rules and principles it may be co pared to a booke of law in which are down the penall statutes of the lande the of it it is to preferre and present to the conscience rules of diuine law whereby it is to giue iudgement memory serues to bring to mind the particular actions which a ma hath done or not done that conscience may determine of them now conscience assisted by these proceeds in iudgement by a kinde of argumentation an example whereof we may take from the conscience of a murder thus euery er is ed saith the minde thou article a murder saith conscience assisted by memory ergo thou article accur sed saith conscience and so giueth her sentence to proceed conscience giues iudgement either of things past or things to come of things past two waies either by accusing amp cond ning or by excusing amp absoluing ro to accuse is an action of conscience giuing that this o that thing was ll don that still by reasoning on this manner is a this thy action is der this thy action is a to is another action of the conscience yned with the former whereby it giueth iudg t that a man by this or that sinne hath deserued death on this maner ry rer serveth a double death th article a rer ergo thou hast de served a double death these two actions are very sorcible and terrible for they are the ctions and prickings that be in the heart act they are the stripes as it were of an iron rodde wherewith the heart of a man smiteth it selfe sam and by reason of them conscience is compared to a wo e that neuer dieth but alwayes lyes gnawing and grabbling and pulling at the heart of man marc and causeth more paine and anguish then any disease in the wo ld can the time when conscience perfourmes these actions is not before the sinne or in the acte of s ing but specially after the sinne is done and past reason i before a man sinne the deuill doth extenuate the fault amp make sinne to be no sinne ii corrupt affections doe for a time so blind and ouercast iudgement that it doeth not see or at the least consider what is good or bad till afterward neither doth conscience ccuse amp conde only for time present but also long after a thing is done the consciences of iosephs hren accuse them yeres after they had solde him into egypt gen the effect of the accusing and conde ning conscience is to stir vp sundry passions and otions in the heart but specially these five the first is sha which is an affection of the heart whereby a man is gr eued and displeased with him selfe that hee hath done any euill and this shame showeth it selfe by the rising of the bloode from the heart to the yet wee must here remember that such as haue the pardon of their sinnes and are not guilty may be ashamed and b sh rom what fr had yee in those things wherat ye now blush or be ashamed whereas those which are most guilty may be without all shame ierem were they they had itted y y they vvere not ashamed they because they are growen to some great height in sinne ephesians the second passion is sadnesse and sorrowe which is commonly thought to be nothing else but melancholy but betweene them twa e there is great difference sorow that comes by melancholly ariseth onely of that humour annoying the body but this other sorrow ariseth of a mans sinnes for which his conscience accuseth him melancholly may be cured by phi e this sorow not be cured by any thing but by the blood of christ the third is feare in causing whereof conscience is very forcible if a man had all the delightes and pleasures that heart can wish they can not doe him any good if conscience be guiltie belshazzar when hee was in the middest of all his delights and saw the hand writing vpon the wall his countenance changed his thoughts trouble him his ioy ts loosed and his knees smote togither daniel yes the guiltie conscience will make a man afraid if hee see but a worme peepe out of the ground or a silly creature to goe crosse his

booke of wisedome saith truly cap verse it is a full thing vvhen malice is condemned by test monie and a conscience th is ever fore cast cruell things for feare is nothing else but the betraying of the succ that reason offereth ampc they that did the night that was llerable ampc sometimes vvere troubled vvith mon s visions and sometimes they s ned as though their soule should betray them for a

this made saul achitophel and indas to hang them selues this makes many in these daies to doe the like as appeareth by the declarations of such as haue bene presented when they were about to hang or drowne them selues or to cutt their owne throats the last is a perturbation or disquie es of the whole man wherby all the powers amp faculties of the whole man are forth of order isa the wicked are like the raging of the sea that test vvhose vvaters cast vp ire and rt thus much of the two first actions of conscience which are to accuse and condemne the s cond followeth to excuse and absolue to excuse is an action of the conscience giuing iudgement that the thing is well done to absolue is an action of the conscience giuing iudgement that a man is free or cleare fro fault and so from punishment from these two actions arise some special affections i bold es and confidence prov the righteous are bold as a lyon ii ioy and reioycing corinthian our reioycing is the testi nie of my conscience that in all simplicitie and godly pure es i haue had my conuer sation in the world hence it is said that a good conscience is a continuall feast hithe to i haue spoken how conscience giues iudgement of things done and past now followeth her iudgement of things to be done conscience giues iudgement of things to come by foretelling and as it were saying inwardly in the heart that the thing may be well done or ill done of this kinde of iudgement euery man may haue experience in him selfe when he is about to enterprise any busines either good or badde by this we may see the goodnes of god to all man if a man beeing to make an vnknowne iourney should finde one that would goe with him and shew him the way with al the turnings thereof he could not but take it for a great point of curtosie wee are pilgrimes in this world our life is our iourney god also hath appointed our conscience to be our companion and guide to shew vs what course we may take and what we may not and here it must be noted that in all things to be done conscience is of great force amp beares a great stroke for this is the beginning of a good vvorke that the conscience first of all give her iudgement truely that the thing may be done and is acceptable to god rom whatsoeuer is not of faith that is whatsoeuer is not done of a settled perswasion in iudgement and conscience out of god word howsoeuer man iudge of it is sinne againe god regardes not the outward pompe of the action or the doer but obedience and especially the obedience of the heart therefore vnlesse the conscience first of all approoue the thing to be good and agreeable to god will it can be nothing else but a sinne and he that shall doe a thing because it is good in his owne eyes not knowing that god doeth allow of it preferres him selfe before god and disobaies him as the servant that in his masters house will not doe his masters will but his owne will from this former rule arise three other the first what soeuer is done vvith a doubting conse e is a s e for example some beleeuers in the primitive church held that still after the ascens on of christ there remained a difference betweene meate and meate and therefore it was a scruple to them to eate of sundrie kinde of meates ow put the case by example they are drawne on to eate swines flesh or some other thing which they thinke is forbidden and there no question but in so doing they haue sinned as paul prooueth rom v i knovv and persvvaded through the lord iesus that there is nothing vncleane of it selfe but vnto him that iudgeth any thing vncleane it is vncleane and v he that doubteth is condemned if he eate because he eateth not of faith the second what soeuer thing is done vvith an erroneous conscience is a sinne for example in the primitiue church diverse of the gentiles helde this errour that fornication was a thing indifferent and therfore onscience told them that they might doe i and yet neuerthelesse fornication in them was a sinne becaus conscience erred in her iudgement and euill r maines euill though conscience y the contrarie a thousand times the third what soeuer is done erronious conscience bindeth for he that iudgeth a thing to be euill if he doe it hath sinned as much as in hi lieth against conscience though it erre amp be deceiued it sinne in the d er example an anabaptist holding it vtterly unlawful to sweare is brought before a magistrate and vrged either through feare or so cause takes an oath amp that against his o ne conscience now the question is whether he hath sinned or no ans he hath indeed sinned not so much because he hath taken an oath for that is the ordinance of god but because he hath taken an oath in a bad manner that is against his conscience and therefore not in faith thus it is manifest that consci nce beares a great stroke in all things that are to be saide or done and hereby we are aduertised of many things first if a thing done without good direction of coscience be a sinne then much more that which is done without direction of god word is a flatte sinne for without direction of god word conscience can giue no good direction and if god will holde that for a sinne which is done without direction of his word then no doubt god word ministers sufficient direction for all actions whatsoeuer so as if a man be to put but a bit of bread in his mouth it can so farre forth direct him that in doi g of it he shall be able to please god if this were ot true mans ease were most miserable for then we should sinne in manifold actions and that without remedie and here by the word i meane nothing but the scriptures of the olde and new testament which containe in themselues sufficient direction for all ctions as for the law of nature though it af oard in deede some direction yet is it corrupt imperfect vncerten and whatsoeuer is right and good therin is contained in the writte word of god and as for the best vnwritte traditions let al the papists in the world answer if they ca how i may in coscience be perswaded that they are the word of god if they say that the auncient fathers of the primitive church auouch in their writings that they are apostolicall traditions i answer againe how i know and be certen in conscience that the fathers subiect to errour in saying so haue not erred againe we learne hence that a good intention is not sufficient to make a good worke vnlesse withall conscience can giue iudgement that god doth approoue the action this shewes the ignorance of our people that when their dealings they runne vpon a good meaning then alwaies they thinke they doe well and please god thirdly hence it appeares that all thing deuised by man for the worship of god re fiarre sinnes because conscience not say of them that they please god isaiah mark v lastly wee learne here that ig or nce of god will and word is a daungerous thing and makes the life of man to abound yes to flowe with a sea of offences against god man commonly thinke that if they keepe themselues fro petiurie blasphemie murder theft whordome all is well with them but the truth is that so long as they liue in ignorance they want right and true direction of conscience out of god word and therfore there best actions are sinnes euen their eating and drink their sleeping and waking their buying and selling their speach and silence yes their praying and seruing of god for they doe these actions either of custome or example or necessitie as beast doe and not of faith because they know not god will touching things to be done or left vndone the consideration of this point should make euery man most carefull to seeke for knowledge of god word and daily to increase in it that he may in all his affaires haue god lawes to be the man of his counsell psalm that may giue heede to them as to a light shining in a rke place pet that he may say with p er when christ commanded him to lanch forth into the deepe and to cast forth his net lord ve h e ben all ight ana haue catched nothing yet in thy word vvill i let d vvne my t luke conscience is either good or badde good conscience is that which rightly according to god worde excuseth and comforteth for the excellence goodnes and dignitie of conscience standes not in accusing but in excusing and by doing any sinne whatsoeuer to giue an occasion to the conscience to use or condemne is to wound it and to offend in thus paul saith that the corinthians ded the consciences of their wh they vsed their libertie as an ccasian of offence to them corinthian agai he calleth a good conscience a conscience without offence that i which hath no stoppe o to hinder it from excusing act good conscience is either good by or by regeneration good by creation was the conscience of adam which in the estate of innocencie did onely excuse amp could not accu him for any thing though it may be an to accuse was not wanting afterward an occasion should be offered and hence we haue further direction to consider what a good conscience is namely such an one as by the order set downe in the creation ex th onely without accu cuse is a defect in the following ter the first creation fee na rally there is an agreement and harmony betweene the parts and the whole but if the conscience should naturally accuse there should be ad ssent and disagr ment and diuision betweene the conscience and the man himselfe regenerate conscience is that which b eing corrupt by nature is renewed and purged by faith in the blood of christ for to the regenerating of the conscience there is required a conversion or chaunge because by all mens consciences since the fall are euill and none are good but by grace the instrument ing to make this chaunge is faith act faith purifieth the heart the m orious cause is the blood of christ hebr how much more shal the blood of christ ampc purge your conscience fro dead works to s rue the liuing god the propertie of regenerate conscience is twofold christian amp c ttenti of saluation because both these haue their place not in the outward man but in the and conscience ch istian libe spirituall and holy freedome purchased by christ i say it is spi first to put a difference b ne it and civill libertie which standes in outward and bodily freedomes and priuiledges secondly to confute the iewes that looke for earthly libertie by christ and the anabaptists who imagine a freedome from all authoritie of magistrates in the kingdome of christ againe i say it is an holy freedome to confute the who thinke that by the death of christ they haue libertie to liue as they list lastly i say that it is purchased by christ to shew the author thereof gal standfast i the libertie vvhere with christ hath made you free and to confute the papists whose doctrine in effect is thus much that this libertie is pr red indeede by christ but is continued partly by christ and partly by the man himselfe christian libertie hath three parts the first is a freedome from the iustification of the morall lawe for he that is a member of christ is not bound in conscience to bring the perfect righteousnes of the law in his owne person for his iustification before god gal with v hence it followeth that he that is a christian is likewise freed from the curse and condemnation of the law rom there is no condemnation to them that are in christ gal christ hath redeemed vs from the curse of the law when he was made a curse for vs by this first part of christian libertie it appeares that there cannot be any iustification of a sinner by workes of grace before god for he that will be iustified but by one worke is debter to the vvhole lavv gal but no man that is a member of christ is debter to the whole law for his libertie is to be free in that point therefore no man is iustified so much as by one worke the second part is freedome from the rigour of the law which exacteth perfect obedience and condemneth all imperfection rom sinne hath no more dominion ouer yo for ye are not vnder the law but vnder grace ioh this is the loue of god that ye keepe his commandements and his commandements are not grieuous hence it followeth that god will accept of our imperfect obedience if it be sincere yes he accepts the will desire and indeauour to obay for obedience it selfe malach and i vvill spare them as a man spareth his owne son that serueth him the third part is that the conscience is freed from the bond of the ceremoniall law gal but after that faith is come we are no more vnder a schoolemaster ephesians and hath broken the stoppe of the partition wall in abrogating through his flesh the lavv of commaundements vvhich standeth in ordinances coloss and hath put out the hand vvriting of ordinances vvhich vvas against vs v let no man therefore condemne you in meate and drinke or in respect of an holy day or of the new moone ampc hence it followeth that all christians may freely without scruple of coscience vse all things indifferent so be it the manner of vsing them be good and first when i say that all may vse them i vnderstand a two fold vses naturall or spirituall the naturall vse is either to eleeue our necessities or for honest delite thus the psalmist saith that god giues not onely bread to strengthen the heart of man but also wine to make glad the heart amp oyle to make the face to shine psalm and god hath put into his creatures infinite varieties of colours sauours tastes and formes to this end that man might take delite in the hence it follows that recreation is lawful and a part of christian libertie if it be well vsed by recreation i vnderstand exercises and sports seruing to refresh either the bodie or the and that they may be well vsed two rules esp cially must be remembred the first that l full recreation stands only in the vse of things indifferent for if the things be commanded by god there is no sporting in them or if they be forbidden there is no vsing of them at all vpon this ground sundrie kindes of recreation are to be neglected as i the dauncing commonly vsed in these daies in which man and woman yongmen and ma s all mixed together daunce to the sound of the instrument or voyce in time and measure with many wanton gestures and that in solemne meetings after great feasts this exercise cannot be numbred among things indifferent for experience sheweth that it hath beene vsually either a fruit or a follower of great wickednes as idolatric fornication drunkennes hereupon one well compared it to a tripadium est circulus di b l circle whose center was the deuill againe if we must giue an account of euery idle worde then also of euery idle gesture and pace amp what account can be giuen of these paces backward and forward of caprings iumpes gambols turnings with many other riskes of lightnes and vanitie more beseeming goates and apes of whome they are commonly vsed then man whereas salomon esteemed laughter as madnesse he would no doubt haue condemned our common lascivious dauncing much more for madnesse laughter beeing but the least part of it ii dicing which is precisely the casting of a lotte not to be vsed at our pleasures but in matters of weight and importance and of this kinde are all games the ground whereof are not the sleight of mans witte but lotte alone iii playes and enterludes that stande in the representation of the vices and misdemeanour of the world for if it be not lawful to name vices vnles it be in the way of dislike ephesians much lesse is it warrantable to gesture and represent vice in the way of recreation and delite the second rule is that recreation must be a sparing moderate and lawful vse of things indifferent according to the rules following the spirituall vse is when we take occasion by the creatures to meditate and speake of heauenly things as vpon the sight of the vine and the branches thereof to consider the mysticall coniunction betweene christ and his church by the sight of the rainbow to think of the promise of god of not drowning the world by water and by any thing that befalls to take occasion to consider in it the wisdome goodnes iustice mercie providence of god ampc i adde further that things indifferent as bondage outward libertie riches pouertie single estate marriage meate drinke apparrell buildings may be vsed freely because they are neither commanded by god nor forbidden and in themselues considered they may be vsed or not vsed without breach of conscience the right manner of vsing them is to sanctifie them by the word and praier tim and not onely some of them but the vse of them all meate drinke and marriage are thus to be sanctified as the place before noted declareth paul sanctified his iourney on this manner act and the iewes were commanded to dedicate their houses at the first entrance deut by this dedication we may well vnderstand not onely the letting of the house or the prouiding of a tenant but also the sanctifying of it by invocation of god name that by his blessing the place with the roomes thereof might serue for their benefit and comfort and on this maner to blesse our dwelling places when we first enter into them is the best way that can be to preserue them from the casualties of fire within and lightning from heauen and from the annoiance and molestation of euill spirits and other iudgements of god things indifferent are sanctified by god word because it shewes what things we may vse and what things we may not and if we may vse them in what manner it is to be done and to this purpose the scriptures affoard foure rules the first that all things must be done to god glorie corinthian whether ye eate or drinke or what soeuer ye doe doe all to the glorie of god and that this may be performed things indifferent must be vsed as signes and tables in which we may shew forth the graces amp vertues that god hath wrought in the heart for example we must so make our apparrell both for matter and fashion and so weare it that it may in some sort set forth to the beholder our modestie sobrietie frugalitie humilitie ampc that hereby he may be occasioned to say behold a graue sober modest person and so of the rest and the common sinne of this time is that meat drinke apparrell buildings are vsed as banners displaied to set forth to the world mans wit excesse and pride of heart the second we must suffer our selues lawfully to be limited and restrained in the ouer much or ouer common vse of things indifferent i say the ouer common vse because it is not god will vtterly and absolutely to barre vs of the vse of such things now the restrainers of our vse are two the first is the lawe of charitie for as charitie giues place to pietie so christian libertie in the vse of outwarde things giues place to charitie and the law of charitie is that we should not vse things indifferent to the hurt or offence of our brother corinthian question whether may a man vse his libertie before such as are weake and not yet perswaded of their libertie ansvver some are weake of simple ignorance or because they haue beene deceiued by the abuse of long custome and yet are willing to be reformed and before such wee must abstaine least by example we draw them to sinne by giuing occasion to them of doing that whereof they doubt againe some are weake up affected ignorance or of malice and in the presence of such we need not abstaine vpon this ground paul who circumcised timothy would not circumcise titus the second restrainer is the wholesome lawes of man whether ciuill or ecclesiasticall for howsoeuer things indifferent after the law is once made of them remaine still indifferent in themselues yet obedience to the law is necessary and that for conscience sake actes verse the third we must use things indifferent so farre foorth as they shall further us in godlinesse for we ought to doe all things not only to the edification of others but also of our own selues and therefore it is a flat abuse of christian liberty for man so to pamper their body with meate and drinke that thereby they disable themselues to heare god word to pray to giue good counsell to doe the ordinary works of their callings the fourth things indifferent must be used within the compasse of our callings that is according to our ability degree state and condition of life and it is a common abuse of this liberty in our dayes that the meane man will be in meate drinke apparell building as the gentlemans the gentleman as the knight the knight as the lord or earle now then things indifferent are sanctified to vs by the worde when our consciences are resolued out of the word that we may use them so it be in the manner before named and according to the rules here set downe they are sanctified by prayer when wee craue at god handes the right use of them and hauing obtained the same giue him thanks therefore coloss v whatsoever yee doe in worde or deede doe all in the name of our lorde iesus giving thankes to god the father by him thus much of christian liberty by which wee are admonished of sundry duties i to labour to become good members of christ of what estate or condition soeuer we be the liberties of the citie of rome made not onely romanes borne but euen the man of other countreyes seeke to be citizens thereof act the priuiledges of the iewes in persia made many become iewes hest o then much more should the spirituall liberty of conscience purchased by the blood of christ mooue us to seeke for the kingdome of heauen and that we might become good members thereof ii againe by this we are taught to study learne and loue the scriptures in which our liberties are recorded wee make account of our charters wherby we holde our earthly liberties yes wee gladly reade them and acquaint our selues with them what a shame then will it be for vs to make no more account of the word of god that is the law of spirituall liberty iam v iii lastly we are aduertised most heartily to obey and serue god according to his worde for that is the ende of our liberty the servant doeth all his businesse more chearefully in the hope and expectation he hath of liberty againe our liberty most of all appeares in our seruice and obedience because the seruice of god is perfect freedome as on the contrary in the disobedience of god commandements standes our spirituall bondage the second property of conscience is an vnfallible certenty of the pardon of sinne amp life euerlasting that this point may be cleared i will handle the question betweene vs and papistes touching the certenty of saluation and that i may proceede in order we must distinguish the kindes of certenty first of all certenty is either vnfallible or conjecturall vnfallible wherein a man is neuer disappointed conjecturall which is not so euident because it is grounded onely upon likelihoodes the first all papiste but the second they in the matter of saluation againe certenty is either of faith o experimentall which papistes call rall certenty of faith is whereby any thing is certenly beleeued and it is either generall or speciall generall certenty is to beleeue assuredly that the word of god is trueth it selfe and this both wee and papistes allow speciall certenty is by faith to apply the promise of saluation to our selues and to beleeue without doubt that remission of sinnes by christ and life euerlasting belongs unto us this kind of certenty we holde and maintaine and papists with one consent deny it acknowledging no assurance but by hope morall certenty is that which proceedes from sanctification and good workes as signes and tokens of true faith this wee both allowe yet with some difference for they esteeme all certenty that comes by workes to be uncerten and often to deceiue but wee doe otherwise if the workes be done in uprightnesse of heart the question then is whether a man in this life may ordinarily without reuelation be vnfallibly certe of his owne first of all d principally by faith and then secondly by such workes as are unseperable panions of faith we hold this for a cleare amp tudent principle of the ord of god and trariwise the pepists deny it wholly i will pr the trueth by some ewe arg and then answer the common obiections arg t that which the spirit of god doth first of all testifie in the heart and conscience of any n and then afterward fully confirme is to be beleeued of the same man as vnfallibly cert but the spirite of god first of all doeth testifie to some man namely true beleeuers that they are the sonnes of god and afterward confirmes the same unto them therfore man are unfillibly to beleeue their owne adotion now that the spirit of god doth giue this testimony to the conscience of man the scripture is more then plaine rom e have received the spirit of adoption whereby vvee cry a a f ther the same spirit beareth witnes vvith our spirit that we are the sonnes of god answere is made that this testimony of the spirite is giuen onely by an experiment or feeling of an inward delight or peace which breeds in vs not an infallible but a coni cturall certenty and i answere againe that this exposition is flat against the text for the spirit of adoption is said here not to make vs to thinke or speake but to cry abba father and crying to god as to a father argues courage confidence amp boldnesse againe the same spirit of adoption is opposed to the spirit of b dage causing feare amp therefore it must needs be a spirit giuing assurance of liberty amp by that means driuing away distrustfull feares and the end no doubt why the holy ghost comes into the heart as a witnes of adoption is that the truth in this case hidden amp therfore doubtful might be cleared and made manifest if gd himself haue appointed that a doubtfull truth among man shal be confirmed and put out of doubt by the mouth of two or three witnesses it is absurd to thinke that the testimony of god himselfe knowing all things and taking vpon him to be a witnes should be coniecturall s bernard had learned better diuinity when he saide who is iust but he that being loved of god returnes love to him againe which is not done but by the spirit of god ke it well reuealing by faith vnto man the eternall purpose of god concerning his salvation in ti to come which revelation vndoubtedly is nothing else but an of spirituall grace by which whilest the dee es of the flesh are mortified the man is prepared to the kingdome of god receiving withall that vvhereby he may presume that he is loved and loue againe furthermore that the spirit of god doth not only perswade man of their adoption but also con the same unto them it is most manifest ephesians greeve not the spirit whereby yee are s aled vp to the day of redemption and v after ye beleeved ye were sealed with the spi rit of promise which is the earnest of our inheritante corinthian it is god that hath sealed v amp giuen vs the earnest of his spirit in our harts here the words of sealing and carnest are to be considered for things that passe too and fro among man though they be in question ye when the seale is put too they are made out of doubt and therfore when god by his spirite is said to seale the promise in the heart of euery particular beleuer it signifieth that he giues unto them euident assurance that the promise of life belongs unto them and the g ing of earnest is an unfallible token unto him that receiueth it that the bargaine is ratified and that he shall receiue the things agreed upon and it were a great dishonour unto god to that the earnest of his owne spirite giuen vnto vs should be an euidence of eternall life not vnfallible but coniecturall arg the faith of the elect or saving faith is a certen perswasion amp a particular perswasion of remi ion of sinne and life euerlasting touching the first of these wain namely that faith is a certen perswasion yes that cer enty is of the nature of faith it appeares by expresse testimonies of scripture matth o thou of little faith why hast thou doubted and v if ye haue faith and doubt not iam let him aske in faith and wa er not for he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea tost of the winde away rom neither did he doubt of the promise of god through vnbeliefe but was strengthenedin faith i will not stand longer on this point which is not denyed of any touching the second part of my reason that faith is a particular perswasion applying things beleeued i prooue it thus the propertie of faith is to receiue the promise galat and the thing promised which is christ with his spirit ioh now christ is receiued by a particular application as will appeare if we doe t marke the end and use of the ministery of the word and of the sacraments for when god giues any blessing to man it is to be receiued by man as god giueth it now god giues christ or at the least offereth him not generally to mankinde but to the seuerall and particular members of the church in the lord supper as in euery sacrament there is a relation or analogie betwene the outward signes amp the things signified the action of the minister giuing the bread and the wine representeth god action in giuing christ with his benefits to the particular communicants againe the action of receiuing the bread and wine seuerally representeth another spirituall action of the beleeuing heart which applyeth christ unto it selfe for the pardon of sinne and life euerlasting papists yeeld not to this yet if they refuse to maintaine this analogie they ouerturne the sacrament and dissent from antiquity augustine saith the body of christ is ascended into heaven some may answer amp say how shall i hold him being absent how shal i reach vp mine hand to heaven that i may lay hold of him ting there send vp thy faith and thou hast laid hold of him and what is more comon the another saying of his what thou to prepare thy belly and teeth beleeve and thou hast eaten againe ephesians v paul saith by christ we have boldnesse and entr with confidece by faith in him in which words are set downe two notable effects and fruits of faith boldnesse and confidence boldnesse is when a poore sinner dare come into the presence of god not being terrified with the threatnings of the lawe no with the consideration of his owne unworthinesse and with the manifolde assaultes of the deuill and it is more then certenty of god fauour now whereas papistes answere that this liberty of boldnesse in comming unto god proceedes of a generall faith they are farre wide it is not possible that a generall p swasion of the goodnesse and trueth of god and of his mercie in christ should breede confidence and boldnesse in the heart of a guilty and o ple can be brought hereof this generall faith conc s of our b w no doubt in iudas yes in the d him and yet they despaired and some of them away themselues and the d ill for all his before god wherefore that ith which is the roote of these excellent vertues of boldnesse and confidence must need s be a speciall aith that i and plentifull perswasion of the pardon of mans owne sinnes and of life everlasting gaine hebr v faith is called hypost that is a substance or subsistance of things hoped o where faith in the matter of our saluation and other like things is made to goe beyond hopet for hope waites for things to come till they haue a being in the person hoping but faith in present giues a subsisting or being vnto them this can not be that generall faith of papistes tearmed catholike for it comes short of hope but it must needes be a speciall faith that makes us vndoubtedly beleeue our owne election adoption iustification and saluation by christ and to this purpose haue some of the fathers saide excellent well augustine saith i demaund of thee o sinner dost thou beleeve christ or no th i beleeve what beleevest thou that ee can freely forgive thee all thy sinnes thou hast that vvhich thou hast beleeved ambrose saieth this is a thing ordained of god that hee vvhich beleeveth in christ should be saved without any vvorke by faith alone freely receiving remission of sinnes and with ambrose i ioyne the testimony of hesichius vpon leuiticus who saieth god pitying mankinde vvhen hee savve it disabled for the fulfilling of the vvorkes of the lavve vvilled that man shoulde be saved by grace vvithled the vvorkes of the lavve and grace proceeding of mercie is apprehended by faith alone vvithout vvorkes whereas in both these places faith is opposed generally to all workes and is withall saide to apprehende and receiue yes alone to apprehend and receiue grace and remission of sinnes they cannot be understood of a generall but of a speciall applying faith bernard hath these words if thou beleevest that thy sinnes can not be blotted out but by him against whome thou hast sinned thou est well but go yet further amp beleeve that hee pardoneth thy sinnes this is the testimony which the holy ghost giveth in our hearts saying thy sinnes are forgiven thee for so the apostle thinketh that a man is iustified freely by faith papists being much choked with this place make answer that s bernard doeth not say that wee ust beleeue the pardon of our sinnes absolutely without respect of workes but that hee requires the condition of our conversion and repentance as signes whereby this perswasion is wrought i answer againe that hee auoucheth plainly the generall faith whereby the points of religion are beleeued to be but a beginning or udiment of faith and therefore not sufficient vnlesse we goe further and apply the grace of god to our selues by faith simply without respect of any condition perfourmed on mans parte indeede i graunt that the trueth of conversion and other workes are by him mentioned afterwarde but that was for this ende to shewe how any man may haue a sensible and euident experience by workes as fruits of the pardon of his owne sinnes amp life euerlasting which he beleeueth argument s john penned his first epistle that he might shewe unto the church of god a way how they might ordinarily and fully be assured of the loue of god and of eternall life and therefore he affordeth vs many pregnant testimonies for this purpose ioh v and by this we know that we haue knowen him if wee keepe his commandements and v hee which keepes his word in him is the word of god truely accomplished by this vvee know that wee are in him cap by this are manifest the children of god and the children of the devill and v by this vve know that we are of the trueth and before him vvee shall make our hearts confident cap by this we know that we d ll in him and hee in vs because he hath given vs of his spirit cap by this vvee knowe that we love the sonnes of god when we love god and keepe his commandements verse i have written these things vnto you vvhich beleeve in the name of the son of god that yee may knovve that you haue life eternall to these testimonies first of all answere is made that none of them doe necessarily imply a certentie of diuine faith because wee are saide to knowe the thinges which wee lea e by coniectures beholde a y and poore shifte saint john saieth cap verse these things vvee vvrite vnto y that your oy may be full now it is but an uncerten oy that riseth by coniecturall knowledge againe this knowledge brings foorth conscience and bol sse even before god c v and therefore it can not but include an infallible cer en y and to put it out of question that the knowledge here mentioned is the knowledge of divine faith or as un ible as it is or can be it is added cap and vvee have knovvon and beleeved the love vvhich god hath tovvardes vs secondly it is answered that all these speeches are generall and not concerning particular man but it is false for when saint john saieth vve know hee speakes of himselfe and includes the rest of the church in the same condition with himselfe now hee himselfe was fully assured of his owne saluation for christ a little before his departure out of the worlde did comfort all his disciples partly by renewing the promise of life euerlasting and of the presence of his spirite unto them and partly by praying unto the father for their finall preseruation so as they could not but be fully resolued of their happy estate both in this life and in the life to come abrahams faith a whereby hee applyed the promise vnto himselfe rom v and this faith of his is an example propounded unto vs according to which we are to beleeue and therfore hee is called the father of the faithfull r and p l hauing downe the d effectes of his faith saith it vvas onely for him but also for vs vvhich v it is obiected that abrahams faith was not of salvation but it concerned his in his olde age as paul saieth rom v abreham about hope beleeved that the father of many nation according to that vvhich vvas spoken so shall thy see be a svver wee must distinguish the obiect of faith which is either principall or lesse principall principall is alwaies christ with his benefites lesse principall are other lesse and particular benefites obtained by christ as of abrahams faith the obiect lesse principall was a carnall seede or issue and the principall obiect most of all respected as the foundation of all other blessings was the bl seede christ iesus g lat v to abraham and his seede vvere the promises made hee saith not and to the seed as of many but thy eed as of which is christ and v if yee be christs then abrahams seed thu it is plaine that issue was ither promised nor desired but with respect to christ who coulde not haue descended of abraham if he had bene wholly without seed hauing thus alledged some arguments for the trueth i come now to consider the obiections of the papistes obiect i iob beeing a righteous man wanted certenty of grace in himselfe iob v if i vvoulde iustifie my selfe mine evvne mouth shall condem if i vvoulde be perfect he shall iudge me ic ed though i vvere perfect yet my soule shall knovve it againe verse i am afraid of all my workes knovving that thou vvilt not iudge me innocent answer bildad in the former chapter had extolled the iustice of god amp iob in this chapter giues assent thereto saying verse i knovve verely it is so and hee likewise spendes the whole chapter in magnifying the iustice of god and hauing propounded this ende of his speech hee doth not speake of him selfe and his owne estate thus histome vnderstands the chap simply as it is considered it selfe bus as he esteemed himselfe being compared with god specially then when hee entereth into a straight examination of his creature and so must the speach e vnderstoode if my soule should not knovv it that is i will not acknowledge or stand vpon any righteo of mine owne when god shal enter into iudgement with me and thus much the very efect angels beeing in possession of heauen and therefore hauing more then assurance thereof can not but say when they are compared with god againe the words according to the originall are commonly of all and so may well e translated thus am i perfect i know not my soule i horre my life that is if i thinke my selfe perfect i haue no respect of mine owne soule o thus i am perfect in respect of you and i know not my soule and i abhorre my life namely in respect of mine owne vprightnes and the other place is thus to be translated i feare all y sorrowes and not all my works for this is flat against the hebrue text and popish transla s themselues follow it not obiect ecclesiastes c man knowes not whether he be worthy of loue or hatred for al things are kept vncer e till the time to co e answer first i say the translation is not the words are thus in the hebrue and in the seven e no man knoweth loue or hatred all things are before them as for these words all things are vncerten till the time to come are thrust into the text by head and shoulders and hierome hath them not secondly i answer that the h ghost doth not denie s mply the knowledge of god loue or h tred as though there could be certen assurance of it in this life if we vnderstand the words thus then the argument of the holy ghost must be framed on this manner if loue or hatred were to be knowne then it must be knowne by the outward blessings of god but it cannot be knowne by the outward blessings of god for all things come alike to all therefore loue and hatred cannot be knowne the propositio is false for loue may be known other waies then by outward benefits and therefore the reason is not meete to be ascribed to the spirit of truth wherefore the true and proper sense of the words is that loue or hatred cannot be iudged or discerned by outward blessings of god s bernard speaks of this text on this manner that no man knowes loue or hatred namely by himselfe yet that god giues most certen testimonies thereof to man vpon earth and se m de dedi his words are these who knowes if he be worthie loue or hatred who knowes the minde of the lord here both faith amp truth must needs helpe vs that that which is hidden in the heart of the father may be reuealed vnto vs by the spirit and his spirit giuing testimonie persvvades our spirit that we are the sonnes of god and this perswasion is caused by his calling and iustifying vs freely by faith and s hierome though comonly abused to the contrarie saith no more but that man cannot know loue or hatred by the present afflictions which they suffer because they know not whether they suffer them for triall or for punishment obiect corinthian i iudge not my selfe i know nothing by my selfe here paul as not being privic to his own estate refuseth to giue any iudgement of his owne righteousnes answer it is manifest by the words of this epistle that certaine in corinthian boldly more then wisely censured the apostles ministerie and withall disgraced it in respect of the ministery of other teachers therfore paul in this chapter goes about to make an apologie for himselfe speaking nothing of his owne person and the estate thereof before god but onely of his ministerie and the excellencie thereof and this is the iudgement of theodoret aquinas and lira vpon this text and when he saith i iudge not my selfe his meaning is i take not vpon me to iudge of what value and price my ministerie is before god in respect of the ministerie of this or that man but i leaue all to god here then paul refuseth onely to giue iudgement of the excellencie of his owne ministerie and in other cases he refused not to iudge him selfe as when he said i haue fought a good fight i haue kept the faith henceforth is laid vp for me the crowne of righteousnes which the lord the righteous iudge shall giue me tim and chrysostom on this place saith that paul refused to iudge himselfe not simply but onely for this ende that he might restraine others and teach them modestie and where paul saith i know nothing by my selfe the speach is not generall but must be vnderstoode of negligences and offences in the compasse of his ministery for he was priuie to himselfe that in simplicitie and godly purenes he had his conuersation in the world corinthian and he knew this by himselfe that nothing should seuer him from the loue of god in christ rom obiect that we may be iustified there is somewhat required of vs namely faith and repentance and where these are wanting a man cannot be iustified now no man can be certen by the certentie of faith that he repents of his sinnes with all his heart and that he hath such a faith as god requires at our hands considering there is no testimonie in the word of our faith and repentance in particular therefore no man can be certen by certentie of faith that his sinnes are pardoned answer it is not necessarie that any man should be certen by faith of his faith and repentance because faith is onely of such things as are absent where faith and repentance are truly present in all that truly beleeue and rep it shall be sufficient if a man may any way bly certen that he hath them and though ome man falsly perswade themselues that they beleeue yet he that hath true faith indeede knowes that he hath true faith euen as as he that vnderstands knowes that he vnderstands paul saith to the corinthians your s es vvhether ye be in the faith or corinthian hereby giuing them to vnderstand that all which beleeue haue the spirit of discerning to know certenly that they doe beleeue againe he saith of himselfe tim i knowe home i haue be eeued and saint john saith p by this we know that he dwells in vs by the spirit which he hath giuen vs making no question of it but that he which hath the spirit knowes that he hath the same and testimonies of man are not wanting in this case augustine august de t euery one seeth faith to be in his owne heart if he beleeue if not he seeth it to be vvanting againe epistle a beleeuer seeth his o ne faith by which he answereth that he beleeueth without doubt and lib de t c he which leueth his brother more knoweth the leue whereby he eth then his brother whome he loueth againe whereas it is said that hauing faith yet we know not whether it be ficient or no i answear that faith beeing without hypocrifie is sufficient to saluation though it be imperfect god more respects the trueth of our faith then the perfection thereof and as the hand of the child or of the palsie man though it be feeble is able to reach out it selfe and receiue an almes of a prince so the faith that is but weake is able to apprehend and receiue christ with all his benefits obiect prov blessed is the man that feareth alvvaies p l worke your salvation with feare and trembling answer there is a threefold feare one of nature the secod of grace the third of distrust feare of nature is that whereby the nature of man is troubled with any thing that is hurtfull vnto it and therefore auoideth it feare of grace is that excellent gift which is called the beginning of wisdome and it is a certaine awe or r erence vnto god in whose presence we doe whatsoeuer we doe feare of distrust is when man tremble at the iudgemets of god for their sinnes because they haue no hope of mercie of these three the first was good by creation and therfore it was in our sauiour christ but since the fall it is defective the third is a vice called sl ish feare and the second is that which is commaunded in these and the like places of scripture the intent whereof is to make vs circumspect and fearefull least we should offend god by any our owne weaknesse considered and the vineible iudgements of god and this kinde of feare as also the first may stande with c r ntie of faith rom thou standest by faith be not high minded but feare psalm ser e the lord in feare and reioyce in trembling obiect where there is no word there is no faith for faith and the word of god be relatiues but there is no word of god that saith to particular man cornelius or peter or john thy sinnes are pardoned excepting few persons as m magd and the p ampc therefore there is no particular faith ansvv though there be no word set downe in scripture touching the saluation of this or that particular man yet there is set downe that which is equivale to a particular word and as much in effect for the promise of remission of sinnes and life euerlasting is giuen with a comm undement that euery man reade ber d s applie the promise to himselfe as i haue before prooued and this is altogether as much as if euery mans particular name had beene put in the promise i adde further that the promises of the gospel must be considered two waies first as they are generally set downe in scripture without application to any person secondly as they are ght and published in the inisterie of the word the end whereof is to applie them to the persons of man partly by pr ching and p tly administ ing the sacraments of baptisme and the lord supper which are seales of righteo s of faith now the promise applied and as i may say particularized to the members of the church is by the vertue of god ordinance as much as if god himselfe had giuen the promise particularly and dment names vnto it it is further nswered that the promise of remission of sinne is preached not simply but vpo condition of faith amp which be knowne i answer againe i haue alreadie prooued that he which truly beleeueth and rep th knoweth that he doth certenly beleeue and repe t obiect to beleeue the pardon of a mans owne sinnes is one of the articles of faith propounded in any creede either of the apostles or the nice e fathers or athanas s or any other creede answer this faith is contained vnder these words i beleeue remission of s es and i prooue it thus these words are an article of christian faith and therefore they must in sense containe more then the deuill doth or can beleeue nowe the deuill beleeueth thus much that god giues remissio of sinnes to his church christian man therefore must goe one steppe further and beleeue particularly the remission of their owne sinnes otherwise if the papists will haue the catholicke faith to beleeue no more in this point then the damned spirits beleeue let them take it to themselues but they replie further that if there were any such article of faith then some persons must beleeue that they are iust though they willingly commit mortall sinne which is an euident falshood ansvver he that beleeues the pardon of his owne sinnes by true faith hath the spirit of god in him and a constant purpose not to sinne against god and therefore if he sinne it is against his purpose and without any full consent of wil and it is not he that doeth it but the sinne that dwelleth in him but if it so fall our that the child of god be ouertaken with any actual sinne then his case standeth thus he hath by his fall wounded his conscience weakned his faith bereaued himselfe of god fauour as much as in him lieth made himselfe guiltie of a sinne and worthie of damnation and god for his part accordingly turnes the woonted signes of his sauour into signes of anger and displeasure and the sinne though it be pardoned in the purpose of god yet is it not actually pardoned till the partie repent things standing thus we teach not that man must beleeue the pardon of their sinnes while they liue and lie in them for that were tly to teach falshoode for truth but our doctrine is that such persons must first of all humble themselues and say with the prodigall childe that they haue sinned against god and are not worthie to be called his children any more and againe renew their decaied faith and repentance that they may beleeue as before their perfect reconciliation with god obiect in respect of god who is truth it selfe we are to beleeue the promise in particular yet if we respect our owne vnworthines and indisposition we are to feare and in some part to doubt for the promise of remission of sinnes is not absolute but depends vpon the condition of our workes therefore our certentie is onely coniecturall answer i answer first that in respect of our owne vnworthines we are not to doubt of our saluation but to be out of all doubt yes to dispaire before the iudgement seate of god for they which are of the workes of the lawe are vnder he curse gal and paul saith of his owne workes of grace in this am i not iustified corinthian and dauid being out of all doubt of his owne deserued damnation in regard of his owne vnworthines saith freely enter not into indgement with thy servant o lord for no flesh shallbe i stified in thy sight againe the consideration of any vnworthines in our selues doth not hinder a resolution concerning god mercy in christ for true faith makes an entrance vnto god vvith boldnes i say with boldnes euen for those persons that are vnworthy in themselues ephesians and abraham whose faith is to be followed of vs did not vpon the consideration of his olde decaied bodie rest himselfe with bare hope vpon alikelihood of the accomplishment of god promise but he beleeued vnder hope euen against hope rom lastly i answear that the ground of the former obiection is erronious namely that the promise of saluation depends on the condition of our workes because the scripture saith it is made and accomplished on mans part freely i graunt indeede that to the promise there is annexed a condition of faith yet faith here must not be considered as a worke but as an instrument apprehending christ with his benefits and withall epentance with the fruits thereof are on our part required yet no otherwise but as they are necessaric consequents of faith and the signes and documents thereof obiect no man knowes all his sinnes no man therefore can certenly know that all his sinnes are pardoned and that he is accepted of god ansvver the ground of this argument is false namely that a man cannot be assured of the pardon of his sinnes if some of them be vnknowne and to make this manifest i will lay downe a more certen ground which shal be this as the case is in repentance so it is also in faith but there may be true and sufficient repentance of vnknowne sinnes god indeede requires a particular repentance for particular knowne sinnes but if they be hidden and vnknowne he accepts a generall repentance an example wherof we haue in dauid who knows saith se the errours of this life then purge me from my secret s es if this were not so neither dauid nor any man els could be saued for when dauid repented greatly of his murder and adulterie yet we find not that he repented particularly of his polygamie which in all likelihoode through the swinge and custome of those times was not the reputed to be any sinne specially in the person of a king and yet because as we know he is saued this very sinne is pardoned therefore when god pardons the knowne sinnes of man whereof they repent he doth withall pardon the rest that are vnknowne and by this it appeares that the ignorance of some hidden sinnes after a man with diligence hath searched himselfe cannot preiudice an vnfallible assurance of the pardon of them all and of his owne saluation obiect we pray for the pardon of our owne sinnes and therefore we are vncerten of pardon the ma which knows that he hath pardon need not pray for it i answer first when we are taught by christ to pray for the forgiuenes of our debts we are put in mind not to seek the pardon of al our sinnes whether past or present but specially of our present and daily offences whereby we make our selues day by day guilty till such time as we humble our selues and repent of them secondly by this petition we are taught to aske the increase of our assurance because though god bestow endles mercie on vs yet we are s nt in receiuing of it our hearts beeing like a narrow necked vessell which being cast euen into the ocean sea receiueth in water ly droppe by droppe obiect no man can beleeue his owne saluation as he beleeues the articles of faith therefore no man can beleeue the pardon of his innes and his saluation by an infallible certe ie i answer first that euery one that lookes for saluation by christ is bound in conscience as certenly to beleeue his owne saluation and adoption by christ as he beleeues the articles of faith because to the promise of life there is annexed a commandement to beleeue and applie it secondly this faith whereby we are to beleeue our owne saluation if we respect the true and proper nature thereof is as certen as that faith whereby we beleeue the articles of faith thirdly as there be diverse ages in the life of ma so there be diverse degrees and measures of true faith there is first of all a beginning or diment of faith like the smoking flaxe and br isedreede which christ will neither quench no bruise againe there is weake faith which beleeueth the promise truly but yet is perplexed with many doubtings lastly there is strong faith which hath ouercome all doubtings and is not onely for nature certen but also a large amp plentifully perswasio of god mercy in christ exaples of this we haue in ab a a dauid the martyrs amp such like worthie me now by the secod faith man do as certenly beleeue their adoption as the articles but not so amp fully but by the last remission of sinnes is not only as certenly but also as fully beleeued as any article of faith obiect ancient fathers the lights of god church haue alwaies condemned this vn allible amp speciall certentie of saith which the protestant hold and maintaine answer though we build not the doctrine of our religion vpon the indgements of man yet we refuse not in this amp other points to be beied by the fathers whose writings well vnderstoode make more for vs then for the popish religion and their test onies commonly alledged to con te the certentie of speciall faith are much abused i

for then you should not be able to bewaile the same sinnes vii some places denie unto man that certentie which is proper to god which is to discerne in himselfe all things to come plainly as they shal come to passe without helpe of testimonies and outward signes bernard sermon de septuages who can say i am of the elect i am of the predestinate to life certenly we haue none as yet but the affiance of our hope comforteth vs conferre these wordes with those that follow for this cause certaine signes and manifest tokens of salvation are given that it may be a thing out of doubt that he is in the number of the elect in vvhome these signes are thus i haue in some part made manifest that an unfallible certenty of pardon of sinne and life euerlasting is the property of euery renued conscience now therefore i will proceede further to consider how this certenty is caused and imprinted in the conscience the principall agent and beginner thereof is the holy ghost in lightning the minde and conscience with spirituall and diuine light and the instrument in this action is the ministery of the gospell wherby the worde of life is applyed in the name of god to the person of euery hearer and this certentie is by little and little conceiued in a forme of reasoning or practicall syllogisme framed in the mind by the holy ghost on this manner euery one that beleeues is the child of god but i e beleeve therefore i am the child of god the proposition is made by the minister of the worde in the publike congregation and it is nothing else but the promise of eternall life applyed to the particular hearer the second part or the assumption is the voice of conscience regenerate or the voice of god spirite in the same now papistes write and auouch that the assumption is false but the reasons which they use to prooue the same are of small moment first they alledge that many are deceiued in their perswasions thinking they haue that which they haue not i answere againe that many doe falsely presume of god mercy and imagine they haue that faith which they haue not and in all such the assumption is false yet in all them that are chosen to saluation and truely called it is vnfallibly true for such as haue receiued the gift of true faith haue also another gift of discerning whereby they see and know their owne faith it is further obiected that ieremy saieth the heart is deceitfull and vvicked above all things vvho can knovve it but the intent of this place is onely to shew that no man can search his heart to the very bottome to see all and euery want infirmitie and wicked inclination that is therein for originall sinne wherewith the heart of man is tainted is a pronenesse or disposition to all the sinnes that are or may be and though man can not discerue all their sinnes yet many of them are certenly knowen why may not then many of the graces of god be certenly known specially those which be of the principall as faith sanctification repentance againe it is alledged that peter beleeued that he was able to lay downe his life for christs sake and yet indeede was not as the euent declared for when the time came he denyed christ ansvv peter at this time was but weake in faith and hee was much carried away with a confidence of his owne strength which made him speake these wordes of presumption and though he failed in this one particular action yet failed hee not in the principall that is in the perswasion of the pardon of his owne sinnes and of life euerlasting in a word it is certen that many perswade them selues of god mercy and yet are deceiued neuerthelesse all such as doe truly beleeue are not deceiued the holy ghost making them to see that in themselues which by nature they can not discerne as paul signified when he said i speake the truth i lie not my conscience bearing me witnesse by the holy ghost rom v againe the same testimony is giuen otherwise thus euery childe of god hath the pardon of his sinnes saith god word but i am god child and therefore have the pardon of my sinnes saith the renewed conscience by the direction of god spirit rom gal euery childe of god hath the pardon of his sinnes saith god word but i am god child and therefore have the pardon of my sinnes saith the renewed conscience by the direction of god spirit rom gal after that this testimony is once begun it is confirmed by the same meanes as also by prayer and the sacraments now it may be demanded how a bodily element as bread wine water should be able to confirme a perswasion of our adoption that is in the conscience ansvv the element in the sacrament is an outwarde seale or instrument to confirme faith not as a medicine restores and confirmes health whether we thinke on it or not whether we sleepe or wake and that by his owne inherent vertue but by reasoning in syllogisme made by the good conscience the thereof beeing the outwarde signe in the sacrament by means of which syllogisme the holy ghost mooues and stirres the mind yes cherisheth and increaseth faith on this manner hee which vseth the elements aright shall receive the promises but i do or i haue used the elements aright therefore i shall receive the promises whereas presumption and the illusion of satan will as well tell a man that he is the childe of god as the true testimony of regenerate conscience the way to put difference betwene them is this i presumption is naturall and from the very wombe but this testimony of conscience is supernaturall ii presumption is in them that make no account of the ordinarie meanes of saluation this testimony comes by the reuerent and carefull hearing of god worde iii presumption is in them that use not to call on the name of god but this testimony of conscience is ioyned with the spirite of adoption which is the spirite of prayer iv presumption is ioyned with loosenesse of life this testimony brings with it alwayes an happy change and alteration for hee which hath a good conscience hath also care to keepe good conscience in all things v presumption is without doubting wheras the testimony of conscience is mingled with manifold doubtings mark luke yes otherwhiles ouercharged with them psalm vi presumption will giue a man the slippe in the time of sicknesse and in the houre of death and the testimony of good conscience stickes by him to the end and euen makes him say lorde remember now how i haue vvalked before thee in truth and haue done that which is acceptable in thy sight isai the duties of conscience regenerate are two in special maner to giue testimony amp to excuse the speciall thing of which conscience giues testimony is that wee are the children of god predestinate to life euerlasting and that peares by these reasons i rom the of god witnesseth togither with our spirit that wee are the sonnes of god now the spirit of man here mentioned is the mind or conscience renued amp sanctified to this purpose saith john he that beleeueth hath a witnes in himselfe ioh ii that which god spirit doth y to the conscience the coscience can again testifie to vs but god spirit doth s y to the cosciece of a man regenerate that he is the child of god corinthian therefore the conscience also doth the same iii hee which is iustified hath peace of conscience rom v now there can be no peace in conscience till it tell the man which is iustified that he is indeed iustified iv that which the conscience may know certenly it may testifie but conscience may know certenly without revelation the mans election and adoption as i haue before prooued therefore it is able to giue testimony of these againe the regenerate conscience giueth testimony of a certaine kinde of righteousnesse being an unseperable companion thereof and for this cause it is called of some the righteousnesse of a good conscience now this righteousnesse is nothing ls but unfained earnest and constant purpose with endeauour answerable therto not to sinne in any thing but in all things whatsoeuer to please god and doe his wil heb pray for vs for vvee are assured that vve haue good conscience in all thinges de ing to live honestly corinthian our reioycing is this the testimony of our conscience that in s licitie and godly p renesse and not in f eshly wisdome vvee haue bad r conversation in the worlde corinthian i know nothing by my selfe isai lord remember no how i haue walked befor thee with an vpright heart and haue done that which is acceptable in thy sight i adde this clause in all things because that obedience which is the signe or fruite of good conscience of which also it giues testimonie is generall shewing it selfe in all and euery commandement of god philosophers haue saide that iustice is universull because he which hath it hath all vertues but it is more truely saide of this christia righteousnes o new obedience that it is vniuersall and that he which can performe true obedience in one commandement can doe the same in all actcs man and brother i haue in all good conscience se d god till this day psalm then shall i not be confounded when i shall haue respect to all thy comm dements act in the meane season i endeavour my selfe or take pains to have a conscience without offence towards god and des man this shewes that there is a great number of man professing the gospell that want good conscience for though they shewe themselues very forwarde and willing to obey god in many things yet in some one thing or other they will follow the swinge of their owne wills many are diligent to freque the place of god worship to heate the word preached with liking to receiue the sacraments at times appointed amp to approoue of any good thing all this is very comendable yet these man ofred when they depart home from the congregation say in effect on this manner religion stay thou here the church do till the next sabba h for if looke into their priua conuersations the gouernment of their families or their d lings in their particular callings we shall with gre e much disorder and litle conscience it is a common practise of sick man when they make willes on their death beds in the very first place to commend their body to the graue and their soules to god that gaue them in hope of a better resurrection and all this is well done but afterward they b queath their goods gotten by fraud oppression and forged ca illation to their owne friends amp children without making any recompence or satisfaction but alas this should not be so for obedience that goes with good conscience must be performed to all god commandements without exception and if if it be done but to some alone it is but counterfeit obed ce amp he that is guilty in one is guilty in all as regenerate conscience giues testimony of our new obedience so it doeth also by certaine sweet motios stirr man forward to perform the same psalm my reines that is the mind and conscience inlightned by the spirit of god teach me in the night season isai and thi res shall heare a d behind th saying this is the way walk ye it when thou to the right hand amp thou t rnest to the le t now this word is not only the voice of s ors amp teachen in the open ministery but also the voice of r ed conscience inwardly by many secret gitations s ibb them that are about to sinne a christian ma is not only a priest amp a prophet but also a spirituall king euen in this life and the lord in mercy hath vouchsafed him this honor that his conscience ed within him shall be his solli r to put him in mind of all his and duties which hee is to per to god yes it is the controller to see all things kept in order in the heart which is the and habitation of the holy ghost the second office of conscience generate is to excuse that is to eare amp defend a man euen before god against all his enemy both bodily and ghostly psalm iudge thou o lord according to my righteousnes amp according to mine i ie in me again iudge me o lord for i have walked in mine ampc prooue me o lord and me me examine and my heart that the conscience can do this specially appeares in the conflict amp combat made by it against the deuill on this maner the deuill begins and disputes thus thou o wretched man article a most grieuous sinner therefore thou article but a damned wretch the conscience answereth and saith i know that christ hath made a satisfaction for my sinnes and freed me from damnation the deuill replyeth againe thus though christ haue freed thee from death by his death yet thou article quite barred from heauen because thou neuerr did st fulfill the lawe the conscience answereth i knowe that christ is my righteousnesse and hath fulfilled the lawe for me thirdly the deuill replies and saith christs benefites belong not to thee thou article but an hypocrite and wantest faith now when a man is driuen to this straight it is neither wit nor learning nor fauour nor honour that can repulse this temptation but onely the poore conscience directed and sanctified by the spirit of god which boldly and constantly answereth i know that i beleeve and though it be the office of conscience it is once d principally to excuse yet doth it also in part accuse when dauid had d the people his heart s him sam iob faith in his affliction that god write bitter things against him amp him poss sse the s nnes of his youth iob the reason hereof is because the whole man and the very conscience is onely in part regenerate and therefore in some part remaines still corrupt n ther must it seeme strange that one and the ame conscience should both accuse and excuse because it doth it not in one and the same resp i excuseth in that it assureth a man that his person standes righteous before god and that he hath an indeauour in the generall course of his life to please god it accuseth him for his particular slippes and for the wants that be in his good actions if any shall demaund why god doth not perfectly regenerate the conscience and cause it only to excuse the answere is this god doth it for the preventing of greater mischiefes when the israelites came into the land of canaan the canani s were not at the first wholly displaced why moses rendreth the reason least wilde beast come and inhabite some parts of the land that were dispeopled and more annoy them then the cananites in like maner god renues the conscience but so as it shall still accuse when occasion serueth for the preuenting of many dangerous sinnes which like wild beastes would make hauock of the soule thus much of good conscience now followes euill conscience and it is so called partly because it is defiled and corrupted by originall sinne and partly because it is euill that is troublesome amp painfull in our sense amp feeling as all sorrows calamities amp miseries are which for this very cause also are called evil and though coscience be thus termed evil yet hath it some respects of generall goodnes in s much as it is an instrument of the execution of diuine iustice because it seemes to accuse them before god which are iustly to be accused it hath spred it selfe ouer mankind as generally as originall sinne amp therfore it is to be found in all man that come of adam by ordinary generation the property of it is with all the power it hath to accuse amp condemne amp therby to make a man afraid of the presence of god amp to cause him to flie fro god as from an enemy this the lord signified when he said to ada a where article thou when peter saw some litle glimbring of the power and maiesty of god in the great draught of fish he fell on his knees and saide to christ lord goe from me for i am a sinfull man euill conscience is either deade or stirring dead conscience is that which though it can do nothing but accuse yet commonly it lye quiet accusing litle or nothing at all the causes why conscience lyeth dead in all man either more or lesse are many i defect of reason or understanding in crased braines ii violence and strength of affections which as a cloud do ouercast the mind ampc as a gulfe of water swallow up the iudgement and reason and therby hinder the conscience from accusing for when reason can not doe his part then conscience doth nothing for exaple some one in his rage behaues himselfe like a mad man and willingly commits any mischiefe without controlment of conscience but when choller is down he begins to be ashamed and troubled in himselfe not alwaies by grace but euen by the force of his naturall conscience which when affection is calmed begins to stirre as appeareth in the example of cain iii ignorance of god will amp errors in iudgement cause the conscience to be quiet when it ought to accuse this we find by experience in the death of obstinate hercukes which suffer for their damnable opinions without checke of conscience dead conscience hath two degrees the first is the slumbring or the benummed conscience the second is the feared conscience the benummed conscience is that which doth not accuse a man for any sinne vnlesse it be grieuous or capitall amp not alwaies for that but only in the time of some grievous sickenesse or calamity iosephs brother were not much troubled in conscience for their villany in selling their brother till afterwarde when they were afflicted with famine and distressed in egypt geues this is the conscience that commonly raignes in the hearts of drousie protestant of all carnall and lukewarme gospellers and of such as are commonly tearmed ciuill honest man whose apparent integritie will not free them from guiltie consciences such a conscience is to be taken heede of as being most dangerous it is like a wilde beast which so long as hee lyes a sleepe seemes very ame and gentle and hurtes no man but when he is rowzed he then awakes and flies in a mans face and offers to pull out his throate and so it is the manner of dead conscience to lye still and quiet euen through the course of a mans life and hereupon a man would thinke as most do that it were a good conscience indeed but whe sicknesse or death approcheth it beeing awaked by the hande of god beginnes to stande up on his legges and shewes his fierce eyes and offers to rende out euen the very throate of the soule and heathen poets knowing this right well haue compared euill conscience to furies pursuing man with firebrands the seared conscience is that which doeth not accuse for any sinne no not for great sinnes it is compared by paul tim v to the parte of a mans body which is not onely berefe of sense life amp motion by the gangrene but also is burnt with a searing iron and therefore must needes be vtterly past all feeling this kind of conscience is not in al man but in such persons as are become obstinate heretikes and notorious malefactours and it is not in the by nature but by an increase of the corruption of nature and that by certaine steppes and degrees for naturally euery man hath in him blindnes of minde and obstinacie or froward nes of heart yet so as with the blindnes and ig norance of minde are ioyned some remnants of the light of nature shewing vs what is good and euill now the heart of man beeing exceedingly obstinate and peruerse carrieth him to commit sinnes euen against the light of nature and common conscience by practise of such sinnes the light of nature is extinguished and then commeth the reprobate mi which iudgeth euill good and good euill after this follows the seared conscience in which there is no feeling or remorse and after this comes an exceeding greedines to all manner of sinne ephesians rom here it may be demaunded how mens consciences shall accuse them in the day of iudgement if they be thus benummed and seared in this life ansvver it is said reverand that at the last iudgement all shall be brought before christ and that the bookes then shall be opened among these bookes no doubt conscience is one wherefore though a dead conscience in this life be as a closed or sealed booke because it doeth either little or nothing accuse yet after this life it shall be as a booke laide open because god shall inlighten it and so stirre it vp by his mightie power that it shall be able to reueale and discouer all the sinnes that a man euer committed stirring conscience is that which doth sensibly either accuse or excuse and it hath soure differences the first which accuseth a man for doing euill this must needes be an euill conscience because to accuse is not a property that belongs to it by creation but a defect that followeth after the fall and if the conscience which truely accuseth a man for his sinnes were a good conscience then the worst man that is might haue a good conscience which cannot be when the accusation of the conscience is more forcible and violent it is called a wounded or troubled conscience which though of it selfe it be not good nor any grace of god yet by the goodnes of god it serueth often to be an occasion or preparation to grace as a needle that drawes the threede into the cloath is some meanes whereby the cloath is sowed together the second is that which th for doing well and it is to be found in them that are giuen to idolatry and superstition as in the church of rome in which because mens consciences are insnared and intangled with humane traditions many are troubled for doing that which is good in it selfe or at the least a thing indifferent as for example let a priest omit to say masse amp to say his canonicall houres his conscience will accuse him therfore though the omitting of the canonicall houres and the idolatrous masse be indeede by god word no sinne the third is the conscience which excuseth for doing that which is euill this also is to be found in them that are giuen to idolatry and superstition and there is a particular example hereof ioh yes the time shall come that vvhosoeuer killeth you will thinke that he doth god good seruice such is the conscience of popish traytours in these daies that are neuer touched at all though they intend and enterprise horrible villanies and be put to death therefore the fourth is that which excuseth for well doing at some times and in some particular actions of carnall man vvhen abim h had taken sarai from abraham god saide vnto him in a dreame i knovv that thou did this with an vpright minde gen this may be tearmed sed in mala good conscience but is indeede otherwise for though it doe truly excuse in one particular action yet because the man in whome it is may be vnregenerate and as yet out of christ and because it doth accuse in many other matters therefore it is no good conscience if all the vertues of naturall man are indeede s beautifull sinnes and their righteousnes but a carnall righteousnes then the conscience also of a carnall man though it excuse him for well doing is but a carnall conscience mans dutie concerning conscience is twofold the first is if he want good conscience aboue all things to labour to obtaine it for it is not giuen by nature to any man but comes by grace for the obtaining of good conscience three things must be procured a preparation to good conscience the applying of the remedie the reformation of conscience in the preparation foure things are required the first is the knowledge of the lawe and the particular commaundements thereof whereby we are taught what is good what is badde what may be done and what may not be done the man of our daies that they may haue the right knowledge of the law must lay aside many erronious and foolish opinions which they hold flat against the true meaning of the law of god otherwise they can neuer be able to discerne betweene sinne and no sinne their especiall and common opinions are these i that they can loue god with all their hearts and their neighbours as themselues that they feare god aboue all and trust in him alone and that they euer did so ii that to rehearse the lordes prayer the beleefe and commaundements without vnderstanding of the words amp without affection is the true and whole worship of god iii that a man may seeke to wizzards and soothsayers without offences because god hath prouided a salue for euery sore iv that to sweare by good things and in the way of truth cannot be a sinne v that a man going about his ordinarie affaires at home or abroad on the sabbath day may as well serue god as they which heare all the sermons in the world vi that religion and the practise thereof is nothing but an affected precisenes that couetousnes the roote of euill is nothing but worldlines that pride is nothing but a care of honestie and cleanlines that single fornication is nothing but the tricke of youth that swearing and blaspheming argue the couragious mind of a braue gentleman vii that a man may doe with his owne what he will and make as much of it as he can hence arise all the frauds and badde practises in traffic betweene man and man the second is the knowledge of the iudiciall sentence of the law which resolutely pronounceth that a curse is due to man for euery sinne gal very few are resolued of the truth of this point and very few doe vnfainedly beleeue it because mens minds are possessed with a contrarie opinion that though they sinne against god yet they shall escape death and damnation dauid saith the wicked man that is euery man naturally blesseth himselfe psalm amp he maketh a league with hell and death isai v this appeareth also by experience let the ministers of the gospel reprooue sinne amp denounce god iudgements against it according to the rule of god word yet man wil not feare stones will almost as soone mooue in the walls and the pillers of our churches as the hearts of man and the reason hereof is because their minds are forest lled with this absurd conceit that they are not in danger of the wrath of god though they o end and the opinion of our common people is hereunto answerable who thinke that if they haue a good meaning amp doe no man hu god will haue them excused both in this life and in the day of iudgement the third is a iust and serious examination of the conscience by the lawe that we may see what is our estate before god and this is a duty vpon which the prophets stande very much lam man suffereth for sinne let us search and trie our hearts and turne againe to the lord zeph fanne your selues fanne you o nation not vvorthie to be loued in making examination we must specially take notice of that which doth now lie or may hereafter lie vpon the conscience and after examination hath beene made a man comes o a knowledge of his sinnes in particular and of his wretched and miserable estate when one enters into his house at midnight he findes or sees nothing out of order but let him come in the day time when the shineth and he shall then p many faults in the house and the very motes that flie vp and downe so let a man search his heart in the ignorance amp blindnes of his minde he will straightway thinke all is well but let him once begin to search himselfe with the light and lanterne of the law and he shall sinde many foule corners in his heart and many heapes of sinnes in his life the fourth is a sorrovv in respect of the punishment of sinne arising of the three former actios and though this sorrow be no grace for it befalls as well the wicked as the godly yet may it be an occasion of grace because by the apprehension of god anger we come to the apprehension of his mercie and it is better that conscience should pricke vs and wound vs and doe his worst against vs in this life while remedie may be had then after this life when remedy is past thus much of preparation now follows the remedie and the application of it the remedie is nothing else but the bloode or the merits of christ who specially in conscience felt the wrath of god as when he said my soule is heavy vnto death and his agonie was not so much a paine and torment in bodie as the apprehension of the feare and anger of god in conscience and when the holy ghost saith that he offered vnto god praiers with strong cries and was heard fro feare he directly notes the distresse and anguish of his most holy conscience for our sinnes and as the blood of christ is an all sufficient remedy so is it also the alone remedie of all the sores and wounds of conscience for nothing can stanch or stay the terrours of conscience but the blood of the immaculate lambe of god nothing can satisfie the iudgement of the conscience much lesse the most seuere iudgement of god but the onely satisfaction of christ in the application of the remedie two things are required the gospel preached and saith the gospell is the hand of god that offereth grace to vs and faith is our hand whereby we receiue it that we indeede by faith receiue christ with all his benefits we must put in practise two lessons the first is vnfainedly to humble our selues before god for all our wants breaches and wounds in conscience which beeing vnto vs as a paradise of god by our default we haue made as it were a little hell within vs this humiliation is the beginning of all grace and religion pride and good conscience can neuer goe together and such as haue knowledge in religion and many other good gifts without humilitie are but vnbridled vnmortified and vnreformed persons this humiliation containes in it two duties the first is confession of our sinnes especially of those that lie vpon our consciences wherwith must be ioyned the accusing and condemning of our selues for then we put conscience out of office amp dispatch that labour before our god in this life which conscience would performe to our eternall damnation after this life the second dutie is deprecation which is a kind of praier made with grones and desires of heart in which we intreat for nothing but for pardon of our sinnes and that for christs sake till such time as the conscience be pacified to this humiliation standing on these two parts excellent promises of grace and life euerlasting are made prov he that hideth his sinnes shall not prosper but he that confesseth amp for saketh the shall find mercy ioh if we acknowledge our sinnes he is faithfull amp iust to forgiue vs our sinnes amp to clense vs fro all vnrighteousnes luke he hath filled the ugrie with good things amp sent the rich emptie away which are also verified by experience in sundrie examples sam dauid said to nathan i have sinned against the lord and nathan saide to dauid the lord also hath put away thy sinne chr when manasses was in tribulation he praied to the lord his god and humbled himselfe greatly before the god of his fathers and prayed vnto him and god heard his prayer luke and the thiefe said to iesus lord remember me vvhen thou commest to thy kingdome then iesus saide vnto him verely i say to thee to day shalt thou be with me in paradise by these and many other places it appeares that when a man doth truly humble himselfe before god he is at that instant reconciled to god and hath the pardon of his sinnes in heauen amp shall afterward haue the assurance thereof in his own coscience the second lesson is when we are touched in conscience for our sinnes not to yeeld to natural doubtings and distrust but to resist the same and to indeauour by god grace to resolue our selues that the promises of saluation by christ belong to vs particularly because to doe thus much is the very commandement of god the third thing is the reformtion of conscience which is when it doth cease to accuse and terrifie and begins to excuse and testifie vnto vs by the holy ghost that we are the children of god amp haue the pardon of our sinnes and this it will doe after that man haue seriously humbled themselues and praied earnestly and constantly with sighes and grones of spirit for recociliation with god in christ for then the lord will sende downe his spirit into the conscience by a sweete and heauenly testimonie to assure that we are at peace with god thus we see how good conscience is gotten and because it is so pretious a iewell i wish all persons that as yet neuer laboured to get good conscience now to beginne reasons to induce man thereto may be these i you seeke day and night from yere to yere for honours riches and pleasures which ye must leaue behinde you much more threfore ought you to seeke for renewed and reformed consciences considering that conscience will be with you in this life in death at the last iudgement and for euer ii he which wants a conscience purged in the blood of christ can neuer haue any true and lasting comfort in this life suppose a man araied in cloath of tishue set in a chaire of estate before him a table furnished with all daintie prouision his servant monarches and princes his riches the chiefest treasures amp kingdoms of the world but withall suppose one standing by with a naked sword to cut his throat or a wild beast readie euer and anon to pull him in pieces nowe what can we say of this mans estate but that all his happines is nothing but woe and miserie and such is the estate of all man that abounding with riches honours and pleasures carrie about them an euill conscience which is as a sword to lay the soule or as a rauenous beast readie to sucke the blood of the soule and to rend it in pieces iii he which wants good conscience can doe nothing but sinne his very eating and drink his sleeping and waking amp al he doth turnes to sinne the coscience must first be good before the action can be good if the roote be corrupt the fruits are answerable iv an euill conscience is the greatest enemie a man ca haue because it doth execute all the parts of iudgement against him it is the lord sergeant god neede not send out processe by any of his creatures for man the conscience within man will arrest him and bring him before god it is the gayler to keepe man in prison in bolts amp irons that he may be forth comming at the day of iudgement it is the witnes to accuse him the iudge to condemne him the hangman to execute him and the flashings of the fire of hell to torment him againe it makes a man to be an enemie to god because it accuseth him to god and makes him flie from god as adam did whe he had sinned also it makes a man to be his owne enemie in that it doth cause him to lay violent hands vpon himselfe and become his owne hangman or his owne cut throat and on the contrarie a good conscience is a mans best friend when all man intreat him hardly it wil speak faire and comfort him it is a continual feast and a paradise vpon earth v the scripture sheweth that they which neuer seeke for good cosci ce haue terrible ends for either they die blocks as nabal did or they die desperate as cain saul achitophel iudas vi we must consider often the terrible day of iudgement in which euery man must receiue according to his doings and that we may then be absolued the best way is to seeke for a good conscience for if our conscience be euill and condemne vs in this life god will much more condemne vs and wheras we must passe through three iudgemets the iudgement of man the iudgemet of our coscience amp the last iudgement of god we shal neuer be strengthened against them and cleared in them all but by the seeking of a good coscience after that man hath got good conscience his second dutie is to keepe it and as in gouerning the shippe on the sea the pilot holding the helme in his hand hath alwaies an eye to the compasse so we likewise in the ordering of our liues and conuersations must alwaies haue a speciall regard to the conscience that we may keepe good conscience we must doe two things auoide the impediments thereof and vse conuement preseruatiues impediments of good conscience are either in vs or forth of vs in vs on owne sinnes and corruptions when mens body lie deade in the earth there breed certaine wormes in them whereby they are consumed for of the flesh come the wormes which consume the flesh but vnles we take great heed out of the sinns amp corruptions of our hearts there wil breed a worme a thousand folde more terrible euen the worme of conscience that neuer dieth which wil in a lingering maner wast the conscience the soule amp the whole man because he shal be alwaies dying amp neuer dead these sinnes are specially three ignorance vnmortified affectios worldly lusts touching the first namely ignorance it is a great and vsuall impediment of good conscience for when the minde erreth or misconceiueth it doth mislead the conscience and deceiue the whole man the way to auoide this impediment is to doe our indeauour that we may daily increase in the knowledge of the word of god that it may dwell in vs plentifully to this ende we must pray with dauid that he would open our eyes that we might vnderstand the wonders of his law and withall we must daily search the scriptures for vnderstanding as man vse to search the mines of the earth for gold ore prov lastly we must labour for spiritual wisedo that we may haue the right vse of god word in euery particular actio that being by it directed we may discerne what we may with good conscience do or leaue vndone the second impediment is vnsta ed and vnmortified affections which if they may haue their swinge as wild horse ouerturne the chariot with man and all so they ouerturne amp ouer carrie the iudgement amp conscience of man and therfore when they beare rule good coscience takes no place now to preuent the danger that comes hereby this course must be followed when we would haue a sword or a knife not to hurt our selues or others we turne the edge of it and so that we may preuent our affections from hurting and annoying the conscience we must turne the course of them by directing them from our neighbours to our selues amp our owne sinnes or by inclining them to god and christ example choller and anger directs it selfe vpon euery occasion against our neighbour and thereby greatly indamageth the conscience now the course of it is turned when we begin to be displeased and to be angry with our selues for our owne sinnes our loue set vpon the world is hurtfull to the conscience but when we once begin to set our loue on god in christ and to loue the blood of christ aboue all the world then contrariwise it is a furtherance of good conscience the third impediment is worldly lustes that is the loue and exceeding desire of riches honors pleasures euery man is as adam his good conscience is his paradise the forbidden fruite is the strong desire of these earthly things the serpent is the olde e my the deuill who is hee may be suffered to intangle us with the loue of the world will straight way put us out of out paradise and barre vs from all good conscience the remedy is to learne the lesson of paul philip which is in euery estate in which god shall place vs to be content esteeming euermore the present condition the best for us of all now that this lesson may be learned wee must further labour to be resolued of god speciall prouidence towards vs in euery case and condition of life and when we haue so well profited in the schoole of christ that we can see and acknowledge god providence and goodnesse as well in sicknesse as in health in pouerty as in wealth in hunger as in fulnes in life as in death we shall be very well content whatsoeuer any way befalls unto us the preseruatiues of good conscience are two the first is to preserue and cherish that sa g faith whereby we are perswaded of our reconciliation with god in christ for this is the roote of good conscience as hath bene shewed now this faith is cherished and confirmed by the daily exercises of inuocation and repentace which be to humble our selues to bewaile and to confesse our sinnes to god to condemne our selues for them to pray for pardon amp strength against sinne to praise god amp giue him thanks for his daily benefits now by the unfained amp serious practise of these duties repentance and faith are daily renued and confirmed the second preseruatiue is the maintaining of the righteousnesse of a good conscience which righteousnesse as i haue said is nothing els but a constant endeauor and desire to obey the will of god in all things that this righteousnesse may be kept to the end we must practise three rules the first is that wee are to carry in our hearts conse bo non at proposi peccandi a purpose neuer to sinne against god in any thing for where a purpose is of committing any sinne wittingly and willingly there is neither good faith nor good conscience the second is to walke with god as enoch did genes v which is to order the whole course of our liues as in the presence of god desiring to approoue all our doings euen unto him now this perswasion that wheresoeuer we are we do stand in the presence of god is a notable meanes to maintaine sinceritie genes v i am god all sufficient vvalke before me and be perfect and the want of this is the occasion of many offences as abraham saide because i thought surely the feare of god is not in this place they will slay me for my wiues sake gen the third rule is carefully to walke in our particular callings doing the duties therof to the glory of god to the good of the common wealth and the edification of the church auoiding therein fraud covetousnesse and ambition which cause man oftentimes to set their consciences on the tenters and make them stretch like cheverill thus we see how good conscience may be preserued reasons to induce vs hereunto are many i god straight commandement tim v keepe faith and good conscience and prover keepe thine heart vvith all dili gence ii the good conscience is the most tender part of the soule like to the apple of the eye which beeing pearced by the least pinne that may be is not onely blemished but also looseth his sight therefore as god doeth to the eye so must wee deale with the conscience god giues to the eye certaine liddes of flesh to defende and couer it from outwarde iniuries and so must wee vse meanes to auoide whatsoeuer may offend or annoy conscience iii manifold benefits redound vnto us by keeping good conscience first so long as we haue care to keepe it we keepe and enioy all other gifts of god spirit good conscience and the rest of god graces are as a paire of turtle dowes when the one feeds the other feedeth when the one likes not the other likes not when the one dies the other dies so where good conscience is maintained there are many other excellent giftes of god flourishing and where conscience decayes they also decay againe good conscience giues alacrity vnto vs amp boldnesse in calling on god name ioh if our heart condemne vs not we have boldnesse towardes god thirdly it makes vs patient in affliction and comforts vs greatly and when by reason of the grievousnesse of our affliction we are constrained to kneele on both knees amp take up our crosse regenerate conscience as a sweete companion layes too his shoulder and helpes to beare one end of it lastly when none can comfort vs it will be an amiable comforter and a friend speaking sweetely vnto vs in the very agony and pang of death iv not to preserue the conscience without spot is the way to desperation it is the pollicie of the deuill to vse meanes to cast the conscience into the sleepe of security that he may the more easily bring man to his owne destruction for as diseases if they be long neglected become incurable so the coscience much and often wounded admitts no comfort neither will it alwaies boote a man after many yeres to say at the last cast lord be mercifull to me i haue sinned though some be receiued to mercy in the time of death yet farre more perish in desperation that liued in their sinnes wittingly amp willingly against their owne conscience pharao saul and iudas cried all peccavi i haue sinned against god yet pharao is hardened more amp more amp perisheth saul goeth on in his sinnes and despaireth iudas made away him selfe and no maruell for the multitude of sinnes oppresse the conscience and make the heart to ouerflowe with such a measure of griefe that it can fasten no affiance in the mercy of god lastly they that shall neglect to keepe good conscience procure many hurtes and dangers and iudgements of god to themselues when a ship is on the sea if it be not well gouerned or if there be a breach made into it it drawes water and sinkes and so both man and wares and all in likelihood are cast away now we all are as passengers the worlde is an huge sea through which we must passe our shippe is the conscience of euery man tim amp the wares are our religion and saluation and all other giftes of god therefore it stands vs in hand to be alwaies at the helme and to carry our ship with as even a course as possibly we can to the entended port of happinesse which is the saluation of our soules but if so be it we grow carelesse and make breaches into the shippe of conscience by suffering it to dash upon the rockes of sinne it is a thousand to one that we in the end shall cast away our selues and all we haue and in the meane season as conscience decayes so proportionally all grace and goodnesse goes from vs god commaundements begin to be vile unto vs the knowledge thereof as also faith hope and the invocation of god name decay experience sheweth that man of excellent giftes through the vsing of bad conscience lose them all

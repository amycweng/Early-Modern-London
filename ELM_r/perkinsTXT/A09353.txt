the bodie of scripture is a doctrine sufficient to liue well it comprehendeth many holy sciences wherof one is principall others are handmaids or retainers the principall science is theologie theologie is the science of liuing blessedly for euer blessed life consisteth in the knowledge of god ioh this is life eternall that they know thee to be the only very god and whom thou hast sent iesus christ esay by his knowledge shall my righteous servant viz christ iustifie many and therfore it consisteth likewise in the knowledge of our selues because we know god by looking into our selues god is iehouah elohim exod and elohim spake vnto moses and saide vnto him i am iehouah and i appeared vnto abraham to isaac and to iaacob by the name of god almightie but by my name iehouah was i not knowen vnto them exod if they say vnto me what is his name what shall i says vnto them and god answered moses i am that i am also he said thus shalt thou say vnto the children of israel i am hath sent me vnto you and god spake further to moses thus shalt thou saye vnto the children of israel iehouah elohim ampc hath sent me vnto you the first title of god declareth his nature the second his persons the nature of god is his liuely and most perfect essence the perfection of the nature of god is his absolute constitution by the which he is wholye complete within himselfe exod i am that i am act god that made the worlde and all thinges that are therein seeing that he is lord of heauen and earth dwelleth not in temples made with handes neyther is worshipped with mens handes as though he needed any thing seeing he giueth to all life amp breath and all things the perfection of his nature is either the simplenes or the infinitenes thereof the simplenes of his nature is that by which he is voide of all logicall relation he hath not in him subiect or adiunct ioh as the father hath life in himselfe so hath he giuen to the son to haue life in him selfe conferred with ioh i am the way the trueth and the life ioh but if we walk in light as he is in light conferred with the god is light amp in him is no darknes hence it is manifest that to haue life and to be life to be in light and to be light in god are all one neither is god subiect to generalitie or specialitie whole or partes matter or that which is made of matter for so ther shold be in god diverse things and one more perfect then another therfore whatsoeuer is in god is his essence and all that he is he is by his essence hence it is manifest that the nature of god is immutable and spirituall god immutabilitie of nature is that by which he is void of all composition diuision and change iam with god there is no variablenes nor shadow of changing mal i am the lord and am not changed god nature is spiritual in that it is corporal and therefore inuisible ioh god is a spirite corinthian the lord is the spirite tim to the king eternall immortall inuisible only wise god be glorye and honour for euer and euer coloss who is the image of the inuisible god the infinitenes of god is two folde his eternitie and exceeding greatnes god eternitie is that by which he is without beginning and ending psalm before the mountains were made and before thou hadst formed the earth and the round worlde euen from euerlasting to euerlasting thou article our god revelation i am alpha and omega that is the beginning and ending saith the lord which is which was and which is to come god exceeding greatnes is that by which his incomprehensible nature is euerye where present both within and without the worlde psalm great is the lord amp worthy to be praised and his greatnes is incomprehensible king is it true indeede that god will dwell on the earth beholde the heauens and the heauens of heauens are not able to containe thee how much lesse is this house that i haue built iere doo not i fill the heauen and earth saith the lord hence it is plaine firste that he is onelye one and indivisible not many ephe one lord one faith one baptisme one god and father of all deut vnto thee it was shewed that thou mightest know that the lord he is god and that there is none but he alone corinthian we know that an idole is nothing in the worlde and that there is none other god but one and there can be but one thing infinite in nature secondly that god is the knower of the heart for nothing is hidden from that nature which is within al things and without all things which is included in nothing nor excluded from anye thing because king the lord searcheth all hearts and vnderstandeth euery woork of the minde psalm thou knowest my sitting downe and my rising vp thou vnderstandest my cogitation a farre off hitherto haue we spoken of the perfection of god nature now followeth the life of god by which the diuine nature is in perpetuall action liuing and mouing it selfe psalm my soule thirsteth for god euen for the liuing god when shal i come and appeare before the presence of god heb see that there be not at any time in any of you an euill hart to depart from the liuing god the deuine nature is especiallye in perpetuall operation by three attributes the which doo manifest the operation of god towardes his creatures these are his wisedome will and omnipotencie the wisedome or knowledge of god is that by the which god dooth not successiuelye and by discourse of reason but by one eternall and immutable act of vnderstanding distinctlye and perfectlye know himselfe and al other things though infinite whether they haue bene or not math no man knoweth the son but the father nor the father but the son and he to whome the son will reueale him heb there is nothing created which is not manifest in his sight but all things are naked and open to his eyes with whome we haue to doo psalm his wisdome is infinite god wisedome hath these partes his foreknowledge and his counsell the foreknowledge of god is that by which he most assuredly foreseeth all thinges that are to come act him haue ye taken by the handes of the wicked being deliuered by the determinate counsell and foreknowledge of god and haue crucified and slain rom those which he knew before he also predestinated to be made like to the image of his son this is not properly spoken of god but by reason of man to whom things are past or to come the counsell of god is that by which he doth most straightlye perceiue the best reason of all things that are pro i haue counsell amp wisedome i am vnderstanding and i haue shrength the will of god is that by the which he both most freely and straitly with one act willeth all thinges rom he hath mercie on whom he will and whom he will he hardeneth ephesians who hath predestinate vs to be adopted through iesus christ vnto himselfe according to the good pleasure of his will iam for that which you should say if the lord will we will liue and doe this or that god willeth that which is good by approuing it that which is euill in as much as it is euill by disalowing and not willing it and yet he voluntarily doth permit euill because it is good that there should be euill act who in times past suffered all the gentils to walke in their owne waies psalm so i gaue them vp to the hardnes of their heart and they haue walked in their owne counsels the will of god by reason of diverse obiectes hath diverse names and is either called loue and hatred or grace and iustice the loue of god is that by the which god approueth first himselfe and then all his creatures without their desert amp in them doth take delight ioh god is loue and who so remaineth in loue remaineth in god and god in him ioh so god loued the world that he gaue his onely begotten son ampc rom god setteth out his loue toward vs seeing that while we were yet sinners christ died for vs the hatred of god is that by the which he disliketh and detesteth his creature offending for his fault corinthian but manie of them the lord misliked for they perished in the wildernes psalm thou hatest all the workers of iniquitie psalm thou hast loued iustice and hated iniquitie the grace of god is that by which hee freely declareth his fauour to his creatures rom if it be of grace it is no more of workes otherwise grace is not grace but if it be of workes it is no more grace titus the sauing grace of god shined to all man teaching vs to dente impietie ampc the grace of god is eyther his goodnesse or his mercie the goodnesse of god is that by which he being in himselfe absolutely good doth freely exercise his liberalitie vpon his creatures matth why callest thou me good none is good but one euen god matth he maketh his sun to shine vpon the good and the bad and he raineth vpon the iust and vniust god mercie is that by which he freely assisteth all his creatures in their miseries esay yet will the lord waite that he may haue mercie vpon you leuit it is the lordes mercies that we are not consumed because his compassion faile not exod i take pitie on whom i take pitie and am mercifull on whom i am mercifull god iustice is that by which he in all thinges willeth that which is iust psalm the iust lord loueth iustice psalm for thou article not a god that loueth wickednesse god iustice is in word or deede iustice in word is that truth by which he constantly amp indeede willeth that which he hath said rom let god be true amp euery man a lyar mat vp children to abraham philipp according to the working wherby he is able to subdue euen all things vnto himselfe god actuall power is that by which he causeth all things to be which he freely will psalm all things which god will those be doth in heauen and in earth and in all depthes ovt of the former attributes by which the true iehouah is distinguished from a fained god and from idoles arise the glorye of god and his blessednes god glorie or maiestie is the infinite excellencie of his most simple and most holye diuine nature heb who being the brightnes of his glorye and the ingraued forme of his person ampc daniel thou lord article only god and glorious vpon the earth by this we see that god onely can knowe him selfe perfectly john not that any man hath seene the father saue he which is of god he hath seene the father tim who only hath immortalitie and dwelleth in the light that none can attaine vnto whome neuer man sawe neither can see exod thou canst not see my face notwithstanding there is a certaine manifestation of god glorie partlye more obscure partlye more apparant the more obscure manifestation is the vision of god maiestie in this life by the eyes of the minde through the helpe of thinges perceiued by the outward sences esai i saw the lord sitting vpon an high throne and lifted vp and the lower partes thereof filled the temple exod and while my glorye passeth by i will put thee in a cleft of the rocke and will couer thee with mine hands while j passe by after j wil take away mine hand and thou shalt see my backeparts but my face shall not be seene corinthian now we see as through a glasse darkely the more apparant manifestation of god is the contemplation of him in heauen face to face corinthian but then shall we see face to face daniel i behelde till the thrones were set vp and the ancient of dayes did sit whose garment was white as snowe ampc god blessednes is that by which god is in himselfe and of him selfe all sufficient gen i am god all sufficient walke before me and be thou vpright column for in him dwelleth all the fulnes of the godhead bodily tim which in due time he shall shew that is blessed and prince onely ampc the persons are they which subsisting in one godhead are distinguished by incommunicable properties john there are three that beare recorde in heauen the father the worde and the holye ghoast and these are one gen then jehouah rained vpon sodome and vpon gomorah brimstone and fire from jehouah in heauen ioh jn the beginning was the word and the word was with god and that word was god the constitution of a person is when as a personall proprietie or the proper manner of subsisting is adioyned to the deitie or one diuine nature distinction of persons is that which albeit euery person is one and the same perfect god yet the father is not the son or the holye ghost but the father alone the son is not the father or the holy ghost but the son alone and the holy ghoast is not the father or the son but the holy ghoast alone so that in these there is diuersitie of persons but vnitie of essence the communion of the persons or rather vnion is that by which eche one is in the rest and with the rest by reason of the vnitie of the godhead and therefore euerye eche one doth possesse loue and glorifie another and work the same thing ioh beleeuest thou not that j am in the father and the father is in me the wordes that i speak vnto you j speake not of my selfe but my father that dwelleth in me he doth the workes pro the lord hath possessed me in the beginning of his way j was before his workes of olde and verse then was j with him as a nourisher and j was dayly his delight reioycing alwaye before him ioh jn the beginning was the word amp the word was with god and that word was god amp chap the son can doo nothing of himselfe saue that he seeth the father doo for whatsoeuer things he doth the same doth the son also there be three persons the father the son and the holy ghost math and iesus when he was baptized came straight out of the water and loe the heauens were opened vnto him and john saw the spirite of god discending like a doue and lighting vpon him and loe a voice came from heauen saying this is my beloued son in whom i am well pleased the father is a person without beginning who from all eternitie begate the son heb who being the brightnesse of the glorie and the ingraued forme of his person psalm thou article my son this daye haue i begotten thee the incommunicable propertie of the father is to be vnbegotten he is the beginning of actions because he beginneth euery action of himselfe effecting it by the son amp the holy ghost corinthian yet vnto vs there is but one god which is the father of whome are all things and we in him and one lord iesus christ by whome are all thinges and we by him rom for of him and through him and for him are all things the other two persons haue the godhead or the whole diuine essence of the father by communication namely the son and the holy ghost the son is the second person begotten of the father from all eternitie heb for vnto which of the angels said he at any time thou article my son this day begat i thee column who is the age of the inuisible god the first borne of euery creature ioh and we saw the glorie therof as the glory of the onely begotten son of the father rom he who spared not his owne son for this cause he is saide to be sent from the father ioh i proceeded forth and came from god neither came i of my selfe but he sent me this sending taketh not away the equalitie of essence and power but declareth the order of the persons ioh therefore the iewes sought the more to kill him not only because he had broken the sabaoth but said also that god was his father and made himself equall with god philipp who being in the forme of god thought is no robbery to be equall with god for this cause also he is the word of the father not a vanishing but an essentiall woord because as a word is as it were begotten of the minde so is the son begotten of the father and also because he bringeth glad tidinges from the bosome of his father nazian in his oration of the son basil in his preface before iohns gospell the propertie of the son is to be begotten his proper manner of working is to execute actions from the father by the holy ghost corinthian our lord jesus christ by whome are all things and we by him ioh whatsoeuer things he dooth the same doth the son also the holy ghost is the third person proceeding from the father and the son ioh but whe the comforter shall come whom i wil send vnto you from the father euen the spirite of trueth which proceedeth of the father he shall testifie of me rom but ye are not in the flesh but in the spirite seeing the spirite of god dwelleth in you but if there be any that hath not the spirite of christ he is not his ioh but when that spirite of trueth shall come he shall conduct you into all trueth for he shall not speake of himselfe but whatsoeuer he heareth he shall speake and shall declare vnto you such thinges as are to come he shall glorifie me for he shall receiue of mine and shew it vnto you what may be the essentiall difference betwixte proceeding and begetting neither the scriptures determine nor the church knoweth the incommunicable propertie of the holye ghost is to proceede his proper manner of woorking is to finish an action effecting it as from the father amp the son thus far concerning the first part of theologie the second followeth of the works of god the works of god are all those which he doth out of himselfe that is out of his diuine essence these are common to the trinitie alwaies reserued the peculier maner of working in euery person the end of all these is the manifestation of the glorie of god rom for him are all thinges to him be all glory for euer the woorke of action of god is either his decree or the execution of his decree the decree of god is that by which god in himself hath necessarily and yet freelye from all eternitie determined all things ephe jn whome also we are chosen when we were predestinate according to the purpose of him which woorketh all thinges after the counsell of his own will and ver as he hath chosen vs in him before the foundation of the world math are not two sparrowes solde for a farthing and not one of them falleth on the ground without your father rom hath not the potter power on the claie to make of the same lumpe one vessell to dishonor and another to ho er therefore the lord according to his good pleasure hath most certainly decreed euery both thing and action whether past present or to come together with their circumstances of place time means and end y be hath most iustlye decreede the wicked workes of the wicked for if it had not so pleased him they had neuer been at all and albeit they of their owne nature are and remaine wicked yet in respect of god decree they are to be accounted good for there is not anyething absolutelye euill pet for it is better if the wil of god be so that ye suffer for well dooing then for euill dooing the thing which in the one nature is euill in god eternall counsell comes in the place of a good thing in that it is some occasion amp way to manifest the glory of god in his iustice and in his mercie the execution of god decree is that by which all thinges in their time are accomplished which were foreknowen or decreed amp that euen as they were foreknowen and decreed the same decree of god is the first amp principall working cause of al things which is in order amp time before all other causes for with god decree is alwaies his will annexed by the which he can willinglye effect that he hath decreede and it were a signe of impotencie to decree anye thing which he could not willingly compasse and with god will is coioyned an effectuall power by which the lord can bring to passe whatsoeuer he hath frely decreed this first and principall cause how be it in it selfe it be necessary yet it doth not take away freedome of will in election or the nature and propertie of second causes but only brings them into a certain order that is it directeth the to the determinate end wherupon the effects and euents of things are contingent or necessarye as the nature of the second cause is so christ according to his fathers decree died necessarily act but yet willinglye mat and if we respect the teperature of christs body he might haue prolonged his life amp therfore in this respect might be said to haue died cotingetly the execution of god decree hath two braunches his operation and his operatiue permission god operation is his effectuall producing of al good things which either haue being or mouing or which are done god operatiue permission is that by which he only permitteth one and the same work to be done of others as it is euill but as it is good he effectually worketh the same gen you indeed had purposed euill against me but god decreed that for good that he might as he hath doon this day preserue his people aliue and gen god hath sent me before you to preserue your posteritie in this land esay woe vnto asshur the rod of my wrath and the staffe in their handes is mine indignation i will send him to a dissembling nation and i will giue him a charge against the people of y wrath to take the spoyle and to take the praye and to tread them vnder feete like the mire in the street but he thinketh not so neither doth his hart esteeme it so but he imagineth to destroy and to cut off not a fewe nation god permitteth euill by a certain voluntary permission in that he forsaketh the second cause in working evil and he forsaketh his creature either by detracting the grace he had or not bestowing that which he wanteth rom for this cause god gaue them vp vnto vile affections tim instructing them with meeknes that are contrary minded prouing if god at any time wil giue the repentance that they may know the trueth and that they may come to amendment out of the snare of the deuill which are taken of him at his will neither must we think god vniust who is indebted to none rom i will haue mercy on him to whome i will shewe mercie yes it is in god pleasure to bestowe how much grace and vpon whom he will math is it not lawful for me to doo as i will with mine own that which is euill hath some respect of goodnes with god first in that it is the punishment of sinne and punishment is accounted a morrall good in that it is the parte of a iust iudge to punish sinne secondly as it is a meere action oract thirdlye as it is a chastisement a triall of ones faith martirdome propitiation for sinne as the death and passion of christ act amp and if we obserue these caueates god is not onelye a bare permissiue agent in an euill worke but a powerfull effect or of the same yet so as he neither instilleth an aberration into the action nor yet supporteth or intendeth the same but that he most freely suffereth euill and best disposeth of it to his owne glory the like we may see in this similitude let a man spurre forward a lame horse in that he moueth forward the rider is the cause but that he halteth he himselfe is the cause and again we see the sun beames gathering themselues into a sun glasse they burne such thinges as they light vpon now that they burne the cause is not in the sun but in the glasse the like may be saide of god action in an euill subiect god decree in as much as it concerneth man is called predestination which is the decree of god by the which he hath ordeined all man to a certain and euerlasting estate that is either to saluation or condemnation for his own glory thes for god hath not appointed vs vnto wrath but to obtaine saluation by the meanes of our lord iesus christ rom as it is written i haue loued jacob amp hated esais and ver what and if god would to shewe his wrath and make his power knowne suffer with long patience the vessels of wrath prepared to destruction and that he might declare the riches of his glorye vpon the vessels of mercy which he hath prepared vnto glory the meanes of accomplishing god predestination are two folde the creation and the fall the creation is that by which god made all things very good of nothing that is of no matter which was before the creation gen in the beginning god created the heauen ampc to the end of the chap god manner of creating as also of gouerning is such as that by his woord alone he without any instrumentes meanes assistance or motion produced all sortes of thinges for to will any thing with god is both to be able and to performe it heb by faith we vnderstand that the worlde was ordeined by the word of god so that the thinges which we see are not made of things which did appeere psalm let them praise the name of the lord for he commaunded and they were created the goodnes of the creature is a kinde of excellencie by which it was voide of all sinne that is free from punishment and transgression the creation is of the world or inhabitantes in the world the world is a most beautifull pallace framed out of a deformed substace and fit to be inhabited the parts of the world are the heauens and earth the heauens are threefolde the first is the aire the second the skye the third an inuisible and incorporall essence created to be the seate of all the blessed both man and angels this third heauen is called paradise corinthian the inhabitant of the worlde are reasonable creatures made according to god owne image they are either angels or man gen furthermore god saide let vs make man in our owne image according to our likenesse iob when the children of god came and stoode before the lorde satan came also among them the image of god is the integritie of the reasonable creature resembling god in holinesse ephesians and put on the new man which after god is created in righteousnesse and true holinesse the angels ech of them being created in the beginning were setled in an vpright estate in whom these thinges are to be noted first their nature angels are spirituall and incorporall essences heb for be in no sort tooke the angels but he tooke the seede of abraham heb and of the angels he saith he maketh the spirite his messengers amp his ministers a flame of fire secondly their qualities first they are wise sam my lord the king is eue at an ell of god in h aring good and bad they are of great might thess when the lord iesus shall sh himselfe from heauen with his mightie angels sam dauid sawe the angell that smote the people king the same night the angell of the lorde want out and smote in the campe of asshur an hundreth fourscore and fiue thousand they are swift and of great agelitie esay then flew one of the seraphius vnto me with an hote cole in his hand daniel the man gabriell whom i had seene before in a vision came flying and touched me this is the reason why the cherubims in the tabernacle were painted with winges thirdly they are innumerable gen nowe iacob went forth on his iourney and the angels of god met him daniel thousand thousands ministred vnto him and ten thousand thousandes stoode before him matth thinkest thou i cannot pray to my father and he will giue me me then twelue legions of angels heb to the copanie of innumerable angels fourthly they are in the highest heauen where they euer attend vpon god and haue societie with him matth in heauen their angels alwaies behold the face of my father which is in heauen psalm the charets of god are twentie thousand thousande angels and the lord is among them mark but are as angels in heauen fiftly their degree that there are degrees of angels it is most plaine coloss by him were all things created which are in heauen amp in earth things visible and inuisible whether they be thrones or dominions or principality or powers rom neither angels nor principality nor powers ampc thess the lord shal descend with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet of god but it is not for vs to search who or how many be of ech order neither ought we curiously to enquire howe they are distinguished whether in essence or qualities colos let no man at his pleasure beare rule ouer you by humblenesse of minde and worshipping of angels aduauncing himselfe in those thinges which he neuer saw sixtly their office their office is partly to magnifie god and partly to performe his commaundements to them psalm prayse the lorde ye his angels that excell in strength that doe his commaundement in obeying the voyce of his worde praise the lorde all ye his hostes ye his servant that doe his pleasure seuenthly the establishing of some angels in that integritie in which they were created man after he was created of god was established in an excellent estate of innocencie in this estate seuen thinges are chiefely to be regarded i the place the garden of heden that most pleasant garden gen then the lord tooke the man and put him into the garden of heden ii the integritie of mans nature which was ephesian created in righteousnes and true holines this integritie hath two partes the first is wisedome which is a true and perfect knowledg of god amp of his will in as much as it is to be performed of man yes and of the counsaile of god in all his creatures column and haue put on the newe man which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him gen when the lord god had formed of the earth euerie beast of the field and euery foule of the heauen he brought them vnto the man to see how he would cal the for howsoeuer the man called the liuing creature so was the name thereof to second is iustice which is a conformitie of the will affections and powers of the bodie to the will of god iii mans dignitie consisting of foure partes first his communion with god by which as god reioyced in his owne image so likewise man was incensed to loue god this is apparant by god familiar conference with adam gen and god sayd behold i haue giuen vnto you euerie herbe bearing seede ampc that shall be to you for meate secondly his dominion ouer all the creatures of the earth gen ps thou hast made him lord ouer the workes of thine handes and hast set all thinges vnder his feete ampc thirdly the decencie and dignitie of the bodie in which though naked nothing was vnseemely psalm thou hast made him little lower then god and crowned him with glorie and worshippe gen they were both naked and neither ashamed corinthian vpon those members of the bodie which we thinke most vnhonest put wee more honestie and our vncomely artes haue more comelinesse on fourthly labour of the bodie without paine or griefe gen because thou hast obeyed the voyce of thy wife ampc cursed is the earth for thy sake in sorrow shalt thou eate of it all the daies of thy life ampc iiii subiection to god whereby man was bound to performe obedience to the commaundementes of god which were two the one was concerning the two trees the other the obseruation of the sabboth god commaundement concerning the trees was ordeined to make examination and triall of mans obedience it consisteth of two partes the first is the eating of the tree of life that as a signe it might confirme to man his perpetuall abode in the garden of heden if still he persisted in obedience revelation to him that ouercometh will i giue to eate of the tree of life which is in the middest of the paradise of god prou she is a tree of life to them which lay holde on her and blessed is he that retaineth her the second is the prohibition to eate of the tree of the knowledge of good and euill together with a commination of temporal amp eternall death after the transgression of this commaundement gen of the tree of knowledge of good and euill thou shalt not eate of it for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt die the death this was a signe of death and had his name of the euent because the obseruation thereof would haue brought perpetuall happinesse as the violation gaue experience of euill that is of all miserie that is of punishment and of guiltinesse of sinne god commaundement concerning the obseruation of the sabboth is that by which god ordained the sanctification of the sabboth gen god blessed the seuenth day and sanctified it v his calling which is his seruice of god in the obseruation of his commaundements and the dressing of the garden of heden prou god made all thinges for him selfe gen he placed him in the garden of heden to dresse and keepe it vi his diet was the herbes of the earth and fruit of euery tree except the tree of the knowledg of good and euill gen and god sayd behold i haue giuen vnto you euery herbe bearing seede which is vpon all the earth and euery tree wherein is the fruite of a tree bearing seede that shall be to you for meate and but of the tree of knowledge of good and euill thou shalt not eate vii his free choice both to will and performe the commaundement concerning the two trees and also to neglect amp violate the same wherby we see that our first parents were indeede created perfect but mutable for so it pleased god to prepare a way to the execution of his decree the fall is a reuolting of the reasonable creature from obedience to sinne sinne is the corruption or rather depriuation of the first integritie more plainely it is a falling or turning from god binding the offendor by the course of god iustice to vndergoe the punishment the fall was effected on this manner first god created his reasonable creatures good indeede but withall changeable as we haue shewed before for to be vnchangeably good is proper to god alone secondly god tryed their obedience in those things about whi h they were conuersant deut thou shalt not hearken to the wordes of the prophet or vnto that dreamer of dreames for the lord your god prooueth you to knowe whether you loue the lord your god with all your heart and with all your soule thirdly in this tryall god dooth not assist them with new grace to stande but for iust causes forsaketh them lastly after god hath forsaken them and left them to themselues they fall quite from god no otherwise then when a man staying vp a staffe from the ground it standeth vpright but if he neuer so little withdrawe his hande it falleth of it selfe the fall is of man and angels the fall of angels that is by which the vnderstanding pointing at a more excellent estate and of it owne accord approouing the same together with the will making especial choyce therof they albeit they might freely by their integritie haue chosen the contrarie were the sole instruments of their fall from god pet if god spared not the angels which sinned but cast them downe into hell amp deliuered them into chaines of darkenes to be kept vnto damnation ampc iude the angels which kept not their first estate but left their owne habitation he hath reserued in euerlasting chaines ampc ioh he was a murtherer from the beginning and continued not in the truth for there is no truth in him in the fall of angels consider first their corruption arising from their fall which is the deprauation of their nature and is eyther that fearefull malice and hatred by which they set them selues against god or their insatiable desire to destroy mankinde to the effecting whereof they neglect neither force nor fraude ioh he that committeth sinne is of the deuill because the deuill sinned from the beginning for this cause was the son of god reuealed to dissolue the workes of the deuill pet your aduersarie the deuill goeth about like a roaring lyon seeking whom he may deuour ephesian you striue not against flesh and bloud but against principality and power and worldly gouernours the princes of darkenesse of this world against spirituall wickednesses which are in supercelestiall thinges ii their degree and diuersitie for of these angels one is chiefe and the rest attendants the chiefe is beelzebub prince of the rest of the devil and the world farre aboue them all in malice matth away from me ye cursed into euerlasting fire prepared for the deuill and his angels corinthian whose mindes the god of this world hath blinded revelation and there was war in heauen michael and his angels fought with the dragon and the dragon and his angels fought ministring angels are such as waite vpon the deuill in accomplishing his wickednesse iii their punishment god after their fall gaue them ouer to perpetuall tormentes without any hope of pardon iude ver pet god spared not the angels that had sinned but cast them downe into hell and deliuered them into chaines of darkenesse to be kept vnto damnation this he did first to admonish man what great punishment they deserued secondly to shew that grieuous sinnes must more grieuously be punished the fall of angels was the more grieuous because both their nature was more able to resist and the deuill was the first founder of sinne their punishment is easier or more grieuous their easier punishment is double the first is their deiection from heauen pet god cast the angels that sinned into hell the seconde is the abridging and limitation of their power iob the lord sayd vnto satan behold all that he hath i in thine hande only vpon him lay not thine hand the more grieuous paine is that torment in the deepe which is endlesse and infinite in time and measure luke and they besought him that he would not commaund them to go downe into the deepe adams fall was his willing reuolting to disobedience by eating the forbidden ate in adams fall we may note the manner greatnesse and fruit of it i the manner of adams fall was on this sort first the death hauing immediatly before fallen him selfe insinuateth vnto our first parents that both the punishment for eating the forbidden fruit was vncertaine and that god was not true in his word vnto them secondly by his legerdemaine he blinded the eyes of their vnderstanding thirdly being thus blinded they begin to distrust god amp to doubt of god fauour fourthly they thus doubting are moued to be hold the forbidden fruite fiftly they no sooner so the beautie therof but they desire it sixtly that they may satisfie their desire they eate of the fruit which by the hands of the woman was taken from the tree by which act they become vtterly disloyall to god gen thus without constraint they willingly fall fro their integritie god vpon iust causes leauing them to themselues and freely suffered them to fall for wee must not thinke that mans fall was either by chaunce or god not knowing it or barely winking at it or by his bare permission or against his will but rather miraculously not without the will of god but yet without all approbation of it ii the greatnes of this transgression must be esteemed not by the externall obiect or the basenesse of an apple but by the offence it contayneth against god maiestie this offence appeareth by many trespasses committed in that action the first is doubting of god word want of fayth for they beleeue not god threatning in the day ye eate thereof you shall die the death but being bewitched with the devil promise ye shalbe like god they cease to feare god punishment and are inflamed with a desire of greater dignitie their curiositie in forsaking god word and seeking other wisedome their pride in seeking to magnifie themselues and to become like god contempt of god in transgressing his comandement against their owne conscience in that they preferre the deuill before god ingratitude who in as much as in them lyeth expell god spirite dwelling in them and despise that blessed vnion they murther both them selues and their progenie iii the fruite or effectes out of this corrupt estate of our first parents arose the estate of vnbeliefe whereby god hath included all man vnder sinne that he might manifest his mercy in the saluation of some and his iustice in condemnation of others rom god hath shut vp all man in vnbeliefe that he might haue mercie on all gal the scripture hath concluded all vnder sinne that the promise by the faith of iesus christ should be giuen to them that beleeue in this estate we must consider sinne and the punishment of sinne sinne is threefolde the first is the participatio of adams both transgression and guiltinesse whereby in his sinne all his posteritie sinned rom as by one man sinne entred into the world and by sinne death so death entred vpon all man in that all man haue sinned the reason of this is readie adam was not then a priuate man but represented all mankinde and therefore looke what good he receiued from god or euill elsewhere both were common to others with him corinthian as in adam all man die so in christ all man rise againe againe when adam offended his posteritie was in his loynes from whom they should by the course of nature issue and therefore take part of the guiltinesse with him heb and to say as the thing is leu ampc payde tythes amp abraham for he was yet in the loines of his father abraham when melchi sedec met him ovt of the former transgression ariseth another namely original sinne which is corruption ingendred in our first conception whereby euery facultie of soule and bodie is prone and disposed to euill ps i was borne in iniquitie and in sinne hath my mother conceiued me gen tit we our selues were in times past vnrise disobedient deceiued serued the lustes and diverse pleasures liuing in maliciousnesse and envy hatefull and hating one another heb let vs cast away euery thing that presseth downe and the sinne that hangeth so fast on by this we see that sinne is not a corruption of mans substance but onely of faculties otherwise neither could mens soules be immortal nor christ take vpon him mans nature the propagation of sinne from the parents to the children is either because the soule is infected by the contagion of the body as a good ointment by a fustie vessell or because god in the very moment of creation amp infusion of soules into infants doth vtterly forsake them for as adam receiued the image of god both for himselfe and others so did he loose it from himselfe and others that we may the better know originall sinne in the seuerall faculties of mans nature three circumstances must be considered i in the minde the remnant of god image is certaine motions concerning good amp euill as that there is a god and that the same god punisheth transgressions that there is an euerlasting life that we must reuerence our superiors and not harme our neighbour but euen these motions they are both seuerall and corrupt and haue none other vse but to bereaue man of all excuse before god iudgement seat rom that which may be knowen concerning god is manifest in them for god hath shewed it vnto them for the inuisible thinges of him that is his eternal power and godhead are seene by the creation of the world being considered in his workes to the intent they should be without excuse mens minds receiued from adam ignorance namely a want or rather a depriuation of knowledge in the things of god whether they concerne his sincere worship or eternall happines corinthian the natural ma perceiueth not the things of the spirit of god for they are foolishnes vnto him nether can he knew the because they are spiritually discerned rom the wisedome of the flesh is enimitie with god for it is not subiect to the law of god neither indeed can be ii impotencie whereby the mind of it selfe is vnable to vnderstand spiritual things though they be taught luke then opened he their vnderstanding that they might vnderstand the scriptures corinthian not that we are sufficiet of our selues to think any thing as of our selues but our sufficiencie is of god iii vanitie in that the mind thinketh falshood truth and truth falshood ephesians walke no more as other gentils in the vanitie of your vnderstanding corinthian it pleased god by the foolishnes of preaching to saue those which beleeue we preach christ crucified to the iewes a stumbling blocke but to the grecians foolishnes prou there is a way which seemeth good in the eies of me but the end therof is death iv a naturall inclination only to conceiue amp deuise the thing which is euill gen the lorde saw that the wickednesse of man was great vpon earth and al the imaginations of the thoughts of the hart were onely euill continually ier they are wise to doe euill but to doe well they haue no knowledge hence it is apparant that the originall and as i may say the matter of all heresies is naturally engraffed in mans nature this is worthy the obseruation of students in diuinitie the increase of sinne in the vnderstanding is i reprobate sense when god withdraweth the light of nature ioh he hath blinded their eyes amp hardened their hearts least they should see with their eies and vnderstand with their harts and i should heale them and they be conuerted rom as they regarded not to know god so god deliuered them vp vnto are probate minde to do those things which are not conuenient ii the spirit of slumber rom god hath giuen them the spirit of slumber ampc iii a spirituall drunkennesse esay they we drunken but not with wine they stagger but not by strong drinke iiii strong illusions thess god shall sende them strong illusions and they shall beleeue lies the remnant of god image in the conscience is an obseruing and watchfull power like the eye of a keeper reserued in man partly to reprooue and partly to represse the vnbrideled course of his affections rom which shew the effect of the lawe written in their heartes their conscience also bearing witnesse and their thoughts accusing one another or excusing that which the conscience hath receiued of adam is the impurenesse thereof tit to them that are defiled and vnbeleeuing nothing is pure but euen their mindes and consciences are defiled this impuritie hath three effectes the first is to excuse sinne as if a man serue god outwardly hee will excuse and cloake his inwarde impietie ma thou knowest the commaundemente thou shalt not ampc then be answered and sayd master all these things haue i obserued from my youth againe it excuseth intents not warranted in god worde chro when they came to the threshing floore of chi en vzza put fo rth his hande to holde the arke for the oxe did shake i the second is to accuse and terrifie for dooing good this we may see in superstitious idolaters who are grieued whe they omit to performe counterfaite and idolatrous worship to their god column touch not taste not handle not which all perish with vsing and are after the commandements and doctrines of man esay and their feare towarde was taught them by the precept of man the third is to accuse and terrifie for sinne gen when iosephs brother sawe that their father was dead they saide it may be that joseph will hate vs and well ay vs againe all the euill which we did vnto him ioh and when they heard it being accused by their owne consciences they went out one by one ioh jf our heart condemne vs god is greater then our heart though the conscience shall accuse a man truely yet that will not argue any holinesse in it which appeareth in that adam in his innocencie had a god yet no accusing conscience impurenesse increased in the conscience is first such a senselesse numnesse as that it can hardly accuse a man of sinne ephesian who being past feeling haue giuen themselues to wantonnesse to worke all vnleannesse euen with greedines tim hauing their consciences burned with an hoat iron this sen from a custome in sinning sam thou in the morning when the wine was gone out of nabal his wife tolde him those woordes and his hart died within him and he was like a stone ii some greeuous horror and terror of the conscience gen beholde thou hast cast me this day from the earth and from thy face shall i be hid amp verse my punishment is greater then i can beare the symptomes of this disease are blasphemies trembling of body fearefull dreames actes and as he disputed of righteousnes and temperance and the iudgement to come felix trembled ampc daniel then the kinges countenance was chaunged and his thoughts troubled him so that the ioyntes of his loines were loosed and his knees smot one against the other in the will the remnant of god image is a free choyce first in euerye naturall action belonging to eche liuing creature as to nourish to engender to moue to perceiue secondly in euerye humane action that is such as belong to all man and therfore man hath free will in outward actions whether they concerne manners a familie or the common wealth albeit both in the choice and refusall of the it be very weak rom the gentiles which haue not the lawe by nature doo those things which are of the lawe the will receiued i an impotencie wherby it cannot will or so much as lust after that which is indeed good that is which may please amp be acceptable to god corinthian the naturall man perc ueth not the things of the spirite of god for they are foolishnes vnto him neither can he knowe them be they are spiritually discerned rom christ when we were yet of no strength at his time dyed for the vngodlye tim philipp it is god which woorketh in you both the will and the deed euen of his good pleasure ii an inward rebellion wherby it vtterly abhorreth that which is good desiring and willing that alone which is euill by this it appeareth that the will is no agent but a meere patient in the firste acte of conuersion to god and that by it selfe it can neither begin that conuersion or any other inward and sound obedience due to god law that which the affections receiue is a disorder by which they therefore are not well affected because they eschewe that which is good and pursue that which is euill galat they that are christs haue crucified the flesh with their affections and lustes thereof rom therfore god gaue them ouer to filthy lustes king the king of israell saide vnto iehosophat yet is there one of whome thou maiest take counsel but him i hate ampc and therfore achab came home to his house discontented and angrie for the word which naboth spake vnto him and he laid himselfe on his bed turning away his face least he should eat meat that which the body hath receiued is i fitnes to begin sinne this doth the body in transporting all obiects and occasions of sinne to the soule gen the woman seeing that the tree was good for meat and pleasant to the eyes ampc tooke of the fruit therof and did eate ii a fitnes to execute sinne so soone as the heart hath begun it rom neither giue your members as weapons of iniustice to sinne and ver as you haue giuen your members as seruantes to vncleannes and iniquitie to commit iniquity ampc after originall sinne in adams posteritie actual transgression taketh place it is either inwarde or outward inward is of the minde will and affection the actuall sinne of the minde is the evil thought or intent therof contrary to god law examples of evil thoughts god the onlye knower of the hart hath in diverse places set down in his word i that there is no god psalme the wicked is so proud that he seeketh not for god he thinketh alwaies there is no god psalm the foole saith in his hart there is no god ii that there is neither prouidence nor presence of god in the worlde plal he hath said in his hart god hath forgotten he hideth his face amp will neuer see ver wherefore dooth the wicked contemne god he saith in his hart thou wilt not regarde iii it imagineth safegarde to it selfe from all perrils psalm he saith in his hart i shall neuer be moued nor be in danger revelation she saith in her hart i sit being a queene and am no widow and shall see no mourning iiii it esteemeth it selfe more excellent then others apocrypha j sit as a queen luke the pharisie standing thus praied to himselfe i thanke thee o god that i am not as other man extertioners vniust adulterers nor yet as this publican ver i fast twise in the weeke and giue tithe of all my possessions ver that the gospell of god kingdome is meere foolishnes corinthian the naturall man perceiueth not the things of the spirite of god for they are foolishnes vnto him vi to think vncharitably and maliciouslye of such as serue god sincerelye mat when the pharises heard that they saide he casteth not out devil but by the prince of devil psalm they saide in their hartes let vs destroye them altogither vii to thinke the day of death farre off esay ye haue saide we haue made a couenant with death and with hell we are at agreement though a scourge runne ouer and passe through it shall not come at vs viii that the paines of hell may be eschewed in the place before mentioned they say with hell haue we made agreement ix that god will deferre his both perticular and last generall comming to iudgement luke i will saye vnto my soule soule thou hast much goods laide vp for many yeeres and ver if that servant say in his hart my maister will deferre his comming ampc many carnal man pretend their good meaning but when god openeth their eyes they shall see these rebellious thoughts rising in their mindes as sparcles out of a chimney the actuall sinne of both will and affections is euery wicked motion inclination and desire gal the flesh lusteth against the spirite an actual outward sinne is that to the committing wherof the members of the bodye doo together with the faculties of the soule concurre such sinnes as these are infinite psalm innumerable troubles haue compassed me my sinnes haue taken such holde vpon me that i am not able to look vp yes they are oe in number then the haires of mine head actuall sinne is of omission or commission againe both these are in wordes or deeds in the sinne of commission obserue these two pointes the degrees in committing a sin and the differences of sinnes committed the degrees are in number iam euery man is tempted when he is drawne away by his owne concupiscence and is entised then when lust hath conceiued it bringeth foorth sinne and sinne when it is finished bringeth foorth death the firste degree is temptation whereby man is allured to sinne this dooth sathan by offer to the minde that which is euill john the dead had now put into the hart of iudas iscariot simons son to betray him act peter saide to ananias why hath sathan filled thine hart that thou shouldst chro and sathan stood in against israell and prouoked dauid to number israell this also is effected vpon occasion of some externall obiect which the sences perceiue iob i haue made a couenan with mine eyes why then should i look vpon a maide tentation hath two partes abstraction and inescation abstraction is the firste cogitation of committing sinne whereby the minde is with drawne from god seruice to the which it shoulde be alwaies readye prest luke thou shalt loue the lord thy god with all thy hart and all thy soule with all thy thought inescation is that wherby an euill thought conceiued and for a time retained in the minde by delighting the will and affections doth as it were lay a baite for them to draw them to consent the second degree is conception which is nothing else but a consent and resolution to commit sinne psalm he shall trauaile with wickednes hee hath conceiued mischeefe but he shall bring foorth a lye the third degree is the birth of sinne namelye the committing of sinne by the assistance both of the faculties of the soule and the power of the bodye the fourth degree is perfection whe sin being by custome perfect and as it were ripe the sinner reapeth death that is damnation this appeareth in the example of pharaoh wherfore custome in any sin is fearfull sinne actually committed hath fiue differences first to consent with an offender and not actually to commit sinne ephe haue no fellowship with the vnfruitfull works of darkenes but reproue them rather this is done three manner of waies i when as a man in iudgement somewhat alloweth the sinne of another nomb moses and aaron gathered the congregation together before the rocke and moses saide vnto them heare now ye rebelles shall we bring you water out of the rocke the lord spake to moses and aaron because ye beleeued me not to sanctifie me in the presence of the children of israell into the land which i haue giuen them ii when the hart approueth in affection and consent hitherto maye we referre both the ministers and maiestrates concealing and winking at offences sam ely saide why do ye such thinges for of all this people j heare euill of you doo no more my sonnes ampc now that elyes will agreeth with his sonnes sinnes it is manifest ver thou honourest thy children aboue me iii indeed by counsaile presence entisement rom they not onelye do the same but also fauour them that do them mark she saide vnto her mother what shall i aske and she sayde john baptists head ampc act when the blood of thy martyr stephen was shedde j also stoode by and consented vnto his death and kept the cloth of them that slue him the second essence is to sinne ignorantlye as when a man dooth not expresselye and distinctlye know whether that which he dooth be a sinne or not or if he knew it did not marke it tim i before was a blasphemer a persecutor and an oppressor but i was receiued to mercye for i did it ignorauntlye through vnbeliefe nom if he pushed him vnaduisedly amp not of hatred or cast vpon him any thing without laying of waite or any stone wherby he might be slaine and saw him not or caused it to fall vpon him and he dye and was not his enemy neither sought him any harme then the congregation shall iudge between the slayer and the auenger of blood according to these lawes corinthian i know nothing by my selfe yet am i not therby iustified psalm cleanse me from my secret sinnes the third difference is to sinne vpon knowledge but of infirmity as when a man fearing some imminet danger or amazed at the horror of death doth against his knowledge deny that truth which otherwise he would acknowledge and embrace such was peters fall arising from the ouermuch rashnes of the minde mingled with some feare thus all man offend when the flesh and inordinate desires so ouer rule the will and euery good endeuour that they prouoke man to that which he from his hart detesteth rom i do not the thing which i would but the euill which i would not that doo i the fourth difference is presumptuous sinning vpon knowledge psalm keepe thy servant from presumptuous sinnes let them not reigne ouer me hitherto belongeth i euery sinne committed with an high hand that is in some contempt of god nom the person that doth presumptuously ampc shall be cut off from amongst his people because he hath despised the woord of the lord and hath broken his commaundement ii presumption of god mercye in going euill ecclesiastes because sentence against an euill worke is not executed speedily therefore the hart of the children of man is fully set in them to doe e ill rom despisest thou the riches of his b fulness ampc not knowing that the bountifulnes of god leadeth thee to repentance ampc the fifth difference is to sinne vpon knowledge and set mallice against god and to this is the sinne against the holy ghost referred hitherto we haue entreated of sinne wherewith all mankinde is infected in the next place succeedeth the punishment of sinne which is threefolde the firste is in this life and that diverse wayes the first concerneth the body either in the prouision with trouble for the thinges of this life gen or a pronnesse to disease math son be of good comfort thy sinnes be forgiuen thee ioh beholde thou article made whole sinne no more least a woorse thing fall vpon thee deut the lord shall make the pestilence cleaue vnto thee vntill he hath consumed thee from the land ampc or shame of nakednes gen or in woman paines in childbirth gen vnto the woman hee said j will greatlye increase thy sorrowes and thy conceptions in sorrow shalt thou bring fo h children ii the soule is punished with trebling of conscience care trouble hardnes of hart and madnes deut the lord shal smite thee with madnes amp with blindnes and with astonying of hart iii the whole man is punished i with feareful subiection to the regiment of sathan coloss which freede vs from the power of darknes and translated vs into the kingdome of his beloued son heb he also himself tooke parte with them that he might destroy through death him that had power of death that is the deuill ii a seperation from the fellowship of god and trembling at his presence ephesians hauing their cogitation darkened and being strangers from the life of god gen i heard thy voice in the garden and was afraide because i was naked therefore i hid myselfe iv vpon a mans goods diverse calamities and dammages deut thou shalt euer be oppressed with wrong and be powled and no man shall succour thee ampc to the ende of the chap also distinction of lordships and of this commeth a care to inlarge them and bargaining with all manner of euill seruitudes v the losse of that lordly authoritie which man had ouer all creatures also their vanitie which is not onelye a weakening but also a corrupting of that excellencye of the vertues and power which god at the first put into them rom the creature is subiect to vanitie not of it own will but by reason of him which hath subdued it vnder hope ampc vi in a mans name infamie and ignominie after his death iere the second is at the last gaspe namely death or a change like vnto death rom the wages of sinne is death the third is after this life euen eternal destruction from god presence and his exceeding glory thes who shalbe punished with euerlasting perdition from the presence of god and the glory of his power predestination hath two partes election and reprobation thes god hath not appointed vs to wrath but to obtaine saluation by the meanes of our lord iesus christ election is god decree whereby on his owne free will he hath ordeined certaine man to saluation to the praise of the glorie of his grace ephesian he hath chosen vs in him before the foundation of the world according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glorie of his grace this decree is that booke of life wherein are written the names of the elect revelation another booke was opened which is the booke of life and the dead were iudged of those thinges that were written in the bookes according to their workes tim the foundation of god remaineth sure and hath this seale the lord knoweth who are his the execution of this decree is an action by which god euen as he purposed with himself worketh all those things which he decreede for the saluation of the elect for they whome god elected to this end that they should inherite eternall life were also elected to those subordinat means wherby as by steppes they might attaine this ende and without which it were impossible to obtaine it rom those which he knew before he also predestinate to be made like the image of his son that hee might be the first born amongst many brother moreouer whom he predestinate them he called whom he called the he iustified and whom he iustified them also he glorified there appertaine three things to the execution of this decree first the foundation secondlye the meanes thirdly the degrees the foundation is christ iesus called of his father from all eternitie to performe the office of the mediatour that in him all those which should be saued might be chosen heb christ tooke not to himselfe this honor to be made the high preest but he that saide vnto him thou article my son this day begat i thee gaue it him ampc esay beholde my servant i will stay vpon him mine elect in whom my soule delighteth i haue put my spirit vpon him he shall bring forth iudgement to the gentiles ephesian he hath chosen vs in him meaning christ in christ we must especially obserue two things his incarnation and his office to the working of his incarnation concurre firste both his natures secondlye their vnion thirdly their distinction christs first nature is the godhead in as much as it belongeth to the son whereby he is god philipp who being in the forme of god thought it no robbery to be equall with god ioh in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and that word was god it was requisite for the mediatour to be god i that he might the better sustaine that great miserie wherwith mankinde was ouerwhelmed the greatnes wherof these foure things declare i the greeuousnes of sinne wherwith god maiesty was infinitely offended god infinite anger against this sinne the fearfull power of death and the devil tyrannie who is prince of this world ii that he might make his humaine nature both of plentifull merite and also of sufficient efficacie for the worke of mans redemption iii that he might in still into the elect eternall life and holines esay i am the lord and there is none besides me a sauiour i haue declared and i haue saued and i haue shewed when there was no strange god among you therfore ye are my witnesses saith the lord that i am god i say the godhead in as much as it is the godhead of the son is christs diuine nature not as it is the godhead of the father or the holye ghost for it is the office of the son to haue the administration of euery outward action of the trinitie from the father to the holy ghost corinthian and he being by nature the son of the father bestoweth this priuiledge on those that beleeue that they are the sonnes of god by adoptio ioh as many as receiued him to them he gaue to be the sonnes of god christes other nature is his humanitie whereby he the mediatour is very man tim one god and one mediator between god amp man the man christ iesus it was necessary that christ should be man first that god might be pacified in that nature wherein he was offended ii that he might vndergoe punishment due to sin the which the godhead could not being voyde and free from all passion furthermore christ as he is man is like vnto vs in al things sinne onely excepted heb in all things it became him to be made like vnto his brother corinthian christ therfore is a perfect man consisting of an essentiall and true soule and bodye wherevnto are ioyned such faculties and properties as are essential vnto both in his soule is vnderstanding memorie will and such like in his body length breadth and thicknes yes it is comprehended in one place visible subiect to feeling neither is there anye thing wanting in him which maye either adorne or make for the being of mans nature againe christ in his humanitie was subiect to the infirmities of mans nature which are these i to be tempted mat iesus was caried by the spirit into the desert to be tempted of the deuill ii to feare heb who in the dayes of his flesh did offer vp praiers and supplications with strong crying and teares vnto him that was able to saue him from death and was also heard in that which he feared iii to be angrie mark then he looked round about on them angerly mourning also for the hardnes of their hartes and saide to the man stretch foorth thine hand iv forgetfulnes of his office imposed vpon him by reason of the agony astonishing his sences matth he went a little further and fell on his face and praied saying o father if it be possible let this cup passe from me neuertheles not as i will but as thou wilt these infirmities are not essentiall qualities but accidentall to mans nature and therfore may be left of christ now followeth the vnion of the two natures in christ which especially concerneth his mediation for by it his humanitie did suffer death vpon the crosse in such sort as he could neither be ouercome nor perpetuallye ouerwhelmed by it three things belong to the vniting of natures i conception by which his humane nature was by the wonderfull power and opperation of god both immediatly that is without mans help and miraculously framed of the virgin mary luke the holy ghost shall come vpon thee and the power of the most high shall ouershadowe thee ii sanctification whereby the same humane nature was purified that is altogither seuered by the power of the holy ghost from the least staine of sinne to the ende that it might be holye and be made fit to dye for others luke that holy thing which shalbe borne of thee shall be called the son of god pet christ hath once suffered for sinnes the iust for the vniust pet who did not sinne neither was there guile found in his mouth iii assumption wherby the woord namelye the second person in trinitie tooke vpon him flesh and the seed of abraham namely that his humaine nature to the ende that it being destitute of a proper and personall substance might in the person of the word obtaine it subsisting and as it were being supported of it for euer ioh that word was made flesh heb he took not vpon him the nature of angels but the seede of abraham by this wee maye see that christ is one onelye son of god not two yet in two respectes is hee one as he is the eternall word he is by nature the son of the father as he is man the same son also yet not by nature or by adoption but onlye by personall vnion luke mat this is my beloued son ampc the phrase in scripture agreeing to this vnion is the comunion of proprieties concerning which obserue two rules i of those things which are spoken or attributed to christ some are onlye vnderstoode of his diuine nature as that ioh before abraham was i am and that colos who is the image of the inuisible god the firste borne of euerye creature some againe agree only to his humanitie as borne suffered dead buried ampc luke and iesus encreased in wisdome and stature and in fauour with god and man lastly other things are vnderstoode onlye of both natures vnited together as matth this is my beloued son in whom only i am wel pleased heare him ephe he hath made subiect all thinges vnder his feet and hath appointed him ouer all thinges to be the head to the church ii some thinges are spoken of christ as he is god which must be interpreted according to his humane natures act to feede the church of god i christ which he namely according to his manhood hath purchased with his owne bloud corinthian if they had knowen this they would neuer haue crucified the lord of glorie contrarily some things are mentioned of christ as he is man which onely are vnderstoode of his diuine nature no man ascended vp to heauen but he that hath descended from heauen the son of man which is in heauen this is spoken of his manhood whereas we must vnderstand that only his deitie came downe from heauen ioh what if ye should see the son of man vz christs humane nature ascend vp where he vz his deitie was before lastly by reason of this vnion christ as hee is man is exalted aboue euery name yes he is adored amp hath such a great though not infinite measure of giftes as farre surpasse all saintes and angels ephesians and set him at his right hande in heauenly places farre aboue all principality and power and might and dominion and euery name that is named not in this world only but in that also that is to come heb when he bringeth his first begotten son into the world he saith and let all the angels of god worshippe him colloss jn whom all the treasures of wisedom and knowledge are hidden philip therefore god exalted him on hie and gaue him a name aboue all names that at the name of iesus euery knee should bow namely worship and be subiect to him both of thinges in heauen and things in earth and thinges vnder the earth the distinction of both natures is that wherby they with their properties amp effectes remaine without composition mingling or conuersion distinct ioh therefore doth my father loue me because i lay downe my life that j might take it againe no man taketh it from me but j lay it downe of my selfe i haue power to lay it downe and haue power to take it againe ioh now is the son of man glorified and god is glorified in him if god be glorified in him god shal also glorifie him in himselfe here we may obserue that there is one will in christ as god another as man matth not as i will but as thou wilt this also approoueth that sentence of the calcedon creede we confesse that one amp the same christ iesus both son lord and onely begotten is knowen and preached to be in two natures without confusion mutation distinction or separation lastly hereby it is manifest that christ when he became that which he was not namely man continued still that which he was very god thus much concerning christs incarnation his office followeth to the perfect accomplishing whereof he was annointed of his father that is he was sufficiently furnished both with giftes and authoritie hebr therefore god euen thy god annointed thee with the oyle of gladnesse aboue thy fellowes esay the spirit of the lord was vpon me therefore he annointed me ioh god giueth him not the spirite by measure this office is so appropriate to christ that neither in whole or in part can it be translated to any other heb this man because he endureth for euer hath an euerlasting priesthood or a priesthoode that can not passe from one to an other therefore christ as he is god hath vnder him emperours kinges princes to bee his vicegerents who therefore are called god psalm but as he is mediatour that is a priest a prophet and king of the church he hath no vicegerent vicar or lieutenant who in his eyther kingly or priestly office in both or but one can be in his steede christs office is threefold priestly propheticall regall psalm esay christes priesthood is an office of his whereby he performed all those things to god whereby is obtayned eternall life heb and being cosecrate was made the author of eternall saluation vnto all them that obey him amp is called of god an hie priest after the order of melchisedec chap this man because he endureth for euer hath an euerlasting priesthoode wherefore he is able also perfectly to saue all them that come vnto god by him his priesthood consisteth of two partes satisfaction and intercession satisfaction is that whereby christ is a full propitiation to his father for the elect iob if there be a messenger with him or an interpreter one of a thousand to declare vnto man his righteousnes then will he haue mercie vpon him and will say deliuer him that he goe not downe into the pit for i haue founde a reconciliation rom and are iustified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in christ iesus whom god hath set foorth to be a reconciliation through faith in his bloud ioh he is a propitiation for our sinnes christ satisfied god anger for mans offence according to his humanitie by perfourming perfect obedience to the wil of god according to his deitie by ministring such especiall dignitie to his perfect obedience as was both of full merite and efficacie before god for the saluation of the elect ioh for their sakes sanctifie i my selfe that they also may be sanctified through the truth act to seede the flocke of god which he hath purchased with his own bloud corinthian god was in christ and reconciled the world to himselfe not imputing their sinnes vnto them satisfaction comprehendeth his passion and fulfilling the law his passion is the first part of satisfaction by which he he hauing vndergone the punishment of sinne satisfied god iustice and appeased his anger for the sinnes of the faithfull his passion was on this manner a somewhat before his death partly feare arising from a sense of god wrath imminent vpon him partly griefe possessing as it were ech part of him so disturbed his sacred minde b that inwardly for a while it stroke into him a straunge kinde of astonishment or rather obliuion of his duetie imposed vpon him and outwardly c made him pray vnto his father if he would to remooue that cup from him the which he did expresse with no small crie many teares and a bloudie sweate d trickling from his bodie vnto the ground but when he came againe vnto himselfe e hee freely yeelded himselfe vnto his father to satisfie vpon the crosse for the transgression of man after this his agonie was ouerpassed f by iudas his trecherie christ is apprehended and g first he is brought to annas after to caiphas where peter denieth him h fro caiphas is he led bound to pilate i pilate posteth him ouer to herod he k trasposteth him again to pilate l who acknowledgeth his innocecy amp yet codeneth him as an offender this innocent thus codemned is m pitifully scourged crowned with thornes scoffed spitted at spitefully adiudged to the death of the crosse n on which his handes and feete are fastened with nayles here stayed not his passions but after all these o he became accursed to god the father that is god powred vpon him being thus innocent such a sea of his wrath as was equiualent to the sinnes of the whole world he now being vnder this curse through the sense and feeling of this strange terror p complaineth to his father that he is forsaken who notwithstanding encountering then with satan and his angels did vtterly vanquish q and ouercome them when this was ended his heart r was pearced with a speare till the bloud gushed out from his sides amp he gaue s vp the ghost and t commended his spirit to his fathers protection the which immediately went into paradise his bodie u whereof not one bone was broken was buried and three dayes was x ignominiously captiuated of death a mark mat b ioh c mat ioh heb d luke e heb corinthian esay f matthew g ioh h ioh i luke k luke l mat m the same place n ioh o gal p mat q coloss r ioh s heb t luke u ioh x act in this discription of christes passion wee may note fiue circumstances especially i his agony namely a vehement anguish arising vpon the conflict of two contrarie desires in him the first was to be obedient to his father the second to auoyd the horror of death luke being in an agonie he prayed more earnestly and his sweate was like drops of bloud trickling downe to the ground heb in the daies of his flesh did offer vp prayers and supplications with strong crying and teares vnto him that was able to saue him from death and was also heard in that which he feared ii his sacrifice which is an action of christes offer himselfe to god the father as a ransome for the sinnes of the elect heb now in the end of the world hath he appeared once to put away sinne by the sacrifice of himselfe in this sacrifice the oblatio was christ as he was man heb by the which will we are sanctified eue by the offer of the body of iesus christ once made the altar also was christ as he was god heb we haue an altar wherof they haue no authority to eate which serue in the tabernacle heb how much more shall the bloud of christ which through the eternal spirit offered himselfe without spot to god purge your conscience from dead workes to serue the liuing god hence is it that christ is sayd to sanctifie him selfe as he is man ioh for their sakes sanctifie i my selfe matth as the altar the gift and the temple the gold matthew christ is the priest as he is god and man heb thou article a priest for euer after the order of melchisedec tim one mediator betweene god amp man the man christ iesus who gaue himselfe a ransome for all man to be a testimonie in due time iii god the fathers acceptation of that his sacrifice in which he was well pleased for had it bin that god had not allowed of it christes suffering had bin in vaine matthew this is my beloued son in whom i am well pleased ephesians euen as christ loued vs and gaue himselfe for vs to be an offer and a sacrifice of a sweete smelling sauour to god iv imputation of mans sinne to christ wherby his father accounted him as a transgressor hauing translated the burden of mans sinnes to his shoulders esay he orne our infirmities and carried our sorrowes yet we did iudge him as plagued and smitten of god and humbled but hee was wounded for our transgressions he was broken for our iniquities ampc and ver he was counted with the transgressors and he bore the sinnes of many corinthian he hath made him to be sinne for vs which knewe no sinne that we should be made the righteousnesse of god in him v his wonderfull humiliation consisting of two partes i in that he made himselfe of small or no reputation in respect of his deitie philip he made him selfe of no reputation ampc he humbled himselfe and became obedient vnto the death euen to the death of the crosse we may not thinke that this debasing of christ came because his diuine nature was either wasted or weakened but because his deitie did as it were lay aside and conceale his power and maiestie for a season and as irenaeus saith the worde rested that the humane nature might be crucified and dead ii in that he became execrable which is by the law accursed for vs gal cursed is euerie one that remaineth not in all thinges written in the booke of the law to doe them this accursednes is either inward or outward inward is the sense of god fearefull anger vpon the crosse revelation he it is that treadeth the winepresse of the fiercenesse and wrath of almightie god esay he is grieued for our transgressions the chastis ent of our p was vpon him and with hi stripes we were healed this appeared by those drops of bloud which issued from him by his cryings to his father vpon the crosse and by sending of angels to comfort him hence was it that hee so much feared death which many martyrs entertained most willingly his outward ednesse standeth in three degrees i death vpo the crosse which was not imaginarie but true because bloud and water issued from his heart for seeing that water and bloud gushed forth together it is very like the cas et or coat which muested the heart called peri rdion was pearced as columbus obserueth in his anotomy booke ioh his death was necessarie that he might confirme to vs the testament or couenant of grace promised for our sakes heb for t cause is h the mediatour of the nowe testament that through death ampc they which were called might receiue the promise of e er all inheritance for where a testament i there must be the death of him that made the testament ampc ver ii buriall to raisie the certaintie of his death iii descension into hel which we must not vnderstand that he went locally into the place of the damned but that for the time of his abode in the graue he was vnder the ignominious dominion of death act whom god hath raysed vp and loosed the sorrowes of death because in aposstole he should be holden of it ephesians in that e as n what it is but that he had also descended first into the lowest part of the earth it was necessarie that christ should be captiuated of death that he might abolish the sting that is the power thereof corinthian o death where is thy sting o hell where is thy uictorie thus we haue heard of christs meruelous passion the which as we may further obserue is a perfect ransome for the sinnes of all and euery one of the elect tim who gaue himselfe a ransome for all man for it was more that christ the onely begotten son of god yes god himselfe for a smal while should beare the curse of the law then if the whole worlde should haue suffered eternall punishment this also is worthy our meditation that then a man is well grounded in the doctrine of christes passion when his heart ceaseth to sinne and is pricked with the griefe of those sinnes whereby as with speares he pearced the sides of the immaculate lambe of god ioh who so sinneth neither hath seene him nor knowen him zach and they shall looke vpon me whom they haue pearced and they shall lament for him as one lamenteth for his onely son and be sorrie for him as one is sorrie for his first borne after christes passion followeth the fulfilling of the lawe by which he satisfied god iustice in fulfilling the whole law rom god sent his owne son that the righteousnesse of the law might be fulfilled by vs he fulfilled the lawe partly by the holinesse of his humane nature and partly by obedience in the workes of the law rom the lawe of the spirite of life which is in christ iesus hath freed me from the law of sinne and of death matth it becommeth vs to fulfill all righteousnesse ampc now succeedeth the secod part of christs priesthood namely intercession whereby christ is an aduocate and intreater of god the father for the faithfull rom christ at the right hand of god and maketh request for vs christs intercession is directed to god the father ioh if any man sinne we haue an aduocate with the father euen iesus christ the iust now as the father is first of the trinitie in order so if he be appeased the son and the holy ghost are appeased also for there is one and the same agreement and will of all the persons of the trinitie christ maketh intercession according to both natures first according to his humanitie partly by appearing before his father in heauen partly by desiring the saluation of the elect heb christ is entred into very heauen to appeare now in the sight of god for vs amp he is able perfectly to saue them that come to god by him seeing he euer liueth to make intercession for them secondly according to his deitie partly by applying the merite of his death partly by making request by his holy spirite in the heartes of the elect with sighes vnspeakeable peter elect according to the foreknowledge of the father to the sanctification of the spirit rom the spirit helpeth our infirmities for we know not what to pray as we ought but the spirite it selfe maketh request for vs with sighes which cannot be expressed we are not therefore to imagine or surmise that christ prostrateth himselfe vpon his knees before his fathers throne for vs neither is it necessary seeing his very presence before his father hath in it the force of an humble petition the end of christes intercession is that such as are iustified by his merites should by this meanes continue in the state of grace now christes intercession preserueth the elect in couering their continuall slips infirmities and imperfect actions by an especiall and continuall application of his merites that by this meanes mans person may remaine iust and mans workes acceptable to god ioh he is a reconciliation for our sinnes and not for ours only but for the sinnes of the whole worlde pet ye as liuely stones be made a spirituall house and holy priesthood to offer vp spirituall sacrifices acceptable to god by iesus christ revelation an other angell came and stoode before the alter hauing a golden censer and much odours was giuen vnto him that hee should offer with the praiers of all saints vpon the golden alter which is before the throne and the smoke of the odours with the praiers of the saintes went vp before god out of the angels hand thus farre concerning christs priesthood now follow his propheticall and regall offices his propheticall office is that wherby he immediately from his father reuealeth his worde and all the meanes of saluation comprised in the same ioh the son which is in the bosome of his father he hath declared vnto you ioh those thinges which i heare of my father j speake to the world the word was first reuealed partly by visions by dreames by speech partly by the instinct amp motion of the holy ghost heb at sundrie times amp in diverse manners god spake in olde time to our fathers the prophets in these last daies he hath spoken to vs by his son pet prophecie came not in old time by the will of man but holy man of god spake as they were mooued by the holy ghost the like is done ordinarily by the preaching of the word where the holy ghost doth inwardly illuminate the vnderstanding luke then opened he their vnderstanding that they might vnderstad the scriptures i will giue you a mouth amp wisedome where against all your aduersaries shall not be able to speake nor resist act whose heart the lord opened that she attended to the things that paul spake for this cause christ is called the doctor lawgiuer and counseller of his church mat be ye not called doctors for one is your doctor iesus christ iam there is one lawgiuer which is able to s e and to destroy esay he shall call his name counseller ampc yes he is the apostle of our profession heb the angell of the couenant mal and the mediatour of the new couenant heb therfore the soueraigne authoritie of expounding the scripture only belongs to christ and the church hath onely the ministerie of iudgement and interpretation committed vnto her christs regall office is that whereby he distributeth his gifts and disposeth all things for the benefite of the elect psalm amp the lorde saide vnto my lorde sit thou on my right hande till i make thine enemy thy footestoole the execution of christs regall office comprehendeth his exaltation christs exaltation is that by which he after his humiliation was by litle and little exalted to glory and that in sundry respects according to both his natures the exaltation of his diuine nature is an apparant declaration of his diuine properties in his humane nature without the least alteration thereof rom declared mightily to be the son of god touching the spirite of sanctification by the resurrection from the dead act god hath made him both lord and christ whom ye haue crucified the exaltation of his humanitie is the putting off from him his seruile condition and all infirmities amp the putting on of such habituall gifts which albeit they are created and finite yet they haue so great and so maruelous perfection as possibly can be ascribed to any creature the gifts of his mind are wisedome knowledge ioy and other vnspeakable vertues of his bodie immortalitie strength agilitie vprightnesse philipp who shall change our vile bodie that it may be fashioned like vnto his glorious bodie matth he was transfigured before them and his face did shine as the sun and his cloth were as white as the light heb god euen thy god hath annointed thee with oyle of gladnesse aboue thy fellowes christs bodie although it be thus glorified yet is it still of a solide substance compassed about visible palpable and shall perpetually remaine in some certaine place luke behold my hands and my feete it is euen i touch me and see a spirite hath not flesh and bones as ye see me haue there be three degrees of christs exaltation i his resurrection wherein by his diuine power he subdued death amp raised vp himselfe to eternall life corinthian though he was crucified concerning his infirmitie yet liueth he through the power of god mat he is not here for he is risen as he sayde come see the place where the lord was layde the end of christs resurrectio was to shew that his satisfactio by his passio amp death was fully absolute for one only sin wold haue deteined the mediator vnder the dominion of death though he had fully satisfied for al the rest corinthian if christ be not raised your faith is in vaine ye are yet in your sins rom who was deliuered to death for our sinnes and is risen againe for our iustification ii his ascention into heauen which is a true locall and visible translation of christes humane nature from earth into the highest heauen of the blessed by the vertue and power of his deitie act when he had spoken these thinges while they beheld he was take vp for a cloud tooke him vp out of their sight and while they looked stedfastly towards heaue as he went behold two man stood by the in white apparell which also said man of galile why stand ye gazing into heauen this iesus which is taken vp from you into heauen shall come as ye haue seene him come into heauen ephesians he ascended far aboue all the heauens the end of christs ascention was that he might prepare a place for the faithfull giue them the holy ghost and there eternall glorie ioh in my fathers house are many mansions if it were not so i would haue tolde you i goe to prepare a place for you chap if i goe not away the comforter will liue to me and you but if i depart i will send him vnto you ampc iii his sitting at the right hand of god the father which figuratiuely signifieth that christ hath in the highest heauens actually all glory power and dominio heb by himself he hath purged our sins and sitteth at the eight hand of the maiestie in the highest places psalm the lord sayde vnto my lord sit thou at my right hande till i make thine enemy thy footestoole corinthian he must reigne till hee hath put all his enemy vnder his feete act he being full of the holy ghost looked stedfastly into heauen and saw the glorie of god and iesus standing at the right hand of god his regall office hath two parts the first is his rigiment of the kingdome of heauen part whereof is in heauen part vppon the earth namely the congregation of the faithfull in the gouernment of his church he exerciseth two prerogatiues royall the first is to make lawes ia ther is one lawgiuer which is able to saue amp to destroy the second is to ordeine his ministers ephesians he gaue some to be apostles others prophets others euangelists some pastors and teachers ampc corinthian god hath ordeined some in the church as first apostles secondly prophets thirdly teachers then them that do miracles after that the gifts of healing helpers gouernours diuersitie of tungs christs gouernment of the church is either his collection of it out of the worlde or conseruation being collected ephesians psalm the second parte of his regall office is the destruction of the kingdome of darkenes colos who hath deliuered vs from the kingdome of darkenes psalm thou shalt crush them with a scepter of iron and break them in peeces like a potters vessell luke those mine enemy that would not i should reigne ouer them bring hether and slay them before me the kingdome of darknes is the whole company of christs enemy the prince of this kingdome and of all the members thereof is the deuill ephesian ye walked once according to the course of the worlde and after the prince that ruleth in the aire euen the prince that now worketh in the children of disobedience corinthian the god of this worlde hath blinded the eyes of the infidel corinthian what concorde hath christ with belial or what parte hath the beleeuer with the infidel the members of this kingdome and subiectes to satan are his angels and vnbeleeuers amongst whome the principall members are atheistes who say in their hart there is no god psalm and magitians who bargaine with the deuill to accomplish their desires sam psalm idolaters who either adore false god or the true god in an idole corinthian turks and iewes are of this bunch so are heretikes who are such as erre with pertinacie in the foundation of religion tim apostates or reuolts from faith in christ iesus heb false christs who beare man in hand they are true christs matth there were many such about the time of our sauiour christ his firste comming as iosephus witnesseth book of iewish antiquitie the and chapters lastlye that antichrist who as it is now apparant can be none other but the pope of rome thes let no man deceiue you by any meanes for that day shall not come except there come a departing firste and that that man of sin be disclosed euen the son of perdition which is an aduersarie and exalteth himselfe against all that is called god or that is worshipped so that he dooth sit as god in the temple of god shewing himselfe that he is god revelation and i behelde another beast comming out of the earth which had two hornes like the lambe but he spake like the dragon and he did all that the first beast could doo before him and caused the earth and them that dwell therein to worshippe the first beast whose deadly wound was healed there were then first antichrist at rome when the bishops therof would be entitled vniuersal or supreme gouernours of the whole world but then were they complete when they with ecclesiasticall censure vsurped ciuill authoritie after the foundation of election which hath hitherto bene deliuered it followeth that we should entreat of the outward means of the same the meanes are god couenant and the seale thereof god couenant is his contract with man concerning life eternall vpon certain conditions this couenant consisteth of two partes god promise to man mans promise to god god promise to man is that wherby he bindeth himselfe to man to be his god if he breake not the condition mans promise to god is that whereby he voweth his allegiance vnto his lord and to perfourme the condition between them againe there are two kindes of this couenaunt the couenant of works and the couenant of grace iere beholde the dayes come saith the lord that i will make a newe couenaunt with the house of israell and with the house of iudah not according to the couenaunt that i made with their fathers when i took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of egipt the which my couenaunt they brake although i was husband to them saith the lord but this shalbe the couenat that i wil make with the house of israel after those dayes saith the lord i will put my lawe in their inward partes and write it in their harts and will be their god and they shalbe my people the couenant of works is god couenant made with condition of perfect obedience and is expressed in the morrall law the morrall law is that parte of god woord which commandeth perfect obedience vnto man as well in his nature as in his actions and forbiddeth the contrarie rom moses thus describeth the righteousnes which is of the law that the man which doth these things shall liue therby tim the end of the commaundements is loue aut of a pure ba t and of a good conscience and faith vnfained luke thou shalt loue the lord thy god with all thine hart with all thy soule and with all thy strength rom we knowe that the law is spirituall the law hath two partes the edict commanding obedience and the condition binding to obedience the condition is eternall life to such as fulfill the lawe but to transgressors euerlasting death the decalogue or ten commaundements is an abridgement of the whole lawe and the couenant of workes exo and the lord said vnto moses write thou these woordes for after the tenor of these words i haue made a couenant with thee and with jsrael and was there with the lord forty dayes and forty nights and did neither eate bread nor drinke water and he wrote in the tables the wordes of the couenant euen the ten commaundements king nothing was in the arke saue the two tables of stone which moses had put there at horeb where the lord made a couenaunt with the children of israell when he brought them out of the land of egipt matth on these two commaundementes hangeth the whole lawe and the prophets the true interpretation of the decalogue must be according to these rules i in the negatiue the affirmatiue must be vnderstood and in the affirmatiue the negatiue ii the negatiue bindeth at all times and to all times but the affirmatiue bindeth at all times but not to all times and therfore negatiues are of more force iii vnder one vice expressely forbidden are comprehended all of that kinde yes the least cause occasion or entisement thereto is aswel forbidden as that ioh vvhosoeuer hateth his brother is a manslayer mat to the end euill thoughtes are condemned as well as euill actions iv the smallest sinnes are entituled with the same names that that sinne is which is expresselye forbidden in that commaundement to which they appertaine as in the former places hatred is named murther and to looke after a woman with a lusting eye is adulterie the decalogue is described in two tables the summe of the firste table is that we loue god vvith our minde memorie affections and all our strength mat this is the first to wit in nature and order and great commaundement namely in excellencie and dignitie the first table hath foure commaundements the first teacheth vs to haue and choose the true god for our god the words are these i am jehouah thy god which brought thee out of the land of aegipt out of the house of bondage thou shalt haue none other god but me j am if any man rather iudge that these wordes are a preface to all the commaundementes then a parte of the first i hinder him not neuertheles it is like that they are a perswasion to the keeping of the first commaundement and that they are set before it to make way vnto it as being more hard to be receiued then the rest and this may appeare in that the three commaundements next following haue their seuerall reasons iehouah namely such one as from all eternitie was of and in himselfe causing all things to be whe they were not partly by creating partlye by gouerning them here beginneth the first reason of the firste commaundement taken from the name of god it is thus framed the proposition is wanting the assumption is in these words j am jehouah the conclusion is the commaundement thy god these are the wordes of the couenant of grace iere whereby the lord promiseth to his people remission of sinnes and eternall life these woordes are as a second reason of the commaundement drawen from the equalitie of that relation which is between god and his people if j be thy god thou againe must be my people and take me alone for thy god but j am thy god therefore thou must be my people and take me alone for thy god the assumption or second part of this reason is confirmed by an argumet taken from god effects whe he deliuered his people out of egipt as it were from the seruitude of a moste tirannous maister this deliuery was not appropriate onely to the israelites but in some sorte to the church of god in all ages in that it was a tipe of a more surpassing deliuery from that fearefull kingdome of darkenes corinthian j would not haue you ignorant bretheren that all our fathers were vnder the cloude and all passed through the red sea and were all baptized vnto moses in the cloude and in the sea colos who hath deliuered vs from the power of darkenes and translated vs into the kingdome of his deere son other god or strange god they are so called not that they by nature are such or can be but because the corrupt and more then diuelish hart of carnall man esteemeth so of them philip whose god is their belly corinthian whose mindes the god of this worlde hath bewitched before my fate that is figuratiuely in my sight or presence to whome the secret imaginations of the hart are knowen and this is the third reason of the first commaundement as if he should saye if thou in my presence reiect me it is a hemous offence see therfore thou do it not after the same manner reasoneth the lord gen i am god almightie therfore walke vpright make choice of jehouah to be thy god the duties here commaunded are these i to acknowledge god that is to know and confesse him to be such a god as he hath reueiled himselfe to be in his worde and creatures column increasing in the knowledge of god iere and i will giue them an rt to know me that i am the lord and they shall be my people and i will be their god for they shall returne vnto me with their whole hart in this knowledge of god must we glory ier let him that glorieth glorye in this that he vnderstandeth and knoweth me for i am the lord which shew mercy iudgment and righteousnes in the earth ii an vnion with god wherby man is knit in hart to god iosh sticke fast vnto the lord your god as ye haue done vnto this day act he exhorted all that with purpose of hart they would cleaue to the lord man cleaueth vnto god three manner of ayes in affiance in loue and feare of god affiance is that whereby a man acknowledging the power and mercy of god and in him against all assaultes whatsoeuer doth stedfastlye rest himselfe chro put your trust in the lord your god and ye shalbe assured beleeue his prophets and ye shall prosper psalm god is my light and my saluation whom should j feare god is the strength of my life of whom should j be afraide vet though an hoste pitched against me mine hart should not be afraide though war be raised against me j will be secure hence ariseth patience and alacritie in present perils psalm j should haue bene dumbe and not opened my mouth because thou diddest it sam the king said what haue j to doo with you ye sonnes of zeruiah jf he cursed because the lord saide curse dauid what is he that dare say why doost thou so gen be not sadde neither greeued with your selues that ye solde me hither for god did send me before you for your preseruation ver now then you sent me not but god himselfe kings feare not for they that be with vs are moe then they that be with them this affiance engendreth hope which is a patient exspectation of god presence and assistance in all things that are to come psalm commit thy way vnto the lord and trust in him and he shal bring it to passe verse waeite patiently vpon the lord and hope in him pro commit thy woorkes vnto the lord and thy thoughts shalbe directed the loue of god is that whereby man

all that is called god or that is worshipped so that he dooth sit in the temple of god shewing himselfe that he is god hitherto haue we entreated of the firste commaundement teaching vs to entertaine into our heartes and to make choice of one onely god the other three of the firste table concerne that holy profession which we must make towards the same god for first it is necessary to make choise of the true god secondly to make profession of god in the profession of god we are to consider the partes thereof and the time appointed for this profession the partes are two the solemne worshipping of god and the glorifying of him the second commaundement describeth such holy and solemne worship as is due vnto god the words of the commaundement are these thou shalt make thee no gra en image neither any similitude of any thinges that are in heauen aboue neither that are in the earth beneath nor in the water vnder the earth thou shalt not bow downe to them neither serue them for i am the lord thy god a beloue god visiting the iniquitie of the fathers vpon the children vpon the third generation and vpon the fourth of them that hate me and shewing mercie vnto thousandes vpon them that loue me and keepe my commaundements thou shalt not make this is the first part of the comandement forbidding to make an idoll now an idoll is not onely a certaine representation and image of some feigned god but also of the true iehoua the which may be proued against the papistes by these arguments the first is deut take therefore good heeds vnto your selues for ye saw no image in the day that the lorde spake vnto you in horeb out of the middes of the fire that ye corrupt not your selues and make you a grauen image or representation of any figure whether it be the likenesse of male of female out of the words vttered by moses a reason may be framed thus if ye saw no image namely of god ye shal make none but ye saw no image onely ye heard a voice therefore ye shall make no image of god the second reason that idolatry which the israelites committed the very same is prohibited in this commaundement but the israelites idolatry was the worship of god in an image hoseah at that day saith the lord thou shalt call me no more baali but shalt call me ishe exod aaron proclaimed saying to morrow shall be the holy day to the lord therefore the worshipping of god is an image is here prohibited any grauen image here the more speciall is put for the more generall namely a grauen image for all counterfeit meanes of god worship the first part of the comandement is here illustrated by a double distribution the first is drawn from the causes thou shalt not make thee any idol whether it be engrauen in wood or stone or whether it be painted in a table the second is taken fro the place thou shalt not make thee an idoll of things in heauen as starres and birdes or in the earth as of man woman beastes or vnder the earth as fish this place is so expounded by moses deut to the verse thou shall not bow downe to them this is the second part of the commaundement forbidding all man to fall downe before an idoll in this worde bowe downe is againe the speciall put for the generall for in it is inhibited all feigned worshippe of god for i these words are a confirmation of this commaundement perswading to obedience by foure reasons the lord which is strong the first reason god is strong amp so able to reuenge idolatry heb aielous god this speech is taken from the estate of wedlocke for god is called the husband of his church esay ephesian and our spirituall worshippe is as it were a certaine marriage of our soules consecrated vnto the lorde ierm i remember thee with the kindnesse of thy youth and the loue of thy marriage when thou wentest after me in the wildernes in a land that was not sowen here is an other argument drawen from a coparison of things that be like god people must alone worship him because they are linked to him as a wife is to her husband vnto whome alone she is bound therfore if his people forsake him and betroth them selues vnto idols he will vndoubtedly giue them a bill of diuorcement and they shall be no more espoused vnto him visuing to visite is not only to punish the children for the fathers offences but to take notice amp apprehend them in the same faults by reason they are giuen ouer to commit their fathers transgressions that for them they may be punished and this is the third reason drawen from the effects of god anger hate me it may be this is a secret aunswere the obiection wherof is not here in expresse woordes set downe but may be thus framed what if we vse idols to inflame and exite in vs a loue and remembrance of thee the aunswere is this by the contrary you may think that your vse of idoles kindleth in you a loue of mee but it is so farre from that that all such as vse them cannot choose but hate me shew mercy the fourth reason deriued from the effects of god mercy to such as obserue this commaundement here may we first obserue that god mercy exceedeth his iustice psalme the lord is full of compassion and mercy slowe to anger and of greate kindenesse verse the louing kindnesse of the lord endureth for euer ver he will not alwayes chide neither keepe his anger for euer secondly we may not surmise that this excellent promise is made to euery one particularly who is borne of faithful parents for godly isaac had godlesse esau to his son and godlesse saul had godly ionathan thou shalt neither worship false god nor the true god with a false worshippe many thinges are here forbidden i the representation of god by an image for it is a lie habak what profiteth the image for the maker thereof hath made it an image and a teacher of lies zach the idoles haue spoken vanitie ier the stocke is a doctrine of vanitie the eliber councel in the canon hath this edict we thought it not meete to haue images in churches lest that which is worshipped and adored should be painted vpon walles clement booke ad iacob do that serpent by others is wont to speake these wordes we in honour of the inuisible god are accustomed to adore visible images the which out of all controuersie is verie false august in his treatise vpon the psalm the image also of the crosse and christ crucified ought to be abolished out of churches as the brasen serpent was king hezekiah is comended for breaking in peeces the brasen serpent to which the children of israel did the burne incense this did hezekiah albeit at the first this serpent was made by the lordes appointment nomb and was a type of christes passion ioh origin in his booke against celsus we permit not any to adore iesus vpon the alters in images or vpon church walles because it is written thou shalt haue none other god but me epiphanius in that epistle which he wrote to john bishop of hierusalem sayth it is against the custome of the church to see any image hanging in the church whether it be of christ or any other saint and therefore euen with his owne handes rent he a sunder the vaile wherein such an image was painted some obiect the figure or signe which appeared to constantine wherein he should ouercome but it was not the signe of the crosse as the papists do triflingly imagine but of christes name for the thing was made of these two greeke letters conioyned together euseb in the life of constantine booke chap neither serue the cherubimes which salomon placed in the temple for the defence of images for they were onely in the holy of holiest where the people could not see them and they were types of the glory of the messiah vnto whom the very angels were subiect the which we haue now verified in christ if any man reply that they worshippe not the image but god in the image let him knowe that the creature can not comprehend the image of the creator and if it could yet god would not be worshipped in it because it is a dead thing yes the worke of mans handes not of god and therfore is more base then the smallest liuing creature of the which wee may lawfully say it is the worke of god this euinceth that no kinde of diuine worship belongeth to an image neither simply or by relation whatsoeuer the sophisticall schoole man iangle to the contrary if any man be yet desirous of images he may haue at hand the preaching of the gospell a liuely image of christ crucified gal o foolish galatians who hath bewitched you that ye should not obey the truth to whome iesus christ before was described in your sight and among you crucified the like may be said of the two sacraments and that saying of clemens is true in his booke of recognit if you will truely adore the image of god doo good vnto man and ye shall woorship his true image for man is the image of god ii the least approbation of idolatry hos they say one to another whilest they sacrifice a man let them kisse the calues now a kis is an externall signe of some allowance of a thing gen therefore it is unlawful to be present at masse or any idolatrous seruice though our minds be absent corinthian ye are bought with a price therfore glorifie god in your body and in your sperites which are god rom what saith the scripture i haue reserued vnto my selfe seuen thousand man which haue not bowed the knee to baal euseb book the martyrs when they were haled vnto the temples of idoles cried out and with a loud voice in the middes of their tortures testified that they were not idolatros sacrificers but professed and constant christians reioycing greatly that they might make such a confession that which may be obiected of naaman the syrian who woorshiped in the temple of rimmon is thus answered that he did it not with purpose to commit idolatry but to performe that ciuil obeysance which he was wont to exhibit to the kings maiestie king and for this cause are vtterly forbidden all such processions plaies and such feastes as are consecrated to the memorial and honour of idoles exodus they rose vp the next day in the morning and offered burnt offrings and brought peace offring also the people sate them downe to eat and drinke amp rose vp to play corinthian neither be ye idolaters as some of them were as it is written ampc and paule corinthian to the end earnestly dehorteth the corinthians from sitting at table in the idols temple albeit they knowe that an idole is nothing in the world tripartite history booke chap certaine souldiers refused to adore as the custome was the banner of iulian in which were painted the images of jupiter mercury and mars others bring againe the rewards which they after they had burned incense on an alter in the emperoures presence had receiued cryinge that they were christians and would liue and dye in that profession and as for their former fact it was of ignoraunce yes though they had polluted handes with idolatry of the paynims yet they kept their consciences cleane iii all reliques and monuments of idols for these after the idoles theselues are once abolished must be rased out of all memorie exod ye shall make no mention of the name of other god neither shall it be heard out of thy mouth esay and ye shall pollute the couering of the images of siluer and the rich ornament of the images of golde and cast them away as a monstruous cloth and thou shalt say vnto it get thee hence iv societie with infidel is here unlawful that serueth not onely to maintaine concord but also to ioyne man in brotherly loue of this societie there are many branches the first is marriage with infidel gen the sonnes of god saw the daughters of man that they were faire and they tooke them wiues of all that they liked malac iudah hath transgressed and an abomination is committed in israel and in ierusalem for iudah hath defiled the holinesse of the lord which he loued and hath married the daughters of a strange god ezra should we returne to breake thy comandements and ioyne in affinitie with the people of such abomination king he walked in the wayes of the kings of israel as did the house of ahab for the daughter of ahab was his wife and he did euill in the sight of the lord the second is the league in war namely a mutuall confederacie to assist one another in the same war and to haue one and the same enemy this is sundry wayes impious i if it be unlawful to craue assistance of god enemy it is likewise unlawful to indent with them that we will assist the ii it obscureth god glory as though he him self either would not or could not aide his church iii it is a thousande to one least we be infected with their idolatry and other impieties iv it endangereth vs to be made partakers of their punishments v chronicle and iehu the son of hauanas the seer went out to meete him and saide to king iehoshaphat wouldest thou helpe the wicked and loue them that hate the lord therefore for this thing is the wrath of the lord vpon thee the third is traffic as when a man wittingly and willingly doth in hope to enrich him selfe make sale of such things as he knoweth must serue to an idolatrous vse this condemneth all those marchantes which transport to idolatours and sell them frankincense waxe cloth or other such thinges as helpe them in the seruice of their idols the fourth is triall of sutes in law before iudges which are infidel corinthian brother goeth to law with brother and that vnder infidel the fifth is the worshipping of the beast and receiuing his marke revelation if any man worship the beast and his image and receiue the marke in his forehead or on his hand verse the same shall drinke of the wine of the wrath of god this beast is the church of rome i meane not that old but this new rome now no better then an hereticall and apostaticall synagogue v wilworshippe when god is worshipped with a naked and bare good intention not warranted by the word of god coloss which things in deede haue a shew of wisedome in voluntarie religion and humblenesse of minde and in not sparing the bodie neither haue they it in any estimation to satisfie the flesh sam and saul sayde bring a burne offring to me and peace offrings amp he offered a burnt offer and assoone as he had made an end of offer the burnt offer behold samuel came and ver said to saul thou hast done foolishly thou hast not kept the commandement of the lord god which he commaunded thee hitherto may we adde popish superstitions in sacrifices meates holydayes apparell temporarie and beadridden prayers indulgences auster life whippings ceremonies gestures gate conuersation pilgrimage building of altars pictures churches and all other of that rabble to these may be added consort musicke in diuine seruice feeding the eares not edifying the minde corinthian what is it then i will pray with the spirite but i will pray with the vnderstanding also i will sing with the spirite but i will sing with the vnderstanding also iustinus martyr in his booke of christian quaest and ans it is not the custome of the churches to sing their meeters with anie such kinde of instruments ampc but their manner is only to vse plaine song lastly monasticall vowes which i repugne the law of god as that vnchaste vowe of single life and proud promise of pouertie do plainely euince for he that laboureth not must not eate sayth paule and it is better to marrie then to b rne in lust sayth the same paule ii they are greater then mans nature can perfourme as in a single life to liue perpetually chaste iii they disanull christian libertie and make such thinges necessarie as are indifferent iiii they renue iudaisme v they are idolatrous because they make them partes of god worship and esteeme them as meritorious vi hypocrisie which giueth to god painted worship that is if you regard outward behauiour great synceritie if the inward and heartie affections none at all matth hypocrites well hath esaias prophecied of you saying this people commeth neere me with their mouth amp honor me with their lips but their heart is farre from me psalm the wicked man is so proud that he seeketh not for god the effects of hypocrisie are these i to seeke the pompe and glory of the world amp by all meanes to enrich it selfe notwithstanding it make a glorious shew of the seruice of god ii it is sharpe sighted and hath eagles eies to obserue other mens behauiour when in the regarding his owne it is as blind as a beetle iii to be more curious in the obseruation of ancient traditions then the statutes and commandements of almightie god iv to stumble at a straw and skip ouer a blocke that is to omit serious affaires and hunt after trifles matth v to do all thinges that they may be seene of man matth popish fasting is meere hypocrisie because it standeth in the distinction of meates and it is vsed with an opinion of merite external abstinence from meates without internall and spirituall fasting from sinne and unlawful desires esay is this such a fast as i haue chosen that a man should afflict his soule for a day and bow downe his head as a bulrush amp lie downe in sackcloth and ashes wilt thou call this a fasting or an acceptable day vnto the lord is not this the fasting that i haue chosen to loose the bandes of wickednesse to take off the heauie burdens and to let the oppressed goe free and that ye breake euery yoke vii contempt neglect and intermission of god seruice revelation i know thy workes that thou article neither cold nor hote j would thou werest cold or hote therefore because thou article luke warme and neither cold nor hote it will come to passe that i shall spewe thee out of my mouth viii corrupting of god worship and that order of gouernement which he hath ordeined for his church the which is done when any thing is added detracted or any way against his prescript mangled deut euery thing which i comand you that do neither adde to it nor detract from it this condemneth that popish eleuation of bread in the lordes supper and the administration of it alone to the people without wine together with that fearefull abomination of the masse by this we may learne to reiect all popish traditions matth in vaine doe they worship me teaching for doctrines mens precepts now it is manifest that all popish traditions they eyther on their owne nature or others abusing of them serue as well to superstition and false worshippe as to enrich that couetous and proude hierarchi whereas the scriptures contayned in the olde and new testament are all sufficient not onely to confirme doctrines but also to conforme manners timothie the whole scripture is giuen by inspiration of god and is profitable to teach to improoue to correct and to instruct in righteousnesses that the man of god may be absolute being made perfect vnto all good workes the roman hierarchie is here also condemned from the pardoner to the pope the gouernement whereof is an expresse image of the old romaine empire whether we consider the regiment it selfe or the place of the empire or the large circuite of that gouernement revelation and it was permitted to him to giue a spirite to the image of the beast so that the image of the beast should speake and should cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed ix a religious reuerence of the creature as whe we attribute more vnto him then we ought reu when i had heard and seene i fell downe to worship before the feet of the angel which shewed me these things but he said vnto me see thou doe it not for i am thy fellow servant act as peter came in cornelius met him and fell downe at his feete and worshipped him but peter tooke him vp saying stand vp for euen i my selfe am a man if then it be so hainous a thing to reuerence the creature much more to pray vnto it whether it be saint or angell rom how shall they call vpon him in who they haue not beleeued matth thou shalt worship the lord thy god and him onely shalt thou serue neither may we pray vnto christ as he is onely man but as he is god and man for wee direct not our prayers to the humanitie but to the deitie to which the humanity is knit by an hypostatical vnio this teacheth vs plainly that inuocation of anie creature is unlawful for we must pray to the that are able to know the secrets of the hart amp discerne the wisedome of the spirite now none is able to do that but such a nature as is omnipotent rom he that searcheth the harts knoweth what is the meaning of the spirite for he maketh request for the saints according to the will of god neuerthelesse such as are saints indeede are to be honoured by an approbation of god giftes in them and by an honourable mention of them and also by imitation of

consecrated to the worship and glorifying of god the words are these remember the sabboth day to keepe it holy sixe dayes shalt thou labour and doe all thy worke but the seuenth day is the sabboth of the lorde thy god in it thou shalt doe no manner of worke thou nor thy son nor thy daughter thy man servant nor thy mayde nor thy beast nor thy stranger that is within thy gates for in sixe dayes the lord made the heauen and the earth the sea and all that in them is and rested the seuenth day therefore the lorde blessed the seuenth day and hallowed it remember this clause doth insinuate that in times past there was great neglect in the obseruation of the sabboth and would that all degrees and conditions of man should prepare themselues to sanctifie the same especially those that be gouernours of families incorporations and cities to whom this commaundement is directed to keepe it holy or to sanctifie it to sanctifie is to seuer a thing from common vse and to consecrate the same to the seruice of god here are described the two partes of this commaundement the first whereof is rest from labour the second sanctification of that rest sixe dayes these wordes containe a close aunswere to this obiection it is much to cease from our callings one whole day the answere together with a first reason to inforce the sanctification of the sabboth is in these wordes it is taken from the greater to the lesse if j permit thee to follow thy calling sixe whole dayes thou maiest well and leaue one onely to serue me but the first is true therefore the second the first proposition is wanting the second or assumption are these words sixe daies ampc the coclusion is the commandement it selfe here may we see that god hath giuen vs free libertie to worke all the sixe dayes the which freedome no man can annihilate neuerthelesse vpon extraordinary occasions the church of god is permitted to separate one day or more of the seuen as neede is either to fasting or a solemne day of reioycing for some benefite receiued ioel the seuenth day the second reason of this commandement taken from the end thereof the assumption is in these wordes the seuenth day ampc where we must note that god alone hath this priuiledge to haue a sabboth consecrated vnto him and therefore all holy dayes dedicated to whatsoeuer eyther angell or saint are unlawful howsoeuer the church of rome haue imposed the obseruation of them vpon many people in it thou shalt doe no this is the conclusion of the seconde reason illustrated by a distribution from the causes thou thy son thy daughter thy servant thy cattell thy stranger shall cease that day from your labours any worke that is any ordinary worke of your callings and such as may be done the day before or left well vndone till the day after yet for all this we are not forbidden to performe such works euen on this day as are both holy and of present necessitie such are those workes which doe vppon that day preserue and maintaine the seruice and glorie of god as a sabboth dayes iourney act which is now to hierusalem containing a sabboth dayes iourney the killing and dressing of sacrificed beast in the time of the law matthew haue ye not read in the law how that on the sabboth dayes the priestes in the temple breake the sabboth amp are blamelesse iourneyes vnto the prophetes and places appointed vnto the worship of god king he saide why wilt thou goe to him this day it is neither new moone nor sabboth day psalm they goe from strength to strength till euery one appeare before god in zion such also are the workes of mercy whereby the safetie of life or good is procured as that which paul did act as paul was long preaching eutichus ouercome with sleepe fell downe from the third loft and was taken vp dead but paule went downe and layd himselfe vpon him and embraced him saying trouble not your selues for his life is in him v and they brought the boy aliue and they were not a litle comforted to help a beast out of a pit luke which of you shall haue an oxe or an asse fallen into a pit and will not straight way pull him out on the sabboth day prouision of meate and drinke matth iesus went through the corne on a sabboth day and his disciples were an hungred and began to pluck the eares of corne and to eate in prouision we must take heede that our cookes and houshold servant breake not the sabboth the reason of thi framed from the less to the greater out of that place sam dauid longed and sayd oh th one would giue me to drinke of the water of the well of beth lehem which is by the gate ver then the three mightie brake into the host of the philistines and drew water out of the well of beth lehem that was by the gate and tooke and brought it to dauid who would not drinke thereof but powred it for an offer vnto the lord ver and sayde o lord be it farre from me that i should doe this is not this the bloud of the man that went in ieopardie of their liues therefore would he not drinke it the reason standeth thus if dauid would not haue his servant adventure their corporall liues for his prouision nor drinke the water whe they had prouided it much lesse ought we for our meates to adventure the soules of our servant watering of cattell matth the lord answered and sayd thou hypocrite will not any of you on the sabboth dayes loose his oxe or asse out of the stable and bring him to the water vpon the like present necessitie phisicians vppon the sabboth day may take a iourney to visite the diseased mariners their voyage shepheardes may tende their flocke and midwiues may helpe woman with child mark the sabboth was made for not man for the sabboth within thy gates this word gate signifyeth by a figure iurisdiction and authoritie matth the gates of hell shall not ouercome it let this be a looking glasse wherein all inholders and intertayners of strangers may looke into themselues and behold what is their duetie for in sixe dayes the third reason of this commaundement from the like example god sanctified the sabboth when he did consecrate it to his seruice man sanctifie it when they worship god in it in this place we are to consider the sabboth how farre foorth it is ceremoniall and how farre foorth morall the sabboth is ceremoniall in respect of the strict obseruation thereof which was a type of the internal sanctification of the people of god amp that is as it were a continuall resting from the worke of sinne exod speake thou also vnto the children of israel and say notwithstanding keepe ye my sabboths for it is a signe betweene me and you in your generation that ye may know that i the lord do sanctifie you the same is recorded ezech it signified also that blessed rest of the faithfull in the kingdome of heauen isaiah from moneth to moneth and from sabboth to sabboth shall all flesh come to worship before me sayth the lord heb if iesus had giuen them a rest ampc the sabboth is likewise ceremoniall in that it was obserued the seuenth day after the creation

with oyle and the drinke offer thereof ver this is the burnt offring of euery sabboth beside the continuall burnt offer and drinke offer thereof but now in the light of the gospell amp the churches professing the same the ceremony of the sabboth is ceased coloss let no man condemne you in meate and drinke or in respect of an holy day or of the new moone or of the sabboth ver which are but shadowes of things to come but the bodie is christ the obseruation of the sabboth was translated by the apostles from the seuenth day to the day following act the first day of the weeke the disciples being come together to breake bread paul preached to them corinthian concerning the gathering for the saints as i haue ordained in the churches of galatia so do ye also euery first day of the weeke let euery one of you put aside by himselfe and lay vp as god hath prospered him that then there be no gatherings when i come this day by reason that our sauiour did vpon it rise againe is called the lord day revelation i was rauished in the spirite on the lord day the obseruation of the sabboth thus constituted by the apostles was neuerthelesse neglected of those churches which succeeded them but after was reuiued amp established by christian emperors as a day most apt to celebrate the memorie of the creation of the world and to the serious meditation of the redemption of mankind leo and anton edict of holy dayes the obseruation of the sabboth is morall in as much as it preserueth the ministerie of the worde and the solemne worship of god especially in the assemblies of the church and in this respect we are vpon this day as well enioyned a rest from our vocations as the iewes were isaiah jf thou turne away thy foote from the sabboth from doing thy will on mine holy day and call my sabboth a delight to consecrate it as glorious to the lord and shalt honour him not doing thine owne waies ampc finally it is morall in that it freeth servant and cattell from their labours which on other dayes do seruice vnto their owners keepe holy the sabboth day this we doe if wee cease from the workes of sinne and our ordinarie callings performing those spirituall workes which are commanded in the second and third commandement i to arise earely on that morning that so we may prepare our selues to the better sanctifying of the sabboth ensuing this preparation consisteth in priuate prayers and taking account of our seuerall sinnes marke in the morning verie earely before day iesus arose and went into a solitary place and there praied the day following was the sabboth when he preached in the synagogues ver exod aaron proclaimed saying to morrow shall be the holy day of the lord so they rose vp the next day early in the morning eccl ver last take heede to thy feete when thou entrest into the house of god ii to be present at publique assemblies at ordinarie houres there to heare reuerently and attentiuely the worde preached and read to receiue the lordes supper and publiquely with the congregation call vpon and celebrate the name of the lord tim act king act when they departed from perga they came to antioch a citie of pisidia and went into the synagogue on the sabboth day and sate downe and after the lecture of the lawe and prophets the rulers of the synagogue sent vnto them saying ye man and brother if ye haue any word of exhortation for the people say on iii when publique meetings are dissolued to spend the rest of the sabboth in the meditation of god word and his creatures ps from the beginning to the ending act these were also more noble man then they which were at thessalonica which receiued the word with all readinesse amp searched the scriptures daily whether those thinges were so we must also exercise then the workes of charitie as to visite the sicke giue almes to the needie admonish such as fal reconcile such as are at iarre and discord amongst themselues ampc nehe then all the people went to eate and to drinke and to send away and to make great ioy pollute not the sabboth of the lord this is a grieuous sinne matthew pray that your flight be not in winter nor on the sabboth day lament the aduersaries sawe her and did mocke at her sabboths leuit ye shall keepe my sabboths and reuerence my sanctuarie i am the lord in this part are these things prohibited i the workes of our calling wherein if we doe ought it must be altogether in regarde of charitie and not in regard of our own priuate commoditie ii vnnecessarie iourneyes exod tary euery man in his place let no man go out of his place the seuenth day by this reason the master of a familie must that day remaine at home to sanctifie the sabboth with his houshould iii fayres vpon the sabboth day nehe when the gates of ierusalem beganne to be darke before the sabboth i commanded to shut the gates and charged that they should not be opened till after the sabboth and some of my servant set i at the gates that there should no burden be brought in on the sabboth day

rest v to vse iests sports banketting or any other thing whatsoeuer which is a meanes to hinder or withdrawe the minde from that serious attention which ought to be in god seruice for if the works of our calling must not be exercised much lesse these whereby the minde is distracted as well from god seruice as the greatest labour vi an externall obseruation of the sabboth without an internall regard of godlines esay my soule hateth your new moones and your appointed feastes they are a burthen vnto me i am wearie to beare the and when you shal stretch foorth your hands i will hide mine eyes from you and though you make many prayers i will not heare for your handes are full of bloud tim which haue a shew of godlinesse but denie the force thereof such therefore auoyd vii the manifest prophanation of the sabboth in pampering the belly surfetting adulterie and other like prophanenesse which is nothing els but to celebrate a sabboth to the deuill and not to god hitherto we haue spoken of the commaundements of the first table now followeth the second table which cocerneth the loue of our neighbour rom thou shalt not commit adultery thou shalt not kill thou shalt not steale thou shalt not beare false witnesse thou shalt not couet and if there be anie other comandement it is briefly comprehended in this saying namely thou shalt loue thy neighbour as thy self our neighbour is euerie one which is of our own flesh esay when thou seast the naked couer him and hide not thy selfe from thine owne flesh the manner of louing is so to loue our neighbour as our selues to wit truly and syncerely when as contrarily the true manner of louing god is to loue god without measure the seconde table contayneth sixe commaundements whereof the first and in the order of the ten commaundements the fift concerneth the preseruation of the dignitie and excellencie of our neighbour the wordes are these honour thy father and thy mother that they may prolong thy dayes in the land which the lord thy god giueth thee honour this word by the figure signifieth all that duetie whereby our neighbours dignitie is preserued but especially our superiours this dignitie proceedeth of this that euery man beareth in him some part of the image of god if we respect the outwarde order and decencie which is obserued in the church and common wealth in the magistrate there is a certaine image of the power and glorie of god daniel o king thou article a king of kings for the god of heauen hath giuen thee a kingdome power and strength and glorie hence is it that magistrats are called god psalm in an old man is the similitude of the eternitie of god in a father the likenesse of his fatherhoode matth and call no man your father vpon the earth for there is but one your father which is in heauen in a man is the image of god prouidence and authoritie for a man ought not to couer his head because he is the image of the glorie of god but the woman is the glorie of her husbande finally in a learned man is the likenesse of the knowledge and wisedome of god now therefore that person in whom euen the least title of the image of god appeareth is to be honoured and reuerenced thy father by a figure we must here vnderstand all those that are our superiours as parents magistrates ministers our elders and those that do excell vs to any giftes whatsoeuer the kings of gerar were called abimelech gen gen god hath made me a father vnto pharaoh and lorde ouer all his house corinthian for though ye haue tenne thousande instructours in christ yet haue ye not many fathers for in christ iesus i haue begotten you kings but his servant came and spake vnto him and sayde father if the prophet had commanded thee a great thing wouldest thou not haue done it king and elisha saw it and he cryed my father my father my father the charet of israel and the horsemen thereof and thy mother this is added least wee should despise our mothers because of their infirmities prou obey thy father which hath begotten thee and despise not thy mother when she is old here we are put in minde to perfourme due honour to our stepmothers and fathers in law as if they were our proper and naturall parentes ruth and afterward naomi her mother in law sayde vnto her my daughter shall not i seeke rest for thee that thou maiest prosper and she answered her all that thou biddest me i will doe exod but moses father in law said vnto him the thing which thou doest is not well heare now my voice i will giue thee counsell and god shall be with thee so moses obeied the voice of his father in law and did all that he had said micah for the son reuileth the father the daughter riseth vp against her mother the daughter in law against her mother in law that they may prolong parents are saide to prolong the liues of their children because they are god instruements whereby their childrens liues are prolonged for oftentimes the name of the action is attributed to the instruement wherewith the action is wrought luke make you freendes with the riches of iniquitie that when ye shall want they may receiue you into euerlasting habitations tim for in doing so thou shalt both saue thy self and them that heare me but parents doo prolong the liues of their children in commaunding them to walke in the waies of the lord by exercising iustice and iudgement gene for being become godlye they haue the promise both of this life and the life to come tim further they effect the same thing by their praiers made in the behalfe of their children hereby it plainely appeareth that the vsuall custome of children saluting their parents to aske their blessing is no light or vaine thing moreouer in these wordes the reason to moue vs to the obedience of this commaundement is drawen from the ende which reason is also a promise yet a speciall promise ephesians honour thy father and thy mother which is the firste commaundement with promise i say speciall because the promise of the second commaundement is generall and belongeth to all the rest of the commaundements and god promiseth long life not absolutely but so far as it is a blessing ephe that it may be well with thee and that thou maist liue long on earth for we must thinke that long life is not alwaies a blessing but that somtime it is better to die the to liue isay the righteous perisheth and no man considereth it in hart and mercifull man are taken away and no man vnderstandeth that the righteous is taken away from the evil to come but if at any time the lord giueth a short life to obedient children he rewardeth them againe with eternall life in heauen and so the promise faileth not but changeth for the better firste reuerence towardes all our superiours the actions whereof are reuerentlye to rise vp before any man which passeth by vs leuit rise vp before the horehead and honor the person of the olde man and dread thy god i am the lorde to meete him that commeth towards vs gene and he lifted vp his eyes and looked and loe three man stood by him and when he saw them he ranne to meete them from the tent doore kinges when bethsheba came to speake to king salomon the king rose to meete her and bowed himselfe vnto her to bow the knee mark and when he was gone out of the waye there came one running and kneeled to him genesis he ran to meete them and bowed himselfe to the ground to stand by those that sit down genesis and he tooke butter and milke and the calfe that he had prepared and set before them and stoode himselfe by them vnder the tree and they did eate exodus now on the morrowe when moses sat to iudge the people the people stoode about moses from morning vnto euen to giue the cheefest seate kinges and he sat downe on his throne and he caused a seate to be set for the kings mother and she sat at his right hand luke he spake also a parable to the guestes when he marked how they chose out the chiefe roomes and sayde vnto them when thou shalt be bidden of any man to a wedding set not thy selfe downe in the cheefest place least a more honorable man then thou be bidden of him and he that bad both him and thee come and saye to thee giue this man roume and thou then begin with shame to take the lowest roume genesis so they sat before him the eldest according to his age and the youngest according to his youth and the man marueiled among themselues to let our superiours speake before

answered and said naye my lord but i am a woman troubled in spirit i haue drunk neither wine nor strong drinke secondly towards those that are our superiours in authoritie and firste obedience to their commaundements rom let euery soule be subiect to the higher powers we are to be admonished to obedience because euery higher power is the ordinance of god and the obedience which we performe to the god accepteth it as though it were done to himselfe and to christ rom whosoeuer therefore resisteth the power resisteth the ordinance of god and they that resist shall receiue to themselues

abraham said to sarai beholde thy mayd is in thine hand do with her as it pleaseth thee then sarai dealt roughly with her wherfore she fledde from her then the angell of the lord saide vnto her returne vnto thy dame and humble thy selfe vnder her hands and although the punishment should be vniust yet must we suffer it vntill we can get some lawful remedy for the same peter for it is thanke worthie if a man for conscience toward god endure griefe suffering wronfully for what praise is it if when ye be buffeted for your faults ye take it patiently but and if when ye doo well ye suffer

unlawful because they are not equall meanes ordeined of god to determine controuersies in that it falleth out in such combates that he is conquerour before man who indeede is guiltie before god this

reprooueth non residencie of ministers which is an ordinarie absence of the minister from his charge namely from that particular congregation committed vnto him isaiah i haue set watchmen vpon thy walles o ierusalem which all the day and all the night continually shall not cease ye that are mindfull of the lord keepe not silence and giue him no rest till he repaire and vntill he set vp ierusalem the praise of the world act take heede therefore vnto your selues and to all the flocke whereof the holy ghost hath made you ouerseers to feede the church of god which he hath purchased with his owne bloud for i know this that after my departing shall grieuous wolues enter in among you not sparing the flocke moreouer of your selues shall man arise speaking peruerse things to draw disciples after them therefore watch and remember that by the space of three yeares i ceased not to warne euerie one night and day with teares pet feede the flocke of god which dependeth vpon you caring for it not by constraint but willingly not for filthy lucre but of a readie minde not as though ye were lordes ouer god heritage but that ye may be ensamples to the flocke the councill of antioch the canon if any bishop be by imposition of handes inducted into a charge and appointed to gouerne a people and he neglect to take vpon him that office but delayeth to goe vnto the congregation alloted vnto him such an one shal be prohibited from the lordes table till he be enforced to attend vpon that charge or at the least somewhat be determined by a complete assemblie of the ministers of that prouince the councill of sardice the canon we remeber that our brother in a former assemblie decreed that if any lay man remaining three sabboths or lord daies that is three weekes in a citie did not in the same citie frequent the church assemblies he should be excommunicated if then such things are not allowable in lay man much lesse in ministers for whom it is neither lawful nor conuenient without vrgent necessitie to be absent from his parish church longer then the time aboue mentioned to this decree there was not one non placet but euerie one saide it liketh vs well the councill helde at constantinople in the canon decreed that ministers ought not to haue their substitutes or vt ars but in their owne persons with feare and chearefulnesse performe all such duties as are required of them in the seruice of god the canon law doth conclude the same thing dist canon siquis vult debent in desineter ampc the bishops saith that canon ught to be contenually resident in god tabernacle that they may learne somewhat of god and the people of them whilest they read often and meditate vpon god worde againe in the canons intituled pontifices and siquis in clero episcopos qui dominici gregis suscipiunt curam ampc the bishops which take vpon them to feede god flocke ought not to depart from their duetie least they loose that excellent talent which god hath bestowed vpon them but rather striue with that one talent to get three more talents and in the canon of those which are termed the canons of the apostles there is an expresse mandate that such whether bishop or senior who attendeth not vpon their office in the church shal foorthwith be remooued from that place the calced councill can let no man be ordeined minister of two churches in two seueral cities but let him remaine in that vnto which he was first called and if for vaine glorie he shal afterward go to a greater congregation let him immediately be recalled to his first charge and in that onely exercise his ministery but if one he called to another charge let him simply giue ouer the foreuer and haue no interest in the same ampc for this thing looke to the decrees of damasus and the councell of trent section can there are notwithstanding the former testimonies some cases wherein it is permitted to the minister that he may be absent i sicknesse the councill of mentz canon if a bishop be not at home or be sicke or vpon some exigent can no present at his parish let him procure one who vpon sabboths and festiuall dayes will preach vnto his charge augustine testifieth epistle that he was absent on the like occasion ii allowance of the church to be absent for a time vpon some necessary and publique commoditie of the same coloss epaphras is their minister but chap he being absent

emperour iii if by reason of persecution he be enforced to flee and see no hope to procure the safetie of his people this made cyprian to be absent from carthagena as he testifieth in his epistles thus much concerning sins against our neighbour now followeth such sinnes as a man committeth against his owne person as when a man doth hurt kill and endanger him selfe mat if any man will follow me

concerning such iniuries as he offereth vnto thee thou shalt not be angry against him vpon a small occasion nomb moses was a weeke man aboue all that liued vpon the earth prou the discretion of a man deferreth his anger and his glorie is to passe by an offence thou must be slowe to wrath and neuer angry but for a most iust cause marke then he looked round about on them angerly mourning also for the hardnesse of their harts prou he that is slow to wrath is of great wisedome but he that is of an hastie minde exalteth follie thine anger must be but for a while ephesians be angrie and sinne not

haue drunk neither wine nor strog drink but haue powred out my soule before the lord philemon v it may be that he therefore departed for a season that thou shouldest receiue him for euer by ouerpassing some wantes and infirmities in mens words and deedes prou it is a mans honour to passe by infirmities by couering them with silence pet aboue all things haue feruent loue amongst you for loue couereth a multitude of sins prou he that couereth transgression seeketh loue but he that repeateth a matter seperateth the prince by taking euery thing if it be possible in the best part

conditions annexed vnto the same and we may make this couenant not onely with christians but for the maintenance of peace with infidel also for that which is godly to be performed is no lesse godly to be promised but it is a note of true godlinesse to be as much as may be at peace with all man therefore to promise peace by couenant is very godly we may see the experience of this in the liues of holy man gen at that same time abimelech and pichol his chiefe captaine spake vnto abraham saying god is with thee in all that thou doest v now therefore sweare vnto me here by god that thou wilt not hurt me nor my children nor my childrens children ampc ver then abraham sayd i will sweare v then abraham took sheep amp beeues and gaue the vnto abimeclech and they two made a couenant gen now

not to me to lend our helping hand when our neighbors bodie is in any danger ioh hereby we perceiued loue that he layd downe his life for vs therefore also ought we to lay down our liues for the brethre v when a man is dead we ought to commit the dead corps to the graue as may appeare by these arguments the instinct of nature it selfe the examples of the patriarkes and other holy personages abraham buried sarah gen iaakob is buried by his sonnes gen steuen by religious and deuout man act the lordes owne approbatio of buriall in that he numbreth it amongst his benefites for the want thereof is a curse ier he viz iehoiakim shall be buried as an asse is buried euen drawen and cast foorth without the gates of jerusalem therefore rather then moses should be vnburied the lord himself

of his sepulchre vnto this day there is no dead carkase so lothsome as a man is the which both argueth the necessitie of buriall and how ougly we are in the sight of god by reason of sinne the bodie must rise againe out of the earth that it may be made a perpetuall mansion house for the soule to dwell in the body of the faithfull are the temples of the holy ghost and therefore must rise againe to

of those which remaine aliue as them which are dead concerning the liuing they must see that their mourning be moderate and such as may well expresse their affection and loue to the partie departed ioh he sayde where haue ye layde him they answered lord come and see ver then iesus wept and ver the jewes said behold how he loued him they must auoyde superstition and not surmise that funerall ceremonies are auaileable to the dead such are the tites of the church of rome as to be buried in a church especially vnder the altar and in a friars coole they ought to take heede of superfluous pompe and solemnities for of all ostentations of pride that is most foolish to be boasting of a lothsome and a deformed corps isaiah thus sayth the lord god of hostes go get thee to that treasurer to

when thou commest into thy neighbours corne thou maiest plucke the eares with thine hand but thou shalt not moue a sickle to thy neighbours corn mat iesus went on the sabboth day through the corne and his disciples were an hungred and began to pluke the eares of the corne and to eate ampc in the vintage and time of haruest we ought neither to leaue the trees naked of grapes nor rake vp after the reaping eares of corne but leaue the after gatherings for the poore leuit when you reape the haruest of your land thou shalt not rid clean the corners of thy field when thou reapest neither shalt thou

doth so assault his aduersary as that he neither purposeth his owne reuenge or his enemy hurt but onely his alone safety from that unminent danger the seuenth commaundement sheweth how wee maye preserue the chastitie of our selues and of our neighbour the words are these thou shalt not commit adultery adulterie to commit adulterye signifieth as much as to doo any thing what way soeuer wherby the chastitie of our selues or our neighbours may be stayned mat thou shalt no way either hurt or hinder thy neighbours chastitie in this parte are prohibited i the lust of the hart or the evil concupiscense of the flesh mark i say vnto you whosoeuer looketh on a woman to lust after her he hath alreadye committed adulterie with her in his hart coloss mortifie your members which are on earth fornication vncleannes the inordinate affection euill concupiscense ii burning in the flesh which is an inward feruencie of lust whereby the godlye motions of the hart are hindred ouerwhelmed and as it were with cotrary fire burnt vp corinthian if they cannot abstaine let them marry for it is better to marry then to burne iii strange pleasures about generation prohibited in the word of god the which are many with beast leuit thou shalt not be with any beast to be defiled therewith neither shall any woman stand before a beast to lye downe therto for it is an abhomination with the devil as witches doo by their owne confession for why should not a spirit as well haue society with a witch as to eat meat with one of the same sexe leuit thou shalt not lie with the male as one lieth with a woman for it is abhomination this is a sin which they commit whom god hath giuen ouer to a reprobate sence rom for this cause god gaue them vp to vile affections for euen their woman did change their natural vse into that which is against nature v and the man left the naturall vse of the woman and burned in their lustes one toward another amp man with man wrought filthines it was the sin of sodom genesis where it was so common that to this day it is tearmed sodomie with such as be within the degrees of consangumitie or affinitie prohibited in the word of god leuit none shal come neere to any

and they be found v then the man that laide with her shall giue vnto the maids father fifty shekels of siluer amp she shal be his wife because he hath humbled her he can not put her away all his life corinthian neither let vs commit fornication as some of them committed fornication and fell in one day one and twenty thousand with those whereof one is married or at the least betrothed this sinne is called adulterie and god hath inflicted by his woord the same punishment vpon them which commit this sinne after they be betrothed as he dooth vpon such as are already married deut if a man be found lying with a woman maried to a man then they shall dye euen both twaine to wit the man that laye with the wife and the wife so thou shalt put away euill from jsrael v jf am aide be betrothed to an husband and a man finde her in the towne and lye with her ver then shal he bring the both vnto the gate of the same citie and shal stone the to death with stones this is a marueilous great sinne as may appeare in that it is the punishment of idolatry rom they turned the glory of the vncorruptible god to the similitude of the image of a corruptible man ampc ver wherefore god gaue them vp vnto their hartes lustes vnto vncleannes yes this sinne is more heinous then theft pro man doe not despise a theefe when he stealeth to satisfie his soule when he is hungry ver but he that committeth adulterie with a woman is destitute of vnderstanding he that doth it destroyeth his owne soule againe the adulterer breaketh the couenant of mariage which is god couenant prouerbs which forsaketh the guide of her youth and forgetteth the couenant of her god adulterers dishonest their own body corinthian flee fornication euerye sinne that a man doeth is without the bodye but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his owne bodye and bereaue their neighbours of a great and vnrecouerable benefite namely of chastitie as for the children which are begotten in this sorte they are shut out

wife nor his servant nor his maid nor his oxe nor his asse nor any thing thy neighbor hath couet the cogitation or motion of the hart is of three sorts the first is some glauncing or sodaine thought suggested to the minde by satan which sodainly vanisheth away and is not receiued of the minde this is no sinne for it was in christ when he was tempted by the deuill matth the second is a more parmenent thought or motion the which as it were tickleth and inueigleth the minde with some inward ioy the third is a cogitation drawing from the will and affection full assent to sinne we are to vnderstand this commaundement of the second sort of motions onely not of the firste or of the last to which the fiue former commandements doe belong now then to couet is to think inwardly and also to desire any thing wherby our neighbour may b e hindred albeit there ensue no assent of the will to commit that euill for the very philosophers condemne couetousnes of the very hart and civilians disalow a purpose onely to doo evil if it be enioyned with a manifest deliberation as for the concupiscence in this place forbidden we may wel think it is more close and secret because st paul a doctor of the law was a togither ignorant of it rom j had not knowne lust except the l e had said thou shalt not lust againe if that concupiscence immediatlye going before the consent were not prohibited in this place there must be a great confusion in the decalogue for the seauenth comaundement forbiddeth some kinde of coueting of our neighbours wife house the commandement is illustrated by an argument drawen from the distribution of the obiects of concupiscence whence it is apparant that onelye euill concupiscence is condemned in this place column for there is a good concupiscence or desire as of meat and drinke and that of the spirit gal the spirite lusteth against the flesh thou shalt not couet that which is thy neighbours here are prohibited i concupiscence it selfe namelye originall corruption in as much as it is hurtfull to our neighbour iames ii each corrupt and sudden cogitation and passion of the hart springing out of that bitter roote of concupiscence gal the sh lusteth against the spirite luke thou shalt loue the lord with by soule to this place appertaineth satans suggestion if after the first offer it be entertained and receiued in the closet of the hart iii the least cogitation and motion the which though it procure not consent delighteth and tickleth the hart of this kinde are these foolish wishes i would such an house were mine such a liuing such a thing ampc and hitherto may we referre all vnchaste dreames arising from concupiscence couet that only which is auaileable to thy neighbour here are commended i a pure hart towards our neighbour tim the end of the commaundement is loue out of a pure hart a good conscience and faith vnfeined ii holy cogitations and motions of the spirite paul praieth thes that the thessalonians may be holye not onelye in body and soule but also in spirite ephe iii a conflict against the euill affections amp lusts of the flesh rom i reioyce in the law of god in regard of the inward man v but i see another law in my members rebelling against the law of my minde and making me captiue to the lawe of sinne which is in my members v miserable man that j am who shall deliuer me from this bodie of death corinthian the vse of the law in vnregenerate persons is threefolde the first is to lay open sinne and make it known rom by the workes of the law shall no flesh be iustified in his sight for by the lawe commeth the knowledge of sinne the second vse is accidentarily to effect and augment sinne by reason of the flesh the which causeth man to decline from that which is commaunded and euer to encline to that which is prohibited rom sinne tooke occasion by the commaundement and wrought in me all maner of concupiscence for without the law sinne is dead verse for i once was aliue without the lawe but when the commaundement came sinne reuiued v but i died and that commandement which was ordeined vnto life was found to be vnto me vnto death the third vse is to denounce eternal damnatio for the least obediece without offerig any hope of pardon this sentence the law pronounceth against offenders amp by it partly by threatning partly by terrifying it reigneth and ruleth ouer man rom we know that whatsoeuer the law saith it saith to them which are vnder the law that euery mouth may be stopped and all the worlde be culpable before god gal as many as are of the workes of the lawe are vnder the curse for it is writter cursed is euery one that continueth not in al that is written in the book of the law to do them corinthian if the ministration of death writte with letters and engrauen in stones was glorious v how shall not the ministration of the spirit be more glorious ver for if the ministration of condemnation were glorious ampc the ende why sinne reigneth in man is to vrge sinnes to flye vnto christ gala the scripture hath concluded al vnder sin that the promise by the faith of christ should be giuen to them that beleeue verse wherefore the law was our schoolemaster to christ heb the countenance of this power of the lawe is perpetuall vnlesse a sinner repent and the very first act of repentance so freeth him that he shall no more be vnder the law but vnder grace sam then said dauid to nathan i haue sinned against the lord wherfore nathan said to dauid the lord also hath forgiuen thy sin and thou shalt not dye rom sinne shall not haue dominion ouer you for ye are not vnder the law but vnder grace if therfore thou desirest seriouslye eternall life first take a narrow examination of thy selfe and the course of thy life by the square of god law then set before thine eyes the curse that is due vnto sin that thus bewailing thy miserie and dispairing vtterlye of thine owne power to attaine euerlasting happines thou maist renounce thy self and be prouoked to seeke and sue vnto christ iesus the vse of the law in such as are regenerate is farre otherwise for it guideth them to new obedience in the whole course of their life which obedience may be acceptable to god by christ rom do we therefore through faith make the law of none effect god forbid nay we rather establish the law psalm thy testimonies are my delight they are my counsellers ver thy word is a lanterne to my feet and a light vnto my pathes hitherto concerning the couenont of workes and of the law who followeth the couenant of grace the couenant of grace is that whereby god freely promising christ and his benefites exacteth again of man that he would by faith receiue christ and repent him of his sinnes hose in that day will i make a couenant for them ampc ver and j will marry thee to me for euer yes i will marrie thee vnto me in righteousnes and iudgement and in mercy and in compassion ver i will euen marrie thee vnto me in faithfulnes and thou shalt know the lord ezech i will poure clean water vpon you and ye shalbe clean yes from all your filthines and from all your idoles will i clense you ver and j will giue you a new hart and a new spirit wil i put within you ver and cause you to walke in my statutes mal the lord whom ye seeke shall speedily come to his temple euen the messenger of the couenant whom ye desire behold he shall come saith the lord of hostes this couenant is also named a testament for it hath partly the nature amp properties of a testament or will first it is confirmed by the testator heb when a tastament is there must be the death of him that made the testament v for the testament is confirmed when man are dead for it is yet of no force so long as he that made it is aliue secondly in this couenant we do not offer much and promise small to god but in a maner do only receiue euen as the last wil and testament of a man is not for the testators but the heires commoditie the couenat albeit it be one in substance yet it is distinguished into the old and new testament the old testament or couenant is that which in tipes and shadowes prefigured christ to come and to be exhibited the new testamet declareth christ alredy come in the flesh and is apparantly shewed in the gospell the gospell is that part of god worde which conteineth a most worthie and welcome message namelye that mankinde is fullye redeemed by the blood of iesus christ the onely begotten son of god manifest in the flesh so that now for all such as repent and beleue in christ iesus there is prepared a full remission of all their sinnes together with saluation and life euerlasting john as moses lifted vp the serpent in the wildernes so must the son of man be lift vp v that who so beleeueth in him should not perish but haue euerlasting life act to him also giue al the prophets witnes that through his name al that beleue in him shall receiue remission of sinnes the end and vse of the gospell is to manifest that righteousnes in christ wherby the whole law is fully satisfied and saluation attained it is the instrumet and as it were the conduit pipe of the holy ghost to fashion and deriue faith into the soule by which faith they which beleeue do as with an hand apprehend christes righteousnes rom j am ashamed of the gospell of christ for it is the power of god to saluation to as many as beleeue to the iew first amp then to the greek v for the iustice of god is reuealed by it from faith to faith john it is the spirite which quickneth the flesh profiteth nothing the wordes which i speake are spirite and life the gospel preached is in the flourishing estate of christs church that ordinarie means to beget faith but in the rumous estate of the same when as by apostacie the foundations therof are shaken and the clear light of the word is darkned then this worde read or repeated yes the very sound thereof being but once heard is by the assistance of god spirite extraordinarily effectuall to them whom god wil haue called out of that great darknes into his exceeding light rom how shall they call on him in who they haue not beleeued and how shal they beleue in him of who they haue not heard and how shal they hear without a preacher act and they which were scattered abroad because of the affliction that arose about steuen walked throughout till they came to phenice and cyprus and antioch preaching the word to no man but to the iewes onely v now some of them were man of cyprus amp of cyren which whe they were come into antioch spake vnto the grecians amp preched the lord jesus v and the hand of the lord was with them so that a great number beleeued and turned vnto the lord ioh the woman then left her water pot and went her way into the citie and saide to the man v come see a man which hath told me all things that euer i did is not he the christ then they went out of the citie and came vnto him v now many of the samaritans beleued in him for the saying of the woman which testified he hath told me al things that euer i did ver and many mo beleeued because of his own word ver and they said vnto the woman now we beleeue not because of thy saying for we haue heard him our selues and know that this is indeed the christ the sauiour of the worlde rom i dem und haue they not heard no doubt their sound went out through all the earth and then words into the ends of the worlde thus we may see how many of our forefathers and ancestours in the mids of poperye obteined eternall life reuela the dragon was wrothe with the woman and went and made war with the remnant of her seede which kept the commaundements of god and haue the testimonye of iesus christ sam what saith the diuine oracle j haue reserued to me seauen thousand man which neuer bowed knees to baal thus much of the preaching of the word now follow the appendants to the same namelye the sacraments a sacrament is that wherby christ and his sauing graces are by certaine externall rites signified exhibited and sealed to a christian man rom he receiued the signe of circumcision as the seale of the righteousnes of the faith which he had when he was ncircumcised gen ye shall circumcise the for of your flesh and it shalbe a signe of the couenant and you we must not therefore surmise that there is any inherent force or efficacie of sanctifying in the visible and externall signe of the sacrament as the bath water haue to cure diseases for the power of sanctification is appropriate onely to the holie ghost and christ hath ordeyned the signe to signifie grace not to conferre it in euery sacrament we must obserue the partes and the mutuall relation that partes haue one to another the partes of a sacrament are eyther the externall signes or the thing signified that is the substance of the sacrament the externall signe is either some prescript and sensible matter or the externall action in the vse of the same the thinges signified in the sacrament are eyther christ and his benefites or the internal action that is about christ the internall action is the action either of god or of faith the action of god is his offer applying and sealing vp of christ and his benefites in the heartes of the faithfull the action of faith is the consideration desire apprehension and receiuing of christ in the sacrament the mutuall relation of the partes of a sacrament is an agreeable vnion and respect of externall amp internall both things with things amp actions with actions according to god holy institutions by which it is made a sacramet because the signes incurring into the externall senses doe by a certaine proportion mooue a christian minde to consider the things signified and also to apply them vnto their holy end this mutuall and as i may say sacramentall relation is the cause of so many figuratiue speeches and metonymies which are vsed as when one thing in the sacrament is put for an other as i the signe is vsed for the thing signified exo ye shall eate it namely the lambe in haste for it is the lordes passeouer ioh i am that liuing bread which came downe from heauen if any eate of this bread he shall liue for euer and the bread which i will giue is my flesh which i will giue for the life of the world corinthian christ our passeouer is sacrificed for vs corinthian we that are many are one bread and one bodie because we are all partakers of one bread ii the name of the thing signified is giuen to the signe as the bread is christs bodie the cuppe is christs bloud corinthian mat iii the effect of the thing signified is giuen to the signe as circumcision is a couenant gen act the cup is the new testament in christs bloud luke baptisme is the washing of the new birth iiii that which properlye belongeth to the signe is attributed to the thing signified deut circumcise the fore skin of your harts ioh vnlesse ye eate the flesh of the son of man and drinke his blood ye shall haue no life in you hence it appeareth that there is small or no cause why the papists should so vrge transubstantiation and the lutherans consubstantiation as they doe there are two sacraments corinthian i would not haue you ignorant that all our fathers were vnder the cloude and all passed through the sea verse and were all baptized vnto moses in the cloude and in the sea v and did all eat the same spirituall meat ver and dranke all the same spirituall drinke for they dranke of the spirituall rocke that followed them which rocke was christ tertull booke contra marcion august de symbol ad catechum book chap the first sacrament is that whereby christians are imitiated and admitted to the church of god and this is baptisme the second sacrament whereby the church is preserued and nourished is the lord supper baptisme is a sacrament by which such as are within the couenant are washed with water in the name of the father the son and the holy ghoste that being thus engraffed into christ they may haue perpetual felowship with him mat go teach all nation baptizing them in the of the father the son and the holye ghost matth he that beleeueth and is baptized shalbe s he that beleeueth not shalbe condemned corinthian is christ deuided was paul crucified for you either were ye

take holde of one man saying we wil eate our owne bread and we will weare our owne garmentes onely let vs be called by thy name and take away our reproch by this it is manifest that in this washing of baptisme there is sealed and propounded a maruellous solemne couenant and contract first of god with the baptized in that god the father vouchsafed to receiue him into fauour the son to redeeme him the holy ghost to purifie and regenerate him secondly of the baptised with god who promiseth to acknowledge inuocate and worship none other god but the true iehouah which is the father son and holy ghost the externall and visible matter of baptisme is water for the minister may not baptize with anie other liquor but onely with naturall water this was the iudgemet of the primitiue church for when as a certaine minister for want of water tooke sande and baptized one with that the partie thus besanded was further baptized the former being esteemed of none effect niceph history booke chap the externall forme of baptisme is the ministers washing of the baptized according to the prescript rule of god word rom the ancient custome of baptizing was to dip and as it were to diue all the body of the baptized in the water as may appeare in paul rom and the councils of laodicea amp neocaesarea but now especially in cold country the church vseth only to sprinckle the baptized by reason of childrens weakenesse for very few of ripe yeares are now adaies baptized we neede not much to marueile at this alteration seeing charitie and necessitie may dispense with ceremonies and mitigate in

forme of administration be obserued must not be baptized againe of the church of god especially if after baptisme they haue beene made partakers of the lordes supper onely they ought to be instructed in the true faith euseb ecclesiastes history booke chapter sayth there was in our prouince an auncient professor of the faith yes before i was created bishop nay before my predecessor heraclas who when he was present at the baptisme of some and heard what questions they were asked and what answere they returned foorthwith come weeping vnto me and humbling himselfe before me confessed that he was baptized by an heretike yet in regard of that administratio which he saw in our church he accounted that no baptisme in that the confession there vsed was fraught with blasphemies this also be added that he was for this offence so sore grieued that he durst not so much as lift vp his eies vnto heauen wherefore he most earnestly besought me that he might be clensed and purified with the baptisme of our church and so receiue the gift of the holy ghost the which notwithstanding i durst not presume to administer but s was sufficient for him that he had beene so long a professor amongest vs and that at the receite of the lordes supper he answered amen these thinges i tolde him were of force enough to purge him and therfore i aduised him to rest himselfe in his former fa and conscience alreadie sufficiently purified especially in that he so long was partaker with vs in the sacramentes augustine booke chapter contra petiliani literas the right vse of baptisme is this when inwardly in thine heart thou sensibly feelest that through the heate of concupiscence thou article moued to comit some sinne then beginne to haue some holy meditation of that solemne vow which thou diddest make to god in baptisme againe if through infirmitie thou fallest once or often into some sinne still haue recourse vnto baptisme that there thou maiest againe receiue courage to thy soule for although baptisme bee but once onely administred yet that once testifieth that all a mans sinnes past present and to come are washed away pet ephesian therefore baptisme may be truely termed the sacrament of repentance and as it were a board to swimme vppon when a man shall feare the shipwracke of the soule marke tim rom last of all see thou neuer rest till such time as thou haue a feeling of that renuing power signified in baptisme namely the power of christes death mortifying sinne and the vertue of his resurrection in the renouation of the spirite the lordes supper is a sacrament wherewith in the signes of bread and wine such as are engraffed into christ are in him daily in a spirituall manner nourished to eternall life corinthian rom such as will in an holy sort prepare themselues to celebrate the lordes supper must haue first a knowledge of mans fall and of the promised restoration into the couenant by christ corinthian so often as ye shall eate this bread and drinke of this cuppe ye shall shew the death of the lord till he come verse and discerne his bodie secondly true faith in christe for euery man receiueth so much as he beleeueth he receiueth heb for vnto vs was the gospell preached as also vnto them but the worde that they heard profited not them because it was not mined with faith in those that heard it furthermore true repentance of their sins esay he that killeth a bullocke is as if he slowe a man he that sacrificeth a sheepe as if he cut off a dogs necke he that offereth an oblation as if he offred s es bl d he that remembreth increase if he blessed e yes they haue chosen their owne waies and their le delighteth in their abominations psalm wash mine handes in innocencie o lorde and so come before thine altar the sacramentall relation which is in the lord supper is on this manner   things sensible bread wine the relation of the partes of the lord supper the bodie of christ the bloud of christ thinges spirituall the and i actions of the sensible and externall actions of the minister to take bread and wine in his handes to seale christ to beare the office of a mediator john god consecrate the bread and wine by repeating the promise and prayers made for that end to send christ to be a mediatour for which he was sealed from all eternitie breake bread and powre out wine the execrable passion of christ and effusion of his bloud giue the bread and wine into the receiuers hands to offer christ to all euen to the hypocrites but to giue him only to the true christians take the bread and cup in his hand to apprehend christ by faith the christian receiuer christian receiuer to eate the bread and drinke the wine for the nourishment of his bodie to apply christ vnto him that the true vnion amp communion with christ may be encreased this table is to be referred to this marke thirdly renued faith and repentance for daily and new sins committed vpon infirmitie because euery new sinne requireth a newe act both of repentance and faith and this renouation must be seene by our reconciliation of our selues to our neighbour for iniuries and wrongs matth if thou bring thy gifte to the altar and there remembrest that thy brother hath ought against thee ver leaue thy gifte before the altar and goe first be reconciled to thy brother then come and offer thy gift if thou canst come furnished with these things absteine not from the lord table by reason of thy many infirmities it being thus prepared thou feelest that thou hast a corrupt and rebellious heart know this that then thou article well disposed to the lord table whe thou article liuely touched with a sense of thy crooked disposition luke the spirite of the lorde is vpon me because he hath annointed me that i should preach the gospell to the poore he hath sent me that i should heale the broken hearted that i should preach deliuerance to the captiues and recouering of sight to the blinde that i should set at libertie them that are bruised matth he answered and saide i am not sent but to the lost sheepe of the house of israell the lordes supper is a medicine to the diseased and languishing soule and therefore man must as well seeke to purifie and heale their hearts in it as to bring pure and sound hearts vnto it if thou feele in thy selfe some great defect and want of faith pray vnto god earnestly that he will vouchsafe to encrease it marke the father of the child crying with teares saide lord i beleeue helpe mine vnbeliefe if thou canst not doe this thy selfe vse the ayde of the faithfull which may by their faith carry thee as man did the sicke of the palsie vpon their shoulders and layd him before christ mark if thou come not furnished on this manner to the lord table thou shalt be adiudged guiltie of the bodie amp bloud of christ as he is guiltie of high treason who doth counterfeit or clippe the princes coyne corinthian he that eateth this bread and drinketh this cuppe vnworthily shalbe guiltie of the bodie and bloud of christ we haue hitherto declared the out warde meanes whereby god decree is executed nowe followe the decrees of executing the same the degrees are in number two the loue of god and the declaration of his loue ephesian to the praise of the glorie of his grace wherewith he hath made vs accepted in his bloud verse and hath opened vnto vs the mysterie of his well according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in him god loue is that whereby god dooth freely loue all such as are chosen in christ iesus though in themselues altogether corrupt john we loue him because he loued vs first rom god setteth out his loue towards vs seeing that while we were yet sinners christ dyed for vs verse for if when we were enemy we were reconciled to god by the death of his son much more we being reconciled shalbe saued by his life the declaration of god loue is two folde the first towards infantes elected to saluation the second towards man of ryper yeares the declaration of god loue towards infants is on this manner infants already elected albeit they in the womb of their mother before they were borne or presently after depart this life they i say being after a secrete and vnspeakeable manner by god spirit engraffed into christ obtaine eternall saluation corinthian by one spirite we are all baptized into one bodie whether iewes or grecians or bonde or free and haue beene all made to drinke into one spirite luke the angell answered and said vnto her the holy ghost shall come vpon thee and the power of the most high shall ouershadowe thee therefore also that holy thing which shalbe borne of thee shalbe called the son of god and it came to passe as elizabeth heard the salutation of marie the babe sprange in her belly and elizabeth was filled with the holy ghost verse and his mouth was opened immediately and his tongue loosed and he spake and praised god ver and the child grew and waxed strong in spirite ie before i formed thee in the wombe i knewe thee and before thou camest out of the wombe i sanctified thee the declaration of god loue in those of yeares of discretion hath especially foure degrees rom corinthian the first degree is an effectuall calling whereby a sinner being seuered from the worlde is entertayned into god familie ephess and came and preached peace to you which were a farre off and to them that were neere now therefore ye are no more strangers and forreners but citizen with the saintes and of the houshold of god of this there be three partes the first is election which is a separation of a sinner from the cursed estate of all mankinde ioh if ye were of the world the world would loue his owne but because yee are not of the world but i haue chosen you out of the world therefore the world hateth you the second is the donation or free gift of the father whereby he bestoweth the sinfull man vpon christ amp christ againe vpon the sinfull man rom he spared not his owne son but gaue him for vs esay vnto vs a child is born amp vnto vs a son is giuen ioh thou hast giuen him power vpon all flesh that he should giue eternal life to al them who thou hast giuen him v i haue declared thy name to the me which thou gauest me out of the world thine they were and thou gauest them me and they kept thy word ver now they know that all thinges what so euer thou hast geuen me are of thee ioh my father which gaue them me is greater then all and none is like to take them out of my fathers handes the third is an vnion or coniunction which is the ingraffing of such as are to bee saued into christ and their growing vp together with him so that after a peculiar manner christ is made the head and euerie repentant sinner a member of his mysticall bodie ioh i pray not for these alone but for them also which shall beleeue in me thorough the word ver that they all may be one as thou o father article in me and i in thee euen that they may be also one in vs ephesian we are members of his bodie of his flesh and of his bones ioh i am that true vine and my father is the husbandman euery branch th beareth not fruit in me he taketh away and euery one that beareth fruite he purgeth it that it may bring forth more fruit ephesians built vpon the foundation of the prophets and apostles whose corner stone is iesus christ himselfe in whom all the building coupled together groweth vnto an holy temple in the lord in whom ye are also built together to be the habitation of god by the spirite this albeit it be a most neere and reall vnion yet we must not thinke that it by touching ture or as it were by souldering of one soule with another neither by a bare agreement of the soules among themselues but by the comunion amp operation of the same spirite which being by nature nite is of sufficient ability to conioyne those things together which are of themselues far distant from ech other the like we see in the soule of man which coioyneth the head with the foote ephesian pet whereby most great and precious promises are giuen vnto vs that by them ye should be partakers of the godly nature in that ye flee the corruption which is in the worlde through lust philipp jf there be any consolation in christ if any comfort of loue if any fellowship of the spirite ampc god executeth this effectuall calling by certain meanes the first is the sauing hering of the word of god a which is when the said word outwardly is preached to such an one as is both dead in his sins and doth not so much as dream of his saluation b and of all the law shewing a man his sinne and the punishment thereof which is eternall death afterward the gospell shewing saluation by christ iesus to such as beleeue c and inwardlye the eyes of the minde are enlightened d the hart amp eares opened that he may see hear and vnderstand the preaching of the woord of god a ezech when i passed by thee i sawe thee polluted in thine owne blood and i saide vnto thee when thou wast in thy blood thou shalt line esay ho euery one that thirsteth come ye to the water and ye that haue no siluer come buye and and eate come i say and buye wine and milke without siluer and without money john as many as receiued him to them he gaue this priuiledge that they should become the sonnes of god namely to them which beleeued in his name b rom i knew not sinne but by the lawe for j had not known lust except the law had said thou shalt not lust c ioh but the annointing which ye receiued of him dwelleth in you and ye neade not that any man teach you but as the same annointing teacheth you of all things and it is true and is not lying and as it taught you yee shall abide in him d act a certaine woman named lydia a seller of purple of the citie of the thyatirians a worshipper of god heard vs whose hart god opened that she attended to the things that paul spake psalm thou article not delighted with sacrifice and burnt offrings but mine cares hast thou opened ioh no man can come vnto me except the father which hath sent me draw him and j will raise him vp at the last day esay the lord hath called thee being as a woman forsaken and afflicted in spirit and as a young wife when thou wast refused saith the lord the secod is the mollifying of the hart the which must be brused in peeces that it may be fitte to receiue god sauing grace offered vnto it eze i wil giue them one hart and j wil put a new spirite within their bowels and j will take the stonie hart out of their body and wil giue them a hart of flesh there are for the brusing of this stonye harte foure principal hammers the knowledge of the law of god the knowledge of sin both original and actual and what punishment is due vnto them corruption or pricking of the hart namelye a sence and feeling of the wrath of god for the same sinnes an holy desperation of a mans own power in the obtaining of eternall life acts when they heard these thinges they were pricked in hart and saide vnto peter and the rest of the apostles man and brother what shall we doe ver peter said vnto the repent and be baptized euery one of you in the name of jesus into the remission of sinnes and ye shall receiue the gift of the holy ghost luke then he came to him selfe and said how many hired servant at my fathers haue bread enough and dye for hunger ver i will rise and goe to my father and say vnto him father i haue sinned against heauen and before thee verse and am no more worthie to be called thy son make me as one of thy hired servant ampc mat he answered and saide i am not sent but to the lost sheepe of jsraell the third is faith which is a miraculous and supernaturall facultie of the hart apprehending christ iesus being applyed by the opperation of the holy ghost and receiuing him to it self ioh jesus saide vnto them i am the bread of life he that commeth vnto me shall neuer hunger and he that beleeueth in me shall neuer thirst rom what shall we say then the gentiles which followed not righteousnes haue attained vnto righteousnes euen the righteousnes which is of faith christ is receiued when euery seuerall parson doth particularly apply vnto himselfe christ with his merites by an inward perswasion of the hart which commeth none other way but by the effectuall certificate by the holy ghost concerning the mercye of god in christ iesus corinthian we haue receiued not the spirite of the world but the spirit which is of god that we might know the thinges that are giuen to vs of god ezech i will powre the spirite of grace vpon the house of dauid and vpon the inhabitant of ierusalem and they shall looke vnto me whome they haue wounded rom his spirite beareth witnes to our spirite that we are the sonnes of god ephe in whom also ye haue trust after that ye heard the word of truth euen the gospell of your saluation wherin also after that ye beleeued ye were sealed with the holy spirite of promise corinthian in the work of faith there are degrees or motions of the heart linked and vnited together and are worthie the consideration of euery christian the first is knowledge of the gospell by the illumination of god spirite esay by his knowledge shall my righteous servant iustifie many john this is life eternall that they know thee to be the onely very god and whom thou hast sent iesus christ to this in such as are truely humbled is annexed a serious meditation of the promises in the gospell stirred vp by the sencible feeling of their owne beggerie and after the foresaid knowledge in all such as are enlightened commeth a generall faith whereby they subscribe to the trueth of the gospell heb nto vs was the gospell preached as also vnto them but the word that they heard profited not them because it was not mixed with faith in those that heard it tim hauing faith amp a good conscience which some haue put away and as concerning the faith haue made shipwracke tim who will that all man should be saued and come vnto the knowledge of the trueth this knowledge if it be more full and perfect is called in greeke that is the full assurance of vnderstanding column th their harts might be comforted and they knit togither in loue and in all riches of the full assurance of vnderstanding to know the mystery of god euen the father and of christ rom j know and am perswaded through the lord jesus that there is nothing vncleane of it selfe luke for as much as many haue taken in hand to set forth the story of those things whereof we are fully perswaded thes our gospell was vnto you not in word only but also in power and in the holy ghost and in much assurance the second is hope of pardon wherby a sinner albeit he yet feeleth not that his sinnes are certainly pardoned yet he beleeueth that they are pardo ble luke i wil goe vnto my father and say father i haue sinned against heauen and against thee and a more worthie to be called thy son make me as one of thine hi ed servant the third is an hungring and thirsting after that grace which is offered to him in christ iesus as a man hungreth and thirsteth after meate and drink john and revelation and he saide vnto me it is done i am oe and the beginning and the end i will giue to him that is a thirste of the well of the water of life freely mat blessed are they which hunger and thirst after righteousnes for they shalbe satisfied the fourth is the approching to the throne of grace that there flying from the terrour of the lawe he may take hold of christ and finde fauour with god heb let vs therefore goe boldelye to the throne of grace that he may receiue mercie and finde grace to helpe in time of neede this approching hath two partes the first is an humble confession of sinnes before god particularly if they be knowen sinnes and generally if vnknown this done the lord forth with remitteth all our sinnes psalm i thought i will confes against my selfe my wickednes vnto the lord and thou forgauest the punishment of my sinne selah sam dauid said to nathan j haue sinned against the lord wherfore nathan said to dauid the lord hath taken awaye thy sinne thou shalt not dye luke the second is the crauing pardon of some sins with vnspeakable sighes and in perseuerance luke act repent of this wickednes amp pray god th if it be possible the thought of thine hart may be forgiuen thee rom the spirite helpeth not infirmities for we know not what to pray as we ought but the spirit it selfe maketh request for vs with sighes which can not be expressed the fift arising of the former is an especiall perswasion imprinted in the hart by the holye ghost wherby euery faithfull man doth particularlye apply vnto himselfe those promises which are made in the gospel mat they brought vnto him a man sick of the palsie and when jesus saw their faith he saide vnto the sicke of the palsie son be of good comfort thy sinnes are forgiuen thee mat o woman great is thy faith be is vnto thee as thou desirest this perswasion is and ought to be in euery one euen before he haue any experience of god mercies mat a woman a cananite came out of the same coastes and cryed saying vnto him haue mercye on me o lord the son of dauid my daughter is miserably vexed with a diuell ampc ioh iesus said vnto him thomas because thou hast seen me thou beleeuest blessed are they which haue not seene and haue beleeued heb faith is the ground of things hoped for and the euidence of things which are not seene in philosophie we first see a thing true by experience and afterward giue our assent vnto it as in naturall philosophie i am perswaded that such a water is hot because when i put mine hand into it i perceiue by experience an hot qualitie but in the practise of faith it is quite contrary for first we must consent to the word of god resisting all doubt and diffidence and afterward will an experience and feeling of cofort follow cro put your trust in the lord your god and ye shall be assured beleue his prophets and ye shal prosper they therfore do very ill who are still in a doubt of their saluation because as yet they feele not in theselues especiall motions of god spirite thus much concerning the way which god vseth in begetting of faith there are beside this notable degrees of faith the one is the lowest and as i maye speake the possitiue degree the other is the highest or superlatiue the lowest degree of faith is called a little or weak faith like a grain of mustard seed or smoking flaxe which can neither giue out heat nor flame but onely smoake math his disciples awaked him saying saue master we perish and he said vnto them why are ye fearefull o ye of little faith mathew jf ye haue faith as much as a gra ne of mustarde feede ye shall say vnto this mountaine mooue and it shall remoue esay the smoking flaxe shal be not quench faith is then saide to be weake and feeble when as of those fiue degrees aboue mencioned either the first which is knowledge or the fift which is application of the promises is verye feeble the rest remaining strong rom one beleeueth that he maye eate all thinges and another which is weake eateth hearbes ver let not him that eateth despise him that eateth not and let not him which eateth not iudge him which eateth for god hath receiued him the apostles although they beleeued that christ was that son of the liuing god yet they were ignorant of his death and of his resurrection mat ioh mat luke they vnderstoode not that woorde for it was hidde from them so that they could not perceiue it actes they asked him saying lord wilt thou restore at this time the kingdome of jsraell for the better knowledge of this kinde of faith we must obserue these two rules i a serious desire to beleeue and an endeauour to obteine god fauour is the head of faith mat bless are they which hunger amp thirst after righteousnes for they shalbe satisfied revelation i will giue to him that is a thirst of the well of the water of life freely psalm he will fulfill the desire of the that f de him he also will heare their crye and will saue them i in such as begin to be renued the wil lieth not idle but being moued by the holy ghost striueth with doubtfulnes and distrust and endeuoureth to giue her assent to the sweete promises made in the gospell and in the sence of her weaknes desireth assistance from aboue ii god doth not despise the least sparke of faith if so be it by little and little doo encrease and man vse the meanes to increase the same luke the apostles saide vnto the lord encrease our faith verse and the lord saide if ye had faith as much as a graine of mustard seede and should say vnto this mulberye tree plucke thy selfe vp by the rootes and plant thy selfe in the sea it should euen obey you man must therefore stirre vp his faith by meditation of god woord serious prayers and other exercises belonging vnto faith the highest degree of faith is a full assurance which is not onely certaine and true but also a full perswasion of the hart whereby a christian maketh full and resolute account that god loueth him and that he will giue to him by name christ and all his graces pertaining to eternall life romans neither did he doubt of the promise of god through vnbeleefe but was shrengthened in the faith and gaue glory to god verse being fully assur hat he which had promised was able also to doo it rom i am perswaded that neither life nor death ampc can seperate vs from the loue of god which is in christ iesus psalm doubtles kindenes and mercy shall follow me all the daies of my life sam thy servant shew both the lion and the beare therfore this vncircumcised philistine shalbe as one of them seeing he hath railed on the hoste of the liuing god man commeth to hie degree after the sence obseruation and long experience of god fauour and loue the second degree is iustification whereby such as beleue are accounted iust before god through the obedience of christ iesus corinthian he hath made him to be sinne for vs which knew no sin that we should be made the righteousnes of god in him corinthian rom as by one mans disobedience many were made sinners so by the obedience of one that is jesus christ ver shall many also be made righteous iustification hath two parres remission of sins and imputation of christs righteousnes remission of sins is that parte of iustification wherby he that beleeueth is freede from the guilte and punishment of sinne by the merites of the passion of christ column you hath he now reconciled in the body of his flesh through death to make you holye and vnblameable and without fault in his sight pet who in his own flesh bare our sinnes in his body on the tree that we being deliuered from sin should liue in righteousnes by whose stripes ye were healed imputation of righteousnes is the other part of iustification whereby such as beleeue hauing the guilt of their sins couered are accounted iust in the sight of god through christs righteousnes corinthian psalm blessed is he whose wickednes is forgiuen and whose sin is couered rom the whole chap philipp i haue counted all things losse and doe iudge them to be domage that i might win christ and might be found in him that is not hauing mine owne righteousnes which is by the law but that which is through the faith of christ euen the righteousnes which is of god through faith the forme of iustification is as it were a kinde of translatio of the beleeuers sins vnto christ and againe christs righteousnes vnto the beleeuer by meanes of god diuine imputation as is apparant in this picture following diagram linking christ a sauior just with passion obedience holines and iustified and the unjust sinner to be saved with guilt disobedience corruption and a sinner iustification hath annexed vnto it adoption wherby al such as are predestinated to be odopted receiue power to be actually accounted the sonnes of god by christ ephe who hath predestinate vs to be adopted through iesus christ vnto himselfe according to the good pleasure of his will by meanes of adoption god hath bestowed many notable priuiledges vpon his children i they are the lord heires apparant rom if we be children we be also heires euen the heires of god ii they are fellow heires with christ yes kings rom revelation and made vs kings amp priests euen to god his father iii all their afflictions yes euen their wantes and offences are turned to fatherly chastisementes inflicted vpon them for their good rom we know that all thinges worke together for the best vnto the that loue god ver it is written for thy sake are we killed all the day long we are counted as sheepe for the slaughter ver neuertheles in all these things we are more then conquerours through him that loued vs psalm i will visite their transgression with the rod and their iniquitie with strokes v yet my louing kindenes wil i not take from him corinthian there was giuen vnto me a prick in the flesh the messenger of satan to buffet mee because i should not be exalted out of measure sam i wil be to him a father and he shall be to me a son and if he sinne i wil chasten him with the rod of man and with the plagues of the children of man iiii they haue dominion ouer all creatures corinthian whether it be paul or apollos or cephas or the worlde or life or death whether they be things present or things to come euen all are yours heb thou madest him little inferiour to the angels thou crownedst him with glory and honour and hast set him aboue the workes of thine hands thou hast put all things in subiection vnder his feete last of all they may haue the angels as ministring spirits attending on them for their good heb are they not all ministring spirites sent forth to minister for their sakes which shalbe heires of saluation psalm the angels of the lord pitch round about them that feare him and deliuereth them the third degree is sanctification wherby such as beleeue being deliuered from the tirannye of sinne are by little and little renued in holinesse and righteousnes ioh whosoeuer is born of god sinneth not for his seede remaineth in him neither can he sinne because he is borne of god rom there is no condemnation to those which are in christ jesus which walke not after the flesh but after the spirite sanctification hath two paates mortification and viuification the mortification of sinne is the firste parte of sanctification whereby the power of sin is abated amp crucified in the faithful ro how shal we that are dead to sin liue yet therein know ye not that all we which haue beene baptized into jesus christ bene baptized into his death we are buried then with him by baptism into his death that like as christ was raised vp from the dead by the glory of the father so we also should walk in newnes of life eccl gal they which are christs haue crucified the flesh with the affections and lustes thereof the means that work mortification is the death and buriall of christ from whence proceedeth such a vertue as doth both keep vnder the strength that it canot break out as it would and in man as it were in a graue doth cause it to dye amp not putrifie rom our olde man is crucified with him that the body of sinne might be destroyed viuification is the second parte of sanctification wherby inherent holynes being begun is still augmented and enlarged first we receiue the firste fruites of the spirit then a continual encrease of the ephe be renued in the spirit of your minde v and put on the new man which after god is created in righteousnes and true holynes ephesians and you that he quickned that were dead in trespasses and sinnes gal thus j liue yet not i now but christ in me and in that i now liue by the flesh i liue by the faith of the son of god who hath loued me and giuen himselfe for me rom we which haue the first fruites of the spirite euen we doo sigh in our selues waiting for the adoption euen the redemption of our body corinthian the first man adam was made a liuing soule and the second man adam was made a quickned spirite the efficient cause of viuification is the holye ghost who doth by his diuine power conuey himselfe into the beleeuers harts and in them createth holines iob then will he haue mercy vpon him and will say deliuer him that he goe not downe into the pit for i haue receiued a reconciliation then shal his flesh be as fresh as a childes and shal return as in the daies of his youth rom now ye are not in the flesh but in the spirit because the spirit of god dwelleth in you but if any man haue not the spirite of christ the same is not his ver but if the spirit of him that raised vp iesus from the dead dwell in you be that raised vp christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortall body because that his spirite dwelleth in you the preseruatiue of viuificaton is a vertue deriued from christes resurrection to those that are quickned which maketh them to rise vp to newnes of life philipp that j may know him and the vertue of his resurrection furthermore this inherent holines is to be distinguished into parts according to the seuerall faculties of the bodie and soule of man thessa the very god of peace sanctifie you throughout and i pray god that your whole spirit soule and bodye may be kept blameles vntil the coming of our lord iesus christ i the holynes of the minde which is the illumination thereof to the knowledge of the will of god coloss we cease not to pray for you and to desire that ye might be fullye filled with knowledge of his will in all wisedome and spirituall vnderstanding corinthian to one is giuen by the spirite the speach of wisdome to another the speach of knowledge by the same spirite illumination is either spirituall vnderstanding or spirituall wisedome spirituall vnderstanding is an illumination of the minde wherby it acknowledgeth the knowen truth of the word of god spirituall wisedome is also an illumination of the minde whereby the same trueth is applied to the good ordering of particular both things amp actions as persons place and times require these two haue these effects which follow to discerne betweene good and euill heb strong meat belongeth to them that are of age which through long custome haue their wits exercised to discearne both good and euill philipp that ye may discearne things that differ one from another to discerne of spirits ioh derely beloued beleeue not euery spirite but trie the spirites whether they are of god thes trie all things and keepe that which is good acts these were more noble man then they which were at thessalonica which receiued the word with all readines and searched the scriptures dayly whether these things were so to meditate vpon the woord and workes of god psalm but his delight is in the law of god and in that law doth exercise himselfe day and night psalm j wil meditate in thy precepts and consider thy waies psalm the whole psalme to discerne and acknowledge a mans own inward blindnes psalm teach me o lord the way of thy statutes and i wil keep it vnto the end ver open mine eyes that i may see the wonders of thy law ii the sanctitie of the memorie is an abilitie to keepe a good thing when it is offered to the minde and as neede serueth to remember it psalm i haue hid thy promise in mine heart that i might not sinne against thee psalm i will prayse the lord who hath giuen me counsell my reynes also teach me in the nights luke his mother kept all these thinges in her heart iii the sanctitie of conscience which is a grace of god wherby a mans conscience excuseth him for all his sinnes

of them that fight spiritually the warriours are the tempter and the christian souldier ephesian for we wrestle not against flesh and bloud but against principality against powers and against the worldly gouernours the princes of the darkenesse of this world against spirituall wickednesses which are in hie places the tempter is the prince or his helpers the prince is satan and his angels which are spirituall wickednesses in hie things his helpers are the flesh and the world the conflict of all these is temptation wherby man is prouoked to commit such wickednesse as is hurtfull to the saluation of his soule pet dearely beloued i beg you as strangers amp pilgrimes absteine from fleshly lusts which fight against the soule in the souldier two things are to be considered his resisting

me my grace is sufficient for thee for my power is made perfect through weakenesse verie gladly therefore will i reioyce rather in ine infirmitie that the power of god may dwell in me verse therefore j take pleasure in infirmities in reproches in necessities in persecutions in anguish for christes whom i am weake th n am i strong assaultes are threefold the first is about the christian mans effectuall calling the temptation is the enterprise of the deuill to make blinde mans minde and to harden his heart least the word of god should worke in him to saluation matth and as he sowed some fell by the way side and the foules came and deuoured them vp verse and some fell vpon stan ground where they had not much earth and a o they sprange vp because they had no depth of earth verse and when the sun rose vp they were parched and for lacke of rooting withered away verse and some fell among thornes and the thornes sprung vp and choked them ver whensoeuer a man beareth the word of the kingdome and vnderstandeth it not the euill one commeth and catcheth away that which was sowen in his heart and this is he which hath receiued the seede by the way side a resistance in those that are called is wrought by the the spirite of god that causeth man to lend their eares to heare and doth ingraffe the worde in their heartes that the immortall seede of regeneration may spring in them psalme john acts iam wherefore lay apart all filthinesse and superfluitie of maliciousnesse and receiue with meckenesse the worde that is graffed in you which is able to saue your soules pet seeing your soules are purified in obeying the truth through the spirit to loue brotherly without faining loue one another with a pure heart feruently john whosoeuer is borne of god sinneth not for his seed remaineth in him neither can he sinne because he is borne of god a resistance in those that are to be called is when in a sincere heart they doe ioyne the word which they haue heard with faith luke but that which fell in good ground are they which with an honest and good heart heare the word and keepe it and bring forth fruit with patience heb heere are certaine preseruatiues to be noted i premeditation of the power and vse of the worde ecclesiastes take heed to thy feete when then entrest into the house of the lord and be more neere to heare then to giue the sacrifice of fooles for

wordes be few ii diligent attention of the minde act iii an hungering desire of the heart ioh now in the last and great day of the feast iesus stood and cried saying if any man thirst let him come to me and drinke iiii integritie of life psalm v the casting away of euill affections iam and be ye doers of the word and not hearers onelie deceiuing your owne selues vi the inward consent and agreement of the heart with the word preached act vii an hiding of the word in the heart least we should sinne psalm i haue hid thy word in mine heart that i might not sinne against thee viii a trembling at the presence of god in the assembly of the church isa for all these things hath mine hand made and all these things haue been saith the lord and to him will i looke euen to him that is poore and of a contrite spirite and trembleth at my words act then sent i for thee immediatlie and thou hast well done to come now therefore are we all heere present before god to heare all things that are commanded thee of god the fall is either a coldnes in receiuing the word and a neglect thereof or else a falling into errours the remedie for this is subiection which must be made to the iudgement and censure of the brother and ministers revelation chap verse i know thy workes that thou article neither colde nor hote i would thou werest either cold or hot galat chap verse timot chap verse of whom is hymeneus and alexander whome i haue deliuered vnto satan that they might learne not to blaspheme the second assault is concerning faith the temptation is an illusion which the deuill casteth into the hearts of godlie man as when he saith thou article not of the number of the elect thou article not iustified thou hast no such thou must certenly be condemned for thy sins mat then came to him the tempter and saide if thou be the son of god command that these stones be made bread helpes which the deuill abuseth for the strengthening of such illusions are these i aduersitie as dangers losses

alreadie at hand the resistance is made by a true faith applying christ with all his merites particularly after this maner i assuredly beleeue that i shall not be condemned amp that i am elected amp iustified in christ isaiah he shall see the trauaile of his soule amp shall be satisfied by his knowledge shall my righteous servant iustifie many for he shall beare their iniquities rom for i am perswaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principality nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor height nor depth nor any other creature shall be able to separate vs from the loue of god which is in christ iesus our lord the preseruatiue is in temptation not to behold faith but the obiect of faith which is christ philipp not as though i had alreadie attained vnto it either were alreadie perfect but i follow if that i may comprehend that for whose sake also i am comprehended of christ iesus one thing i doe i forget that which is behinde and endeuour my selfe to that which is before and follow hard toward the marke for the price of the hie calling of god in christ iesus john and as moses lift vp the serpent in the wildernesse so must the son of man be lift vp the falling is doubtfulnesse and distrust of our election and of god mercie psalm j called to remembrance my song in the night i communed with mine owne heart and my spirite searched diligently will the lord absent himselfe for euer and will he shew no more fauour is his mercie cleane gone for euer doth his promise faile for euermore ps my god my god why hast thou forsaken me and article so farre

he that hath begunne this good worke in ou will performe it vntill the day of iesus christ luke and the apostles saide vnto the lord increase our faith the second is an holy meditation which is manifolde i that it is the comandement of god that we should beleeue in christ ioh this is then his commandement that we beleeue in the name of his son iesus christ and loue one another as he gaue commandement ii that the euangelicall promises are indefinite and do exclude no man vnlesse peraduenture any man do exclude himselfe isa ho euery one that thirsteth come yee to the water and yee that

sinne we haue an aduocate with the father iesus christ the iust verse and he is the reconciliation for our sinnes and not for ours onely but also for the sinnes of the whole worlde psalm let jsrael waite on the lord for with the lord is mercie and with him is great redemption vi that god measureth the obedience due vnto him rather by the affection and desire to obey then by the acte and perfourmance of it rom for they that are after the flesh sauour the things of the flesh but they that are after the spirit the things of the spirit ver because the wisedom of the flesh is enimitie

law that when i would do good euill is present with me for i delite in the lawe of god concerning the inner man vii when one sinne is forgiuen all the rest are remitted also for remission being giuen once without any prescription of time is giuen for euer rom for the gifts and calling of god are without repentance actes to him also giue all the prophets witnesse that through his name all that beleeue in him shall receiue remission of sinnes viii that grace and faith are not taken away by falles of infirmitie but thereby are declared and made manifest rom moreouer the law entred therevpon that the offence should abound neuerthelesse when sinne abounded there grace abounded much more corinthian for this thing i besought the lord thrise that it might depart from me the third assault is concerning sanctification the temptation is a prouoking to sinne according as the disposition of euery man and as occasion shall offer it selfe chronicle and satan stoode vp against israel and prouoked dauid to number israel john and when supper was done the deuill had now put in the hart of iudas iscariot simons son to betray him in this temptation the deuill doth wonderfully diminish and make lesse those sins which man are about to commit partly by obiecting the mercy of god and partly by couering or hiding the punishment which is due for the sinne then there are helpes to further the deuill in his temptation first the flesh which lusteth against the spirite sometimes by begetting euill motions and affections and sometimes by ouerwhelming and oppressing the good intents and motions gal for the flesh lusteth against the spirite amp the spirite against the flesh and these are contrarie one to another so that ye can not doe the same things that ye would verse moreouer the works of the flesh are manifest which are adulterie fornication vncleannes wantonnes ver idolatry witchcraft hatred debate emulations wrath contentions seditions heresies verse envy murthers drankennesse gluttonie and such like whereof i tell you before as i also haue tolde you before that they which doo such thinges shall not inherite the kingdome of god iames but euerye man is tempted when he is

conuersation in time past in the lustes of our flesh in fulfilling the will of the flesh and of the minde and were by nature the children of wrath as well as others john for all that is in the world as the lustes of the flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride of life is not of the father but is of the worlde resistance is made by the desire of the spirite which woorketh good motions and affections in the faithfull and driueth foorth the euill galla but the fruite of the spirite is loue ioy peace long suffering gentlenes goodnes faith verse meekenes teemperancie against such there is no law ver for they that are christs haue crucified the flesh with the affections and the lustes thereof verse let vs not be desirous of vaine glory prouoking one another en ying one another the preseruatiues are these whereby man are strengthened in resisting i to account no sinne light or small gal a little leauen doth leauen the whole lumpe rom for the wages of sinne is death but the gift

sinne against god in this temptation the fall is when a man being preuented falleth into some offence gal here satan doth wonderfullye make greeuous the offence committed and doth accuse and terrifie the offender with the iudgements of god mat then when iudas which betraied him saw that he was condemned he repented himselfe and brought againe the thirtie peeces of siluer to the cheefe preests and elders v saying i haue sinned betraying the innocent blood but they saide what is that to vs see thou to it verse and when he had cast down the siluer peeces in the temple he departed and went and

degree of the declaration of god loue is glorification rom glorification is the perfect transforming of the saints into the image of the son of god philipp who shall change our vile body that it may be fashioned like vnto his glorious body according to the working wherby he is able euen to subdue all things vnto himselfe corinthian it is sowen a naturall body and is raised a spirituall bodie there is a naturall bodye and there is a spirituall bodye as it is also written the first man adam was made a liuing soule the last adam was made a quickening spirite verse and as we haue borne the image of the earthly so shall we beare the image of the heauenly psalm i wil beholde thy face in righteousnes and when i awake i shalbe satisfied with thine image the beginning of glorification is in death but it is not accomplished and made perfect before the last day of iudgement the death of the elect is but a sleepe in christ a wherby the body and soule is seuered the body b that after corruption it may rise to greater glorie the soule that it c being fully sanctified may d immediatlye after departure from the bodye be transported into the kingdome of heauen a corinthian if christ

flesh the lawe of sinne d luke he saide to iesus lord remember me when thou commest into thy kingdome verse then iesus saide to him this day shalt thou be with me in paradise revelation then i heard a voice from heauen saying vnto me write blessed are the dead which hereafter dye in the lord euen so saith the spirite for they rest from their labours and their workes follow them the faithfull neede not to feare death because christ hath taken away the sting thereof corinthian o death where is thy sting o graue where is thy victory ver the sting of death is sinne and the strength of sinne is the law ver but thankes be to god which hath giue vs victory through our lord iesus christ heb that he might deliuer all them which for feare of death were all their life time subiect to bondage soules being once in heauen remaine there till the last day of iudgement where they partly magnifie the name of god and partlye doe waite and praye for the consummation of the kingdome of glorie and full felicitie in body and soule revelation and when he had taken the booke the foure beastes and the foure and twenty elders fell downe before the lambe hauing euery one harpes and golden vials full of odours which are the praiers of the saintes verse and they sang a new song saying thou article worthie to take the booke and to open the seales thereof because thou wast killed and hast redeemed vs to god by the blood out of euerye kinred and tongue and people and nation revelation i heard the voice of harpers harping with their harpes ver and they sung as it were a new song before the throne revelation and they cryed with a lowd voice saying how long lord holy and true doost not thou iudge and auenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth the last day of iudgement shall be on this manner i immediatlye before the comming of christ a the powers of heauen shall be shaken the sun and moone shall be darkened and the stars shall seeme to fall from heauen b at which sight the elect then liuing shall reioyce but the reprobate shall shake euery ioynt of them a mat immediatly after the tribulation of those dayes shall the sun be darkened the moone shall not giue her light the starres shall fall from heauen and the power of heauen shall be shaken verse and then shall appeare the signe of the son of man in heauen and then shall all the kinreds of the earth mourne and they shall see the son of man come in the cloudes of heauen with power and great glorye b luke mens hartes shall faile them for feare and for looking after those thinges which shall come on the worlde verse and when these thinges begin to come to passe then looke vp and lift vp your heads for your redemption draweth neere tim hence foorth is laid vp for me the crowne of righteousnes which the lord the righteous iudge shall giue me at that day and not to me onlye but vnto all the also that loue his appearing ii then the heauens being all set on fire shall with a noise like to that of chariot wheeles suddenly passe away and the elements with the earth and all therin shalbe consumed with fire pet looking for and hasting vnto the comming of the day of god by which the heauens being set on fire shalbe dissolued and the elements shall melt with heate ver but we looke for new heauens and a newe earth according to his promise wherin dwelleth all righteousnes at the same time when as all these thinges shall come to passe a the sound of the last trumpet shalbe heard sounded by the archangell b and christ shall come suddenly in the cloudes with power and glorie and a great traine of angels a matthew and he shal send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet thess the lord himselfe shall descend from heauen with a showte euen with the voice of the archangell and with the trumpet of god and the dead in christ shall rise first b matth thess then shall we which liue and remaine be caught vp with them also in the cloudes to meete the lord in the ayre and so shall we euer be with the lord iii now at the sound of the trumpet the elect which were dead shall arise with their body and those very body which were turned to dust and one part rent from another shall by the omnipotent power of god be restored and the soules of them shall descend from heauen and bee brought againe into those body as for a them which then shall be aliue they shall be changed in the twinckling of an eye and this mutation shall be in steed of death at that time the body shall receiue their full redemption b and all the body of the elect shall be made like the glorious bodie of christ iesus and therefore shall be spirituall immortall glorious and free from all infirmitie a corinthian we shall not all sleepe but we shall be chaunged in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last trumpet b verse it is sowen in dishonour it is raised in honour it is sowen in weakenesse it is raised in power verse it is sowen a naturall bodie it is raised a spirituall bodie ampc iiii last of all when they are all conuented before the tribunall seate of christ he will foorthwith place the elect seuered from the reprobate and taken vp into the ayre at his right hand and to them being written in the booke of life will hee pronounce this sentence come ye blessed of my father possesse the kingdome prepared for you from the foundation of the worlde matthew he shall set the sheepe on his right hand and the goates on the left thess revelation whosoeuer was not found written in the booke of life was cast into the lake of fire the last iudgement being once finished the elect shall enioy immediatly

vnto him that did subdue all things vnder him that god may be all in all and it is the reward of good workes not because workes can merite but by reason of god fauour who thus accepteth works and in respect of the merite of christes righteousnes imputed to the elect rom the wages of sinne is death but eternal life is the gift of god through iesus christ our lorde timoth revelation beholde i come shortly and my reward is with me to giue euery man according at his worke shall be blessednesse hath two partes eternall life and perfect glorie eternall life is that fellowship with god a whereby god himselfe is through the lambe christ life vnto the elect for in the kingdome of heauen the elect shal not need meate drinke sleepe aire heate colde phisicke apparrell or the light of the sun and moone b but in place of all these shall they haue in them god spirite by which immediately they shall be quickened for euer a john if any man loue me he will keepe my worde and my father will loue him and we will come vnto him and dwell with him john whosoeuer confesseth that iesus christ is the soone of god god dwelleth in him and hee in god revelation and i heard a voyce saying behold the tabernacle of god is with man and hee will dwell with them and they shall be his people and god himselfe shall be their god with them verse and that cittie hath no neede of sun or moone to shine in it for the glorie of god did light it amp the lambe is the light of it revelation in the middes of the streete of it and of either side of the river was the tree of life which bare twelue manner of fruits and gaue fruit euery moneth amp the leaues of the tree serued to heale the nation with verse and there shalbe no night there and they neede no candle or light of the sun for the lorde giueth them light and they shall reigne for euermor b corinthian rom if the spirit of him that raised vp iesus from the dead dwel in you he that raised vp christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortall body because that his spirit dwelleth in you perfect glorie is that wonderfull excellencie of the elect whereby they shall bee in a farre better estate then any heart can wish this glory consisteth in three pointes i in that they shall still behold the face of god which is his glorie and maiestie revelation and they shall see his face and his name shalbe in their foreheads psalm i will behold thy face in righteousnes and when i awake i shalbe satisfied with thine image ii in that they shalbe most like to christ namely iust holy vncorruptible glorious honourable excellent beautifull strong mightie and nimble ioh dearely beloued now are we the sonnes of god but yet it dooth not appeare what we shall be and we know that when he shall appeare we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is philip verse who shall change our vile bodie that it may be fashioned like vnto his glorious bodie according to the working whereby he is able euen to subdue all things to himselfe iii they shall inherit the kingdome of heauen yes the new heauens and new earth shalbe their inheritance pet god hath begotten you to an inheritance immortall and vndefiled and that fadeth not away reserued in heauen for you mat then shall the king say to them on his right hand come ye blessed of my father possesse a kingdome prepared for you before the foundations of the worlde were laide revelation thou hast made vs vnto our god kings and priests and we shall reigne on the earth revelation he that ouercommeth shall inherite all things and i will be his god and he shall be my sonn the fruite that commeth from both these parts of blessednesse is of two sorts eternall ioy and the perfect seruice of god psalm thou wilt shewe me the path of life in thy presence is the fulnesse of ioy and at thy right hand there are pleasures for euermore psalm they shall be satisfied with the fatnesse of thine house and thou shalt giue them drinke one of the river of thy pleasures verse for with thee is the well of life and in thy light shall we see light the parts of god seruice are praise amp thanksgiuing revelation and i heard a great voice out of heauen saying behold the tabernacle of god is with man and he will dwell with them and they shalbe his people and god himselfe shalbe their god with them chapter saying with a loude voyce worthie is the lambe that was killed to receiue power and riches and wisedome and strength and honour and glorie and praise ampc verse chapter the foure and twentie elders which sate before god on their seates fell vpon their faces and worshipped god saying wee giue thee thankes lord god almightie which article and which wast and which article to come for thou hast receiued thy great might and hast obtained thy kingdome the manner of perfourming this seruice is to worship god by god himselfe immediately in heauen there shall neither be temple ceremonie nor sacrament but all these wantes shall god himself supply together with the lambe that is christ reu i saw no temple therein for the lord god almightie and the lambe are the temple of it this seruice shalbe daily and without intermission reue they are in the presence of the throne of god and serue him day and night in his temple thus god in sauing the elect doeth clearely set foorth his iustice and mercie his iustice in that he punished the sins of the elect in his sonnes owne person his mercie in that he pardoned their sinne for the merites of his son ephesian that the eyes of your vnderstanding may be lightened that ye may know what the hope is of his calling and what the riches of his glorious inheritance is in his saints and what is the exceeding greatnes of his power toward vs which beleeue according to the working of his mightie power verse which he wrought in christ cha that ye may be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth and length and depth and height and to know the loue of christ all these things the lord himselfe hath thus decreed and in his good time will accomplish them to the glorious praise of his name prou the lord hath made all things for his owne sake yes euen the wicked for the day of euill there are two things requisite to obtaine saluation predestination amp the execution thereof predestination is a fore ordaining of the reasonable creature to grace in this life and glorie in the life to come sebast catta enchirid tract cap vlt this in regard of the first effects thereof which are vocation election and ordination to eternall life hath the cause of it in god namely his will but in regard of the last effect which is the execution of such an ordinance and the obtaining of eternall life it hath the cause of it from man but for the more euident declaration of this these seauen conclusions must be set downe i the predestination and reprobation of god doe not constraine or inforce any necessitie vpon the will of man ii god hath predestinated all man that is hee hath appointed and disposed all man so as they might obtaine eternall saluation iii man is neither by necessitie nor chance saued or condemned but voluntarily iiii god hath predestinated some other hath he reiected v those whom god hath predestinated by his absolute predestination which cannot be lost they shall infallibly die in grace but they which are predestinate by that predestination which being according to preset iustice may be lost by some mortall sinne which followeth are not infallibly saued but oftentimes such are condemned amp loose their crown amp glory hence ariseth that positio of theirs that hee which is iustified may be a reprobate and perish eternally torrensis aug confess book chap sect therefore predestination is not certaine seeing it may be lost vi god alone doeth know the certaine and set number of them which are predestinate vii there is one set number of them which are predestinate or reprooued and that can neither be encreased nor diminished the execution of predestination is either in infants or those of yeeres of discretion concerning infants the merite of christ is applied vnto them by baptisme rightly administred so that whatsoeuer in originall corruption may truly and properly be accounted for sinne it is not only as i may say not pared away or not imputed but vtterly taken away for there is nothing that god can hate in such as are renued concil trid sect can neuerthelesse they are vrged to confesse that there remaineth yet in such as are baptized concupiscence or the relikes of sinne the which seeing it is left in man for them to wrestle withall it hath not power to hurt such as yeeld not vnto it the execution of predestination in such as are of riper yeeres hath sixe degrees the first is vocation whereby man not for their owne merites but by god preuenting grace through christ are called to turne vnto god the second is a preparation to righteousnesse whereby man through the inherent power of free will doe apply themselues to sanctification after that the same power is stirred vp by the holy ghost for free will is onely somewhat diminished amp not extinguished and therefore so soone as the holy ghost toucheth amp enlighteneth the heart it worketh together with the same spirit freely assenting vnto the same this preparation hath seauen degrees biel book dist quest the first is faith which is a knowledge and an assent whereby man agree that those things are true which are deliuered concerning god and his will reuealed in the word of god this is the foundaion of iustification and prepareth the heart because it stirreth vp free wil that it may affect the hart with those motions by which it is prepared to iustification i the first act of faith is to apprehend the vglines of sinne and the wages thereof ii after this followeth a feare of god anger and of hell fire iii then begin man to dislike and in some sort to detest sinne from these ariseth a certaine disposition which hath annexed vnto it the merite of congruitie yet not immediate nor sufficient but imperfect iiii at the length faith returneth to the contemplation of god mercies and beleeueth that god is readie to forgiue sinnes by the infusion of charitie into those which are before sufficiently prepared and disposed v out of this contemplation proceedeth the act of hope whereby faith beginneth to desire and to waite on god as the cheefest good vi out of this act of hope ariseth loue whereby god is loued aboue all things in the world vii after this loue followeth a newe dislike and detestation of sinne not so much in regarde of feare of the punishment in hell fire as in regarde of the offence to god who is simply loued more then all other things viii after all these followeth a purpose of amendment of life and heere comes in the merit of congruitie that is sufficient or els the immediate sufficient and last disposition before the infusion of grace the third degree of predestination is the first iustification whereby man of vniustare are made iust not onely through the remission of their sinnes but also by a sanctification of the inwarde man by his voluntarie receiuing of grace and giftes the efficient cause of this iustification is the mercy of god and the meritorious passion of our sauiour christ whereby he purchased iustification for man the instrumentall cause is baptisme the formall cause is not that iustice which was inherent in christ but which he infuseth into man and that is especially hope and charitie the fourth degree is the second iustification whereby man are of iust made more iust the cause hereof is faith ioyned with good workes it is possible for such as are renewed to keepe the commandements and therefore it is false that is iust committeth so much as a veniall s ne in his best actions much lesse that he deserueth eternall death for the same the fift degree is the reparation of a sinner by the sacrament of penance the which is as it were the second boord after a shipwracke the cause why this reparation is necessarie is because man loose the grace of iustification by euery mortall sinne the last degree is the fruite of iustification which is nothing els but the meritorious rewarde of good workes namely eternall life which the good workes of such as are in the estate of grace do ex condigno that is of sufficient worthines deserue thus much concerning the degrees of executing predestination now followeth the applying of predestinatio particularly to the persons of man no man so long as he liueth in this mortall life ought so much to presume on the secret mysterie of god predestination as to determine vndoubtedly that he is in the number of them whom god hath ordeined to eternall happines for no man without especiall reuelation can knowe whome god hath chosen to be his heires sess c this doctrine of the church of rome is in truth a blasphemous doctrine amp to be no better accounted off then as a gibbet which is set vp to torment and to racke the consciences of man but i will onely touch in a worde the maine absurdities of this their doctrine i they make the name of predestination proper onely to the elect as though god had not predestinated the reprobate but onely foreknowen that such should bee reprobates fearing least in so doing they should make god a cause why the reprobates are damned but god foreknowledge may as well be termed such a cause as his predestination actes and augustine acknowledgeth god predestination as well in the reprobate as elect for in his booke of the citie of god chap he maketh all man cittizens of one of these two citties heauen and hell the cittizens of the one are predestinate to reigne with god perpetually the other to suffer eternall punishment with the devil and his angels ii they teach that god predestination is mutable and so as that hee whome god hath predestinate to life may for all that be condemned and he who in god foreknowledge is a reprobate may afterward obtaine eternall life all this is flat contrary for god hath vndoubtedly amp vnchangeably decreed what shal become of euery man who shalbe saued and who shalbe condemned rom the gifts and calling of god are without repentance math there shall arise false christes and false prophets and shall shew great signes and wonders so that if it were possible they should deceiue the very elect rom who shall lay any thing to the charge of god chosen it is god that instifieth verse who shall condemne it is christ which is dead ampc verse who shall separate vs from the loue of christ tim this foundation standeth sure the lord knoweth who are his againe if we graunt this it must needs follow that the foreknowledge of god may be deceiued his will altered amp his power weakned the which is most blasphemous to thinke or say finally by this meanes euery man should be vncertaine of his predestination to life and so that excellent and onely sure groundworke of full assurance o saluation is not onely sore shaken but quite and cleane ouerturned iii they teach that god hath predestinate all to saluation but paul thes faith plainely that there are certaine man ordeined to destruction who he distinguisheth from the elect verse tim in a great house there are not onely vessels of gold and of siluer but also of wood amp of earth and some for honour and some for dishonour math there are many called but fewe chosen and of so great a number of the iewes a remnant onely are saued this also serueth to set out god goodnes in that his benefit is not common to all man for we vsually admire nothing but that which is rare iiii they teach that predestination in regard of the last effect thereof hath his cause in man namely in his free will and workes for whom god hath foreseene that they would willingly receiue the grace of god offered them in christ amp which would lead their liues according to the commandements them did he predestinate not by reason of their workes but of his free grace yet so as that he had an eie or respect vnto the good works which they would do this their brainesick imagination paul vtterly ouerthroweth when he teacheth ephesians that god hath chosen the ephesians before the foundations of the world were laid not because he did foresee that they would be holy but that they should be holy amp without blame before him in loue tit furthermore seeing there is nothing either aboue god or greater then god it is palpable impietie to set downe any cause of his wil which should be either without or aboue himselfe therefore we doe not without good cause deny that god foreknowledge of faith and good workes in any can be a motiue why god should decree that some man should be saued v they say that baptisme truely administred doth not onely wash away the guiltinesse but also the corruption of original sinne in such sort as that after it is no more accounted a sinne but contrariwise it is most certaine that howsoeuer the guiltines of sinne be taken away yet that naturall pollution and corruption is not by and by extinguished but curbed as it were and kept vnder that it beare not a ful sway in man for if it were otherwise why should paul so bewaile his originall corruption as he doth i see saith he an other law in my members rebelling against the law of my minde and leading me captiue to the lawe of sinne which is in my members miserable man that i am who shall deliuer me from this bodie of death and the same paul rom calleth originall sinne the worker of death againe concupiscence is the very root of actuall sinne therefore it must needes be properly a sinne euen after baptisme iames lastly vnlesse concupiscence were of the same nature with sinne that vehement and earnest combate betweene the flesh and the spirit would presently cease vi they teach that the power of freewil which man receiued of god to doe that which is good is onely lessened before true conuersion and not extinguished and therfore that it is possible for man to prepare himselfe for iustification but the scripture saith that a naturall man cannot perceiue the things which are of god much lesse will them corinthian and the same we are taught ephesians that man are eake or sicke but dead in sinne vii w re as they say that the holy ghost doo stirre vp the will to well dooing it is apparan e for corinthian no man can say that iesus is lord but by the holy ghost and philipp it is god which worketh in you to doe and to will and no man can come to the son except the father draw him to conclude how ca there be any spark of goodnes in him who is anew to be fashioned after god in righteousnes amp true holines ephesians viii they teach that in man there is a natural preparation to grace and that it dooth by a merit which is of sufficient worthines deserue iustification this position sauoureth of more then sathanicall pride for can any man thinke vnlesse he be besides himselfe that hee who deserueth infinite thousand damnations can deserue the least droppe of grace corinthian ix they teach that that faith which they make to be the maine pillar of mans iustification is nothing else but a knowledge and illumination of the minde concerning the trueth of god word the which if it be so i would faine know why the devil might not be saued who hath this faith which is the ground of iustification with the amp yet albeit he haue this faith no man wil be so simple as to think that he is or can be accounted one of the faithfull x they maintaine that the loue of god commeth before reconciliation with god which is made in the worke of iustification but contrarily vnlesse we were surely perswaded of god loue to vs in the iustifying and sanctifying it were impossible for vs to loue god ioh we loue him because he loued vs first euen as we see that the sun by his heat must first warme the aire before the aire by any heate of his can warme our body xi they say that the formall cause of iustification is inherent iustice but albeit this infused and inherent iustice hath indeed his vse and commendations and reward neuerthelesse because it is in this life by reason of the flesh imperfect and polluted as esay speaketh it cannot stand before god iudgement seate and acquite any man from the sentence of condemnation so as he might become heyre of eternall life they will heere further say that god dooth accept this inherent righteousnes as a mercifull father this i graunt neuertheles god iustice must bee satisfied or else wee are damned wherefore christs obedience apprehended by a true and liuely faith is to be accounted the true essence of iustification in temptation and the combate with sinne and satan faith doth not reason thus now i haue charetie and inherent iustice and therfore god wil receiue me into his mercy but faith dooth rather looke directlye to the son of god who was sacrificed for vs and sitteth at the right hand of the father making intercession for vs to him dooth faith flie and is perswaded that for his cause our sinnes are pardoned and we reconciled to god and that we are accounted iust not by any inherent qualitie but by the merite of christs death and passion rom xii that deuised subtiltye of second iustification is a meere delusion of the deuill for first the word of god alloweth none other iustification but one there is one onelye iustice and one onelye satisfaction of the wrath of god secondlye if the increase of inherent iustice were a sufficient cause to distinguishe iustification they might as well make an hundreth iustifications as two thirdlye where as they say that man are iustified by good works it is both false and rediculous false all workes yes those which are done after we are receiued into god fauour are excluded from iustifying ephesians rom we conclude that a man is iustified by faith without the workes of the law where paul speaketh not of ceremoniall but of morall woorkes doone vnder grace the cause of the cause is the cause also of that which is caused but grace without works is the cause of predestination which is the cause of iustification therefore grace without woorkes shall much more be the cause of iustification i say it is also ridiculous because to affirme that inherent iustice maye be increased by good workes which are the fruite thereof is as if one should saye that the vine is more strong and liuelye by bearing grapes and that the inward brightnes of the sun is made greater by sending forth of beames that saying of luther is most true good works maketh not a man iust but a iust man maketh good workes for good fruit maketh not a good tree but declareth it to be good but a good tree must needs make good fruit xiii they affirme that euerye mortall sinne extinguisheth grace the which if we may beleeue god woord is farre otherwise john all that the father giueth me shall come to me and him that commeth to me j cast not away mat thou article peter and vpon this rocke will j builde my church and the gates of hell shall not preuaile against it john they went out from vs but they were not of vs for if they had beene of vs they would haue continued with vs rom we being then iustified we haue peace with god now how can this be true if he that is once iustified may fall from grace xiiii they affirme that workes doo of sufficient worthines merit eternall life here we must consider that if any worke be meritorious it must first be equiualent and proportionall to the iustice of god secondly god must receiue it vpon desert not vpon fauour now for our workes look to the holyest and they are verye imperfect and if so be they were in perfection answerable to the law yet were they no more then we are bound by duetye to perfourme and indeede nothing can merite ought at god handes but the woorkes of christ for the humanitie of christ giueth the matter of a meritorious worke and his deity whereunto his humanity is by an hypostaticall vnion vnited ministreth sufficient merit and worthines to the same worke this also may we adde that the doctrine of workes doth greatly darken the merit of christ because the obtaining of eternall life is detracted from christes death and obedience and attributed to workes for say these man christ by his passion deserued that man should be iustified but man being iustified deserued by his workes eternall life augustine hath a notable sentence against this their doctrine in his sermon de verbis apostoli if god saith he made vs man and we our selues made vs good man we haue made somewhat better then that which god hath made for a man that is saued is better then any man if therfore god made thee a man and thou didst make thy selfe a good man that which thou didst make is better then that which god made lift not thy self against god submit rather thy selfe and reuerence him xv they say that without especiall reuelation no man knoweth whether he be predestinate but it is out of all contrauersie that god by his spirite word and effects of predestination giueth certain testimonies to such as are his children that they are elect and shalbe saued corinthian we haue not received the spirit of the world but the spirit which is of god that we might know the things which are giuen vs of god luke reioyce that your names are written in the booke of life but no man can reioyce for any good which he assuredly knoweth not thus much shall suffice for the decree of election now followeth the decree of reprobation whereby god in his iust iudgement hath determined eternally to reiect some to the praise of his iustice pet being disobedient vnto the which thing they were ordained iude there are certain man crept in which were before of olde ordeined to this condemnation vngodly ampc thessa he hath not appointed vs to wrath but to obtaine saluation by our lord iesus christ rom what if god would to shew his wrath and to make his power known suffer with long patience the vessels of wrath prepared to destruction some fearing least they should make god an vniust and cruell god refer this worde predestination onelye to the elect as for the reprobate they hold that god doth not predestinate them but only foreknow that they should be condemned of this minde is heming syntag chap of predestination and iacobus andreas these man turne the causes of saluation and damnation vpside down following this order an vniuersall vocation wherby grace amp saluation is offred to al man without exception but this description halteth right down as may be proued by many reasons first it is vntrue that god would haue al man saued in christ for no man can be saide to be elected if god will that all man should be elected in christ for election is a singling out of some from others and he that electeth or chooseth cannot be said to receiue all neither can he that taketh all be saide to make choise of a few wherfore as all man agree that there is a decree of election so by the law of contraries we must conclude that there is in like order and place the decree of reprobation opposite vnto it if any man reason out of tim that god would that all man should be saued he must know that this sentence is not generallye ment of all man but indefinitely of some and therefore it must not be vnderstoode of euerye singular and particular man but of euery singular estate and condition of man revelation christ redeemed his by his blood out of euery kinred and tung and nation and people and he is said mat to haue cured euery disease that is euery kinde of disease and rom as by the offence of one the fault came on all man to condemnation so by the iustifying of one the benefite abounded toward al man to the iustification of life for as by one mans disobedience many were made sinners so by the obedience of one shall many also be made righteous in this place we must note that the words all man are indifinitelye put for many august in enchirid ad laurent c the scripture saith he that speaketh of god that he would haue all to be saued not as though there were none whom he would haue condemned seeing he would not shew his miracles to the who if he had shewed to them any they would as he himselfe saith haue repented but we must vnderstand by all man all sortes of man whether kinges or subiects or any other condition whatsoeuer ampc and in his booke de corrept amp gratia c it is said that he will haue all to be saued namely such as are predestinate to saluation because of all sorts of man some are predestinate as it is spoken of the pharasies ye ithe euery herb whereas peter saith pet god would haue no man to perish but all man to come to repentance this must be vnderstood of al the elect because he speaketh of such as are faithfull amp sanctified as for the place in ezek god will not the death of a sinner we must holde this that god will is not as it is the ouerthrowe and destruction of his creature yet may he be said to will it another way namely as death is a punishment and meanes to declare the iustice of god now in that john saith john that christ is a propitiation for the sinnes of the whole worlde his meaning is not that all the world shalbe saued but that the elect chosen out of all the world shal haue christ their propitiatour for so saith christ himselfe that he asketh not for the world but for the whom the father hath giuen him out of the world now it cannot be that he should be a propitiation for them for whom he doth not vouchsafe to pray secondly it is false that god will haue none damned for seeing that some man are condemned it must needes be either with his will or without his will if without his will then violence shalbe offred to the will of god something being doone against it which is impious once to thinke if with it god must needes change his minde which cannot be neither is there any cause why we should think that god is an accepter of persons if so be he ordaine any to condemnation because he was not moued hereunto by any inherent circumstance of any mans person neither oweth he ought to any man and may do with his own that which seemeth good vnto him neither must any thinke that hereby god hateth his creature for he decreede to destroye his workemanship not because he hated it but vpon iust causes known to him he ordeined it to be subiect to his hatred and god doth not actually hate any thing for ought but sinne that saying of aug to simpl is a true saying when god maketh the wicked whom he doth not iustifie vessels of wrath he dooth it not to hate that which he made for in that he made them vessels they haue their vse namely that by their paines to which they were ordeined the vessels of honour might reap profit god therfore doth not hate them in that they are man or vessels neither any thing that he made in them by creation or ordination for god hateth nothing which he hath made but in as much as he made them vessels of destruction he did it to instruct others as for their impietie which he neuer made that he hateth vtterlye as therefore a iudge hateth theft in a man but he dooth not hate his punishment that he is sent to worke in the mines for the theefe doth the first the judge the latter so god whereas of the company of them which perish he maketh vessels of perdition he dooth not therefore hate that which he doth that is the condemnation of those which perish in their due punishment for sinne if any oppose against this the place of mal that god is the father of all they must consider that it is to be vnderstoode of god church out of which all the corrupt posteritye of adam are the sonnes of wrath and children of satan ephesian ioh last of all this reason must not be vrged that god created any to the end he might destroye them for the ende of euerye mans creation is the glorye of god to the manifestation whereof the wicked were ordeined pro thirdly wheras they say that god did onelye foreknow and not from eternitie decree the fall of adam it is most impious for there is not the verie least thing in nature but it commeth to passe by god decree mat yes those actions which are sin the lord hath in his counsell determined of the act therfore if any be of this mind they either ouerturn god prouidence and counsel or at the least make it to be but a fond amp idle speculatio fourthly this is a preposterous doctrine namely that god did firste foreknow the fall of mankinde in adam and after that ordained such as he foreknew to death or life for the end is alwaies first in the intent of the agent again the fall of adam is a subordinate means wherby god doth execute the decree of predestination therefore no man may think that god first tooke counsell of the meanes wherby his decree might be accomplished and afterward considered of the thing to be accomplished that is of the decree of his election and reprobation last of all it is not true that all man are called to saluation and that therefore that grace which is in christ is offred to all and that god decreed to reiect some for their vnbeliefe which he foresawe in them for many children of faithfull parents haue died before they had any vse of reason at all ye many thousands of riper yeres which haue not had so much as a glimmering of christ act andalbeit a man should neuer contemne the gospell yet the corruption of originall sinne were enough to condemne the whole world againe that great admiration of paul rom o man who article thou which pleadest against god sheweth manifestly that the cause why god decreed to reiect some is vnsearchable and that it dooth not depend vpon his foresight that such would spurne against the grace offered them in the gospell aug hath a fit speech for this purpose epistle who saith he created the reprobate but god and why because it was his good pleasure but why was it his pleasure o man what article thou which disputest with god in the execution of this decree there is to be considered the foundation or beginning and the degrees or proceeding therof the foundation of executing the decree of reprobation is the fal of adam by which fal he was subiect both to sin amp danation ro for god hath shut vp al in vnbeliefe that he might haue mercye on all pet here we must note that god hath so decreed to condemne some as that notwithstanding all the fault and guilt of condemnation remaineth in the man only further whom god reiecteth to condemnation those he hateth this hatred of god is whereby he detesteth amp abhorreth the reprobate whe he is fallen into sin for the same sin and this hatred which god hath to man comes by the fal of adam and it is neither an antecedent or a cause of god decree but only a consequent and followeth the decree reprobates are either infants or man of riper age in reprobate infants the execution of god decree is this assoone as they are borne for the guilt of originall and naturall sinne being left in god secret iudgement vnto themselues they dying are reiected of god for euer rom but death reigned from adam to moses euen ouer them also that sinned not after the like maner of the transgression of adam which was the figure of him that was to come ro for yet the children were borne and when they had neither done good nor euill that the purpose of god might remaine according to election not by workes but by him that calleth reprobates of riper age are of sorts they that are called namelye by an vneffectuall calling and they that are not called in the reprobates which are called the execution of the decree of reprobation hath degrees to wit an acknowledgement of god calling a falling away againe and condemnation the acknowledgement of god calling is wherby the reprobates for a time doe subiect theselues to the calling of god which calling is wrought by the preaching of the word matth for many are called but few are chosen and of this calling there are fiue other degrees the first is an enlightning of their mindes wherby they are instructed of the holy ghost to the vnderstanding and knowledge of the worde heb for it is impossible that they which were once lightned ampc pet for if they after they haue escaped from the filthines of the world through the knowledge of the lord and of the sauiour iesus christ are yet tangled againe therin and ouercome the latter end is worse with them then the beginning the second is a certaine penitencie wherby the reprobate i doth know his sin ii is pricked with the feeling of god wrath for sin iii is greeued for the punishment of sin iiii doth confesse his sin v acknowledgeth god to be iust in punishing sin vi desireth to be saued vii promiseth repentance in his miserie or affliction in these words i will sin no more mat then when iudas which betraied him saw that he was condemned he repented himselfe and brought againe the thirtie peeces of siluer to the cheefe preests and elders heb for ye know how that afterward also when he would haue inherited the blessing he was reiected for he found no place to repentance though he sought the blessing with teares king now when ahab heard those wordes he rent his cloth and put sackcloth vpon him and fasted and laye in sackecloth and went softlye nomb let me dye the death of the righteous and let my last end be like his psalm for all this they sinned still and beleeued not his wonderous woorkes verse therfore their daies did he consume in vanitie and their yeeres hastily verse and when he slew them they sought him and they returned and sought god earlye ver they remembred that god was their strength and the most high god their redeemer the third degree is a temporarie faith wherby the reprobate doth confusedly beleeue the promises of god made in christ i saye confusedlye because he beleeueth that some shall be saued but he beleeueth not that he himselfe particularly shalbe saued because he being content with a generall faith doth neuer apply the promises of god to himselfe neither doth he so much as conceiue any purpose desire or endeauour to apply the same or any wrestling or striuing against securirie or carelesnes and distrust iam thou beleuest that there is one god thou doest well the devil also beleeue it and tremble matth and he that receiued seede in the stonye ground is he which heareth the woord and incontinentlye with ioy receiueth it yet hath he no roote in himselfe and dureth but a season ioh now when he was at jerusalem at the passeouer in the feast many beleeued in his name when they saw his miracles which he did v but iesus did not commit himselfe vnto them because he knew them all the fourth is a tasting of heauenly gifts as of iustification and of sanctification and of the vertues of the world to come this tasting is verilye a sence in the harts of the reprobates whereby they doe perceiue and feele the excellency of god benefits notwithstading they do not enioy the same for it is one thing to taste of dainties at a banquet amp another thing to feed amp to be nourished therby heb for it is impossible that they which were once lightned and haue tasted of the heauenlye gifte and were made partakers of the holy ghost the fift degree is the outward holynes of life for a time vnder which is comprehended the zeale in the profession of religion a reuerence and feare towards god ministers and amendment of life in many thinges mark for herod feared john knowing that he was a iust man and an holy and reuerenced him and when he heard him he did many thinges and heard him gladly actes then simon himselfe beleeued also and was baptized and continued with philip and wondred when he saw the signes and great miracles which were done hose o ephraim what shall i do vnto thee o iudah how shall i entreate thee for your goodnes is as a morning cloud and as the morning dew it goeth away the second degree of the execution of god counsell of reprobation in man of ripe age which are called is a falling away againe which for the most part is effected and wrought after this manner first the reprobate is deceiued by some sinne secondlye his hart is hardned by the same sinne thirdlye his hart being hardned it becommeth wicked and peruerse fourthly then followeth his incredulitie and vnbeliefe whereby he consenteth not to god word when he hath heard amp knowen it fiftly an apostacie or falling away from faith in christ dooth immediatlye followe this vnbeliefe heb take heede brother least at any time there be in any of you an euill hart and vnfaithfull to depart away from the liuing god tim this apostacie is sometimes sinne against the holye ghost which is when any man willinglye through obstinate malice dooth speake blasphemye against christ and his diuine truth which he hath certainly knowen this obstinacie of the hart ariseth from the olde and engraffed affections hatred enuye and malice directly against god himselfe and christ it hath his name not because it is committed against the person of the holy spirite but because it is done against the gift of the holye ghost namelye illumination this cannot be forgiuen because it excludeth all faith and repentance heb and chap ver for if we sinne willingly after that we haue receiued the trueth there remaineth no more sacrifice for sinnes after apostacie followeth pollutio which is the very fulnes of all iniquity altogither contrarye to sanctification gene and in the fourth generation they shall come hither againe for the wickednes of the amorites is not yet full the third degree is damnation wherby the reprobates are deliuered vp to eternall punishment the execution of damnation beginneth in death and is finished in the last iudgement luke and it was so that the begger died and was caried by the angell into abrahams bosome the rich man also died and was buried ver and being in hell tormentes he lift vp his eyes and saw abraham a farre off and lazarus in his bosome the execution of the degree of reprobation in infidel which are not called is this first they haue by nature ignorance and vanitie of minde after that followeth hardnes of hart whereby they become void of all sorow for their sinnes then commeth a reprobate sence which is when the naturall light of reason and of the iudgement of good and euill is extinguished afterward when the hart ceaseth to sorrow then ariseth a committing of sin with greedines then commeth pollution which is the fulnes of sinne lastlye a iust reward is giuen to all these to wit fearefull condemnation ephesian hauing their cogitation darkened and being strangers from the life of god through the ignorance that is in them because of the hardnes of their hartes rom for as they regarded not to know god euen so god deliuered them vp vnto a reprobate minde to doe those things which are not conuenient the death of the reprobate is a separation of the body and the soule of the bodie that for a time it may lie dead in the earth of the soule that it may feele the torments of hell euen vntill the time of the last iudgement at which time the whole man shall be cast into the most terrible and fearefull fire of hell pet by the which he also went and preached vnto the spirites that are in prison luke peter for if god spared not the angels that sinned but cast them downe into hell and deliuered them into chaines of darkenes to be kept vnto damnation the reprobates when they die doe become without sence and astonied like vnto a stone or else they are ouerwhelmed with a terrible horrour of conscience and despairing of their saluation as it were with the gulfe of the sea ouerturning them sam then in the morning when the wine was gone out of nabal his wife told him those wordes and his heart died within him and he was like a stone verse and about ten daies after the lorde smote nabal that he died math and when hee had cast downe the siluer peeces in the temple he departed and went and hanged himselfe in the last iudgement at the sound of the trumpet the liuing being stricken with horrour and feare shall be changed in a moment the dead shall rise againe to condemnation both the liuing and the dead shall then haue immortall body but without glorie and they standing vpon the earth at the left hand of christ the iudge shall heare the sentence of condemnation departe from mee yee curssed into euerlasting fire which is prepared for the deuill and his angels john and they shall come foorth that haue done good vnto the resurrection of life but they that haue doone euill vnto the resurrection of condemnation matth thess for the lorde himselfe shall descend from heauen with a showte and with the voyce of the archangell and with the trumpet of god and the dead in christ shall rise first verse then shall wee which liue and remaine bee caught vp with them also in the cloude to meete the lorde in the aire and so shall we be euer with the lorde after that the sentence of condemnation is pronounced then followeth euerlasting death whereof this is the estate i the reprobates are separated from the presence and glorie of god ii they are punished with eternall confusion and most bitter reproches because all their secret wickednesses and sinnes are reueiled thess which shalbe punished with euerlasting perdition from the presence of the lord and from the glorie of his power math blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see god ioh and now little children abide in him that when he shall appeare we may be bolde and not be ashamed before him at his comming iii they haue fellowship with the deuill and his angels mat iv they are wholy in body and soule tormented with an incredible horrour and exceeding great anguish through the sence and feeling of god wrath powred out vpon them for euer isay and they shall go foorth and looke vpon the carkaises of man that haue transgressed against me for their worme shall not die neither shall their fire be quenched and they shall be an abhorring vnto all flesh hereupon is the punishment of those that are condemned called hel fire a worme weeping and gnashing of teeth vtter darkenesse ampc revelation but the feareful amp vnbeleeuing amp the abominable amp murtherers amp whoremongers amp sorcerers amp idoloters and all liars shall haue their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone which is the second death math and shall cast them into a fornace of fire there shal be weeping amp gnashing of teeth isa and this is the full execution of god decree of reprobation whereby appeareth the great iustice of god in punishing sinne from whence also commeth god glorie which he propoundeth to himselfe as the last and cheefest end in all these thinges therefore let euery christian propound the same end vnto himselfe rom what shall we say then is there vnrighteousnesse with god god forbid verse for he said to moses i will haue mercy on him to whome i will shew mercie and will haue compassion on him on whom i will haue compassion verse so then it is not in him that willeth nor in him that runneth but in god that sheweth mercie verse for the scripture saith vnto pharaoh for this same purpose haue i stirred thee vp that i might shewe my power in thee and that my name might be declared throughout all the earth corinthian whether therefore ye eate or drinke or whatsoeuer ye doe doe all to the glorie of god the right applying of predestination to the persons of man is very necessarie and it hath two partes the first is the iudgement of particular predestination and the second is the vse of it the iudgement and discerning of a mans owne predestination is to be perfourmed by meanes of these rules which follow i the elect alone and all they that are elect not onely may be but also in god good time are sure of election in christ to eternal life corinthian cor ii they haue not this knowledge from the first causes of election but rather from the last effects thereof and they are especially two the testimonie of god spirite and the workes of sanctification pet rom iii if any doubt of this testimonie it will appeare vnto them whether it come from the spirite of god or their owne carnall presumption first by a full perswasion which they shall haue for the holy ghost will not barely say it but perswadeth such that they are the children of god the which the flesh cannot in any wise doe secondly by the manner of perswasion for the holy ghost draweth not reasons from the workes or worthinesse of man but from god fauour and loue and this kinde of perswasion is farre different from that kinde which satan vseth thirdly by the effects of that testimonie for if the perswasion arise from presumption it is a dead perswasion but contrarily it is most liuely and stirring if it come from the holy ghost for such as are perswaded that they are elected and adopted children of god they will loue god they will trust in him and they will call vpon him with their whole heart iv if the testimonie of god spirit be not so powerful in the elect then may they iudge of their electio by that other effect of the holy ghost namly sanctificatio like as we vse to iudge by heat that there is fire when we cannot see the flame it selfe v and of al the effects of sanctificatio these are most notable i to feele our wants amp in the bitternes of heart to bewaile the offence of god in euery sin ii to striue against the flesh that is to resist amp hate the vngodly motions thereof amp with griefe to thinke the burthenous amp troublesome iii to desire earnestly and vehemently the grace of god amp merit of christ to obtain eternall life iiii when it is obtained to accounte it a most precious iewell philipp v to loue the minister of god word in that he is a minister amp a christia in that he is a christian and for that cause if need require to be ready to sped our bloud with the mat ioh vi to cal vpon god earnestly amp with teares vii to desire amp loue christs comming and the day of iudgemet that an end may be made of the daies of sin viii to flie al occasions of sin and seriously to endeuour to come to newnes of life ix to perseuer in these things to the last gaspe of life luther hath a good sentence for this purpose he that will serue god must saith he beleeue that which cannot be seene hope for that which is deferred amp loue god whe he sheweth himselfe an enemie and thus remaine to the end now if so be al the effects of the spirit are very feeble in the godly they must know this that god trieth them yet so as they must not therewith be dismayed because it is most sure that if they haue faith but as much as a grane of mustard seed and as weake as a young infant is it is sufficient to ingraffe them into christ amp therfore we must not doubt of their election because they see their faith foeble amp the effects of the holy ghost faint within them vi neither must he that as yet hath not felt in his heart any of these effects presently conclude that hee is a reprobate but let him rather vse the word of god and the sacraments that he may haue an inward sense of the power of christ drawing him vnto him and an assurance of his redemption by christes death and passion vii no man may peremptorily set down that he or any other is a reprobate for god dooth oftentimes prefer those which did seeme to be most of all estraunged from his fauor to be in his kingdom aboue those who in mans iudgemet were the children of the kingdom hence is it that christ saith the publicanes and harlots goe before you and manie an one is called at the eleuenth houre as appeareth by that notable exaple of the theefe vpon the crosse the vses which may be made of this doctrine of predestination are very many first for our instruction we are taught these things i that there is neither any iustificatio by works nor any works of ours that are meritorious for election is by the free grace of god amp therefore in like sort is iustification for as i said before the cause of the cause is the cause of the thing caused and for this reason is the worke of saluation grace in the matter of saluation dooth challenge the whole worke to it selfe rom at this time there is a remnant through the election of grace tim who hath saued vs and called vs with an holy calling not according to our workes but according to his owne purpose and grace which was giuen to vs through christ iesus before the world was philipp vnto you it is giuen for christ that not onely yee should beleeue in him but also suffer for his sake rom we are iustified freely by grace tit not by the workes of righteousnesse which we had done but according to his mercie he saued vs ezech i will cause you to walke in my statutes roman the gift of god is eternall life ii that astrologie teaching by the casting of natiuities what man will be is ridiculous and impious because it determineth that such shalbe very like in life and conuersation whome god in his predestination hath made vnlike iaakob and esau borne of the same parents and almost in the same moment of time for iaakob held esau by the heele as he was borne were of most vnlike dispositions and had diverse euents the like may wee see in all twinnes and others which are borne at the same time iii that god is most wise omnipotent iust and mercifull o the wonderfull riches both of the wisedome and knowledge of god how vnsearchable are his iudgements and his waies past finding out ephesi who hath predestinate vs to bee adopted through iesus christ vnto himselfe according to the good pleasure of his will secondly beeing the servant of christ we are admonished i to fight against all doubting and diffidence of our saluation because it neither dependeth vpon workes nor faith but vpon god decree which is immutable math luke reioyce that your names are written in the booke of life rom who shall lay any thing to the charge of god chosen it is god that iustifieth who shall condemne tim this teacheth that the anker of hope must be fixed in the trueth and stabilitie of the immutable good pleasure of god so that albeit our faith be so tossed as that it is in danger of ship wracke neuerthelesse it must neuer sinke to the bottome but euen in the middes of daunger take holde vpon repentance as on a board and so recouer it selfe ii to hubmle our soules vnder the mightie hand of god for we are as clay in the hand of the potter rom they through infidelitie are broken off but thou standest through faith be not his minded but feare iii to giue all glorie to god thes wee ought to giue thankes alway to god for you brother beloued of the lord because that god hath from the beginning chosen you to saluation iiii to beare crosses patiently rom those which he knewe before he also predestinate to be made like to the image of his son this likenesse to christ is in bearing afflictions philipp that i may knowe him and the vertue of his resurrection and saued and by paul yee which are baptized haue put on christ dauid being armed with the like comfort from his circumcision feared not to ioyne battell with that great gyant goliah and if this were not so it must needes followe that baptisme were nothing else but an idle ceremonie and also the persons of the trinitie would bee thought lyers wherefore those afflicted man when satan assaulteth them must resist him with these wordes departe from mee sathan thou hast neither parte nor portion in the inheritance of my soule because i am baptized in the name of the holy trinitie and so am truely made the son of god by adoption and are these the strong weapons which so many times and in so many wordes haue beene obiected against me by d andreas and whereby hee hath gotten the victorie but because this his reason is somewhat intricate i will explane it after this sorte first for the place of scripture which he alledgeth namely that god is greater then our hearts it is so farre from comforting an afflicted conscience that it will rather driue him to despaire neither dooth ioh epistle make mention of it to ease such as are in despaire shewing vnto them by that sentence the greatnesse of god mercies but rather that he might thereby euen bruise in pieces the hearts of proud persons when they consider the greatnes of god maiestie and for the other place when as a man doubteth of his saluation and feeleth no testimonies of faith in himselfe for such an one we here speake of what comfort thinke you is baptized shalbe saued for he would rather reason contrarily thus i indeed am baptized yet for all that i beleeue not and therefore my baptisme is not auaileable i must needs be condemned for the saying of august in his treatise vpon ioh is very true who speaking of simon magus saith what good did it him to be baptized brag not therefore saith he that thou article baptized as though that were sufficient for thee to inherit the kingdom of heaue as for the place of paul gal i shewed plainely before how d andreas did violently wrest it to his purpose neither are his reasons taken from the absurditie that would follow of more force then the former albeit he maketh the especiall pillars to vnderprop the truth of his cause for i pray you is god of lesse trueth because his trueth is neglected amp derided of them that contemne it is the ceremonie of baptisme therfore in vaine because some refuse the grace offred in baptisme others if we may beleeue d andreas reiect that grace when they haue receiued it what is not the gospel therfore the power of god to saluation because it is to such as beleeue not the sauour of death to eternall death may not the supper of the lord be a pledge of god couenant because so many abuse these holy signes or as d andreas is of opinion the very body amp bloud of our sauiour christ and that i may reason fro that which is true in the experience of euery childe can the sun be said to be without light because they which are blind and asleepe haue no benefit by the light thereof neither such as shut their eyes so close that they will not enioy the cofort of the light but amongst all this one is most childish that d andr will make this his principal argument namely that in vaine did man thus tempted flie at all vnto baptisme vnlesse we conclude with him that all such as are baptized are in baptisme adopted the sonnes of god for first if this were a good consequet in baptisme it were in vaine for such an afflicted conscience to gather vnto himselfe a testimonie from the word of god amp the other sacrament of the lord supper vnlesse we make all those to be in like sort regenerate and adopted vnto whom the word of god is preached and the lordes supper administred either of which for d andreas to affirme is a bolde vntrueth but to omit this what if we graunt this which d andr requireth concerning baptisme may not for all that any that is so tempted by satans pollicie refel this great comforter by his own argument after this sort i wil graunt d andr your question suppose i haue been baptized amp adopted the son of god yet seeing you teach that the grace of god is not so sure but that i may fal fro the same as indeed i feele that i haue greeuously fallen what do ye now els but lift me vp with one hand to heauen amp with the other cast me downe into hel what meane you therefore to teach me those things which are so far from easing me as that contrarily they doe more and more lay out vnto me mine abominable amp vngratefull heart see nowe what sure consolation consciences greeuously afflicted may reape by this doctrine of their comforter d andreas now if any be desirous to know what spirituall comfort is most meet to be ministred vnto consciences so troubled i will shewe them that which is grounded vpo a sure foundation amp which i my self haue often found to be true in mine owne experience the which also i purpose to handle more largelie for the benefit of the christian reader first therfore we teach contrarily to that which d andreas doth most falsely obiect against vs that the eternall decree or as paul speketh the purpose of god must not be sought in the bottomlesse counsell of god but rather in the manifestation of it namely in his vocation by the word amp sacraments this i speake of such as are of yeeres of discretion as they must needs be whom we seeke to comfort in this place now because that externall vocation is not proper onely to the elect for many are called but few are chosen but such a vocation as is effectuall that is whereby the vnderstading is not onely enlightned with the sauing knowledge of god but in the will also there is created a true though not a perfect hatred of sinne from whence ariseth an abhorring of sinne and loue of that which is good or rather a desire to will and doe that which is right therefore when we see one thus dangerouslie tempted wee applie vnto his afflicted conscience that true nepenthes and comfortable amp restoratiue medicine which is taken from god effectuall vocation as it were out of an apothecaries boxe if therefore i haue to doe with such an one ed by the preaching of the gospell or if hee were called yet seemeth both to himselfe amp others neuer to haue regarded him that called and hence concludeth that hee is not in the nomber of them who god hath purposed to take pity vpon i forthwith tell him that satan plaieth the sophister in teaching him thus to conclude for this his reason is as vntrue as if a ma looking at midnight amp seeing that the sun is not then risen should therfore affirme that it would neuer rise and this is that which when i obiected to d andreas pag he very boldly corrupting my meaning printed this as mine assertion say vnto a man that is afflicted the sun is risen although as yet it be not rise but i teach not lies howsoeuer this deprauation of my words came fro d andr printers or himselfe and whereas d andr excepted that this consolation were to no purpose because he that was afflicted might doubt whether this sun would euer rise or not i answered to him that which the printers haue quite left out and which i will now therefore more fully repeate i was wont therefore to tell the party thus troubled after he had forsaken his false and deuelish position that although an externall vocation were not of force enough to appease an afflicted conscience yet it was of sufficient force and efficacie against the deuill for i tell him that they which neuer had external nor internal calling they if we regard an ordinary caling must needs perish but whosoeuer is once called he hath set as it were his foot in the first entry into the kingdo of heauen and vnlesse it be by his owne default he shall come afterward into the courtes of god and so by degrees into his maiesties pallace and for the confirmation of this i vse diverse waies for why say i doubtest thou of his good will towards thee who in mercy hath sent me a minister to call thee vnto him thou hast no cause vnlesse thou alledge the number of thy sinnes if this be all why oppose the infinite greatnes of god mercy against thy sinnes who hath sent me to bring thee vnto him the lord vouchsafeth to bring thee into the way of the elect why article thou a stumbling block vnto thy self and refusest to followe him if thou feelest not as yet inwardly in thy selfe to be stirred forward pray that thou maiest be know this for a most sure trueth that this desire in thee is a pledge of god fatherlye good will towards thee he neither can nor will be wanting to this which he hath stirred vp in thee after these exhortations i shew him how some are called at the eleuenth houre how the gentiles after many thousand yeeres were called to be god people how the theefe was saued vpon the crosse these and many other remedies i vsed whereof i neuer remember that i repented me but if i deale with such as haue before obeyed the lord calling and either by reason of some greuous sinne into which they haue fallen or because they haue absented themselues from the church of god or in that they refusing publike and priuate admonitions haue bene offenciue to the church or which in mine experience hath befallen many very good and godly persons whilest they satisfie not themselues they are so altogither busilie conuersant in reprehending and iudging themselues that they for a while forget the mercy of god with these to omit such as for some naturall infirmities are if they procure not speedie helpe of some expert minister most daungerouslye tempted with these i say i vse this order first i desired that they intimate vnto me that which especiallye greeueth them and as i vnderstand both the thing and measure therof by them i take especiall care of this that they being already ouermuch cast down that i then by the seuere denunciation of the lawe doe not quite ouerturne them yet so as that i doe not altogither withdraw them either from condemning their former sins or the meditation of god iudgement and so as much as i can i temper the words of consolation as that i nothing cloake god anger against them for their sinnes after i haue thus prepared the i then demaund whether they haue bene euer in this case or no nay say they for the most part the time was whe i was in great ioy and peace of conscience i serued the lord the was i an vnhappie person ful of faith full of hope but now wretch that i am i haue lost my first loue and there is nothing vexeth me more then to remember those times past but say i whether consideration is more greeuous vnto thee the apprehension of god iudgments or the dislike of thy selfe that thou shouldest offend so gratious and so louing a father both say they but especially the latter therfore say i sinne also displeaseth thee in that it is sin namely because it is evil and god who is goodnes it selfe is offended with it it is euen as you haue told vs say they and i am now ashamed that so vile and wicked a wretch as my selfe should come before so gratious amp merciful a father then i tell them that no man is offended but rather is glad when he can iniury one whom he hateth this they graunt and withal say god forbid that albeit the lord hate me i in like sort should hate him vnto whom if it were possible i would be reconciled again then i ad this be of good comfort my deer brother you are in good case for who can loue god especially whe he was wounded by him who can bewaile the losse of his freendship who can desire to come againe into his fauour but he whome god still loueth although for a time he be angry with him except peraduenture you haue not learned thus much that the knowledge of our saluation commeth not from fleshe and bloud but from god himselfe who first vouchsafeth to instruct vs and from christ iesus manifesting the father vnto vs and that is god blessing that we do loue god who loued vs first when we were his enemy you haue therfor my good brother iust cause why you should be greatly displesed with many things past but ther is no cause why you should despair briefly you haue inwardly amp as it were dwelling with you euidet testimonies of your reconciliatio with god especially if you cease not to pray vnto him earnestly who hath laid the foundation of repentance in you to wit a dislike of sinne and a desire to be reconciled vnto him the sheepe which wandred out of the folde ceased not to be a sheepe albeit it went a straye for a time you now are that sheepe to whome that faithfull shepheard of all those sheep which the father hath committed to him leauing those ninetie and nine doth not so much by our ministerye declare that he seeketh you as hauing already sought you though you not seeking him hath indeede found you knocke saith he and it shalbe opened vnto you and haue you now forgotten those promises which were so often made to them that repent and also which they had experience of who in the sight of the worlde were in a desperate case but i saith he againe feele no motions of the comforter i haue now no sence of faith or hope but i feele all the contrarie nay say i you deceiue your selfe as i tolde you before for it is the comforter alone which teacheth you to hate sinne not so much for the punishment as because it is euill and disliketh god albeit he shew not himselfe so fully at the first because you had so manye waies greeuously offended him as that he seemeth for a while quite to forsake you and that you haue not qutte lost him but that he is as yet in some secret corner of your soule from whence at your instant praiers he will shew himselfe vnto you this will plainely declare vnto you which i now admonish you of the second time but let vs graunt as much as you say yet sure it is that your faith was not dead but onely possessed with a spirituall lyturgie you liued in the wombe of your mother and there were ignorant of your life a drunken man although he lose for a time the vse of reason and also of his limmes yet he neuer looseth reason it selfe you would think that in winter the trees were dead but they spring againe in the summer season at night the sun setteth but in the next morning it riseth againe and how often see we by experience that he which at one time took the foile in a combate at another did win the price and know this that in the spirituall combate of the flesh with the spirit the like we may see in manye partlye by reason of the weakenes of our nature partlye through sloth to resist and partlye for default to beware to these he replyeth for such temptations are hardly remoued i would to god saith he i could perswade my selfe that these promises belonged to me for my present estate constraineth me to doubt whether i am the childe of god or no

this text containeth one of the iudiciall lawes of moses touching the punishment of witchcraft which argument i haue chosen to intreat of for these causes first because witchcraft is arife and common sinne in these our daies and very many are intangled with it beeing either practitioners thereof in their owne persons or at the least yeilding to seeke for helpe and counsell of such as practise it againe there be sundrie man who receiue it for a truth that witchcraft is nothing else but a meere illusion and witches nothing but persons deluded by the deuill and this opinion takes place not onely with the ignorant but is holden and maintained by such as are learned who doe auouch it by word and writing that there be no witches but as i said before vpon these and such like considerations i haue beene mooued to vndertake the interpretation of this iudiciall law as a sufficient ground of the doctrine which shall be deliuered in handling whereof two things are distinctly to be considered the first what is a witch the second what is her due and deserued punishment and both these beeing opened and handled the whole meaning of the law will the better appeare for the first to giue the true descriptio of a witch is a matter of great difficultie because there be many differences and diuersities of opinions touching this point and therefore that we may properly and truly define a witch we must first pause a while in opening the nature of witchcraft so farre forth as it is deliuered in the bookes of the old and new testament and may be gathered out of the true experience of learned and godly man touching witchcraft therefore i will consider three points i what witchcraft is ii what is the ground of the whole practise thereof iii how many kinds and differences there be of it to begin with the first according to the true meaning of all the places of holy scripture which treate of this point it may be thus described witchcraft is a wicked arte seruing for the working of wonders by the assistance of the deuill so farre forth as god shall in iustice permit i say it is an arte because it is commonly so called and esteemed amongst man and there is reason why it should be thus tearmed for as in all good and lawful arts the whole practise thereof is performed by certaine rules and precepts and without them nothing can be done so witchcraft hath certaine superstitious grounds and principles whereupon it standeth and by which alone the seats and practises thereof are commonly performed if it be demaunded what these rules be and whence they had their beginning considering that euery arte hath reference to some author by whom it was originally taught and deliuered i answer that they weare deuised first by satan and by him reuealed to wicked and vngodly persons of auncient times as occasion serued who receiuing them from him became afterward in the iust iudgement of god his instruments to report and conuey them to others from hand to hand for manifestation whereof it is to be considered that god is not onely in generall a soueraigne lord and king ouer all his creatures whether in heauen or earth none excepted no not the deuills themselues but that he exerciseth also a speciall kingdome partly of grace in the church militant vpon earth and partly of glorie ouer the saints and angels members of the church triumphant in heauen now in like manner the deuill hath a kingdome called in scripture the kingdom of darknes whereof himselfe is the head and gouernour for which cause he is tearmed the prince of darknes corinthian the god of this world ruling and effectually working in the hearts of the children of disobedience againe as god hath enacted laws whereby his kingdome is gouerned so hath the deuill his ordinances whereby he keepeth his subiects in awe and obedience which generally and for substance are nothing else but transgressions of the very lawe of god and amongst the all the precepts of witchcraft are the very chiefe and most notorious for by them especially he holds vp his kingdome and therefore more esteemeth the obedience of them then of other neither doth he deliuer them indifferently to euery man but to his owne subiects the wicked and not to them all but to some speciall and tried ones whome he most betrusteth with his secrets as beeing the fittest to serue his turne both in respect of their willingnesse to learne and practise as also for their abilitie to become instruments of the mischiefe which he intendeth to others if it be here asked whence the deuill did fetch and conceiue his rules i answer out of the corruption and deprauation of that great measure of knowledge he once had of god and of all the duties of his seruice for that beeing quite depraued by his fall he turnes the same to the inuenting and deuising of what he is possibly able against god and his honour hereupon well perceiuing that god hath expressely commanded to renounce and abhorre all practises of whitchcraft he hath set abroach this article in the world as a maine pillar of his kingdome which notwithstanding is flatly and directly opposed to one of the maine principall lawes of the kingdome of god touching the seruice of himselfe in spirit and truth againe the reason why he conueies these vngodly principles and practises from man to man is because he finds in experience that things are farre more welcome and agreeable to the common nature of mankinde which are taught by man like vnto themselues then if the deuill should personally deliuer the same to each man in speciall hereupon he takes the course at first to instruct some fewe onely who beeing taught by him are apt to conuey that which they know to others and hence in probabilitie this deuillish trade had his first originall and continuance in the second place i call it a wicked article o distinguish it from all good and lawful a s taught in schooles of learnin which they are war antable by the word of god so are they no lesse profitable and necessary in the church againe to shewe the nature and quali ie of that it is a most vngracious and wicked article as appear th by the scriptures for when saul had broken the expresse commandement of god in sparing agag and the best things samuel tells him th t rebellion and disobedience is as the sinne of witchcraft that is a most horrible and like vnto that wicked capitall and sinne sam thirdly i dde te ing to the working or producing of wonders wherein is noted the pro er ende of this article whereby i put a further difference betweene it and others that are godly and lawful now if question be mooued why man should desire witchcraft to worke wonders the true and proper cause is first temptation whereby the deuill preuailed against our first parents had inclosed within it many sinnes for the eating of the forbidden fruit was no small or single offence but as some haue taught contained in it the breach of euery commandement of the morall lawe amongst the rest satan laboured to bring them to the sinne of discontentment whereby they sought to become as god that is better then god had made them not resting content with the condition of man his sinne was then learned and could neuer since b forgotten but continually is deriued from them to al their poster ie and now is become so common a corruption in the whole nature of flesh and blood that there is scarce a man to be found vvho is not originally tainted therevvith as he is a man this corruption shevves it selfe principally in tvvo things both vvhich are the maine causes of the practises of witchcraft first in mans outwardest e for lie beeing naturally possessed with a loue of himselfe and an high conceit of his owne deseruing when he liues in base and low estate whether in regard of pouertie or want of honour and reputation which he thinkes by right is due vnto him he then growes to some measure of griefe and sorrow within himselfe hereupon he is mooued to yeeld himselfe to the deuill to be his vassall and scholler in this wicked article supposing that by the working of some wonders he may be able in time to releeue his pouerty and to purchase to himselfe credit and countenance amongst man it were easie to shew the truth of this by examples of some persons who by these meanes haue risen from nothing to great places and preferments in the world in stead of all it appeareth in certain popes of rome as syluester the second benedict the eight alexander the sixt john the and twentie one ampc who for the attayning of the popedom as history record gaue theselues to the devil in the practise of witchcraft that by the working of wonders they might rise fro one step of honour to another vntill they had seated themselues in the chaire of the papacie so great was their desire of eminencie in the church that it caused them to dislike meaner conditions of life and neuer to cease aspiring though they incurred thereby the hazard of good conscience and the losse of their soules the scond degree of discontentment is in the minde and inward man and that is curiositie when a man resteth not satisfied with the measure of inward gifts receiued as of knowledge wit vnderstanding memorie and such like but aspires to search out such things as god would haue kept secret and hence he is mooued to attempt the cursed article of magicke and witchcraft as a way to get further knowledge in matters secret and not reueiled that by working of wonders he may purchase fame in the world and consequently reape more benefit by such unlawful courses then in likelihood he could haue done by ordinarie and lawful meanes fourthly it is affirmed in the description that witchcraft is practised by the assistance of the deuill yet the more fully to distinguish it from all good lawful and commendable arts for in them experience teacheth that the arts master is able by himselfe to practise his article amp to doe things belonging thereunto without the help of another but in this it is otherwise for here the worke is done by the helpe of another namely the deuill who is confederate with the witch the power of effecting such strange works is not in the article neither doth it flow from the skill of the sorcerer man or woman but is deriued wholly from satan and is brought into execution by vertue of mutuall consederacie betweene him and the magician now that this part of the description may be more clearely manifested procede to a further point kind of wonders they be which are ordinarily wrought by the ministerie and power of the deuill wonders therefore be of two sorts either true and plaine or lying and deceitfull a true wonder is a rare worke done by the power of god simply either aboue or against the power of nature and it is properly called a miracle the scripture is plentifull in examples of this kind of this sort was the deuiding of the redde sea and making it drie land by a mighty east wind that the children of israel might passe through it exod for though the east wind be naturall of great force to mooue the water and to drie the earth yet to part the sea asunder and to make the water to stand as walls on each side and the bottome of the sea as a pauement this is a worke simply aboue the naturall power of any wind and therefore is a miracle again such were the wonders done by moses and aaron before pharaoh in egypt one whereof in stead of many was the turning of aarons rodde into a serpent a worke truely miraculous for it is aboue the power of naturall generation that the substance of on creature should be really turned into the substance of another as the substance of a roode into the substance of a serpent of the like kinde were the standing of the sun in the firmament without moouing in his course for a whole day losh the going backe of the sun in the firmament tenne degrees king the preseruation of the three man shadrach meshach and abednego in the midst of the hoat fierie fornace daniel and of daniel in the lyons den daniel the feeding of fiue thousand man beside woman and children with fiue loaues and two fish matth the curing of the eyes of the bling man with spittle and clay tempered together ioh ampc now the effecting of a miracle in this kind is a work proper to god onely and no creature man or angel can doe any thing either aboue or contrarie to nature but he alone which is the creator for as god in the beginning made all things of nothing so he hath reserued to himselfe as a peculiar work of his almightie power to change or abolish the substance propertie motion and vse of any creature the reason is because he is the author and creator of nature and therefore at his pleasure is perfectly able to command restraine enlarge or extend the power amp stregth thereof without the helpe or assistance of the creature againe the working of a miracle is a kind of creation for therein a thing is made to be which was not before and this must needs be proper to god alon by whose power things that are were once produced out of things that did not appeare the conclusion therefore must needs be this which dauid confesseth in the psalme god onely doth wondrous things psalme that is works simply wonderfull but it is alleadged to the contrarie that the prophets in the old testament and the apostles in the new did worke miracles i answer they did so but how not by their owne power but by the power of god beeing onely his instruments whom he vsed for some speciall purpose in those works and such as did not themselues cause the miracle but god in and by them the same doth peter and john acknowledge when they had restored the lame man to the perfect vse of his limmes that by their power and godlinesse they had not made the man to goe act againe it is obiected that our sauiour christ in his manhood wrought many miracles as those before mentioned and many more ans christ as he was man did something in the working of miracles but not all for in euery miraculous worke there be two things the worke it sel e and the acting or dispensing of the work the work it selfe being for nature and substance miraculous considering it was aboue or against the order of natural causes did not proceed rom christ as man but from him as god but the dispensation of the same in this or that visible manner to the viewe of man was done and performed by his manhood for example the raising vp of lazarus out of the graue hauing beene dead foure daies was a miracle to the effecting whereof both the godhead amp the manhood of christ ocurred by their seueral amp distinct actios the manhood onely vttered the voice and bad lazarus come forth but it was the godhead of christ that fetched his soule from heauen and put it againe into his bodie yes which gaue life and power to lazarus to heare the voice vttered to rise and come forth ioh in like manner when he gaue sight to the blinde matth he touched their eyes with the hands of his manhood but the power of opening them and making them to see came from his godhead whereby he was able to doe all things and in all other miraculous workes which he did the miracle was alwaies wrought by his diuine power onely the outward actions and circumstances that accompanied the same proceeded from him as he was man now if christ as he is man cannot worke a true miracle then no meere creature can doe it no not the angels themselues and consequently not satan it beeing a meere supernaturall worke performed onely by the omnipotent power of god the second sort of wonders are lying and deceitfull which also are extraordinarie workes in regard of man because they proceed not from the vsuall and ordinarie course of nature and yet they be no miracles because they are done by the vertue of nature and not aboue or against nature simply but aboue and against the ordinarie course thereof and these are properly such wonders as are done by satan and his instruments examples whereof wee shall see afterwards if any man in reason thinke it not likely that a creature should be able to worke extraordinarily by naturall means he must remember that though god hath reserued to himselfe alone the power of abolishing and changing nature the order whereof he set and established in the creation yet the alteration of the ordinarie course of nature he hath put in the power of his strongest creatures angels and deuills that the angels haue receiued this power and doe execute the same vpon his command or permission it is manifest by scripture and the proofe of it is not so necessarie in this place but that satan is able to doe extraordinarie workes by the helpe of nature which is the question in hand it shall appeare if we consider in him these things first the devil is by nature a spirit amp therfore of great vnderstanding knowledge amp capacitie in all naturall things of what sort qualitie amp codition soeuer whether they be causes or effects whether of a simple or mixt nature by reason whereof he can search more deeply amp narrowly into the grounds of things then all corporall creatures that are clothed with flesh and blood secondly he is an auncient spirit whose skil hath beene confirmed by experience of the course of nature for the space almost of sixe thousand yeares hence he hath attainted to the knowledge of many secrets and by long obseruation of the effects is able to discern and iudge of hidden causes in nature which man in likelyhood cannot come vnto by ordinarie meanes for want of that opportunitie both of vnderstading and experience hereupon it is that whereas in nature there be some properties causes and effects which man neuer imagined to be others that man did once know but are now forgot some which man knewe not but might know and thousands which can hardly or not at all be known all these are most familiar vnto him because in themselus they be no wonders but only misteries and secrets the vertue and effect whereof he hath sometime obserued since his creation thirdly he is a spirit of wonderfull power and might able to shake the earth and to confound the creatures inferiour to him in nature and condition if he were not restrained by the omnipotent power of god and this power as it was great by his creation so it is not impayred by his fall but rather increased and made more forcible by his irreconciliable malice he beareth to mankind specially the seede of the woman fourthly there is in the devil an admirable quicknes and agilitie proceeding from his spirituall nature whereby he can very speedily and in a short spoce of time conuay himselfe and other creatures into places farre distant one from another by these ower helpes satan is inabled to doe strange workes strange i say to man whose knowledge since the fall is mingled with much ignorance euen in naturall things whose experience is of short continuance and much hindered by forgetfulnes whose agilitie by reason of his grosse nature is nothing if he had not the helpe of other creatures whose power is but weaknes and infirmity in comparison of satans if their be any further doubt how satan can by these helpes worke wonders we may be resolued of the truth thereof by considering three other things first that by reason of his great knowledge and skill in nature he is able to apply creature to creature and the causes efficient to the matter and therby bring things to passe that are in common conceit impossible secondly he hath power to mooue them not onely according to the ordinary course but with much more speed and celeritie thirdly as he can apply and mooue so by his spirituall nature he is able if god permit to conuey himselfe into the substance of the creature without any penetration of dimensions and beeing in the creature although it be neuer so solide he can worke therein not onely according to the principles of the nature thereof but as farre as the strength and abilitie of those principles will possibly reach and extend themselues thus it appeareth that the deuill can in generall worke wonders now more particularly the deuills wonders are of two sorts illusions or reall actions an illusion is a worke of satan wherby he deludeth or deceiueth man and it is two fold either of the outward senses or of the minde an illusion of the outward senses is a worke of the devil wherby he makes a man to thinke that he heareth seeth feeleth or toucheth such things as indeede he doth not this the deuill can easily doe diverse waies euen by the strength of nature for example by corrupting the instruments of sense as the humor of the eye ampc or by altering and changing the ayre which is the meanes whereby we see and such like experience teacheth vs that the deuill is a skilfull practitioner in this kind though the means whereby he worketh such feats be vnknowne vnto vs in this manner paul affirmeth that the galatians were deluded whe he saith o foolish g latians who hath bewitched you gal where he vseth a word borrowed from the practise of witches and sorcerers who vse to cast a miste as it were before the eyes to dazle them and make things to appeare vnto them which indeede they doe not see and the ground of pauls comparison is that which hee takes for a graunted truth that there be such delusions whereby mens senses are and may be corrupted by satanicall operation thus againe the deuill by the witch of endor deceiued saul in the appearance of samuel sam making him beleeue that it had beene samuel indeed whereas it was but a mere coun erfeit of him as shal appeare hereafter againe the deuill knowing the constitutions of man and the particular diseases whereunto they are inclined taks the vantage of some and secondeth the nature of the disease by the cocurrence of his owne delusion thereby corrupting the imagination and working in the minde a strong perswasion that they are become that which in truth they are not this is apparant in that disease which is tearmed lycanthropia where some hauing their brains possessed and distempered with melancholy haue verily thought themselues to bee wolues and so behaued themselues and the history of man in former ages haue recorded strange testimonies of some that haue been thus turned into wolues lyons dogges birds and other creatures which could not be really in substance but onely in appearance and phantasie corrupted and so these records are true for god in his iust iudgement may suffer some man so to be bewitched by the deuill that to their conceit th y may seeme to be like these bruit beaste though indeede they remaine true still for it i a worke surmounting the deuills power to change the substance of any one creature into the substance of another by this kind of delusion the church of rome in the times of blindnesse and ignorance hath taken great aduantage and much encreased her riches and honour for there be three points of the religion of that church to wi e rurgatorie inuocation of saints and honouring of reliques whereby she hath notably inriched her selfe all which had their first foundation from these and such like satanicall impostures for the onely way whereby they haue brought the common sort to yeeld vnto them both for beleefe and practise hath beene by deluding their outward sense with false apparitions of ghosts and soules of man walking and ranging abroad after their departure and such like wherby simple persons ignorant of their fetches and delusions haue beene much affrighted a d caused thorough extremitie of feare and dread to purchase their owne peace and securitie by many and great expenses and indeede these were the strongest arguments that euer they had and which most preuailed with the common people as is manifest in stories of all nation and ages where such deceits haue taken place though oftentimes by the iust iudgement of god they were taken in their craft and their feat reuealed the second kind of illusion is of the minde whereby the deuill deceiues the minde and makes a man thinke that of himselfe which is not true thus experience teacheth that he hath deluded man both in former and latter times who haue auouched and professed themselues to be kings or the sonnes of kings yes some haue holden themselues to be christ some to be elijah some to be john the baptist and some extraordinarie prophets and the like concei s haue entred into the minds of sundrie witches by the suggestion and perswasion of the deuill to whome when they haue wholly resigned their soules and body they haue beene mooued to beleeue things impossible touching themselues as that they haue indeed beene changed into other creatures as catts birds mise ampc the inquisitions of spaine amp other country wherein these and such like things are recorded touching witches really metamorphosed into such creatures cannot be true considering that it is not in the power of the deuill thus to change substaces into other substaces and those conuersions recorded by them were onely satans illusions wherewith the mindes of witches were possessed and nothing else which though they were extraordinarie as the rest of this kinde are yet they went not beyond the power of nature the second sort of the deuills wonders are reall workes that is such as are indeede that which they seeme and appeare to be these howsoeuer to man that knowe not the natures of things nor the secret and hidden causes thereof they may seeme very strange and admirable yet they are no true miracles because they are not aboue and beyond the power of nature if it be here alleadged that the devil workes are not reall and true actions because the holy ghost calleth them lying wonders thes i answer that they are called lying wonders not in respect of the workes themselues for they were workes truely done and effected but in regard of the deuills end and purpose in working the which is to lie vnto man and by them to deceiue the truth of which point will appeare in the viewe of some particular examples first we read in the historie of iob that satan brought downe fire from heauen which burnt vp iobs sheep and servant and caused a mightie winde to blowe downe the house vpon his children as they were feasting to destroy them againe he smot the bodie of iob with botches and boyles all these were true amp reall works very strange amp admirable and yet no miracles because they exceeded not the compasse of nature for first when he cast downe the fire from heauen he did not create the fire of nothing for that is a worke proper to god alone but applied creature to creature and therefore produced such a matter as was fit to make fire of if it be demanded how he is able to doe this we must remember that his knowledge in naturall causes is great and therefore he was not ignorant of the materiall cause of fire which beeing throughly knowne and founde out satan brought fire vnto it and so putting fire to the matter of fire he brought it downe by his power and agilitie from heauen vpon the cattell and servant of iob againe the winde which blewe downe the house where his sonnes and daughters were eating and drink was not created by the deuill but he knowing well the matter wherof winds are generated naturally added matter to matter and thence came the winde whereunto he ioynes himselfe beeing a spirit of a swift and speedie nature and so makes it for his own purpose the more violent and forcible thirdly he smote iobs bodie with sore boyles from the crowne of his head to the sole of his foote now this may seeme strange that he should haue such power ouer mans body as to cause such diseases to breed in it therefore we are further to vnderstand that his knowledge extendeth it selfe to the whole frame and disposition of mans bodie whereby it comes to passe that the causes of all diseases are well knowne vnto him and he is not ignorant ho e the humour in the bodie may be putrified and what corrupt humour will breede such and such diseases and by what meanes the aire it selfe may be infected hereupon preparing his matter and applying cause to cause he practised vpon the bodie of iob and filled him with grieuous sores another example of satans reall workes is this by reason of his great power and skill he is able to appeare in the forme and shape of a man and resemble any person or creature and that not by deluding the senses but by assuming to himselfe a true body his power is not so large as to create a bodie or bring againe a oule into a bodie yet by his dexteritie and skill in naturall causes he can worke wonderfully for he is able hauing gathered together fit matter to ioyne member to member and to make a true bodie either after the likenes of man or some other creature and hauing so done to enter into it to mooue and stirre it vp and downe and therein visibly and sensibly to appeare vnto man which though it be a strange worke and besides the ordinarie course of nature yet it is not simply aboue the power thereof for a third instance the deuill is able to vtter a voice in plaine words and speach answerable to mans vnderstanding in any language not that he can take vnto himselfe beeing a spirit an immeadiate power to speake or frame a voyce of nothing without meanes but knowing the naturall and proper causes and meanes by which man doe speake by them he frames in himselfe the voyce of a man and plainely vtters the same in a knowne language in this manner he abused the tongue and mouth of the serpent when in plaine words he tempted eue to eate the forbidden fruit now it is to be remembred here that when the deuill speakes in a creature it must be such a creature as hath the instruments of speach or such whereby speach may be framed and vttered not otherwise for it was neuer heard that he spake in a stocke or a stone or any created entity that had not the meanes and power of vttering a voice at least in some sort it beeing a worke peculiar to the creator to giue power of vtterance where it is not by creation againe when he frameth a voice in a creature he doth it not by giuing immediate power to speake for that he cannot doe and the creature abused by him remaineth in that regard as it was before but it beeing naturally fitted and disposed to vtter a voice though not perfectly to speake as a man he furthereth and helpeth nature in it and addeth to the facultie thereof a present vse of words by ordering and ruling the instruments to his intended purposes and to conclude this point looke what strange workes and wonders may be truely effected by the power of nature though they be not ordinarily brought to passe in the course of nature those the deuill can do amp so farre forth as the power of nature will permit he is able to worke true wonders though for a false and euill ende here a question is mooued by some whether the devil can change one creature into another as a man or woman into a beast for some notwithstanding the doctrine alreadie taught are of opinion that he can turne the body of witches into other creatures as hares cattes and such like ans the transmuta ion of the substance of one creature into another as of a man into a beast of what kind soeuer is a worke simply aboue the power of nature and therefore cannot be done by the devil or any creature for it is the proper worke of god alone as i haue said to create to change or abolish nature it is obiected that such chages haue beene made for lots wi e was turned into a pillar of salt gen ans it is true but that was done by the mightie power of god neither can it be proued that any creature angel or other was euer able to doe the like but it is further said that king nabuchadnezzar was turned in o a beast and did eate grasse with the beast of the field daniel ans there is no such matter his substance was not changed so as his bodie became the bodie of a beast indeede but his condicions onely were altered by the iudgement of god vpon his minde whereby he was so farre forth bereaued of humane sense and vnderstanding againe for his behauiour and kinde of life he became altogether bruitish for the time and excepting onely his outward forme and shape no part of humanitie could appeare in him but that he retained his humane bodie still it is euident by his owne words verse when he saith and mine vnderstanding was restored to me which argueth plainly that the hand of god was vpon him in some kind of madnesse and furie and therefore that there was not a change of his bodie and substance but a strange and fearefull alteration in his minde and outward behauiour and though such a transmutation should be granted yet it makes nothing for the purpose considering it was the worke of god onely and not of the deull and thus we see what kind of wonders the devil can bring to passe the meditation of which point may teach vs tvvo things first that the working of wonders is not a thing that will commend man vnto god for the deuill himselfe a wicked spirit can worke them and many shall alledge this in the day of iudgement that they haue by the name of god cast out devil and done many great wo ks to whome notwithstanding the lord will say i neuer knewe you depart from me yee workers of in quitie matth it behooueth vs rather to get vnto our selues the precious gifts of faith repentance and the feare of god yes to go before others in a godly life and vpright conuers tion then to excell in effecting of strange workes when the seauentie disciples came to our sauiour christ with ioy and tolde him that euen the deuills were subdued vnto them through his name luke he counsells them not to reioyce in this that wicked spirits were s bdued vnto them but rather because their names were written in heauen verse indeed to be able to worke a wonder is an excellent gift of god and may minister matter of reioycing when it proceedeth from god but seeing the deuill receiued this power by the gift of creation our speciall ioy must not be therein but rather in this that we are the adopted sonnes of god in which priuiledge the deuill hath no part with vs and therefore the apostle corinthian making a comparison of the gifts of the spirit as of speaking diverse tongues of prophecying and working miracles with loue in the end wisheth man to labour for the best gifts which are faith hope and loue because by these we are made partakers of christ on whom we ought to set our hearts and in whome we are commanded lwaies to reioyce philipp secondly we learne from hence not to beleeue or receiue a doctrine now or at any time because it is confirmed by wonders for the deuill himselfe is able to confirme his errours and idolatrous seruices by strange and extraordinarie signes by which vsually he laboureth to auouch and verisie the grossest points of falshood in matter of religion on the contrarie we must not reiect or contemne a doctrine because it is not thus confirmed this was a maine fault in the iewes who would not receiue the word preached by christ vnlesse he shewed them a signe from heauen indeed in the primitiue church it pleased god to confirme that doctrine which the apostles taught by great signes and miracles but now that gift is ceased and the church hath no warrant to expect any further euidence of the religion it professeth and enioyeth by arguments of that kinde yes rather it hath cause to suspect a doctrine taught for the wonders sake whereby man labour to auouch it the last clause in the description is this so farre forth as god in iustice suffereth which i adde for two causes first o shew that god for iust causes permi te h the arts of magicke amp witchcraft and the practises thereof now this he doth in his prouidence either for the triall of his children or for the punishment of the wicked first therefore god permits these wicked arts in the church to prooue whether his children wil steadfastly beleeue in him and seeke vnto his word or cleaue vnto the deuill by seeking to his wicked instruments this moses plainely forewarned the church of god of in his time deuter v if there arise among you a prophet or a dreamer of dreames and giue thee a signe or wonder v and the signe and wonder which he hath told thee come to passe saying let vs goe after other god which thou hast not knowne and serue them v thou shalt not hearken to the words of that prophet ampc againe god suffereth them for the punishment of vnbeleeuers and wicked man for oftentimes god punisheth one sinne by an other as the antecedent sinnes by the consequent this paul plainely sheweth speaking of the daies of antichrist that because man receiued not the loue of the truth therefore god would send vpon them strong illusions that they should beleeue lies and we may resolue our selues that for this very cause god suffereth the practises of witchcraft to be so rise in these our daies to punish the ingratitude of man who haue the truth reuealed vnto them and yet will not beleeue and obey the same but tread it vnder their feete that all they might be condemned which beleeued not the truth but tooke pleasure in vnrighteousnesse secondly this last clause is added to shewe that in the practises of sorcerie and witchcraft the deuill can doe so much onely as god permitts him and no more doubtlesse his malice reacheth further and consequently his will and desire but god hath restrained his power in the execution of his malitious poses whereupon he cannot goe a whit further then god giues him leaue and libertie to goe the magicians of egypt did some wonders in shew like vnto the miracles wrought by moses and aaron and that for a time by changing a rodde into a serpent and water into blood and by bringing froggs through he sleight and power of the deuill but when it pleased god to determine their practises and giue them no further liber ie they could not doe that which in likelihood was the meanest of all the rest the turning of the dust of the land into lice and themselues gaue the true reason thereof aving that this was the finger of god exod when the devil went out and became a false spirit in the mouth of all ahabs prophets to intise him to goe to fall at ramoth g le d he went not of his owne will but by the authoritie of god who commanded him to goe entise ahab and suffered him to preuaile king nd the act was not the act of satan but of god whose instrument he was and therefore the holy ghost saith by mi aiah the lord hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these thy prophets and the lord hath appointed euill against thee v hence also it was that the deuills beeing cast out of the man that had an vncleane spirit asked leaue of christ to enter into the heard of swine and could not enter in till he had permited them mark and we read oftentimes in the gospel that our sauiour cast out many deuills by his word onely thereby shewing that he was absolute lord ouer them and that without his permission they could doe nothing and thus much touching the generall of this article the ground of all the practises of witchcraft is a league or couenant made betweene the witch and the deuill wherein they doe mutually bind themselues each to other if any shall thinke it strange that man or woman should enter league with satan their vtter enemie they are to know it for a most euident and certen truth that may not be called into question and yet to cleare the iudgement of any one in this point i will set downe some reasons in way of proofe first the holy scripture doth intimate so much vnto vs in the psalm v where howsoeuer the comon translation runneth in other tearmes yet the words are properly to be read thus which heareth not the voyce of the mutterer ioyning societies cunningly and in them the psalmist layeth downe two points first the effect or worke of a charme muttered by the inchanter namely that it is able to stay the adder from s inging those which shall lay hold on him or touch him secondly the maine foundation of the charme societies or confederacies cunningly made not betweene man and man but as the words import betweene the inchanter and the deuill the like we read deuter where the lord chargeth his people when they come into the land of canaan that amongst other abominations of the heathen they should beware least any were found amongst them that ioyned societie that is entred into league and compact with wicked spirits a second reason may be this it is the practise of the deuill to offer to make a bargaine and couenant with man thus he dealt with our sauiour christ in the third temptation wherewith he assaulted him promising to giue vnto him all the kingdomes of the earth and the glorie of them which he shewed him in a vision if christ for his part would fall downe and worshippe him the offer was passed on the behalfe of satan and now to make a perfect compact betweene them there was nothing wanting but the free consent of our sauiour vnto the codition propounded whereby it is manifest that the deuill makes many couenants in the world because he findeth man and woman in the most places fitted for his turne in this kind who will not let to worship him for a farre lesse matter then a kingdome and it is not to be doubted that thousands in the world had they been offered so faire as christ was would haue beene as willing to haue yeelded vpon such conditions as the deuill to haue offered thirdly the common confession of all witches and so cerers both before and since the comming of christ doth yet more fully confirme the same for they haue confessed with one consent that the very ground worke of all their practises in this wicked article is their league with the deuill and hence it appeareth how and whereupon it is that sorcerers and witches can bring to passe strange things by the helpe of satan which other man ordinarily can not doe namely because they haue entred a league with him whereby he hath bound himselfe to them for the effecting of rare and extraordinarie workes which others not ioyned with him in the like confederacie are not able either by his helpe or any power or policie of their owne to bring to passe hereupon it was that the witch of endor shewed vnto saul the appearance of samuel which neither saul himselfe nor any in all his court could doe there was no great vertue in the matter or frame of her words for shee was ignorant and had no learning by power she could not effect it beeing a weake woman neither was it like that she had more cunning and pollicie then any of the learned iewes in those times had for such purposes the main reason was her league made with satan by vertue whereof shee commanded him to appeare in the likenes of samuel which neither saul nor any of his company could doe by vertue of such couenant which they had not made the ende why the deuill seeketh to make a league with man may be this it is a point of his policie not to be readie at euery mans command to doe for him what he would except he be sure of his reward and no other meanes will serue his turne for taking assurance hereof but this couenant and why so that hereby he may testifie both his hatred of god and his malice against man for since the time that he was cast down from heauen he hath hated god amp his kingdome and greatly maligned the happy estate of man especially since the couenant of grace made with ou first parents in paradise for he thought to hau brought vpon them by their fall eternall and finall confusion but perceiuing the contrarie by vertue of the couenant of grace then manifested and seeing m n by it to be in a better and surer estate then before he much more maligned his estate and beares the ranker hatred vnto god for that his mercie bestowed vpon him now that he might shew forth this hatred and malice he takes vpon him to imitate god and to counterfeit his dealings with his church as god therefore hath made a couenant with his people so satan ioynes in league with the world labouring to bind some man vnto him that so if it were possible he might drawe them from the couenant of god and disgrace the same againe as god hath his word and sacraments the seales of his couenant vnto beleeuers so the deuill hath his words and certaine outward signes to ratifie the same to his instruments as namely his figures characters gestures and other satanicall ceremonies for the confirmation of the truth of his league vnto them yes further as god in his couenant requires saith of vs to the beleeuing of his promises so the deuill in his compact requires faith of his vassalls to put their affiance in him and relie on him for the doing of whatsoeuer he bindes himselfe to doe lastly as god heares them that call vpon him according to his will so is satan readie at hand vpon the premisses endeauouring to the vtmost of his power when god permits him to bring to passe whatsoeuer he hath promised and so much of the league in generall more particularly the league betweene the deuill and a witch is twofold either expressed and open or secret and close the expresse and manifest compact is so tearmed because it is made by solemne words on both parties and it is not so expressely set downe in scriptures as in the writings of learned man which haue recorded the confessions of witches and they expresse it in this manner first the witch for his part as a slaue of the deuill binds himselfe vnto him by solemne vowe and promise to renounce the true god his holy word the couenant he made in baptisme and his redemption by christ amp withall to beleeue in the devil to expect amp receiue aide and helpe from him and at the end of his life to giue him either bodie or soule or both amp for the ratifying hereof he giues to the devil for the present either his owne hand writing or some part of his blood as a pledge amp earnest pennie to bind the bargaine the deuill on the other side for his part promiseth to be readie at his vassalls command to appeare at any time in the likenesse of any creature to consult with him to aide and helpe him in any thing he shall take in hand for the procuring of pleasures honour wealth or preferment to goe for him to carrie him wheth r he will in a word to doe for him whatsoeuer he shall commande many sufficient testimonies might he alleadged for the proofe hereof but it is so manifest in daily experience that it cannot well bee called into question but yet if it seeme strange vnto any that there should be such persons in the world that make such fearefull couenats with the deuill let them consider but this one thing and it will put them out of doubt the nature of man is exceeding impatient in crosses and outward afflictions are so tedious vnto mortall minds and presse them with such a measure of griefe that some could be contented with all their hearts to be out of the world if thereby they may be released of such extremitie and hereupon they care not what meanes they vse what conditions they vndertake to ease and helpe themselues the deuill finding man in these perplexities is ready to take his advantage and therefore perceiuing them now fitted for his purpose to worke vpon he insinuates and offers himselfe to procure them ease and deliuerance if they will vse such meanes as he shall prescribe for that purpose and to a naturall man there is no greater meane then this to make him ioyne societie with the deuill he therefore without any further doubting or deliberation condescendes to satan so as he may be based and releeued in these miseries againe we are to consider that in these cases the devil getteth the greater hold of man and mooues him to yeeld vnto his suggestions the rather because that which he promiseth to doe for him is present and at his command and therefore certaine whereas the thing to be performed on the behalfe of the partie himselfe as the giuing of bodie and soule ampc is to come sundry yeares after and therefore in regard of the particular time vncertaine now the naturall man not regarding his future and finall estate preferres the present commoditie before the losse and punishment that is to come a farre off and thereby is perswaded to yeeld himselfe vnto satan and by these and such like antecedents are many brought to make open league with the deuill the secret and close league between the witch and satan is that w erein they mutually giue consent each to other but yet without a sworne couenant conceiued in expresse words and conference of this there be two degrees first whe a ma vseth superstitions of prayer wherein he expressely requireth the helpe of the deuill without any mention of sol mine words or couenant going before that this is a kind of compact it is plaine because herein there is a mutuall vnder hand consent between the partie and the deuill though it be not manifest for when a to vse supersti ous formes of inuocation for helpe in time of need by the very vsing of them his heart consenteth to satan and he would gladly haue the thing effected when therefore the deuill hath notice of them and endeauo to effect the thing prayed for therein also he giues consent so as though there be no expresse words of compact outwardly framed on both parts yet the concurrence of a mutuall consent for the bringing to passe of the same things makes the couenant authentic for according to the receiued rules of equitie and reason mutuall consent of partie with partie is sufficient to make a bargaine though there be no solemne course or forme of words to manifest the same to others the second degree is when a man vseth superstitious meanes to bring any thing to passe which in his owne knowledge haue no such vertue in theselues to effect it without the especiall operation of the deuill superstitious meanes i call all those which neither by order of creation nor by the special appointment and blessing of god since haue any vertue in them to bring to passe that thing for which they are vsed for example a charme consisting of set words and syllables both rude barbarous and vnknowne vsed for the curing of some disease or paine is a superstitious meanes because it hath no vertue in it selfe to cure either by the gift of god in the creation or by any speciall appointment afterward in his word or otherwise and therefore when this meane is vsed by man which he knoweth hath no such vertue in it for the effecting of that worke for which it was vsed there is a secret league made with the deuill yet here i adde this clause in his owne knowledge to put a difference betweene man which vse superstitious meanes to bring some things to passe for some there be which when they vse them know they be meerely superstitious yes weake and impotent hauing no vertue in themselues for the purpose whereto they are vsed as the repeating of certain forms of words the vsing of signes characters and figures which in effect are meere charms no whit effectuall in theselues but so farre forth as they serue for watchwords vnto satan without whose ayde nothing is done by them a plaine argument that the vser hereof hath in his heart secretly indented with satan for the accomplishment of his intended workes a second sort there is which vseth them for some speciall end beeing perswaded that there is vertue in the meanes themselues to bring the thing to passe and yet not knowing that either they be superstitious or haue their efficacie by the power and worke of the deuill such persons haue made as yet no league with satan but they are in the high vvay thereunto and this course is a fit preparation to cause them to ioyne vvith him in couenant i shew it by an example a man is fallen into some extemitie and findes himselfe bewitched his paine is great and he desires with all his heart to be cured and deliuered hereupon he sendeth for the suspected witch beeing come he offers to scratch him or her thinking by this means to be cured of the witchcraft his reason is no other then a strong persvvasion that there is simply vertue in his scratching to cure him and discouer the witch not once suspecting that the helpe commeth by the power of the deuill but from the action it selfe this doing he may be healed but the truth is he sinneth and breakes god commandement for the vsing of these meanes is plaine witchcraft as aftervvard vve shall see and yet for all this the partie cannot be saide in present to haue made a league vvith satan because he thought that though he yeelded to the vse of superstitious meanes for his curing yet there had beene in the saide meanes a vertue of h ling vvithout any helpe or vvorke of the deuill witchcraft is of tvvo sorts divining or working for the whole nature of this article consisteth either in matter of diuination and coniecture or in matter of practise and in both these it is to be remembred that nothing can be effected vnlesse the partie haue made a league with the deuill expresse or secret or at the least a prepa ation thereunto by a false and erroneous opinion of the meanes diuination is a part of witchcraft whereby man reueale strange things either past prese or to come by the assistance of the deuill if it be here demanded how the deuill beeing a creature should be able to manifest and bring to light things past or to foretell things to come i answer first generally that satan in this particular worke transformes himselfe into n angel of light amp takes vpon him the exercise of these things in an ambitious though false imitation of diuine reuelations and predictions made and vsed by god in the times of the prophets amp apostles and this he doth as much is in him lieth to obscure the glorie of god and to make himselfe great in the opinion of ignorant and vnbeleeuing persons againe though satan be but a creature yet there be sundrie waies whereby he is able to diuine first by the scriptures of the old amp new testament wherein are set downe sundrie prophecies concerning things to come in the old testament are recorded many prophecies concerning the state of god church from the first age of the world till the comming of christ in the new testament likewise are recorded others touching the selfe same thing from the coming of christ in the latter daies to the ende of the world now the deuill beeing acquainted with the historie of the bible and hauing attained vnto a greater light of knowledge in the prophecies therein cotained then any man hath by stealing diuinations out of them he is able to tell of many strange things that may in time fall out in the world and answerably may shew them ere they come to passe for example alexander the great before he made war with darius king of persia consulted with the oracle that is with the deuill touching the euent and issue of his enterprise the oracle answered him thus alexander shall be a conquerour vpon the prediction of the oracle alexander wages war with darius and inuades asia and hauing conquered him translated the empire from persia to greece according as the oracle had said now if question bee made how the deuill knewe the euent of this war and consequently made it knowne to alexander the answer is by the helpe of a prophecie in the old testament for this thing was particularly set downe before hand by the prophet daniel daniel where he saith that a mightie king sh ll stand vp and shal rule with great dominion and doe according to his pleasure and this was alexander the great satan therefore knowing the secret meaning of the angels wordes vnto daniel framed out of them a true and direct answer whereas he was not able of himselfe to de ine certainly of the euent of things to come in particular the second meanes whereby the deuill is furnished for his purpose is his owne exquisite knowledge of all naturall things as of the influences of the starres the constitutions of man and other creatures the kinds vertues and operations of plants rootes hearbs stones ampc which knowledge of his goeth many degrees beyond the skill of all man yes euen of those that are most excellent in this kind as philosophers and physicians no marueile therefore though out of his experience in these and such like he is able aforehand to giue a likely gesse at the issues and euents of things which are to him so manifestly apparent in their causes a third helpe and furtherance in this point is his presence in the most places for some deuills are present at all assemblies and meetings and thereby are acquainted with the consultations and conferences both of princes amp people whereby knowing the drift and purpose of mens minds when the same is manifested in their speaches and deliberations they are the fitter to foretell many things which man ordinarily cannot doe and hence it is apparent how witches may know what is done in other country and whether one nation intends war against an other namely by satans suggestion who was present at the consultation and so knew it and reuealed it vnto them but how then comes it to passe that the consultations and actions of god church and children are not disclosed to their enemy euen by the vnspeakeable mercie and goodnesse of god who though for speciall causes sometimes he suffers satan by this meanes to bring things to light yet he hath restrained this his libertie and subiected it vnto his owne will so as he keepes him out of such meetings or compels him to conceale whereas otherwise his malice is so great tha not a word could be spoken but it should be carried abroad to the hurt amp disturbance both of churches and common wealths the fourth way is by putting into mens mindes wicked purposes and couns ls for after the league once made he laboureth with them by suggestions and where god giues him he neuer ceaseth perswading till he hath brought his enterprise to passe hauing therefore first brought into the minde of man a resolution to doe some euill he goes and reueales it to the witch and by force of perswasion vpon the partie tempted he frames the action intended to the time foretold and so finally deludes the witch his owne instrument foretelling nothing but what himselfe hath compassed and set about the fift helpe is the agilitie of satans nature whereby he is able speedily to conuay himselfe from place to place yes to passe through the whole world in a short ime for god hath made him by nature a spirit who by the gift of his creation hath attained the benefit of swiftnes not onely in dispatching his affairs but also in the cariage of his person with great expedition for the present accomplishment of his owne desires lastly god doth often vse satan as his instrument for the effecting of his intended workes and the executing of his iudgements vpon man and in those cases manifesteth vnto him the place where the time when and the manner how such a thing should be done now all such things as god wil haue effected by the deuill he may fortell before they come to passe because he knowes them before hand by reuelation and assignment from god thus by the witch of endor he foretolde to saul the time of his death and of his sonnes and the ruine of his kingdome saying to morow shalt thou and thy sonnes be with me and the lord shall giue the hoste of israel into the hands of the philisti s which particular euent and circumstances appertaining he did truely define not of himselfe but because god hath drawn away his good spirit from saul and had deliuered him to be guided by the deuill whome he also appointed as a meanes and vsed as an instrument to worke his ouerthrowe the scripture indeede maketh not particular mention of the time of sauls death it onely recordeth the manner thereof and that which followed vpon his death the translating of the kingdome to his neighbour dauid after him and yet because god vsed satan as an instrument to bring this to passe hereupon he was able to foretel the particular time when the will of god should be wrought vpon him and these be the ordinarie meanes and helpes whereby the deuill may knowe and declare strange thinges whether past present or to come neither may this seeme strange that satan by such meanes should attaine vnto such knowledge for euen man by their owne obseruations may giue probable coniectures of the state and condition of sundrie things to come thus we read that some by obseruation haue found out probably and foretold the periods of famille and kingdomes for example that the time and continuance of kingdomes is ordinarily determined at yeares or not much aboue and that great families haue not gone beyond the sixt and seauenth generation and as for speciall and priuate things the world so runnes as it vvere in a circle that if a man should but ordinarily obserue the course of things either in the vveather or in the body of man or othervvise he might easily foretell before hand vvhat would come after and by these and such like instances of experiences man haue gessed at the alterations and changes of estates and things in particular novv if man vvhich be but of short continuance and of a shallovv reach in comparison are able to doe such things hovv much more easily may the deuill hauing so great a measure of knovvledge and experience and beeing of so long continuance hauing also marked the course of all estates be able to foretell many things vvhich are to come to passe specially considering vvhat the wise man hath set downe to this purpose that that which hath beene shall be and that which hath beene done shall be done and there is no new thing vnder the sun eccl if it be here alledged that diuination is a prerogatiue of god himselfe and a part of his glorie incomunicable to any creature isa i answer things to come must be considered two waies either in themselues or in their causes and signes which either go with them or before them to foretell things to come as they are in themselues without respect vnto their signes or causes is a propertie belonging to god onely and the deuill doth it not by any direct and immediate knowledge of things simply considered in themselues but onely as they are present in their signes or causes again god foretelleth things to come certainely without the helpe of any creature or other meanes out of himselfe but the predictions of satan are onely probable and coniecturall and when he foretelleth any thing certainely it is by some reuelation from god as the death of saul or by the scripture as alexanders victory or by some speciall charge committed vnto him for the execution of god will vpon some particular places or persons as before hath beene shewed thus much for the causes of diuination now followe the parts and branches thereof diuination is of two sorts either in and by meanes or without meanes diuination by meanes is likewise of two sorts either by such as are the true creatures of god or those which are meerly counterfeit amp forged diuination by the true creatures of god is distinguished according to the number of the creatures into fiue distinct kinds whereof foure are mentioned in the scriptures the first is by the flying and noise of birds sorcerers among the heathen vsed to obserue foules in their flight for example whether they did flie on the right hand or on the left aboue them or below by them whether crosse and ouerthwart or directly against them in like manner they obserued the noise amp sound of the foule and both these waies sometimes by the noyse and sometimes by the flight they diuined of things to come both publike and priuate of good and bad successe in mans affaires of the state of kingdomes townes families and particular persons now this kind of diuination is condemned by moses deut let none be found among you that i adiuiner of diuinations that is as some intepret it a marker of the flying of foules or a charmer or a consulter with spirits or a soothsayer that is such a one as by obseruing the flying and noise of fowles takes vpon him to foretell good or bad successe the second kind of creatures vsed for diuinatio are the intralls of beast of which mention is made ezek where nabuchadnezzar being to make war both with the iewes and the ammonites and doubting in the way which enterprise to vndertake first he offers a sacrifice to the idol god and opening the bellie of the sacrifice looks vpon the liuer and by the signes therein found he iudgeth what should be the issue of the war which thing nabuchadnezzar did according to the vsuall practise of the heathen who when they were to make war or to attempt any businesse of importance were wont to offer sacrifice to their god and to prie into the intralls of the beast sacrificed for example the heart stomake splene kidneies but specially the liuer and by certaine signes appearing in those parts the deuill was wont to reueale vnthem what should be the successe of their affaires they had in hand it were easie to exemplifie both these sorts of diuination by sundrie particulars out of heathen writers but seeing the scripture hath manifested that there are such and experience shewes the same i will forbeare that labour and proceede but here it is demanded why both these kindes of diuination should be condemned in scripture considering they had so great applause among the heathen i answer because the flying of birds and the disposition of the inward parts of creatures are no true signes either of good or bad successe for that which is a true signe of a future euent must haue the vertue and power whereby it signifieth from god himselfe either by creation in the beginning or by his speciall ordinance and appointment afterward now it cannot be shewed that god in the creation infused any such vertue into the natures and motions of these creatures whereby they might signifie such things neither is there any apparent testimonie in the whole booke of the scriptures whereby it may be proued that since the creation they were appointed by god to serue such vses and endes and therefore howsoeuer they were esteemed of the heathen yet the word of god hath iustly censured them as no true and proper causes of diuination sanctified by god but meerely diabolicall it is alleadged that ioseph diuined by his cuppe as may appeare both by his stewards speech as also by his owne gen amp and yet that cuppe receiued no power from god either the one way or the other to be a cause or meane of diuination the answer anciently and commonly made is this that iosephs steward spake not as the thing was indeede but as the common receiued opinion was among the egyptians who esteemed ioseph to be a man of great skill and wisdome able by sundrie meanes to diuine and prophesie to this i adde a second answer that the steward spake not as he thought but his purpose was in those words to coceale the knowledge of ioseph his master from his brother that thereby they might not discerne who he was but take him to be an egyptian thirdly the words may not vnfitly admit this interpretation as if the steward had said know ye not that this cuppe which i finde in the sackes mouth of your yongest brother is that whereby my master will easily prooue what manner of man you are this answer is also auncient and may well be receiued it is further obiected that our sauiour christ by his speech vnto the pharisies seemeth to approoue of diuining by creatures as by winds and by clouds when you see a cloud saith he rising out of the west straight way you say a showre commeth and so it is and when you see the south wind blow ye say that it will be hoate and it commeth to passe luke ans there be some kinds of predictions that are and may be lawfully vsed because they are naturall of which sort are those that are made by physicians mariners and husbandmen touching the particular alterations and dispositions of the weather and these beeing agreeable to that order which god hath set in nature from the beginning by them a man may probably gather the state of the weather whether it will be faire or foule and of these naturall signs our sauiour christ speaketh not of diabolicall which haue no warrant either from the common course of nature created or by any speciall appointment from god so that whatsoeuer can be said in their defence this yet remaineth certaine that the slying and noise of birds and the state of the intralls of beast are no true signes ordained by god but inuented by the deuill and his instruments and therefore all diuination by them is iustly condemned as wicked and deuillish whence it appeareth what iudgement may be giuen of those common signes of diuination which are obserued in the world specially of the more ignorant sort for example a man finds a piece of iron he presently conceiueth a prediction of some good lucke vnto himselfe that day if he light on a peice of siluer then he stands contrarily affected imagining some euill will befall him againe when a man is taking his iourney if a hare crosse him in the way all is not well his iourney shall not be prosperous it presageth some mischiefe towards him let his cares tingle or burne he is perswaded he hath enemy abroad and that some man either then doth or presently will speake ill of him if the salt fall towards a man at the table it portendeth in common conceit some ill newes when a rauen stands vpon some high place looke what way he turnes himselfe and cries thence as some thinke shall shortly come a dead corps albeit this sometime may be true by reason of the sharpe sense of smelling in the raven these and sundrie other of the like sort are meerely superstitious for the truth is they haue no vertue in themselues to foreshewe any thing that is to come either in nature or by god ordinance therefore whatsoeuer diuination is made by them must needes be fetched from satanicall illusion and though we cannot say they be soothsayings or tearme the vsers and fauourers of them soothsayers yet we may safely referre them to this kinde of diuining beeing such as no christian may warrantably vse though some of them be not so grosse and palpable as those that are condemned in the scriptures the third kind of creatures vsed to diuine by are the starres diuination by starres s commonly called iudiical astrologie of which we may read deu where the holy ghost doth of purpose reckon vp all those kinds of deuillish arts whereby man haue dealings and societie with satan either in divining or practising among which this is the second the word there vsed may carrie a double sense for it signifieth either him that obserueth times vnder which acception astrologie is comprehended or him that obserueth the clouds and howsoeuer the best learned interpreters doe dissent about the notation of it yet all agree in this that this profession of diuining by the starres is there condemned and that it is to be numbred among the rest expressed in the prohibition may further appeare by other places of scripture as in isa where the lord threatneth the same iudgements against diuiners by the starre that he doth against soothsaiers and magicians againe in daniel inchaunters astrologians and sorcerers are ioyned together as beeing all sent for about the same busines v z to expound the kings dreame nowe if the lord himselfe haue allotted the same punishment to the astrologer which he hath to the soothsaier amp magician and account them all one it is manifest that diuining by the starres ought to be held as a superstitious kind of diuination here if it be thought strange that predictions by so excellent creatures as the starres be should carrie both the name and nature of diabolicall practises which can be done by none but such as are in league with satan i answer the reasons hereof are these first it must be considered that the drift and scope of this article is to foretell the particular euents of things contingent as the alteration of the states of kingdomes the death of princes good or badde successe of mens particular affaires from the houre of their birth to the day of their death and from this all man may iudge what the article it selfe is for the foretelling of things to come which in their owne nature are contingent and in regard of vs casuall i say not in regard of god to whome all things are certenly knowne is a propertie peculiar to god alone and not within the power of any creature man or angel a point that is plainely taught by the prophet esai from the chap of his prophesie to the the scope whereof is to prooue that it is a prerogatiue appointed to the deitie and not communicable to the creature to foreshew the euet of things to come which in our vnderstanding and reach may either be or not be and which when they are may be thus or otherwaies it remaines therefore that diuinations of this kind taking from god his right and robbing him of his honour are iustly censured of impietie amp are in themselues wicked and abominable it is alleadged that starres in the heauens are the causes of many things happening in the world and therefore to practise by them in this manner deserueth no such imputation ans it cannot be denied that they are causes of some things but i demand what causes not particular of particular euents but generall and common that worke alike vpon all things and no man can diuine of a particular euent by a generall cause vnlesse he also know the particular causes subordinate to the generall and the particular dispositions and operations of them for example let twentie or thirtie egges of sundrie kinds of birds be taken and set vnder one and the same henne to be hatched it is not possible for any man onely vpon the bare consideration of the heate of the hen which is the generall cause of hatching the egges to set downe certainely what kind of bird each egge will bring forth vnlesse he know what the egges were particularly for a generall and common cause doth not immediately produce a particular effect but onely mooueth and helpeth the particular immediate and subordinate causes therefore the heat of the henne doth not make one egge to send forth a henne chicken another egge a ducke a third a swanne ampc but onely helpeth it forward by sitting and crouching vpon them in like manner the starres are generall causes of naturall things as the heat of the hen is of the hatching of the egges and by them no man can rightly define of particular euents and therefore diuination by the slarres whereby are fore told particular contingent euents in kingdomes families or particular persons is but a forged skill that hath no ground in nature from the vertue of the starres for any such purpose a second reason may be this all the rules and precepts of astrologie set downe by the most learned among the chaldeans egyptians and other astrologers are nothing els but meer dotages and fictions of the braine of man for the rules and conclusions of all good and lawful arts haue their ground in experience and are framed by obseruation whereupon they are called axioms or positions of arte so generally and vndoubtedly true that they can not deceiue but these rules are of a contrarie nature hauing no foundation in experience at all for if they had this must needes follow that the position of the heauens and the course of all the stars must needs continue one and the same for the principles of article ought to be immutable but neither the position of the heauens nor the course of all the starrs is alway one and the same againe he that would make sound rules of article by obseruation must know the particular estate of all things he obserueth but no man knoweth the particular estate of all the starres and consequently none can gather sound rules of arte by them thirdly no man knoweth or seeth all the starres and though they might be all discerned yet the particular vertues of those which are seene can not be knowne because their influences in the aire and vpon the earth are confused and therefore by obseruation of them no rules can be made whereby to iudge of particular euents to come that be contingent but experience teacheth may some say that if a man addicted to this course shall practise the rules of astrologie it will fall out that the most things he foretelleth shall be true and come to passe accordingly which beeing verified in experience it should seeme that these principles are not vncerten for how is it possible that vpo false grounds should proceede true predictions to this obiection learned diuines haue framed answer thus that in this there is a secret magicke at the least if not an open league with satan for looke what is wanting to the effect of the starrs the deuill maketh supply of it by his owne knowledge in things that are to come to passe and this is the iudgement of them that haue knowne this arte which was also receiued for true in the daies of the apostles the third reason the man that repaireth to the astrologian vpo the particular case for his helpe and counsell must beleeue that he can and will doe for him otherwise if he come doubting of his ability or in way of tempting him he can not helpe him now in common vnderstanding if the diuiner brings the thing to passe here must needes be more then arte for he that is master of a lawful arte can worke by his rules whether a man beleeue that he can or no yes though all the man in the world should doubt his rules would be effectuall the arte therefore it selfe is the old superstitious arte of the chaldeans which they beeing idolaters first ferched from the deuill and his oracles yes the practise thereof is nothing but superstitious sorcerie and the vndertakers no better then sorcerers if any man doubt hereof their writings are sufficient testimonies and they theselues auouch it for it is a rule and maxime among them in all kind o sorcerie that the learner must come credulous and not doubting or to tempt otherwise no answer can be giuen but notwithstanding all these reasons alleadged for the proofe of this point sundrie things are opposed to the contrarie for first it is saide that the sun moone and starres were created for signes gen and therefore that it is lawful to diuine by them seeing that in so doing we doe but vse them to the ende for which god made them ans the reason is of no force the starres indeede by this ordinance doe serue for signes but of what not of all things but as the text plainly sheweth of daies weekes months and yeare yes of the seasons of the yeare as of spring summer autumne and winter yes further of the alterations of the weather in generall but all this maketh nothing to ratifie diuination of particular euents in things cotingent which are to fal out in the state of kingdomes families and persons for they are not causes but signes and that of some generall things onely not of particular againe it is said that moses amp daniel two famous prophets are commended for their skill in this article for of moses it is saide act that he was learned in all the wisedome of the egyptians and daniel in all the wisdome of the chaldeans daniel and we know that the egyptians and chaldeans were the masters of diuination and eminent aboue all others in matter of astrologie ans it cannot be prooued out of those places that moses or daniel were trained vp in this article and though it should be granted they were yet it follows not that they were practisers of it at least continually for albeit beeing children and of tender yeares in the courts of pharaoh and nebuchadnetsar they had beene trained vp by their gouernours in this knowledge it may not thence be concluded that they finally submitted themselues to the practise thereof considering that a man may learne that when he is yong which afterward vpon better iudgement and consideration he may vtterly disclame and so we are to thinke of them that after god had called them they did for euer lay aside all such wicked and deuillish practises forbidden by god and yet in vse among the egyptians and chaldeans thirdly it is obiected the starres are admirable creatures of god and the causes of many straunge effects in the aire in the water and vpon the earth also in body of man and beast it may seeme therefore not unlawful to diuine by them ans we graunt that the s arres and especially the sun and moone haue great vertue and force vpon the creatures that are below partly by their light and partly by their heat but hence it will not follow that they are or may be lawfully vsed for diuination for whereas it hath beene shewed that the grounds of all good arts are gathered by obseruation and experience it is not possible for any man truly and certenly to obserue all particular euents brought forth by the starres whereupon hee might ground his rules and for proofe hereof suppose there were a heape of all kinds of hearbs growing vpon the earth gathered together which should be all strained into one vessell and the liquour brought to the most skilfull physitian that is or euer was can we thinke him able by tasting or smelling thereof to distinguish the vertues of the hearbs and to say which is which to doe this when all were seuered each from other is a hard matter yet possible considering they haue their seuerall natures and operations but in this confused mixture to discerne the seueralls is a thing passing the skill of man the like may be said of the particular vertue of euery star for they all haue their operation in the body of man and other creatures but their vertues beeing all mixed together in the subiect whereon they worke can no more be knowne distinctly then the vertues of a masse of hearbs of infinite sorts beaten together for this is an vndoubted truth in nature that the vertues of celestiall body in their operations are mingled with the qualities of the elements in the inferiour body amp the vertues of them all doe so concurre that neither the heate or light of the starres nor the vertue of he elements can be seuered one from another and therefore though there be notable vertue in the starres vet in regard of the mixture thereof in their operation no man is able to say by obseruation that this is the vertue of this starre and this of that the seauen planets beeing more notable then the other lights of the heauen specially the sun and the moone haue their operations and effects plainely and perfectly knowne as for the other there was neuer any man that could either feele their heate or certenly determine of any thing by them there being th some stars whose vertues are vnknowne how can their operations and effects be discerned in particular therefore no rules can be made by obseruation of the vertues of the starres in their operations whereupon we may foretell particular euents of things contingent either concerning mens persons families or kingdomes a fourth reason all starres haue their worke in the qualities of heate light cold moisture and drinesse as for the secret influences which man dreame of comming from them besides the saide qualities they are but forged fancies the scripture neuer mentioneth any such neither can it be prooued that the sun hath any efficacie vpon inferiour body but by light and heate which because they are mixt with other qualiti s they affo rd no matter of prediction touching particular euents for hat though the celestiall body doe use in the terrestriall heate and cold drought and moisture doth it therfore follow that these effects doe declare before hand the constitution of mans bodie the disposition of mens minds the affections of mens hearts or finally what successe they shall haue in their affaires touching wealth honour and religion hence i conclude that diuining by them in this sort is meere superstition and a kinde of sorcerie for which cause in scripture astrologians are iustly numbred among sorcerers now that which hath beene saide touching this point may serue for speciall vse and first it giues a caueat to all students that they haue care to spend their time and wits better then in the studie of iudiciall astrologie and rather imploy themselues in the searching out of such things as may most serue for the glorie of god and the good of his church it is the subtiltie of satan to draw man into such meditations and to make this studie so pleasant that it can hardely be left when it is once begun but let them take heede betime for assuredly these vaine and superstitious practises are not the builders and furtherers but the hinderers and destroyers of religion and the feare of god againe this must admonish them which suffer any losses not to seeke for helpe or remedie at the hands of astrologers commonly called figure casters for their directions in the recouerie of thing lost or stollen commeth not by the helpe of any lawful article but from the worke of the deuill reuealing the same vnto them and be ter it were to loose a thing finally and by faith to expect till god make supplie another way then in this manner to recouer it again yes the curse of god hangeth ouer the head of him that to helpe himselfe vseth diabolicall meanes for put the case thing lost of great value be againe restored by the helpe of satan yet god in his iustice for the vse of these vnlawful meanes ma take from the consulter twice as much or at least his grace and so giue him vnto a reprobate sense to beleeue the deuill to his vetter perdition thirdly it serueth to admonish vs of some other vanities that accompanie astrologie specially of two the first is the obseruation of the signe in mans bodie wherein not onely the ignorant sort but man of knowledge doe far e ouershoot themselues superstitiously holding that the signe is specially to be marked an opinion in it selfe fantasticall and vaine not grounded in nature but borrowed from astrologie for the astrologians for better expressing and establishing thereof haue deuised newe spheres in the heauens more then indeede there be to wit the ninth and the tenth and in the tenth commonly called the first mooueable haue placed an imaginarie sphere which they tearme the zodiacke and in the zodiack twelue signes aries taurus gemini and the rest which they imagine to haue power ouer the twelue parts of mans bodie as aries the head and face taurus necke and throat ampc but these are onely twelue imaginarie signes for in the heauens there is no such matter as a ramme a bull ampc and how can it stand with reason that in a firmament fained by poets and philosophers a forged signe which indeede is nothing should haue any power or operation in the body of man again the very order of the gouernment of these signes in mans bodie is fond and without shew of reason for according to this platforme when the moone commeth into the first signe aries shee ruleth in the head amp when shee commeth into the second signe taurus in the necke and so descends downe from part to part in some part ruling two in some three daies ampc where obserue that the moone is made then to rule in the cold and moist parts when shee is in hoate and drie signes when as in reason a more consonant order were this that when the moone were in hoate and drie signes as aries leo and sagittarius shee should rule in hoat and drie parts of the bodie and when shee is in colde and moist signes shee should rule in the colde and moist parts of the body and so still gouerne those parts which in temperature come nearest to the nature of the signes wherein the moone is besides this some learned physitians haue vpon experience confessed that the obseruation of the signe is nothing materiall and that there is no danger in it for gelding of cattell or letting of blood indeede it preuailes oftentimes by an old conceit and strong imagination of some vnlettered persons who thinke it to be of force and efficacie for restoring and curing and yet the vanitie of this conceit appeares in the common practise of man who commonly vpon s stevens day vse to let blood be the signe where it will though it be in the place where the veine is opened but the truth is the signe in it owne nature is neither way auaileable beeing but a fancie grounded vpon supposed premisses and therefore ought to be reiected as a meere vanitie the second thing belonging to astrologie which ought to be eschewed is the choice and obseruation of daies curious diuiners doe set apart certaine dayes whereof some are as they say luckie some vnluckie and these they appoint to be obserued for the beginning of ordinary works amp businesses as to take a iourney to beginne to lay the foundation of a building to plant a garden to weane a child to put on new apparell to flit into a new house to traffic into other country to goe about a suite to a prince or some great man to hunt and vse exercises to pare the nayles to cut the haire in a word to attempt any thing in purpose or action which is not done euery day the effect and force of these daies is not grounded either in arte or in nature but onely in superstitious conceit and diabolicall confidence vpon a wicked custome borrowed from the practise of diuiners and the daunger of such confident conceits is this that the deuill by them takes the vantage of fantasticall persons and brings them further into league and acquaintance with himselfe vnlesse they leaue them and all such persons as make difference of daies for this or that purpose are in expresse words plainly condemned deut the fourth kind of diuination by true meanes is the prediction of things to come by dreames in the old testament we read tha sorcerers and false prophets vsed to foretell strange euents by reuelations which they had in their dreames such diuiners were among the iewes and for that cause the people of god were expressely forbidden to harken vnto dreamers of dreames deut and the lord himselfe by the prophet ieremie taxeth the false prophets who broached false doctrine in his name by this deuillish meanes saying i haue dreamed i haue dreamed ier yet here it is to be remembred that foretelling of future things by dreames is not simply to be condemned but onely in part for of dreames there be three sorts diuine naturall and diabolicall diuine are those which come from god naturall which proceede from a mans owne nature and arise from the qualitie and constitution of the bodie diabolicall which are caused by the suggestion of the deuill touching diuine dreames that there are or at least haue beene such it is euident for these be the words of god numb if there be a prophet of the lord among you i will be knowne vnto him by a vision and will speake vnto him by a dreame and iob saith that god speaketh in dreames and visions of the night when sleepe falleth vpon man and they sleepe vpon their beds iob now these diuine dreames were caused in man either immediately by god himselfe as the former places shew or by meanes of some good angel in this latter kind was ioseph of en admonished in dreames what to doe by the ministerie of an angel as matth and chap and diuining by such dreames is not condemned for by them the most worthie prophets of god haue reueiled god will in many things to his church thus ioseph by dreame had notice giuen him of his owne advancement gen and by pharaohs dreames which were sent from god he also foretold the state of the kingdome of egypt touching prouision for seauen years dearth gen by the same meanes the prophet daniel prophesied of the flourishing amp fading of the chiefe monarchy of the world from his time to the comming of christ daniel ampc these therefore beeing one of the extraordinary means whereby god hath manifested his will vnto man in times past more or lesse diuination by them is not to be censured as unlawful but rather to be honoured and esteemed as the ordinance of god for the second sort which be naturall arising either from the thoughts of the mind or the affections of the heart or the constitution of the bodie as they are ordinarie in all me in some more in some lesse so they vary according to the diuersitie of mens thoughts affections and constitutions and by them a man may probably coniecture of sundrie things concerning the state and disposition partly of his bodie and partly of his minde as first he may gesse in likelihood what is his constitution as the learned in all ages doe constantly auouch for when his mind in dreaming runnes vpon warrs and contentions fire and such like it argueth his complexion is cholerick when he dreames of water and it betokeneth abundance of phlegme when his phantasie conceiueth heauie and dolefull things full of griefe feare and horrour it bewraieth a melancholike constitution when his dreames be ioyfull and pleasant as of mirth pastimes and delightful newes his complexion is iudged to be sang i againe by naturall dreames a man may gess ar the corruption of his owne heart and know to what sinnes he is most naturally inclined for looke what mon doe ordinarily in the day time conceiue and imagine in their corrupt hearts of the same for the most part they d e corruptly dreame in the night and this is the rather to be obserued because though the wicked man shut his eyes and stoppe his eares and harden his heart and will not take notice of his enormities by the light of the law yet euen by his owne dreames in the night his wickednes shall be in part discouered and his conscience thereby conuinced and he himselfe left in the end inexcusable before god now albeit a man may giue a probable coniecture of the premisses by natural drems yet no diuination of things to come whether publike or priuate good or bad can be made by them either concerning persons families or kingdoms therefore the common obseruations of dreames in the world whereby man imagine things to come to passe amp accordingly foretel them by those means are vaine and superstitious and iustly so condemned in the places before named deut ier concerning the thirde kinde of dreames which are caused by the devil it hath beene granted in all ages for a truth that satan can frame dreames in the brayne of man and by them reueale his diui ations and it is plainly manifested by the continuall obseruation of the gentiles before the comming of christ for when oracles that is answers from the deuill were in force man that vsed to consult with them and desired to be resolued in matters of doubt were to lay them downe and sleepe beside the altar of apollo where they had offred their gift and sleeping they receiued in a dreame the answer for which they came and this dreame was framed in the braine of him that slept by the deuill and in it the answer was deliuered by him speaking at or in the oracle so likewise in the primitiue church since the comming of christ though oracles then ceased which were the greatest and strongest delusions that euer satan had yet he hath by dreames and visions wrought in the heads of many man most strange and curious concei s for the raising vp of heresies to the great disturbance of the peace of the church for we read in ecclesiasticall stori s that the maniches had their damnable opinions first inspired into them and then confirmed by dreames and in this age the first authors of the sect of the anabaptists had their curious conceits of reuelation partly in dreames partly in visions likewise the familie of loue haue their reuelations in dreames for he that desires to become one of that sect must ascend thereunto by degrees before he can come to perfection to be an elder illuminate or a man deified to which estate when he is once come he hath for his confirmation strong illusions both waking and sleeping in visions and dreames history of latter times and wofull experience sheweth this to be true the deuill preuailing so strongly that many haue fallen away by this meanes beeing corrupted by a doctrin meerely carnall howsoeuer maintained with pretense of great holynes againe as the good angels may cause diuine dreames from god and therei reuile vnto man his will and pleasure concerning things to come so no doubt the euill spirits may cause in man diabolicall dreames and therein reueile vnto them many strange things which they by meanes vnknowne to man may foresee and knowe by all which it is euident that there are and may be as well diabolicall as diuine dreames the conclusion then is this that as diuining by the second sort is superstitious hauing no ground from god word so fortelling by this third sort is flat witchcraft directly condemned in the places aforenamed where man are forbidden to prophesie by them or to regard them yet forasmuch as dreames be of sundrie kinds as hath beene said it shall not be amisse to set downe some notes of difference betweene them whereby they may be knowne and distinguished each from other which point indeede hath long agone beene handled in the primitiue church but hardly determined for the learned of that age haue auouched it a very hard matter considering that the deuill in these as well as in other things can transforme himselfe into an angel of light but howsoeuer the case be hard and the devil politicke yet by light of direction from the word of god there may some true differences be set downe betweene them as namely these first of all diuine dreames haue alwaies had their preeminence aboue others that generally they haue concerned the weightiest matters in the world as the comming and exhibiting of the messias the changes and alterations of kingdomes the reueiling of antichrist amp the state of the church of god and this may plainly appeare by those which ioseph expounded vnto pharaoh and daniel vnto the kings of babel and persia but in the other sort it is otherwise for if there be any thing represented more then ordinarie in those that be naturall it proceedeth meerely from fancie and imagination and as for diabolical they are not of so waightie matters nor so hard to foretell for though the deuill haue great power and skill yet it is aboue his reach to determine of such things as these are or to foretell them without helpe from god secondly diuine dreames be alwaies either plaine and manifest or if they be obscure yet they haue a most euident interpretation annexed vnto them of the plainer sort were the dreames of ioseph the husband of marie matth of the other sort were pharaohs very darke and hidden but god raised vp ioseph to giue them an casie interpretation vpon the instant gen nebuchadne sars dreames were full of obscuritie and many matters were contained in the so as his spirit was troubled and he forgat them but god stirred vp daniel and reuealed to him the secret so as he remembred it to the king and declared the true meaning thereof daniel lastly daniels dreames of the foure beast ampc were of like difficultie but the angel gabriel was presently sent to make him vnderstand them daniel now those that are caused by the deuill as they be obscure and intricate so the interpretation of them is ambiguous and vncertaine because he himselfe cannot infallably determine how things shall come to passe and thereupon is constrained to giue doubtfull answers by dreames and such were not onely the auncient oracles among the heathen where he gaue the resolution but the moderne prophecies giuen by him to some of his instruments in later time thirdly the dreame that comes from god is alwaies agreeable to his reuealed will and representeth nothing contrarie to the same in whole or in part whereas those that proceed from nature doe sauour of nature and bee agreeable to mans corruption which is repugnant vnto god will and those that are suggested by satan are of the same nature the generall scope whereof is to crosse the will of god and to withdrawe the heart from obedience therevnto fourthly diuine dreames a this ende to further religion and ple e and to maintaine true doctrine but the deuill an enemie to god worketh in his dreames the subuersion of true religion amp the worship of god that in the roome thereof he may set vp idolatry and superstition for so much we learne deut where the false prophet brings his dreame and vtters it yes and confirmeth it by a wonder but marke his ende it was to draw man to apostacie let vs saith he goe after other god which thou hast not knowne and let vs serue them verse answerable to which was the practise of the false prophets afterwardes who caused the people to erre y their lies and flatteries ierem to conclude this point it must be here remembred that howsoeuer there re and haue beene distinct sorts of dreams yet those which are from god were onely in ordinarie vse in the old testament and in the church of the new are ceased and take not place ordinarily whereas therefore man in their sleepes haue dreames they must take them commonly to be naturall amp withall know that they may be diabolicall or mixt partly of the one kind partly of the other and howsoeuer there may be some vse of the naturall as hath beene said yet commonly they are not to be regarded and for the other which are from satan or mixt they are not to be receiued beleeued or made meanes whereby to foretell things to come least by this vse of them we grow into familiaritie with the deuill and before god be guilty of the sin of witchcraft the fift and last kind of diuination by true meanes is by lots when man take vpon them to search out fortune as they vse to speake that is good or bad successe in any busines by casting of lots whether it be by casting a die or opening of booke or any such casuall meanes i mention this the rather because among the ignorant and superstitious sort such practises are comon amp in great accout the lot is an ordinance of god appointed for speciall ends and purposes but when it is thus applyed it ceaseth to be lawful because it is abused to other ends then god by his word amp ordinance hath allowed that we may the better knowe the abuse of a lot in this kind we must remember there be three sorts of lots the ciuill the sporting and the diuining lot the ciuill vse of lots is when they be vsed for the ending of controuersies the diuiding of lands and heritages the disposition of offices amongst many that are equally fit the trying of the right in doubtfull things or lastly the discouerie of a malefactor hid amongst many suspected by this vse of the lot was saul chosen to be king ouer israel sam the skape goate separated fro that which was to be sacrificed leuit the land of canaan diuided among the children of israel iosh ampc the trespasse of achan found out iosh and matthias chosen to be one of the twelue act and of this lot salomon saith pro the lot causeth contentions to cease and maketh partitions among the mightie hereupon the ciuill vse of lots hath his warrant in god word so it be lawfully vsed in case of necessitie with i uocation of the name of god and with expectation of the euent from god by whose hand amp immeadiate prouidence it is disposed for the lot saith salomon is cast into the lap but the whole disposition thereof is from the lord pro the sporting lot is that which is commonly vsed for some vaine and vnnecessary ende as to set vp banck rupts or such like this hath no warrant in the word of god whereupon man should vse it and therefore is no better then an abuse of god ordinance to speake no more of it now the diuining lot performed by the opening of a booke or the casting of a die or such like thereby to declare good or bad successe cannot be done without confederacie with satan either explicite or implicite for the plaine cast of a die or the opening of a booke without beleeuing can doe nothing for discouering of future contingents and what is there in the nature of these actions to produce such effects or where or when did god giue this vertue to them certainely to determine of things hidden from man and knowne onely to himselfe diuination therefore by them is to be holden as a practise not onely sauouring of superstition but proceeding from the arte of witchraft and sorcetie and thus much of diuination by meanes of the creatures and the seueral kinds thereof the second kind of diuination is by counterfeit and forged meanes which are none of the creatures of god whereof one kind onely is mentioned in scripture viz when satan is consulted with in the shape of a dead man this is commonly called neeromaneie or the blacke arte because the deuill being sought vnto by witches appeares vnto them in the likenes of a dead bodie and it is expressely forbidden deuter yes condemned by the prophet esai who saith in plaine tearmes that god people ought not to goe from the liuing to the dead but to the law and to the testimonie a memorable example hereof is recorded in sam the obseruation whereof will discouer vnto vs the chiefe points of necromancie there saul about to encounter the philisti s beeing forsaken of god who refused to answer him either by dreames or by vrim or by the prophets inquired for one that had a familiar spirit and hearing of the pythonesse at endor went vnto her by night and caused her to raise vp samuel to tell him of the issue of the war now the witch at his request raised vp the deuill with whome shee was confederate in samuels likenesse who gaue him answer concerning his owne ouerthrowe and the death of his sonnes which example declareth plainely that there is a kind of diuination whereby witches and sorcerers reueale strange things by means of the deuill appearing vnto the in the shapes or shadowes of the dead touching the truth of this example two questions may be mooued the first is whether that which appeared was true samuel or not some say it was samuel indeede others who hold that there are no witches denie that it was either samuell or the deuill and affirme it to be some other counterfeit comming in samuels attire to deceiue saul both which opinious are false and here to be confuted and first that their opinion which say that true samuel appeared vnto saul is a flat vntruth i prooue by these reasons i before this time god had withdrawne his spirit from saul as himselfe confesseth and denied to answer him any more by ordinarie meanes in such sort as before he had done hereupon i gather that it is was not probable that god would now vouchsafe him the fauour to suffer samuel to come vnto him extraordinarily and tell him what should be the end of his war with the philistins and to this purpose it is affirmed twise in that chapter that god had taken his good spirit from saul ii the soules of the faithfull departed are in the hands of god and doe rest in glorie with himselfe and their body are in the earth and there rest in peace so saith the voice from heauen revelation blessed are the dead that die in the lord for they rest from their labours and their works that is the reward of their workes follow them immediatly or at the heeles as the word signifieth now suppose the deuill had power ouer samuels bodie yet to make true samuel he must haue his soule also but it is not in the power of the deuill to bring againe the soules that are in heauen vnto their body and so to cause them to appeare vnto man vpon earth and to speake vnto them the deuills kingdome is in hell and in the hearts of wicked man on earth yes whiles the children of god are in this world he vsurpeth some authoritie ouer them by meanes of their owne corruption but heauen is the kingdome of god and his saints where satan hath nothing to doe considering that there is no flesh or corruption to make him entrance or yeeld him intertainement neither can it be prooued by scripture that the deuill can disturbe either the body or soules of them that die in the lord and therefore the witch with all her power and skill could not bring samuels rotten bodie for so no doubt it was now and soule together iii this shape which appeared suffered saul to adore and worshippe it where is the true samuel would neuer haue receiued adoration from saul the king though it had beene in ciuill manner onely whome then did saul adore answer the deuill himselfe who beeing an enemie to the glorie of god was content to take to himselfe that honour which a king in dutie is to performe to god himselfe iv if it had beene true samuel he would certainly haue reproued saul for seeking helpe at witches contrarie to god commandement amp that doctrine which he had taught him from god in his life time but this counterfeit reproued him not and therefore it is not like to be the true prophet of god but satan himselfe framing by his article and skill the person and shape of samuel but it is alleadged to the contrarie that samuel a ter his sleepe prophesied of the death of saul ecclesiastic v a ter his sleepe also he told of the kings death ampc answer that booke penned by iesus the son of sirach is a very worthie description of christian ethicks contaming more excellent precepts for manners then all the writings of heathen philosophers or other man but yet it is not scripture neither did the church euer hold and receiue it as c onicall yes the author himselfe sinuateth so much in the beginning thereof for in the preface he disableth himselfe to interpret hard things and after a sort craues pardon for his weaknesse which is not the manner of the man of god that were penmen of scripture for they were so guided by god spirit in their proceedings that nothing could be hard vnto them this priuiledge no ordinarie man hath assurance of and therefore this author writing vpon his owne priuate motion was subiect to error and no doubt this speach of his beeing contrarie to that which is recorded in the canonicall scriptures is a flat vntruth secondly it is obiected that the scripture calleth him samuel that appeared vnto saul ans the scripture doth often speake of things not as they are in themselues but as they seeme to vs so it is affirmed gen that god made two great lights the sun and moone whereas the moone is less then many starres yet because in regard of her nearenesse to the earth shee seemeth to vs greater then the rest therefore shee is called a great light in like manner idols in the scripture are called god not that they are so indeed for an idoll is nothing corinthian but because some man doe so conceiue of them in their mindes in a word the scripture oftentimes doth abase it selfe to our conceit speaking of things not according as they are but after the manner of man and so in this place calleth counterfeit samuel by the name of the true samuel because it seemed so vnto saul the third obiection that bodie which appeared prophecied of things that came to passe the day after as the death of saul and of his sonnes which indeede so fel out and at the same time therefore was like to be samuel answer there is nothing there said or done which the deuill might not doe for when the lord vseth the deuill as his instrument to bring some things to passe he doth before hand reueile the same vnto him and looke what particulars the deuill learneth from god those he can foretell now the truth is satan was appointed by god to worke sauls ouerthrowe and it was made knowne vnto him when the thing should be done by which meanes and by none other the deuill was enabled to foretell the death of saul where by the way obserue that in this case the deuill can reueale things to come certenly to wit if he be appointed god immediate instrument for the execution of them or knowes them by light of former prophecies in scripture fourthly dead man doe often appeare and walke after they are buried ans it is indeede the opinion of the church of rome and of many ignorant persons among vs but the truth is otherwise dead man doe neither walke nor appeare in bodie or soule after death for all that die are either righteous or wicked the soules of the righteous goe straight to heauen and the soules of the wicked to hell and their remaine till the last iudgement and therefore of the iust it is said that they are blessed when they die because they rest from their labours apocrypha but how doe they rest if after they be dead they wander vp and downe in the earth if it be said that moses and elijah appeared when christ was transsigured in the mount and that lazarus rose again and at christs resurrection many dead body rose againe and appeared i answer there were two times when god suffered the dead to be raised vp againe either at the plant of his church or at the restoring and establishing of it when it was rased to the foundation thus at the restoring of religion in elijah and elishaes times the son of the shunamitish woman king and the widowes son at sarephta king were raised againe when god would restore his church which was fallen to idolatry about the death of elisha he caused the like miracle to be wrought in the reuiuing of a dead man by the touching of elishaes dead carkeise in the graue thereby to assure the people of their deliuerance and to cause them to embrace the doctrine of the prophet after his death which in his life they had contemned in like manner at the establishing of the gospel in the new testament it pleased christ to raise vp moses and elijah and to make them knowne to his disciples by extraordinarie reuelation that they might beleeue that the doctrine which hee preached was not newe but the same in substance with that which was recorded in the law and the prophets both which were represented by moses and elijah so also he wrought the miracle vpon lazarus the widowes son and lairus daughter thereby to sliewe the power of his godhead the truth of his calling the testimonie of his doctrine lastly to make knowne the power of his resurrection he caused some to rise and appeare to others when he himselfe rose againe but out of these two times we haue neither warrant nor example that god suffered the dead to be raised vp wherefore those instances will not any way confirme samuels appearing which indeed was not true but counterfeite and forged by the deuill himselfe now for the second opinion of those which denie that there be any witches and thereupon hold that this was a meere cosenage of the witch suborning some man or woman to couterfeit the forme attire and voice of samuel thereby to delude saul that also is vntrue for he that spake foretolde the ruine of saul of his sonnes and of his armie yes the time also wherein this was to come to passe whereas in likelihood no man or woman in all israel could haue foretold such things before hand of themselues it was not then any cosenage as is affirmed but a thing effected by the deuill framing to himselfe a bodie in the likenesse of samuel wherein he spake if therefore it be manifest that by counterfeit apparitions of the dead witches and sorcerers can foretell things to come hence sundrie points of witchcraft may be obserued first that there is a league between the witch and the deuill for this was the cause which mooued saul to seeke to witches because neither he himselfe nor any of his servant could raise vp satan in samuels likenesse as the witch of endor did but saul beeing a king might haue commanded helpe from all the wise and learned man in israel for the effecting of such a matter why then would he rather seeke to a silly woman then to them the reason was because shee had made a compact with the devil for the vsing of his helpe at her de aund by vertue whereof he was as readie to answer as she to call him whereas saul and the learned iewes hauing made no such league neither he by his power nor they by their skill could haue performed such a worke secondly the deuill will be readie at the call and command of witches and sorcerers when they are intending any mischiefe for here the witch of endor no sooner spake but he appeared and therefore the text giues her a name that signifieth one hauing rule and command ouer pytho that is the familiar spirit yet when he is commanded he yeelds not vpon constraint but voluntarily because he builds vpon his owne greater aduantage the gaining of the soule of the witch where by the way let it be obserued what a pretious thing the soule of man is the purchasing wherof can make the proud spirit of satan so farre to abase it self as to be at the command of a silly woman againe what an inueterate malice satan beareth to man which for the gaining of a soule will doe that which is so contrarie to his nature it may teach man what to esteeme of his soule and not to sell it for so base a price thirdly by this the great power of the deuill in the behalfe of the sorcerer is made manifest for he was presently at hand to counterfeit samuel and did it so liuely and cunningly as well in forme of bodie as in attire and voice that saul thought verily it was the prophet which may be a caueat vnto vs not easily to giue credit to any such apparitions for though they seeme neuer so true and euident yet such is the power and skill of the deuill that he can quite deceiue vs as he did saul in this place hitherto i haue shewed the first kind of diuination by meanes both true and forged now followeth the second practised without meanes diuination without meanes is the foretelling and reuealing of things to come by the alone and immediate assistance of a familiar spirit this kind is mentioned and expressely forbidden leuit ye shall not regard them that worke with spirits againe leuit if any turne after such as worke with spirits to goe a whoring after them i will set my face against that person and will cut him off from among his people so deut let none be found among you that consulteth with spirits in which places the holy ghost vseth the word ob which more properly signifieth a spirit or deuill in which sense it is taken in leuit and in sam and by reason of the league which is betweene the witch and the deuill the same is also giuen to the witch that worketh by the deuill and therefore the pythonesse at endor is both called ob sam and shee that ruleth ob v now this kind of diuination is practised two wayes either inwardly when the spirit is within the witch or outwardly when being forth of the witch he doth onely inspire him or her an example of the former waie the scripture affordeth act of a woman at philippi that had a spirit of pytho which gather master much vantage with diuining and this spirit whereby she diuined was within her for paul beeing molested said to the spirit i comand thee in the name of iesus christ that thou come out of her and he came out the same houre v and because the deuill is wont in this kinde to speake out of the throat and brest or bellie of the witch p ssessed hereunto learned man haue thought that this name ob is giuen to the deuill because he speaketh out of the witch as out of a bottell or hollow vessell for so the word ob properly signifieth secondly this may be practised when the deuill is forth of the witch and then he either inspireth her or els casteth her into a traunce and therein reueileth vnto her such things as she would know of this kind though we haue no example in scripture yet the history of the heathen doe affoard vnto vs many instances of experience therein one of the principall is the historie of the ten sibylles of greece who were most famous witches and did prophesie of many things to come whereof some were true concerning christ and his kingdome which the deuill stole out of the bible and some other were false and all of them they receiued by reuelation from the deuill in traunces but it will be said if the deuill reueileth vnto his instruments strage things in traunces then how shall a man discerne betweene diabolicall reuelations and the true gift of prophesie which god in traunces reueileth vnto his prophets answer in this point satan is as it were god ape for as he in old time raised vp holy prophets to speake vnto the fathers for the building vp of his church so hath satan inspired his ministers and furnished his instruments with propheticall inspirations from time to time for the building vp of his owne kingdome and hereupon he hath notably counterfeited the true gift of prophecie receiued first from god himselfe and yet though in many things they be like there is great difference betweene them first diuine trances may come vpon god children either whe the soule remaineth vnited with the bodie or else when it is seuered for a time so much paul insinuateth when he faith of himselfe corinthian that he was rapt vp as it were in a heauenly trance into the third heauen but whether in the bodie or out of the bodie he knew not but in all diabolical ecstasies though the body and senses of the witch be as it were bound or benummed for the time yet their soules still ren aine vnited to their body and not seuered from them for though the deuill by god permission may kill the bodie and so take the soule out of it for euer yet to take it from the bodie for a time and to reunite them againe is miraculous and therefore beyond the compasse of his power secondly in diuine trances the servant of god haue all their senses yes all the powers of soule and bodie remaining sound and perfect onely for a time the actions and operations are suspended and cease to doe their dutie but in ecstasies that be from satan his instruments are cast into frenzies and madnesse so as reason in them is darkened vnderstanding obscured memorie weakned the braine distempered yes all the faculties are so blemished that many of them neuer recouer their former estate againe and they that scape best doe carrie their blemishes as the deuills skars euen vnto their graue so kind is saran to his friends that he will leaue his tokens behind him where euer he comes in this sort the servant of god receiue no such blemishes but rather a further good and a greater measure of illumination of all the powers of the soule thirdly diuine ecstasies tend alway to the confirming of the truth of the gospel and the furtherance of true religion and pietie such was peters act which serued to assure him of his calling to preach the gospel to the gentiles and to informe his iudgement in this truth that there was no acception of persons with god and that to them of the new testament all things were cleane and nothing polluted but the scope of them that are from satan is principally the suppressing and hinderance of religion the drawing of the weake into errours the ratifying and confirming of the that are fallen thereinto and the generall vpholding of the practises of vngodlinesse and by these and such like particular differences hath god pulled off the deuills vizar and made him better knowne and discerned of true christians and thus much concerning diuination the first part of witch craft the second part is that which consisteth in operation and is therefore called operatiue or working witchcraft witch craft in operation is that which is employed in the practise and reall working of strange things or wonders and it hath two parts inchantment and iugling inchantment is the working of wonders by a charme this the lord expressely forbiddeth deuter let none be found among you that is a charmer in this description two points are to be considered what things may be done by inchantment namely wonders for i say it is the practise of wonders by what means these woders are wrought that is by a charme for the first the wonders done by inchanters are the raising of stormes and tempests windes and weather by sea and by land the poysoning of the ayre blasting of corne killing of cattell and annoying of man woman amp children the procuring of strange passions and torments in mens body and other creatures with the curing of the same casting out of deuills these and such like things inchanters can doe by their charmes and for proofe hereof we haue the vniforme consent of all ages with the records of witches confessions to manifest the same besides the testimonie of experience in this age so as the man that calles it into question may as well doubt of the sun shining at noone day yet for the further declaration thereof we will alledge what the scripture saith in this point salomon saith if the serpent bite when he is not charmed no better is a babler ecclesiastes thus the words are in our english translation but they may better be thus read according to the originall if the serpent bite before he be charmed what profit hath the master of the tongue thereby that is the charmer and so they beard this sense if the inchanter be bitten before the serpent be charmed then he hath no benefit by his charme for salomon in that place giueth vs to vnderstand what power in hanters haue and what they may doe by their charmes if they come in time namely stay the poyson of the serpent so as he cannot hint either by biting or stinging when balae intended euill against israel he hired balaam to curse them number now this balaam was an inchanting witch for though he be called a prophet yet this was onely in the reputation of the world for his practise was to inehant by charmes of words and to that purpose he was hired to curse god people that is to bring mischiefe vpon them by charming which thing he had often and inany to doe but that it pleased god contrary to his endea ours out into these words there is no sorcerie against iacob nor soothsaying against israel number as if he should haue said i know well that sorcerie is powerfull in many things and of force to bring much mischiefe vpon man yet it can take no place against the people of god because he hath blessed them and whom he blesseth them no man can hurt by cursing inchanters therefore may vpon god permission worke strange things as appeares by these places to name no more the second point to be obserued is the meanes whereby these wonders are practised these are counterfeit and supposed meanes not ordained and sanctified by god which are commonly called charmes a charme is a spell or verse consisting of strange words vsed as a signe or watchword to the devil to cause him to worke wonders first i say it is a spell consisting of strange words because in these inchantments certaine words or verses are secretly vttered which in regard of the common formes of words are strange and wherein there is thought to be a miraculous efficacie to bring some extraordinarie and vnexpected thing to passe a point of it selfe euident and needing no further proofe considering it is not vnknowne to the more ignorant sort who are better acquainted with these then with the word of god and these words are not all of one and the same kind but some are rude and barbarous neither knowne nor conceiued or vnderstood of which the auncienter sort of charmes were wont to be made especially and some later some againe are plaine and knowne tearmes which may be vnderstoode as the names of the trinitie some words and sentences of scripture as in principto er at verbum ampc againe charmes that consist of words are not all of one sort but some be imprecations wishing some euill others in shewe haue the forme of praises and blessings whereby the witch either flatteringly commendeth or fauourably wisheth some good others againe are made in forme of prayer and petition and they all are sometimes plainely conceiued sometimes in ruder and more vnknowne words as those well know who haue heard them or reade them where they are to be sound secondly i adde that the charme is vsed for a sign and watchword to the deuill to cause him to worke wonders wherein standeth the nature and proper end of a charme the nature in that it is a diabolicall signe the end to cause the deuill to worke a wonder whereby it is distinguished from all other speeches of man for all they commonly carrie the nature of the thing whereof and whereabout they be made but the charme doth not alwaies follow the nature of the words but hath another nature in regard of the immediate relation it hath to the deuill to whome it is a signe againe the charme pronounced doth not the wonder but the devil admonished by it as by the watchword to doe the feate now because some are of opinion in regard of the ordinarie production of strange effects by these meanes that the spell hath in selfe some vertuit and power to such and such purposes whereinto it is vsed i will stand a little in the proofe of the contrarie that a charme is onely a diabolicall watchword and hath in it selfe no such effectuall power or possibilitie to worke a wonder my reasons are these first this must be taken for a maine ground that as there is nothing in the world that hath beeing but from god so nothing hath in it any efficacie but by his ordinance now whatsoeuer efficacie is in any creature from god it receiued the same into it selfe either by creation or since the creation by some newe and speciall institution appointmet and gift of god for example the bread in the saerament by a naturall power giuen vnto it in the creation serueth to nourish the bodie and the same bread by god speciall appointment in his word feedes the soule in that by his ordinance it is made to vs a signe and seale of the bodie of christ broken for vs and so it is in euerie creature if the effect be ordinarie and naturall it hath it by creation if extraordinarie and supernaturall it hath that by diuine ordination so that whatsoeuer comes to passe by any other meanes is by satanicall operation now charmes and spells standing of set words and sillables haue no power in them to worke wonders either by the gift of nature in the creation or by god appointment since the creation and therfore they haue in them no power at all for any such purpose this latter part of the reason beeing the assumption or application of the ground to the present instance consisteth of two parts which i will prooue in order first then i affirme that by the gift of nature no words of charmes haue power in the to worke wonders amp i prooue it in this manner i all words made and vttered by man are in their own nature but sounds framed by the tongue of the breath that commeth from the lungs and that which is onely a bare sound in all reason can haue no vertue in it to cause a reall worke much lesse to produce a wonder the sounds of bells and of many musicall instruments and the voices of many bruit creatures are fartr more strong and powerfull then the voice of a man yet who knoweth not that none of all these is auaileable to such purposes indeede they haue power to affect the minde by their sweetnes or otherwise but they are not able to bring to passe a reall worke either by the inflicting of hurts and harmes or by the procuring of good i conclude therefore that the voice of man by nature hath no power to worke any wonders ii againe euery thing which hurteth or affecteth another must necessarily touch the thing which it hurteth or affecteth for it is a graunted rule in nature that euery agent worketh vpon the patient by touching but words vttered in charmes are commonly made of things absent and therefore though it should be graunted that they had the power of touching a substance which they cannot haue yet of theselues they are not auaileable to bring vpon things absent either good or euill iii moreouer if words conceiued in charmes and spells haue any such power as is pretended why should not euery word that any man speaketh haue the same power inasmuch as all words are of the same nature beeing onely sounds framed in the breast and vttered by the tongue in letters and syllables but experience teacheth that the same word spoken by another hath not the same vertue for the charme vttered by the charmer himselfe will take effect but beeing spoken in the same manner by another man that is no inchanter maketh to no purpose for nothing is effected by it iv that which is in nature nothing but a ba e signification cannot serue to worke a wonder and this is the nature of all words for as they be framed of mans breath they are naturall but yet in regard of forme and articulation they are artificiall and significant and the vse of them in euery language is to signifie that which the author thereof intended for the first significations of words depe d vpon the will and pleasure of man that framed and inuented them beeing therefore inuented onely to shew or signifie some thing it remaines that neither in nature nor proper vse they can be applied to the producing of wounderfull and strange effects thus the former part of the assumption is cleared in the second place i affirme that the words of charmers haue not this power in them by any speciall gift blessing or appoyntment of god since the creation which is the other part of the assumption and i shew it thus whatsoeuer is powerfull and effectual to any end or purpose by god gift blessing or appointment the same is commanded in his word to be vsed and hath also a promise of blessing annexed to the right vse therof to vse the instance before made for explanation sake the bread in the lord supper hath this power and propertie giuen it by christ to seale amp signifie vnto euery beleeuing receiuer the bodie of christ and by this propertie giuen it it is a eileable to this purpose though it be a thing aboue the common and naturall vse of bread amp thereupon we haue warrant from christs owne commandement ordinance and example so to vse it but in the whole bodie of the scripture there is not the like commandement to vse the words of charmes for the effecting of wonders much lesse the like promise of blessing vpon the same so vsed therefore the conclusion is that god hath giuen no such power vnto them in speciall if it be asked then what they are and whereto they serue i ansvver they are no better then the deuills sacraments and vvatchvvords to cause him to doe some strange vvorke for the inchanter hath relation in his minde to the devil vvhose helpe he hath at hand by couenant either open or secret or at least some superstitious opinion of the force of the vvords vvhich is a preparation to a couenant the truth of this doctrine hovvsoeuer it be thus made manifest yet it findes not generall intertainement at all mens hands for there are and haue beene some learned man in all ages who maintained the contrarie both by word and writing and namely that there is great vertue amp power in words pronounced in time and place to effect strange things for proofe wherof they alledge these reasons first that the bare conceit and imagination of man is of great force to doe strange things and therefore words expressed much more ans the ground of the reason is naught imagination is nothing els but a strong conceit of the minde touching any thing whatsoeuer it be and by reason of the communion that is betweene the bodie and soule being together it is of great force to work within the man that imagineth diuersely and to cause alteration in himselfe which may tend either to the hurt or to the good of his owne bodie but yet imagination hath no force out of a man to affect or hurt an other a man conceiuing desperately of his owne estate by the strength of imagination may kill himselfe but the same conceit be it neuer to strong can not hurt his neighbour for it is no more then cesars image vpon his coyne which serueth onely to represent cesar so imagination is nothing but the representation of some thing in the minde by conceit and therefore as the person of cesar is nothing hurt though his image be defaced so when we conceiue of man in our mindes though neuer so badly and malitiously yet all is of no force to hurt or annoy them either in person or state secondly they alleage that witches by malitious and wrie lookes in anger and displeasure may and do hurt those vpon whom they looke whether they be man or other creatures and it is an old receiued opinion that in malitious and ill disposed persons there proceed out of the eye with the beams noysome and malignant spirits which infect the ayre and doe poison or kill not onely them with whome they are daily conuersant but others also whose company they frequent of what age strength and complexion so euer they be ans but the opinion is as fond as it is old for it is as much against nature that such vertue should proceede out of the eye or such spirits breake out of the nerves to the partie hated as it is for the blood of the bodie of it selfe to gush out of the veines yet for the ratifying of this opinion they alleadge that which is written in gen where iacob laide spe kled oddes before the sheepe in their watering troughes amp that by god appointment for this ende that they might bring forth partie coloured lambs i answer that was not a worke of sight but a speciall and ex raordinarie worke of god prouidence vpon iacob in his necessitie as we may plainely see in the chapter next following v amp yes it was taught iacob by god himselfe and f it had been an ordinarie work doubtlesse the ga es thereof beeing so good iacob would haue done it againe afterward but we neuer read that he did it againe and be it granted it were a naturall worke yet it cannot prooue witching by sight because the sheepe receiued into their eyes the species and resemblance of the rodds which is according to nature whereas in fas ination or bewitching by sight malignant spirits should not be receiued in but sent forth of the eye which is against nature yes but the basiliske or cockatrice doth kill man and beast with his breath and sight yes the wolfe takes away the voyce of such as he suddenly meetes withall and beholds and why may not wicked man or woman doe the like an indeede it is a thing receiued by common errour and held of some for a truth but no experience of any man hath yet beene brought for the proofe thereof and therefore it is to be reputed as fabulous thus much in probabilitie may be thought if the allegatio should be true that the basilis e beeing possessed of a thicke poyson may by his breath send forth some grosse venemo s vapours and thereby infect the ayre and poison the thing that is neere vnto him and that the soddaine and vnexpected beholding of the venemous cock trice or the ravenous wolfe beeing creatures in their kind fearefull especi ll to those that are not acquainted with them may cause present astonishment and consequently perill of death but that this should be done by the ei s of these creatures only in maner aforesaid it is not credible and therefore a thors haue vpon good ground denied i as beeing confirmed neither by reason nor experience thirdly they reason thus nchanters by whispering of words in charmes can stay the stinging and poisoning of serpents for so dauid in effect speaketh that the voice of the charmer charmeth the serpent psalm it may seeme therefore that there is no small force in words for the effecting of strange works ans it must be granted that the charmer may inchant the serpent but how not by vertue of the words in the charme but by the power of the deuill who then is stirred vp when the charme is repeated to doe the thing intended the truth of this answer appeares by the words of the text as they are read in the originall that the inchanter ioyneth societies very cunningly namely with the deuill now these s ci ties betweene satan and the charmer are the very ground of the worke vpon the serpent which worke vpon confederacie formerly made is done by the deuill and the words of the charme are no more but the inchanters item or watchword to occasion him thereunto and let any other man reapeat the same words a thousand times that either is not thus confederate with satan or hath not a superstitious opinion of charmes and al his labour will be in vaine fourthly the word of god is of great force in the hearts of man to con ert and change them as it is vttered by the mouth of mortall man and this force is not in the man by whom it is spoken where then should it be but in the and if in the words why may not other words be of like beeing vttered by man ans the power of god word comme not from this that it is a word and barely vttered out of the mouth of a man for so it is a d ad letter but it proceedeth from the powerfull operation of the spirit annexed by god promise thereunto when it is vttered read and conceiued which operation if it were taken away the word might be preached a thousand yeares together without any fruit or effect either to saluation or condemnation the word of god is powerfull by the concurrence of the worke of the spirit not in all things as for example in raising winds and tempests in infecting the ayre in killing and annoying man or other creatures but in the conuersion of sinners in gathering the elect and in confirming those that be called and this power it hath also by his speciall blessing and appointment furthermore the same word is not of power when it is barely read heard or spoken vnlesse it be also conceiued in the vnderstanding receiued with reuerence treasured vp in the memorie and mingled with faith in the heart whereas the bare reading and muttering ouer the words of a charme by an inchanter though in an vnknowne to gue in ude and barbarous words is sufficient to procure the working of wonders now though the word of god be in it selfe pure and serue to excellent purpose as hath beene saide yet by the way we may remember that as it is with all things that are most pretious nothing is so excellent in it kind which may not be abused so it is with this heauenly word for it is and may be made a charme two waies first when some part of it is indeede vsed for a charme thus many texts of scripture both in latin and other languages haue beene abused by inchanters as might easily be shewed secondly when it is heard read recited or made a matter of praier without vnderstanding and thus the ignorant man as much as in him lyeth makes it a charme for in his ordinarie vse thereof he neither conceiueth nor taketh care to vnderstand it as lamentable experience teacheth yet in neither of these is the very bare repeating of the word effectuall for as when a man heares or reades it vnlesse the spirit of god inlighteneth his heart it is to no purpose so when it is made the matter of a spell nothing will be effected vnlesse the deuill either by conf deracie or superstitious conceit be drawne to conferre his helpe in the point for his owne aduantage howbeit of all inchantments these are the most dishonorable to god most acceptable to satan and most hurtfull to the charmer which are made of the scriptures for beside the sinne of witchcraft in the charming this inconuenience that satan procureth more credite to one of th se then to twentie other because the words are scripture hereby clo ing his mischie ous practises vnder the colour of holynes and so confirming the truth of that which the holy ghost saith that when he worketh most deceitfully he transformes himselfe into an angell of l hgt corinthian he knoweth well that ordinarie words seeme nothing to some man therfore he teacheth and suggesteth phrases and sentences out of the word for such vngodly ends that euen the grace of them fet hed from the scriptures may make them s mefull wherefore let euery one that is indued with grace and knowledge d ely consider this with himselfe cannot god word be effectuall when it is vsed to edification vnlesse the worke of his owne spirit accompany the same then surely it is impossible that the same which is holy beeing vsed to an euill ende should be powerfull except the deuill affordeth his helpe for the effecting thereof to conclude therefore let man say what they will the truth is this that words of inchantment be they neuer so holy or prophane either by way of cursing or blessing haue no power of themselues to the producing of strange workes but are as hath beene said onely diabolicall signes admonishing the deuill of some wickednes intended and desired which he through his power must cause to be done and thus much of inchantment standing vpon the practise of wonders by a charme to this head of inchantment sundry other practises of witches are to be referred the chiefe whereof are these first the vsing and making of characters images or figures specially the framing of circles for this end to work wonders by them as to draw the picture of a child or ma or other creature in clay or waxe and to burie the same in the ground or to hide it in some secret place or to burn it in the fire therby intending to hurt or kill the partie resembled againe to make an impression into the saide picture by pricking or gashing the heart or any other place with intent to procure dangerous or deadly pains to the same parts this is a meere practise of inchantment amp the making of the image and vsing of it to this end is in vertue a charme though no words be vsed for the bare picture hath no more power of it selfe to hurt the bodie represented then bare words all that is done commeth by the worke of the deuill who alone by the vsing of the picture in that sort is occasioned so or so to worke the parties destruction secondly hither we may referre the vsing of amulets that is remedies and preseruatiues against inchantments orceries and bewitchings made of herbes or some such things and hanged about the necke for that ende thirdly the vsing of exorcismes that is certaine set formes of words vsed in way of ad uration for some extraordinarie ende a practise vsuall in the church of rome whereby the priest co iures the salt holy water creame pittle oyle pal es ampc all which are in truth meere inchantements for howsoeuer the councell of trent hath ratified the by their decrees amp so commended them to general vse within the compasse of the popish church yet they haue in them no power or abili ie of blessing or cursing either by nature or god appoyntment fourthly in this number we reckon the vsing of the name iesus to d iue away the deuill or to p euent witchcraft a common practise among the ignorant wherein the wonderfull malice of satan bew aies it selfe in making the ignorant people thinke that christ is a coniurer and that there is vertue in the naming o his name to doe some strange thing whereas the truth is he careth neither for this name nor for all the names of god if a man goes no further the the bare repeating of them but rather delighteth to see them so abused and disgraced and hereupon it is that in all coniurations when he is raised by the sorcerer he is willing to be adi red by all the holy names of god that are in the scripture to the ende that he may the more deepely seduce his owne instruments and make them to thinke that these holy names will bind him amp force him to yeeld vnto their desires in the particular when indeede there is no such matter which point throughly considered may admonish vs to take speciall heede of these cunning glozes and deuillish insinuations whereby he intendeth to delude vs alway remembring that the apostles themselues to whom the power of working miracles was giuen did neuer acknowledge the worke to be done by the name of iesus but as s peter affirmeth through faith in his name act fiftly the crossing of the bodie to this ende that we may be blessed from the deuill a thing vsuall euen of latter times specially in popery wherein the crosse carrieth the very nature of a charme and the vse of it in this maner a practise of inchantment for god hath giuen no such vertue to a crosse either by creation or speciall priuiledge and appointment six ly the scratching f a witch to discouer the witch for it is a means which hath no warrant or power thereunto either by the word of god or fro nature but onely from the deuill who if he yeeldeth either at crossing or scrat hing he doth it willingly and not by compulsion that he may feede his instrument with a false faith and a superstitious coceit to the dishonor of god and their owne ouerthrowe in a word looke whatsoeuer actions gestures signes rites and ceremonies are vsed by man or woman to worke wonders hauing no power to effect the same either by creation and nature or by speciall appointment from god they must all be referred to this head and reckoned for charmes the vse now considering that all kinds of charmes are the deuills watchwords to cause him to worke the wonder and haue no vertue in them be the words wherein they are conceiued neuer so good hereby we must be admo shed to take heede of the vse of them and all other vnlawful ceremonies both in respect of their formes be they praises or praiers or imprecations as also in regard of their endes be they neuer so good in outward appearance but alas the more lamentable is the case charming is in as great request as physicke and charmers more sought vnto then physicians in time of neede there be charmes for all conditions and ages of man for diverse kinds of creatures yes for euery disease as for head ach tooth ach stitches and such like neuerthelesse howsoeuer some haue subiected themselues to such base and vngodly meanes yet the vse hereof by the mercie of god hath not beene vniuersall and those that haue sought for helpe are to be aduised in the feare of god to repent of this their sinne and to take a better course let them rightly consider that they haue hither to depended vpon satan for helpe and consequently haue dishonoured god and renounced lawful meanes sanctified by him which should not haue beene done in case of the greatest worldly gaine for no man may doe euill that good may come of it but they that vse the helpe of charmers and consult with wisemen are wont to alleadge something in defence or excuse of their practise first that they for their part meane no hurt they know no euill by the man whome they seeke to they onely send to him and he does them good how and in what manner they regard not ans indeed many be ignorant of the inchanters courses but in cases of losse and hindrance man ought not onely to inquire the meanes but to waigh and consider the warrantablenes thereof otherwise they doe not that they doe of faith and so are guiltie of sinne before god rom last verse put the case they themselues meane no hurt yet in this action they doe hurt to themselues by reposing trust in things which vpon better consideration they shall finde to be dishonourable and therefore hatefull to god secondly they alledge we goe to the physician for counsell we take his recipe but we know not what it meaneth yet we vse it and finde benefite if this be lawful why may we not as well take benefit by the wiseman whose courses we be ignorant of ans physick vsed in time and place is a worthy ordinance of god and therefore beeing rightly vsed god giues his blessing to it but for inchantment it was neuer sanctified by god and therefore cannot be vsed in any assurance of his blessing the physicians receit being a composition and mixture of naturall things though a man knowes it not yet he takes it into his stomake or applies it to his bodie and sensibly perceiues the vertue and eff cacie thereof in the working whereas the charmers course consisteth of words which neither are knowne in themselues nor are manifest in their vse to sense or vnderstanding and hereby it is plaine there is not the same reason of physicke and charmes the one hauing a sensible operation by vertue giuen it of god the other insensible and wrought aboue ordinaric meanes by the worke of satan thirdly they alleadge god is mercifull and he hath prouided a salue for euery sore they haue vsed other means but they haue not succeeded and what should they doe more may they not in extremitie repaire to the inchaunter and see what he can doe for them rather then their goods and cattell should be lost and spoyled ans it were better for you to bide by the losse yes to liue and die in any sickenes then to tempt god by seeking help at charmers hands for their helpe is dangerous and commeth from the deuill whereupon if ye rest your selues ye ioyne league with him and so hazzard eternally the safetie both of body and soules vse good meanes allowed of god and when they haue beene vsed often without successe proceede not to other courses but referre your selues to god and say with iob the lord hath giuen and the lord hath taken away blassed be the name of the lord iob and thus much of inchanting the first part of operatiue witchcraft the second part is iugling iugling is the deluding of the eye with some strange sleight done aboue the or linar e course of nature in this description there are two points necessarily required in the point of iugling delusion of the eye and extraordinarie sleight delusion is then performed when a man is made to thinke he sees that which indeede he sees not and this is done by the operation of the deuill diuersly but especially three waies first by corrupting the humour of the eye which is the next instrument of sight secondly by altering the ayre which is the meane by which the obiect or species is carried to the eye thirdly by altering and changing the obiect that is the thing seene or whereon a man looketh this deluding of the sense is noted by paul gal o foolish gal tians who hath bewitched you where the spirit of god eth a word borrowed from this kind of sorcerers which in full meaning signifieth thus much who hath deluded your eyes and caused you to thinke you see that which you see not as if he should haue said looke as the iugler by his deuillish article deludeth the outward eye and maketh man thinke they see that which indeede they doe not euen so the false apostles by their erroneous doctrine haue deluded the eies of your minds and haue caused you galatians to iudge that to be the word of god which is not and that to be truth which is error and falshood paul giues vs to vnderstand by the very phrase vsed that there is such a kind of iugling as is able to deceiue the eye for otherwise his comparison would not hold the second thing required in iugling is a sleight done aboue the order and course of nature this is the point which maketh those conueiances to be witchcraft for if they were within the compasse of nature they could not be rightly earmed and reputed sorceries considering that diverse man by reason of the agilitie of their body amp sleight of their hands are able to worke diverse feats which seeme strange to the beholders and yet not meddle with witchcraft againe some by the lawful article of the optiks may shew strange amp admirable things by meanes of light and darknesso and yet may be free from impution of magicall worke because they keepe themselues wholly within the power and practise of nature but sleights done ouer and aboue delusio must passe the ordinarie bounds and precincts of nature and so are made points of witchcraft one memorable example for the clearer manifestation of this point we haue in the scripture by name in the and chapters of exodus where moses and aaron wrought wonders before pharaoh turning the rodde into a serpent and water into blood with many other such like now iannes and iambres for so paul calleth them tim the magicians of egypt did worke the same miracles which moses and aaron had done but here was the difference moses made true creatures and wrought true miracles whereas they did all in appearance and outward shew for theirs were not true reall actions but onely magicall illusions wrought by the sleight amp subtilty of the devil in the practise of lugling and because some thinke that the serpents and froggs caused by the magitians were true creatures and all their other workes as really and truely done as those which moses and aaron did i will here stand a little to shewe and prooue the contrarie that they were onely in shew and appearance and not in deede and truth first then if the frogs and serpents caused by iannes and iambres were true creatures indeede and their other sleights true and reall works then they were made and caused either by the deuill or by god himselfe for no man of himselfe can make a rod to become a true serpent but this was done neither by the deuill nor by god as shall appea e in the sequel they were not done by the deuill because the deuill cannot make a true creature either serpent or frogge hovv doth that appeare ans to make a true creature of any sort by producing the same out of the causes is a vvork seruing to continue the creation and is indeede a kinde of creation now the deuill as he cannot create a thing at the first so he is not able to continue the same by a new creation that beeing a propertie belonging to god onely for better conceiuing hereof we must know that god crea eth two waies either primarily in the beginning whe he made all things of nothing gen or secodarily in the gouernment of the world when he produceth a true creature in a true miracle yet not making it of nothing as he did in the beginning but producing it by ministring and in forming the matter immediately by himselfe without the aide of ordinarie meanes and instruments appointed after the creation the former is creation properly called the latter a continuance thereof both these god hath reserued to himselfe as incommunicable to any creature as for the succession and propagation of creatures in their kinds as of man beast birds fish ampc it is onely a continuation of the creatures in their kindes and is wrought by ordinarie meanes of generation but is no continuance of the worke of creation and the deuill by his power may make counterfeits of the true creatures of god but neither by creating them nor by continuing their creation these two beeing workes peculiar and proper to the deitie alone againe if the deuill could turne a rodde into a true serpent and water into blood indeed then his power should be equall to the power of the son of god himselfe for the first miracle that he wrought was the turning of water into wine loh and that was no greater a worke then the turning of water into blood or a rod into a serpent but this were most horrible blasphemic to match the deuill with the son of god and his finite power with the power of the godhead by which miracles are wrought and the truth is satan can worke no true miracles neither doth the text import that the magicians did that which they did by miracle but by inchantment and sorcerie exod amp in the second place i affirme that god did not create these creatures or cause the works of the magicians to be effected and this is prooued by the words of paul tim who saith that iannes and iambres which did these workes withstood moses and aaron whom god had sent and by whom he wrought if then god had wrought with the magicians also he should haue beene against himselfe yes he should haue wrought both waies for himselfe and against himselfe and consequently should haue impeached his ovvne glorie for the manifestation vvhereof he wrought miracles by moses and aaron which vve may not once thinke of god seeing therefore that these serpents if they were true creatures were not created either by satan because he could not or by god himselfe because he would not it must needes remaine that they amp all other the magicians works were meere illusions amp not otherwise yet for the further clearing of the matter in hand the text it selfe yeeldeth sundrie reasons to prooue that these acts of the sorcerers were but appearances and not things really produced first they that ca not do a less thing can not possibly do a greater now moses shewes that the egyptian inchaters could not do a less thing then the turning of rodds into true serpents or water into blood for they could not by all their power amp skill preserue themselues from the plagues of egypt as the botch amp other iudgements exod which was a more easie thing then to make or change a creature nay they were not able to bring forth lice by their inchantment which seemed to be the least miracle but acknowledged that to be the inger of god ex secondly the text saith that aarons serpent deuoured their serpents exod v hence it followeth that theirs could not be true creatures for in all likelihood they were all of the same kind and of like quantitie at least in shew and it was neuer seene that one creature should receiue into it selfe an other creature of equall bignesse with preseruation of it selfe neither hath it been obserued ordinarily that one creature shold deuoure another of the same kind it was therefore a worke of god secret power in the true serpent wherby he would shew that the other were not true and real but formall amp imaginarie thirdly if the magicians had beene able to haue made true frogges and serpents then by the same power they might have remooued those which moses brought for the like abilitie is required in both yet this they could not doe but were faine to intreat moses to pray for their remooueall so saith the text then pharaoh called for moses and aaron and said pray ampc exod lastly the frogges which moses caused when they were remooued beeing gathered on eapes caused great corruption and the whole land stanke of them exod againe the water turned into blood made the fish in the river to die and the water to stinko so that the egyptians could not drinke of the water of the river exod but we read of no such effect of the frogges and water of the inchanters which doubtlesse would haue followed as well as the other if both had beene true and reall creatures it remaines therefore that these were but meere appearances and iugling trickes and the sorcerers themselues iuglers yes all their works but sleights caused by the power and subtiltie of satan and no true works as hath beene said thus i haue declared the whole nature grounds and kinds of this damnable article hauing in the former part of this treatise opened the nature of witchcraft and thereby made way for the better vnderstading of this iudiciall lawe of moses i come now to shew who is the practiser hereof whome the text principally aimeth at namely the witch whether man or woman a witch is a magician who either by open or secret league wittingly and willingly consenteth to vse the aide and assistance of the deuill in the working of wonders first i call the witch a magician to shew what kind of person this is to wit such a one as doth professe and practise witchcraft for a magician is a professor and practiser of this arte as may appeare act where simon a witch of samaria is called magus or simon the magician againe in this generall tearme i comprehend both sexes or kindes of persons man and woman excluding neither from beeing witches a point the rather to be remembred because moses in this place setting downe a iudiciall awe against witches vseth a word of the feminine gender ecasbephah which in english properly signisieth a woman wicth whereupon some might gather that woman onely were witches howbeit moses in this word exempteth not the male but onely vseth a notion referring to the female for good causes principally for these two first to giue vs to vnderstand that the woman beeing the weaker sexe is sooner intangled by the deuills illusions with this damnable article then the man and in all ages it is found true by experience that the deuill hath more easily and oftner preuailed with woman then with man hence it was that the hebrues of ancient times vsed it for a prouerb the more woman the more witches his first temptation in the beginning was with eue a woman and since he pursueth his practise accordingly as making most for his aduantage for where he findeth easiest entrance and best entertainement thither will he oftnest resert secondly to take away all exception of punishment from any partie that shall practise this trade and to shewe that weaknes canot exempt the witch from death for in all reason if any might alledge insirmitie and plead for fauour it were the woman who is weaker then the man but the lord saith if any person of either sexe among his people be found to haue entred couenant with satan and become a practiser of sorcerie though it be a woman and the weaker vessell shee shall not escape she shall not be suffred to liue she must die the death and though weakenes in other cases may lessen both the crime and the punishment yet in this it shall take no place the second point in the description is consenting to vse the helpe of the deuill either by open or secret league wittingly and willingly wherein standeth the very thing that maketh a witch to be a witch the yeelding of consent vpon couenaut by which clause two sorts of people are expressely excluded from being witches first such as be tainted with phrenzy or madnes or are through weakenesse of the braine deluded by the deuill for these though they may be said after a sort to haue societie with satan or rather he with them yet they cannot giue their consent to vse his aide truely but onely in imagination with the true witch it is farre otherwise secondly all such superstitious persons man or woman as vse charmes and inchantment for the effecting of any thing vpon a superstitious and erroneous perswasion that the charmes haue vertue in them to doe such things not knowing that it is the action of the deuill by those meanes but thinking that god hath put vertue into them as hee hath done into hearbs for physicke of such persons we gue no doubt abundance in this our land who though they deale wickedly and sinne grieuously in vsing charmes yet because they intend not to ioyne league with the deuill either secretly or formally they are not to be counted witches neuertheles they are to be aduertis d in the meane time that their estate is fearefull for their present vngodly practises haue prepared them already to this cursed trade and may bring them in time to be the ranckest witches that can be wherefore i aduise all ignorant persons that know not god nor the scriptures to take heede and beware of this dangerous euill the vse of charmes for if they be once conuinced in their consciences and knowe that god hath giuen no power to such meanes and yet shall vse them assuredly they doe in effect consent to the deuill to be helped by him and thereupon are ioyned in confederacie with him in the confidence of their owne hearts and so are become witches the third and last thing in the description is the end of witchcraft the w rking of woders woders are wrought three wayes as hath beene shewed either by diuination or by inchatment or by lugling and to one of these three heads eates and practises of witchcraft to be referred now if any man doubt whether there b such witches indeede as haue beene escribed let him remember that beside experience in all ages and country wee haue also sundrie examples of them euen in the scriptures in the old testament we read of balaam numb who though he be called a prophet because he was so reputed of man yet indeede he was a notorious witch both by profession and practise and would haue shewed his cunning in that kind vpon the israelits if god had not undered him against his will of the same kinde were the inchanters of egypt exod the witches of persia daniel and the pythonisse of endor known for a renowned sorcerer ouer all israel and therefore sauls servant beeing asked could presently tell of her as we read sam in the new testament mention is made of simon whose name declared his profession his name was magus and the text saith that he vsed witchcraft and bewitched the people of calling himselfe a great man act whence it was that after his death there was a statue set vp in rome in honour of him in the daies of claudius cesar with this inscription simoni deo sancto and it is not vnlike but bar jesus the false prophet at paphus was a man addicted to the practises of witchcraft and for that cause was called by a kinde of excellency elymas the magician act that is the great or famous sorcerer lastly the pythonisse at philippi that gat her master much aduantage by diuining act and all these vsed the helpe of the deuill for the working of wonders of witches there be two sorts the bad witch and the good witch for so they are commonly called the bad witch is he or she that hath consented in league with the deuill to vse his helpe for the doing of hurt onely as to strike and annoy the body of man woman children and cattell with diseases and with death it selfe so likewise to raise tempests by sea and by land ampc this is commonly called the binding witch the good witch is he or shee that by consent in a league with the deuill doth vse his help for the doing of good onely this cannot hurt torment curse or kill but onely heale and cure the hurts inflicted vpon man or cattell by badde witches for as they can doe no good but onely hurt so this can doe no hurt but good onely and this is that order which the deuill hath set in his kingdome appointing to seuerall persons their seuerall offices and charges and the good witch is commonly tearmed the vnbinding witch now howsoeuer both these be euill yet of the two the more horrible amp de stable monster is the good witch for looke in what place soeuer there be any bad witches that hurt onely there also the deuill hath his good ones who are better knowne then the bad beeing comonly called wise man or wise woman this wil appeare by experience in most places in these country for let a mans childe friend or cattell be taken with some sore sicknes or strangely tormented with some rare and vnknowne disease the first thing he doth is to bethink himselfe and inquire after some wiseman or wise woman amp thither he sends and goes for helpe when he comes he first tells him the state of the sicke man the witch then beeing certified of the disease prescribeth either charmes of words to be vsed ouer him or other such counterfeit meanes wherein there is no vertue beeing nothing els but the deuills sacraments to cause him to doe the cure if it come by witchraft well the meanes are receiued applied and vsed the sicke partie accordingly recouereth and the conclusion of all is the vsuall acclamation oh happie is the day that euer i met with such a man or woman to helpe me here obserue that both haue a stroke in this action the bad witch hurt him the good healeth him but the truth is the latter hath done him a thousand fold more harme then the former for the one did onely hurt the bodie but the deuill by meanes of the other though he haue left the bodie in good plight yet he hath laid fast hold on the soule and by curing the body hath killed that and the partie thus cured cannot say with dauid the lord is my helper but the deuill is my helper for by him he is cured of both these kinds of witches the present law of moses must be vnderstood this point well considered yeeldeth matter both of instruction and practise of instruction in that it shewes the cunning and craftie dealing of satan who afficteth and tormenteth the body for the gaine of the soule and for that purpose hath so ordered his instrumets that the bad witch giues the occasion by annoying the body or goods and the good immediatly accomplisheth his desire by intangling the soule in the bands of errour ignorance and false faith againe this sheweth the blindnes of naturall corruption specially in gnorant and superstitious people it is their nature to abhorte hurtfull persos such as bad witches be and to count them execrable but those that doe them good they honour and reuerence as wise man and woman yes secke and vnto the in times of extremitie though of all persons in the world they be most odious and satan in them the greatest friend when he is most like himselfe and intendeth greatest mischiefe let all ignorant persons be aduised hereof in time to take heede to themselues and learne to knowe god and his word that by light from thence they may better discerne of the subtile practises of satan and his instruments for matter of practise hence wee learne our duetie to abhorre the wizzard as the most pernicious enemie of our saluation the most effectuall instrument of destroying our soules and of building vp the deuills kingdome yes as the greatest enemie to god name worship and glorie that is in the world next to satan himselfe of this sort was simon magus who by doing strange cures and workes made the people of samaria to take him for some great man who wrought by the mightie power of god whereas he did all by the deuill he therefore beeing a good witch did more hurt in seducing the people of god then balaam a bad one could with all his curses and we must remember that the lord hath set a lawe vpon the witches head he must not liue and if death be due to any then a thousand death of right belong to the good witch but the patrones of witches indeauour to delude the true interpretation of that lawe for by a witch say they we must vnderstand a poisoner and they alledge for that purpose the interpreters who translate the original word mecashephah by which signifieth a poisoner i answer first the word vsed by the interpreters signifieth indeede so much yet not that onely but also a vvitch in generall as may appeare in sundrie places of scripture the apostle reckoning vp witchcraft among the workes of the flesh vseth the greek word not for poysoning but for all magicall arts as hierome testifieth vpon the place and that it must necessarily be so translated it is euident because in the next verse murther is termed another worke of the flesh vnder which poisoning and all other kinds of killing are comprehended and the same word is vsed in the like sense reu and againe the word mecashephah which moses vseth is ascribed to the inchanters of egypt in the and chapters of exodus and to the wisemen of babel daniel who are also called in the translation of the seauentie and both sorts of them were witches and sorcerers the kings of egypt and babylon vsed these mecashephim for sundrie purposes and made them of their counsell and if they had beene according to this allegation poisoners it is not like they would haue so fitted the humors of those two princes pharaoh and nebuchadne sar much lesse that they would haue so ordinarily required their presence and assistance in the businesse there mentioned thirdly there is a peremptorie law against the wilfull murtherer number that he should be put to death and that no recompence should be taken for his life in which place all poisoners are condemned because they are wilfull murtherers now if here in exodus by mecashephah we should vnderstand a poisoner then there should be one and the same law twice propounded for the same thing which is not like and therefore the word vsed by moses in this text signifieth not a poisoner properly but a witch hitherto i haue treated of the nature of witchcraft both in generall amp particular and haue also shewed what witches are both good and badde and now i proceede to the second point considered in this text the punishment of a witch and that is death in the iudiciall laws of moses wherof this is one the lord appointed sundrie penalties which in qualitie and degree differed one from another so as according to the nature of the offence was the proportion and measure of the punishment ordained and of all sinnes as those were the most heinous in account which tended directly to the dishonour of god so to them was assigned death the greatest and highest degree of punishment he that despised the law of moses died without mercy vnder two or three witnesses hebr the punishment of the theefe was restitution foure fold exod but the murtherer must be put to death numb the idolater and seducer were commanded to be slaine exod deut the blasphemer must be stoned leuit and the vvitch is numbred amongst these grieuous of fend rs therefore his punishment is as great as any other for the text saith he might not be suffered to liue exod but why should the vvitch be so sharply censured and what should mooue the lord to allot so high a degree of punishment to that sort of offenders ans the cause was not the hurt which they brought vpon man in bodie goods or outward estate for there be sundrie that neuer did harme but good onely vve reade not of any great hurt that was done by the inchanters of egypt or by the pythonisse of endor or by simon magus in samaria and those diuining vvitches which haue taken vpon them to foretell things to come hurt not any but themselues yet they must die the death this therefore is not the cause but what if these doe hurt or kill must they not then die yes verely but by another law the law of murther and not by the law of vvitchcraft for in this case he dieth as a murtherer and not as vvitch and so he should die though he were no vvitch the cause then of this sharpe punishment is the very making of a league with the deuill either secret or open whereby they couenant to vse his helpe for the working of wonders for by vertue of this alone it commeth to passe that vvitches can doe strange things in diuining inchanting and iugling now let it be obserued of what horrible impietie they stand guiltie before god who ioyne in confederacie with satan hereby they renounce the lord that made them they make no more account of his fauour and protection they doe quite cut themselues off from the couenant made with him in baptisme from the communion of the saints from the true worship and seruice of god and on the contrarie they giue themselues vnto satan as their god whome they continually feare and serue thus are they become the most detestable enemy to god and his people that can be for this cause samuel told saul that rebellion was as the sinne of witchcraft that is a most heinous amp detestable sinne in the sight of god the traytour that doth no hurt to his neighbour but is willing and readie to doe him the best seruices that can be desired is notwithstanding by the law of nation no be ter then a dead man because he betraies his soueraigne and consequently cannot be a friend vnto the common wealth in like manner though the witch were in many respects profitable and did no hurt but procured much good yet because he hath renounced god his king and gouernour and hath bound himselfe by other lawes to the seruice of the enemie of god and his church death is his portion iustly assigned him by god he may not liue thus hauing deliuered the true sense and interpretation of this iudiciall law both concerning the sinne of witchcraft amp the persons by whom this sinne is practised it remaineth now that i should make some vse thereof by way of application to the witches of our times in doing whereof foure particular questions of moment are to be handled ans if we doe well consider the qualitie and condition of the witches of our daies we shall easily see that they be the same for experience sheweth that whether they be man or woman but especially aged woman they be such persons as doe renounce god and their baptisme and make a league with the devil either secretly or openly in which the deuill bindeth himselfe to teach them certaine rites and ceremonies whereby they may be able to worke wonders as to stirre vp tempests to reueale secrets to kill or hurt man and cattell or to cure and doe good according to the tenour of their couenant the ioan fr pie m and de praenot l c confessions of witches recorded in the chronicles of country through all europe doe with common consent declare and manifest this point so that howsoeuer our vvitches may differ in some circumstances from those in the time of moses as either in the instruments and meanes vsed or in the manner and forme or in some particular ends of their practises yet in the substance and foundation of witchcraft they agree with them for both of them haue made a couenant with the deuill one way or other and by vertue thereof haue wrought wonders aboue the order of nature agreeing therefore in the verie foundation and forme of witchcraft which is the league and in the proper end the working of wonders they must needs be in substance and effect the same with the witches mentioned by moses and yet this point is denied by some and the witches of these daies haue their patrons who vse reasons to prooue that now we haue none such as we speake of their reasons are specially three first they labour to take away the forme of witchcraft affirming that there can be no confederacie made betweene the witch and the deuill and that for foure causes i in euery league and contract the parties must be mur ally bound each to other now betweene man or woman and the deuill there can be no bond made and though there could yet man is bound in conscience to god to renounce the bond of obedience to satan and to breake the couenant ans there be two sorts of leagues lawful and unlawful in all lawful leagues it is true that there must be a mutuall bond of both parties each to other which may not be dissolued but in unlawful compacts it is otherwise and no man can say that this league betweene a witch and the deuill is lawful but wicked and damnable yet beeing once made howsoeuer vnlawfully it is a league and compact this therefore prooueth not that there can be no couenant at all but that there can be no lawful couenant between them which no man will denie ii satan and the witch are of diverse natures he is spirituall they are corporall substances therefore there can be no league made betweene them ans the reason is not good for euen god himselfe who is of nature most simple and spirituall made a couenant with adam renued the same vnto abraham isaac and iacob and continueth it with his church on earth from age to age hence it appeareth that diuersitie of nature in the parties can not hinder the making of a couenant and therefore if man may make couenant with god himselfe who is most spirituall then may he likewise come in league with the deuill whose substance is not so pure and sp rituall againe we must remember that in making of a couenant it is sufficient that the parties consent and agree in will amp vnderstanding though other circumstances and rites which are but signes of confirmation be wanting be it then that satan hath not a bodily substance as man hath yet considering that man is indued with vnderstanding to coceiue of things as the deuill doth and hath also will to yeeld consent and approbation thereunto though in a corrupt and wicked manner there may passe a confederacie and a couenant may be made and stand in force betweene them iii whatsoeuer the deuill doth in this compact he doth it in fraud and deceit neuer meaning in his promises as man doth and when both parties meane not one amp the same thing how can they growe to agreement in any kind ans suppose this be true yet it onely prooueth that the couenant made betweene them was deceitfull and unlawful but what of that stil it remaineth a bargaine howsoeuer for it faileth onely in the circumstance the substance which is the consent of the parties was not wanting iv vvitches of our times say they are aged persons of weake braines and troubled with abundance of melancholie and the deuill taketh aduantage of the humor and so deludes them perswading that they haue made a league with him when they haue not and consequently moouing them to imagine that they doe and may doe strange things which indeed are done by himselfe and not by them ans this reason is a meere melancholike conceit without ground and the contrarie is a manifest truth that they are not so as is affirmed parties deceiued by reason of their humors for first our vvitches are as wise and politike yes as craftie and cunning in all other matters as other man be whereas brainsicke persons troubled with melancholy if their vnderstanding be distempered in one action it will be faultie likewise in others more or lesse againe our vvitches know that they sinne in their practises of vvitchcraft and therefore they vse subtill meanes to couer them and he that would conuict them must haue great dexteritie to goe beyond them now if they were persons deluded through corruption of any humors looke what humour caused them to doe a thing the same would vrge them to disclose it thirdly they are also of the same stamp they take the same courses in all their practises their consent in word and action is vniuersall man of learning haue obserued that all witches through europe are of like cariage and behauiour in their examinations and conuictions they vse the same answers refuges defenses protestations in a word looke what be the practises and courses of the witches in england in any of these particulars the same be the practises of the witches in spaine fraunce italie germany ampc wherefore the case is cleare they are not deluded by sathan through the force of humour s is auouched for such persons according as they are diuersly ake would shewe themsel es diuersly affected and varie in their speeches actions and conceipts both publike and priuate fourthly our witches are wont to communicate their skill to others by tradition to teach and instruct their children and posteritie and to initiate them in the grounds and practises of their owne rade while they liue as may appeare by the confessions recorded in the courts of all country but if they were persons troubled with melancholie their conceipts would die with them for conceits and imaginarie ancies which rise of any humour cannot be conuayed from partie to partie no more then the humour it selfe lastly if this slight might serue to defend witches vnder pretence of delusion through corrupted humour then here were a couer for all manner of sinnes for example a fellon is apprehended for robberie or murther and is brought before the iudge vpon examination he confesseth the fact beeing conuicted the law proceeds to condemnation the same mans freinds come in and alledge before the iudge in this maner this man hath a crazie braine and is troubled with melancholy and though he hath confessed the fact yet the truth is it was not he but the deuill who himselfe committed the murther and made him thinke he did it when he did it not amp hereupon he hath confessed would any man thinke that this were a reasonable allegation and a sufficient meane to mooue the iudge to acquite him assuredly if it were vpon the same ground might any sinne be laid vpon the devil backe and all good lawes and iudiciall proceedings be made voide therefore howsoeuer the patrons of witches be learned man yet they are greatly deceiued in fathering the practises of sorcerie vpon a melancholike humour but for the further ratifying of their assertion they proceede and vse this argument they which confesse of themselues things false and impossible must needs be parties deluded but our witches doe this when they be examined or consulted with as that they can raise tempests that they are caried through the aire in a moment from place to place that they passe through keyholes and clifts of doores that they be sometimes turned into catts hares and other creatures lastly that they are brought into farre country to meete with herodias diana and the deuill and such like all which are mere fables and things impossible ans we must make a difference of witches in regard of time there is a time when they first beginne to make a league with satan and a time also after the league is made and confirmed when they first beginne to grow in confederacie with the deuill they are sober and their vnderstanding sound they make their match waking and as they thinke wisely enough knowing both what they promise the deuill and vpon what conditions and therefore all this while it is no delusion but after they be once in the league and haue beene intangled in compact with the deuill considerately as they thinke for their owne good and aduantage the case may be otherwise for then reason and vnderstanding may be depraued memorie weakned and all the powers of their soule blemished thus becomming his vassalls they are deluded and so intoxicated by him that they wil run into thousands of fantasticall imaginations holding themselues to be transformed into the shapes of other creatures to be transported in the ayre into other country yes to do many strange things which in truth they doe not i come now to their second reason the witches of our age say they were not knowne in the daies of moses nor of christ therfore that law concerneth them not to this i answer two waies first that their argument is naught for by the same reason the papists might auouch the lawfulnes of the images of saints as of peter paul and others yes of christ himselfe because they were not knowne in the daies of moses and therefore could not be condemned in the second commandement whereas contrarily the spirit of god hath so framed and penned the lawes morall and iudiciall which concerne man as that they fetch within their compasse all sinnes of all ages and condemne them and therefore whatsoeuer is against the law of god written by moses though it were not knowne nor heard of either when the law was made or afterward is yet condemned by the same law againe i answer that our witches are the same that were in moses time and therfore by their owne reason must needes be condemned by this iudiciall lawe for by the records of auncient writers it is prooued that about a yeares before christs birth shortly after the troian war which was yeare and vpward before the building of the temple by salomon there were the same vvitches that are now as the circes and syrenes and such like mentioned in the homer lib amp narration of that war as is manifest to them that knowe the storie againe yeares before christ when the romans made their sub tit de intur al sque deli t c sence lib nat est ampc twelue tables which comprised all the lawes whereby that famons commonvvealth vvas gouerned they made one expressely against witches euen the same vvith these of our time for practising the same things as blasting of corne hurting of cattell mer vvomen and children ampc and for the time of christ though there be no particular mention made of any such witches yet thence it followeth not that there were none for all things that then happened were not recorded and i would faine know of the chiefe patrons of them whether those parties possessed with the deuill and troubled with strange diseases whom christ healed and out of whom he cast deuills were not bewitched with some such people as our witches are if they say no let them if they can prooue the contrarie the third amp last reason is this christ at his comming abolished all sinne and therfore miracles amp witchcraft the ceased also the apostle saith that he spoiled principality and powers and triumphed ouer them vpon the crosse coloss ans this argument is friuolous seruing as well to iustifie the traytor the theefe and the murtherer as the witch for whereas it is alleadged that christ abolished all sinne we must vnderstand how not simply so as sinne should be no more but onely in part in this life reseruing the final destruction thereof to the last iudgement againe sinne is not abolished no not in part vnto all but onely to the members of christ whereupon the apostle sa h there is no condemnation to them that are in christ rom because no sinne is imputed vnto them but vnto witches and all the enemy of christ sinne is imputed and not abolished to conclude howsoeuer much is said in their defence yet the first part is cleare affirmatiuely that the witches of our time are the same with the witches that were in moses time in truth and substance and so much for the first question ans the discouerie of a witch is a matter iudiciall as is also the discouerie of a theefe and a murtherer and belongeth not to euerie man but is to be done iudicially by the magistrate according to the forme and order of law who therefore is set apart for such ends and hath authoritie both to discouer and to punish the enemy of god and his church now for the magistrates directio in this busines we are to know that in the discouerie of a vvitch two things are required examination and conuiction examination is an action of the magistrate making speciall enquirie of the crime of witchcraft this action must haue the beginning from occasions and presumptions for the magistrate though he be a publike person and stand in the roome of god for the execution of iustice yet he may not take vpon him to examine whom and how himselfe willeth of any crime neither ought he to proceed vpon sleight causes as to shewe his authoritie ouer others or vpon sinister respects as to renenge his malice or to bring parties into danger or suspition but he must proceede vpon speciall presumptions those i call presumptions which doe at least probably and coniectutally note one to be a vvitch and these are certaine signes whereby the partie may be discouered i will touch some few of them the first in order is this if any person man or woman be notoriously defamed for such a partie notorious desamation is a common report of the greater sort of people with whom the partie suspected dwelleth that he or she is a witch this yeeldeth a strong suspition yet the magistrate must be warie in receiuing such a report for it falls our oftentimes that the innocent may be suspected and some of the better sort notoriously desamed therfore the wise and prudent iudge ought carefully to looke that the report be made by man of honestie and credit which if it be he may then proceede to make further inquirie or the fact the second is if a fellow witch or magician giue testimonie of any person to be a witch either voluntarily or at his or her examination or at his or her death this is not sufficient for conuiction or condemnation but onely a fit presumption to strait examination of the partie to be made thirdly if after cursing there followeth death or at least some mischiefe for vvitches are wont to practise their mischieuous facts by cursing and banning this also is a sufficient matter of examination not of conuiction fourthly if after enmitie quarelling or threatning a present mischiefe doth follow for parties deuillishly disposed after corsings doe vse threatnings and that also is a great presumption fiftly if the partie suspected be the son or daughter the manseruant or maidseruant the familiar friend eere neighbour or old copanion of a known and conuicted witch this may be likewise a presumption for witchcraft is an article that may be learned and conueied from man to man and often it falleth out that a vvitch dying leaueth some of the forenamed heires of her witchcraft sixtly some doe adde this for a presumption if the partie suspected be found to haue the deuills marke for it is commonly thought when the deuill maketh his couenant with then he alwaies leaueth his marke behinde him whereby he knowes them for his owne now if by some casuall meanes such a marke be descried on the bodie of the partie suspected whereof no euident reason in nature can be giuen the magistrate in this case may cause such to be examined or take the matter into his owne hand that the truth may appeare lastly if the partie examined be vnconstant or contrarie to himselfe in his deliberate answers it argueth a guiltie minde and conscience which stoppeth the freedome of speech and vtterance and may giue iust occasion to the magistrate to make further enquirie i say nor if he or shee be timorous and fearefull for a good man may be fearefull in a good cause sometimes by nature sometimes in regard of the presence of the iudge and the greatnes of the andience againe some may be suddenly taken and others naturally want the libertie of speech which other man haue and these are the causes of feare amp astonishment which may befall the good as well as the bad touching the manner of examination there be two kinds of proceeding either by a single question or by some torture a single question is when the magistrate himselfe onely maketh enquirie what was done or not done by bare and naked interrogations a torture is when besides the enquirie in words he vseth also the racke or some other violent meanes to vrge confession this course hath beene taken in some country and may no doubt lawfully and with good conscience be vsed howbeit not in euery case but onely vpon strong and great presumptions going before and when the partie is obstinate and thus much for examination now followeth conuiction conuiction is an action of the magistrate after iust examination discouering the witch this action must proceed from iust amp sufficient proofes and not from bare presumptions for though presumptions giue occasion to examine yet they are no sufficient causes of conuiction now in generall the prooses vsed for conuiction are of two sorts some be lesse sufficient some be more sufficient the lesse sufficient proofes are these first in former ages the party suspected of witchcraft was brought before the magistrate who caused red hoat iron and scalding water to be brought and commanded the partie to put his hand in the one or to take vp the other or both and if he tooke vp the iron in his bare hand without burning or endured the water without scalding hereby he was cleared and iudged free but if he did burne or scalde he was then conuicted and condemned for a witch but this manner of conuiction hath long agone beene condemned for wicked and diabolicall as in truth it is considering that thereby many times an innocent man may be condemned and a rancke witch scape vnpunished againe our owne times haue afforded instances of such weake and insufficient proofes as first scratching of the suspected partie and present recouerie thereupon secondly burning of the thing bewitched if it be not a man as a hogge or oxe or such like creature is imagined to be a forcible meanes to cause the witch to discouer her selfe thirdly the burning of the thatch of the suspected parties house which is thought to be able to cure the partie bewitched and to make the witch to bewray her selfe besides these in other country they haue a further proofe iustified by some that be learned the partie is taken and bound hand and foote and cast crosse waies into the water if she sincke shee is counted innocent and escapeth if shee fleete on the water and sincke not she is taken for a witch conuicted and accordingly punished all these proofes are so farre from beeing sufficient that some of them if not all are after a sort practises of witchcraft hauing in them no power or vertue to detect a sorcerer either by god ordinace in the creation or by any speciall appointment since for what vertue can the scratching of a witch haue to cure a hurt where doe we finde it in any part of the word of god that scratching should be vsed or what promise of recouerie vpon the vse thereof but how then comes it to passe that helpe is often procured by these amp such like meanes ans it is the sleight and subtiltie of the deuill vpon scratching the witch to remooue such hurts as himselfe hath inflicted that thereby he may invre man to the practise of wicked and superstitious meanes and what i say of scratching the same may be enlarged to all other proofes of this kind before named god hath imprinted no such vertue in their natures to these purposes or added the same vnto them by speciall and extraordinarie assignment that therefore which is brought to passe by them when they are vsed commeth from the deuill and yet to iustifie the casting of a witch into the water it is alleadged that hauing made a couenant with the deuill shee hath renounced her baptisme and hereupon there growes an antipathie betweene her and water ans this allegation serues to no purpose for all water is not the water of baptisme but that onely whi h is vsed in the very act of baptisme and not before nor after the element out of the vse of the sacrament is no sacrament but returnes againe to his common vse to goe yet further an other insufficient proofe is the testimonie of some wizzard it hath beene the ordinarie custome of some man when they haue had any thing ill at ease presently to go or send to some wise man or wise woman by whome they haue beene informed that the thing is bewitched and to winne credit to their answer some of them haue offred to shew the witches face in a glasse whereof the partie hauing taken notice returnes home and detecteth the man of woman of witchcraft this i graunt may be a good presumption to cause strait examination but a sufficient proofe of conuiction it can not be for put the case the grand iurie at the assises goeth on a partie suspected and in their consultation the deuill comes in the likenesse of some knowne man and tells them the person in question is indeede a witch and offers withall to confirme the same by oath should the inquest receiue his oath or accusation to condemne the man assuredly no and yet that is as much as the testimonie of another wizzard who onely by the devil helpe reuealeth the witch if this should be taken for a sufficient proofe the deuill would not leaue one good man aliue in the world againe all other presumptions commonly vsed are insufficient though they may minister occasion of triall for example if a man in open court should affirme before the iudge such a one fell out with me and cursed me giuing me threatning words that i should smart for it and some mischiefe should light vpon my person or goods ere it were long vpon these curses and threats presently such and such euills befell me and i suffered these and these losses the magistrate thus informed may safely proceed to inquire into the matter but he hath not fro hence any sure ground of conuiction for it pleaseth god many times to lay his hand vpon mens persons and goods without the procurement of witches and yet experience shewes that ignorant people who carrie a rage against them wil make strong proofes of such presumptions whereupon sometime iurers doe giue their verdict against parties innocent lastly if a man beeing dangerously sicke and like to die vpon suspition will take it on his death that such a one hath bewitched him it is an allegation of the same nature which may mooue the iudge to examine the partie but it is of no moment for conuiction the reason is because it was but the suspition of one man and a mans owne word for himselfe though in time of extremitie when it is likely he will speake nothing but the truth is of no more force then another mans word against him and these are the proofes which man in place and time haue ordinarily vsed for the detecting of such vngodly persons but the best that may be saide of them is that they be all either false or vncertaine signes and vnauaileable for the codemnation of any man whatsoeuer now follow the true proofes and sufficient meanes of conuiction all which may be reduced to two heads the first is the free and voluntarie confession of the crime made by the partie suspected and accused after examination this hath beene thought generally of all man both diuines and lawyer a proofe sufficient for what needs more witnes or further enquirie when a man from the touch of his owne conscience acknowledgeth the fault and yet the patrons and aduocates of witches except against it and obiect in this manner that a man or woman may confesse against themselues an vntruth beeing vrged thereto either by feare or threatning or by a desire vpon some griefe conceiued to be out of the world or at least beeing in trouble and perswaded it is the best course to saue their liues and obtaine libertie they may vpon simplicitie be induced to confesse that which they neuer did euen against themselues ans i say not that a bare confession is sufficient but a confession after due examination taken vpon pregnant presumptions for if a man examined without any ground or presumptions should openly acknowledge the crime his act may be iustly suspected as grouded vpon by respects but when proceeding is made against him at the first vpon good probabilities and hereupon he be drawn to a free confession that which he hath manifested therby cannot but be a truth other points of exception vrged by them are of small moment and may easily be answered out of the grounds before deliuered and therefore i omit them now if the partie held in suspition be examined and will not confesso but obstinately persist in deniall as commonly it falleth out then there is another course to be taken by a second sufficient meanes of conuiction which is the testimonie of two witnesses of good and honest report auouching before the magistrate vpon their owne knowledge these two things either that the partie accused hath made a league with the deuill or hath done some knowne practises of witchcraft and all arguments that doe necessarily prooue either of these beeing brought by two sufficient witnesses are of force fully to conuince the partie suspected for example first if they can prooue that the partie suspected hath inuocated and called vpon the deuill or desired his helpe for this is a branch of that worshippe which satan bindeth his instruments to giue vnto him and it is a pregnant proofe of a league formerly made betweene them secondly if they can giue euidence that the partie hath intertained a familiar spirit and had conference with it in forme or likenesse of a mouse catte or some other visible creature thirdly if they affirme vpon oath that the suspected person hath done any action or worke which necessarily inferreth a couenant made as that he hath shewed the face of a man suspected beeing absent in a glasse or vsed inchantment or such like feats in a word if they both can auouch vpon their own proper knowledge that such a man or woman suspected haue put in practise any other actions of witchcraft as to haue diuined of things afore they came to passe and that peremptorily to haue raised tempests to haue caused the forme of a dead man to appeare or the like standing either in diuination or operation it prooueth sufficiently that he or she is a witch but some may say if these be the onely strong proofes for the conuiction of a sorcerer it will be then impossible to put any one to death because the league with satan is closely made and the practises of sor erie are also very secret and hardly can a man be brought which vpon his owne knowledge can auerre such things i answer howsoeuer both the ground and practise be secret and to many vnknowne yet there is a way to come to the knowledge thereof for it is vsuall with satan to promise any thing till the league be ratified but when it is once made and the partie intangled in societie with him then he indeauoureth nothing more then his or her dise uefie and vseth all meanes possible to diclose them so that what ende soeuer the witch propoundeth to her selfe in the league he intende nothing else but her vtter confusion therefore in the iust iudgement of god it often filleth out that these which are true witches indeede shall either by confession discouer themselues or by true testimonie be conuinced the causes which mooue the deuill not onely to affect but to hasten this discouer it are two principally the first is his malice towards all man in so high a degree that he cannot indure they should enioy the world or the benefits of this life if it were possible so much as one houre though therefore by vertue of the precontract he be cock sure of his instrument yet his malice is not herewith satisfied till the partie be brought to light and condemned to death which may be a caueat so all ill disposed persons that they beware of yeelding themselues vnto him the second is his infatiable desire of the present and full possession of them whome he hath got within the bonds of the couenant for though he haue good hope of them yet is he not certen of their continuance the reason is because some united with him in confederacie haue through the great mercie of god by carefull vsage of holy meanes and faith in christ been reclaimed and deliuered out of his bondage and so at length freed from his couenant so as he hath eternally left them hence it is that he labours by might and maine to keepe them in ignorance and to preuent the vsage of meanes effectuall to ther conuersion by laying a plot for their discouerie b t how then comes it to passe that all such persons are not speedily detected but some liue long and others die without any mans priuitie ans the reasons hereof may be diverse first because some one or more of them may belong to god election and therefore albeit for causes best knowne to himselfe he may suffer them for a time to be holden in the snares of satan yet at length in mercie he reclaimes them and in the me ne time suffreth not the deuill to exercise the depth of his malice in discouering them to their confusion againe for others the lord may in iustice and anger suffer them not to be disclosed that liuing vnder the meanes where they might be reclaimed and wilfully contemning the same they may liue to fill vp the measure of their iniquities and thereby be made finally inexcusable that they may receiue their iuster condemnation secondly tho deuill suffereth some to liue long vndisclosed that they may exercise the greater measure of his malice in the world specially if they be parties malitiously bent to doe hurt to man and other creatures thirdly some witches doe warily agree with the deuill for a certaine tearme of yeares d ring which time he bindeth himselfe not to hurt them but to be at their command and satan is carefull specially in case of his owne aduantage to keepe touch with them that they may the more strongly clea e vnto him on their parts but if the case so stand that neither the partie suspected confesseth nor yet sufficient vvitnesses can be produced vvhich are able to conuict him or her either of these two waies we haue no warrant out of the word either in generall or in speciall to put such a one to death for though presumptions be neuer so strong yet they are not proofes sufficient for conuiction but onely for examination i would therefore with and aduise all iurers who giue their verdict vpon life and death in courts of assises to take good he de that as they he diligent in zeale of god glorie and the good of his church in derecting of witches by all sufficient and lawful meanes so likewise they would be carefull what they doe and not to condemne any partie suspected vpon bare presumptions without sound and sufficient proofes hat they be not guiltie through their owne of shedding innocent blood to this question we answer affirmatiuely that a man may and for the manifestation of this point the remedies of witch craft are to be considered in the ha dling whereof i will proceede in this order first to set down the true lawful and allowed and prescribed in the word secondly the unlawful amp superstitions meanes prescribed and practised in the roman church lawful remedies of witchcraft be of two sorts preseruatiue and restoratiue preseruatiue are those which keep a man from the hurt of witchcraft and these be of two sorts either such as keepe safe the persons of man or such as preserue the places of mens aboad for the persons of man there is one soueraigne preseruatiue and that is to be within the couenant of grace made and confirmed in the gospel by the blood of christ and that not outwardly in profession onely as all those be which are within the compasse of the church but truly and indeede as all the elect are and a man is then in the couenant when god of his grace in the vse of the meanes giues him a true knowledge of the nature of it and of conditions required in the same on both parts and withall giues him a true and liuely faith to apprehend and apply to himselfe the promise of god in christ touching remission of sinnes and life euerlasting yet further to shew forth his faith by the fruits of true repentance and new obedience when a man in this manner comes to be brought within the couenant and is in christ he then receiues assurance of god auour and to him belong the promises depending thereupon to wit not onely of the comfortable presence of god spirit but of the presence and speciall protection of his holy angels to pitch their tents about him to keepe him safe in soule and bodie from the power and malicious practises of satan and his members the ground of this assistance is laide downe in the word psalm he shall giue his angels charge ouer thee ampc and the speach of balaam confirmeth the same who when he was hired of balac to curse god people and had oftentimes assayed to doe it but could not at last he brake out into this confession there is no witchcraft against iacob nor sorcerie against israel for so the words are to be read according to the true meaning and circumstances of the text as if he should haue said i was of thine opinion o balac that israel might be cursed but after triall made i found by good experience that i could doe that people of god no hurt by mine inchantments howbeit we must here remember that the promise of protection made vnto god children is not absolute but admitteth exception as all other promises of temporall blessing doe and that in this manner thou shalt be partaker of this or that blessing and this or that curse shall be remooued if it be expedient for thee but if for speciall causes to t e thy faith and to exercise thy patience i make deniall thou must rest thy selfe in my good will and pleasure by warrant of this doctrine a question commonly mooued may be resolued whether the servant and child of god may be bewitched or nor out of that which hath beene said i answer he may and that is plaine by the word for by god permission the holy bodie of christ himselfe was by satan transported from place to place matth righteous iob was miserably afflicted in his bodie by the power of the deuill and his children who no doubt were god servant and brought vp in his feare as their father was were slaine by the same power yes christ himselfe testifieth luke that a daughter of abraham that is of the faith of abraham had beene troubled eighteene yeares with a spirit of infirmitie which the deuill caused by bowing her bodie together so as she could not lift her selfe vp v and therefore whereas some man are of this minde that their faith is so strong that all the witches in the world and all the deuills in hell cannot hurt them they are much deceiued this their faith is but a fond presumption and no true faith for no man in the earth can absolutely assure himselfe of safetie and protection from the deuill and if any could it were the child of god but salomon saith that all outward things may come alike both to the good and to the bad eccle howbeit in this case there is great difference between the servant of god and an vnrepentant sinner though the godly man be not exempted from witchcraft yet he is a thousand folde more free from the power thereof then other man are for there is onely one case and no more wherein the deuill hath any way power to hurt him and that is whe it pleaseth god by that kind of crosse to make triall of his faith and patience and out of this case he is alwaies free from the annoyance of the vilest witches in the world if then this be the onely soueraigne preseruatiue to keepe a man safe and sure from the power of witches and of the deuill to haue part in the couenant of grace to be made partaker of christ by a true faith testified by dying vnto all sinne and liuing vnto god in ewnes of life we must not content our selues with a formall confession as many in the visible church doe which wanting the life of faith doe not liue in christ but striue to goe further and to adorne our profession by framing our liues according to the word that we may haue our portion in this excellent priuiledge of preseruation from the power and malice of the enemy of god and all vngodly persons preseruatiues of the second sort are such as concerne the places of mens aboad for satan contenteth not himselfe to haue manifested his malice in afflicting mens persons but he also enlargeth the same to the molestation of the places where they dwell by insecting the ayre and such like the onely effectuall meanes to remedie this euill is the sanctification of the places of our habitation looke as we are wont to sanctifie our meate and drinke by god word and by praier and thereby procure his blessing vpon his owne ordinance for our refreshing so in like manner may we sanctifie the places of our aboad and thereby both procure the blessing which we want and also auoid many curses and dangers which otherwise would fall vpon vs if any shall thinke the consecration of houses and places in this sort to be a meere deuise of mans braine let them remember that in the old testament besides the dedication of the temple allowed by all there was a law prescribed to the iewes for the speciall dedication of euery mans house if any hath built a new house saith moses and hath not dedicated it let him returne againe ampc d ut as who should say he hath omitted a necessarie dutie now this dedication was nothing els but the sanctification of them by word and prayer wherein they made acknowledgement that they became theirs by the free gift and blessing of god and further desired a free and lawful vse of the same to his glorie and their mutuall good a dutie which hath been performed by the servant of god in ancient times the first thing that abraham did when he came from vr of the chaldeans to the land of canaan which god gaue him to possesse was the building of an altar for the worship of god his sacrificing thereon and calling vpon the name of the lord gen the same did noah before him at his first comming out of the arke after the flood gen and iacob after him in bethel and they were al mooued hereunto because they knew their comfortable aboad in those places came not by their owne endeauour but from the blessing of god when the good king hezekiah kept the passeouer in ierusalem his principall care was that the priests and all the people might first be sanctified and therefore he praied vnto god to be mercifull to them that were not sanctified chronicle and as he behaued himselfe in his kingdome so should euery master of a familie behaue himselfe in his house where he dwelleth labouring to sanctifie the same that it may be comfortable to him and his least for neglect thereof he pull vpon himselfe and those that belong vnto him the heauie hand of god in plagues and punishments the second kinde of remedies are restoratiue which serue to deliuer man from witchcraft by curing the hurts of witches in the body of man or other creatures in the handling whereof first we will consider how whole country and then how euery priuate man may be cured and deliuered whole country and kingdomes are freed and cured specially by one meanes the publishing and embracing of the gospel when our sauiour christ had sent the seauentie disciples to preach in iurie at their returne he gaue this testimonie of the effect of their ministerie that he saw satan fall downe from heauen like lightening luke his meaning was this as lightning is suddenly and violently sent out of the cloud and as it were cast downe to the earth by the cracke of the thunders euen so satan the prince of the world that ruleth in the hearts of the disobediet was cast down and his kingdome ruinated by the power of the gospel preached in the times of ignorance the deuill triumpheth freely without controlment but the mist and darkenes of his delusions cannot possibly abide the bright beames of god glorious will reuealed by preaching the lord of auncient times commanded his people not to doe according to those nation among whome they dwelt in canaan by practising witchcraft or following after sorcerie deut ampc and that they might be able to obey this commandement moses prescribeth vnto them this restoratiue the reuerent and obedient hearing of the lord prophets v in this our church if we would be healed of our wounds and banish satan from among vs who greatly annoieth a great number of our people by his delusions and damnable practises of sorcerie the onely way to bring it to passe is the maintaining of a learned ministerie the aduacing of prophets by whose labors the gospel may flourish for the faithfull dispensation thereof is the lord owne arme and scepter whereby he beateth downe the kingdome of darkenesse and confoundeth the workes and enterprise of the deuill the second sort of restoratiues serue for the cure of particular persons for howsoeuer the gift and power of casting out deuills and curing witchcraft be ordinarily ceased since the apostles times it beeing a gift pecu liar to the primitiue church and giuen to it onely during the infancie of the gospel yet there may be meanes vsed and that effectuall for the easing of any person that is bewitched by satans instruments those therefore that are in these daies ormented in this kind must doe three things first they must enter into a serious examination of themselues and consider the cause for which it pleaseth god to suffer satan to exercise them with that kind of crosse and here vpon diligent enquirie they shall finde that their owne sinnes are the true and proper causes of these euills when saul was disobedient to the commandement of god the lord sent vpon him an euill spirit to vexe him sam hymeneus and alexander for their pestilent errors were both cast out of the church and giuen vp also to satan that they might learne not to blaspheme tim in the same manner was the incestuous person dealt withall corinthian secondly after this examination the same parties must shewe forth their faith whereby they depend on the free fauour and mercie of god for their deliuerance how may this be done by heartie prayer vnto god ioyned with fasting that the same may be more earnest in which prayer the maine desire of the heart must be absolutely for the pardon of their sinnes and then for deliuerance from the hurts and torments of diabolicall persons yet not absolutely as for the other but with this condition so farre forth as it stands with god glorie and their owne good for these are the bounds and limits of all temporall good things of them the lord makes no absolute promise but with these conditions amp qualifications thirdly the parties bewitched must patiently beare the present annoyance comforting themselues with this that it is the lord own hand by whose speciall prouidence it comes to passe and who turneth all things to the good of his chosen againe they are to remember that he beeing a most wise god and louing father in christ will not suffer them to be tried aboue that they are able to beare but in his good time will grant a ioyfull issue now when the bewitched shall thus submit themselues vnto god in the crosse be it that he vpon some causes deferre their deliuerance yet they shall not finally be deceiued of their hope for either in this life at the appointed time or in the end of this life by death they shall be eternally deliuered and put in present possession of euerlasting case and happines thus much of the true remedies against witchcraft in the next place we are a little to examine the false and superstitious remedies prescribed and vsed by them of the popish church the most learned papists of this age doe teach and auouch that there is in god church an ordinarie gift amp power whereby some man may cast out deuills and helpe annoyances that come by witches the protestant is of a contrarie iudgement and holdeth according to truth that there is now no such ordinary gift left to the church of god since the daies of the apostles reasons of this opinio may be these first casting out of deuills and curing such annoyances are extraordinarie and miraculous workes for christ accounteth handling of serpents without hurt speaking with newe tongues curing of diseases by imposition of hands all which are things of lesse moment to be miracles mark but all these less works yes the ordinarie power of working them is ceased for it was onely giuen to the apostles in the primitiue church as a meanes to confirme the doctrine of the gospel to vnbeleeuers that neuer heard of christ before so paul saith strange tongues that is the gift of speaking strange languages without ordinarie teaching are for asigne not to them that beleeue but to them that beleeue not corinthian and for the same ende were all extraordinarie gifts then giuen seeing therefore the doctrine of the gospell hath beene alreadie established and the truth thereof sufficiently confirmed by miracles in the primitiue church the same gift must needes cease vnto vs for if it should still continue it would call into question the effect of the apostolicall preaching and implie thus much that the gospel was not well established nor sufficiently confirmed by their extraordinarie ministerie and miracles accompanying the same againe if the gift of working miracles should remaine then the promise of god for his speciall and extraordinarie assistance therein should yet continue for the gift and promise goe together so long as the promise is in force so long is the gift also but the promise made by christ in my name shall they cast out deuills and speake with new tongues mark was in force onely in the persons and ministerie of the apostles and those that had extraordinarie and immediate calling from god and it ceased when they and their calling ceased therefore if ministers now should lay their hands on the sicke they should not recouer them if they should annoint them with oyle it should doe them no good because they haue no promise howbeit the papists stand stiffely in defending the continuance of these gifts first they say the church of the new testament is nothing inferiour to that of the old the iewish church before the comming of christ was the church of the old testament and had the power and gift of casting our deuills so saith our sauiour himselfe matth if i through beelzebub cast out deuills then by whome doe your children cast them out in which words he ascribeth this gift vnto the iewes therefore it should seeme the same remaineth still in the church ans that place of scripture is diuersly expounded some by children there mentioned vnderstand the apostles who were iewes borne and had receiued from christ this gift amp power to cast out deuills which if it be so it maketh not for them because they had it extraordinarily but i rather thinke that by children are meant the exorcising iewes before christs time who did cast out deuills among them pretending an abilitie to doe this worke in the name of god whereas in truth they were all flat sorcerers and did it by vertue of a league amp compact made with the deuill which practise hath been of long continuance and is at this day common and vsuall among the popish sort and that there were such exorcists among the iewes it is euident for such were those vagabonds which came to ephesus and tooke vpon them to cast out deuills by the name of iesus and paul act but the man in whome the euill spirit was so soone as they adjuced the spirit ranne vpon them and mightily preuailed against them v now if they had done this great worke by the power of god as they pretended the holy ghost would not haue called them e orcists and vagabonds neither could the euill spirit possibly haue ouercome them as he did againe in the history of the iewes are recorded many practises of stich as exercised this power among them raphael the angel telleth tobias that a perfume made of the heart and liuer of a fish will helpe a man vexed with an euill spirit tob which counsell is fla magicke for there is no such vertue in the liuer of a fish and in other history we read that one bliaz r a iew by the smell of a certaine roote put to the nose of a man possessed with a deuill caused the deuill to come out of his n strills and forsake him which thing was done in publike place before v spasian and others this also was effected by meere conjuration for what vertue can there be in any roote or hearb in the world a aileable to command and enforce satan to depart from a man possessed and yet such fea es were plaied by sundrie magici ns among the iewes whereupon i conclude that the meaning of our sauionr in the place alleadged is in effect thus much if the power of beelzebub ampc that is you haue among you sundrie magicians and exorcists who pretend and exercise the gift of casting out deuills and you thinke they doe it by the power of god why then do you not carie the same opinion of me also their second reason is grounded on the promise of christ mark these tokens shall follow them that beleeue in my name they shal cast out d uills ampc whence they gather that there shall be alwaies some in the church who shall haue power to cast forth deuills if they beleeue answer that promise was made by christ vnto his church to be fulfilled immediately after his ascension it did not extend to all times and persons so long as the world endureth but onely to the times of the primitiue church and to such as then liued for to them onely the doctrine of the gospel was to be confirmed by signes and miracles and this lasted about yeares next after christ his ascension during which time not onely the apostles and ministers but euen priuate man and souldiers wrought many miracles the third reason is taken from experience which as they say in all ages from the apostles times to this day sheweth that there haue beene alwaies some in the church which haue had this gift of casting out deuills and curing the hurts of witchcraft ans this gift continued not much aboue the space of yeares after christ from which time many heresies beganne to spread themselues and then shortly after popery that mysterie of iniquitie beginning to spring vp and to dilate it selfe in the churches of europe the true gift of working miracles then ceased and in stead thereof came in delusions and lying wonders by the effectuall working of satan as it was foretold by the apostles thess of which sort were and are all those miracles of the roman church whereby simple people haue beene notoriously deluded these indeede haue there continued from that time to this day but this gift of the holy ghost whereof the question is made ceased long before to proceede yet further we are here to consider the particular remedies which they of the popish church haue prescribed against the hurts that haue come by witchcraft and they are principally fiue i first for the name iesus thus much we grant that any christian may lawfully call vpon the name of iesus in prayer for the helpe and deliuerance of those that are possessed and bewitched but yet with the caueat and conditi n before specified if it be the wil of god and if their recouerie may make for his glorie the benefit of the church and the good of the parties diseased but the papist by the vse of this name intendeth a further m ter to wit that the very name vttered in so many letters and sillables is powerfull to cast out deuills and to helpe those that are bewitched for when it is vttered then say they the authoritie of christ is present that the worke may be done a flat vntruth and a practise full of daunger for let this be well considered whatsoeuer any man doth in this case he must doe it by vertue of his calling and haue also his warrant for the doing th reof out of the word which if he want and yet will vndertake such a worke he may iustly feare the like euent that befell the vagabond iewes that were exorcists act now the church of christ hath no warrat in the word to vse this name of christ for any such purpose neither hath any ordinary christian a special calling from god so to doe therefore he may not doe it and whereas they would beare man in hand that the saide name of all the names of christ and aboue all other things is of most special vertue though it be vsed euen by a man that wanteth faith because the apostle saith at the name of iesus euery knee shall ow both of things in heauen in earth and vnder the earth philipp and by things vnder the earth are meant the deuill we must know that their allegation is weake and that they greatly abuse the place for there the name iesus is not onely a title of christ but withall signifieth the power maiestie amp authoritie of christ sitting at the right hand of the father to which all creatures in heauen earth and hell are made subiects and by that power indeede if they had it at command they might be able to cure the hurts of witchcraft ii the second speciall remedie is the vse of saints reliques as the bookes bones apparel staues or such like which being but touched of the parties vexed are excellent meanes to recouer them ans the vse of these things to the purposes aforesaid is a meere superstitious practise for first they haue not the true reliques of the saints as would plainely appeare if a true inuentorie were taken of all such as they say are to befound in their monasteries amp churches secodly though they had the yet they haue no or calling to vse the to this end for in al the word of god there is neither comandement to warrant the vse nor promise to assure any man of a blessing vpon the vse of them albeit they would seeme to haue some warrant and therefore they alleadge that which is written king of a dead man who beeing for hast thrown into the sepulchre of elisha so soone as he touched the bones of elisha reuiued and stood vpon his feete to this also they adde the examples of cures done by peters shadow act and of sundrie diseases healed by pauls handkerchiefs act ans these thingsin deede are true but they serue nothing to their purpose for first the quickning of the dead souldier came not from any vertue in the corps of elisha but it was a miracle which it pleaseth god then to worke by meanes of the corps that the iewes at that time might be confirmed in the truth of that doctrine which elisha had taught them from god and which before his death they had neglected as i haue before shewed and it was a thing onely then done and neuer since it cannot therefore be a ground for the ordinarie vse of reliques againe touching the other examples i answer that both peter a d paul had the gift of working miracles amp hauing the gift they might vse such meanes for the present to cure disease but the papists are not able to shewe that god hath giuen them the like gift whereby they might be warranted for the vse of the like meanes neither can they assuredly hope for successe although they should vndertake to vse them iii the third remedie is the signe of the crosse made vpon the bodie of the partie tormented behold to what an height of impietie they are growne ascribing that to the creature which is proper to the creartor for the power of working miracles is proper onely to the godhead the prophets and apostles in their times did not worke them of themselues but were onely god passiue instruments in this manner when the lord ended by them to worke any miracle they receiued from him at the same time an extraordinarie amp speciall instinct whereby they were mooued to attempt the worke they therefore yeelded themselues to the present motion of god spirit to be his instruments onely in the dispensation of the worke but the sole author and producer of the miracle was god himselfe and in this case the very manhood of our sauiour christ considered apart from his godhead had no power of it selfe but was onely the instrument of his godhead whensoeuer it pleased him in that kinde to manifest the same wherefore to ascribe this vertue to the crosse beeing a creature or the worke of a creature is to communicate the incommunicable power of the creator to it which is plaine blasphemie iv the fourth remedie is the vsing of hallowed things as hallowed graines salt water bread images specially the image of agnus dei ans hallowed creatures are in truth vnhallowed superstitions for euery creature is sanctified by the word and prayer tim by the word when god in his word commands vs to vse it for some ende and by prayer when we giue thanks for giuing the creature and withall desire his blessing in the vse thereof now let any papists shew me one letter or sillable in all the booke of god commanding the vse of a creature for any such ende they affirme indeede that elisha wrought miracles by hallowed salt for by it he cured the bitter water king but the prophet vsed not hallowed but common salt and that not ordinarily but onely then as a means wherby to worke a miracle it was therefore powerfull in his hands because for the doing thereof he had power and warrant from god extraordinarily and it cannot be so in any other which haue not the same gift v the fift and last remedie is exorcisine which is an adiuring and commanding the deuill in the name of god to depart from the partie possessed and cease to molest him any more this meanes was vsed by our sauiour christ himselfe and after him by his apostles and other beleeuers in the time of the primitiue church when the gift of working miracles was in force but in these daies a i said before that gift is ceased and also the promise of power annexed to the vse of adjuration and therefore the means thereof must needs cease and for an ordinarie man now to command the deuill in such sort is meere presumption and a practise of sorcerie i doubt not but in this last age of the world and among vs also this sinne of witchcraft ought as sharply to be punished as in former times and all witches beeing thoroughly conuicted by the magistrate ought according to the law of moses to be put to death for proofe hereof consider these reasons first this law of moses flatly enioyneth all man in all ages without limitation of circumstances not to suffer the witch to liue and hereupon i gather that it must stand the same both now and for euer to the worlds ende patrons of witches except against this holding that it was a iudiciall law which continued but for a time amp concerned onely the nation of the iewes and is now ceased but i take the contrarie to be the truth and that vpon these grounds i those iudiciall lawes whose penaltie is death because they haue in the a perpetuall equitie and doe serue to maintaine some morall precept are perpetuall the iewes indeede had some lawes of this kind whose punishments were temporall and they lasted onely for a certaine time but the penaltie of witchcraft beeing death by god appointment and the in licting of that punishment seruing to maintaine the equitie of the three first morall precepts of the first table which cannot be kept vnlesse this lawe be put in execution it must necessarily follow that it is in that regard morall and binds vs and shall in like sort bind all man in all ages as well as the iewes themselues to whome it was at that time personally directed ii euery iudiciall law that hath in it the equitie of the law of nature is perpetuall but the law of punishing the witch by death is such for it is a principle of the law of nature holden for a grounded truth in all country amp kingdomes among all people in euery age that the traytour who is an enemie to the state and rebelleth against his lawful prince should be put to death now the most notorious traytour and rebell that can be is the witch for shee renounceth god himselfe the king of kings shee leaues the societie of his church and people shee bindeth her selfe in league with the deuill and therfore if any offender among man ought to suffer death for his fact much more ought shee and that of due desert the second reason for the proofe of the point in hand is this according to moses lawe euery idolater was to be stoned to death deut if there be found any among you that hath gone and serued other god as the sun the moone or any of the hoast of heauen if the thing vpon enquirie be found to be true and certen thou shalt bring them forth vnto thy gates whether it be man or woman and shalt stone them with stones till they die now this is the very case of a witch shee renounceth the true god and maketh choice to serue the deuill shee is therefore a grosse idolater and her punishment must be suitable it is alledged by the fauourers of the contrarie part that peter denied christ and yet was not put to death i answer there is great difference betweene peters deniall of christ and witches denying of god peters deniall was vpon infirmitie and in hast the witch denieth god vpon knowledge and deliberation wittingly and willingly againe peter did not vpon the deniall betake himselfe to the deuill but turned vnto christ againe which he testified by his heartie and speedie repentance but witches denie god and betake themselues to the deuill of their own accord as is manifest euen by their own confessions at their arraignments the third reason euery seducer in the church whose practise was to draw man from the true god to the worship of idols though it were a mans owne son or daughter wife or friend by the peremptorie degree and commandement of god was at no hand to be spared or pitied but the hand of the witnesse first and then the hands of all the people must be vpon him to kill him deut if this be so no witches connicted ought to escape the sword of the magistrate for they are the most notorious seducers of all other when they be once intangled in the deuills league they labour to invre their dearest f iends and posteritie in their cursed and abominable practi es that they may be the more easily drawne into the same consederacy wherewith they theselues are vnited to satan i might here alleadge that they deserue death because many of them be murtherers but i stand not vpon that instance because i hold in the generall that witches are not to be suffered to liue though they doe no hurt either to man or other creatures and that by vertue of moses law onely for their leagues sake whereby they become rebells to god idolaters and seducers as now hath beene shewed notwithstanding all that hath beene said many things are brought in defence of them by such as be their friends and wel illers first it is saide that the hurt that is done comes not from the witch but from the deuill he deserues the blame because it is his worke and she is not to die for his sinne ans let it be granted that the witch is not the author of the euill that is done yet shee is a confederate and partner with the deuill in the fact and so the law takes hold on her see it in a familiar comparison a company of man conspire together in a robberie by common consent some stand in open place to espie out the bootie and to giue the watchword others are set about the passage priuily to rush vpon the man and to spoile him of his goods in this case what saith the law the parties that gaue the watchword though they did nothing to the man yet beeing accessories and abettors to the robberie by consent they are theeues and liable to condemnation and exequution as well as the principalls euen so stands the case with the witch in the working of wonders and in all mischieous practises he or she is partaker with the deuill by consent of couenant the witch onely vseth the watchword in some charme or otherwise and doth no more the deuill vpon notice giuen by the charme takes his opportunitie and works the mischeife he is the principall agent but the other yeeldeth helpe and is rightly liable to punishment the reason is because if the deuill were not stirred vp and prouoked by the witch he would neuer do so much hurt as he doth he had neuer appeared in samuels likenes had he not beene solicited by the witch of endor he would not haue caused counterfeit serpents and frogges to appeare in egypt but for ian es and iambres and other inchanters and in this age there would not in likelihood be so much hurt amp hinderance procured vnto man and other creatures by his meanes but for the instigation of ill disposed persons that haue fellowship and societie with him againe they obiect that witches conuicted either repent or repent not if they repent then god pardoneth their sinne and why should not the magistrate as well saue their body amp let them liue as god doth their soules if they doe not repent then it is a dangerous thing for the magistrate to put them to death for by this meanes he kills the bodie amp casts the soule to hell ans all witches iudicially amp lawfully conuicted ought to haue space of repentance granted vnto them wherein they may be instructed and exhorted and then afterward executed for it is possible for the to be saued by god mercie though they haue denied him secondly the magistrate must execute iustice vpon malefactors lawfully conuicted whether they repent or not for god approoueth the iust execution of iudgement vpon man without respect to their repentance neither must their impenitencie hinder the execution of iustice when the people of israel had committed idolatry in worshipping the golden calfe moses did not expect their repentance amp in the meane while forbeare the punishment but he and the leuites presently tooke their swords and slue them and the lord approoued their course of proceeding exod when zimri an israelite had committed fornication with cozbi a midianitish woman phineas in zeale of god glorie executed iudgment vpon them both without any respect vnto their repentance numb and is therefore commended psalm war are a worthie ordinance of god and yet no prince could euer attempt the same lawfully if euery souldier in the field should stay the killing of his enemie vpon expectation of his repentance and whereas they say that by executing an impenitent witch the magistrate casteth away the soule we must know that the nde of execution by the magistrate is not the damnation of the malefactors soule but that sinne might be punished that others may beware of the like crimes and offences and that the wicked may be taken away from among god people but some witches there be that can not be conuicted of killing any what shall become of them ans as the killing witch must die by another lawe though he were no witch so the healing and harmelesse witch must die by this law though he kill not onely for couenant made with satan for this must alwaies be remembred as a conclusion that by witches we vnderstand not those onely which kill and torment but all diuiners charmers iuglers all vvizzards commonly called wise man and wise woman yes whosoeuer doe any thing knowing what they doe which cannot be effected by nature or article and in the same number we reckon all good vvitches which doe no hurt but good which doe not spoile and destroy but saue and deliuer all these come vnder this sentence of moses because they deny god and are consederates with satan by the lawes of england the thiefe is executed for stealing and we thinke it iust and profitable but it were a thousand times better for the land if all vvi ches but specially the blessing witch might suffer death for the theife by his stealing and the hurtfull inchanter by charming bring hinderance and hurt to the body and goods of meni but these are the right hand of the deuill by which he taketh and destroyeth the soules of man men doe commonly hate and spit at the damnifying sorcerer as vnworthie to liue among them whereas the other is so deare vnto them that they hold themselues and their country blessed that haue him among them they flie vnto him in necessitie they depend vpon him as their god and by this meanes thousands are caried away to their finall confusion death therefore is the iust and deserued portion of the good witch

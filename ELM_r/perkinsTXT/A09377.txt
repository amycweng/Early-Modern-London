christian oeconomie is a doctrine of the right ordring of a familie the onely rule of ordering the family is the written word of god by it dauid resolued to gouerne his house whe he saith i will walke in the vprightnesse of my heart in the midst of my house psalm and salomon affirmeth that through wisdome an house is builded and with vnderstanding it is established prou a familie is a naturall and simple societie of certaine persons hauing mutuall relation one to another vnder the priuate gouernement of one these persons must be at the least three because two cannot make a societie and aboue three vnder the same head there may be a thousand in one familie as it is in the households of princes and man of state in the world a family for the good estate of it selfe is bound to the performance of two duties one to god the other to it selfe the dutie vnto god is the priuate worship and seruice of god which must be established and setled in euery family and the reasons hereof are these first because this duty standeth by the expresse commandement of god who by his apostle willeth man to pray ery where lifting vp pure hands without rath or doubting tim againe it is confirmed by the cu ome and practise of holy man in their mes i know saith the lord touching abraham that he will commaund his sonnes and his household after him that hey keepe the way of the lord to doe righ eousnesse and iudgement that the lord may bring vpon abraham that which he hath spoken to him en to the same purpose speaketh ioshua if it seeme euill vnto you to serue the lord chuse this day whom yee will serue whether the god whom your fathers serued that were beyond the floud or the god of the amorites in whose land ye dwell but i and my house will serue the lord iosh and cornelius is reported to haue been a deuout man and one that feared god with all his household act thirdly common reason and equitie sheweth it to be a necessarie dutie for the happie and prosperous estate of the familie which consisteth in the mutuall loue and agreement of the man and wife in the dutifull obedience of children to their parents and in the faithfull seruice of servant to their masters wholly dependeth vpon the grace and blessing of god and this blessing is annexed to his worship for tim godlinesse hath the promises of this life and the life to come psalm except the lord builde the house they labour in vaine that builde except the lord keepe the citie the keeper watcheth in vaine verse it is in vaine for you to rise early and to lie downe late and eate the bread of sorrow but he will surely giue rest to his beloued verse beholde children are the inheritance of iehouah and the fruite of the wombe his rewarde psalm blessed is euery one that feareth the lord and walketh in his waies verse when thou eatest the labours of thy hands thou shalt be blessed and it shall bee well with thee verse thy wife shall be as the fruitefull vine vpon the sides of thy house and thy children like oliue plants round about thy table verse yes thou shalt see thy childrens children and peace vpon israel sam i prayed saith hannah for this childe and the lord hath giuen mee my desire which i asked of him the household seruice of god hath two parts the first is a conference vpon the word of god for the edification of all the members thereof to eternall life the second is inuocation of the name of god with giuing of thankes for his benefits both these are commended in the scriptures deut these words which i command thee this day shall be in thy heart verse and thou shalt whet them vpon thy children amp talke of the whe thou tariest in thine house amp as thou walkest by the way and when thou liest downe and when thou risest vp verse when thy son shall aske thee in time to come saying what meane these testimonies and ordinances and lawes which the lord our god hath commanded you verse then thou shalt say vnto thy son we were pharaohs bondme in egypt but the lord brought vs out of egypt with a mightie hand verse therefore the lord hath commanded vs to do all these ordinaces amp to fear the lord our god psalm the foole hath said in his heart there is no god v they cal not vpo god the times of this seruice are these the morning in which the familie comming together in one place is to call vpon the name of the lord before they begin the workes of their callings the euening also is another time to be vsed in prayer because the familie hath seene the blessing of god vpon their labours the day before and now the time or rest draweth on in which euery one is to commend his body and soule into the protection of the lord for no man knoweth what shall befall him before he rise again neither knoweth any whether euer he shal rise againe or not it is therefore a desperate boldnesse without praying to go to rest besides this there be other times also wherein to performe this dutie as before and after meales for meats and drinkes are blessed to the receiuers by the word and prayer tim whatsoeuer god hath created is good neither is any thing to be refused if it be taken with thankesgiuing for it is sanctified by the word of god and prayer now these times the word of god approueth deut thou shalt talke of them when thou liest downe aud when thou risest vp psalm euening and morning and at noone i will pray and make a noise and he wil heare my voice psalm it is in vaine to rise earely and to lie downe late and eate the bread of sorrow except the lord vouchsafe a blessing who will surely giue rest to his beloued to these may sometimes be added the exercise of fasting which is as occasio serueth to be vsed both publikely amp priuately especially when they of the familie be therunto called by some present or imminent calamitie hest go and assemble all the iewes that are found in shusan and fast yee for mee and eate not nor drinke in three daies day nor night i also and my maids will fast likewise and so will i go in to the king which is not according to the law and if i perish i perish zachar and in that day shall there be a great mourning in ierusalem and the land shall bewaile euery familie apart the family of the house of dauid apart and their wiues apart the family of the house of nathan apart and their wiues apart ampc wherefore those families wherein this seruice of god is performed are as it were little churches yes euen a kind of paradise vpon earth and for this purpose s paul writing to philemon greeteth the church that is in his house philem and in like manner he sendeth salutations to the church of corinthian from aquila and priscilla and the church which was in their house corinthian on the otherside where this dutie of god seruice is not vsed but either for the most part or altogether neglected a man may tearme those families no better then company of prophane and gracelesse atheists who as they deny god in their harts so they are knowne by this note that they doe not call vpon the name of the lord psalm yes such families are fitly compared to an heard of swine which are alwaies feeding vpon the maste with greedinesse but neuer looke vp to the hand that beateth it downe nor to the tree from whence it falleth the other dutie concerning the house it selfe is that euery member in the familie according to their abilitie employ themselues in some honest and profitable businesse to maintaine the temporall estate and life of the whole gen in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread till thou returne to the earth for out of it wast thou taken for dust thou article and to dust shalt thou returne corinthian let euery man abide in the same vocation wherein he was called now if any one in the familie starteth aside out of his calling and inticeth another to idolatry he is to be reuealed deut and againe their case is very fearefull that do nothing in their houses but go finely and faire daintily from day to day this is the blacke marke that the scripture sets vpon the rich glutton luke there was a certaine rich man which was cloathed in purple aud fine linen and fared deliciously euery day a familie is distinguished into sundry combinations or couples of persons a couple is that wherby two persons standing in mutuall relation to each other are combined together as it were in one and of these two the one is alwaies higher and beareth rule the other is lower and yeeldeth subiection couples are of two sorts principall or lesse principall the principall is the combination of maried folkes and these are so termed in respect of mariage mariage is the lawful coniunction of the two maried persons that is of one man and one woman into one flesh so was the first institution of mariage gen which is expounded by our sauiour christ matth therfore they are no more two but one flesh and also by paul ephesian for this cause shall a man leaue father and mother and shall cleaue vnto his wife as two boords are ioyned together with glue and they which were two shall be one flesh wherefore this is an eternal law of mariage that two and not three or foure shall be one flesh and for this cause the fathers who had many wiues and concubines it may be that through custome they sinned of ignorance yet they are not in any wise to be excused mariage of it selfe is a thing indifferent and the kingdome of god stands no more in it then in meats and drink and yet it is a state in it selfe farre more excellent then the condition of single life for first it was ordained by god in paradise aboue and before all other states of life in adams innocencie before the fall againe it was instituted vpon a most serious and solemne consultation among the three persons in the holy trinitie genes let vs make man in our image according to our likenesse and let them rule ouer ampc gen iehouah elohim said it is not good that the man should be himselfe alone i will make him an helpe meete for him thirdly the manner of this coniunction was excellent for god ioyned our first parents adam and eue together immediately fourthly god gaue a large blessing vnto the estate of mariage saying increase and multiplie and fill the earth lastly mariage was made amp appointed by god himselfe to be the fountaine and seminarie of all other sorts amp kinds of life in the common wealth and in the church now if mankind had continued in that vprightnes and integritie which it had by creation the state of single life had been of no price and estimation amongst man neither should it haue had any place in the world without great contempt of god ordinance and blessing neuerthelesse since the fall to some man who haue the gift of continencie it is in many respects farre better then mariage yet not simplie but only by accident in regard of sundrie calamities which came into the world by sin for first it freeth a man from many and great cares of houshold affaires againe it maketh him much more fit amp disposed to meditate of heauenly things without distraction of mind besides that when dangers are either present or imminent in matters belonging to this life the single person is in this case happie because he and his are more secure and safe then others be who are in maried state corinthian therefore i say to the vnmaried and widowes it is good for them if they abide euen as i do verse i suppose then this to be good for the present necessitie i meane that it is good for a man so to be verse but if thou takest a wife thou sinnest not and if a virgin marrie she sinneth not neuerthelesse such shall haue trouble in the flesh verse and i would haue you without care the end of mariage is fourefold the first is procreation of children for the propagation and continuance of the seed and posteritie of man vpon the earth gen bringforth fruit multiplie fill the earth and subdue it genes tim the second is the procreation of an holy seed wherby the church of god may be kept holy and chaste and there may alwaies be a holy company of man that may worship and serue god in the church from age to age malach and did not he make one yet had hee abundance of spirit and wherefore one because he sought a godly seed the third is that after the fall of mankind it might be a soueraigne meanes to auoid fornication and consequently to subdue and slake the burning lusts of the flesh corinthian neuerthelesse for the auoiding of fornication let euery man haue his wife and euery woman haue her husband verse but if they cannot abstaine let them marrie for it is better to marrie then to burne and for this cause some schoolemen doe erre who hold that the secret comming together of man and wife cannot be without sinne vnlesse it be done for procreation of children lombard the master of the sentences saith the contrarie namely that mariage before the fall was only a dutie but now since the fall it is also remedie the fourth end is that the parties married may thereby performe the duties of their callings in better and more comfortable manner prou the heart of her husband trusteth her and hee shall haue no need of spoile verse she seeketh wooll and flaxe and laboureth cheerefully with her hands mariage is free to al orders and sorts of man without exception euen to those that haue the gift of contimencie but for them which cannot abstaine it s by the expresse commandement of god necessarie hebr mariage is honorable amongst all man and the bed vndefiled corinthian but if they cannot abstaine let them marrie by which it appeareth to be a cleare case that the commandement of the pope of rome whereby he forbiddeth mariage of certaine persons as namely of clergie man is meerely diabolicall for so writeth the apostle tim the spirit speaketh euidently that in the latter times some shall depart fro the faith and shall giue heed vnto spirits of error and doctrines of diuels verse forbidding to marrie but against this doctrine sundrie things are alleaged obiect the apostle commandeth the married among the corinthes to abstaine with consent for a time that they might giue themselues to fasting and praier corinthian i answere that paul speakes not in that place of daily and common seruice of god in prayer but of the solemne and extraordinarie exercise therof which was ioyned with fasting and abstinence in common dangers and calamities obiect corinthian he that is vnmarried careth for the things of the lord how he may please the lord but the married person careth for the things of the world answer the place is not generally to be vnderstood of all but indefinitely of those married persons that are carnall and fleshly and he that is married is to bee so carefull for the things of the world as that he ought and may haue also a special regard of those things that concerne god and his kingdome obiect tim the yonger widowes saith the apostle will marrie hauing damnation because they haue broken the first faith answer by the first faith paul vnderstandeth that promise and vow which they made vnto christ when they were baptised and they are there said to begin to waxe wanton against christ by denying or renouncing that faith and not otherwise obiect he that doth earnestly and from his heart craue the gift of continencie god will giue it him and therfore he need not marrie answer the gifts of god are of two sorts some are generall some are proper generall gifts are such as god giueth generally to all and these may be obtained if they be asked according to god word lawfully iam if any of you lacke wisedome let him aske it of god who giueth to all man liberally and reprocheth no man and it shall bee giuen him verse but let him aske in faith and wauer not proper gifts are those which are giuen only to some certaine man of which sort is the gift of continencie and such like which though they bee often and earnestly asked yet they are seldome or neuer granted vnto some man as appeareth in pauls example who being buffetted by satan saith of himselfe for this thing i besought the lord thrice that it might depart from me but he said vnto me my grace is sufficient for thee corinthian marriage hath two distinct parts the first is the beginning the second the accomplishment or consummation thereof the beginning is the contract or espousals the end or accomplishmet is the solemne manifestation of the contract by that which properly we call mariage deut what man is there that hath betrothed a wife and hath not taken her let him go and returne againe vnto his house lest he die in battell and another man take her matth when his mother marie was betrothed to ioseph before they came together she was found with child of the holy ghost betweene the contract and marriage there ought to bee some certaine space or distance of time the reasons whereof may be these first a businesse of so great importance as this is would not be rashly or vnaduisedly attempted but should rather be done by degrees in processe of time according to that saying not so ancient as true diu deliberandum quod s mel sta uendum actions of weight before resolution require mature deliberation secondly that during such a space inquirie may be made whether there be any iust cause which may hinder the consummation of marriage considering that before the parties come and conuerse together what is amisse may be remedied and amended which to do afterward will be too late thirdly in these cases persons espoused must haue regard of honestie as well as of necessitie not presently vpon the contract seeking to satisfie their own fleshly desires after the manner of bruit beast but proceeding therein vpon mature deliberation the contract is a mention or mutuall promise of future mariage before fit and competent iudges and witnesses the best manner of giuing this promise is to make it in ver is de in words touching the present time and simplie without any exception or condition expressed or conceiued for by this meanes it comes to passe that the bond is made the surer and the ground or foundation of future mariage the better laid and hence alone it is that the persons betrothed in scripture are termed man and wife iacob speaking of rahel who was only betrothed vnto him saith to laban giue me my wife genes deut if a maid bee betrothed to a husband and a man find her in the towne and lie with her then shall yee bring them both out vnto the gates of the citie and shall stone them with stones to death the maid because she cried not being in the citie and the man because hee hath humbled his neighbours wife matth ioseph feare not to take mary thy wife now if the promise bee vttered in words in futurum for time to come it doth not precisely bind the parties to performance for example if one of them saith to the other n i will take thee ampc and not n i do take thee ampc by this forme of speech the match is not made but only promised to bee made afterward but if on the other side it be said n i do take thee and not i will take thee by these termes the mariage at that very instant is begun non de facto de ure not in regard of fact yet in regard of right and intrest which the parties haue each in another in deed and in truth and this is the common opinion of the learned yet notwithstanding if the parties contracting shall say each to other i will take thee to ampc with intention to bind themselues at the present the bond is in conscience precisely made before god and so the contract is indeed made de praesenti for the present time before god true it is that he which standeth to his promise made as much as in him lieth doth well yet if the promise hath or conceiueth some iust cause why hee should afterward change his purpose the contract expressed in termes for time to come though it were formerly made amp confirmed by oath must notwithstanding giue place to the contract made for time present those espousals which are made vpon condition which is honest possible and belonging to mariage doe cease or depend so far forth as the condition annexed ceaseth or dependeth for example if the one partie promiseth to marry the other vpon codition that his or her kinsman will yeeld consent to the match or vpon condition of a dowrie that shee shall bring vnto him sutable to her education and the familie whereof she commeth these conditions being kept or not kept the promise doth likewise stand or not stand but those conditions which are necessarily vnderstood or which may certainly be kept and come to passe do neither hinder nor suspend marriage as this i promise thee mariage if i liue or i promise to marie thee if the sun rise to morrow againe conditions that are either impossible or dishonest are not to bee accounted as promises annexed jn sauorem matrimony in way of marriage of which sort are these i will be thy wife if thou willt take vnto thee wings and flie or if thou wilt bring an vntimely birth furthermore if the parties betrothed do lie together before the condition though honest amp appertaining to mariage be performed then the contract for time to come is without further controuersie sure and certaine for where there hath been a carnall vse of each others bodie it is alwaies presupposed that a mutuall consent as touching mariage hath gone before for the making of a cotract two things are requisite first the choice amp then the consent of the parties choice is an enquirie after persons mariageable persons mariageable are such as be fit and able for the maried state this fitnes or abilitie is knowne and discerned by certaine signes which are either essentiall to the contract or accidentall an essentiall signe is that without which the contract in hand becomes a meere nullitie and of this sort there are principally fiue the first is the distinction of the sex which is either male or female the male is man of a superiour sexe fit for procreation the female is woman of an inferiour sexe fit to conceiue and beare children corinthian the man ought not to couer his head for as much as he is the image and glorie of god but the woman is the glorie of the man tim i permit not the woman to teach neither to vsurpe authoritie ouer the man but to be in silence by this distinction is condemned that vnnatural and monstrous sin of vncleannes betweene parties of the same sexe commonly termed sodomie as also the confusion of the species kinds of creatures when one kind commits filthinesse and abomination with another the second signe is the iust amp lawf ll distance of blood distance of blood is then iust and lawful when neither of the persons that are to be married do come neare to the kindred of their flesh or to the flesh of their flesh for so the scripture speaketh leuit no man shall come neare to any of the flesh of his flesh or to the ebr kindred of his flesh where it is to be obserued that by a mans flesh is meant that substance which is of himselfe or whereof himselfe consisteth and by the flesh of his flesh that which next and immediately issueth out of that flesh whereof he consisteth whereupon it followeth that the touching or comming neare of flesh to flesh is not spoken of strangers but of those only that are of kindred kindred is of two sorts consanguinitie or affinitie kindred in consanguinitie are those which issue from out amp the same common blood or stocke and there be certaine degrees whereby kinsmen of this sort are distinguished one from another a degree is a generation or descent betweene two persons that are of the same blood for one person cannot make a degree vnlesse he be considered relatiuely in regard of generation now many degrees continued or deriued from one and the same head do make a line and a line is twofold the right line or the ouerthwart comonly termed collaterall in the right line looke how manie persons there are so many degrees there be that only excepted which vpon occasion offered is in question and from which we begin the account heere ioseph is distant three degrees from abraham iacob two isaac one or the first the right line is either ascending or descending the right line ascending is the race of all the ancestors and it hath sundrie degrees of the first whereof is the father and the mother of the second the grand father both by the father and mothers side that is the father of my father and the father of my mother and the grand mother that is to say my fathers and my mothers mother of the third is the great grand father or the father of my grand father and the great grand mother or the mother of my grand father of the fourth is the great grand fathers father and the great grand fathers or grand mothers mother of the fift is the great grand fathers grand father amp the great grand fathers or great grand mothers grand mother of the sixt is the great great grand fathers grand father amp the great great grand fathers or great great grand mothers grand mother the right line descending is the race of a mans owne posteritie and that also hath sundrie degrees the first wherof is the son and the daughter the second the nephew and the neece the third the nephewes son and the neeces daughter the fourth is the nephewes nephew or the son in the fourth degree of lineall descent amp the neeces neece or the daughter in the same degree of descent the fift is hee and she that are three lineall descents from the childs child and so are the rest in their order by what names soeuer they be called and knowne now in this right line whether ascending or descending the person of whom the case or question is moued commeth neere to the kindred of his flesh and therefore mariages in this line are prohibited infinitly without any limitation so as if adam himselfe were now aliue he could not marry by the law of god because hee should come neare to the kindred of his owne flesh as moses speaketh the reason hereof is because in the right line superiours and inferiours are to each other as parents and children and the kindred betweene parents amp children being the first and nearest of all other their coniuction in marriage must needs bee most vncleane and repugnant vnto nature the collaterall or crooked line is that which walketh by the sides of the right line whether ascending or descending in the row of the kindred and it is either vnequall or equall the vnequall is that whereby the person in question and his kinsman are vnequally distant from the common stocke or head of the kindred and in this line looke how many degrees the kinsman that is furthest off from the common stock is distant from the same so many is he and his kinsman in question distant one from the other heere laban being remoued furthest off to wit three degrees from the common stock thare is likewise three degrees distant fro abraham his great vnckle and abraham so many from him furthermore kinsmen in this line are of two sorts some are superiours to the person in question some are inferiours to him superiours are such as are a kinne to his father and mother of some side and that either nearer or further off those that are of neare kin to them bee these i the vncle of the fathers side or the fathers brother the aunt of the fathers side or fathers sister the vncle of the mothers side or the mothers brother the aunt of the mothers side or the mothers sister ii the great vncle or grand fathers brother the great aunt or grand fathers sister the great vncle or grand mothers brother and the great aunt or grand mothers sister iii the great vncle by the fathers side or great grand fathers brother and the great aunt by the fathers side or great grand fathers sister the great vncle by the mothers side or the great grand mothers brother and the great aunt by the mothers side or the great grand mothers sister iv the great grand vncle by the fathers side or great grand fathers fathers brother and the great grand aunt by the same side or the great grand fathers fathers sister the great grand vncle by the mothers side or great grand mothers mothers brother and the great grand aunt by the same side or the great grad mothers mothers sister now these in regard of their inferiours are in stead of parents and therefore do come neare to the kindred of their flesh those superiours which are of kindred to parents on the one side a farre off are these i the son and daughter of the great vncle or aunt by the fathers side or of the great vncle or aunt by the mothers side ii the nephew and neece of the great vncle or aunt by the fathers side or of the great vncle or aunt by the mothers side neare to the cozin germane and these as they stand in comparison with their inferiours doe not come neare to the kindred of their flesh the equall collaterall line is that whereby kinsmen are equally distant from their head kinsmen of this line are i whole brothers that is brothers by the same father and mother or halfe brothers that is brother by the same father but not by the same mother againe whole sisters by the same father or mother or halfe sisters by one of them and not by both ii the brothers children or cousin germans that is the vncles son or daughters or the aunts sonnes or daughters the sisters children or cousin germans that is the aunts sonnes or daughters which are the children of two sisters iii the cousin german the son of the great vncle by the fathers or mothers side and the cousin german the son of the great aunt by the fathers or mothers side the cousin german the daughter of the great vncle by the fathers or mothers side and the cousin german the daughter of the great aunt by the same sides in this line looke how many degrees the partie in question is remoued from the common stocke by so many twice told is he remoued from his kinsman in question put the case betweene bethuel and isaac as in this example heere bethuel being two degrees remoued from thare is foure degrees distant from isaac now he that is in the second degree of this line comes neare to the kindred of his flesh and for that cause the mariages of brother and sisters are unlawful and forbidden but against this sundrie things are alledged obiect the son of adam who were the first brother in the world married their sisters marriages therefore in this degree may seeme to bee lawful answer the case of those persons in those times was a case of necessitie which could not be auoided and therupon was warranted by diuine dispensation for god had giuen them his owne expresse commandement in this behalfe beare fruits and multiplie gen besides that there were then no other woman in the world by whom they might haue issue and posteritie but only by their sisters whereupon it is manifest that god will was to permit them to take euen their sisters to their wiues but now out of this speciall dispensation from god such matching is vtterly unlawful being an apparent breach of another expresse commandement giuen afterward by god himselfe leuit to this purpose saith augustine in way of answere to the example propounded the practise of those first times then backed by vrgent nenessitie the more ancient it was the more damnable it proued afterward when it was restrained by god commandement obiect sarah was abrahams sister and yet abraham tooke her to wife gen yet in very deed she is my sister for she is the daughter of my father but not the daughter of my mother and shee is my wife gen abraham and nahor tooke them wiues and the name of abrahams wife was sarah answer touching this instance there are sundrie opinions the iewes doe grant thus much that she was called by a name common to all kinsfolke of that sexe to wit a sister yet indeed shee was abrahams neece the sister of lot and the daughter of haran abrahams brother which moses elsewhere calleth iischa genes others thinke that shee was daughter in law to thare abrahams father because abraham himselfe saith she is the daughter of my father not of my mother others are of opinion that she was harans daughter in law and after his death was translated into the family of terah her grand father who was also in ste d of her father being dead and thence shee was termed his daughter now howsoeuer in this varietie of iudgements it is hard to find certaintie of truth yet this is out of doubt that god in those daies tolerated many things which notwithstanding he did not altogether approue obiect sam thamar saies to her brother amnon speake i pray thee to the king and he will not denie mee vnto thee ans the speech of thamar is not simplie to be taken as if she desired that which she said or as if it were lawful to be done which she wished him to do but only that she sought to put him off by giuing him this counsell in respect of her owne deliuerance from that present danger wherein shee was or at least it way be said that she erroniously supposed it was lawful for the king to grant such a sute if it had bin made vnto him by her brother amnon whether way soeuer this speech bee taken there can no such thing bee gathered thence as is pretended now out of the second degree of the equal collateral line it should seeme that those who are ioyned one to another in mariage do not touch the kindred of their flesh and therefore the law of god forbiddeth not cosobrines or cousin germans that is brothers and sisters children to marrie yes if examples be of force for this purpose the scripture approueth such mariages for thus it is written that iacob married rahel the daughter of laban his mothers brother genes againe that mahlah tirzah and hoglah milcah and noah the daughters of zelophehad were married vnto their fathers brothers sonnes numb and othniel the son of kenaz the cousin of caleb tooke kiriath sepher and hee gaue him acsah his daughter to wife ios howbeit in this case the rule of the apostle is to be followed that nothing be done euen in things that are otherwise lawful whereby a mans brother may stumble or bee offended or made weake rom wherefore it is conuenient that such mariages should not be because sometimes they may giue offence in regard of the law of the magistrate and because they come somewhat neare to the bonds and termes of blood and stocke which god hath set downe in his word augustine in his booke de ciuitate dei chap saith to this purpose experti autem sumus ampc that is we haue found by experience that in regard of that neerenesse of blood which cousin germans haue vnto the degrees of brothers and sisters how rarely custome hath admitted those mariages which were warrantable by lawes because the law of god hath not forbidden them nor as yet the law of man neuerthelesse the practise lawful in it selfe was forborne the rather because it came neare to that which was unlawful and therfore mariage with the cousin german seemed in a manner to be marriage with a mans own brother or sister ampc howbeit there is no question but in these times it hath been well prouided by lawes that such mariages should not be vndertaken for as the multiplication of alliance is hindered thereby so this inconuenience also groweth from them that friendship and loue which is procured by affinitie betweene man that are strangers cannot be enlarged and encreased where man goe not out of the limits and termes of their owne blood yes there is naturally in man a commendable measure of shamefastnesse whereby vpon consideration of nearenesse in blo d hee acknowledgeth a due debt of modestie and honor to his next kindred and consequently estraineth himself in regard of them from he occasions and actions of concupiscence whereunto hee is inclinable in respect of others and hence it is that generally the modestie that ought to be in those which intend mariage auoideth as much as may be these and such like coniunctions the same is the iudgement of ambrose in one of his epistles to his friend paternus wherin he disswadeth him fro marrying his son with his cousin g rman vpon the grounds before alledged by augustine adding this withall that though it were in it selfe lawful being no where forbidden by god yet in sundrie respects being inexpedient it ought not to bee done according to the saying of the apostle all things are lawful for me but all things are not expedient but it is auouched to the contrarie that god by expresse law forbiddeth mariage with the aunt the fathers sister leuit and with the mothers sister verse and with the fathers brother wife which is also the aunt verse therefore by the law of proportion forbiddeth matching with the childr of these persons for in nature it is a ruled case if a man may not marrie th mother much lesse may he marrie the daughter answer the argument is faultie and concludes nothing to the purpose for there is not the same reason of both in the right line of consanguinitie those which are sisters to father and mother stand in the place and stead of parents and their nephewes and neeces are to them as children therefore mariages among them can stand by no law either of god of nature or by the positiue lawes of nation it is not so with cousin germans for hauing no such relation there is not in their mariages by the law of moses any discouerie of shame or breach of ciuil honestie the blessing of god vpon some of them mentioned in scripture as vpon iacob and rahel and such like doe euidently shew that they were lawful in themselues and pleasing vnto him and thus much touching kindred by blood or consanguinitie kindred in affinitie is that whereby the termes of two kindreds are brought into the societie of one and the same familie or whereby persons that are not of blood are by marriage allied each to other hence it is termed affinitie because it maketh an vnitie of termes in kindred which before were distant affinity or alliance groweth by mixtion or participation of blood in the coupling of man and wife together in lawful mariage for a bare and simple contract maketh not alliance betweene partie and partie properly but mariage after the contract finished and consummate againe the same alliance ceaseth and determineth vpon the death of either partie espoused or maried yet so as the prohibition of coniunction remaines and stands in force for the preseruation of publike honestie now there is a kind of resemblance and proportion betweene kindred of blood and kindred by mariage not only in regard of degrees and line but also in respect of the prohibition of degrees those that are of alliance are commonly reduced to these heads i the father in law or the husbands or wiues father the mother in law or the husbands or wiues mother ii the mothers husband or step father to them that come by another man the fathers wife or step mother to those that come by another woman iii the wiues fathers father or grand father and the wiues mothers mother or grand mother or the grand father and grand mother of the wife iv the son in law or daughters husband and the daughter in law or son wife v the neeces husband amp the nephewes wife vi the step son or son in law that is the son of a man by another wife or of a woman by another husband the step daughter or daughter in law that is the daughter of a man by another wife or of a woman by another husband vii the step son son or his son who comes of a man by another woman or of a woman by another ma and the step daughters daughter or her daughter who comes of a man by another woman or of the woman by another husband viii the husbads or wiues brother amp the husbads sister or brothers wife ix the sisters husband and the brothers wife concerning affinitie i propound these rules i looke in what degree a man is of consanguinity to ones wife in the same degree of affinitie hee is to the wiues husbad and cotrariwise for example heere if mark e iosephs wife be distant from esau iosephs vncle by the fathers side two degrees then also is ioseph himself distant from aaron the brother of eli his father in law two degrees if marie the wife be distant from her own father eli one degree and from her grand father samuel two then also is her husband distant from eli his father in law one degree and from samuel his wiues grand father two another example heere herod being in the first degree of consanguinitie with his brother philip herodias his brothers wife is in the first degree of affinitie to him ii rule cousins by mariage within the degrees both of the right and collaterall line doe come neere to the kindred of their flesh in the same manner that cousins by bloud doe in the same lines and the like degrees in both are forbidden therefore in the right line of affinitie it is as well vnlawful for the father in law to marrie the daughter in law or the son in law to marry the mother in law as it is for the father to marrie the daughter or the son the mother againe in the collaterall it is as vnlawful for the vncle by the mothers side to marrie the wife of his sisters son and so in other degrees as it is for him to match in the same degrees of cosanguinitie the reason is because in these lines as well as in those of consanguinitie superiours and inferiours are each to other as parents and children from hence amongst other things it may bee gathered that it is in no sort lawful for a man when his wife is dead to marrie her sister leuit thou shalt not discouer the shame of thy brothers wife for it is thy brothers shame and leuit the man that taketh his brothers wife committeth filthines because he hath vncouered his brothers shame against this doctrine it is obiected first that god commandeth not to take a wife with her sister during her life leuit in which place hee doth not simplie forbid a man to marry two sisters one after another but to marrie them both together and therefore after the wife is dead a man may marrie her sister ans the place is a flat prohibition of the sin of polygamie for to take a wife to her sister in the hebrew phrase is nothing else but to take two wiues one to another the like forme of speech is vsed otherwhere by moses as exo fiue curtaines shall bee coupled together the woman to her sister that is one to another and the other fiue curtaines shall be coupled the woman to her sister that is the one to the other ezech the foure beast were ioyned with their wings the woman to her sister that is the one to the other againe moses himselfe there alledgeth two reasons against polygamie the one is because the man is to loue cherish and comfort this wife whereas if he should take vnto him another besides her he should greatly vex his first lawful wife the other because by that meanes he should vncouer the shame of his wife that is he should play a very dishonest part with her to whom he was before lawfully married obiect the lord commanded by a speciall law that the brother in case his brother died without issue should take his wife and raise vp seede vnto him deut answer the words of moses are a speciall exception of a generall law propounded in leuit thou shalt not discouer the shame of thy brothers wife for it is thy brothers shame and they are peculiarly directed to the israelites vpon speciall cause that when the elder brother died without seed the name of the first borne might not be extinct but the familie might bee preserued in that name by raising vp of seed vnto him which being a priuiledge proper to the israelites vpon that speciall consideration it must not bee enlarged to any other sort of man whatsoeuer neither is the text to be vnderstood of cousins remoued only as some thinke but also of the next of the kindred by blood as appeareth plainly by the historie of ruth chap i verse ii in these words of naomi to her daughters in law turne againe my daughters for what cause will you go with me are there any moe sonnes in my wombe that they may bee your husbands turne againe my daughters go your way for i am too old to haue a husband ampc iii rule the wiues kinsman by blood is of affinitie to her husband only but vnto his kindred by blood the said kinsman hath no affinitie at all so on the contrarie it is true that though the husbands kinsman by blood be allied to his wife yet he hath no alliance to those that are kinsmen of blood vnto her the reason is because betweene the kindred of blood on the mans side and the kindred of blood on the womans side there is no affinitie for the prohibition of the degrees of affinitie hath force in those only which are the cause thereof and goeth no further now the cause being only in the married persons themselues the effect may not in reason be enlarged to them that are of the same blood with either of them from this rule it followeth that the kindred of both married persons by blood may lawfully match together the son in law may match with the daughter of his mother in law the father and the son by another wife may marrie the mother and the daughter two brothers may lawfully match with two sisters iv rule kindred of affinitie to the wife are also kindred of affinitie to her husband but how not properly but only after a sort and as it were of affinitie so on the contrarie kindred of alliance to the husband are as it were of alliance to his wife for example the wife of my father in law which is not my wiues owne mother but her step mother is as it were my mother in law for she is as it were of affinitie to me because she is indeed of affinitie to my wife those which are of affinitie only after a sort cannot conueniently match one with another and therefore the son in law may not marrie with his wiues step mother because being of affinitie to his wife shee is in stead of a mother in law to him neither may the daughter in law match with her husbands step father because hee is as it were a step father to her againe my sisters husband may not marry my brothers wife for they are after a sort brother and sister each to other the reason hereof is because the wife is holden in law a cuius nuptias in re non licet eius nec coniu is licet part of her husband and therfore if affinitie hinders mariage with one of the married couples it hindreth as well in the like case and respect mariage with the other and thus much touching the distance of blood which in the choice of persons fit for mariage is most necessarily to be obserued for in the chapter of leuiticus there are sixteene seuerall sorts of persons with whom mariage is forbidden the first is the mother the second is the step mother the thid the sister by the same father and mother the fourth the half sister by one of the parents only the fifth is the neece by the son the sixth the neece by the daughter the seuenth the fathers sister the eight the vncles that is the fathers brothers wife the ninth the mothers sister the tenth the daughter in law or son wife the eleuenth the brothers wife the twelfth the wiues mother the thirteenth the step daughter or the wiues daughter by another husbad or husbads daughter by a former wife the fourteenth is the step sonnes daughter that is his daughter who was the wiues son by another husbad the fifteenth the step daughters daughter the sixteenth is the wiues sister and not only these but all other answerable to them either in the same or like degree are by equall proportion forbidden to be had in mariage it is alledged that the prohibitions mentioned in that chapter are meerely mosaicall that is ceremoniall and therefore doe not bind vs now in the new testament answer it is a flat vntruth as shall appeare by these reasons first the cananites long before these lawes were giuen by moses to the israelites were grieuously afflicted for the breach and contempt of the same as may bee gathered by that which is written in the same chapter of leuiticus verse according to the workes of the land of canaan yee shall not do neither walke in their ordinances and verse you shall not defile your selues in any of these things for in all these the nation are defiled which i will cast out before you verse and the land is defiled therefore i will visite the wickednes thereof vpon it and the land shall vomit out her inhabitant secondly the prophets themselues after moses are wont to account these prohibitions not ceremonial but morall ezech in thee haue they discouered their fathers shame in thee haue they vexed her that was polluted in her flowers amos a man and his father will go in to a maid to prophane the name of my holinesse thirdly the same lawes are also vrged in the new testament wherin legal ceremonies were determined and had their end mark john said to herod it is not lawful for thee to haue thy brothers wife corinthian it is heard certainly that there is fornication among you and such fornication as is not once named among the gentiles that one should haue his fathers wife fourthly nature it selfe by proper instinct abhorreth such kind of coniunctions amp the prohibitions of them haue sufficient ground euen from her principles for to this purpose it is that not only the lawes of the romane emperours but also the ciuill canons and constitutions of man very skilfull in that kind haue in all ages expresly bin made against such persons as haue offended in those societies forbidden by the law of moses fiftly the lord himselfe hath denounced many and great punishments to be inflicted vpon the breach of the same lawes leuit the man that lieth with his fathers wife because hee hath vncouered his fathers shame they shall both die their blood shal be vpon them verse the man that lieth with his daughter in law they both shall die the death they haue wrought abomination their blood shall bee vpon them verse he that takes a wife and her mother committeth wickednesse they shall burne him and them with fire verse the man that taketh his sister his fathers daughter or his mothers daughter and seeth her shame and she seeth his shame it is villanie therefore they shall be cut off in the sight of their people verse the man that lieth with his fathers brothers wife and vncouereth his vncles shame they shall beare their iniquitie amp shall die childlesse deut a bastard shall not enter into the congregation of the lord euen to his tenth generation deut cursed be he that lieth with his fathers wife the third essential signe of a person mariageable is abilitie and fitnesse for procreation and this in an holy and modest sort is alwaies supposed to bee in the partie contracted vnlesse the cotrarie be manifestly knowne amp discerned by some apparent infirmitie in the bodie hence i gather that it is vnlawful to make a contract with such a person as is vnfit for the vse of mariage either by naturall constitution of bodie or by accident for example in regard of sicknesse or of frigiditie or of the palsie vncurable or lastly of the depriuation of the parts belonging to generation these and such like impediments are of force though a contract should alreadie be made yet to make it a meere nullitie considering that god maketh knowne his will in them that hee approoueth not of such espousals but would haue them to be dissolued againe that which is made betweene two persons that are impuberes vnder age is to bee holden and accounted as unlawful and though it should be done by consent or comandement of parents yet it is of no moment this alwaies remembred except it bee ratified by a new consent of the parties after they be come to age or that they in the meane time haue had priuate and carnall copulation one with another againe put the case two be espoused whereof the one is vnder age the other of full age the partie that is of full age ought to tarrie and expect the time wherein the issue of the espousals formerly made may bee manifested and the vnder aged may not break off consent either before or when they be come to perfect yeares but must rest in expectation of the accomplishment of the contract when hee or she shall be out of their minoritie the fourth essential signe is a sound and healthfull constitution of bodie free from diseases incurablie contagious whereupon it followeth that a promise of mariage made betweene those whereof the one hath a disease so lothsome as that the other vpon good ground cannot possiblie endure familiar societie and company with him though it do not wholly hinder the vse of the bodie is vtterly unlawful of this sort is the leprosie the frech poxe and such like for seeing there cannot be any matrimonial vse of them that are tainted with such contagious diseases without apparent danger of infecting each other and those also which haue societie with them and others yes and by this meanes the issue of their body growing of a corrupted seed are euen borne to perpetual miserie and to the great hurt and hinderance of the common wealth the case is plaine that such mariages cannot be vndertaken with good conscience now if the one party haue a disease though not contagious yet either incurable or so turpi lothsome as the other hath iust cause to abhor his company for example if he be sicke of a lethargie of the falling sicknes or such like diseases then though it be lawful to match with him because such a contract is not expressely forbidden neither is it apparantly hurtfull to the comon wealth yet is it not expedient because the disease being lothsome to the sound partie the mariage also will become vnprofitable and the partie in danger of breaking the commandemet of the morall law wherein god forbiddeth to commit adulterie the fifth essentiall signe of a person mariageable is freedome from mariage whereby both the parties which enter contract are so at libertie that neither the man hath in present another wife or is promised to another nor the woman hath another husband or is promised to another the reason is because god himselfe esteemeth that mariage only lawful wherein one man is ioyned to one woman and they both into one flesh amp consequently iudgeth it unlawful as for one man to haue more wiues so for one woman at the same time to haue more husbands hence it followeth that it is against the law of god and the first institution of mariage that a contract should bee made betweene such persons whereof the one is formerly betrothed to another for so long as the first promise stands in force the man can no more be betrothed to two woman then he may be the husband of two wiues because the spouse by the bond of her promise to the man becomes a wife and the man by the bond of his promise to the woman becomes an husband deut againe there can bee no sure making and consequently no mariage with such a one as either hath been diuorced without a sufficient cause or hath wrongfully forsaken and reiected a lawful mate before to this purpose saith our sauiour christ matth i say vnto you that whosoeuer shall put away his wife except it be for whoredome amp marieth another committeth adulterie and whosoeuer marrieth her which is diuorced committeth adulterie and saint paul corinthian but amp if she depart let her remaine vnmarried or be reconciled vnto her husband and let not the husband put away his wife hitherto i haue treated of essentiall markes which belong to the being of mariage now i come to those that are accidentall an accidentall marke of a person fit for mariage is that which belongeth not to the being but to the well being that is to the holines and puritie of that estate and of this sort there be three that are the principall the first is paritie or equality in regard of christian religion for in mariage there is a speciall care to be had that belieuers be matched with belieuers and christians with christians not belieuers with infidel or christians with pagan for the former sort are only and alwaies to be made and kept and the latter to be auoided yes inhibited by positiue lawes and constitutions the breach whereof in such cases is seuerely to be punished the neglect of this point was one principall cause of the destructio of the old world by the floud gen the son of god saw the daughters of man that they were faire and they tooke them wiues of all that they liked abraham obserued it in the mariage of isaac his son and for that purpose tooke an oath of his servant gen i will make thee sweare by the lord god of heauen and god of the earth that thou shalt not take a wife vnto my son of the daughters of the cananites among whom i dwell and in imitation of that holy example isaac also giues a charge vnto iacob his son that he should not take a wife of the daughters of canaan gen afterward there was an expresse law of god giuen by moses touching the gentiles that liued in that land exod beware that thou make not a couenant with the inhabitant of the land ampc verse and take of their daughters vnto thy sonnes and their daughters go a whoring after their god and make thy sonnes goe a whoring after their god and the same law was vrged by ezra the priest in his time ezra separate your selues from the people of the land and from the strange wiues lastly s paul exhorteth the corinthias corinthian be not vnequally yoked with the infidel and titus reiect him that is an heretike after once or twice admonition but suppose it falleth out that the espousals be past and that both parties at the first were belieuers or one of the only or that at first both were vnbelieuers and yet afterward one of them is conuerted to the faith or further admit that both were belieuers at the contract yet within some time after the one becomes an infidell that is to say a iew a turke or an obstinate heretike that denies the faith and razeth euen the very foundation of religion in this case what is to be done surely eue such espousals once made and ended if there be no other impediments but these are to stand amp continue firme and vnchangeable so long as the vnbelieuing partie doth willingly yeeld and submit him or her selfe to the performance of mariage duties properly belonging to man and wife my reason is the speech of paul who saith if any brother haue a wife that beleeueth not if she be content to dwell with him let him not forsake her againe the woman which hath an husband that belieueth not if he be content to dwell with her let her not forsake him corinthian if it be heere alledged that the sin of adulterie dissolues the bond both of contract and mariage and therefore much more doth idolatry or infidelity which is a sinne farre more detestable then adulterie i answere that the questio is not whether of these is the greater sin or more hainous in the sight of god for infidelitie in both respects far exceedeth the other but whether of them is more repugnant to the nature and condition of wedlocke now the sinne of adulterie is that alone which breakes the bond and renounceth the troth plighted in mariage and is the proper cause of a diuorce and not idolatry or infidelitie the second note is parity or equalitie in regard of age and condition first of age because though the mariage of persons whose yeares are farre vnequall is not expresly forbidden in the word yet is it agreeable to the rules of expediencie and decencie that the aged should match with the aged the yonger with the yonger reasons are these first because the comforts of this societie in likelihood will by this meanes alwaies be equall and consequently bring the more contentment to either partie secondly these vnequall mariages are often times offensiue to others thirdly they cannot but in some cases proue offensiue euen to themselues for when a man of great yeares matcheth with a woman very yong or a yong stripling marrieth an aged woman the elder partie growing weake and impotent may the sooner come to be vnfit for mariage duties and the yonger being of greater stregth and abilitie the more in danger of being exposed to incontinencie and that in the highest degree vnlesse he be restrained by god speciall grace for this cause it was a great fault wherewith one apuleius was iustly charged that being but a very yong man he was married to a wife of yeares of age secondly of condition and estate for this also is answerable vnto the apostles rule who exhorteth man to thinke of and to do those things which are true iust commendable and of good report philip thus it is a seemely and commendable practise that the prince the noble man the free man the gentleman the yeoman ampc should be ioyned in societie with them that are of the same or like condition with themselues and not otherwise for this cause are the auncient romans greatly to be commended who as we reade in their stories had such a carefull respect of their mariages in this behalfe that they made lawes and constitutions for the restraining of inequalitie of worldly estate in such societies by this meanes preuenting much confusion and disturbance in families and other orders of man whereunto agrees that of tertullian who saith that if a free woman had affianced her selfe to him that was a bond man to another and being thrice admonished thereof by him that had authoritie ouer her did notwithstanding perseuere in her purpose she should according to the law lose her freedome the third note is publike honestie and credit whereby the contract made becomes a matter of good report well thought and spoken of abroad whatsoeuer things are of good report thinke on them philip from hence i gather i that it is an vnseemely thing for a ma to make promise of mariage to such a woman as hath bin formerly deflowred or hath and is or may beconuinced of adulterie amp vncleannes nay i adde further that a cotract made with such a one as himself hath before deflowred is by the law of god unlawful for the adulterer and the adulteresse by diuine law should be put to death and be cut off from humane societie leuit ii it is altogether inexpedient that a woman should be married to such a man as hath a concubine vnlesse hee formerly renounce her and testifie the same by true and vnfeined repentance the reason is plaine such a mariage cannot be vndertaken in the lord and the partie himselfe being before polluted with his concubine becomes now by mariage to another an adulterer and she that is maried vnto him by this her act yeelds consent vnto his adulterie iii that no man professing christian religion much lesse a minister of the word ought to take to himselfe in mariage a harlot a defamed woman or one that comes of infamous parents though she be repentant leuit the priest shall not take to wife one that is a whore or prophaned that is to say which hath an euill name or comes of ignominious parents which law though it was in part ceremonial and leuitical and so far forth abrogate yet hauing in it some moralitie in as much as the reason therof to wit because it is reprochfull to a christian but specially to a minister is still in force it is to be holden perpetuall for christian profession and the ecclesiasticall ministrie is principally to be respected and whatsoeuer may preiudice the dignitie and credit thereof to be auoided obiect the prophet hosea was commanded to take vnto him a wife of fornication that is an harlot hosea answer hosea did it not in deed but in type and resemblance for god commanded him in his prophecie to take vpon him as it were the person of a fornicator that by this meanes hee might the more effectually charge and couince the israelites of their vncleane and vnchast conuersation obiect the lord also forbiddeth the priest to marrie a widow leuit it may seeme therefore vnexpedient for a minister so to do answer the law concerning the mariage of a virgin and not a widow was not enioyned to all priests but only to the chiefe priest leuit and hee also might marrie a widow but such a one only as had bin the widow of a priest and not any other ezech now this was commanded them vpon speciall consideration for the high priest was a type of christ and christ was in time to come to call his church the elect among the gentiles and to marrie them as a virgin espoused vnto himselfe yes he was also to marrie his church as a widow but the widow of a priest only because he was to gather to himselfe the remnant of the church of the iewes howbeit not all of them but such only as came of the holy fathers and were israelites not according to the flesh but according to the promise iv that it is not meete for a man to be contracted to the sister of her that is alreadie affianced vnto him and so much of the first point required to the making of a contract namely the choice of a person fit for mariage the second thing required to the making of a contract is the free and full consent of the parties which is indeed the very soule and life of the contract and this consent standeth in the approbation or as wee commonly call it the sure making of the parties contracted consent in this case is twofold either of the man and the woman or of their parents touching the first that the man and the woman may yeeld free consent each to other it is necessarie that in respect of vnderstanding their iudgemet should be sound and in regard of will their choice should be free and here sundrie cases are to be resolued i case when the contract flowes not from the wil and good liking of the parties but is forced and compelled what is then to be done ans if the espousals haue bin made through force or feare i meane such as may befall a constant and resolute man and which hath bin wrought vpon good knowledge and cosideration then are they of no moment amp in truth meere nullities because there is wanting to them the free and voluntarie accord and assent of both parties neuerthelesse if afterward they shall grow to a new consent or both yeeld to an after acceptation of that which was formerly made the espousals shall then stand in force without further exception or contradiction ii case but how if consent bee past and in processe of time it appeares to the espoused persons that they haue erred either in choice or consent or both answer there is a three fold error in consent the one of the person the other of the abilitie or estate of the person the third of the qualitie error in respect of the person is whe one person is taken for another or whe the contract is made betweene two whereof the one was taken to be such a partie as afterwards he proued not to be now where this error is committed it is a plaine case there was no consent and therefore the contract vpon certaine knowledge therof is quite frustrate for the knowledge of the partie is the ground of consent and belongs consequently to the very substance of mariage neuerthelesse if the error being once knowne the parties haue had secret societie one with another amp haue either againe consented or growen to an after acceptation of the consent before made the contract may and doth stand in full force for example iacob by the deceit of laban had taken leah for rachel to his wife so saith the text when the euening was come laban tooke leah his daughter and brought her to him and he went in vnto her gen but when the morning was come behold it was leah now by the iudgement of the best diuines iacob might iustly haue renounced leah if he would because laban had giuen her vnto him for rachel and so deceiued him yet hee would not vse extremitie but kept her as his wife if it be said there was an error in the person therefore no consent and so leah was not his lawful wife but rachel i answere that iacob did renue his cosent afterward amp that renued cosent following vpon their knowing one of another made her his wife though in extremity amp rigor she was not againe rachel was indeed the partie to whom he was espoused by the former cotract and therfore vpon their mutuall agreement afterward she also became his wife so saith the holy ghost verse fulfill seuen yeares for her and we will also giue thee rachel for thy seruice ampc v then iacob did so and laban gaue him rachel his daughter to be his wife error of the ability or estate is when one of the parties to whom cosent was giuen by the other being taken for rich and wealthie in the issue proues to haue been very poore and not sufficient to maintaine that state of life touching this error it is to be considered whether the cotract was made absolute for the time present amp so for euer afterward or conditional for time to come only if it were absolute that is conceiued in termes of the present time then though the deceit bee verie offensiue to the partie deluded and vpon his complaint ought in equitie to be punished by the magistrate yet it is not of force to breake off the contract because the abilitie of either or both parties belongs not to the essence of mariage but if it were for time to come and conditionate then he or she that made promise vpon this condition is free and not bound in conscience to fulfill the promise vnlesse the condition expressed aforehand be kept and performed error of the qualitie of the person is when she which was in the espousals taken to bee a virgin is afterward found to be with child by another before they come together by this error the couenant is made void and becomes a meere nullitie so as the man cannot be compelled vpon true and certaine knowledge thereof to marrie the woman but may renounce her vnlesse both parties come to a new agreement or haue priuately knowne each other vpon mutuall consent for first god did in expresse tearmes command the iewes that such a woman should be stoned to death deut if the maid that was giuen to wife be not found a virgin verse then shall they bring the maid to the doore of her fathers house and the man of her citie shal stone her with stones to death because she hath wrought folly in israel by playing the whore in her fathers house therefore it was not the will of god that she should be retained as a wife but vtterly reiected and forsaken againe this was so vsual a practise in israel vpon god commandement that godly and righteous man vpon the discouerie of this error would not in conscience be perswaded to marry the to whom they had been betrothed matth ioseph her husband hauing found before marie and he came together that she was with child being a iust man and not willing to make her a publike example was minded to put her away secretly iii case what shall we thinke of the espousals of such as are furious and franticke answer we must distinguish of these diseases for madnes is either perpetuall or by fits only with intermission if it be perpetuall the case is cleere that whether one of the parties only or both be franticke the contract made betweene them is altogether vnprofitable amp vaine for such know not what they do whe they make a promise and the consent which passeth between the cannot be free full and perfect but must needs be hindred and preiudiced by the heate and violence of their disease now although perpetuall madnesse be a iust impediment of mariage and a sufficient cause to dissolue a contract yet it is meet that there be a conuenient space of time agreed vpon wherein all meanes may be vsed for the curing of this disease to the end that god wil touching their amendment may be the more euidently knowne and both the parties themselues and their friends may giue testimonie to the world that they haue had a carefull respect of the contract before made againe if it be not continuall but by dilucida interualla fits so as they haue some good daies and quiet intermissio the case is otherwise for the contract shall be ratified and stand in force prouided that it was manifestly knowne that the said parties were both in their right wits before they plight their troth each to other and themselues be willing afterwards to confirme their promise forme ly made by renuing their consent consent of the parents is that act whereby they giue their word and promise to bestow their children in mariage and in regard of right doe indeed presently bestow them therefore priuate contracts that are made without free and lawful consent of parents are not only vnprofitable and unlawful but euen by the law of god meere nullities reasons i they are contrarie to the expresse will and commandement of god exod honor thy father and thy mother ii they are flat repugnant to naturall equitie which teacheth that he who hath not power nor right ouer himselfe cannot bind himselfe by promise to another now children haue not power ouer themselues but are vnder the gouernment amp at the disposition of their parents therefore the couenants which they make are not made and appointed of god and those which god maketh not are in deed and truth none at all contrary to a complete and lawful cotract is reiection wherby the contract is dissolued or broken off a lawful contract is then dissolued when some great and hainous fault followeth immediately vpo it in either of the parties espoused and from hece arise diverse and sundrie cases to be set downe and resolued the first is this what is to be done when some disease befals one of the parties immediately after the contract made answer those diseases which take away the vse of the bodie and altogether disable the partie from the performance of the promise made in respect of mariage duties are very iust impediments of mariage and consequently do break off the contract of which sort are vncurable palsies frigiditie and such like whereof i haue spoken before neuerthelesse a couenat once made is not suddenly to bee renounced for feare of breeding offence and therefore some longer respite is to be taken from the time of the contract in which they are to rest in expectation of amedment before the said diseases be publikely and solemnely declared to be incurable and consequently that the couenant made is become void now if the disease do not for the present take away the vse of the body and yet in time proues incurablie contagious and so lothsome that the one may iustly feare to keepe and conuerse with the other as it falleth out when one is tainted with leprosie then the contract is vtterly to be dissolued as if god himself should haue commanded it though the promise was formerlie made amp the parties themselues should be vnwilling god hath ordained matrimonie to helpe not to hurt either the persons themselues or others where therefore these diseases be which may infect hurt or destroy others there god hath as it were testified from heauen that the act done is not pleasing vnto him and that presently it ought to be frustrate the contract being thus once dissolued the sounder partie shall be at his or her libertie to marrie againe but the diseased is by the magistrates authoritie to be forbidden societie with any other in way of mariage and commanded to lead his life where he may conueniently from company for feare of infection and withal he is for his owne part to sue vnto god by prayer in faith for the gift of continencie for certaine it is that he to whom god hath denied the power of vsing mariage with good conscience is thereby euen called to continencie and single life but if the disease be not contagious yet either incurable or so nastie that either of the espoused hath iust cause to be afraid of the others company then both are to be aduised not to claime their right but willingly to surrender it each to other by mutuall consent that they may be free againe amp not bound by any former promise to liue together as man and wife considering that they haue no hope mutually to conuerse together with comfort amp contentment while they so remaine vpon this aduice giuen by their lawful pastor or some in his stead if they both yeeld or one of them at the least desires to be at his owne libertie the espousals are forthwith to be broke off but if neither will consent to a separation but rather proceed as they haue begun and in probability the one haue no iust cause to hold the other in suspition in respect of contagion they are not to be hindered from the consummation of their mariage furthermore though one of them should haue a disease which is continuall without intermission amp yet curable or any other incouenience should befall either of them after the sure making wherby they become lame deafe or dumbe ampc yet this is not a sufficient cause to moue them to renounce and dissolue the contract a second case what if it falleth out that after the finishing of the contract one of the espoused persons bee long absent from the other so as the absence bee preiudiciall to the mariage that should ensue vpon the contract answer inquirie must be made whether this absence be voluntarie or against the will of the partie if it be voluntarie for example if the man vpon an honest and iust cause the woman also being priuie thereunto shall go beyond seas and being admonished of his dutie before hand shal notwithstanding stay a whole yeare or more and will not returne but further wilfully absent himselfe then may it be lawful to the woman to craue of the publike magistrate a dissolution of the couenant made amp consequently marry another man vnlesse the former to whom she was contracted be heard of if he be then shall it be lawful for him to pleade for himselfe and tendring no iust cause of his refusall he shall be forced by the magistrates authoritie to stand to his promise and take the woman for his wife and the same order is to be taken in the wilfull absence of the woman after she is contracted if againe the man or woman shall vpon an euill mind and with purpose to deceiue each other absent theselues and depart meanes must be vsed that they may be admonished of their dutie that being done or at least vndertaken and yet the partie offending will not appeare if the other that is present vpon certaine knowledge of his or her want in respect of continencie shall sue to the magistrate after publike and solemne notice giuen the contract may be broken but if on the other side either of them be absent against their wil and intendeth no fraud or deceit but is violently detained by captiuitie imprisonment sicknes force banishment transportation or such like then the partie present being desirous of the consummation of the mariage ought either to make meanes vnto him and expect his returne or haue certaine notice of his death before she promise or haue to do with any other in way of mariage a third case what if after the contract one of the parties becomes furious or madde answer if the disease be continuall without intermission in all equitie and likelihood the espousals are to be dissolued vnlesse both parties after knowledge and experience of the disease haue knowne one another yet in this and all such like cases it is fit that all good meanes be tried and vsed and sufficient time be giuen for the restoring of the diseased to their former good estate and for the accomplishment of the mariage lawfully begun as before mariage is that wherby the coniunction formerly begunne in the contract is solemnely manifested and brought to perfection mariage is consummate by three sorts of actions one of the parents of the bride and bridegroome the other of the minister in publike the third of the persons coupled together the action of the parents is vpon the mariage day to bring the bride and deliuer her to the bride groome that they two may become actually man and wife and performe each to other all matrimoniall duties and where the mariage is complete in any other manner so as the parents vpon sound iudgement and deliberation shall deny their full and free consent either in expresse words or by coniuence and silence and that vpon iust and lawful cause there though in the ciuill courts of man it may stand and the children borne therein bee legitimate before man yet the truth is before god it is of no force but a meere nullitie and because this doctrine touching consent of parents in these cases is of great vse and auaileth much to the supporting and mai ining of families i will first open the truth thereof and then proue it by reasons vnder the name of parents are comprehended first the father and mother secondly all tutors and guardians who haue the proper amp sole charge of wards or others vnder yeares of discretion thirdly all such as are kindred of blood who are in stead of parents to childre as the vncle by the fathers side the vncle by the mothers side and such like now touching the consent of parents that is of father and mother i hold it requisite of necessitie to marriage for the authoritie of parents must not be resisted or violated as for tutors and such as haue the place of parents their consent is not required of necessitie but de honestate of honestie at least because the power and authoritie of the parent though it be not taken away yet it is lessened when it is either transferred to another person or in part resteth in the child alreadie bestowed secondly by parents consent i vnderstand that which they giue not rashly vnaduisedlie or foolishlie but out of good amp wise consideration and vpon true and sound iudgement of the businesse in hand for otherwise as much as in them lieth they make the mariage void and of none effect and they are then thought to carrie a right iudgement of the thing when they be able to yeeld a iust cause of yeelding or denying their consent for example if a father denies to bestow his daughter iulia vpon sempronius because hee knowes him to be an arrian a pelagian or of any other sort of heretikes he withholdeth his consent vpon a good ground amp he doth that which he doth of iudgement yet further i adde that where the parents do dissent and can yeeld no probable cause thereof the mariage consummate without their consent ought to be confirmed and ratified by the authoritie of the magistrate who is pater patriae and this seemes to be the most equall course both for the auoiding of greater scandals amp for the preuenting of wrong that may otherwise be done in some particular case as to a woman that is defloured and reiected thirdly consent of parents is either expressed or implied expressed when it is giuen by words implied when it is yeelded by silence for it standeth with most equitie and indifferencie to thinke that those parents do giue consent who do not by word expresly denie the same fourthly children are either subiect to the authoritie of their parents in the familie or at their owne libertie amp out of their parents subiection those that are at liberty are tied necessarily to subiection in respect of mariage but the other being still of the familie and vnder iurisdiction are bound to be ordered by their parents in the bestowing of themselues this is briefly the meaning of the question in hand now for proofe of this point i will propound three sorts of arguments wherof some are drawne from the law of god some from the light of nature and some from the iudgement of the ancient church for the first sort according to the law of god mariage is not only a ciuill and politike but also a diuine and spirituall coniunction the author and ordainer whereof vpon speciall cause was god himselfe this our sauiour christ witnesseth when he saith those whom god hath ioyned together let no man separate matth that therefore mariages may be soundly ratified and confirmed the authoritie and power of god himselfe is necessarily to be interposed if it be asked how god that is in heauen should bring and ioyne together man and wife vpon the earth i answere that he doth it not immediately by himselfe as he brought euah vnto adam but in amp by some solemne and lawful meanes and this meane is that great and ancient power and prerogatiue of parets and the law of god hath giuen them this power not in ciuill contracts and compositions alone but euen in the beginning and accomplishing of mariages deut thou shalt not giue thy daughter vnto his son nor take his daughter vnto thy son ierem take wiues for your sonnes and giue your daughters vnto husbands that they may beare sonnes and daughters corinthian but if any man thinke that it is vncomlie for his virgin if shee passe the flower of her age and need so require let him doe what he will he sinneth not let them be maried hence it was that abraham by right of this authoritie gaue order what wife his servant should prouide for his son thou shalt not take a wife to my son of the daughters of the canaanites but thou shalt go vnto my country and to my kindred and take a wife vnto my son isaac gen sampson though he was inflamed with the loue of the woma in timnath whom he saw to be beautifull in his eyes yet hee durst not take her to his wife till she was giuen him of his parents iudg it was an expresse law of god that if a man intised a maid that was not betrothed and lay with her hee should endow her and take her to his wife but how marke in what manner the holy ghost proceedeth if her father refuse to giue her to him he shall pay money according to the dowrie of virgin exod deut in which text moses plainly teacheth that the consent of the two parties is not sufficient no not though they haue had societie together vnlesse they haue the free cosent of their parents also in like maner it was ordained by god numb that if a woman vowed a vow vnto the lord being in her fathers house amp her father hearing it holdeth his peace concerning her that is approueth her vow by winking at it her vow shall stand but if her father disallow her that is giueth no approbation or consent vnto the vow made it shall be of no value and the lord wil forgiue her because her father consented not now if the vow of children made vnto god and pertaining to his worship cannot be ratified without the parents approbation of how much lesse force shall any priuate contract or mariage be without their allowance the second argument is taken from the light of nature and it is gathered by proportion on this manner a son priuilie alienateth and selleth away his fathers lands either in whole or in part the question is whether this alienation be good in law yes or no answere is no and why because the land did not belong to the son but was part of his fathers substance in like manner a son alienates himselfe and is betrothed to a woman to marrie her without his parents knowledge is this act of the son warrantable and sound by no meanes for the son in respect of his body is part of the fathers goods and may not be alienated from him without consent a notable reason hereof we find in iob for when god had giuen satan power to destroy and spoile all iobs goods and whatsoeuer he had the diuell doth not only touch the wealth of iob but his children also as a part of his substance in this respect the iewes were permitted by god to sell their children exodus againe for the accomplishment of mariage there must needs be a mutuall donation betweene the spouse and the espoused and what is that which is mutually giuen surely their persons or rather their body each to other for so paul saith corinthian let euery man haue his wife and let euery woman haue her owne husband but by whom is this donation to be made by son and daughters that are in the familie vnder the iurisdiction of their parents it may not be for nature her selfe taketh it for granted that he which is not at his own libertie cannot yeeld to the giuing of himselfe the donation therefore remaines in the right of the parent in as much as the wil amp consent of the child ought to depend vpon his wil and consent to whom god hath giuen power and authoritie in this behalfe in the third place let the iudgement of the ancient church be obserued ambrose in his first booke of the patriarch abraham chap requires this consent in mariages which he saith is so equall and agreeable to nature that eue the poets acknowledged the same for which purpose he reciteth two verses out of the greek poet euripides in his tragedie called andromacha wherin in when orestes desired to marrie hermion she frames him this answere that the matter of her mariage wholly depended vpon the pleasure and authoritie of her father amp was not in her owne power or libertie innocentius who was both a pope and martyr in his decretall epistles so strictly requireth consent of parents as where it is wanting he concludes the mariage to be void in the coucell of lateran it was decreed that clandestine contracts amp secret mariages made and vndertaken betweene partie and partie should be holden as unlawful as mariages in those degrees of consanguinitie and affinitie which are forbidden by god tertullian saith that in this world the son cannot rit amp iure basil epistle ad amphiloch canon rightly and lawfully marrie without the allowance of his father basil in an epistle to amphilochius bishop of iconium affirmeth that mariages which are made without them which haue power ouer the parties are fornications and therefore that they which are ioyned together in mariage while their parents or masters liue are in no sort free from imputation of sin vntill they haue approbation from them for then mariage is ratified amp confirmed when they haue yeelded allowance thereunto the second action touching the consummation of mariage is the action of the minister and that is the blessing or sanctification thereof which is a solemne worke wherby the minister pronouncing the parties contracted to be man and wife before the whole congregation commendeth them and their estate vnto god by solemne prayer this solemne sanctification is grounded vpon the practise of god himselfe who hauing giuen euah to adam blessed them saying increase and multiplie gen and for that which god then gaue the minister standing in his roome now prayeth may be giuen to the man and wife yes it is agreeable to the generall rule of the apostle let all things bee done decently and in order corinthian now that this action is to be approued and vsed in the church appeares by these reasons i mariage as it is a publike action so it is after a sort a spirituall and diuine ordinance whereby it differeth from the contract for the contract being meerely ciuill as it standeth by consent of man so by the same consent it may bee broken and dissolued but with mariage it is otherwise ii marriage is the seminarie of the church and common wealth iii it was the practise of y e primitiue church tertullian speaking of the marriage of christians with christians acknowledgeth himselfe not to bee able sufficiently to declare the happines of that coniunction which is made by the church consecrated by prayers amp oblationem sic exponit beatus rhenanus niceph lib cap ambros epistolar lib epistle ad vigilium solemne seruice witnessed by the angels and ratified by god himselfe nicephorus reporteth of one synesius who auouched that god amp the lawes and the holy hand of thesphylus had giuen him a wife ambrose saith that mariage ought to be sactified with the vaile wherewith the priest was wont to couer the bride and the bride groome in the publike congregation and with his blessing the third and last action belonging to the accomplishment of this estate is that of the parties themselues whereby the bride is in decent and modest manner brought vnto the house and home of the bride groome it is the law of this estate published by god himselfe in paradise that the man euen in respect of habitation should leaue father and mother and cleaue to his wife gen heere question is moued whether mariage is to be solemnized with mirth and feasting answer i it is lawful and warrantable to vse feasting and mirth at mariages because these be things indifferent and wee haue examples thereof in the scriptures laban made a feast at the wedding of iacob and rachel and inuited all the man of the place to it gen christ himselfe did approue the resort of people to the mariage at cana in galilee both by his presence and by that honorable gift of sixe water pots of the best wine ioh ii it is not only lawful but conuenient and fit to be done if there be abilitie according to the commendable custome of the place amp country wherin man do dwell so as in the vse thereof these cautions bee obserued first that in mirth and merry making there be care had that nothing be done which is dishonest prophane or of ill report philip whatsoeuer things are honestpure of good report thinke on these things secondly that ioy in them be mixed and moderated with the feare of god without which laughter and reioycing is meere madnesse ecclesiastes thirdly that it bee performed in a moderate and sober vse of the creatures without riot amp excesse thus we reade that at the great feast of ahashuerosh it was appointed by the king himself that they should drink orderly amp none might compel another to drinke more then he thought conuenient ester and where weddings are kept contrary to these directions they are not feasts celebrated vnto god but vnto y e diuell which also may be said of all other festiuall meetings and so much touching the point of mariage in which this is to be remembred for a coclusion that where there is generally a nullitie in the contract or a separation following vpon it there is also a nullity in regard of the consummation of mariage thus farre haue we proceeded in the doctrine of marriage and now we come to the duties which they who bee maried are to performe each to other these are principally two cohabitation and communion cohabitation is their quiet and comfortable dwelling together in one place for the better performance of mutuall duties corinthian and to the married command i not i but the lord let not the wife separate her selfe from her husband verse but to the remnant i say not the lord if any brother haue an vnbeleeuing wife and she be content to dwell with him let him not forsake her verse and the wife which hath an vnbeleeuing husband which is content to dwell with her let her not forsake him pet likewise let the man dwell together as becometh them that haue knowledge giuing honor to the woman as to the weaker vessell euen as they which are heires together of the grace of life that your prayers be not interrupted this dutie must bee kept especiallie the first yeare of mariage deut when a man taketh a wife hee shall not go on warfare neither shall be charged with any busines but shall bee free at home one yeare amp reioyce with his wife which he hath taken and the ground of this commandement no doubt is that they might learne to know one anothers coditions and that they might worke a setled affection one towards another which afterward vpon no occasion might bee changed yet they may bee absent each from other in two cases first vpon mutuall consent for a time for the performing of some busines that is requisite for the familie prou for mine husband is not at home he is gone a far iourney at the appointed time he will returne againe secondly the like absence is allowed when some great and weightie affaires either in the church or common wealth are in hand sam but vriah slept at the doore of the kings palace with all the servant of his lord and went not downe to his house v ii then vriah answered dauid the arke and israel and iudah dwell in tents and my lord ioab and all the servant of my lord abide in the open field shall i then go into my house to eate and drinke and lie with my wife by thy life and by the life of my soule i will not do this thing hence ariseth a question what if after mariage consummate there grow vpon one of the parties a contagious disease that cannot be cured but is so lothsome that the other whole partie cannot endure cohabitation at all answer both the mariage it selfe and the dutie of dwelling together ought to continue firme and sure notwithstanding yet so as the sound partie neither may nor ought in good conscience to desire coniunction with the other whereby he or she may bring infection vpon themselues and consequently hurt their children and indanger the common wealth but if either of the parties haue not the gift of continencie nor cannot abstaine they must sue for it vnto god in earnest prayer who will giue it vnto them for there god hath called a man or woman to continencie where they be necessarily hindred from the vse of the ordinarie and lawful remedie of the contract the contrarie to cohabitation is desertion desertion is when one of the married folkes vpon a wilfull and obstinate mind of their owne head departeth from the other without a iust and necessarie cause touching this point there bee sundrie cases expounded i case suppose that an husband which is an vnbeleeuer or an heretike in the foundation of his owne accord vpon detestation of true religion quite forsakes the beleeuing wife and denies any more to dwell with her what is to be done answer all good meanes must bee first vsed to bring the infected partie to repentance and when none will succeed but the case remaineth desperate then mariage is dissolued on his part and the beleeuing wife is free to marrie another so saith the apostle corinthian if the vnbeleeuing partie depart let him depart a brother or a sister is not in subiection in such things but god hath called vs vnto peace in which words obserue a twofold reason i he that is at libertie may marrie another now the beleeuing partie forsaken is at libertie because hee is not in subiection in such things therefore he may marrie another ii god hath called vs vnto peace saith paul and this peace cannot be kept if the beleeuing partie forsaken cannot containe vnlesse he marrie ambrose vpon the place saith that mariage cannot stand firme which is separated from the worship and seruice of god and therefore it is no sinne in the partie that is for saken for god cause to be married to another and the vnbeleeuer departing sinneth both against god and against the law of wedlock because he denies to remain in that estate in regard of religion therefore hee breakes the couenant of mariage and the other is not bound in this case to keepe touch with him the master of the sentences saith that the beleeuing partie in this case is not bound to follow the vnbeleeuer when hee departeth but while hee liues may marrie another augustine affirmeth that euen the wife which is ioyned to her husband in lawful societie if shee will not abide with her christian husband because he is a christian may be forsaken and left without sin and it is far better that the couenant should be dissolued that man and wife haue made each with other then that the couenant which man hath made with god the people of israel being in affliction were constrained to break the former made with strange woman that they might keepe the latter ezra it is alledged that the vnbeleeuing partie may haply repent and then to make a dissolution is in vaine but i say that it is as likely that he will neuer repent and therefore there is cause that the knot should be dissolued againe it is lawful say some to make a diuorce out of the case of adulterie answer the belieuing partie which is forsaken is not the cause of the diuorce but is a patient of the separation wrongfully made by the vnbeleeuer and christ where he mentioneth the case of adulterie matth speaketh of an equall mariage whereas paul speakes of an vnequall ii case what if there fall out a desertion betweene two married folkes which are both beleeuers answer the faultie person who is the cause of this desertion is to be forced by course of ciuill and ecclesiasticall censure to performe his or her dutie vpon which proceeding if he remaine obstinate and peruerse in will the other must in patience amp earnest prayer vnto god waite the time vntill his mind may be changed and he made to relent by the order of the magistrate but if the one of them by iust occasion of feare be compelled to depart from the other and cannot returne againe without apparent danger of life in this case they are not bound to returne but the delinquent partie is to remaine solitarie till they be instructed and made willing to doe their duties and in the meane while the partie innocent must be resolued that god hath called him or her to single life againe be it that the one is resolutely vnwilling to dwell with the other and thereupon flies away without any fault of the other if the thing after a long space bee sufficiently knowne before hand and all possible meanes haue been vsed to reclaime the guiltie person yes being called he doth not personally appeare before the iudge to yeeld a reason of the fact after publike and solemne declaration made the minister vpon such desertion may pronounce the mariage to be dissolued for he that vpon malice flieth away from his mate is to bee holden in the same termes with an vnbelieuer who departs vpon detestation of religion and the seruice of god tim howbeit if the place whither he is fled be vnknowne and vpon his flight there be found some fault in the plaintiffe she is not to be heard or set at libertie by the iudge in this case though shee pretend want of the gift of continencie but suppose he that fled come againe vnlooked for and requires his spouse then in case the former course hath not bin taken nor iudgement giuen against him they may be reconciled and come together againe if it hath and matters be concluded hee is not vpon his returne to bee heard but rather seuerely punished like vnto desertion is malicious and spitefull dealing of married folkes one with the other malicious dealing is when dwelling together they require each of other intolerable conditions and when the one doth not regard nor relieue the other being in danger or extremity as is meet for this is as much as to betray one anothers estate and life to their vtter enemy heere it may be demanded what a belieuer should do who is in certaine and imminent danger either of losse of life or breach of conscience if they both abide together answer i this certaine danger hath his originall either from one that is a stranger or from one of the parties if from a stranger then the husband either takes vpon him the defence of his belieuing wife or not if he doth then she ought to abide with him if not she may depart and prouide for her owne safetie ii againe if the husband threatneth hurt the belieuing wife may flie in this case and it is all one as if the vnbelieuing man should depart for to depart from one and driue one away by threats are aequipollent neither may this seeme strange vnto any that the belieuer in such case is allowed to depart for a husband that is a christian is married two waies first with christ and secondly with his wife the former mariage is made in baptisme and is a more holy coniunction then is the latter therfore when these two cannot stand together but one of them must needs be dissolued the latter must rather be left then the former againe if the belieuer should remaine with the vnbelieuer she should haplie be vrged sometimes in case of danger vpon infirmitie to deny christ amp make ship wracke of faith and good conscience which may in no sort be done of either partie and therefore separation is to be made rather in this society then that the coiunction with christ should not stand firme and continue it is alledged that if this be so then the belieuing wife forsakes the vnbelieuing husband which she may not do answer she forsakes him not finally but leaues him for a time againe the desertion is not made by the person which giueth place for the time but by him in whom is the cause of the desertion euen as he is not to be termed a schismatike which separateth himself but hee in whom is the cause of the schisme againe it is obiected that he which flieth leaues his calling and euery man must abide in his calling according to the rule of the apostle corinthian answer there is a double calling the generall standing in the worship of god the particular as the calling of mariage or of single life when these two callings cannot stand together the latter must giue place to the former luke if any man come to me amp hate not his father and mother and wife and children and brother and sisters yes and his owne life also he cannot be my disciple iii case when the husband is perpetually absent from the wife what is to be done answer if he be absent either because he is in captiuitie or vpon malice or feare or any such like cause the wife must rest in expectation of his returne till she hath notice of his death either by sufficient testimonie or by apparant likelihoods now in the want of testimonies and coniectures in this behalfe if the partie forsaken cannot certainly determine that the absence was made vpon an euill mind some haue thought that it behoueth her to expect his comming again for the space of foure years others of fiue some of seuen some of ten yeares after which time she is free and may marrie another man and if the partie do haplie returne againe after some long space of time who was probablie thought to haue been dead the latter ma iage vndertaken vpon necessarie ignorance of such an euent may be dissolued and it shall not be imputed to either partie considering it fell out not by their fault but only by accident now if the question bee of wilfull and affected absence the same is to be determined concerning that which hath bin said before touching the point of desertion the comunion of man amp wife is that dutie whereby they do mutually and willingly communicate both their persons amp goods each to other for their mutuall helpe necessitie and comfort ephesian so ought me to loue their wiues as their own body he that loueth his wife loueth himselfe this dutie consisteth principally in the performance of special beneuolece one to another amp that not of courtesie but of due debt corinthian let the husband giue vnto the wife due beneuolence and likewise also the wife vnto the husband due beneuolence must be shewed with a singular and entire affection one towards another and that three waies principally first by the right and lawful vse of their body or of the marriage bed which is indeed an essentiall dutie of mariage the mariage bed signifieth that solitarie and secret societie that is betweene man and wife alone and it is a thing of it owne nature indifferent neither good nor bad and so paul numbereth it amongst indifferent things corinthian article thou bound vnto a wife seeke not to be loosed article thou loosed from a wife seeke not a wife wherfore the church of rome erreth two contrarie waies first in that it maketh mariage to be a sacrament and so euerie action of it to be of the owne nature good secondly in that they prohibite mariage of certaine parties and the reason of the prohibition may seeme to be this that they thinke this secret comming together of man and wife to be filthines this was the sentence of syricius that filthie pope of rome who determined that mariage was the vncleannesse of the flesh and to that purpose abused the words of the apostle rom affirming that they which are in the flesh that is in the estate of matrimonie cannot please god yes and after that mariage was condemned by them some began to detest and hate woman as ephraim the syrian of who ecclesiasticall stories make mention and the councell of trent is of the same iudgement for whereas it opposeth mariage and chastitie it plainly determineth that in mariage there is no chastitie this comming together of man and wife although it be indifferent yet by the holy vsage thereof it is made a holy and vndefiled action hebr mariage is honorable among all and the bedde vndefiled and it is as all other creatures and ordinances of god are sanctified by the word amp praier tim forbidding to marry ampc v and nothing ought to be refusedfor it is sanctified by the word of god amp praier in which place it is to be obserued how the apostle applieth the point of sanctification directly to mariage the word of god giueth direction to married folkes two wayes first by giuing them warrant that they may lawfully do this action because whatsoeuer is not done of faith which faith must be grounded on god word is a sin secondly by prescribing the right and holy manner of doing the same the holy maner stands in these particulars first that it be done in moderation for euen in wedlocke excesse in lusts is no better then plaine adulterie before god this is the iudgement of the ancient church that intemperance that is immoderate desire euen betweene man and wife is fornication secondly that it be vsed in an holy abstinence abstinence from this secret societie must be vsed in two cases first while the woman is in her flowers leuit thou shalt not go to a woman to vncouer her shame as long as shee is put apart for her disease and it is made one of the properties of a good man not to lie with a menstruous woman ezek secondly in the time of a solemne fast when some grieuous calamitie is imminent then they are to giue themselues by mutuall consent to fasting and prayer corinthian defraud not one another except it be with consent for a time that you may giue your selues to fasting and prayer and againe come together that satan tempt you not for your incontinencie sam then vriah answered dauid the arke and israel and iudah dwell intents and my lord ioab and the servant of my lord abide in the open fields shall i then go into mine house to eate and drinke and lie with my wife by thy life and by the life of thy soule i will not do this thing zach the familie of the house of dauid shall mourne apart and their wiues apart the familie of the house of nathan apart and their wiues apart ampc next vnto the word this action may be sanctified by prayer for a blessing vpon it children are the gift of god and therfore married folkes are not only to vse the meanes but also to pray for the obtaining of them psalm he maketh the barren woman to dwell with a familie and to be a ioyfull mother of children psalm behold children are the inheritance of the lord and the fruit of the wombe his reward examples for this purpose are these gen isaac prayed vnto the lord for his wife because shee was barren and the lord was intreated of him and rebekah his wife conceiued sam and she said oh my lord as thy soule liueth my lord i am the woman that stood with thee here praying vnto the lord verse i prayed for this child and the lord hath giuen me my desire which i asked of him now the fruits which are reaped and inioyed by this holy vsage of the mariage bed are three i the hauing of a blessed seed deut if thou shalt obey diligently the voice of the lord thy god ampc blessed shall be the fruit of thy bodie and the fruit of thy ground which also is called the seed of god being begot in an holy maner mal and did not he make one yet had he abundance of spirit and wherefore one because he sought a seed of god therefore keepe your selues in your spirit and let none trespasse against the wife of his youth ii the preseruation of the bodie in cleannesse that it may be a fit temple for the holy ghost to dwell in thess this is the will of god euen your sanctification that euery one of you should know how to possesse his vessell in holines and honor and not in the lust of concupiscence euen as the gentiles that know not god iii the holy estate of marriage is a liuely type of christ and his church and this communion of married persons is also a figure of the coniunction that is betweene him and the faithfull hos i will marrie thee vnto me for euer yes i will marrie the vnto me in righteousnes in iudgement in mercie and in copassion i will euen marrie thee vnto me in faithfulnes and thou shalt know the lord ephesian for the husband is the wiues head euen as christ is the head of the church and the same is the sauiour of his bodie heere some questions are to be resolued case i whether may mariage be dissolued in the case of barrennesse answer no for barrennesse is an hidden infirmitie for the most part and which god hath many times cured euen when it seemed to be desperate as in sarah again the fruit of the wombe is god blessing and wholly dependeth vpon him hee therefore that in want of children reiecteth his wife whom he hath receiued at the hands of god offereth wrong euen to god himselfe case ii what if either of the married folkes commit fornication or any sinne of the same kind greater then fornication as incest sodomie lying with beast or such like answer adulterie and fornication are most grieuous and open crimes which do breake the very bond and couenant of mariage prou and therfore when they are certainly knowne by such persons they are at no hand to be winked at but the magistrate is presently to be informed of them howbeit if the innocent partie be willing to receiue the adulterer againe in regard of his repentance lest hee should seeme to fauour and maintaine sin and to bee himselfe a practiser of vncleannesse he is to repaire to the congregation and declare the whole matter to the minister that he may vnderstand the parties repentance and desire of forgiuenesse and if the adulteresse hath conceiued and is in trauell the husband to auoid the imputation of hauing an heire in bastardie is to make relation to the church of the repentance of the adulteresse or to acquaint some certaine persons therewith not to the end that she should be punished for the fact but that they may take notice of a child coceiued in adultery whom afterward he may lawfully put off as none of his the matter being knowne the innocent partie may require a diuorcement for adulterie is such a sin as doth quite break off not only the vse but the bond and couenant of mariage matth i say therefore vnto you that whosoeuer shall put away his wife except it be for whoredome and marrie another committeth adulterie ampc and yet the same bond may be continued and grow vp againe by the good will and consent of the partie innocent and consequently they may be reconciled and dwell together still sam now saul had giuen michal his daughter dauids wife to phalti the son of laish which was of gallim sam then dauid sent messengers to ishbosheth sauls son saying deliuer me my wife michal which i married for an hundred foreskins of the philistims the same course may be taken in like cases by the innocent specially vpon the repentance of the guiltie person but yet euery man must be left to his owne conscience and none is to bee compelled to take another from whom hee may iustly bee separated against his will now in requiring of a diuorce there is an equall right and power in both parties so as the woman may require it as well as the man and he as wel as she the reason is because they are equally bound each to other and haue also the same interest in one anothers bodie prouided alwaies that the man is to maintaine his superioritie and the woman to obserue that modestie which beseemeth her towards the man after the diuorcement made it shal be lawful for the harmelesse partie not hauing the gift of continencie vpon leaue obtained of the church and the christian magistrate to marrie againe but what then shall become of the partie offending answer if vpon the hazard of his conscience in want of the remedie any libertie of second mariage bee to bee granted vnto him by the church or ciuill magistrate as indeed here in england there is not diverse restraints in this case must be obserued first no such libertie is to be granted so long as the matter remaines vncertaine whether they may be reconciled specially while the partie innocent liueth in single life secondly it must euidently appeare that the said offending partie hath earnestly rpented him of his sin before he can either be receiued into the church or admitted to a second mariage thirdly this liberty is not to be granted him either presently or vnaduisedly but vpon frequent and serious admonition rather to giue himselfe to mourning and lamentation and still to remaine alone then to desire againe to enioy the benefit of that state which he hath alreadie so shamefully abused so much of the first way of performance of due beneuolence the second way is by cherishing one another ephesian no man euer hated his owne flesh but nourisheth and cherisheth it as christ also doth the church this cherishing is the performing of any duties that tend to the preseruing of the liues one of another wherefore they are freely to comunicate their goods their cousel their labors each to other for the good of themselues and theirs the third way is by an holy kind of reioicing and solacing themselues each with other in a mutuall declaration of the signes and tokens of loue and kindnesse prou reioyce with the wife of thy youth verse let her be as the louing hind and pleasant wild goat let her breasts satisfie thee at all times and delight in her loue continually cantic let him kisse me with the kisses of his mouth for thy loue is better them wine gen so after he had bin there a long time abimelek king of the philistims looked out at a window and loe hee saw isaac sporting with rebekah his wife then abimelek called isaac and said loe shee is of a suretie thy wife esay as a yong man marrieth a virgin so shall thy sonnes marrie thee and as a bridegroome is glad of the bride so shall thy god reioyce ouer thee this reioycing and delight is more permitted to the man then to the woman and to them both more in their yong yeares then in their old age married folkes are either husbad or wife the husband is he which hath authoritie ouer the wife hereupon in scripture he is called the guide of her youth prou and they twaine being but one flesh he is also the head ouer his wife the duties of the husband towards the wife are these i to loue her as himselfe ephesians let euery one loue his wife euen as himselfe gen afterward isaac brought her vnto the tent of sarah his mother and hee tooke rebekah and she was his wife and he loued her so isaac left mourning for his mother note how the loue of the husband to the wife mitigates sorrow for the death of the mother he is to shew this loue in two things first in protecting her from danger gen and vnto sarah he said behold i haue giuen shekels of siluer vnto thy brother behold he is the couering of thine eies amongst all that are with thee let it be knowne amongst all amp be thou instructed sam dauids two wiues were taken prisoners also ahinoam the izreelite and abigail the wife of nabal the carmelite v then dauid asked counsell of the lord saying shall i follow after this company shall i ouertake them and hee answered him follow for thou shalt surely ouertake them and recouer all secondly in regarding her estate as his owne and prouiding maintenance for her both for his life time and as much as he may for time to come after his death ephesian so ought man to loue their wiues as their owne body he that loueth his wife loueth himselfe verse for no man yet hated his owne flesh but nourisheth it ampc exod if he take him another wife he shall not diminish her food her rayment and recompence of her virginitie ruth vnto whom he said who article thou which said i am ruth thine handmaid spread therefore the wing of thy garment ouer thine handmaid for thou article the kinsman ii to honor his wife pet giuing honor to the woman this honor stands in three things first in making account of her as his companion or yoke fellow for this cause the woman when she was created was not take out of the mans head because she was not made to rule ouer him nor out of his feet because god did not make her subiect to him as a servant but out of his side to the end that man should take her as his mate secodly in a wise amp patiet bearing or couering of her infirmities as anger waywardnes and such like in respect of the weaknes of her sexe pet giuing honor to the woman as vnto the weaker vessell seeing yee are heires together of the grace of life that your prayers bee not hindred thirdly by suffering himselfe sometimes to be admonished or aduised by her it was god commandement to abraham concerning sarah his wife let it not be grieuous in thy sight for the child and for thy bond woman in all that sarah shall say vnto thee heare her voice for in isaac shall thy seed be called gen thus elkanah was willing to subscribe vnto his wife annaes aduice for her tarrying at home till the child was weaned sam and elkanah her husband said vnto her do what seemeth thee best tarrie vntill thou hast weaned him only the lord accomplish his word hereupon the heathen philosopher said that the master of the familie exerciseth after a sort a power tyrannical ouer his servant a power regall ouer his children because kings are fathers of their comon weales but in respect of his wife he exerciseth a power aristocraticall not after his owne will but agreeable to the honor and dignitie of the married estate and consequently that he ought not in modestie to challenge the priuiledge of prescribing and aduertising his wife in al matters domesticall but in some to leaue her to her owne will and iudgement heere question is moued whether the husband may correct the wife answer though the husband be the wiues head yet it seemeth he hath no power nor libertie granted him in this regard for we reade not in the scriptures any precept or example to warrant such practise of his authoritie he may reproue amp admonish her in word only if he seeth her in fault for thus we reade that iacob censured his wife being impatient euen in anger gen am i in god stead which hath withholden from thee the fruit of the wombe and iob reproued his wife iob thou speakest like a foolish woman what shall we receiue good at the hand of god and not receiue euill but hee may not chastise her either with stripes or stroks the reason is plaine wiues are their husbands mates and they two be one flesh and no man will hate much lesse beat his owne flesh but nourisheth and cherisheth it ephesian againe it is the commandement of god that man should not trespasse against the wife of his youth malac chrysostom saith it is the greatest reproch for any man that can bee to beate his wife plutarch in the life of cato the censor affirmeth that he which smiteth his wife doth all one as if he should lay violent hands vpon the sacred images of the god which was counted an high degree of offence among the heathen it is alledged husbands are comanded so to loue their wiues as christ doth his church now christ chastiseth his church with strokes amp therefore so may the husband his wife answer as christ doth entirely loue his church so hee may also chastise the same because hee is not only the husband but also absolute lord and king of his church so is not the husband absolute ouer the wife but his authority ouer the wife is after a sort ciuill as is the authoritie of the magistrate ouer his people ans it is not so for the magistrate hath in his hand the power of the sword by which power he inflicteth punishment in case of offence but the husband can challenge to himselfe no such power yes it is flatly forbidden in the ciuil law that he should scourge or strike his wife neuerthelesse if she grow to extremities and be desperately peruerse so as there be no hope of amendment then the magistrate may be informed who to preuent scandals and to prouide for publike peace both ought and may assigne vnto her necessary correction and punishment according to her desert now the husband that hath a wife so stubborne and peeuish must beare it if it may be borne as the portion of his crosse laid vpon him by god and in this case if he be impatient he may in some sort be pardoned and pitied but he is not wholly to be excused the wife is the other married person who being subiect to her husband yeeldeth obedience vnto him touching the subiection of the wife the word of god metioneth it in sundrie places rom the woman which is in subiection to the man is bound by the law to the man while he liueth ephesian as the church is in subiection to christ euen so let the wiues bee to their husbands in euery thing colos wiues submit your selues vnto your husbands as it is comely in the lord tim i permit not a womanto vsurpe authoritie ouer the man and it was a law established by god immediately after the fal gen vnto the woman he said i wil greatly increase ampc and thy desire shal be subiect to thine husband and he shall rule ouer thee indeed the daughter according to the ciuill law euen when shee is married is in potestate patris in the power of her father and not of her husband but this is directly against the law of moses and crosseth the law of nature leuit numb now the duties of the wife are principally two the first is to submit her selfe to her husband and to acknowledge and reuerence him as her head in all things gen likewise abimelech said vnto sarah behold thy brother that is thy husband whom thou callest thy brother is the vaile of thine eyes to all that are with thee as if he should say thy husband is thy head and hath power ouer thee and thou oughtest to reuerence him for of ancient times the wife was couered with a vaile in the presence of her husband in token of subiection to him thus rebekah at the sight of isaac tooke a vaile and couered her head therewith gen corinthian the man is the womans head ephesian wiues submit your selues vnto your husbands as vnto the lord for the husband is the wiues head euen as christ is the head of his church the reason hereof is good for the wife enioyeth the priuiledges of her husband and is graced by his honor and estimation amongst man his nobilitie maketh her noble though otherwise shee is base and meane as contrariwise his basenesse and low degree causeth her though shee bee by birth noble and honorable to bee by estate base and meane the second dutie is to be obedient vnto her husband in all things that is wholly to depend vpon him both in iudgement and will for looke as the church yeelds obedience to christ her head and yeelds her selfe to be commanded gouerned and directed by him so ought the woman to the man so sarah is said to obey abraham and to giue him the termes of obedience shee called him lord or sir pet hence it followeth that the woman is not to take libertie of wandring and straying abroad from her owne house without the mans knowledge amp cosent king then she called to her husband and said send with me i pray thee one of the yong man and one of the asses for i will haste to the man of god and come againe againe that shee is to follow her husband when hee flitteth or departeth from place to place vnlesse hee forsake either her or christ to this purpose paul saith hee had power to lead about a wife being a sister as well as the rest of the apostles corinthian thus sarah went with abraham into egypt gen and out of egypt gen and to gerar to soiourne there gen thus the wiues of iacob departed with him from their father laban gen contrary to these duties are the sins of wiues to be proud to be vnwilling to beare the authority of their husbads to chide and braule with bitternes to forsake their houses ampc prou a continuall dropping in the day of raine and a contentious woman are alike verse he that hideth her hideth the winde amp she is as the oyle in his right hand that vttereth it selfe exod then zipporah said o bloodie husband because of the circumcision it was the fault of the leuites concubine iudg who played the whore and went away from him vnto her fathers house to bethlem iudah and there continued the space of foure moneths it was the sinne of queene vashi who refused to come at the kings word which he had giuen in charge to the eunuches therefore the king was verie angrie and his warth kindled in him ester lastly to be a cause of griefe to their kindred thus the proud wiues of esau the daughters of the hittites were a griefe of mind to isaac and rebekah gen amp hitherto hath been treated of the first couple whereof the family cosisteth namely of married folkes now follow the other and they are of two sorts either such as whereby the familie is increased and multiplied or such as are helpes thereunto those whereby the familie is inlarged are also of two sorts parents and children parents are they which haue power and authoritie ouer children the duties of parents are especially two one to bring vp their children the other to bestow them when they haue brought them vp touching education or bringing vp of children the parents care must bee both that they may liue and also that they may liue well ephesian touching the preseruation of the life of the child there are many duties required of the parents specially foure first the mother is her selfe to giue the infant sucke and to wrap it vp in swadling cloth paul comends it for a note of a good wife to nurse her owne children tim thus sarah gaue sucke to isaac gen anna nursed samuel sam dauid in likelihood was nursed by his mother psalm thou gauest me hope euen at my mothers breasts and our sauiour christ was also nursed by marie his mother luke and swadled luke now the reason hereof is plaine god hath giuen milke to woman that beare children amp hath so appointed that no meat is more naturall to the child then the mothers milke and nature it selfe teacheth this in the course of other creatures the earth nourisheth that which it bringeth forth the fruit which the tree beareth is fed by the sap that comes from the root therof yes amongst the bruit beast euen those that be most savage as the tigres do giue sucke vnto the yong ones which they bring forth yet in case of want of health or abilitie or any other iust impediment the mother may in equity beforborne and the child committed vnto a nurse and so we reade that rebekah the daughter of bethuel and afterward the wife of isaac had a nurse genes whose name was deborah gen and pharaohs daughter in a case of necessitie committed moses to be nursed of an hebrew woman whom she tooke not to be his mother but a stranger and her fact was allowed by god exod the second dutie of the parent is to prouide for his child meate drinke and clothing our sauiour christ saith that parents euen by the light of nature though they be euill will not denie or withhold necessarie food from their children mat what man is there among you that if his son aske him bread will giue him a stone or if he aske a fish will giue him a scorpion and paul saith if there be any that prouideth not for his owne and namely for them of his houshold hee denieth the faith and is worse then an infidell tim the third dutie is when god giueth abilitie amp meanes to lay vp some thing for the future maintenance of the child corinthian for the children ought not to lay vp for the fathers but the fathers for the children prou house and riches are the inheritance of the fathers the fourth is to obserue both the inclination and the naturall gifts of bodie and mind that are in the child and accordingly to bestow it in some honest calling amp course of life prou a child is knowne by his actions whether his worke be pure and right in the ecclesiasticall historie written by ruffinus it is recorded that alexander bishop of alexandria saw a far off in a place neare to the sea a company of children playing together and in their play imitating himselfe in sundrie ministeriall actions and whe he had a while viewed them he perceiued that they examined amp baptised one another according to the solemne order vsed in y cogregation which thing whe he had made some of his clergie acquainted withall and taken order that the children should be sent for and brought before him he demanded of them what sport they vsed and in what manner they played one with another the children at first for feare denied what they had done yet vpon further examination they confessed that they had made athanasius who afterward became bishop of the place their bishop and that hee instructed and baptised sundrie of their company he further asked both athanasius himselfe and those which were said to haue been baptised what questions he asked them and what answeres they gaue and perceiuing by their speeches that they had framed themselues though in sporting maner to the church proceedings in those actions vpon conference had with his clergie hee determined that those which had first been asked and had giuen answere fully according to the forme vsed in that church and thereupon baptised should not be rebaptised and for athanasius and the other children which had done the part of ministers in their kind he sent for their parents and gaue them great charge that they should be brought vp in learning and religion that so they might in time be fit for the publike ministerie the like course we reade to haue been taken by the heathen for iudgement of the inclination and towardnesse of their children the athenians made a law that before children were bestowed in any calling they should bee first brought into a publike place where instruments belonging to all sorts of trade were laid and look in what kind of instrument any of them tooke most delight the child was thought to bee most fit for the trade whereunto that instrument belonged and afterward applied to the same with good successe now the parents first and principall care must be for the church that those of their children which haue the most pregnant wit and be indued with the best gifts be consecrated vnto god and brought vp in the studie of the scriptures to serue afterward in the ministerie of the church thus anna dedicated samuel her son vnto god by vow sam and shee vowed a vow and said o lord of hostes if thou wiltgiue vnto thine handmaid a man child the i wil giue him vnto the lord all the daies of his life and she did according to her vow and the lord blessed samuel her son who in processe of time became a great prophet the next point of education of children is to prouide that they may liue well and lead a godly life to this purpose parents must do three things first they are to be carefull that the child so soone as may bee after it is borne bee admitted into the true church of god by baptisme and haue a fit name giuen vnto it secondly they are to endeuour to sow the seed of godlinesse and religion in the heart of the child so soone as it comes to the vse of reason and vnderstanding and as it growes in yeares so care must be had that it grow in knowledge and grace to this purpose is the vow and promise made in baptisme which parents are bound to call vpon the child to remember when it comes to yeares it was the godly care of timothies parents tim but continue thou in the things which thou hast learned knowing of whom thou hast learned them verse and that thou hast knowne the holy scriptures of a child which are able to make thee wise vnto saluation through the faith which is in christ iesus this was the commandement of god to the parents of his people deut thou shalt rehearse these words which i command thee continually to thy children and shalt talke of them whe thou tarriest in the house and verse when thy son shall aske thee in time to come saying what meane these testimonies and ordinances and lawes which the lord our god hath commanded you then thou shalt say vnto thy son we were pharaohs bondmen in egypt ampc this was obserued by the israelites in the ages cceeding psalm we haue heard with our eares o god our fathers haue told vs the workes that thou hast done in their daies in old time thirdly the first instruction of children in learning amp religion must be so ordered that they may take it with delight for which purpose they may be sometimes allowed in moderate maner to play and solace themselues in recreatios fitting for their yeares and if they do amisse in either they are to bee restrained by the bridle of discipline first by reproofe in word and when that wil not helpe by the rodde of correction zach the streets of the citie shall bee full of boyes and girles playing in the streets thereof prou the rod and correction giue wisdome but a child set at libertie makes his mother ashamed verse correct thy son and he will giue thee rest and giue pleasures to thy soule hebr we haue had the fathers of our body which correct vs and we gaue them reuerence yet in this point two extreames are carefully to be auoided that the parent be not either too seuere or too indulgent to the child for seue itie paul giues his rule ephesian parents prouoke not your children to anger that is by too much austeritie in gouernmet for lenitie we haue old eli his example sam and he said vnto them why do yee such things for of all this people i heare euill reports of you doe no more my sonnes ampc so much for education the second general dutie of parents is the bestowing of their children this bestowing is when they knowing their children fit for mariage not to haue the gift of continencie do vse their best indeuour to prouide matches for them in time or at least do aduise them therunto by themselues or by their friends corinthian if any man thinke it vncomelie for his virgin to passe the flower of her age and need so requirelet them bee married verse he that giueth her to mariage doth well ierem take yee wiuesand take wiues for your sonnes and giue your daughters to husbands ampc gen isaac called iacob and blessed him and charged him and said vnto him take not a wife of the daughters of canaan arise get thee to padan aramand thence take thee a wife of the daughters of laban thy mothers brother iudg sampson came and told his father and his mother and said i haue seene a woman in timnah of the daughters of the philistims now therefore giue me her to wife this dutie is now adaies carelessely neglected of parents and the fruit therof is dangerous for hence it comes to passe that their children oftentimes do either commit whoredome or vndertake wicked and vngodly mariages in the choice of a husband or wife the parents ought to haue a greater respect vnto pietie and wisedome then vnto beautie and riches or any other outward blessings yet where they all concurre the partie so qualified is the more thankfully to be entertained vpon these grounds the priest of prince of midian gaue his daughter zipporah to moses and moses agreed to take her exod a man of egypt deliuered vs from the philistims and also drew vs water enough amp watered the sheepeand moses agreed to dwell with the man who gaue vnto moses zipporah his daughter iosu then caleb said he that smiteth kiriath sepher and taketh it euen to him will i giue achsah my daughter to wife yes it is a sinne to marrie only for beautie without consideration of the better things thus the old world sinned whe the sonnes of god saw the daughters of man that they were faire and tooke them wiues of all that they liked gen and sampson who only vpon the sight of the woman in timnah of the daughters of the philistims without further inquirie desired that she might be giuen him for his wife iudg againe it is meet that parets should deale moderately with their children in this case and not vndertake at any hand to force and compel them to marrie this or that partie this was the iust commendation of rebekahs parents who though they were idolaters yet had that regard of equity that they first called her and asked her consent before they sent her away with abrahams servant to be maried to isaac gen now in case the parents faile in their dutie in this regard the son or daughter may lawfully declare the matter first to their kinsfolke and afterward if need be to the minister or magistrate and sue for redresse by their means and direction the son is he who is in subiection to his parents the duties of a son to bee performed to his parents are principally two first to yeeld them obedience whether they be his naturall parents or otherwise as his step father amp step mother and that while he liueth ephesians children obey your parents in the lord for this is right luke then hee went downe with them and came to nazareth and was subiect to them exod moses father in law said vnto him heare now my voice i will giue thee counsell and god shall be with thee ruth and ruth said vnto naomi her mother in law all that thou biddest me i wil do iob and whe the daies of their baquetting were gone about iob sent and sanctified them this obedience must shew it selfe in two things first in the choyce of a lawful calling wherein the child is to be ordered and appointed at the discretion of the parent secondly in mariage for in that the parent is the principall agent and disposer of the child now although his authoritie be not so great as that the child is to be forced and compelled by him yet the reuerent and dutifull respect which the child ought to beare towards him ought to be a strong inducement not to dissent or renounce his aduice without great and waightie cause yes the child must endeuour by all manner of dutifull cariage to ouercome or at least to mitigate his parents seueritie in that behalfe now for the daughters they must yeeld obedience to their parents in all domesticall labours that they may be skilfull in houshold affaires thus did the seuen daughters of the priest of midian accustome themselues to draw water and fill the troughes to water their fathers sheepe exod thus rebekah was seene to come out of her fathers house with her pitcher vpon her shoulder and to go downe with it to the well to fill it and giue drinke to her fathers camels gen the second dutie of the son is to recompence his fathers loue and care ouer him by relieuing him in case of want if god giue abilitie with food and rayment and other necessaries herein children must deale with their parents as the brood of the storke is reported to do with her by feeding her when she is old wherein they doe no more but what shee before hath done vnto them it is pauls counsell that childred amp nephewes should recompence the kindnes of their kindred in the first place tim and therefore to their parents the head amp foudation of their kindred when ioseph was in prosperitie and his father iacob in want he first gaue him corne freely and afterwards sent for him to egypt and there prouided for him in so much as the text saith of him that he nourished his father and his brother and all his fathers house hold with bread euen as the mother puts meat into the childs mouth gen when naomi the step mother of ruth was of great yeares and her strength spent ruth gathered corne in the haruest for reliefe of them both yes when boaz gaue her to eate and to drinke she reserued part of her victuals amp brought it home with her gleanes to refresh her mother ruth the necessitie of the performance of these duties is so great that if the son neglecteth them and doth the contrarie by ill vsage of his parent either in word or deed he is worthie of death euen by moses law exod he that smiteth his father or his mother shall die the death the law of the first borne of a mans children that he should haue a greater portion of his fathers goods then any of the rest of his brother is perpetuall and admits no exception but only in the case of notorious wickednes deut he shall acknowledge the son of the hated for the first borne amp giue him a double portion of all that he hath for he is the first of his strength and to him belongeth the right of the first borne this was the law yet we reade that ruben lost this prerogatiue by reason of his incest and iudah the fourth son of iacob had the dignitie of the first borne gen thou iudah thy brother shall prayse theethy fathers sonnes shall bow downe vnto thee in the church of the old testament the priuiledge of the first borne was three fold the first of gouernment and royaltie the second of priesthood the third of the double portion and it is probable that this was for the most part ceremoniall and was accomplished and determined in christ who was the image of the inuisible god amp the first borne of euery creature colos heere two questions are propounded quest i whether is it lawful for the son to make a vow belonging either to religion or to ciuill conuersation without the consent of the parent answer a vow so made is not of force to bind the child but by the law of nature amp common equitie is to be made void for it is a ruled case that he which is not his owne man that is to say at his owne libertie but vnder the power of another cannot bind himselfe againe the authoritie of the parent by the law of god is great for it alloweth the father to make void the vow of the child pertaining to god worship numb quest ii whether is the consent of the parents to be required in the second mariages of their children answer of ancient times both by c de nuptijs l vidua amp l in coiunctione ciuill lawes amp also by imperial constitutions it was prouided that no widowes though made free by their former mariages should make any contract againe without the good will of their parents consent in this case though it be not absolutely necessarie yet it is to be thought fit and conuenient because children in some regards exempted from parents authoritie doe owe notwithstanding the dutie of honor vnto them by god expresse commandement exod and consequently ought to testifie the same by being ordered and aduised by them in some sort euen at the after bestowing of themselues hence it is that beza de repud amp diuort sect de sposalibus absque consensu parfactis later diuines haue holden vpon good ground that the espousals of widowes who haue some more libertie then the child first married being made without their parents knowledge cannot but incurre iust reprehension howsoeuer they may stand in force without it next vnto parents and children wherby the family is increased is a second sort of couples which are helpes therunto and they are masters and servant the master is a member in the familie which hath power and beareth rule ouer the servant and his dutie stands principally in three things first to make a good choice of his servant which is then done when he inquireth first after such as feare god and be willing to serue him paul makes the seruice and feare of god the maine ground of true obedience in servant ephesian colos it was the rule of dauids choice psalm hee that walketh in the perfect way he shall serue me abrahams chiefe seruat of his house was a man that feared god as appeareth in that he made conscience of his oath gen and prayed also for successe in the busines whereabout he was sent gen o lord god of my master abraham i beg thee send mee good speed this day and shew mercie to my master abraham cornelius of caesarea the captaine of the italian band had a souldier that daily attended on him who feared god and servant also beside him to whom hee made knowne the heauenly vision which hee saw act secondly to enioyne them labour and not to require more of them then their strength will beare the master is to rule ouer the servant in iustice and then is his comandement vniust whe it will not stad with the course of nature with the abilitie of his servant or with the word of god therefore he is to require labour at their hads proportionable to their strength amp yeeld the sometimes intercession amp rest leuit ouer your brethen the children of israel ye shall not rule ouer one another with crueltie pet bee pitifull bee courteous one beare with another and for the furtherance of busines it is conuenient that the master be oftentimes present with the seruats in their works prou be diligent to know the state of thy flock and take heed to thy heards the good matron ouerseeth the waies of her houshold prou a man of libya being asked what it was that might make a horse fat he answered the masters eye thirdly to recompence the diligence and paines of his servant and that three waies first by giuing him his due of meat and drinke for the present the good matron giueth the portion to her houshold and the ordinary to her maids prou secondly by paying him his hire in the end of his seruice the labourer is worthie of his wages luke well done good servant and faithfull thou hast been faithfull in little i will make thee ruler ouer much enter into thy masters ioy mat heere three caueats are to be obserued i that the wages be proportionable to the work ii that it be paid in due time without deferring so the master of the vine yard when euen was come called his servant together to giue the their hire mat iii that the seruat be not defrauded of any part of his due for this is a crying sin deut thou shalt giue him his hire for his day neither shall the sun go downe vpon itlest hee crie against thee vnto the lord and it bee sinne vnto thee iam behold the hire of the labourers which haue reaped your fields which is kept backe by fraud crieth and the cries of them which haue reaped are entred into the eares of the lord of hosts thirdly if the servant in time of his seruice be sicke the masters care must be by all means possible to procure his recouery equitie must be the rule in these cases and masters are to do to their servant that which is iust and equall column now the servant haplie falles sicke by and in his seruice and his health yeelds not only profit to his master but incouragement also to himselfe the good centurion in case of his servant sicknesse tooke the best course to haue him restored matth the servant is a person in the family subiect vnto his master the dutie of a seruat is faithfully and diligetly to demeane himselfe in the affaires of his master and to doe seruice vnto him as vnto christ though he be froward and hard harted titus let servant be subiect to their masters and please them in all things not answering againe ephesian servant be obedient to them that are your masters according to the flesh with feare amp trembling in singlenes of your hearts as vnto christ column thus iacob serued laban gen this twentie yeares haue i bin with thee thine ewes and thy goates haue not cast their yong and the rammes of the flocke haue i not eaten ampc contrariwise the servant must take heed that he doe not his masters businesse negligently or for fashion sake or with eye seruice as a man pleaser that in case of rebuke or controlement he answere not againe lastly that hee be trustie amp withhold his hands from picking and his heart from deceiuing his master servant are of two sorts either free or bond servant a free servant is he whom his master hireth for wages to do him seruice to him belongs the iust paiment of his hire and in case of offence them master hath authoritie to censure and correct him prouided that in the execution thereof respect bee had vnto his age and the correction be vsed with moderation as if hee were his son a bond servant is a servant bought for money and is commonly called a slaue touching this sort a question is moued whether a christian may with safe conscience haue and vse a man as his slaue answer the power amp right of hauing bond man in those country where it is established by positiue lawes may stand with good coscience if it be vsed with moderation that authoritie in this behalfe is moderate wherein these seuen caueats be obserued i that the master haue not ouer his servant the power of life and death for this takes away the lawful power of the magistrate to whom only the lord hath committed the sword of iustice ii that there be not libertie granted him to vse his servant at his owne will and pleasure in all things for this was not granted by the law of god to his owne people exod if a man smite his servant or his maid in the eye and hath perished it he shall let him go free for his eye also if he smite out his servant or his maids tooth he shall let him go out free for his tooth iii that the power be not enlarged to the commanding of things against piety or iustice for in these cases a man must rather obey god then man act iv that masters do not take libertie to make separation of those their servant that be married the one from the other or of those that be parents from their children considering that god himselfe hath made these societies and ioyned such persons together and therefore man may not separate them v that the masters do not take libertie to put ouer their servant to vngodly and vnbelieuing masters for that is an vnkind and cruell libertie amp may be an apparat occasion to make the servant fall away from religion and renounce the true god vi that they do not bind them to perpetuall slauery amp neuer make them free exo but if the servant say thus i loue my master my wife and my children i will not go out free vii that the seruitude be not procured and retained by force for it is a more grieuous crime to spoile a man of his libertie then of his riches now y t the same power limited with these cautions is lawful amp warrantable in cosciece it appears by these reasons i god hath ordained amp allowed it euen by warrant of his owne law the posteritie of cham was cursed by noah and condemned to slauerie gen and he said cursed be cham a servant of servant shal he be to his brother so were the gibeonites by ioshua ios now therefore yee are cursed and there shall none of you be freed from being bond man and hewers of wood amp drawers of water for the house of my god so was the theefe exo if he had not wherewith to make restitution then hee should bee sold for his theft again those that are ouercome in war may be held captiue and it is lawful for the conquerer to kill them amp therefore to make them slaues and if being take they be saued from death they owe all that they haue to them by whom they are saued ii the law of god gaue libertie to any ma that would to make sale of himselfe to another leuit of the children of the strangers that are soiourners among you of them shal ye buy amp of their families that are with you which they begat in your land these shall be your possessio deut if thy brother an hebrew sell himself to thee or an hebrewesse and serue thee six yeares eue in the seuenth yeare thou shalt let him go free from thee and verse thou shalt take an aule amp pierce his eare through against the doore and he shall be thy servant for euer iii the ma that is ransommed fro his enemie is bound to serue as a slaue in liew of thankfulnesse iv the examples of the godly in the scriptures abraham had servant whom he bought for siluer gen euerie manchild of eight daies old among you shal be circumcised in your generations as well he that is borne in thine house as he that is bough with money of any stranger which is not of thy seed gen the lord hath blessed my master abraham woderfully for he hath giuen him sheep and beeues and siluer and gold amp man servant and maid servant and camels and asses v the apostles do not disallow of such seruats but comand the being servant amp called to the professio of christianitie in that state not to change but to abide in their calling corinthian article thou called being a servant care not for it it is alledged that such seruitude is against the law of nature ans it is indeed against the law of intire nature as it was before the fall but against the law of corrupted nature since the fall it is not but christ hath purchased liberty to belieuers coloss ans only a spirituall libertie in this life amp a corporal only in the life to come for though y servant in regard of faith amp the inner man be equal to his master because in christ iesus there is neither master nor seruat bond nor free yet in regard of the outward man amp ciuill order amongst man the master is aboue the servant and the servant is amp must be subiect to the master neuerthelesse where this kind of seruitude is abolished it is not to be againe receiued or intertained amongst christians specially considering it is a far more milde and moderate course to haue hired servant if it be said againe that the heathen philosopher holdeth seruitude to be naturall wherby some are by birth bond and others free i answere that seruitude proceedeth not of nature but hath his originall from the lawes of nation and is a consequent of the fall for all man by nature are equally amp indifferetly free none more or lesse then others thus much touching the diverse and seuerall combinations or couples belonging to the state oeconomicall fro which do arise two persons of a mixt or compounded nature and condition comonly called the goodman amp the goodwife of y e house the good man or master of the familie is a person in whom resteth the priuate and proper gouernment of the whole houshold and he comes not vnto it by election as it falleth out in other states but by the ordinance of god setled euen in the order of nature the husbad indeed naturally beares rule ouer the wife parents ouer their childre masters ouer their seruats but that person who by the prouidence of god hath y e place of an husband a father a master in his house the same also by the light of nature hath the principality amp soueraigntie therein and he is paterfamilias the father and chiefe head of the familie to him therefore the true right and power ouer all matters domestical of right appertaineth the duties of the master of the familie are specially fiue i to beare the chiefe stroke and to be the principal agent directer and furtherer of the worship of god within his familie ios i and my household wil serue the lord and this he doth partly by praying for amp with his houshold and partly by instructing the in the holy scriptures and in the grounds of religio that they may grow in knowledge and reape benefit by the publike ministerie thus god commanded the man of israel to walke in their families deut thou shalt rehearse them continually vnto thy children and shalt talke of them when thou tariest in thine houseamp when thou liest downe amp when thou risest vp againe verse when thy son shall aske theewhat meane these testimonies and ordinaces amp lawes which the lord our god commanded you then thou shalt say vnto thy son we were pharaohs bondmen in egypt but the lord brought vs out of egypt with a mightie hand this testimony god gaue of abraham before the law was giuen gen for i know abraham that he will command his son and his houshold after him that they keepe the way of the lord and this houshold of abraham was very large for the holy ghost saies long before that he had three hundred and eighteene ethchanicau suos initiatos that were borne and brought vp in his house gen it was in likelihood y e course of salomon which he had learned of his father dauid and giuen for a rule to al masters of families prou heare o children the instruction of a father and giue eare to learne vnderstanding for i was my fathers son deare and tender in the sight of my mother when he taught me and said vnto me let thine heart hold fast my words the company of the disciples were the household of christ and he himselfe did administer all parts of the seruice of god with them and among them luke to this purpose in ioan tract in fine augustine saith that the master of the familie doth after a sort and in his measure performe the dutie of a churchman or bishop within his house ii to bring his familie to y e church or congregation on the sabbath day to looke that they do religiously there behaue themselues amp after the publike exercises ended amp the congregation is dismissed to take account of that which they haue heard that they may profit in knowledge and obedience act the day after they entred into caesarea now cornelius waited for them amp had called together his kinsmen amp special friends verse now therefore saith cornelius to peter are we all heere present before god to heare all things that are commanded thee of god iob and when the daies of their banqueting were gone about iob sent and sanctified them amp rose vp early in the morning amp offred burnt offerings ampc king and he said wherefore wilt thou go to him to day it is neither new moone nor sabbath for this very cause the fourth comandement is giuen first of all amp principally to the master of the familie that he might see the sabbath kept and be a principal doer in all parts of god worship therein exod in it thou shalt not do any worke thou nor thy son nor thy daughter thy man servant nor thy maid nor thy cattel nor thy stranger that is within thy gates neither is this his care tied only to the sabbath but vpon other daies besides it he ought to cause them of his houshold as much as in him lieth to repaire to places where the word of god is preached commendable was the practise of marie the sister of martha in this case who when christ came to her house is said to sit at his feete and attend vnto his preaching luke iii to prouide for his family meat drinke and clothing and that they may liue a quiet amp peaceable life tim pro the lambs are for thy clothing and the goats for the price of thy field v and let the milke of thy goats be sufficient for thy food for the food of thy familie and for the sustenance of thy maids corinthian thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the oxe that treadeth out the corne doth god care for oxen either saith he it not altogether for our sakes matth euery scribe which is taught vnto the kingdome of heauen is like vnto an housholder that brings forth out of his treasurie things both new and old iv to keepe order and to exercise discipline in his house and that in this manner in case of offence when a capitall crime is committed which incurreth publike censure he is not to punish it himselfe but to bring the offender to the ciuill magistrate to informe of his fault that he may haue his desert it was a course established by the iudicial law which god gaue vnto moses for his direction in causes criminall among the israelites deut if any man hath a son that is stubborne amp disobedient which wil not hearken vnto the voice of his father nor the voice of his mother and they haue chastened him then shal his father and his mother take him and bring him out vnto the elders of his citie and vnto the gate of the place where he dwelleth and shall say vnto the elders of his citie this our son is stubborne and disobedient and he will not obey our admonition hee is a rioter and a drunkard againe deut if thy brother the son of thy mother or thine own son or thy daughter or the wife that lieth in thy bosome or thy friend which is as thine owne soul entise thee secretly saying let vs go and serue other god which thou hast not known thou i say nor thy fathers thou shalt not consent vnto him nor heare neither shal thine eye pitie nor shew mercie nor keepe him secret zach and when any shall yet prophesie his father and his mother that begate him shall say vnto him thou shalt not liue for thou speakest lies in the name of the lord and his father and his mother that begate him shall thrust him thorough when he prophesieth if the fault be of an inferiour nature and less in comparison the master of the familie ought to proceed by priuate censure vpon the delinquent partie sometimes by admonitio otherwhiles by correction and chastisement according to the quality of the offence amp the condition amp state of the person leuit thou shalt plainly rebuke thy neighbour and not suffer him to sin mat if thy brother sinne against thee go and tell him his fault betweene him and thee alone if he heare thee not take yet with thee one or two prou correct thy son and he will giue thee rest and will giue pleasures to thy soule when admonitions and corrections will not preuaile the partie must bee brought before the ministers and gouernours of the church that they may censure him matth if he will not heare them tell it vnto the church and the apostle iames giueth order that the ministers of the church should come to those that are sicke and pray for them iames which if they doe in case of infirmitie then they are also to be sought vnto in case of errour and offence committed for redresse but when none of all these meanes will do good if the partie be a servant his master may and ought to remoue him psalm there shall no deceitfull person dwell within mine house he that telleth lies shall not remaine in my sight ioh the servant abideth not in the house for euer v to giue intertainment to those that are strangers amp not of the familie if they be christians and belieuers but specially to the ministers of the word rom giuing your selues to hospitalitie hebr be not forgetfull to lodge strangers for hereby some haue receiued angels into their houses vnawares this duty the woman of shunem amp her husband performed vnto the prophet elisha king let vs make him a little chaber i pray thee with walles and let vs set him a bed there and a table and a stoole and a candlesticke that he may turne in hither when he commeth to vs these are the duties heere if it be demanded whether the master of a familie is alway and necessarily bound in his owne person to doe all these things i answere that if there be iust and necessarie cause either in respect of his owne inabilitie or in regard of publike imployment vpon a lawful calling whereby he is hindred so as he cannot do any of them himselfe at some times it is lawful for him to haue and vse a deputy this our sauiour christ teacheth in effect when he saith who then is a faithfull servant and wise whom his master hath made ruler ouer his houshold to giue them meate in season mat thus abraham had a steward of his house eliezer of damascus gen and he performed the waightiest matters that concerned the establishment and continuance of familie not by himselfe but by his steward as namely the choice of a wife for his son isaac gen therefore abraham said vnto his eldest servant of his house which had the rule ouer all that hee had put now thine hand vnder my thigh ampc thus pharaoh king of egypt had ioseph gen so ioseph found fauour in his sight and serued him and hee made him ruler of his house and put all that he had in his hands the goodwife or mistresse of the house is a person which yeeldeth helpe and assistance in gouernmet to the master of the familie for he is as it were the prince and chiece ruler she is the associate not only in office and authoritie but also in aduise and counsell vnto him king and after these things the son of the woman which was wife or bagnalath babbaijth domina domus mistresse of the house was sicke her dutie is two fold first to gouerne the house as much as concerneth her in her place tim i will therefore that the yonger woman marrie and gouerne the house and that she doth three waies i by exercising her selfe in some profitable employments for the good of her charge prou she seeketh wooll and flax and laboureth cheerefully with her hands ii by appointing her maids their worke and ouerseeing them therein verse she riseth whiles it is yet night and giueth the portion to her houshold and the ordinary to her maids iii by ordering her children and servant in wisdome partly by instruction partly by admonition whe there is need verse shee openeth her mouth with wisdome and the law of grace is in her tongue verse her children rise vp and call her blessed ampc tit that they be discreet chast keeping at home ampc act priscilla in her house with aquila instructed apollos in that wherin he was wanting expounding vnto him the way of god more perfectly gregorie nazianzen in an oration made for his father saith that his mother was not only an helper but also a teacher or instructer and guide vnto his father in matters of religion amp godlines the second dutie is to giue the portion of food vnto her familie or cause it to be giuen in due season prou she riseth whiles it is yet night and giueth the portio or meat to her houshold thus did rebekah in her house gen get thee now to the flock amp bring me thece two good kids of the goats that i may make pleasant meat of the for thy father such as he loueth quest whether may the goodwife without the consent of the goodman giue and bestow the goods belonging to the familie ans i there are some things which are proper to her selfe and not part of her dowry which she brought vnto her husband and these she may claime as her owne because either they were reserued vpon the match made betweene them or else are peculiar vnto her by their mutuall consent and of them she may lawfully giue without her husbands knowledge ii the goods which are common to them both are of another nature and these shee may not bestow without his allowance either expresse or at least general and implicite specially when the giuing of them doth or may grow in likelihood to the hinderance and preiudice of the state of the familie

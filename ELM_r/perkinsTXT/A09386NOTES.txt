The same doe other Summ 1 par quae 23 art 5 Schoolmen affirme in e midst of Papacie Gregorius Ariminensis laieth downe sixe conclusios cocerning Predestination First that there is no bodie predestinated for the well vsing of freewill which God forknew that he should haue Secondly that no man is predestinaed because he was foreknowne to cotinue to the end without Cont Gent lib 1 c 44 any let of habitual grace 3 That whomsoeuer God predestinated m hee did predestinate freely purposedlie and of his pure mercie Fourthly that no man is reiected for the euill vsing of freewill which God foresaw he would be tainted with Fiftly that there is not any reiected because hee was foreknowne to haue finally an impedimet of diuine grace Sixtlie that whomsoeuer God reiected him hee did reiect without anie cause in him The very same conclusions hath Petrus de Alliaco lib 1 sent quaest 12 art 2 and Marsilius of Inghen lib 1 dist 42 q 4 Some of whose words I will set downe He is predestinated saith he to whom God hath purposed to giue euerlasting life And he is reiected on whom God hath determined not to bestow the same as the Apostle teacheth Rom 9 Againe No man that is predestinated is predestinated for any thing which should bee in him in time to come so also there is no reprobate reiected for any cause which was to be in him in time to come And euery one that is predestinate is predestinated only by grace  by Gods mercifull disposition not for any cause either actuall or priuatiue to bee found in him whiles hee liueth Againe To reiect is to nill to shewe mercie and this is not for the euill workes of In sent lib 1 quae 22 art 2 any creature for how holy soeuer the workes were God would shew mercie as he listed So also Francis Mar lib x q 31 art 2 3 saith that there are foure signes necessarie for the vnderstading of the proceeding of predestination and reprobation First in which Peter  Iudas are offred to the diuine will as to neither of the both And hen the diuine will  preordaine Pter vnto glie but it had no posine act about Iudas according to uustine The second sgne is in which hee preordained Peter to grace and the he had o posiue act as yet about Iudas The thd signe  in which they are left to themselues and bot o them doe fall into sinne The fourth sgne is that in which Peter riseth againe or he cannot continue because he is predestinated by the first signe But Judas riseth not againe because he hath not God to raise him vp therefore hee is reiected D Bannes in 1 Thom q 23 The cause and reason of the whole worke of reprobation cannot be said to bee in the reprobates for sinne it selfe cannot be the cause of that pennission of sinne for which a man is damned whether it bee originall or actuall as it appeareth in infants who die only with originall sinne which verely howsoeuer it may be the cause why infants are forsaken in it yet neuerthelesse it cannot bee the cause and reason why the whole nature of man should be suffered to fall in Adam And Ferrariensis in Thom cont Gent pag 603 saith that foure things are found in a reprobate to wi a sufferance to fall into sinne the sin it selfe Gods forsaking not raising him from sin and the punishment or damnation Now reprobation is not alike but diuersly affected to all these For if we consider sinne in it self reprobation is not caused by iAlthough nothing on our parts to wit no worke of ours bee the cause of the whole work of reprobatio for of al these together namely of the permission forsaking and punishment the manifestation of Gods iustice is the alone cause considering that no worke of ours is the cause of the permission yet notwithstanding our wicked working or sinne is the cause why wee are damned and punished Againe We denie that God is cruell for we say that God doth not punish and torment the reprobate for the fulfilling as it were of his owne fancie but for sinne eternally foreknowne which he determined so to dispose of by punishing of it that his iustice might be made manifest

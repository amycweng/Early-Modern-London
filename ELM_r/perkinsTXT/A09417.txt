the prophet in the first chapter of this prophesie rebuketh the iewes of three notable crimes idolatry fraude and crueltie in this second he exhorts them to repentance and withall reprooueth some of their speciall sinnes in the three first verses hee propoundeth the doctrine of repentance and addeth some speciall reasons to mooue and stirre them vp to the practise of it in propounding the doctrine of repentance he directs it to two sorts of man first to the obstinate and impenitent iewes in the first and second verses secondly to the better sorte of them in the third so that the summe and substance of these twoo first verses is a briefe and summarie propounding of the doctrine of repentance to the obstinate iewes the wordes containe in them fiue seuerall points touching the doctrine of repentance the dutie to bee performed search who must be searched your selues who must doe it the iewes who are further described to be a nation not worthy to be beloued of god these are in the first verse in the second verse the time limitting them when to repent before the decree come forth that is before god put in execution the iudgements which are alreadie decreed amp appointed for them a forcible reason vrging them to do it which lieth hid and is necessarilie implyed in the pointe namely that there is a decree against them which wants nothing but execution which also shall come vnlesse they repent wherby they shal be fanned amp if they shal be found to be chaff they shal flie away with the winde of god iustice of all these points in order for the first the holy ghost saith search your selues the wordes are commonly read thus gather your selues which though it bee good for that in repentance a man gathereth himselfe amp all his wits together which afore were dispersed amp wandred vp and downe in vanitie yet i rather allowe their translation who reade thus search or fanne your selues but either of them may stand because the word in the originall doth comprehend both significations yet it seemeth that to search or sift fits this place better considering the same manner of speech is afterwardes continued in the word chaffe so that the meaning of the holy ghost seemeth to be this search try and fanne your selues least you bee found light chaffe and so flie away and be consumed before the iustice of god concerning this dutie of searching let vs obserue first that the holy ghost vrging the iewes to repent vseth not the word repentance but bids them search themselues yet meaning he wold haue them to repent giuing vs to vnderstand that no man can haue true amp sound repentance but he who hath first of all searched and examined him selfe and this stands with good reason for no man can repent who first of all doeth not knowe himselfe and his owne wretchednes but no man can see into himselfe nor know himselfe but hee that doeth diligentlie search himselfe so that the beginning of all grace is for a man to search amp trie and fan himselfe that therby he may knowe what is in himselfe that so vpon the searche seeing his fearefull and damnable estate hee may forsake himselfe and his owne wayes and turne to the lord thus speaketh the holie ghost in the heartes of holie man let vs searche and trye our wayes and marke what followeth and turne againe to the lord as though there were no turning againe vnto the lord but after a searching of our selues with this testimony of the holy ghost agreeth the testimonie of all holy mens consciences who all know that the first beginning of their turning vnto the lorde was a searching of themselues let any repentant sinner aske his conscience amp call to minde his first calling and conuersion and hee will remember that the first thing in his repentance was this that he searched into himselfe and looked narrowly into his wayes and finding his wayes dangerous amp his case fearful did thervpo resoule to take a new course amp turn to the lord for pardo amp mercy and for grace to enter into more holie and more comfortable courses the man that passeth vpon ridges of mountaines and sides of hills or that goeth ouer a narrow bridge or some dangerous and steepe rocks at midnight feareth not because he seeth no danger but bring the same man in the morning and let him see the narrowe bridge hee went ouer in the night vnder which runnes a violent streame and a bottomlesse gulfe and the daungerous mountaines and rockes hee passed ouer and hee will woonder at his owne boldenesse and shrincke for feare to thinke of it and will by no meanes venture the same way againe for now he seeth the height of the mountaines the steepenesse of the hils the cragginesse of the rocks the fearefull downfall and the furious violence of the streame vnderneath and thereby seeth the extreame danger which afore he saw not therefore he wondreth and reioyceth that hee hath escaped so great a daunger and will by no meanes bee drawne to goe that waye in the day which he went most carelesly in the darknesse of the night but seeketh another way though it should bee far about so a sinner in his first estate which is naturall and corrupt as wee are bred and borne hath a vaile before his face so that he seeth nothing the wrath of god and the curse due for sin hell amp damnation seeking to deuoure him hee seeth them not although liuing alwaies in sin he walketh in the very iawes of hell it selfe and because he seeth not this fearefull daunger therefore he refuseth no sin at all but rusheth securely into all manner of sinne the night of impenitencie and the myst of ignoraunce so blinding his eyes that hee seeth not the narrow bridge of this life from which if hee slyde hee falles immediately into the bottomlesse pitte of hell but when as god spirit hath by the light of god word opened his eyes and touched his heart to consider his estate then hee seeth the fraile bridge of this narrowe life and howe little a steppe there is betweene him and damnation then hee seeth hell open due for his sinnes and himselfe in the high way to it sinne beeing the craggy rocke and hell the gaping gulfe vnder it this life beeing the narrowe bridge and damnation the streame that runneth vnder it then he wondereth at his miserable estate admireth the mercie of god in keeping him from falling into the bottome of hell wondereth at the presumptuous boldnesse of his corruption which so securely plodded on towards destruction and being ashamed of himselfe and these his wayes he turnes his heart to the god that saued him from these dangers and sets himselfe into more holie wayes and more comfortable courses and confesseth that ignorace made him bold and blindnes made him so presumptuous but nowe he seeth the danger amp will by no meanes goe the same way againe amp thus the searching and seeing into the foulenes of sinne and the danger therof is the first beginning of repentance and the first step into grace this doctrine teacheth vs what faith and repentance is generally in the world all man say they belieue and haue repented long ago but trie it well and wee shall finde in the bodie of our nation but a lippe faith and a lippe repentance for euen when they say so they are blind and ignorant of their own estate and knowe not themselues that because they are baptized and liue in the church therefore they are in god fauour amp in verie good estate when as they neuer yet were reconciled to god and are so farre from it that they neuer yet sawe anie sinnes in themselues whereof they should repent as a man trauelling in the night seeth no daunger but plods on without feare so the most part of our common people in the night of their ignorance thinke and presume they loue and feare god and loue their neighbour and that they haue euer done so nay it is the common opinion that a man may doe so by nature and that he is not worthy to liue who doth not loue god with all his heart and beleeue in iesus christ but alas poore simple soules they neuer knewe what sinne was neuer searched nor sawe into their owne hearts with the light of god law for if they had they should haue seene such a sea of corruption that then they woulde confesse it to be the hardest thing in the world to loue god amp to beleeue in christ and forsake sinne it is therefore manifest that they haue not yet begunne to beleeue or repent nor haue entered into the first step of grace which leadeth to repentance for that they haue not learned this lesson which the prophet teacheth that is to search themselues furthermore let vs in the second place obserue better the signification of the word it signifieth to searche narrowely as a man would doe for a peece of gold or a precious iewell which is lost in a great house or as a man may searche for golde in a mine of the earth where is much earth and but very little golde oare heere wee may learne that in true repentance and conuersion wee must not search so onely as to find the grosse and palpable sinnes of our liues but so as wee may finde those sinnes which the world accounts less sinnes and espie our secret saults amp priuie corruptions some corruptios seeme more neere a kin of our nature amp therein man hope to bee excused when they forsake many other greater sinnes but a true penitent sinner must search for such so as a good magistrate searcheth for a lurking traitor which is conueied into some close and secret corner and he must ransacke his heart for such corruptions as wherin his heart takes speciall delight and must thinke that no sinne can be so small but it is too great to bee spared and that euery sin great or litle must be searched for as beeing all traitors to god maiestie but alas the practise of the world is far otherwise great sinnes are little sinnes little sinnes are no sinnes nay after a little custome great sins are so little or nothing and so at last man make no bones of grosse and grieuous sinnes and for the most parte man search so superficiallie that they scarce finde any thing to be sinnes such excuses are made such distinctions are deuised such mittigations such qualifications such colours are cast vpon all sins as now vp amp downe the world grosse sinnes are called into question whether they bee sins or no amp the great trangressions of the law are couted small matters necessarie euils or inconueniences tollerated to auoyd other euils and what is hee counted but a curious and precise foole which stands vpon them ignorance after fiue and thirtie yeares preaching is counted no sinne blinde deuotion in god seruice no sinne lippe labour in praying vaine and customable swearing mocking of religion and the professours thereof no sinne prophaning of the sabbaoth contemning of preachers abusing of parentes no sinne pride in apparell superfluitie in meates beastly amp ordinarie drunkennes fornication no sinnes nay deceits cosonages oppressing vsurie notorious briberie and couetousnesse that mother sinne these are counted no sinnes these beames are made but moates by prophane man amp they are so minced and carued or there is some such necessitie of them or some such other flourish or varnish must bee cast vpon them as that they are little or none at all alas alas is not that a simple and a silly searche where such blockes as these are lye vnespyed what are moul hilles when such mountains are not seene moates wil be little regarded where such beames are not discerned but it is cleere that therefore there is no true tryall nor diligent search made for a true couert wil search his hart for all and will spare none he deales in searching his own heart as a good iustice of peace in searching for traitors or seminarie priests hee seekes not superficially but most exactly amp leaueth neuer a corner vnsought and he thinkes great sinnes to be infinit and little sinnes great and iudgeth no sin so small but that it deserueth the anger of god and therefore he wonders at the mercy of god which throwes vs not all downe to hell in a moment and hee crieth out with holy ieremie it is the lord mercie that wee are not consumed away then with this superficiall and hypocriticall search where so many sins are spared and not found out it is pharisaicall for euen so the pharisie when he came into the temple to recken with god and to tell what traytors hee hadde found that is what sins vpon good search he had espied he returnes his precept all is well hee hath found neuer a one but begins to thank god that he was so good amp so good and not so ill and so ill nor yet like the publicane the world is full of pharisies not onely the popish churche but euen our church swarmes with these superficiall searches who cannot because they wil not finde any sinne to present vnto god man thinke in the countrey a church officer hazards his oath if he present all well and findeth no faulte in his parish to present as punishable to the ordinary for man think it vnpossible that there should bee none in a whole parish then how doth that man hazard his owne soule who being made ouerseer amp searcher of his heart findes nothing in it to present to the lord for it is no more easie to espye outward and actuall transgressions in a whole parish then it is to find a heape of corruptions in a mans heart if a man will search into the bottome of it with the light of god lawe therefore when the lord comes and keepes his visitation what shall become of such a man but to vndergoe the strict amp seuere search of the almightie because hee would not search himselfe our body amp liues are free fro spanish inquisition which is one of the last proppes which sathan hath lent the pope wherewith to vpholde his declining kingdome and the lord grant we may be euer free from it but in the meane time that might put vs in mind how to deale with our corrupt heartes and vnmortified affections euen to erect an inquisition ouer them to lay in wayte for them to search them narrowly and to vse them roughly yes to set our hearts vpon the racke of god lawe that so it may confesse the secrete wickednesse of it for the papistes dooe not thincke vs protestant greater enemy to their superstition then the inwarde corruptions of our hearts are to our saluation therefore it may bee a godly pollicie for euery man euen to erect an inquisitio ouer his owne heart and conscience and not to spare his most secret amp dearest sins and such as are neerest allyed to his owne nature for that is the true search heere commaunded by the prophet amp practised by all godlie and holie man when a man purposeth to finde all that are amp to espie euen all his sinnes for a godly man is neuer satisfied in his searche but still the more he findes hee suspects the more are still behinde and therefore he continueth ing his owne heart all his life long therefore let euerie professor looke to it between god and his conscience that he dallie not with himselfe in this case for it hee doe then when god comes with his priuie searche his hypocrisie shall bee discouered and his nakednes shalbe laid open in the view of man and angels to his eternall confusion thirdly search saith the prophet but not so content hee forceth it againe euen search you in thus repeating and vrging this exhortation the holie ghost giues them and vs to vnderstand that the true searching of a mans heart and life is a dutie of a great moment and speciall necessity therefore he leaues it not after once naming it but inforceth it the seconde time as beeing no matter of indifferencie but of great necessitie thereby shewing that it is a principall dutie in repentance euen the beginning and foundation of all true grace and further it is a meanes also to preuent god iudgements for when man search not themselues then god sendes the fire of afflictions and crosses to trie and search them but when they search themselues then god spareth to searche them by his iust iudgements nowe in that this dutie of searching is both the beginning of all true grace and the meanes to staye god iudgements and therefore is so pithelie and forceablie vrged by the holie ghost it must teach vs all a necessarie lesson namely to make great conscience of searching our selues first because god hath so commanded and we are to make conscience of obedience to euerie commandement secondly because thereby we shall reape two so great commodity as first therby we shal lay a sure foundation for the good worke of grace in vs and secondly shal stay the hand of god and his iudgements from beeing executed vpon vs let vs therfore hearken to this counsaile of the holie ghost let vs take the fanne of the law and there with searche and winnow our hearts and liues our hearts for secret and hidden corruptions our liues for committing of euill and omitting of good doe with your hearts as man doe with their wheate they will not suffer their corne to lye long in the chaffe least the chaffe hurt it but commits it to the fanne that the winde may separate them so the graces of god in our hearts are but corne our sinnes and corruptions are chaffe looke well and thou shalt finde in thy selfe much chaffe and but little corne let not then the chaffe lye too long mingled with the corne lest it corrupt the corne let not thy sinnes lye mingled with the grace of god in thee if thou doe they will choke it in the ende and so depriue thee of all grace therefore rippe vp thy heart and looke into thy life and when thou hast sinned enter into thy selfe aske thy conscience what thou hast done and bee not quiet till thou hast founde out thy sinne and the foulenesse of it and neuer thinke that thou knowest anie thing in religion till thou knowest what is in thine owne heart and what are in thy speciall and priuiest corruptions and looke into thine owne faults not with a partiall eye but with a censorious and a straite iudgement spare sinne in no man but especiallie condemne it in thy selfe but alas these times of ours crie out of an other state for euen ieremies case is ours we may complaine as hee did no man repents him of his wickednes saying what haue i done the same is the force of our people and the sickenesse of all nation that euerie man runnes on in his sinnes from sin to sinne carelesly euen as the barde horse into the battaile but how rare a thing is it to finde a man that daylie searcheth himselfe and examines how he liues and how the case standeth betwixte god and himselfe and that when hee hath done amisse entereth into the closet of his heart and strikes himselfe vpon the breast and disputes the case with himselfe saying what haue i done o what is this that i gaue done against god against his church and against my own soule the want of this is that which the prophete complaines of in that place not as though it was sufficient thus to doe in a mans owne conscience but because it is a good beginning and a step to further grace for if a man did seriously thus deale with his conscience after his sinne his conscience woulde shape him such an aunswere and woulde tell him so roundlie what hee had done that hee woulde take heede howe he did the same againe and looke more narrowely and warilie to himselfe all the dayes of his life seeing therefore it is so necessarie a dutie let euery one of vs enduour the practise of it namely to rippe and ransacke our heartes and to searche our wayes vnto the bottome now for our better instruction and furtherance in the performance heereof you must knowe that this search is to bee made by the law of god for nothing else but god lawe can helpe vs and let vs see that which we must search for for if we search by anie meanes wee may seeke and search long enough ere wee finde anie thing that will bee matter of repentance aske the diuell hee will tell thee all is well and that thou article in an excellent estate and god loues thee and thou article sure of heauen this song the diuell alwayes singes for the most part til a man comes to die for then hee appeares in his colours but till then hee laboures to sing and lull all man a sleepe in the cradle of securite aske your owne flesh and your owne heartes and natures and they will aunswere and say that all is well and safe and that wee haue beleeued and loued and feared god all our dayes aske the worlde and man in the world and they will answere all is well and they will say further that thou article a right good fellowe and article worthe twentie of these curious fooles that sticke vpon points and stand vpon circumstances as swearing and drink and good fellowship and gaming and such other nice and circumstantiall points thus wil worldly man aunswere for thy prophane course is acceptable to them because thereby thou approuest the same in them nay goe further and aske all humaine learning in the world and it cannot tell thee what one sinne is nor what it is to offende god so that there remaines onely the law of god the light whereof will disclose the darkenesse of our heartes and the iustice whereof will reueale the righteousnesse and the peruersenesse of our natures therefore to the lawe of god must wee flye to helpe vs in this search and yet for our better helpe in this dutie and that there may bee nothing wanting to that soule that seeketh god therefore wee are further to knowe that if wee will searche our selues by the lawe profitablie wee must marke three rules the truth whereof vnlesse wee knowe acknowledge and feele wee shall neuer see our owne estate nor profit by this search but plod on from sin to sin vntill we plunge into hell the first rule is that euerie man that came from adam sinned in the sinne of adam thou must therefore knowe that his sinne in eating the forbidden fruit was thy sinne and thou sinnedst therein as well as hee though thou wast then vnborne and that thou article guiltie of it before god and must aunswere for it to god iustice vnlesse christ doe it for thee the reason heereof is because wee are his seede and posteritie wee were then in his loynes he was the father of vs all and was not a priuate man as wee are now but a publike person the pledge of all mankinde and bare the person of vs all at that time therefore what hee did then he did it for himselfe and for vs what couenant god made with him was made for himself amp vs what god promised him and hee to god he promised for himselfe amp for vs what he receiued for himselfe and for vs and what hee gained or lost by his fall he gained amp lost for vs as for himselfe hee lost the fauour of god and originall puritie therefore he lost it for all his posteritie guiltinesse and god anger and corruption of nature which hee gained he got for vs all as well as for himselfe if we doubt of this pointe it is prooued by the apostle where the holie ghost saith sinne entred by one man and death by sinne and that sinne went ouer all and that it went ouer all them which sinned not in the like transgression with adam that is euen our children who as they are borne are borne not onely tainted with original corruption but guilty also of adams sinne this is a most certaine truth thogh it seeme strange for few man thinke of it that euer they shall answere for adams sinne and therefore if anie obiect what reason is there that i answere for another mans sinne i answere true if it had beene adams sinne alone but it was his and thine also for hee was thy father and stood in thy roome and thou also since thou wast borne hast confirmed what hee did now therefore though not one of many thinkes seriouslie thereof namely that hee shoulde stand guiltie of a sinne committed fiue thousand yeares before hee was borne yet seeing it is most true both in scripture and good reason let euerie man subscribe in his conscience to this truth and let this bee thy first resolution in this searche that thou standest guiltie of ad ms transgression the second rule to bee knowne is that in euery man is all sinnes more plainely that in euerie man by nature are the seedes of all sinnes and that not in the worste but in the best natured man make choyse of the best man and the greatest sinne and that worst sinne is to bee founde in that best man if anie doubte of this let him consider what originall sinne is namely a corruption of the powers of our soules and that not of some or in part but of all amp wholly this corruptio hath two partes first a want not of some but of all good inclination a want of all goodnes secondly a depriuation and pronenesse not to some but to all evil amp not a pronenes onely but originall sinne infuseth into euery mas heart the seede of all corruption manie man stand much vpon their good meaning and vpright heart and bragge of a good nature but they are foulely deceiued for take the ciuilest man vpon the earth and the seedes of all sinnes in the worlde are in him by nature but to explain this point fully obserue these clauses first i say not the practise of all sinnes but the seedes for all man practise not all sinne the seedes are in their nature but the practise is restrained sometime by education sometime by good and wholsome lawes somtime the constitution of mens body deny the practise of som sins somtime the country a man dwelles in or calling a man liues in keepes him from the practise of some sinnes and alwayes a generall and limitting grace of god restrains the nature of all man from running into manie sinnes which hand of god if god should take away and leaue euerie man to his nature wee should see that euerie man would practise anie sinne in the world yes euen the greatest sinnes that euer wee heard to bee done in the world all man which knowe themselues knowe this to be true and the more a man knowes his owne heart the more hee seeth that his heart is a sea of all wickednesse and that it is the mercie and grace of god that hee hath not fallen into the mightiest and most monstrous sinnes in the world secondly i say by nature for i knowe by good education and by grace it is otherwise grace rectifieth nature but that is no thankes to nature for it is as euill and corrupt still beeing seuered from grace and therefore nature must bee fullie abolished afore man come to heauen and yet though all this be true i say not that sin breakes out in all natures alike though all natures bee alike corrupt for the course of nature is restrained in some more then others by the meanes aforesaide but this is the truth that whereas some are not so angrie some not so wanton some not so cruell some not so couetous some not so ambitious ampc as others that comes not from anie goodnesse of nature in them aboue the other originallie but from god hand which tempereth restraineth and moderateth euerie mas nature as he seeth good and if god did not thus moderate amp restraine the natures of man but suffer them to break out to the full there would then bee no order but all confusion in the worlde therefore as especiallie for his churches quietnes so also for the preseruatio of publike peace and the vpholding of societie in the worlde betweene man and man the lord holds a hand ouer euerie mans nature and keepes euery one in a certaine compasse limited by the wisdome of his power which restraining hand of his if the lord should take away all societies and common wealthes woulde bee turned vp side downe because euerie man by the vniuersall corruption of his nature would breake out into euery sinne i ende this point with appealing to the testimonie of the consciences of all man and especiallie of the best and holyest man of whom i would aske this question whether they finde not in their natures an inclination euen to the fowlest sinnes in the worlde if shame or feare or else the grace of god restrained them not so that the best man doe know well enough what adooe they haue with their corrupt natures to keep them within the compasse of obedience nay i yet adde further the nature of man amp of all man is so corrupt since adam that euen the seede of the sinne against the holy ghost amp a pronenesse to it is in the nature of euery man though not one man amongst manie thousandes doe commit that sin for seeing in that sinne there is a heape or sea of all sinnes gathered together he therefore that hath in his nature the seede of all sinnes hath also the seede of it and againe seeing that all euills tendes to a perfection as well as grace doeth what reason therefore is there but wee may safely thinke that the diuell would hale euery one to that height of sinne if it were not that the powerfull hande of god preuented him who will neyther suffer wicked man nor the diuell himselfe to bee so wicked as they coulde and would be the vse of this second rule is notable for in this searching of our selues it sheweth vs what wee are without all colour or deceit and fully discouers vnto vs the vglines of our natures amp it may teach vs all how to think and esteeme of our selues when we heare of caines vnnaturall murther pharaohs vnnaturall crueltie the sodomites vnnatural lust achitophels diuellish pollicie senacharibs horrible blasphemie iudas monstrous treason iulians fearefull apostasie when wee heare of the fearefull murthers treasons periuries sinnes against nature blasphemies apostasies witchcrafts crafts and other the horrible sinnes of the worlde let vs then returne into our selues and looke homewardes euen into our owne heartes and confesse euerie one that these should haue beene euen thy sinnes also if god grace had not preuented thee this will humble thee and make thee thinke vilely and basely of thy selfe and so consequently bring thee to repentance and true amendement and the verie reason why man repent not nor amend their wayes is because they are pharisies by nature and thinke highly of themselues and of their owne natures and their naturall inclinations this will be a harshe amp a strage doctrine to them oh they haue excellent narures and they canot endure such amp such sinnes and they thanke god they are not as ill as others but let all such man knowe they must cease magnifying nature amp learne to magnifie god grace let them knowe that nature in them is in the roote as much corrupt as in the worst man in the world and euerie mans heart is a bottomlesse fountaine of all sinne therefore praise not thy nature but god grace and mercie in giuing thee so good a nature or rather so well restraining and rectifying thy nature amp stay not there but desire of the lord that as hee hath giuen thee a better tempered nature then to other man so also hee woulde bestowe on thee his espeiiall and sauing grace and as hee hath kept thee from the fearefull sinnes of others thou beeing as ill naturally as they so he would also leade thee into the way of saluation which else the best nature in the worlde can neuer attaine vnto the third rule to be knowne and practised of him who will truely searche himselfe is that euerie man borne of adam is by nature the children of wrath and god enemie this is true of all without exception high or lowe rich or poore noble or simple borne in the visible church or without and further by beeing enemie of god hee is therefore borne subiect to hell to damnation and to all other curses so that looke as a traitor conuicted stands thereby in his princes high displeasure and is sure of death without speciall pardon so standes euerie man when hee is borne conuicted of high treason against god in his high disfauour and is in danger of hell which is the fulfilling of the wrath of god thus dauid confesseth of himselfe i was borne in iniquitie and in sinne hath my mother conceiued mee if in sinne then in god wrath and vnder the daunger of damnation if anie aske howe or why this is so i answere the trueth as also the equitie of this third rule dependeth on the two former for because euery man is borne guiltie of adams great sinne and also tainted originally with al corruption and a pronenesse of all sinne therefore it followeth in equitie and iustice that euery man is borne vnder the wrath and curse of god this point is a plaine and euident trueth yet man in the world thinke not so and it is the cause why man repent not of their sinnes for most man thinke that by nature they are in god fauour and therefore they neede not so sue for it in humiliation amp repentance but only liue ciuillie and do no open wrong and all is well whereas alas there is no condemned traitour more out of his princes fauour nor more sure of death without a pardon then all wee are out of god fauour and sure of damnation vnlesse wee procure god fauour againe by faith and repentance for the better opening of this third rule and the manifesting of the truth let vs knowe further that the curse of god vnder the which wee all are borne is three fold the first is a bondage vnder sathan it is a certaine truth that euerie man as hee is borne of his parents and till he repent is a slaue of sathan man or woman high or lowe sathan is his lord and maister hee sits as iudge in his heart and in his sense sathan is the king of the natios and god of the world man wil in words defie sathan and not name him without defiance and spit at him and yet alas hee is in their heartes they spitte him out of their mouthes but hee is lower they should also spit him out of their heartes and that is true defiance indeede for alas he lodgeth in thy heart and there hee maketh his throne and reignes vntil the spirit of regeneration dispossesse him and till then no servant is subiect to his maister no slaue to his lorde as is the heart of man by nature vnto sathan the prince of darkenesse nay our bondage is more fearefull then the slauerie of anie poore christian in the spaniard or in the turkes gallies for their body are but in bondage and at commaund and vnder punishment but our best part our heart our conscience our soule it selfe is captiuated vnto him and vnder his commaunde who is the king of crueltie and confusion and lord of hell whose commandements are iniustice whose seruice is sinne and whose hyre is damnation the second part of the curse of the first death or the death of the bodie that is a separation of the soule and bodie asunder for a time namely til the last iudgemet this death is duely and iustly the punishment of anie one or the least sinne therefore howe due and iust a punishment vppon that horrible heape of sinfulnesse which is in euery mans nature and it is a most terrible curse for it is the very gate of hell and the downefall of damnation vnto all man but such as by faith and repentance doe get their death sanctified by the death of christ vnto such man indeed it is no curse but a gratious and glorious blessing for it is altered by christ his death but vnto all man by nature and which repent not it is the heauie curse of god wrath and the verie downe fall into the gulfe of hell the third part of the curse vnder which euerie man is borne is the second death the death of soule and bodie which is the eternall want of god presence and the accomplishment of his wrath and an apprehension and feeling of that wrath seazing on bodie soule and conscience the first curse was a spirituall death the death of the soule the second a temporall death the death of the bodie the third is an eternall death a death both of soule and bodie together and for euer this eternall death is the curse of all curses the miserie of all miseries and torment of all tormentes and i shewe it thus often when thy toothe acheth and sometime when thy headacheth or in the paine of the stone or collicke thou wouldest giue all that thou hast in the worlde to bee eased of that paine nay in the extreamitie of some fittes manie will wish themselues euen out of the world now if the paine of one toothe can so farre distemper minde and bodie that it cannot bee releeued with all the pleasures of this life oh then what a torment shall that bee when not one kinde of paine but the whole viole of god wrath shall bee powred not on one member but on the whole soule bodie and conscience and that not for a time vnder hope of better but eternallie without hope of release and that not in this world where there are comforts helpes and remedies but in that vglie and darksome place of torrments and that not amongst liuing man which might mittigate thy paine or else bemone thee and bewaile it with thee but with the diuells amp daned spirits which will now laugh at thy destruction and solace themselues in this thy miserie and will reioyce as thou diddest serue them in earth so now in hell to bee thy tormenters it may bee therefore by the way a good warning and wisedome to vs all when wee feele the extremitie of some bodilie paine to consider with our selues and say oh then what shall bee my miserie and torment if i repent not when not one member but soule bodie and conscience shall bee racked and tormented in the feeling and apprehension of the anger of the lorde of hostes in these three points stands that curse and wrath of god vnder which euerie man is borne and these doe answere to the three degrees of sinne which are in vs for as the two first rules taught vs there is in euery man by nature till hee repent a threefolde guiltinesse first a guiltinesse of adams sinne secondly the taint of originall amp vniuersall corruption thirdly a pollution by manie outragious actuall sinnes in the first of these euerie man is equallie guiltie in the second euerie man is equallie corrupt but in the third euerie one keepes that compasse within which the lorde will keepe them by his limiting power now as in our guiltinesse of adams sinne sinne hath his beginning in original sinne his continuance in actuall sinne his perfect on so answerable herevnto the wrath of god which alwayes standeth opposite to sinne is begunne in leauing vs by nature to the slauerie of sathan is continued by death and is accomplished in damnation and nowe these three rules i commend to the carefull and christian consideration of you all certifying you from god that as you can neuer bee saued vnlesse you repent nor repent vnlesse you searche your selues as heere the prophet biddeth so that you can neuer search your selues aright till you be perswaded and resolued of these three rules amp of the truth of them all euen in your hearts and consciences namely first that thou article guiltie of adams sinne secodly that thou article prone by nature to all evil in the world thirdly that for these thou article subiect to the wrath of god and to all the curses of his wrath but when thou article in heart amp conscience resolued that these are true then thou article a fit scholler for this lesson of the prophet search thy selfe for when thou goest thus prepared vnto this search and esteemest of thy selfe as the three rules haue described thee then if thou search into thy selfe thou wilt finde thy selfe and thy estate to bee such as will cause thee to repent returne and take a newe course therefore what the prophet saide to those iewes i say vnto you also my brother of this realme of england who are now heere gathered together out of so manie countryes and quarters of this realme yes in the name of the same god i cry vnto you search o search your selues and thinke it not a matter indifferent to doe or not to doe it but knowe it that god commands you as euer you wil come to saluation search your selues and the rather because by these three rules you see howe much chaffe of corruption is in your nature and what neede therefore it hath to be searched into and fanned by repentance bee well assured thou man whatsoeuer thou article there is so much chaffe in thee that if thou search not and fanne it not out thou wilt prooue nothing but chaffe at the last day and so be blowne away with the winde of god iustice into hell take holde therfore of this exhortation and deferre it not thou wilt not suffer thy wheate to lye too long in the chaffe for feare of hurting it is it then safe to suffer the chaffe of thy sinnes and corruptions to lye cankering and rotting in thy heart be sure that that little portion of grace which thou attainest vnto by liuing in the church and vnder the ministery of the word of god will bee putryfied and cleane corrupted with the chaffe of thy sinnes therefore againe and againe i exhorte you to make conscience of this dutie search into your selues fanne out this chaffe this presumption of ours and high esteeming of our owne nature and conceites of god fauour before we haue it that so this chaffe beeing blowne away the lord may then bestowe vpon vs soundnesse of grace and the foundation of all goodnesse which is a holy and humbled heart saluation is such a building as the foundation thereof had neede to bee sure and strong ignorance blindenesse and presumption are not sufficient foundations for such a building therefore as no man wil build a strong house vpon anie earth but hee will first search it least it prooue sandie and so ouerthrowe all so a wise christian will not build his saluation vpon fancies and conceits and naturall presumptions but will search and looke into his heart and finding these to be sandie and rotten and therefore too weake for the foundation of so glorious a building will refuse them all and labour to furnish his heart with such sounde grace as wherevpon hee may trust so weightie a worke as is the saluation of his soule againe if thou wilt stande in the day of triall then search thy heart betime and discerne between chaffe and wheate thou seest that chaffe flyeth away before the winde but good corne indures the fanne and the furie of the winde so in the day of triall temptation sickenesse or open persecution the chaffe of naturall presumption and outward formalitie in religion will flye away and it must be the penitent humbled and beleeuing heart which must then abide it out and endure the fan of temptations and persecutions and to conclude let not the diuell deceiue thee in making thee imagine or hope to please god and yet to let thy corruptions lie vnseene and thy sinnes vnsearched out least thereby thou marre all for thou vsest not to laye vp wheate in thy garners vntill it be purged from the chaffe so thinke not to store vp anie sauing knoweledge or anie other grace of god in thy heart vntill the chaffe of vanitie bee first blowne away that so the holie graces of god may be laid vp in the garners of thy soule and therefore questionlesse to speake one worde to touche our common professors in the verie sore of their soules all knowledge that is stored vp in these vnpure and vnsearched hearts is euen as wheate layd vp in the chaffe which is a thousand to one sure to bee eaten vp by the chaffe so that when the winnowing time of triall and persecution comes i feare that such man will for all their knowledge shrinke aside and betraye the trueth their knowledge then prouing no better then chaffe because it was layde vp in an vnholie heart if therefore thou wouldest stande and endure when popery or persecution or temptations come if thou wouldest abide the furie of the fanne of temptations nowe then exercise thy heart with the fanne of god lawe search and ransacke it purge out the chaffe of corruption and store vp knowledge in an holie heart and a good conscience and that will abide the violence of all temptations yes when god suffers the diuell to doe with vs as hee did with peter to winnowe vs like wheate to sifte and trie vs as he did iob with the furious winde of all his malice then knowledge will prooue wheate that will abide the winde and gold that will abide the fire thus glorious will it bee in the ende if wee followe this holie prophets counsell and search our hearts now wee come to the second generall point here laid downe that is whom must wee search the prophet answereth your selues not other man but your selues this search so vrged and inforced by the prophet must not bee of other mens hearts amp liues but of our owne our owne are our charge and not other mens and therein is the saying true which else is most false euery man for himselfe for as euerie soule must bee saued by it selfe so must it beleeue repent and search it selfe the dutie therefore here commaunded is for euerie man that woulde haue his soule to be saued to search it and reforme it amp leaue others to be searched by themselues here the holy ghost meets with the common corruption of this world and that is that man are eagle eyed to see into the liues of other man but to looke into their owne heartes and liues they are blinder then moles they can see moates in other mens liues but discerne not beames in their owne whereby it comes to passe that they stumble and fall fowlie for the eyes of most man are set vpon others and not vppon themselues and therevpon it is that an euill man seeing oother man and not himselfe thinkes best of himselfe and worst of other man but contrariwise a good man seeing himselfe and not other man thinkes worst of himselfe and better of other man an euill man lookes outward and iudgeth other man but a good man lookes homeward and iudgeth himselfe and in iudging condemnes himselfe farre aboue other man and that because by searching into his owne heart and waies he knowes that by himselfe which he knowes not by any man in the world besides so then wee must search not other me but our selues our owne hearts amp our owne liues are our charge and burthen the liues of other man concerne vs not being priuate man further then either to follow them being good or take heede of them being euill but to search or be inquisitiue into them is no dutie commaunded vs but rather a foule and a base vice forbidden of god indeede magistrates in their people pastours in their congregations and housholders in their families are to search but they can search onely for criminall causes to open actuall sinnes but this searching must be of our hearts which no man can search but our selues onely fewe man haue a calling to enquire into other mens liues but euery man hath a calling to search into himselfe but alas man doe farre otherwise they suffer themselues to rotte in their owne sinnes and erect an inquisition ouer other mens liues and it is to be seene in daily experience that those man who are the great searchers and pryers into other man are the neglecters and forgetters of themselues and contrariwise they who doe narrowly search themselues and their owne wayes and looke into the corners of their owne hearts doe finde so much worke to doe with themselues that they little busie themselues wi h other man it followeth o nation not worthy to be beloued the third point who must search the iewes who are here termed a nation not worthy to be beloued and yet for all that they are bid to search themselues that so vpon their repentance they might be beloued where we may see the vnspeakable loue of god and his wonderfull mercy offer grace vnto such man as are altogether vnworthy of it god children are by nature like other man and god findes nothing in them why to respect them aboue other but euen of his owne mercy makes them worthy who of themselues are not therefore how worthy is that god to haue all the loue of our harts who loued vs when we were not worthy to be beloued but let vs examine more particularly why god doth call the iewes a nation not worthy to be beloued i answere god had blessed them aboue other nation hee gaue them his couenant of grace amp thereby made them his people and committed to their trust his holy word and oracles but he delt not so with other nation neither had the heathen knowledge of his lawes besides all this they hadde a better land then others about them it flowed with milke and honie that is with all commodity and delights and though their country was but little yet themselues so populous and so powerfull that whilest they pleased god no enemie durst set vpon then thus for soule and body they were euery way a nation blessed of god a people beloued of god aboue all others now how did this people thus beloued of their god requite this his loue which they had no more deserued then any other nation certainely as they deserued it not afore they had it so they requited it not when they had it but requited this loue of god with sinne with rebellion and with disobedience they tempted him they prouoked him to wrath they presumed of his mercy and proued a most stubborne amp stifnecked people a froward generation moses partly saw this in his owne experience and better discerned it in the spirite of prophesie and therefore wondring at this their wickednes he cried out do you thus requite the lord o foolish people and vnwise thus that is with sin and disobedience which is the onely meanes to displease the lord amp to prouoke him to wrath for this cause they are worthily called a foolish and vnkind people by moses and here by the prophet a nation not worthy to be beloued namely for their vnthankefulnesse and vnkindnes which was such as they not onely were slacke and carelesse in performance of such duties as god required but eue multiplyed their sinnes and committed those soule rebellions which his soule hated and amongst many the prophet here in this chapter noteth three of their great sinnes for which they were a nation not worthy to be beloued couetousnesse crueltie and deceit all which were the more hainous and intollerable because they were the sinnes of their princes their rulers and their priests who should haue bin lights amp examples to the rest now although euery sinne in it selfe is of that ill desert as it is able to cast vs out of god fauour and depriue vs of his loue yet behold here god complaines not vppon a little cause but for wonderfull and exceeding vnthankfulnes amp vnkindnes in them who of all other should haue loued the lord as a man cares not for hard vsage from him whom he esteemes not but a little vnkindnesse dooth greatly greeue a man from him who is loued and respected so is it with the lord our god hee loued not the gentiles as hee did the iewes neither was hee so bountifull vnto them and therefore as wee may see though they liued alwayes in ignorance and continued alwaies in disobedience yet the text saith the time of that ignorance god regarded not but when as the iewes his owne people whom hee chose out of all people and bestowed his loue vpon them and made his couenant of grace with them when they became vnkind vnthankfull forgetfull stubborne and rebellious that caused the lord euen to complaine of that indignitie and to cry out by moses doe ye thus requite the lord o foolish people and vnwise and heereby the prophet o nation not worthy to be beloued and therefore there is no man but if he be asked what hee thinkes of this nation of the iewes he will aunswere that they are a most vile and wicked people a froward generation and that they are worthy to taste deepely of all god plagues who so farre abused his loue and mercy but what doth this belong to them alone and is israel a nation not worthy to bee beloued nay i may cry out with as good cause o england a nation not worthy to be beloued for god hath beene as good a god to vs as he was to them and wee haue beene as vnkind a people to him as they were to him but that i may be free from discrediting our natio amp fro defiling my owne nest let vs prooue both these points and laye them open to the viewe of the world first therefore the same mercies and farre greater haue beene powred and heaped vpon vs hee hath called vs out of the dareknes first of heathenisme and then of popery his couenant of grace and saluation he hath confirmed with vs his treasures of his word and sacraments hee hath imparted to vs his holy word neuer better preached and the mysteries thereof neuer more plainly opened since the time of the apostles and as wee haue religion so wee haue it vnder a religious prince whereby it comes to passe that these blessings of saluation we enioy not in secret or by stealth but we haue it coutenanced by authority so that religion is not barely allowed but euen as it were euen thrust vpon man besides all this wee haue a land also that floweth with milke and hony it is plentifull in all good things wee haue liberty amp peace vnder a peaceable prince and the companions of peace prosperitie plenty health wealth corne wooll golde siluer aboundance of all things that may please the heart of man thus hath god deserued the loue of england but now england how hast thou requited this kindnesse of the lord certainely euen with a great measure of vnkindnesse that is with more and greater sinnes then euer israel did so that if moses spake true of them then may our moses much more truly cry out against england doest thou thus requite the lord thou foolish people and if this prophet said thus of israel for three sinnes then may it be saide of england for three hundred sinnes o england a nation not worthy to bee beloued for thou hast multiplied thy transgressions aboue theirs of israel euen as though thou hadst resolued with thy self the more god kindnes is heaped on thee the more to multiply thy sinnes against him for thou england as thou hast requited the lord with sins so not with a fewe sinnes or smal sinnes or sinnes which hardly could haue bene preuented for that had beene a matter of some excuse or not of so great complaint but thy sins are many and grieuous and capitall and which is worst of all wilfull and affected euen as though god had deserued euill of vs and that therefore wee ought malitiously to requite him if any man make doubt of this and therefore thinke i speake too hardly of our church i will the deale plainly and particularly and rip vp the sores of our nation that so they may be healed to the bottome the common sinnes of england wherewith the lord is requited are these first ignorance of god will and worship i speake not of that compelled ignorance in many corners of our land which is to bee pittied because they want the means but wilfull and affected ignorance man are ignorant euen because they will be ignorant meanes of knowledge were neuer so plentiful and yet neuer more grosse ignorance is not he wilfully blind who will not open his eyes in the light amp can there bee any darknesse at noone day but it must bee wilfull but our nation is darke and blinde in the sun shine of the gospell and grosly ignorant when the gospell beats their eares and light shines round about them so as if they closed not their eyes and stopped not their eares they coulde not but both heare and see who woulde look for ignorance after thirty fiue yeares preaching and yet many are as ignorant as if they had beene borne and brought vp vnder popery so that our people are as euill as those in the dayes of christ of whome the holy ghost saith light is come into the world but man loue darknesse more then light so knowledge is come into england but many english man loue darknesse better then knowledge alas how many thousands haue we in our church who know no more in religion then they heare in common talke of all man and which is worse they thinke it sufficiet also amp which is worst of all wheras they might haue more they will not but care not for it the second maine sin of england is contempt of christian religion religion hath bin among vs these fiue and thyrtie yeares but the more it is published the more it is contemned and reproched of many insomuch as there is not the simplest fellow in a country towne who although he knows not one point of religion yet hee can mock and scorne such as are more religious then himselfe is this is one of the moaths of england that eates vp religion this is grieuous in whomsoeuer but most intollerable in two sortes of man first in them who are altogether ignorant that they should mocke they knowe not what a pittifull thing to here one who himselfe cannot giue the meaning of one petition in the lord prayer to vpbraide other man because they are too forward but it is the worst of all when man of knowledge and such as liue ciuilly and would be counted good christians are indeed of the better sort cannot abide to see others goe a little before them but if they doe presently they are hypocrites and dissemblers thus not prophanenesse nor wickednes but euen religion it selfe is a by word a mocking stocke and matter of reproach so that in england at this day the man or woman that begins to professe religion and to serue god must resolue with himselfe to sustaine mockes and iniuries euen as though hee liued among the enemy of religion and not among professours and as religion increaseth and spreadeth it selfe so doth the number of these mockers o what a cursed sinne is this to contemne the greatest fauour that god can giue vs that is his holy religion for the which we should rather praise him all the daies of our liues all that god can giue a man in this world is his gospell what then can god giue to bee regarded whe his gospell is cotemned this sinne was neuer amongst the iewes they indeede regarded it not so as it deserued but who did euer make a mocke and a scorne of it but england o england how canst thou answere this god sendes thee the most precious iewell that he can sende to a nation and thou scornest it amp them that bring it and them that receiue it euen as though it were no blessing but a curse so that as christ saith to the iewes for which of my good workes doe you stone me so may the lord say to england i haue giuen thee a fruitfull land a blessed prince golde and siluer peace and liberty plentie and prosperitie for which of these o england doest thou contemne my religion the least of these deserue loue but england hath a better then all these that is his gospell the word of saluation and yet that all is contemned as beeing nothing worth and those which confesse it and those that bring it and consequently god himselfe that giue it if england had no more sinnes but this this deserues that it should be saide of vs that wee are a nation not worthy to be beloued aboue all nation for some nation woulde haue religion that they might loue it but they cannot haue it some haue it and loue it not but in no nation is it made a mocking stocke but in england and where are those man but in england who like the dog in the manger will neyther entertaine religion themselues nor suffer them that would let vs in time take heede of this sinne as a sinne that crieth to god to reuenge so vile a dishonour done to his maiestie neyther is there any sinne that more certainely foreshowes and more forcibly hastens the remoouing of the gospell from vs for high time is it to cease louing where loue procures disdaine and to stay giuing where gifts are scorned carrie home this lesson to your great townes and cities where you dwell for in these populous places are these great mockers for where god hath his professours the diuell hath his mockers and repent betimes of this sinne for holde on in mocking and bee sure that god who will not bee mocked will remooue his gospel from you but if you leaue this sinne and entertaine the gospell as it worthilie deserueth then be sure of it that god wil continue the gospel to you and your posterity after you in the face of all your enemy round about you the thirde common sinne of england is blasphemie manie wayes but especiallie in vaine swearing false swearing and for swearing and the abuse of all the names and titles of the lorde god this sinne is generall euen ouer the whole land especiallie in fayres and markets where man for a little gaine will not care to call the lord of hostes to be witnesse to a lye and the god of truth to testifie an vntruth and which is worst of all god holie name is vsed in vaine oathes and ordinarie talke when man haue no cause to sweare at all so that it is most lamentable to see and obserue that the name of any man of honour or worship is vsed more reuerently amp lesse abused then that fearfull and glorious name the lord our god the fourth generall and great sinne is prophanation of the sabbaoth a common sinne euerie where and yet so great a sinne that where it raignes in that countrey congregation family man or woman there is no feare of god nor anie true grace in them for the keeping of the sabbaoth is the maintaining increasing and publishing of religion the fifth sinne of our nation is euill dealing in bargaining betwixte man and man how hard a thing is it to finde an honest simple plaine dealing man and that euen in such great assemblies as this is i feare present experience will testifie you are nowe manie thousandes gathered together some to buy some to sell some to exchaunge remember that i haue tolde you an honest hearted and plaine dealing man is harde to finde therefore labour to approoue your selues sincere hearted man remember the counsell of the holie ghost let no man oppresse nor defraude his brother in bargaining for the lorde is the auenger of all such thinges these sinnes are generall and vniuersall as a canker and so are the sinnes of the sixe seuen amp eight commaundements though they bee not altogether so common as these bee murthers adulteries vsuries briberies extorsions cosonages they are a but then vnder which our earth grones and they crie against vs to heauen so that vpon as good or much better cause may it be saide to vs as to the iewes o nation not worthy to be beloued looke at the outward face of our church at the signes of god loue which are amongst vs and at god dealing with vs and behold we are a beautifull church a glorious nation a nation to be admired and wondred at but looke at the liues of our ordinary professours looke at our sinnes and at our requiting of god loue and wee are a people of sodome as full of iniquities as they were whose sinnes were so manie so rise and so ripe that at the last they will euen bring downe fire and brimstone or some other strange iudgemet vpon vs if repentance do not preuent it or the cryes and prayers of holy man stay not god hand so then let vs all here assembled grant amp confesse that wee are a nation so farre from beeing worthie to bee beloued as that wee are most worthie to be hated and to haue all the wrath of god powred vpon vs now then are wee so and shall wee continue so still nay that is the worst and most wretched of all then let euery one of vs learne this dutie enter into our selues search our hearts and liues that they may lie open to our owne sight to the confusion of vs in our selues that in god by repentance wee may be raised vp our sinnes lye open before the face of god and stinke in his presence and crie for vengeance and before the face of god angels who bewaile it amp before the face of the diuell who reioyceth in our confusions and shall they lye hidde onely to our selues now then if wee would haue them hidden from god and stoppe the cry that they make against vs and keepe them from sathan who accuseth vs for them we must so search our selues that they may lye open vnto our owne heartes remember thou thy sinnes and god will forget them laye them open before thine owne face and god will hyde them from his write them vp for thy owne selfe and god will blot them out of his remembrance but if contrarywise thou hidest them then assure thy selfe the more thou hydest amp buriest them the more open doe they lye in the face of god and then what will followe but that they will all bee disclosed at the last day to thine eternall confusion therfore againe and againe i exhorte you in the name of god search your selues finde out your sinnes confesse them to god freely and ingeniouslie confesse their deserts to be hell and damnation humble your heartes to god crye and call for pardon as for life and death purpose and promise to leaue them begin a newe course of life beleeue stedfastlie and doubt not but of pardon and forgiuenesse in the blood of christ continue in that faith and that newe course of life so may englande preuent god iudgements amp quench that great action of vnkindenes which god hath against them and become a nation as worthie vpon their faith and repentance in christ to be beloued as for their peace and prosperitie they haue beene of all nation of the earth admired the fourth generall point in this exhortation is time limitted them when they should search before the decree come forth ampc as though the prophet should say israel repent before god execute his iudgementes on thee for beholde the gratious dealing of god man sinneth his sinnes deserue plagues but god presently plagueth not but deferres it hee puts a time betwixte the sinne and the punishment ordinarily this hee doeth to shewe his mercie vnto mankinde because that he would not destroy them if they would amende therefore after the sinne he smites not presently but puts off his punishment that in the mean time man may repent here the prophet compares the lorde to a mother for as she conceiues the fruite in her wombe and beares it a long time ere shee bring it out so the lord after a mans sinnes or a peoples sinn s conceiue that is ordaines and decreeth a iudgement for it but hee keepes it vp and all that while hee beares it but as shee when her time is come then trauailes and bringes foorth so when the time that god hath appointed is come and still sinne not repented of then his iustice trauailes to bee deliuered of that iudgement which mercie hath kept vp so long a time thus the olde worlde had an hundred and twentie yeares giuen them for time of repentance all that while god was in conceiuing at last when their sinnes were ripe and no hope of amendment then god trauelled and brought forth a fearefull byrth namely the vniuersall flood to wash away and take reuenge vpon the vniuersall iniquities of those times so mame hundreth yeares hee gaue vnto the iewes long hee was in conceiuing their destruction and oftentimes he had it at the bringing foorth as in the captiuity of babylon and vnder antioch yet his mercie stayed it and still hee trauailed longer telles them heere by the prophet that yet the decree is not come foorth though it bee conceyued but at last when israel woulde not repent but grewe worse and worse as in christ his time then hee could containe no longer but trauelled indeed and though it be with griefe yet hee hath brought forth and what a most fearefull birth euen an vtter desolation of that kingdome and countrey of their cittie and temple and a dispersion of this nation ouer all the world but as a woman at last is deliuered with daunger and difficultie with paine and sorrowe so the lord long conceiues but at last brings forth his iudgements yet is it with griefe and vnwillingnes and hee is loath as it were and much grieued to execute his most iuste iudgementes on those who haue professed his name hee often touched the iewes a little and as beeing vnwilling to smite them hee drewe backe his hand againe but at last when their sinnes did so increase amp were so strong that they euen did wring out by violence his plagues from him then with much bewailing of their great miserie as wee may see in christ weeping for them hee executes his iudgementes on them but as they are long a comming so when they come foorth they were the heauier as a childe the more fulnesse of time it hath is the greater the liuelier and the stronger so god iudgements the longer god deferreth them amp is in conceiuing them the heauier are they when they come that is manifest in the iewes once his owne people for hee hath destroyed their land with an irrecouerable destruction amp smitten their posteritie with a blindnesse of minde till this houre so that to this daye when the olde testament is read the vaile is ouer their eyes that they cannot see the light of christ iesus but plod on in fearefull and palpable blindenesse this doctrine hath speciall vse to this our church to teache vs to looke to our selues betimes and trye our owne woyes and turne to the lord for we cannot tell how farre off his iudgements are in reason they must needes bee neare they haue beene so long deferred and yet beene so iustlie deserued of vs certainely god hath long beene in conceyuing iudgementes and plagues for the sinnes of england and often hath god hande beene vpon vs by war famine pestilence in vndations and yet it hath beene puld backe againe and his sword hath beene put vp into his sheathe and god hath stayed his byrth euen in the verie trauell and wee haue escaped euen as a man whose necke hath beene vpon the blocke and the axe holden vppe to strike so then yet the day is not come yet wee haue time happie wee that euer wee sawe this daye if nowe wee haue grace to repent and searche our heartes for then wee shall stay his iudgement decreed that it shall neuer come forth against vs but if wee deferre to repent put off from day to day and lie rotting still in our sinnes then knowe and bee assured that as the decree is established so it must needes come foorth and the stroke stricken repentance is too late therefore what hee said to the iewes i say vnto vs search thy selfe o england a nation not worthie to bee beloued before the decree come foorth which is alreadie past against thee now followeth the last point the reason of all why should wee searche our selues the reason is included in the fourth point for there is a decree come forth against thee and although the execution be defeated and though god bee vnwilling to take it out yet without repentance it is most certaine it shall come forth and be executed at the last in one word this is the reason repent or else certainely god will take vengeance but will mans heart say is this true or rather these bee but wordes to feare man and to keepe them in awe i answere for proofe and experience hereof neuer goe further this place and present example wee haue in hand the prophet bids them search search and repent else as certainely as there was a iudgement conceiued so certainely it should be executed vpon them they would not heare nor search nor repent but what followed let all man iudge whether god is not true of his worde to them or no yes alas who seeth not that god hath trauelled indeede and hath brought foorth a fearefull iudgement on them and hath made them for these thousand yeares and a halfe the gazing stocke the byword and the amazement of all the world thus was it threatened to the iewes and thu is performed and certainely thus hath it beene threatned and thus shall it bee performed to thee oh england except thou preuent the iudgements that are comming oh happie england that i may say vnto thee it is yet but comming for as for the miserable iewes vppon them alas it is come alreadie vnto those poore soules it can bee saide no more repent before the decree come foorth for it is nowe past but thou article happie for thy day is not yet come yet i may say vnto thee repent before the decree come foorth and oh happie england that thou mavest heare this worde before sounding in thine eares therefore my beloued brother who are heere assembled out almost of euerie corner of this kingdome heare my wordes and carrie them home with you into all countryes god is the same god still as iust amp as iealous as euer he was our sinnes are as ill nay much viler then the iewes were howe can it bee then but that must fall to vs that fell to them therefore the zeale of god glorie and my desire of your saluations make me that i dare not flat but tell you the truth that is that out of all question if wee search not our selues and repent there is a generall iudgement in preparing for vs certainly the decree is out and what can stop the execution of it but repentance god hath long spared and he hath bene long in trauelling therfore though nothing can bee saide in way of prophesie i am in my conscience perswaded to feare amp that out of infallible grounds of the word of god that a plague and a iudgement and that moste fearefull hangs ouer england and that it is alreadie pronounced vppon this nation and shall bee as certainely executed without a visible reformation and because i may seeme to speake somewhat large giue mee leaue to giue you the reasons inducing me herevnto first the gospell hath bene preached these fiue and thirty yeares amp is daily more and more so that the light therefore neuer shone more gloriouslie since the primitiue church yet for all this there is a generall ignorance generall of all people generall of all points yes as thogh there were no preaching at all yes when popery was newely bannished there was more knowledge in manie then is nowe in the bodie of our nation and the more it is preached the more ignorat are many the more blind and the more hardened euen as a stithie the more it is beaten vppon the harder it is so they the more they heare the gospell the lesse esteeme they it and the more they contemne it and the more god calles the deaffer they are and the more they are commaunded the more they disobey we preachers may crie till our lunges flye out or bee spent within vs and man are mooued no more then stones oh alas what is this or what can this bee but a fearefull signe of destruction will anie man endure alwayes to bee mocked then howe long hath god beene mocked will anie man endure to stande knocking continuallie if then god hath stoode knocking at our heartes fiue and thirtie yeares it is nowe time to be gone vnlesse we open presently but if wee will knowe what this argueth to contemne the gospell and not to repent when the word is so abundantly preached reade the storie of elie his wicked sonnes he spake vnto them and gaue them godlie counsaile but they hearkened not vnto the voyce of their father but will some say that is no great matter not to heare their father a common thing but marke what followeth they would not heare their father because the lorde woulde destroy them a fearefull thing euen so it is with a nation or a people are they taught and are they worse and worse take heede if elyes sonnes obey not it is because god will destroy them if therefore elie and many elyes haue spoken to england and england heares not england obeyeth not england repents not take heede the the lord in heauen say not england will not heare the voice of the prophets because i will destroy it let no ma say we take vpon vs to prophesie we onely giue warning and shew the danger by example of the like my second reason is this one iudgement executed and not working repentance is alwaies a fore runner of an other that rule is certaine and an euident truth amp needs no prouing now wee haue beene visited with famines earth quakes pestilences invndations thunder and lightnings in winter and most straunge and vnseasonable weather but alas all these haue taken no effect where is the humiliation repentance and reformation which they haue wrought therefore it must needes bee there remains behind a greater iudgement man may be so madde to thinke these to be ordinarie things and to come by course of nature and ordinarie causes but certainly they are the shaking of the rod and fore runners of a great iudgement vnlesse repentance cutte off their course for look as one cloud followeth another till the sun consume them so one iudgement hastens after an other and repentance onely is the sun which must dispell them thirdly it stands with the iustice of god according as he hath reuealed it in the scripture especially in deut out of the whole chapter it must needes bee gathered as a rule i will curse that people that breake my lawes nowe wee may not deny but this land of ours is for abundance of sinne a people of sodome all kinde of sinnes in all estates of man rage amp raigne euery day more and more therefore i conclude that vnlesse we repent and so dissolue this cloud of iudgemet that hangs ouer our heades it cannot be but a most fearefull tempest is to come at the last and when it is come it will be too late to wish they had done it therefore in the bowels of christ iesvs let this bee to intreate and exhort you all to search and looke into your selues that so repenting and changing your wayes you may get the sword againe into his sheath which is alreadie drawne out but yet hath not stricken home and may quench the wrath which is alreadie kindled but yet burnes not out as it will doe if by repentance we quench it not and doe this euery one as you tender the saluation of your owne soules and the continuance of the gospell to this glorious nation and the peace and prosperous state of this church and common wealth for let me make what causes they will it is certainely sinfulnesse that ouerturnes kingdomes and changeth states as all these kingdomes and states haue felt who haue continued finally to contemne the gospell it followeth and you be as chaffe that passeth on a day the prophet proceedeth and describeth more plainly the manner and state of that plague which god will sende vpon them the meaning was partly opened before to bee in effect thus much search your selues least god take his fanne and try you because you woulde not trye your selues and finding you vppon the tryall not sound wheate but light chaffe blowe you to hell with the winde of his wrath the metaphor which the prophet vseth is this he compares the lord to a husbandman great and rich the whole world is his corne fielde seuerall nation as this of ours for one are his heapes of corne but the heapes of corne bee full of chaffe that is these particular churches are full of hypocrites nowe a wise husbandman letteth corne and chaffe lye together no longer then till the wind doth blowe and then he appoints his fanning time to seuer his corne from his chaffe and to blow away his chaffe and lay vp his corne so god the great and wise husbandman will not let the chaffe lye for euer amongst the wheat he hath therefore appointed his faning times whe to blow the chaff into hel amp to gather his wheat into heauenly garners nowe god winnowing times are two the one is at the last day after this life and that is god great winnowing day of all his corne that of all man when the bad shall be seuered fro the good for euer neuer to be mingled againe with them but by the strong amp powerfull fan of his last and finall iudgement to be blown into hell the winde of whose wrath at that day shal be stroger to blow them all away then all the wind in the world to blowe away one handfull of light chaffe god other fanning time is in this world and that is also double the one is when the word is preached the preaching of the word is one of god fannes for when the gospell is preached to a nation or congregation it fannes them and tries them and purgeth them and so serues them that a man may see a manifest difference of the chaffe and the wheat that is of the goodly man and the wicked man this preaching of the gospell doth john the baptist expresly call a fanne where the holy ghost pursueth this whole metaphor most plainely speaking of christ he saith whose fanne is in his hand and he will throughly purge his floore and gather his wheate into his garner but the chaffe hee will burne with fire vnquenchable the winde of this fanne of the word preached is so strong as that it seuers the chaffe from the wheate that is good professors from hypocrites in the visible church and blowes so strongly vpon the wicked that it brings them to the beginning of hell euen in this world for it so worketh vpon the conscience as if it cannot conuert them it strikes them with feare terrour and torment either in life or at death which torment of conscience is the very flashes of hellfire but when this first fanne of the word will not serue to bring man to repentance for the word preached doth not confound a man actually but onely pronounce the sentence and thereby striue strike the consciece then god hath another fanne and that is the fanne of his iudgements and that fanning or winnowing time is when he executes his vengeance and his iudgements on a nation this is his latter fanne when the first will not preuaile this is his powerfull and strong fan driuen about with the winde of his wrath this fanne went ouer the olde worlde and swept them all away and went ouer the nation of the iewes and wee see they are no more these three fannes of god make a threefold separation of the chaffe from the wheate that is of the wicked from the elect with the fanne of his worde which is powerfull hee seuers them in all affection and disposition and makes a distinction of them so as generally the wheat is knowne to be wheat and chaffe discerned to bee chaffe by the preaching of the word but though the tare be knowne to be tare yet both grow together so that the word onely serues them in affection and sets seuerall notes of distinction vpon them both but then the second fan of his iudgements is more violent for thereby he seuereth them asunder in soule gathering the godly man as his wheate into the heauens and blowing the soules of the wicked into hell but yet the body of them both lye together as partakers of the same iudgement so subiect to the same corruption and are all lodged in the same graue of the earth and death hath like dominion ouer them all but afterwards at the last day at god great haruest and great winnowing time he then with the winde of his power seuereth them asunder in soule and body wheat from the chaffe sheepe from the goates and separateth them neuer to be mingled againe for euer and euer and then with the winde of his wrath hee blowes the chaffe into fire vnquenchable and with his louing fauour gathereth his wheate into the euerlasting and glorious garners of heauen so then the first seuereth them in affectio the second in soule for a time the third actually in soule and body for euer and euer nowe of these three winnowing times the holy ghost speaketh here properly of the second namely the fanne of god iudgements so that the meaning of the metaphor is this search your selues and repent betimes lest god come vppon you with some fearefull iudgements because you haue so long contemned the fanne of the word and finding you too light to abide the triall doe take you away in the iudgement and cast you into hell for as sure as the fanne of the word hath made differece of you which are chaffe and which are wheate so sure shall the fanne of his iudgements blow away the chaffe to hell and damnation now for the vse for vs in england the case stands thus our church doubtlesse is god corne field and wee are the corne heape of god and those brownists and sectaries are blinde and besotted who cannot see that the church of england is a godly heape of god corne but withall we must confesse we are full of chaffe that is of prophane and wicked hypocrites whose hearts and mindes abound in sinnes and rebellions and many of our best professours are also too full of chaffe that is of corruptions and do giue themselues too much libertie in many sinnes but alas the pure wheate how thinne is it scattered how hard to find a man at least a family which dedicate themselues to the lord in holy and sincere obedience and labour to make conscience of all sinnes now therefore seeing wee are god corne field and wee haue some pure wheate amongst much chaffe therefore god will winnow vs to find out the corne if he haue but one corne of wheate in a handfull of chaffe but one good man of many hee will stirre all the heape for those few corners hee will not care to blow all the chaffe to hell to finde out those fewe cornes of wheate to lay them vp in heauen so that out of all question england being so full of chaffe must looke to be winnowed now for the first fanne of his word it hath beene vsed in this land these fiue and thirtie yeares and that as powerfully and as plentifully as any where in the world and yet alas many are more godlesse more ignorant more prophane then euer they were yes wickednesse groweth and the chaffe increaseth aboue the wheate be sure therefore that god will bring his second fanne vpon vs because we will not suffer the first and milde and gentle fan of his word to try and search vs therefore wee will bring the fearefull fanne of his iudgements and with it hee will blowe soule and body into hell with those our sinnes and corruptions which we would not suffer the fanne of god word to blow from vs the first hath so long blowne in vaine that the second must needes come vnto vs and it hath already begun to blow three or foure blastes haue blowne ouer vs famine pestilence earth quakes fire water winde these haue so blowne some of vs that they haue taken away a great number of vs for vs that remaine this onely remaines that wee strengthen our selues by grace to bee able to stand against the next blast for come it will and when it comes no wealth nor worldly thing can inable vs to endure it onely faith and repentance and the grace of god will stand at that day now therefore in that so fearefull a fanning abideth vs seeing it is so neere as appeareth by the blastes already past ouer vs which are nothing but the forerunners of a greater tempest what should be our care except wee care not to be blowne body and soule into hell but to labour to eschew this fearefull fanne of god wrath or at least if it come vpon vs that it may not blow vs to hell but hasten vs to heauen if thy heart be touched to aske how this may be i answer thee only to follow the prophets aduice in this place by searching and trying our selues the way to escape god triall is to try thy selfe amp to escape god iugdement to be a iudge to thine owne soule and so the way to escape the fearefull fanne of god is to fanne their owne heart by the law of god for whomsoeuer the first fanne that is the worde of god doth worke vpon these man are neuer blowne away with the fan of god iudgements o then entertaine the word of god into thy heart submit thy soule vnto it let it pierce and try amp ransacke thy heart and lay before thee thy wretched estate by thy sinnes and when thou seest thy nakednesse and misery confesse it bewaile it and be humbled for it cry and call for mercy and forgiuenes pray against thy speciall sinnes striue to purge them out as the poyson of thy soule craue grace from god for all thy sinnes if thou seest any sinnes more welcome to thy nature more deere vnto thee and which more preuaile against thee then others doe pray against these sinnes and striue against them aboue all amp endeaour that by the fanne of god word they may be blowne away from thee when thou hast done this marke what will come of it when thou hast fanned thy selfe god will not fanne thee but when the fanne of his iudgement comes amp bloweth so strongly vpon the wicked then the lorde finding thee alreadie fanned and clensed by his word will spare thee and his iudgement shall either blow ouer thee and passe by thee vntouched as ouer lot in the destruction of sodome or else shall fanne out all thy corruptions and blowe thee vp to heauen to be laide vp as pure wheate in the heauenly garners and mansions of glorie which christ ascribed to prepare for thee now then amongst those many businesses with which this world doth cumber euerie of vs all which shall perish with the world it selfe let vs good brother spare sometime for this great businesse martha may be combred about many things but this is that one thing which is necessarie therefore whatsoeuer is done let not this be vndone once a day put thy selfe and thy life vnder the fanne of god lawe try thy selfe what thou article and thy life how thou liuest once a day keepe a court in thy conscience call thy thoughts thy wordes and thy deedes to their triall let the ten commaundements passe vppon them and thy sinnes and corruptions which thou findest to be chaffe blow them away by repentance so shalt thou remain pure and cleane wheate fit for the house and church of god in this world and for his kingdome in heauen but if wee will not doe this then alas what will follow my heart greeueth to vtter it but i must vnlesse i should bee a false prophet and therefore i will our long peace plenty and ease haue bred great sinnes so great that they reach to heauen and prouoke god maiestie to his face amp so strong that they will violently draw downe iudgemets from god vpon vs which when they come they will bee so powerfull and so violent that they will blowe vs away like chaffe and bring this kingdome to some miserable ruine o therefore how happy are wee if we can entertaine this doctrine amp practise it for in so doing wee shall preuent god iudgements we shall continue the gospell to this land and preserue this glorious nation from being destroyed or dispeopled by some fearefull iudgement beloued you come hither to this place purposely to buy and sell and thereby to better your estates in this world how happy then are you if besides the good markets you make for your body and estates you learne also how to make your selues abide the triall of god iudgements and how to be made pure corne fit to replenish the garners of heauen and howe to continue god fauour and the gospell to this nation if thou goe away with this lesson thou hast a iewell more worth then thou shouldest goe home possessed of all the huge riches of this faire you call this and such like times faire times but if thou learne this lesson right then thou maiest say that this was the fairest day in deede that euer shone vpon thee since thou wast borne this pretious iewell which i haue spoken of al this while i here offer vnto thee euery one bringes hither something to be solde this is the marchandise that i bring and set to sale vnto you what euer commoditie any of you bring it is from some quarter of this land but all is from the earth but this that i bring it is from heauen and all the earth cannot yeelde it and as it is from heauen so it is of a heauenly vertue and will worke that which all the wealth in this faire is not able to doe therefore cast not to buy the basest and let passe the best of all and neuer alledge that it is aboue thy compasse and being a iewell it is too deere and costly for thee for i offer it freely vnto you and to euery one of you i pronounce vnto you from the lord that here this blessed doctrine is offered vnto you all in his name freely and that you may buy it without money happy is that day when thou comming so farre to buy things for thy body and payes so deare for them doest meete with so precious a iewell the vertue whereof is to saue thy soule and payest nothing for it thou mayest hereafter reioyce and say i went to buy and sell and to helpe my body but i haue also learned to saue my soule i went thither to helpe to mainiaine my owne estate but i haue learned to helpe to maintaine england in prosperitie for assuredly if wee would all of vs learne this lesson and practise it wee might assure our selues of the glorious prosperitie of england to continue from generation to generation whereas alas if wee continue and goe forward in our sinnes and impenitencie it is greatly to be feared that neyther the gospell nor this peace will reach to our posteritie therefore now to make an end i once againe and lastly commend this doctrine to you all and euery one of you for this marchandise that i bring is of that nature that though some take it yet there is also inough for euery one and i commend it vnto you euen from the very mouth of god himselfe thinke of it i charge thee as euer thou lookest to appeare before the face of christ iesus the great iudge at the last day and if thou wouldest escape the rigour of that iudgement enter now into iudgement with thy selfe amp search thy selfe if thou now wilt not receiue this doctrine then shal it at the last day be a bill of enditement against thee for if it saue thee not it shal condemne thee think of it therfore seriously as a matter that concerns thy soule amp body yes and thy posterity and this whole realme all which shall smart for it if we repent not and if the body of our people and those whose hearts are wedded to this world will not entertaine this doctrine the i turne vnto you that feare the lord and to you i direct my last warning search o search and try your hearts amp liues renew amp reuiue your faith amp repentance that if iudgements doe come and blow vpon this nation and driue the gospell from it and it to hell that yet you may haue a testimonie to your consciences that you did not pull downe this generall calamitie but for your parts laboured to haue preuented it by your earnest prayers and hartie repentance that so the posteritie ensuing may not curse you but speake reuerently of you and praise god for you and wish that all had done as you did for then had they enioyed this goodly lande and all god blessings with it as we their forefathers did before them and so shall our names not rotte but flourish amongst the posterities to come which shall be partakers of the desolation and when we haue renewed our repentance let vs then euery one of vs deale with the lord by earnest prayer for this church and nation that the lord would shew his mercy vpon it and continue vnto it this peace and the gospell it is nothing with the lord to doe it his powerfull hand is not shortened he can continue our peace when the papists looke for hurli burlies hee can continue the gospell when they hope to set vp their idolatry againe let vs therefore applye the lord with our prayers and with moses set our selues in the breach and pray for the ignorance of the multitude and bewaile their sinnes who bewaile not their owne so did noah daniel and iob in their ages and praied for the people in generall calamities let vs all bee noahs daniels and iobs in our generations if wee doe thus then when iudgements come we shall either turne them away from our nation or at the least wee shall deliuer our owne soules let vs now turne to the lord in prayer and because it cannot be hoped but that this our generall sinfulnesse must needes ende with some heauie iudgement let vs desire the lord still to defet our deserued punishments and still to spare vs and to giue vs time and leysure to repent that so wee entring into our selues and searching our hearts and turning to the lord wee may turne away his imminent iudgements and that when his wrath doth burne out indeede we may then be counted worthy in christ to escape those things which must needs come vpon the world amen

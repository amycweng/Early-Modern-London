theology is the science of living blessedly for ever blessed life ariseth from the knowledge of god and of our selves the parts of the theologie are that there is a god is evident the names of god are the nature of god is his most lively and most perfect essence the perfection of the nature of god is that where by he is wholely compleat in him self exod act the perfection of god nature is the simpleness and infinitnes thereof the simpleness of god nature is that whereby he is void of all logical relation in arguments that is god hath not in himself either subject or adjunct john and in god to be and to be just and mighty are all one but in the minde of man it is not all one to be and to be mighty or just for the minde may be destitute of these virtue and yet a minde the nature of god is immutable and spiritual god immutability of nature is that by which he is void of all composition division and change james malach god nature is spiritual in that it is incorporal and therefore invisible john colos tim so much for the simpleness of god nature the infinitness of god nature is either his eternity or his exceeding greatness god eternity is that by which he is without beginning and ending ps reverand his exceeding greatness is that by which his incomprehensible nature is every where present both within and without the world ps king jeremiah by this it doth plainly appear that god is one and indivisible and not many as ephesian corinthian that god is the knower of the heart for nothing is hidden from that nature which is within all things amp without all things which is included in nothing nor excluded from any thing as king psalm the life of god is that by which the devine in nature is in perpetual action living and moving with it self psalm heb these three following attributes do manifest the operation of the divine nature towards the creatures the wisdom and knowledge of god is that by which god doth by one eternal and immutable act of understanding distinctly and perfectly know himself and all other things though infinite whether they have been or not matth heb psalm god wisdom is his foreknowledge and his counsel god foreknowledge is that by which he most assuredly foreseeth things that are to come act rom god counsel is that by which he doth most rightly perceive the best reason of all things that are done prov so much of the wisdom of god the will of god is that by which he doth most freely and justly will all things with one act rom epb james in god there are two wills a will whereby god determineth what shall be done concerning us or in us a will whereby god determineth what shall be done off us the first of these wills is called predestination and therefore it is that predestination is commonly defined to be the preparation of the blessing of god whereby they are delivered which are delivered the second of these wills is the gospel predestination determines who who and how many are to be saved and hereupon christ saith i know whom i have choosed john the gospel which is the second will of god determines what kinde of ones they are that shall be saved and how they must be qualified predestination which is the first will of god is god decree it self the gospel which is the second will of god is an outward means of the execution of this decree of predestination in the will of god there are three actions i e v lendo velle an action whereby god doth absolutely will any thing and delight in it an action whereby he doth wholely and absolutely nill a thing a remiss action which is as a mean between the two former actions as when a thing is remissely or in part both willed and nilled god willeth good by approving it god willeth evil because it is good that there should be evil for this cause god doth voluntarily permit evil but as it is absolutely evil he wills it not but doth dissalowe and forsake it act psalm the will of god in respect of diverse objects is called diversly by diverse names as by the names of love hatred or of grace justice the love of god is that whereby he approveth first himself and then all his creatures as they are good without their desert and doth take delight in them john joh rom his hatred is that whereby he disliketh and detesteth his creature offending for his fault corinthian psalm and god grace is that whereby he freely declareth his favour to his creatures rom tit the grace of god is his goodness or his mercie god goodness is that by which he being also absolutely good doth freely exercise his liberality upon his creatures matthew amp god mercie is that whereby he freely assisteth all his creatures in their miseries esai lament exod god justice is that by which he in all things willeth that which is just as psalm and god justice is either in word or deed god justice in word is that truth by which he constantly and indeed willeth that which he sayeth or hath said rom matth this is the justice of god in keeping his promise tim john god justice indeed is that by which he disposeth or rewardeth god disposing justice is that by which he as a free lord ordereth all things rightly in his actions psalm his rewarding justice is that by which he rendereth to his creature according to his work thes pet jeremiah again the justice of god is either his gentlenes or his anger god gentlenes is that whereby he freely rewardeth the righteousness of his creature thes matth god anger is that by which he willeth the punishment of the creature offending rom john so much concerning the will of god god omnipotency is that whereby he is most able to perform every work matth god power is either absolute or actual god absolute power is that by which he can do more than he either doth or will do matth philipp god actual power is that by which he causeth all things to be which he freely willeth ps god glorie and majesty is the infinite excellencie of his most simple and most holy divine nature heb nehem in which we may see that god can onely know him self perfectly john tim exo the manifestation of god glorie is either obscure as here on earth or apparent as in heaven the obscure manifestation of god glorie is the vision of god majesty in this life by the eys of the minde through the help of things perceived by the outward senses as isai exod corinthian the apparent manifestation of god is the contemplation of him in heaven face to face this concerning his glorie god blessedness is that by which god is in himself and off himself all sufficient genes collos tim the persons of the god head are they which subsisting in one god head are distinguisht by incommunicable properties john genes john the persons are coequal and distinguisht not by degree but by order there is a trinity of persons but a unity in essence for the three persons are but one infinite essence the communion of the persons or rather the union of the persons is that by which one of them is in the rest and with the rest by reason of the unity of the god head and therefore every each one doth possess love and glorifie another and work the same thing john and and prov the persons of the god head are three matth the father is a person without beginning from all eternity begetting the son john in the generation of the son we must note these properties that he that begetteth and he that is begotten are together and not one before another in time he that begetteth doth communicate with him that is begotten not some one part of his essence but his whole essence so that this communion is not a communion but a union the father begot the son not out of himself but in himself the incommunicable property of the father is to be unbegotten to be a father and to beget the father is the beginning of actions and beginneth every action of himself and effecteth every action by the son and by the holy spirit corinthian rom the son is the second person begotten of the father from all eternity john joh the son in regard of his essence is of and by himself very god but in regard of his filiation and sonship as he is a person and the son of the father he is not of himself but from another for he is the eternal son of his father and thus is he truely said to be very god of very god for this cause he is said to be sent from the father john and this sending taketh not away the equality of essence and power but declareth the order of the persons john philipp the property of the son is to be begotten his proper manner of working is to execute actions from the father by the holy ghost john corinthian the holy ghost is the third person proceeding from the father and the son john rom job the incommunicable property of the holy ghost is to proceed the holy ghosts proper manner of working is to finish an action effecting it as from the father and the son the works of god are all the world and all the things contained therein the end for which all things are created is the manifestation of the glorie of god rom the decree of god is that by which god hath freely from all eternity determined all things ephesians matth rom the execution of god decree is that by which all things in their time are accomplisht according as he foreknew them and decreed them the decree of god is the first and principal working cause of all things and it is also in order and time before all other causes this first and principal cause doth not take away freedom of will in election nor the nature and property of second causes but it bringeth them into a certain order and it directeth them to their determinate ends and hereupon the effects or events of things are either contingent or necessary even as the nature of the second cause is and thus christ according to his fathers decree died necessarily as act but yet willingly john and if we respect the temperature of christs body he might have prolonged his life and therefore in this regard he may be said to have died contingently god foreknowledge is conjoyned with his decree and in regard of us it is before his decree but not in regard of god the branches of the execution of god decree are his operation and his operative permission his operation is his effectual producing of all good things which either have being or moving or which are done god operative permission is that whereby he onely permitteth one and the same work to be done of others as it is evil but as it is good he doth effectually work it gen amp isai god permitteth evil by a certain voluntary permission in that he forsaketh the second cause in working evil and he doth also forsake his creature either by detracting the grace it had or by not bestowing that which it wanteth rom tim and in this we must not think god unjust for he is indebted to none rom it is in god pleasure to bestow how much grace and upon whom he will matth that evil which god permitteth in respect of god is good whither it be as a punishment or as a chastisement because he can and doth produce good out of it god decree as it concerneth man is called predestination predestination is a decree of god by which all man are ordained to an everlasting estate either of salvation or condemnation thess the means of accomplishing god predestination was the creation and the fall the creation is the world and the inhabitant in the world the parts of the world are the heaven and the earth the heavens are three fold the air sky the invisible heaven heaven in a large acceptation is all that is above the earth all which is distinguisht into three heavens the first heaven is the space between the earth and starry firmament the second heaven containeth the sun moon amp stars the third heaven is the invisible heaven this is the place in which the blessed do behold the majesty and glorie of the almighty the inhabitant of the world are angels man and all other creatures in angels there are these things to be considered their nature they are spiritual and incorporeal essences heb and their qualities sam first they are wise secondly they are of great might thes sam kings another quality of them is thirdly that they are swift and of great agility isa daniel their number they are innumerable daniel hebr the place in which these good angels are and that is in the highest heaven for there they do ever attend upon god and have society with him matth mark psalm their orders or degrees which what they be no man can certainly say but there are arch angels spoken of in scripture thes and angels matth and cherubims amp seraphims esai but it concerneth us not to search this neither may we curiously enquire after it there office which is to magnify god and perform his commandments psalm the angels were created within the six days as appeareth gen the knowledge that the angels have is either natural revealed experimental the ministry of the angels is three fold either to adore or to praise or to glorifie god continually to this purpose do they stand in the presence of god ever more ready to do his commandments as isai luke reverand ps daniel part of the ministry of angels respecteth the church for they are ministring spirits sent forth of god to minister for the good of those that shall be heirs of salvation heb for the good of all these they minister first in this life in the end of this life and in the last judgement in this life they watch for the good of their body and for the good of their soul and that from the beginning of their days to the end of them psalm in the end of this life they carry the soul to heaven as they did the soul of lazarus luke in the last judgement they do gather all the elect together that they may come before christ and so enter into eternal fruition of glorie both in body and soul matth another part of their ministery concerneth god enemy and it is to execute judgements upon his enemy at his command man was made after god image and resembling god in holiness in the excellent state of mans innocence these things are to be considered the place in which he was set in his innocence and that was the garden of eden that pleasant place gen the integrity of mans nature he was created in righteousness and true holiness ephesians there are two parts of mans first integrity wisdom for he had a true and perfect knowledge of god and his will as far as it was to be performed of him and of the counsel of god concerning all creatures genes secondly justice which was a conformity in his will affections and powers of his body to the will of god mans dignity which consisted in these things in mans communion with god god rejoyced in man made in his own image and man did fervently love god and this appeareth by god familiar conference with adam genes secondly in his dominion over all the creatures of the earth gen psalm thirdly in his decency comeliness and dignity of body for though he was naked yet was he cloathed with the best and excellentest roabs even with innocence there was imprinted upon him by god a princely majesty so that there could not then be any thing in him unseemly gen psalm fourthly in his labour of body which was without pain or grief gen mans subjection to god for he was bound to perform obedience to these commandments of god he was not to eat of the two forbidden trees the commandment concerning the trees was as a proof and a trial of mans obedience the tree of life was a sign to man to confirm to him his perpetual abode in the garden of eden if he did continue in his obedience reverand the tree of the knowledge of good and evil was a sign of death to him if he did transgress god commandment gen mans calling which was to obey god commandments and to dress the garden of eden gen and his diet which was the herbs of the earth and the fruit of all the trees save of the tree of life and of the tree of knowledge of good and evil and all the other creatures gen and his free choice to perform or not perform these commandments thus were our first parents created in perfect innocence but mutable and thus it pleased god to prepare a way to the execution of his decree the fall was of man and angels angels fell by leaving that good state wherein god had placed them jude in their fall may be observed their corruption arising from their fall by reason of which they are full of malice and hatred and hatred and by reason of this they do set themselves against god and insatiablely desire to destroy all mankinde and that they may do this as much as in them layeth they do neglect neither force nor fraude to act it withall pet ephesians john their degrees and diversity for one of them which is called baalzebub is chief and prince of the rest of the devil and he is far above the rest in malice matth reverand he is also called the prince of this world and the god of this world corinthian ephesians their punishment god after their fall gave them over to perpetual torments without any hope of pardon jude pet by this we may see what great punishment they deserved and that grievous sins will be grievously punished their punishment was first their dejection from heaven pet and the shortning and limiting of their power job secondly a grievous pain and torment in the deep which is endless and infinite in time and measure luke matth reverand the fall of man was his revolting from his obedience to sin sin was his transgression of god commandment or mans fall was his disobeying of god commandment in eating the forbidden fruit wherein these things are to be considered the manner of mans fall the devil having immediatly before fallen himself perswaded our first parents that both the punishment for eating the forbidden fruit was uncertain and that also god was not true in his word unto them having done this he blinds the eyes of their understanding and they being thus blinded straight began to distrust god and to doubt of god favour and when he had brought them to a doubting he moved them to behold the forbidden fruit which so soon as they saw in its beauty upon his motion of them to this purpose he then stirred them up to desire it and from the desire of it he moved them to satisfie their desires and so the woman pluckt the fruit and did eat and gave it to her husband and he did eat gen to the thus did they willingly fall from their integrity god for just causes suffering it the greatness of their transgression which appeareth by these trespasses that they committed in that action of disobedience they doubted of god word they being bewitched with the devil promises cease to fear god punishment and thus become puffed up with presumption and enflamed with the desire of greater dignity and will no longer believe god threatnings they forsake god word and seek after other wisdom they are proud and seek to magnify themselves and to become like god they contemne god and against their own consciences sin against his commandment they prefered the devil before god they are unthankfull and drive out the holy spirit of god from dwelling in them and thus despised that everlasting blessed union they murthered both themselves and their progeny the fruits and effects of it upon it there arose a state of unbelief and by it we are all included under sin rom sin is threefold a participation of adams transgression and guiltiness by being in his loyns when he offended as heb it is said of levi that he paid tythes in abraham because he was in the loyns of abraham when abraham paid tythes original sin which ariseth out of the former transgression original sin is a corruption engendred in our first conception by which the faculties of soul and body are prone and disposed to evil psalm the remnant of god image which man retained after his fall were certain notions concerning good and evil as that there is a god and that he doth punish sin and that there is an everlasting life and the like all which serve to make man without excuse in the sight of god rom from the fall our mindes receive ignorance by it we were deprived of knowledge in the things of god by it we were made ignorant of his sincere worship and eternal life corinthian rom by it our mindes are disabled to understand spiritual things though they be taught us luke corinthian from the fall our mindes received vanity for we think falsehood truth and truth false hood ephesians by it we have gotten a natural inclination to conceive and devise onely that which is evil genes jeremiah the increase of sin in the understanding is either a reprobate sense as when god withdraws the light of nature john rom or the spirit of slumber as rom or spiritual drunkenness isai or strong illusions as thess the remnant of god image in the conscience is an observing and watchfull power like the eye of a keeper reserved in man partly to reprove and partly to repress the unbridled course of his affections rom from adams fall the conscience hath received impureness titus this impurity worketh these effects it causeth man to excuse sin or cloak it as when a man by his outward service of god doth excuse his inward impiety mark and it excuseth intents not waranted by god word chronicle it doth accuse and terrify us for doing good and this we may see in idolaters and superstitious persons who are grieved when they do omit to perform idolatrous and counterfeit worships to their god column isai effect which it worketh is when the conscience doth accuse and terrify for sin as genes john impureness encreased in the conscience is such a sensless numdness as that it can hardly accuse a man of sin ephesians timoth this senslesness springeth from a custom in sinning sam or else from some grievous horrour and terrour of the conscience as gen the symptomes of this disease are blasphemies trembling of body fearfull dreams act daniel the remnant of god image which remaineth in mans will since the fall is a free choice either in natural actions as to nourish to engender to move to perceive or in humane actions that are common to all man whither they concern manners families or common wealths in all these outward actions man hath free will either to choose or to refuse them though it be but weak as rom by adams fall the will received impotence insomuch as it can not will nor lust after that which is indeed good and which doth please god and is acceptable to him corinthian rom philipp and it received by adams fall an inward rebellion whereby it doth utterly abhor that which is good and will and desire onely that which is evil the will in the first act of conversion to god is not an agent but a patient as it doth appear by this for the affections have by adams fall received a disorder and by reason of this disorder they do eschew good and pursue that which is evil rom kings the body by adams fall hath received a fitness to begin sin for it bringeth in all objects and occasions of sin to the soul genes and the body hath received a fitness to execute sin even so soon as the heart thinketh it rom actual sin ariseth from original sin actual sin is either inward or outward inward actual sin is in the minde will and affections the actual sin of the minde is the evil thought assented to or the evil resolves purposes and intents thereof examples of these actual sins are these as when a man thinks that there is no god ps and or that there is neither providence nor presence of god in this world ps an immagination of safeguard from peril and yet there is a course of sinning ps reverand better esteem of a mans self then ought to be and worse esteem of others than ought to be reverand luke when a man thinketh that the gospel of god kingdom is meer foolishness corinthian and when a man thinketh uncharitablely and malitiously of such as serve god sincerly matth when a man putteth the day of death far off isai when a man thinketh to run on in sin and yet that he can eschew the pains of hell isai when also a man thinketh that though he hold on his sins yet that god will defer both his perticular judgement and the last judgement luke when as god doth open our eys we do see these evil thoughts rebelliously rising in our mindes even as sparckles out of a chimney yet in this will carnal man pretend a good meaning these are the examples of the actual sins of the minde the actual sins of bothwill and affections are all wicked motions inclinations and desires gal outward actual sins are all those in the committing of which the members of the body do joyn with the faculties of the soul to act them such sins as these are infinite psalm outward actual sins are either sins of omission or of commission both which are either in word or deed the degrees of the sin of commission are these james temptation when as the devil offereth to the minde that which is evil to allure a man to sin john act chronicle and this is also effected by occasion of external objects which the senses perceive job tentation hath two parts abstraction inescation abstraction is the first thought of committing sin by it the minde is withdrawn from god service for which it should be always ready prest luke inescation i e to take by a bait inescation is an evil thought conceived and for a time retained in the minde and it being thus kept in the minde it doth by delighting the will and affections lay a bait for a man to draw him to consent the second degree of sin of commission is conception conception of sin is when the heart consents and resolves to commit sin psalm the third degree of it is the birth of sin that is the very acting and committing of sin as when the faculties of the soul and the powers of the body joyn together to act sin the fourth degree of the commission of sin is the perfection of sin that is when sin by custom is made perfect and ripe and then it bringeth forth death and damnation and this is all that the sinner reapeth by his sin an example of this we have in pharo the differences of sins of commission are these to consent with an offendour and not actually to commit sin ephesians this a man doth when he doth in judgement allow the sin of another number when the heart approveth in affection and consent as do ministers and magistrates when they do conceal and winck at offences sam when sin is done indeed by counsel presence or inticement as rom mark act the second difference of sin of commission is sinning ignorantly that is when a man doth not expresly and distinctly know whither that which he doth be a sin or not or if he do know it he doth not acknowledge and mark it tim numb corinthian ps the third difference of sin of commission is when any man sinneth upon knowledge but yet of infirmity as when a man fearing some eminent danger or when a man amazed at the horrour of death doth against his knowledge deny that truth which otherwise he would acknowledge and embrace such was the fall of peter arising from the rashness of his minde mingled with some fear thus do man offend by the strength of the corruptions of their flesh provoking them to that which their heart doth detest rom the fourth difference of it is presumptuous sinning upon knowledge as psalm of this kinde is every sin committed with an high hand or in contempt of god numb secondly presumption of god mercy though we do evil and run on in it ecclesiastes rom the fifth difference of sin of commission is sinning upon knowledge and out of self malice against god of this kinde is the sin against the holy ghost man is punisht for sin first in this life either in body as by care for the provision for his body and by trouble for the things of this life genes secondly by proneness to diseases matth john deut thirdly by shame of nakedness genes fourthly by pains as are in woman in travel and child birth genes in soul as by a trembling of conscience secondly by care thirdly by trouble fourthly by hardness of heart fifthly by madness deut in both body and soul as first by a fearfull subjection to the regiment of sathan colos heb secondly by a seperation from the fellowship of god and a trembling at his presence ephesians gen by diverse calamities and damages in his goods deut by the loss of dignity and lordly authority which he had over all the creatures and by the vanity weakning corrupting and abating of the excellencie virtue and powers of the creatures as rom or in his name by infamy and ignominy before and after his death jeremiah all these things come alike to all yet doubtless it is by reason of sin by adams fall and since that by our improvement of our original and actual corruptions secondly man is punisht for sin at the last gasp first by death or by a change like unto death rom thirdly man is punisht for sin after this life by an eternal separation from the presence of god and from his exceeding excellent glory thes predestination hath two parts election reprobation thes election is the decree of god concerning the salvation of some man to the praise of the glory of his grace ephesians this decree of god is the book of life wherein the names of the elect are written reverand tim the execution of this decree is god effectual working of all those things which he purposed for the salvation of the elect by the same means with which he purposed to do it rom the foundation of this decree is christ jesus heb isai ephesians the means of accomplishing this decree is god covenant and the seal thereof god covenant is either the covenant of works or of grace god covenant of works is the moral law or ten commandments god covenant of grace is his free promise of christ and all his benefits to man if man will repent him of his sins and by faith receive christ the seals of the covenant are the sacraments god covenant of works which is called the moral law decalogue or ten commandments is devided into two tables the first table containeth four commandments the second table containeth six commandments every commandment is both affirmative and negative that is it doth both command and forbid as it is affirmative it bindeth at all times but not to all times as it is negative it bindeth at all times and to all times under one vice expresly forbidden are comprehended all of that kinde yes the least cause occasion or inticement thereto are forbidden john matth thou shalt have no other god before me in this first commandment are these affirmatives first that we must acknowledge god secondly that we must acknowledge no other god but him the marks of the true love of god are these to hear his word willingly to speak often off him to think often off him to do his will without irksomness to give body and all for his cause to desire his presence above all and to bewail his absence to embrace all such things as appertain to him to love and hate that which he loveth and hateth to seek to please him in all things to draw others unto the love of him to esteem highly of such gifts and graces as he bestoweth to stay our selves upon his connsels revealed in his word to call upon his name with affiance the negative part of this commandment is this we must not account that god which is not god in this negative part of this commandment we are forbidden these things ignorance of the true god and of his will atheism which is a denying of god or of his attributes as off his justice wisdom providence presence ps errours concerning god or concerning the persons of the diety or concerning god attributes here helenism or the adoring of a multiplicity of god is forbidden the setting of our hearts and affections upon any thing else but one god the heart is drawn from god by these means by distrusting of god heb from this distrust ariseth first impatience in suffering afflictions jeremiah secondly a tempting of god and this is when the man that distrusteth and contemneth god seeks an experiment of god truth and power matth corinthian a desperation genes a doubting concerning the truth of god or concerning his benefits either present or to come ps by confidence of creatures as when a man putteth trust in the strength of the creatures as jeremiah or in riches matth ephesians or in defenced places jeremiah or in pleasures or dainties and who so trusteth in these doth make his belly his god philipp or in physicians chronicle or in the devil and his works thus magicians trust in the devil and witches and all such as seek help at their hands levit the heart is drawn away from god by loving the creature too much and more than god matth john and by self love tim by hatred and contempt of god as when a man declining from god doth fly from god and is angry with god when he punisheth sin rom and by want of the fear of god ps by fearing the creature more than the creatour by hardness of heart and carnal security as when a man will neither acknowledge god judgements nor his own sins rom luke by pride and presumption as when a man ascribeth that to his own industry and merit which is onely due to god corinthian genes the highest stair of prides ladler is that fearfull presumption of man of climbing rashly into god seat of majesty as if they were god act thes thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above or that is in the earth beneath or that is in the water under the earth thou shalt not bow down thy self to them nor serve them for i the lord thy god am a jealous god visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third amp fourth generation of them that hate me and shewing mercie unto thousands of them that love me and keep my commandments the affirmative part of this commandment is this thou shalt worship god in spirit and in truth john here we are first commanded to use the ordinary means of worshipping god as the calling upon the name of the lord first by humble supplication tim by harty thanksgiving by reading hearing talking and continually meditating on the word of god by the use of the sacraments as act and secondly we are here commanded to use these means holily that is as god in his word hath commanded to use them matth corinthian ecclesiastes ps furtherance of god worship are leagues of amity with those that truely fear god and serve him according to his word chr malaeh and such covenants as the magistrates and people make together with god for the preservation of christian religion chronicle the negative part of this commandment is this thou shalt neither worship false god nor the true god with false worship here we are forbidden these things first to represent god by any image similitude likeness or figure whatsoever deut for all idols are lies habak zach jeremiah secondly we are here forbidden the least approbation of idolatry hosea gen and therefore all processions plays feasts that are consecrated to the memorial and honour of idols exod corinthian thirdly all relicks badges and monuments of idols exod isai fourthly we are here forbidden all society with infidel as marriage with them genes deut malach ezra kings all leagues and confederacy with them in war either to assist them or to receive assistance from them and that for these causes because it doth obscure god glory and maketh him in appearance either unwilling or unable to aid his church because in so doing we shall without doubt infect our selves with their impieties and idolatries because we are thus endangered to be made partakers of their punishments chronicle with idolaters we are also forbidden all traffick in such wares as we know may further the service of their idols we are also forbidden with idolaters all trials in law before judges that are infidel when christian courts are open and may be frequented corinthian but if christian courts be not open we may according to s t pauls rule appeal from one court of infidel to another so from festus he himself appealed to caesar act such necessities as these do make traffick and other things to be frequently used which otherwise are unlawful we are here also forbidden all worshipping of the beast and receiving of his mark revel fifthly we are here forbidden all will worship or worship of god after our own fancies in wayes which are not waranted by the word of god though we do pretend good intention for the doing of it collos sam whither it be by superstitions sacrifices meats apparel observing ceremonies gestures or by our gate conversations pilgrimage or by building of altars pictures or idols and the like or by temples or by strange consorts of musick or by monastic vows of single life or of poverty corinthian cor such vows as these are altogether repugnant to the law of god they are greater then mans nature can perform they do disanull christian liberty and make such things necessary as are indifferent they do renew judaisme they are idolatrous because they make them part of god worship and esteem them meritorious they are hypocrisie for they are but an outward shew of god worship matth the effects of hypocrisie are these first to make a glorious shew of serving god and yet to seek nothing else by it but the pomp and glory of the world secondly to observe and take notice of other mens faults and behaviour and not to see or minde our own thirdly to be more zealous and curious in the observation of the ancient traditions then of the statutes and commandments of almighty god fourthly to strain at a gnat and swallow a camel or to omit serious affairs and the weighty matters of god word and to hunt after trifles matth fifthly to do all things to be seen of man matth and sixthly to fast with an opinion of merit is hypocrisie and to make a distinction of meats for the same the like also is all external abstinence from meats if it be without an internal abstinence from sin and unlawful desires isai we are here forbidden all contempt neglect and intermission of god service revel we are here forbidden all corrupting of god worship and of that order of government which he hath ordained for his church and this we do when we either add to god worship or diminish it or mangle it deut we are here forbidden all religious reverence of the creature revel acts we are forbidden all worship of devil under which is comprehended all kindes of magick magick is a mischievous article accomplishing wonders by the assistance of the devil the devil effects wonders and merveils not by making a new thing which was not at all before but by moving transporting and applying natural things diversly by making a thin body thick and foggy and by bewitching and holding of mens senses the foundation of magick is a covenant with sathan and this covenant is such a contract as doth make man mutually to have to do with the devil the original of this mutual contract is this first sathan or the devil makes choice of such man to be his servant as are by nature either notorious bad persons or else very seemingly silly or indeed silly soul then doth he offer to them diverse means either by magicians or by their writings or by teaching and instruction from himself the means which the devil offers for this purpose are such as are used for the producing of such an effect as by their own nature they were never ordained for nor is there any word of god for the doing of them but against it these satanical means are obscure words and words of scripture wrested and abused holy water sieves seals glasses images bowings of the knee and such like diverse gestures the use of which according to his own will and to his own purpose he teacheth sometimes by secret whispers or suggestions and sometimes either by the words or writings of magicians and when they have embraced these means and do declare their satanical confidence by their earnest endeavour to use and practise this kinde of wickedness by these means the devil standeth ready to assist them and he alone it is that doth by these means which are void of all such vertue as is supposed effect that which his wicked instrument intended then having brought them on thus far the devil counterfeits god and makes as though he was god and as god hath his word and sacraments and faith so likewise the devil hath his characters gestures amp sacrifices which are as it were his sacraments by which he doth signifie to his devilish magicians his own devilish pleasure and by the use of the same they do testifie their obedience to him and as god is delighted with his servant calling upon him so likewise the devil is delighted with the magical ceremonies of his servant and with their invocations the covenant with the devil is either secret or express the secret covenant with the devil is when the party doth not expresly compact and covenant with the devil but yet in heart doth allow of his means and doth assuredly believe that by the using of such means wonders may be effected express covenant with the devil is when the party doth not onely trust in him but also covenant with him and give himsel holely to him upon condition that he may by the observing of certain ceremonies accomplish his desires magick is either

children and man of ripe years are offt enfected poysend hurt bounden killed and otherwise molested by charms the devil doth also offt cure diseases as by mumbling up some few words by making certain characters and figures by framing of circles by hanging amulets about the necks and other parts of the body a thing too frequently used now adays for the curing of diseases which physicians call a curing of diseases by occult and specifick qualities of remedies by the abuse of herbs and medicines to this purpose to such as these it is that solomon speaketh in ecclesiastes saying surely the serpent will bite without enchantment those that do consult with magicians do also worship the devil for they do revolt from god to the devil howsoever they do plaster up their impiety with untempered morter as that they seek god help though by the means of magicians sam levit isai thou shalt not take the name of the lord thy god in vain for the lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name

affairs and that with all reverence deut rom thirdly to celebrate the praise of god which we see brightly shining in his creatures jeremiah to this part of this commandment an oath doth belong the parts of which are these confirmation of a truth invocation of god alone as a witness of the truth and a revenger of a ly a confession that god is a revenger of perjury when he is brought in as a false witness a binding over unto punishment if in it deceit be used the form of an oath is this we must swear truly least we forswear justly least we swear to that which is wicked in judgement least we swear rashly or for a trifle jeremiah isa there are some persons whose oaths binde them not as the oaths of those that swear in their drink and the oaths of frantick furious man fools and children binde them not the end of an oath is to confirm some necessary truth in question as heb rom corinthian an oath is either publick or private a publick oath is when a magistrate without any peril to him that sweareth doth upon just cause desire a testimony under the reverence of an oath a private oath is that which two or more in serious affairs take privatly as did jacob and laban and as did boaz and ruth an asseveration is like an oath but is no oath an asseveration is nothing else but an earnest assertion of our meaning the name of a creature being sometimes used in it an asseveration without the use of the name of the creature is this of christ verily verily i say unto you john an asseveration with the use of the name of the creature is this of david indeed as the lord liveth and as thy soul liveth sam though it be unlawful to swear by creatures yet thus far may we use them in an oath as to make them pledges and as it were cognisances of god glory an oath that a man makes of a lawful thing must be performed though with great difficulty psalm or it might be redeemed as numb the oath of maids under the jurisdiction of parents might by the father of the maid be disallowed in the day that he heard it and so likewise the oath of a married woman by her husband in the day that he heareth it number if a man swear to perform things unlawful either out of ignorance errour infirmity or any other way his oath is to be recalled for we must not add sin to sin sam here we are commanded to sanctify god creatures as meats drink works callings marriage bed by the reverent use of the holy name of god as by calling upon his name for a blessing on them or returning thanks to his name for the benefit of them the means of the sanctification of creatures are two the word of god prayer tim the word teacheth us how to use the creatures to the glorie of god ps prayer is a petition by which we do obtain of god majesty assistance by his grace to make an holy use of his creatures and ordinances ephesians prayer is used upon particular occasions as sometimes for a prosperous journey act sometimes for a blessing upon meat or drink john sometimes for good issue of child birth sam

deut sometimes after the loss of outward wealth job for deliverance out of servitude exod sometimes for obtaining of children gen sometimes for victory sam sometimes for good success in domestical

containeth under it either lying unto god or lying or invocation on god name to confirm a ly and contempt of god threatnings we are here forbidden to swear any thing that is false by the name of god

contempt of his majesty levit all cursing of enemy or of our selves in any kinde what ever all use of god name carelesly in our common talk philipp isai here is forbidden the abuse of god creatures whither it be by deriding god workmanship or his manner of working for in all things we must give god his praise and glory corinthian ps here is forbidden the abuse of lots because the disposition of them doth immediatly come from the lord and the proper use of them is to decide great controversies prov and the land of canaan was devided by lots joshua the priests under the law were commanded to choose the scape goat by lot levit the use of lots we may also read of in these places of scripture joshua to the sam acts here is also forbidden superstition that is an opinion conceived of the works of god providence contrary to god word and to the course of nature examples of this superstition are these to think it unlucky to have salt fall toward a man or have a hare cross the way before him or to have the right ear burn or to think it good luck to finde old iron or to have the left ear burn or to have drink spilled upon a man or to pair the nails upon some day of the week or to dream of some certain things or to think that beast may be tamed by verses short prayers or other charms or to think that the repetition of the creed or lord prayer can infuse into herbs or other things a faculty of healing diseases palmestry is a superstitious thing of this kinde such abominations as these are all detested of god and ought also to be detestable in the eyes of god people as appeareth deut here is also forbidden astrology whither in the calculating of nativities or used in prognostications for in these regards astrology is nothing else but the abuse of the heavens and off the stars for the imaginary twelve houses are made o the fained signs of a supposed zodiak in the highest sphear which is commonly called the first moveable and truly because it is thus high therefore can no man certainly know their influence and vertues this article can not arise from experience because the same position of all stars never happen twice and if they did yet there could be no observation made of them because the influencies of the stars are all confusedly mixt both in the air and in the earth even as if all herbs were mingled together in one vessel by this article mens mindes are drawen from the contemplation of god providence when as they shall hear that all things fall out by the motion and position of the stars stars were not ordained to foretell things to come but to distinguish dayes moneths and years genes isai thou article wearied in the multitude of thy counsellours let now the astrologers the star gazers and prognosticatours stand up and save thee from the things which shall come upon thee daniel books of this kinde they were that for zeal of god glory and love to the truth were burned by the faithfull in the days of the apostles such as these were the curious arts those books treated off act all astrological predictions are conversant or busied about such things as do either simplely depend on the will or dispensation of god or about such things as do depend upon mans free will and so are altogether contingent and therefore can neither be foreseen nor foretold and not upon the heavens it is impossible by the bare knowledge of such a cause as is both common to many and far distant from such things as it worketh in precisely and infalliblely to set down particular effects the stars have indeed a great force but such as doth manifest it self onely in the operation which it hath in the four principal qualities of natural things as in heat cold moisture driness the stars can not at all force the will or give the least inclination to it it is beyond the reach of man to define how great the force of the stars is the effects of the sun and of the moon are apparent in the constitution of the four parts of the year but the effects of the planets and of the fixt stars though they be of great force and innumerable are not so manifest unto us and now because a man can know but some stars onely and their operations and not all the stars and all their operations and forces he can not certainly foretell future things or things to come yes though they did depend on the stars for though the position of certain stars do demonstrate such an effect to ensue yet the aspects of such stars as we know not may hinder those effects and produce the contrary for ought we know that part of astrology which concerneth the alteration of the air is for the most part of it false and frivolous and therefore all manner of predictions grounded upon the doctrine of it are nothing else but toys and delusions and that part of astrology which concerneth nativities revolutions progressions directions of nativities elections of times and the finding again of things lost is very wicked yes it is very probable that this article is of the same brood with implicite magick and that for these reasons because the word of god reckoneth astrologers amongst magicians and adjudgeth them both to the same punishment because the precepts of that part of this article which concerneth predictions are rediculous and therefore such things can not be told by them but by a secret suggestion from the devil or instinct of the devil augustine lib cap de civitate dei saith the same for saith he if we weigh well all those things we will not without cause believe that astrologers when they do wonderfully declare many truths work by some secret instinct of evil spirits which desire to fill mens brains with dangerous and erroneous opinions concerning starry destinies and not by any article derived from any inspection and consideration of the horoscope which indeed is none here is also forbidden popish consecration of water and salt to restore the minde to health and to chase away devil here is also forbidden making jests of the scripture isa also all

and all babling talk and bitter words ephesians john and jestings and all scurrility and that for these causes because quips or jests are like the stings of scorpions serpents and locusts for by this means the devil stingeth those that are jested upon girding them with these offences and netleth or tickleth those with pleasure which take delight in the hearing of them and this is his way by which he doth charm and insensibly sting them also even as he doth the other to their trouble because a christians godliness and gravity can not stand or agree with such behaviour and if any object here that salt and tart speeches have been used in scripture as when eliah mockt the priests of baal kings and when isaiah mockt the king of babylon isai yet such must be thus answered that these speeches

such vanity to this purpose was pauls prayer for the thessaloniaus thes ephesians and to fight against the evil affections and lusts of the flesh rom corinthian to the cogitations thoughts or motions of the heart are of three kindes a glancing or suddain thought suggested to the minde by sathan this doth suddenly vanish away and is not received of the minde this is no sin it was in christ himself when as he was tempted by the devil matth a more remaining and abiding thought or motion which doth as it were tickle and mingle the minde with some inward joy a thought or motion which draweth from the will and affection a full assent to sin to covet is to think inwardly and to desire any thing whereby our neighbour may be hindred although there doth ensue no assent of the will to commit that evil there is a concupiscence or coveting which is evil as when any man doth desire that which is anothers with his loss damage and injury and there is a concupiscence or a coveting or a desire which is good as when a man doth desire meat and drink for the body and the desire of the spirit when it lusteth fighteth striveth and strugleth against the flesh gal the negative part of this commandment is this here is forbidden concupiscence it self that is original corruption because it is hurtfull to our neighbour james and all sudden corrupt cogitations of the heart which spring out of the bitter root of concupiscence gal luke and all suggestions of sathan which after the first offer are entertained and received into the closet of the heart and the entertaining of all tickling cogitations and motions of the heart that do thus delight it as to say with prejudice to any i would such a house was mine or such a living or such a thing and all unchaste dreams which do arise from the force of concupiscence or from the strength of any lustfull desires which man doth suffer his heart to be possest withall the use of the law is this in un regenerate man it layeth sin open and makes it known to them rom in unregenerate man it doth encrease sin and that because of the flesh and this is the cause that man do decline from the commandment and encline to that which is forbidden them rom it is to denounce eternal damnation for the least disobedience without offer any hope of pardon this sentence the law doth pronounce against offendours and by it it doth reign and rule over a man partly by threatning him and partly by terrifying him rom gal corinthian the end of the reigning of sin in man is to urge sinners to fly unto christ rom gal the continuance of the power of the law is for ever unless a sinner doth repent the very first act of repentance doth so free a sinner as that immediatly upon it he is no more under the law but under grace as we may see by david sam rom if we mean to have eternal life we must examin the course of our lives by the square of god law we must set the course due unto our sins before our eys and bewail our miseries and have a holy despair of our own powers and renounce our selves and sue unto christ jesus this is the use of the law in unregenerate man and woman the use of the law in regenerate man is to guide them to new obedience in the whole course of their lives and this new obedience is acceptable to god through christ rom psalm the covenant of grace is god free promise of christ and his benefits to every repentant sinner that will receive him by faith hosea ezek to the and to the malach this covenant is called a testament because it is confirmed by the death of the testatour heb this covenant is like a mans last will and testament it is not for the profit of the testatour but for the benefit of the heir we do here receive from god and not promise or offer unto god in substance the old and new testament is the same the old covenant or testament prefigured christ in types amp shaddows who was then to come the new testament declareth christ already come in the flesh and sheweth him apparently in the gospel the gospel is that part of god word which containeth the welcome message of christ and of the benefits that do come to mankinde by him john act the gospel doth manifest that righteousness in christ by which the whole law is fully satisfied and salvation attained rom the gospel is that instrument or conduit pipe by which the holy ghost doth convey faith into the soul corinthian act to the john to the and faith is the hand by which we do apprehend christ and his righteousness john the sacraments are appendants to the word a sacrament is that whereby christ and his saving graces are signified exhibited and sealed to a christian by certain external rites genes rom the parts of a sacrament are the sign and the thing signified the sign is the visible and sensible matter the thing signified is christ the matter or signs of the sacrament have no inherent force or efficacie at all in them to make any that receiveth them holy this is the alone work of the holy spirit which indeed doth ever accompany the signs when at any time they are received by faithfull and believing soul so that the sign doth onely signify grace either already received or to be received and doth not give it the thing signified is christ his graces the action about christ is spiritual and it is either of god or of faith the action of god is the offer and application of christ and his graces to the faithfull the action of faith is the consideration desire apprehension or receiving of christ in the lawful use of the sacrament by a figure called a metonymie one thing is put for another in the sacrament as the sign for the thing signified john corinthian and and the name of the thing signified is given to the sign corinthian matthew exod and the effect of the thing signified is given to the sign as circumcision is a covenant genes act luke tit and that which is proper to the sign is attributed to the thing signified deut john the ends of the sacrament are the covenant of grace is absolutely necessary to salvation for a man must be within the covenant and receive christ the substance thereof or he cannot be saved but a sacrament is not absolutely necessary to salvation for it is onely a stay for faith to lean on whilest that it doth assure to us that which god hath bestowed on us the want of the sacrament condemneth not but the contempt of it doth for in the i e though a man hath never used the sacraments neglect of a sacrament true repentance will obtain pardon of god m p unbelievers receive onely the sign and not the thing signified and therefore it doth not profit them rom onely true believers do receive the sacraments with profit sacraments and sacrifices do thus differ in a sacrament god doth bestow his graces on us in a sacrifice we return thanksgiving faith and obedience unto god the sacraments of the two testaments thus differ the sacraments of the old testament were many but the sacraments of the new testament are but few these pointed at christ to come these shew him to be come they belonged properly to the posterity of abraham these are common to all the church called out of the jews and gentils the sacraments are two baptism and the supper of the lord the fathers had these sacraments the first of the corinthian to the baptism belongeth to all the faithfull even to all the promised seed it belongeth to infants whose parents are believing or which have but one believing parent corinthian rom genes act it belongeth to all even young and old that believe act matth exod baptism signifieth our regeneration by the holy spirit titus and assureth or sealeth to us our engraffing and incorporating into christ gal corinthian the parts of baptism or of washing are three a putting into the water to signifie that all our sins are washt away by the bloud of christ and that his righteousness is imputed to us act corinthian it doth also signify the mortification of sin by the power of christs death rom continuance in the water which signifieth to us the burial of our sins and a continual encrease of mortification in us by the power of christs death and burial rom a coming out of the water which signifieth unto us our regeneration or spiritual vivification or a newness of life or quickning in holiness and justice which we do obtain by the power of christs resurrection rom the once administring of baptism is a sign of the washing away of all sins both past present and to come pet and this may be a good encouragement to all those that through infirmity fall into sin the lord supper is a sacrament by which in the signs of bread and wine is signified the nourishment of our soul through christ by the holy spirit corinthian to the the receiving of the bread and wine signifieth the receiving of christ john the eating of the bread and drink of the wine signifieth the applying of christ to our selves by faith that so we may finde our communion with him dayly increased and perceive our union with him corinthian the whole scope and intention of the lord supper as it was instituted by our lord was for no other end but to be a remembrance of him corinthian luke man must not because of infirmities abstain from the lord supper but they must use it to confirm them and to strengthen them so much for the outward means whereby the decree of god election is executed the degrees of the execution are two the love of god whereby he doth freely love us in christ jesus who in our selves are corrupt john rom the declaration of god love god doth declare his love either in a secret way by his holy spirit as to infants corinthian luke to the jeremiah or to man of ripe years and that more manifestly as rom corinthian as first by an effectual calling in which god separateth a man from the world and doth entertain him into his own family ephesians and for this cause it is that the world do hate the faithfull john in this calling god doth give us to christ ephesians john and isai rom and hence ariseth the admirable union between christ and his members which is the engraffing of a man into him john and ephesians and this union or communion conjunction or engraffing is wrought by the operation of the spirit which is an infinite essence and therefore sufficiently able to conjoyn those things which of themselves are far distant even as the soul of a man joyneth all his members together and doth cause them all to grow and move and live together ephesians pet philipp by this union it is that we are said to be crucified with christ to die with him to be buried with him and to be quickned raised and placed in heaven with him rom ephesians and by this union as we all are said to sin in adam so we may be all said in christ to fulfill the whole law of god the members of christ are either members outwardly and before man which are onely out of charity so called as externally professing the faith or members in the sight of god which are either decreed so to be as being elect from all eternity though not yet born or not yet called john or actually so already and these are first either actual living members as being engraffed through faith by the holy spirit into christ and therefore grow in the power of holiness or actual dying members or decaying members that is such as have not the feeling of the power of the quickning spirit in them though they be truly engraffed into christ of this sort are all those that are yet dead in their sins till such time as they be again quickned and regenerated god doth execute effectual calling by these means by the preaching of the word and by hearing of it ezek isai john by the law god doth shew a man his sin and the punishment thereof rom by the gospel god doth shew salvation through christ to such as do believe and whilest the word is preaching god doth inwardly enlighten the eys of the minde and open the heart and the ears that the word heard may be truely understood john act psalm john isai by mollifying the heart and making it fit to receive his saving grace into it when he offereth it ezek the hammers by which a stony heart is bruised and broken are these the knowledge of the law of god the knowledge of sin original and actual and of the punishment due unto them compunction or a pricking of heart that is a sense or feeling of the wrath of god for sin act an holy desperation of our own power in the obtaining of life luke mark thirdly effectual calling is executed by faith receiving christ and by the operation of the holy spirit in applying him john rom corinthian zach rom ephesians corinthian in the work of faith there are five motions of the heart linked knowledge of the gospel by the illumination of god spirit isai john to this knowledge in those that are truely humbled is joyned a serious meditation of the promises in the gospel which meditation is stirred up by a sensible feeling of their own beggery and after this knowledge there doth arise a general faith in all such as are enlightned whereby they subscribe to the truth of the gospel heb tim and which knowledge so soon as it is full and perfect it is called that is the full assurance of understanding column rom luke thes hope of pardon by which a sinner believeth that his sins are pardonable though he doth not yet feel them certainly pardoned luke hungring and thirsting after grace which is offered to us in christ jesus john and revel matth an approching with boldness to the throne of grace that so we flying from the terrour of the law may take hold on christ and finde favour with god heb this approching of the throne of grace is done by an humble confession of our sins in the presence of god as did david psalm sam luke by a craving earnestly to god for pardon of our sins and by perseverance in fervent prayer for the same purpose luke act rom hosea an especial perswasion imprinted in the heart by the holy ghost by which every faithfull man doth apply all the promises of the gospel to himself matth and gal this perswasion is and ought to be in every one before he have any experience of god mercie matth john heb in natural phylosophy we do first see things true by experience and afterwards assent unto them thus we are perswaded that water is hot because we perceive the heat by putting our hand into it but in the practise of faith we must first stedfastly believe and then the experience and feeling of comfort will follow chr it is therefore very ill done of any that they should doubt of their salvation because they do not always feel the especial motions of god holy spirit in themselves the lowest degree of faith is that is a weak faith or a little faith like to a grain of mustard seed or to smoaking flax which cannot flame nor give out heat but onely smoak matth and isai faith may be then said to be feeble when either the first of the five motions or the last of them is weak and feeble yes though the other three motions do remain strong rom rules to know this kinde of faith by are these a serious desire to believe and endeavour to obtain god favour is the seed of this faith matth reverand psalm an earnest use of means to encrease the least spark of faith that so it may get growth by little and little luke faith is stirred up by earnest prayer and meditation and by making progress and going on in the ways of perfection and in the exercise of godliness the highest degree of faith is called or full assurance by this a man doth find in himself a certain perswasion and assurance that god doth love him amp will together with christ and all his graces give him eternal life rom and sam ps a man doth not come to high degree of faith till after a sense and long experience of god love and favour the second degree of the declaration of god love is justification by this through the obedience of christ true believers are accounted just in the presence of god corinthian cor rom the parts of justification are remission of sins with a freeing from the guilt and punishment of them and that through the satisfaction made to god for them by christ collos pet imputation of christs righteousness by this those that believe have the guilt of their sins covered and are accounted just in the sight of god philipp rom the obedience of christ is called the righteousness of god and of christ of god because it is of god of christ because it is out of us and in the humanity of christ as in a subject to justification is joyned adoption by adoption we do receive power to be actually accounted the son of god by christ ephesians priviledges that come unto us by adoption are these by it we are made heirs apparent to god rom fellow heirs with christ yes kings and priests rom revel by it all our afflictions yes even our wants and offences are turned to trials or fatherly chastisements inflicted upon us for our good rom psalm corinthian sam by it we have dominion over all the creatures yet so as that in this life we have onely right to the thing but after this life we shall have right in the same corinthian heb by it we have the angels ministring spirits for our good heb psalm the faithfull alone have the true use of creatures because their persons are made acceptable unto god in christ and in him they have restitution made them of the right use of creatures which was lost in adam so that they may use them freely and with a good conscience the third degree of the declaration of god love is sanctification by it we are delivered from the tyranny of sin and by little and little renewed in holiness amp righteousness john rom the parts of sanctification are first mortification by this the power of sin is abated and sin is killed in the faithfull rom gal mortification is wrought in us by the power of the holy spirit abolishing sin in us and regenerating or renewing our spirits vivification by this inherent holiness is begun in us and by little and little augmented and inlarged by the power of the holy spirit for first we do receive the first fruits of the spirit and then by degrees we have a continual encrease of them ephesians and gal rom vivification is a benefit that springeth unto us by the resurrection of christ and is wrought in us by the holy spirit philipp it is this that createth holiness in the heart of the adopted ones of god rom job inherent holiness is distinguishd according to the several faculties of the body and soul of man thes the parts of inherent holiness are these an illumination of the minde to know and understand the will of god which illumination is both the holiness of the minde and the renewing of it colos corinthian illumination of the minde is the effects of spiritual understanding and of spiritual wisdom are these to discern between good and evil heb philipp to discern spirits john thes act to meditate upon the words and works of god ps and to know and acknowledge a mans own inward blindness psalm a sanctification of the memory by which it is inabled to receive a good thing offered to the minde and to keep it and remember it as there is need psalm luke sanctification of conscience this is a grace of god by which a mans conscience excuseth him for all sins after they are once pardoned in christ and also of his upright walking in the whole course of his life tim corinthian act and ps john the inward peace of god doth arise from this sanctity of conscience in all godly man yes and the outward alacrity and chearfulness of countenance also philipp prov job sanctification of will by which through the renewing of the affections by the holy spirit a man doth begin to will that which is good and to refuse evil this is such a state as that the will is partly freed from bondage and partly in bondage to sin philipp rom to the sanctification of affections by this in the power of the holy spirit the affections move well and rightly thes rom the chief affections are these hope by this with sighings we look and wait for the accomplishment of redemption rom this hope when it is grown strong and lively hath its that is its full assurance even as faith hath heb pet fear of offending god because of his mercy pet psalm a contempt or a base account of all worldly things in respect of christ jesus philipp a love of god in christ which is as strong as death and as a fire that cannot be quenchd cant an fervent zeal to god glorie rom an anguish of minde for our own sins and also for the sins of others psalm pet an exceeding great joy in the holy ghost rom the sixth part of inherent holiness is sanctity of body by this in the power of the holy spirit the body is made a fit instrument for the soul to accomplish that which is good by it rom repentance doth follow faith and sanctification and yet in such as are converted it doth first manifest it self repentance is when a sinner turneth to the lord act ezek john repentance is then true when as any one by the motion and instinct of the holy ghost doth purpose will desire and endeavour to forsake his sins and to turn unto the lord and to become a new man psalm act the fruits of repentance is christian conversation in which we bring forth fruits worthy amendment of life matth a christian conversation is such a course of life as in which we do follow christs example amp through the power of his spirit dwelling in us perform new obedience to god matth pet and and the parts of new obedience are these the denial of our selves matth the profession of christ the denial of our selves consisteth in christian warfar in the patient bearing of the cross the parts of christian warfar are the preparation to the battel the combat the preparation to the battel consisteth in the use of the compleat armour of god ephesians the pieces or parts of the compleat armour of god are these truth ephesians justice and righteousness ephesians evangelical obedience which is the shoeing of the feet with the shooes of the preparation of the gospel of peace ephesians faith ephesians as the shield whereby we must quench all the fiery darts of the wicked the sword of the spirit which is the word of god ephesians the helmet of salvation ephesians continual and fervent prayer with watching and fasting ephesians pet the combat is a mutual conflict of them that fight spiritually the combatants or warriours are the tempter and the christian souldier ephesians the tempter is the prince of the power of the air that is the devil and his angels which are spiritual wickedness in high places their helpers are the flesh and the world the conflict of all these enemy is temptation by this they do provoke a man to commit such wickedness as is hurtfull to the salvation of his soul pet in the souldier we must consider his resisting and his fall resisting is an action whereby the souldier through grace working inwardly in him doth withstand temptation john pet ephesians psalm the souldier must strengthen and confirm himself with these preservatives when a man is tempted to sin he must not onely abstain from it but also earnestly love and follow after the contrary viz righteousness and holiness pet ephesians james he must never consent to sathans words whether he speak truth mark or accuse falsly john or flat dissemblingly act he must look for one temptation after another and then especially when his enemy seemeth to be at rest with him as though he had made a truce with him for sathan is such an enemy as will never make an end of his malice pet the fall of the souldier is then when he fainteth through infirmity and as being subdued by the power and violence of his enemy gal the remedy for the restoring a man thus fallen must be by instructing him in the spirit of meekness gal here for encouragement every man may remember this for his comfort that in whomsoever there is a willing heart that man shall be accepted for that grace which he hath and is manifested in the willingness of his heart amp not for that which he hath not corinthian he that will live godly in christ must always remember in all these things that the power of god is made perfect through our infirmity corinthian the devil assaults a man about his effectual calling the temptation here is this the devil striveth to blinde a mans minde and to harden his heart least the word of god should work in him to salvation matth to the this temptation must be resisted by giving ear and endeavouring to receive the word that so through the spirit of god it may be grafted in our hearts and spring in us luke heb james preservatives for the resisting of this temptation are these meditate on the power and use of the word ecclesiastes and attend diligently unto it with thy minde acts hunger after it with the longing desires of the heart john labour to be pure in life psalm cast away evil affections james be doers of the word james consent always to the truth of the word preached act with david hide or treasure up the word of god in your hearts that you sin not psalm reverence and tremble at the presence of god in the assembly of the church isai act in the hearing of the word the fall is coldness in hearing or receiving of it or else a falling into errours the remedy here is to restore by the spirit of meekness and that because we our selves are also subject to be tempted and thus doing is to bear one anothers burthens and to fulfill the law of christ gal the second assault is concerning faith the temptation here is this the devil putteth it into the heart of a godly man that he is not elect that he is not justified that he hath no faith and that therefore he will be condemned for his sins matthew to weaken a mans faith the devil will take occasion to tempt him from his adversities dangers losses persecutions and grievous offences thus he dealeth with david psalm and job from the remembrance of sin past job from a feeling of death even already at hand here resistance must be thus made in the power of true faith we must apply christ and all his benefits to our selves thus i assuredly believe that i shall not be condemned that i am elected and justified in christ and i am out of all doubt that all my sins are pardoned isai rom in this temptation the preservative from the fall is stedfastly to look unto and rely upon christ the object of our faith philipp to the john the fall upon this temptation is doubtfulness and distrust of god mercy and of our own elections as in david ps and the remedies to recover this fall are the powerfull operation of the holy spirit in encreasing faith and stirring of it up philipp luke holy meditations as that it is the commandment of god that we should believe in christ john that the promises of the gospel exclude none but those that exclude themselves isai matth john that doubtfulness and despair are most grievous sins that with abraham we must under hope believe against hope rom that the mercies of god and the merits of christs obedience do belong unto all those that believe isai ps john ps that god measureth the obedience due unto him more by the affection and true desire of the heart to obey than by the external act and outward performance of obedience rom and the malach that when one sin is forgiven all the rest also are forgiven for forgiveness being once given without any limit of time is given for ever rom act that grace and faith are not taken away by sins of infirmity but they are hereby declared and made manifest rom corinthian that god works by contrary means and his power is made perfect through weakness the third assault is concerning sanctification here the temptation is a provoking to sin the devil provoketh to sin according as he findeth a mans disposition secondly as occasion offereth it self thus he provoked david to number the people chronicle and judas to betray christ john here the devil to further his temptation will diminish the sin that he would have a man commit and that either by closely objecting to us god mercie or by covering and hiding from us the punishment due to sin helps by which the devil furthereth himself in his temptations are the flesh the flesh lusteth against the spirit by getting evil motions and affections by overwhelming and oppressing good intents and motions gal to the james the world the world helpeth the devil by its pleasure profit honour evil examples by which the devil laboureth to bring man into disobedience and sin ephesian john these temptations may be resisted by desire of the holy spirit for it worketh good motions and affections in the faithfull and it doth drive forth evil motions gal we may strengthen our selves in resisting thus if we count no sin light or small gal rom if we do avoid all occasions of sin thes judge we must accustom our selves to subdue the less sins that so we may the more easily overcome the greater rom we must ever employ our selves in employments good and warrantable by the word of god we must oppose against the rebellion and loosness of our flesh the law the judgements of god the last judgement the glorious presence of god and the like prov gen remedies against unjust anger and against private desire of revenge are these if we do consider that injuries happen unto us by the appointment of the lord for our good as david speaketh of shemei cursing him sam if we consider that god of his goodness forgiveth us more sins than it is possible for us to forgive man if we consider that it is the duty of christian love to forgive others if we consider that they are the redeemed of christ as well as we and that therefore we must not desire to destroy them if we consider that we are in danger of the wrath of god if we suffer our anger to burn against our brother matth if we consider that we do not rightly understand the circumstances of the facts or what the minde or purpose was of those against whom we swell remedies or bridles against wrath are these if we do imitate the lord in mercy who doth bear long with the wicked matth pet if we make a pause or a delay between our anger and the execution of it if we go out of the place where those are with whom we are angry if we endeavour to avoid contention both in word and deed if we will but oft meditate on this that he shall have judgement without mercy that sheweth no mercy and that mercy rejoyceth against judgement james remedies against desires of riches and honour are these if we consider that in famin god doth quicken and revive those that fear him psalm that godliness is great gain tim that we are not to make our abode upon the earth but travelling through the world to heaven and waiting here for the resurrection and inheritance of eternal life that we are here servant of god and that he therefore will provide us conveniencies that ambition and pride blindeth a mans minde and thus maketh his downfall greater an ambitious man feareth to be humbled least he should not be exalted that pride and ambition brought ruin upon mankinde even in paradise that he robs god of his honour that taketh that glory to himself which is onely due to god remedies against the desires of the flesh are these if we consider that none can be christs disciples but those that live in a continual self denial luke that those that are of the spirit ought always to savour the things of the spirit rom that those which walk after the flesh shall die rom that even here for holiness and righteousness we ought to walk as citizens of the kingdom of heaven philipp that our body are the temples of god corinthian that our members are members of christ corinthian that we must not grieve the spirit of god which dwelleth in us corinthian rom ephesians in these temptations by the flesh the fall is any offence through infirmity which a man by these temptations of sathan is overtaken withall gal in these falls sathan will much aggravate and make greater the offence committed than it is and he will also terrifie the offendour with the judgements of god matthew here the remedy is to renew our repentance the beginning of this repentance is godly sorrow or sorrow towards godward corinthian the fruits of this repentance are seven a purpose and endeavour to live according to the rule of god word confession of sins before god and an earnest entreaty of pardon for the offence at his hands ps sam an holy indignation against a mans a self for his offence a fear not so much because of the punishment as least god should be highly displeased with the sin ps a desire to be delivered from sin and to be fully renewed in life a fervent zeal to love god and to embrace amp keep his cammandments a holy revenge which a man must take of himself for the taming amp subduing of his flesh least afterwards he should again fall into the same offence the second part of self denial is the patient bearing of the cross the cross is nothing else but that measure of afflictions which every faithfull man by the will of god passeth under in his travelling through the world to heaven matth colos no man is to seek affliction or to multiply his own troubles but when god layeth affliction upon a man he is to bear it willingly and patiently colos luke patience is thus strengthened by the holy ghost philipp and by holy meditations as that afflictions come not to a faithfull man by chance but through the counsel and providence of god gen sam psalm the afflictions of the godly are inevitable act matthew john tim secondly that though they be grievous yet they are good and profitable in that by them we are humbled for our sins before god and obtain peace and holiness of life corinthian isai hos psalm jeremiah heb and ps john pet corinthian rom afflictions in the godly are signs of their adoption heb it is a praise for the godly to do well and for it to suffer evil patiently at the hands of the wicked pet they are a godly mans high way to heaven james corinthian thirdly that god hath promised favour and mitigation of punishment his presence in them and deliverance from them corinthian philipp sam ps and isai fourthly that in all our troubles and afflictions we do but take part in that which christ our lord hath suffered before us pet corinthian colos fifthly that in all our afflictions we have angels ministring for our defence and comfort ps kings the prophet elisha saw the mountain full of angels for his defence so much for the denial of our selves the second part of new obedience is the profession of christ this profession doth concern either christ himself or us his members the profession of christ which doth directly concern christ from us is either continual or in time of danger our continual profession which doth directly concern christ is the calling upon the name of god this is a duty that is always required of us in the name of him our mediatour corinthian act colos god name is called upon by prayer or thanksgiving philipp prayer hath two parts petition assent petition is an asking things necessary at the hands of god in the name of christ according to the rule of god word john in every petition we must express a sense of our wants and a desire of the grace of god to supply those wants sam daniel ps and by assent we do believe and profess before god our belief that he in his due time will grant us our requests which we have made unto his majesty john matth though the faithfull may discover many infirmities in their prayers yet they have a notable sense of god favour psalm and and and and and especially when they do pray zealously james and when they do pray often to the lord examples of infirmities discovered in prayer zacharias feared when he prayed luke jonah was displeased and angry jonah thanksgiving is a calling upon god name by which we do with joy and gladness of heart praise god for his benefits either received ephesian or promised psalm collos this for the continual profession of christ our profession of christ in time of danger is either in word or in deed profession of christ in word is called christian apology or the confession of christ as rom psalm christian apology or profession of christ in word is when with fear and meekness we are always ready to confess the truth of christian religion as often as need requireth and that in the presence of unbelievers that the name of god may be glorified pet act to the end we are not bound to make this confession of our faith before unbelievers that are past all hope of repentance for holy things must not be given unto dogs matthew profession of christ in time of danger indeed is called martyrdom martyrdom is an undergoing of the punishment of death for the profession of christ in the doctrine of faith and for justice and for the salvation of the brother for justice john baptist was beheaded of herod mark christ laid down his life for us so ought we if need require for the brother john for maintaining the doctrine of faith stephen was stoned act and yet this doth nothing let christians the using of all holy security for the safety of their own lives for as christ hath shewed in the gospel it is lawful for christians in times of persecution if they finde themselves not sufficiently resolved and strengthened by the holy spirit to stand to fly from place to place for the security of their lives matthew john this christ did and advised his disciples to do the like upon such occasions as these paul fled to tarsus act and upon like occasions eliah fled for his life from jezabel kings thus much for the profession of christ which concerneth christ himself the profession of christ which concerneth his members is either edification or alms edification is every particular duty of us towards our brother which may further them in their growing up in christ and unite them more surely to him rom to edification belong these things to give good example matthew pet to exhort heb rom to comfort thes and james to admonish rom thes they do observe a holy manner of admonishing who do ever admonish in the spirit of meekness and so as if they themselves were guilty of the like infirmities and of such faults as they do certainly know by them whom they admonish out of god word gal matthew tim matthew rom levit alms or relief is that whereby the rich out of their abundance ought freely largely and with open hands to supply the wants of the poor and that to the utmost of their ability and sometimes beyond it corinthian acts in the days of the apostles all those that were converted to the faith by the powerfull operation of the holy spirit esteemed no worldly thing they had their own but held all their worldly store treasures and inheritances in common yes they sold their possessions and goods and parted them to all man as every one had need so much for edification amp alms the fourth degree of the declaration of god love is glorification rom glorification is the perfect transforming of the saints into the image of the son of god philipp corinthian psalm glorification is begun in this life and exceedingly enlarged at the day of death and will be fully and throughly perfected at the general resurrection in the last day death of the faithfull is a sleep in christ in this sleep the soul is for a time severed from the body corinthian act the body lieth in the earth and seeth corruption and at length is raised to greater glory than at first it had corinthian the soul is severed from it that being fully sanctified it may immediatly upon its departure from the body be transported to heaven luke reverand remedies against death or the fear of it are these if we consider that it is nothing else but a freeing of the faithfull from the tyranny of the world flesh and devil and a placing of them safe under the shadow of the wings of christ if we consider that death and the grave are sanctified to us through the death of christ if we do consider that christ is gain unto us as well in death as in life philipp if we consider that the pains of death are nothing to the comforts after death that we shall see god in the brightness of his glory and majesty and be received into the company of glorified spirits in heaven that our soul shall be clad with glorie instead of our body corinthian that we are by it free from all the power of the serpent and of the sting of death corinthian heb if we do not so much think of our death as exactly and diligently consider our life for he that liveth well cannot die ill and he that liveth ill doth seldom die well that the angels of god are ready to carry our soul into heaven so soon as they do depart from our body and our soul being by them brought into heaven shall there magnify the name of god and shall there wait for and pray for the consummation of the kingdom of glorie and for the full and perfect felicity of body amp soul reverand and and the estate of the elect at the last judgement the manner of the last day is this immediatly before the coming of christ the powers of heaven shall be shaken the sun and moon shall be darkened the stars shall fall from heaven matth then the elect and faithfull seing this shall lift up their heads and rejoyce but at this sight the reprobate shall fear and tremble luke tim the heavens being on fire shall suddenly pass away with a great noise and the elements shall melt with fervent heat and the earth and the works therein shall be burned up pet at the same time when all these things shall come to pass the sound of the last trumpet shall be heard sounded by the arch angel matthew thes then shall christ the lord come suddenly in the clouds with power and glory and great train of angels matthew thes at the sound of this trumpet all the dead shall rise and those that are found alive shall be changed in the twinckling of an eye which change shall be in stead of death corinthian then shall all the body of the elect and faithfull be glorified and made glorious like the body of christ then their body shall be spiritual immortal glorious and free from all infirmity corinthian they being all thus gathered together before the tribunal seat of christ he will forthwith place the elect at his right hand and the reprobate at his left hand then will he say come ye blessed to the elect and they shall be taken into heaven and he will say go ye cursed to the reprobate and they shall be cast into hell matth thes reverand the state of the elect after the last judgement the last judgement being finishd the elect shall immediatly enjoy an everlasting blessedness in the kingdom of heaven blessedness is that whereby god himself is all in all his elect corinthian this is the reward of the good works of the faithfull their works being accepted of god for the merit of christs righteousness imputed to them rom tim reverand blessedness doth consist in eternal life and perfect glory eternal life is that fellowship with god by which himself is life unto the elect through the lamb christ jesus john john reverand and for in the kingdom of heaven they shall neither need meat drink sleep air heat cold physick apparel or the light of the sun moon or stars but in the stead of all these they shall have in them god holy spirit by which they shall immediatly most gloriously be quickned for ever revel and corinthian rom perfect glory is that wonderfull excellency of the elect by which they shall be in a far better state than any tongue can utter or any heart can here wish or think this glory consisteth in these things we shall see god face to face we shall ever behold his face which is his glory and his majesty reverand psalm we shall be most like to christ that is we shall be just holy incorruptible glorious honourable beautifull strong mighty nimble john philipp we shall ever inherit the kingdom of heaven for the new heavens and the new earth shall be our inheritance pet matth revel and the fruits of this blessedness are eternall joy the perfect service of god ps the parts of this service are praise thanksgiving reverand and and the manner of performing this service is this we shall immediately worship god by god himself for in heaven there is neither temple ceremony nor sacrament for god and the lamb is the temple thereof and god himself together with the lamb shall supply all reverand and this service shall be dayly for ever and without intermission reverand god in thus saving the elect doth clearly set forth his justice and his mercy his justice appeareth in that he punisheth the sins of the elect in his son own person his mercie appeareth in that he pardoneth their sins for the merits of his son ephesian and these things the lord hath thus decreed and in his good time he will accomplish them to the glorious praise of his name pro the lord hath made all things for himself yes even the wicked for the day of evil the decree of reprobation is that part of predestination by which god according to the most free and just purpose of his will hath determined to reject some to eternal destruction and misery and that for the praise of his justice rom pet jude thes in the scriptures cain and abel ishmael and isaac esau and jacob are propounded to us as types of mankinde partly elected partly rejected the decree of damnation is not here absolutely set down as that we should think that any man is condemned by the meer and alone will of god without any causes inherent in themselves the decree of god is secret it doth arise onely from the good pleasure of god it is unsearchable and adored by the angels it is not known but by that which followeth it namely by the effects therof the beginning and the foundation of the execution of this decree of reprobation is the fall of adam he by his fall made himself and his posterity subject both to sin and damnation rom rom and god so hath decreed to condemn some as that notwithstanding all the fault and desert of condemnation remaineth in themselves for they fall into sin and god hateth them for their sins this hatred which god hath to man cometh by adams fall and it is neither an antecedent nor a cause of god decree but it follows the decree as a consequent reprobates are some of them called by an uneffectual calling and some of them are not called at all in those that are called by an uneffectual calling god decree of reprobation hath three degrees in its execution an acknowledgement of god calling a falling away again condemnation the acknowledgment of god calling is when reprobates do for a time subject themselves to the calling of god which calling is workt by the preaching of the word matth there are of the acknowledgement of god calling five degrees an enlightning of their mindes whereby they are instructed of the holy ghost that they may understand and know the word heb pet the second degree of the acknowledgement of god calling is a certain kinde of penitency by this penitency the reprobate do acknowledge their sins as did the children of israel deut and are pricked with a feeling of god wrath for sin as was cain gen and they are grieved for the punishment of sin as was ahab kings and do confess their sin as did judas matth and do acknowledge god to be just in punishing of sin number and do desire to be saved as baalam numb and do in their misery and afflictions promise repentance saying we will sin no more psalm degree of the acknowledgement of god calling is a temporary faith for a reprobate is content with a general faith he doth confusedly believe the promises made in christ but he doth never apply the promises of god to himself nay he hath no purpose to desire or endeavour to apply the same he hath no wrestling or striving against security carelesness or distrust he believeth that some shall be saved but not particularly that he himself shall be saved james matthew john the fourth degree of the acknowledgement of god calling is a tasting of heavenly gifts as of justification of sanctification of the powers and virtue of the world to come this tasting of heavenly gifts is a sense in their hearts by which they do feel and perceive the excellency of god benefits but they do not enjoy the same for they do not feed on these banckets nor are they nourishd by them but they do onely taste of them heb the fifth degree of the acknowledgement of god calling is an outward holiness of life for a time under this is comprehended a zeal in the profession of religion a reverence and fear towards god an amendment of life in many things as it was in herod mark and in simon magus acts degree of the execution of the decree of reprobation in those that are called by an uneffectual calling is a falling away again after calling this cometh to pass after this manner the reprobate is deceived by some sin his heart is hardened by the same sin his heart being hardened becometh wicked and perverse upon this followeth unbelief so that he will not consent unto god word though he heareth it amp knoweth it there doth immediatly upon this unbelief follow an apostasie or a falling away from faith in christ heb tim apostasie is sometimes a sin against the holy ghost the sin against the holy ghost is so called because it is done contrary to the illumination of the holy ghost it is a set and a stubborn obstinate malice done knowingly against god and against christ and that after illumination or enlightning by the holy spirit heb it is a general or totall defection and apostasie from god after enlightning by the holy spirit out of meer stubborness and malice of heart heb and it is hard to know when a man committeth this sin because the root of it which is malice lurketh secretly in the heart and therefore it cannot be easily discerned this sin is not found in all the reprobates because many of them die before they are enlightned by the holy spirit of god those that commit this sin do never repent and therefore can never receive pardon the elect cannot commit this sin therefore those who do feel in themselves a sure testimony of their election need never dispair after apostasie followeth pollution which is the very fulness of all iniquity and it is altogether contrary to sanctification gen he doth not apostatise nor sin against the holy ghost that in time of persecution doth either rashly or for fear deny christ for peter thus for fear did deny christ matth he that doth ignorantly persecute the church as did paul doth not sin this sin tim and as did the jews act and the third degree of the execution of the d cree of reprobation in those that are called by an uneffectual calling is damnation by which they are delivered up to eternal punishment the execution of damnation beginneth in death and is finishd in the last judgement luke the execution of the decree of reprobation in those which are not called is this they have by nature ignorance and vanity of minde ephesians hardness of heart followeth this by which they do become void of all sorrow for their sins ephesian there doth follow this hardness of heart a reprobate sense that is an extinguishing of the natural light of reason or of the judgment of good amp evil and when the heart doth cease to sorrow for sin there doth follow a committing of sin with greediness ephesians upon this followeth pollution which is the fulness of sin and then a just reward is given to all these viz fearfull condemnation ephesians rom the estate and condition of reprobates when they are dead is this their body being dead lie in the earth their soul are tormented in hell luke pet pet and in the last judgement their body and soul being united shall be cast into the most fearfull and terrible fire of hell matth reprobates when they die do become sensless and astonishd like unto a stone as did nabal sam or else they are overwhelmed with a terrible horrour of conscience and with a despairing of their salvation as if they were overturnd and swallowed up as with a gulf of the sea as judas matth their condemnation is this at the sound of the last trumpet they that are alive shall be smitten with horrour and with fear and they shall be changed in a moment and those of them that are dead shall rise again and their body shall then be made immortal and cast into eternal torments matth john thes christ will pass this sentence of go ye cursed upon them and this being by him pronounced against them immediatly everlasting death shall follow the manner of which is this they shall be separated from the glory and presence of god thes they shall be punishd with eternal confusion and with bitter reproaches for all their secret wickedness and sins shall be revealed thes isai their fellowship shall be with the devil and his angels for ever matth their body and soul shall be tormented with horrour and exceeding great anguish through the sense and feeling of god wrath which shall be poured out upon them for ever isai and by reason of their great tortures their punishment is called hell fire a worm weeping and gnashing of teeth and outer darkness reverand matth isai in this which hath been spoken concerning reprobation the justice of god in punishing sin doth appear and from it ariseth god glory which is the end of punishment for this cause also every good christian must in all things propound god glory as the end of all his actions rom corinthian how to discern and judge of our own predestination rules all the elect in god good time are assured and sure of their election in christ to eternal life rom john corinthian cor the elect do come to the knowledge of their election by the effects of their election the effects of election are the testimony of god spirit rom the works of sanctification pet to the if any doubt of this testimony it may be known whether it doth come from the spirit of god or from her own carnal presumption thus by a full perswasion which they shall finde in themselves for the holy ghost will not onely say it but perswade them that they are god children and the flesh can in no wise do this by the manner of this perswasion the holy ghost doth not perswade man that they are elect by reasons drawn from their own works or worthiness but by reasons drawn from the free grace love and favour of god and this perswasion doth exceedingly differ from that which satan useth by the effects of this testimony or perswasion for if this perswasion cometh from the holy ghost it is lively and stirring but if it doth arise from carnal presumption it is a dead and liveless perswasion for all such as are truely perswaded that they are elected and adopted children of god will love god and trust in god and call upon god with their whole heart if the testimony of god spirit be not so powerfull in the elect then they may judge of their election by their sanctification which is an effect of the holy ghost even as we may judge by heat that there is a fire though we see no flame we may know whether we be predestinate or elect or no by these notable effects of sanctification by feeling our wants and by bewailing in the bitterness of our hearts our offending of god by our sins by our continual striving against the flesh by our resisting and hating the godly motions thereof and if with grief we do think them burthenous and troublesom by an earnest and fervent desire of the grace of god and of the merit of christ that thereby we may obtain eternal life by a true esteem of it when we have obtained it even as a most precious jewel philipp by our love to christians to ministers to brother and by our readiness to lay down our lives for them and with them if need so require matth john by our earnest and fervent calling upon god and that with hearty tears in the sensible perceiving of those sins which we commit to his dishonour and therefore may have just cause to think he may be displeased with them by a desire and love to the coming of christ and to the day of judgement that there may be an end of the days of sin john by our flying all occasions of sin and endeavour seriously to come to newness of life by our perseverance in such good actions and endeavours and in such good thoughts as these even to the last gasp of our lives luther saith he that will serve god must believe that which cannot be seen and hope for that which is deferred and love god even then when he sheweth himself an enemy and thus he must remain to the end if so be that the godly finde all these notable effects of the spirit feeble in them and their faith weak and faint yet they must not doubt of their election but they must know that god doth thus try them and therefore they must not be dismayed for a weak faith is sufficient to engraf them into christ he that as yet feeleth none of these effects in his heart must not upon this conclude himself to be reprobate but he must endeavour by the reading of the word of god and by the use of the sacraments and chiefly by fervent and earnest prayer to come to an inward sense of the power of christ drawing him to himself by his spirit and thus to come to an assurance of his redemption by christs death and passion no man can certainly say of himself or of any other that he is reprobate for god doth oftentimes prefer those to be in his kingdom which in the sight of man seem to be most estranged from his favour and above them also which in outward appearance and in the judgement of man are the children of the kingdom thus were the publicanes and harlots preferred before the pharisees by christ matth and many a man is called even at the eleventh hour matth a notable example of this we have in the thief upon the cross luke the uses of this doctrine for instruction be these there is no justification by works nor any works of ours that are meritorious for election is by the grace of god and therefore justification also in the work of salvation grace challengeth all to it self rom tim philipp rom tit ezek rom hence we learn that judicial astrology or the foretelling of what man will be by the casting of their nativities is false for this doth determine such and such man shall be like in life and conversation whom god in his predestination hath made unlike as for example jacob and esau were born of the same parents and almost in the same moment of time and yet they were most unlike in disposition and had diverse events the like we may see in all twins born at the same time hence we learn that god is most wise omnipotent just and mercifull rom ephesians here we are advised to fight against all doubtings amp distrust of our salvation because it doth not depend upon our works but upon god grace luke rom to humble our soul under the mighty hand of god because we are in his hand even as clay in the hand of the potter rom to give all the glorie to god as to whom alone it is due thes to bear crosses or afflictions patiently rom and that because by this means we are conformed to christ and made like unto him philipp to do good works and that because god hath created us in christ jesus unto this purpose ephesians to whom with the son and holy spirit be all glory honour amp praise now and ever amen

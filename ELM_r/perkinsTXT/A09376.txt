now faith is the ground of things which are hoped for and the euidence of things not seene concerning faith points are necessary to be knowne of euery christian the doctrine amp the practise of it the whole doctrine of faith being grounded and gathered out of the word of god is comprised in the creede commonly called the apostles creede which being already by vs expounded it followeth in order next after the doctrine to lay downe also the practise of faith for which purpose wee haue chosen this chapter to the hebrewes as being a portion of scripture wherein the saide practise of faith is most excellently and at large set downe this chapter depends on the former thus we may reade in the former chapter that many iewes hauing receiued the faith and giuen their names to christ did afterward fall away therefore towards the end of the chapter there is added a notable exhortation tending to perswade the hebrewes to perseuer in faith vnto the end as also to suffer patiently what euer shall befall them in the profession of it and to vrge the exhortation there are diverse reasons not needefull to be alleadged for they concerne not the present purpose now in this chapter hee continues the same exhortation and the whole chapter as i take it is nothing else in substance but one reason to vrge the former exhortation to perseuerance in faith and the reason is drawne from the excellencie of faith for this chapter doth diverse waies set down what an excellent gift of god faith is his whole scope therfore is manifest to be nothing else but to vrge the to perseuer amp continue in that faith proued at large to be so excellent a thing amp indeed he could not bring a better argument to moue them to loue and hold fast their faith then by perswading them of the excellencie of it for common reason bids vs not onely chuse but hold fast that that is excellent out of this coherence we may learn in a word that perseuerance in faith is a matter not of ordinarie necessitie nor of mean excellecy to the vrging wherof the author of this epistle vseth so large amp so forcible an exhortation in so much as whereas ordinary exhortations occupy the roome of one or some few verses this is continued through diverse chapters the parts of this whole chapter are two a generall description of faith from the first verse to the fourth an illustration or declaration of that description by a large rehearsall of manifold examples of ancient and worthy man in the old testament from the verse to the end of these two in order the description of faith consists of three actions or effects of faith set downe in three seuerall verses the first effect in the first verse faith makes things which are not but only are hoped for after a sort to subsist and to be present with the beleeuer the is in the v faith makes a beleeuer approued of god the in the verse faith makes a man vnderstand amp beleeue things incredible to sense and reason of these effects in order now faith is the ground of things which are hoped for amp the euidence of things which are not seene this first verse containes the first effect in the description of faith wherein first let vs see the true meaning of the words secondly what instructions they do naturally yeeld vnto vs for the meaning wee must examine the words seuerally now faith faith in the word of god is specially of three sorts historicall miraculous iustifying or sauing faith historicall faith is not only a knowledge of the word but an assent of the heart to the truth of it and this faith is generall not onely to all man good and bad but euen to the diuels theselues iames thou beleeuest there is one god thou doest well the diuels also beleeue it amp tremble now he that will beleeue out of the scripture there is one god he will beleeue historically any thing in the scriptures miraculous or the faith of miracles which is an inward perswasion of the heart wrought by some speciall instinct of the holy ghost in some man whereby hee is truly perswaded that god will vse him as an instrument for the working of some miracles this also is generall both to elect and reprobate iudas had it with the rest of the apostles sauing commonly calld iustifying faith which is a speciall perswasion wrought by the holy ghost in the heart of those that are effectually called concerning their reconciliation and saluation by christ of these three sorts of faith the third is principally meant in this place and although in the description amp ouer all the chapter there are some things that agree to other faith then it yet i say the generall scope in this chapter is principally of that faith that saues a man it becomes vs therefore to learne carefully the instructions that concerne the practice of this faith for it is no lesse then a sauing faith secondly it is said this faith is the ground or substance for the word signifieth both the meaning is things hoped for as yet are not and so haue no being nor substance now faith that beleeues the promises and applieth them that faith giues to these things which yet are not after a sort a substance or subsistence in the heart of the beleeuer so that that thing which neuer had nor yet hath a being in it selfe by this faith hath a being in the heart of the beleeuer this i take to be the true meaning thirdly it followeth of what things this faith is the ground or substance namely of things hoped for and things not seene and these be of two sorts either in regard of the fathers of the old testament alone or of them and vs both of the first sort were these two the incarnation of christ the publishing of the gospell both to iew and gentile in a glorious manner both these were hoped for of them but we haue seene them to them they had a being only in faith to vs a being in themselues now vnto the fathers of the olde testament their faith gaue these two things a being in their hearts and soules though they came not to passe many hundreth yeeres after there are other things which we hope for as wel as they which are to come and not seene in respect of vs both and they be sixe these they saw not with the eye of the body neither do we yet they hoped for them and so do we they had no being in themselues to them neither haue they as yet to vs but this true sauing faith gaue to them giues to vs and will giue to euery beleeuer whilst the world lasteth such a certaine assurance of them that they seeme present to vs and we seeme presently to enioy them we cannot enioy any of them fully but sauing faith hath this power to giue them all a present being in our hearts and vs such a real possession of them as greatly delighteth a christian soule insomuch as the feeling of the sweetnesse of this glory though it be to come ouerwhelmeth the feeling of a worldly misery though it be present fourthly it is added and the euidence this word signifieth and teacheth vs two things concerning faith faith is an euidence ampc that is faith so conuinceth the minde vnderstanding and iudgement as that it cannot but must needes yes it compelleth it by force of reasons vnanswerable to beleeue the promises of god certainly it is an euidence that is whereas life euerlasting and all other things hoped for are inuisible and were neuer seen of any beleeuer since the world began this sauing faith hath this power and property to take that thing in it selfe inuisible and neuer yet seene and so liuely to represent it to the heart of the beleeuer and to the eye of his mind as that after a sort he presently seeth and enioyeth that inuisible thing and reioyceth in that sight and enioying of it and so the iudg ment is not onely conuinced that such a thing shall come to passe though it be yet to come but the minde as farre as god word hath reueald and as it is able conceiues of that thing as being really present to the view of it let one example serue for all life euerlasting is a thing hoped for now faith not onely by infallible arguments grounded vpon the word and promise of god conuinceth a mans iudgement that it shall come to passe insomuch as he dare say that he knoweth as certainly there is a life euerlasting as that he liueth and moueth but this faith also as much as god word hath reueald and as farre forth as the minde of man is able to conceiue of it so representeth this life euerlasting to the eye of the soule as that the soule seemeth to apprehend and enioy this life euerlasting yes amp often in such measure as that he contemneth the world and al the present felicity of it in coparison of that measure of the ioyes therof which faith representeth to his soule and thus faith makes that present which is absent and makes that manifest and visible which in it selfe is inuisible inuisible to the eyes of the body it makes visible to the eye of the soule the sight of which eye is both giuen and continued and daily sharpened by sauing faith and thus faith is a most excellent euidence of things not seene so then the whole sume of this first effect is briefly thus much whereas things to be beleeued as perfection of sanctification resurrection glorification ampc are not yet seene neither can be in that they are not yet come to passe yet if a man haue grace certainly to beleeue the promises of god these things shall haue a being to his soule in that both his iudgement knoweth assuredly they shall come to passe and his soule in most liuely and ioyfull representations seemeth to enioy them hitherto of the meaning of the first effect now in the second place let vs see what instructions this first effect thus vnfolded doth minister vnto vs first whereas faith giues a substance and being to things that are not we learne that the fathers in the old testament that liued afore the incarnation of christ were truly partakers of the body and bloud of christ if any alledge that this is strange considering that christ had the no body amp bloud neither had he any vntil the incarnatio amp how the could they receiue that which the was not i grant it is true they the had no being and yet the fathers receiued the but how can this be i answer by the wonderfull power of sauing faith which makes things that are not in nature to haue in some sort a being amp subsistence and so was christ though he was to come present to the beleeuers of the old time for apocrypha christ is a lambe slaine from the beginning of the world that is slaine as wel then as now and that not only in y e counsell amp decree of god wherby he is borne amp slaine in all times and places nor onely in regard of the eternal power efficacie and merit of his death but also euen in respect of the heart of the beleeuer whose faith makes that that is locally absent after a sort truly and really present euen so also is christ a lambe slaine euen from the beginning of the world see a plaine demonstration hereof in ioh abraham saw me saith christ and reioiced how could this be when as christ was not borne of yeares after ans this could not be in reason but it was indeed to abrahams faith wherby he saw christ more liuely and more to his ioy amp consolation so many yeares afore he was the many which liued in christs time and saw him and heard him and conuer ed with him for they liuing with him yet were as good as absent from him because they beleeued not in him and abraham though christ was so far from him yet by his faith was present with him againe corinthian the ancient beleeuing israelites ate the same spirituall bread and dranke the same spirituall rocke and that rocke was christ how could they eate and drinke christ so long afore he was i answere they did it by reason of that wonderfull power of faith which makes a thing absent present to the beleeuer by that faith they receiued christ as liuely as effectually as much to their profit and comfort as we do since his comming if any man aske how could their faith apprehend that that then was not i answer by giuing them interest amp title to it and so the fathers are said by faith to haue receiued christ because their faith gaue them right and title in christ and in their hearts they felt the efficacie of his death amp resurrection whereby they died to sin and were renewed in holinesse as well as we are now by the same efficacie secondly whereas faith makes things absent present here they are confuted that teach that the lord supper is no sacrament vnlesse the body amp bloud of christ be either truly turned into the bread amp wine or at least be in or about the bread amp that so he is locally present amp must locally and substantially be receiued and this say they is the most cofortable receiuing of christ for what comfort is it to receiue one absent but these man know not this notable prerogatiue of true faith faith giues being to things which are not and makes things present which are absent they therefore that will haue christ locally present they take this noble prerogatiue from faith for here is nothing absent which faith should make present we neede not goe in this sacrament to require a corporall presence it is sufficient if wee haue true faith for that makes him present much more comfortably then it might be his bodily presence would be vnto vs if any man aske how this can be i answer the faith of the receiuer knoweth best and yet reason can say something in this case for suppose a man looke earnestly vpon a starre there are many thousand of miles between his eye amp the star yet the starre and his eye are so vnited together as that the starre is after a sort present to his eye so if we regard locall distance we are as farre from christ as earth is from heauen but if we regard the nature of faith which is to reach it selfe to christ where euer he be in that regard christ is present and why should not this be so for if the bodily eye so feeble and weake can reach so farre as to a starre and ioyne it to it selfe and so make it present why should not much more the piercing eye of the soule reach vp to christ amp make him present to the comfortable feeling of it selfe thirdly here wee learne how to behaue our selues in a strange temptation whereby god vseth to exercise his children the lord after that he hath receiued his children into his fauour cotinueth not alwaies to manifest that fauour vnto them but often times puls back the feeling of it for a time that afterward hee may shew it againe in more comfortable manner vnto them and that they may afterward more sensibly feele it and more earnestly loue it and more carefully labour to keepe it when they haue it now for the time of this eclipse of the fauour of god he not onely darkeneth his loue but makes them feele also such a measure of his wrath as that they will often thinke themselues castawayes from the fauour of god dauid and io were often exercised with this temptation as appeareth by their most lamentable amp bitter coplaints yes dauid doubts not psalm to chalenge the lord that he hath forgotten to be gratious and hath shut vp his louing kindnesse in displeasure and iob chap complaines to the lord that he writeth bitter things against him and makes him to possesse the sinnes of his youth words as it may seem of man forsaken of god and indeed so for that time they thought of themselues if it please the lord thus to deale with vs so as we feele nothing else but his wrath wrastling with our consciences neither can think otherwise by present feeling but that god hath forsaken vs what should we do in this pitifull case should we despaire as reason would bid vs no but take this course call to mind god mercifull promises and his ancient former loue and cast thy selfe vpo that loue though thou canst not feele it when thou hast most cause to despaire then labour against it when thou hast no reason to beleeue then beleeue with all thy power for remeber the power amp prerogatiue of thy faith it beleeues not things that are amp manifestly appeare so much as such things that are not amp haue no being so then when god fauour seemes to be lost and to haue no being to thee then is god fauour a fit obiect for thy faith which beleeues those things that are not let al the diuels in hell set themselues against thy poore soule and if thou holdest fast this faith they cannot all make thee sinke vnder it for when the diuel saith thou hast lost god fauour by faith a man answereth though god fauour be lost vnto my feeling yet to my faith it is not my faith giues it a being amp so long say what thou wilt i will neuer feare that it is lost when god puls back his fauour and fights against thee with his wrath do as iacob did gen wrestle with god though thou haue but one legge that is though thou haue but one little sparke of faith fight with that little faith lay hold by it on god and let him not go vntill he hath blessed thee in turning again vnto thee his fauorable countenance and say with iob euen in the very heate of thy temptation o lord though thou kil this body and flesh of mine yet will i trust in thee for euerlasting life yes amp though god anger should seeme to encrease yet for all that take faster hold and faint not for faith will neuer faile thee it will restore god loue when it seemes lost it wil set it before thine eyes when it seemes to be hid for marke well but this one reason if faith will giue life euerlasting a being and make it present to thy soule which indeede yet neuer had being to thee how much more can it giue a being to god fauour and make it present to thy soule which once had amp indeed hath still a being and was neuer lost indeede but onely to a mans feeling thus true faith is able to answer this temptaation whether it come in life or in the pangs of death fourthly whereas faith is calld an euidence hence wee learne that the nature of faith stands not in doubting but in certainty amp assurance the roman doubting of the essence of faith is as contrary to true faith as darknesse to light for faith is an euidence of things hoped for that is it couinceth the iudgemet by vnfallible arguments knowing as certainly the truth of the promises amp of the things hoped for as that god is god but rome wil needs ioin faith amp doubting which in deed fight like fire and water and can neuer agree together in euery respect but one wil in the end destroy the other obiection but it seemeth doubting is a part or at least a companion of faith for we doubt as wel as beleeue amp who is so faithful that doubteth not answer we do so but what then we should not for god comands vs to beleeue amp not to doubt therefore to beleeue because it is commanded of god is a vertue and if it be a vertue then to doubt is a vice faith amp doubting are both in a good man but faith is a work of grace and of the spirit doubting is a work of the flesh amp a piece of the corruption of the old man fiftly if faith be a substance of things hoped for much more is it a substance to the beleeuer if it giue those things a being which a e out of him much more doth it giue a permanent being vnto the beleeuer himselfe strengthning him to stand amp continue in al assaults so heb faith is that whereby a beleeuer is sustained amp vpholden so that indeed we may fitly say faith is the spiritual substance and the spiritual strength of a christian man and according to the measure of his faith such is the measure of his spirituall strength this cosideration hath diverse comfortable vses but especially two when any of vs are out of the reach of a temptation so long are we confident of our owne strength but when we are assaulted by the diuel the world and our owne flesh then we shal find that to resist is a harder matter then we dreamed of for as possible as it is for water to burne or fire to put out it selfe so possible is it for vs of our selues to resist sin insomuch as it is a thousand to one but that at euery assault our nature yeelds now if it be so hard to rule ouer one sin how shal we do against that sea of temptations that ouerwhelmeth a christian life this doctrine teacheth thee how namely to stick to thy faith and it wil doe it for thee for if it be the substance of the things thou hopest for which yet neuer were much more wil it yeeld vnto thee spirituall strength amp substance to make thee stand in all temptations when thou article tempted then call to minde god promises beleeue them that is apply them to thy selfe and be resolued that they were made amp shall be performed euen to thee the though thou haue no more power of thy self then fire hath to cease to burne yet whilst thou doest thus thou shalt feele thy soule spiritually strengthned against all temptations amp feeling the experience of this deny the thine own strength amp magnifie the power that god hath giuen vnto true faith againe though now we are most of vs quiet vnder our owne vines and figtrees yet we know not how soon the hand of the lord may be vpon any of vs in pouerty sicknesse imprisonment banishment losses famines or how it pleaseth him how shal a poore christian stand and buckle himselfe to beare these i answer true sauing faith resting on the word of god amp beleeuing the promises not formally but truly wil put such substantiall spirituall strength into him as that at first though he bow vnder it yet shal he be able to recouer himself again amp buckle himself to go forward in his profession amp shal follow christ manfully with this his crosse this wonderful power hath god giuen to sauing faith both to resist temptations and to vndergoe all crosses and thus much of the first action or effect of faith the second foloweth for by it our elders were well reported of this verse containeth the second effect of sauing faith which is that faith is a meanes whereby a beleeuer is approued of god this verse hath speciall relation to the fift verse for that that is said here of all the elders in generall is there affirmed specially of enoch namely that hee was reported of to haue pleased god let vs first search the true meaning of the words elders that is all such man as liuing vnder the old testament beleeued in christ amongst which though all be vnderstood yet some were more excellent in faith amp obedience then others amp so more honorable and of higher estimation with god and man and of them it is specially vnderstood now concerning these elders it is further said that they were well reported of hereby are meant three things for the it may be asked how were they approued of god ans christ the son of god is he in whom the father is well pleased now they beleeuing in christ their sinnes were laid on him and made his by imputation and contrariwise his holinesse obedience and satisfaction were imputed to them and by the same imputation made theirs now that being theirs god being so well pleased with christ could not but also for christs sake approue of them if this seeme hard vnto any i make it plain by this comparison looke as iacob a yonger brother puts on esaus garment the elder brother amp in it was take for esau amp obtained his fathers blessing amp patrimony which by himselfe he could not haue got euen so we are as younger brother christ is our elder brother we haue no right nor title to our fathers blessing nor to the kingdome of heauen wee must put on the robe of perfect righteousnesse which is the garment of christ our elder brother we standing clothed with purchase our fathers fauour and with his fauour his ble ng and his blessing is the right and title to euerlasting life and thus by christ they were approued secondly for what were they approued the text saith by faith not because faith is an action of a sanctified minde and a good grace of god for so are humility loue feare of god al which are graces of the sanctifying spirit as faith is but because it is a worthy instrument in the heart of the beleeuer which apprehends and applieth to the soule that righteousnesse of christ by which he is iustified thus it being the hand and instrument of their iustification by it it is said they were approued the text addeth that god did not onely approue of them but that he testified and made it manifest to all the world that he did so and this testimony god gaue of them in his word in their owne consciences the truth of the first is manifest in that not onely in this chapter but often also in the old testament god hath m de such honourable mention and giuen such honourable titles vnto many of these elders calling abraham the friend of god chronicle and dauid a man after god own heart sam and them all his anointed and deare chosen children psalm thus god hath testified of them in his word god testified it to their owne consciences in that hee gaue them his spirit inwardly to assure their cosciences that he did accept them in the messias to come and thus these elders receiued a testimonie both outward to all the world amp inward to their consciences that god in christ approued and loued them so the sense is plaine the vse hereof manifold in that it is said these elders were approued by faith here wee learne what is the olde and ancient way the right and straight way that hath no by wayes to life euerlasting namely this only to rely on the mercy of god in christ for pardon of sin this is the way wherein all the ancient elders walked to heauen this is the way that god hath opened amp made vnto his court it is the kings high way the beaten way common to euery one that knowes how to walke in it amp deceiued none that euer went in it amp beside which there is no other seeing then god hath consecrated it amp our elders haue trode this way before vs let vs folow them that so we may attain that kingdom wherto it hath brought them if any yet doubt whether this be the way or no the spirit of god puts it out of doubt esay first affirming peremptorily this is the way secondly bidding vs therefore walke in the same this is the way walke in it our elders obayed this commaundement of the spirit and walking in this way found the end of it euerlasting life if we would attaine the same end of the iourney we must walke the same way but the world will say this is a needlesse exhortation for we walke this way we deny our selues and looke to be approued of god onely by christ but it is strange to see how man deceiue themselues can a man walke in a way and not leaue marks amp steps behind him euen so he that walks in this way follow him amp you shal see steps of his continuall dying vnto sinne amp liuing vnto holinesse insomuch that a man that followeth him amp marketh the course of his life in this way may euidently say see where hee hath cast off amp left behind him this amp that sin see where he hath taken vp amp caried with him these amp those vertues amp graces of god marke here is a print of his faith here is a print of his hope here are prints of his loue and thus may a child of god be followed amp traced all the way to heauen euen vntil he come to his death which is the gate of heauen how mightily the are they deceiued which think they haue walked all their liues in this way and yet there is not one step to be seene for assuredly this way is so beat n and troden that no man euer trode in it since the world began but he left behind him manifest amp visible steps that all man that would looke at him might see he had gone that way as therfore we all desire to come to heauen amp as we professe we walk in the way thither so let vs be as carefull to leaue behind vs our steps namely tokens amp prints of our faith our hope and loue which if we do then mark the excellent vse of those steps they testifie vnto all that see them that we walked the right way to heauen and secondly they wil serue for marks amp directions for the that shal walke in the same way after vs by the we shal leaue an honorable testimony of our selues behind vs by the we shall moue other to magnify god name to who our steps haue bin marks amp directions helps amp furtherances in the way to heauen secondly for what were these elders approued for their faith for nothing else amongst these elders sampson was wonderfull in strength salomon in wisedome ioshua in courage moses in learning many of them in the honour and pompe of the world in beauty riches and other externall gifts and the most of them all in long life yet not for one or all of these are any of them saide to be regarded of god but it is plainely said that for their faith god did approue them here then learne what is the thing amongst all things that must make vs acceptable vnto god euen this to deny our selues and to rest vpon the mercy of god in christ this wil do it amp nothing else hast thou stregth so had golias as wel as sampson hast thou beauty so had absalom as wel or more the dauid hast thou wisdom so had achitophel thogh not like salomon yet aboue ordinary man hast thou riches esau was richer the iacob hast thou liued long so did cain amp ismael as wel as isaac hast thou many childre so had ahab as wel as gedeon hast thou learning the glory of nature so had the egyptians as well as moses for there moses learned it all these thou maist haue amp yet be a vile person in the sight of god so far from being approued of god as that he wil not vouchsafe vnlesse it be in his anger once to regard or looke at thee hast thou therefore any of those outward gifts it is not to be contemned it hath his vse thanke god for it and and vse it well and vse it so as by it thou maist be approued amongst man but stand not to it before god for though it be wisedome or learning or neuer so excellent a gift it cannot purchase the fauour amp acceptation of god but true faith is able to please god both in this life and especially at the day of iudgement this doctrine first confuteth the error of some grosse papists who hold and write that many philosophers for their good vse of the light of nature for their deepenesse of learning and for their ciuill liues are now saints in heauen a most manifest and shamefull vntruth and here as manifestly confuted for was salomon not accepted for all his wisedome and shall socrates was moses not accepted for all his learning how then should aristotle if faith made all of them accepted and nothing but faith how is it possible they should be accepted which neuer heard of faith nay i say more if many a man that liueth in the church as deepe it may be in humane learning as they and of great knowledge also in the whole doctrine of religion which they neuer knew and yet could not nor euer shall be accepted of god onely for want of this sauing faith how absurd is it imagine saluation for them which neither had sparke of faith nor knowledge of christ let vs the hold that as there is no name whereby to be saued but onely the name of christ so no meanes to be saued by that christ but onely faith euen that faith for which these elders were accepted of god secondly this excellencie of faith aboue all other gifts shewes the vanity of the world so carefull amp earnest in seeking honour riches credit wisedom learning all which can but make them esteemed and approued to the world and so carelesse and negligent in getting true faith which will both approue a man vnto the world and make him honorable in the eyes of the lord god thirdly by this doctrine the popish doctrine is iustly condemned which teacheth that a man is iustified by his works and that faith is not the most excellent of god graces here we are taught other diuinitie for that for which a man is accepted by that he is iustified but for their faith onely were they accepted therfore iustification is only by faith againe that which makes a man accepted of god that must needs be the most excellent thing of all for god which is goodnesse it selfe regardeth that that is the best but god esteemed the only for their faith therfore it is the chief of all graces of god in regard of making a man accepted of god fourthly here is a patterne and president for god children how to bestow amp measure out their loue amp estimation in the world god loued salomon more for his faith then for all his glory and wisedome and esteemed more of moses for his faith the for all his learning so deale thou with thy wife thy child thy servant thy friend amp with all man hast thou a wife neuer so beautifull louing honest amp thrifty neuer so toward and obedient a child a most wise amp trusty servant a friend for faithfulnesse like thine owne soule these are indeed much to be esteemed yet thinke not thy selfe in a paradise whe thou hast such for there is a greater matter behind then all these looke therfore further is thy wife thy child thy servant thy friend endued with sauing faith that is worth more then all the rest that is it which makes them beloued of god let that therfore make them best beloued of thee and that which makes them so honourable before god let that make them most honourable and most esteemed of thee so in all man loue that in a man best which god loueth and so thou shalt be sure not to lose thy loue esteeme of a man not as the world esteemeth not according to his strength beauty high place or outward gifts but as god esteemeth him namely according to the measure of sauing faith which thou seest in him for is not that worthy of thy loue which hath purchased the loue of the lord god himselfe fiftly here is comfort for all such servant of god as hauing true faith yet are in base estimation for worldly respects some are poore some in base callings some deformed in body some of meane gifts many in great distresse and misery all their liues most of them some way or other contemptible in the world yet let not this discomfort any child of god but let them consider what it is that makes them approued of god not beauty strength riches wisdom learning all these may perish in the vsing but true faith if then thou hast that thou hast more then all the rest if thou hadst all them they could but make thee esteemed in the world but hauing true faith thou article esteemed of god and what matter then who esteemes thee and who not this crosseth the corrupt censure of the world who more esteem a man for his outward gifts and glory of riches or learning then for sauing graces let god children when they are based contemned mocked and kept from all place and preferment in the world let them i say appeale from this vniust iudgement to the iudgement of god and be coforted in this that though they want all things without them that should make them esteemed in the world yet they haue that within them for which god wil esteeme approue and acknowledge them both in this world and in the world to come and they haue that that will stand by them when strength and beauty are vanished when learning amp riches and honour are all ended with the world thus much of the second doctrine in that our elders by faith obtained a good report here we learne the readiest and surest way to get a good name a good name is a good gift of god ecclesiastes it is a pretious ointment it is a thing that all man would haue these elders had it and they haue laide vs downe a platforme how to get it and it is this get into fauour with god please him that is cofesse thy sins bewaile them get pardon set the promises of god in christ before thee beleeue the apply them to thy selfe as thine owne be perswaded in thy conscience that christ did all for thee and that he hath purchased thy acceptation with god thus when thou article assured that god approues of thee god can easily giue thee a comfortable testimony in thine owne conscience and hee can moue the hearts of all man to think wel and open their mouthes to speake wel of thee for he hath the hearts of all man in his hand and therfore those that are in his fauor he can bend the hearts of all man to approue the yet this must be vnderstood with some cautions god wil not procure his childre a good name amongst all man for then they should be cursed for luke cursed are yee when all man speake well of you but the lord meaneth that they shal be accepted amp haue a good name with the most amp with the best for indeed a good name as all other graces of god cannot be perfect in this life but they shal haue such a good name as in this world shall continue and increase and in the world to come be without all blot for sin is the disgrace of a man therefore when sin is abolished good name is perfect god will not procure all his children a good name nor alwaies for a good name is of the same nature with other externall gifts of god sometime they are good to a man sometime hurtfull to some man good to others hurtfull euery one therefore that hath true faith may not absolutely assure himselfe of a good name but as farre forth as god shall see it best for his owne glory and his good the good name that god wil giue his children stands not so much in outward comendation and speaking wel of a man as in the inward approbation of the consciences of man they must therfore be content somtime to be abused mocked slandered amp yet notwithstading they haue a good name in the chief respect for they whose mouthes do abuse amp condemne the their very consciences do approue them out of all these the point is manifest that god will procure his children a good name in this world as far forth as it is a blessing and not a curse and that because they are approued of him and by faith iustified in his sight for so to be is the onely way to get a good name for in reason it stands thus that those who are in estimation and good name with the lord himselfe much more will god make them esteemed and giue them a good name with man like themselues hence we learne first that the comon course of the world to get a good name is fond amp wicked and to no purpose they labour for riches preferments honor wisdom amp learning by them to get estimatio in the world yes many abuse these blessings in vaine ostentation to encrease their credit and name with man and in the meane time sauing faith is neuer remembred which must procure them a good name with god this is a wrong course first we must labour to be approued of god and then after the good name with god followeth the good name in the world he therefore that labours for fauour with man and neglects the fauour of god he may get a good name but it shall proue a rotten name in the end prou the memoriall of the iust shall be blessed but the name of the wicked shall rot the good name of the wicked is rotten because it is loathsom amp stinking in the face of god though it be neuer so glorious in the world because it will not last the wearing out but in the end vanisheth and comes to nothing vnlesse as a rotting thing leaues some corruption behind it so their good name in the end being vanished leaues infamy behind it and this is the name which commonly is gotten in the world because man first seeke not a good name with god but that good name which is obtained by faith will stand amp continue all a mans life and at his death leaue behind it a sweet perfume amp abideth for euer in the world to come secondly this maintaines the excellencie of our religion against atheists and all enemy of it which esteeme amp call it a base amp conteptible religion amp of which ca folow no credit nor estimation but see their malice is here controlled our religion is a most glorious amp excellent professio it is the high way to get true credit amp estimation it makes a ma honorable in the sight of god amp man for by it our elders obtained a good report which continueth fresh to this day in the fourth place were they wel reported of for their faith therefore their faith was not hid in their hearts but manifested in their liues for the world cannot see nor commend them for their faith but for the practice of faith here it is plaine that man must not be content to keep their faith close in their hearts but they must exercise the fruites of it in the world and then both these together will make a man truly commendable thy faith approues thee vnto god but the practice of it is that that honours thee and thy profession in the world lastly in that faith was that which approued our elders vnto god here is a storehouse of comforts for all true professors of this faith article thou poore thy faith doth make thee rich in god article thou simple and of meane reach thy faith is true wisedome before god article thou any way deformed faith makes thee beautifull vnto god article thou weake feeble or sicke thy faith doth make thee strong in god article thou base in the world and of no account thy faith makes thee honourable in the sight of god and his holy angels thus thou article poore and foolish and deformed and sicke and base in the world but marke how god hath recompensed thee he hath giuen thee faith whereby thou article rich and beautifull amp wise and strong amp honorable in heauen with god say therfore with dauid the lot is fallen vnto thee in a faire ground and thou hast a goodly heritage namely thy faith which thou wouldest not change for all the glory of the world faith is the true riches the sound strength the lasting beauty the true wisedome the true honour of a christian man therefore take thy selfe times more beholden vnto god then if hee had giuen thee the vncertaine riches the crafty and yet foolish wisedome the decaying strength the vanishing beauty the transitory honour of this world if thou hast true faith thou article sure to haue many enemy the wicked of the world will neuer brooke thee but openly or priuily hate amp hurt thee the the diuel is thy sworn enemie how canst thou deale with so powerfull an enemie and all his wicked instruments here is sound comfort if thou hast faith thou hast god thy friend labour therefore for this true faith and then care not for the diuel and all his power night and day sleeping and waking by land amp sea thou article safe and secure the diuel cannot hurt thee thy faith makes thee accepted of god and brings thee within the compasse of his protection that same little sparke of faith which is in so narrow a compasse as thy heart is stronger the all the power and malice of sathan as for the malice which his instruments wicked me in this world shew against thee in mocks and abuses much lesse care for them for their nature is to speake euill and cannot doe otherwise looke not therfore at them but looke vp into heauen by the eye of thy soule where thy faith makes thee beloued and approued of god himselfe and honourable in the presence of his holy angels and thus much of the second action or effect of faith the third followeth through faith wee vnderstand that the world was ordained by the word of god so that the things which wee see are not made of things which did appeare in this verse is contained the third action or effect of faith namely this faith makes a man to vnderstand things beyond the reach of mans reason this third effect is set out in these words by the instance of a notable exsample namely of the creation of the world by the word of god of nothing both which that wee may the better vnderstand let vs consider of the words as they lye in order by faith in this place as i take it is not meant that sauing faith which iustifies a man before god but a generall faith wherby a man imbraceth christian religion or wherby a man beleeueth the word of god in the doctrine of the law and the gospel to be true my reason is because a man that neuer had iustifying and sauing faith and is no member of the catholike church nor childe of god may haue this gift to beleeue that god by his word made the world of nothing therefore i thinke that this is an action of a generall and not of sauing faith that is whereas there are many things beyond the reach of reason and therefore by reason cannot be apprehended or vnderstood yet by vertue of this faith a man is brought to vnderstand them and to beleeue them to be true now then whereas generall faith brings vnderstanding of many things which reason cannot reach vnto here such as be students in humane learning amp which labour to attain to the deepenesse and perfection of it are taught with their trauell in humane studies to haue care to ioyne faith and knowledge of religion for there are many things which our vnderstanding by reason cannot conceiue and many truthes which philosophy cannot reach vnto nay many also which it denies but faith is able to perswade and demonstrate them all and it inlightens the mind and rectifies the iudgement when as philosophy hath left the mind in darknesse and the iudgement in error now in whom sound knowledge in philosophy and this faith in religion do concurre together he is a man of a most rectified iudgement and of a deepe reach in the greatest matters but separate faith from humane knowledge and he will stumble at many truthes though hee had the wit of all the philosophers in his owne head for exsample that god should make the world of nothing that it should haue beginning amp ending that god should be eternall and not the world that mans soul being created is immortal these amp many other truths reaso canot see amp therfore philosophy wil not admit but ioin faith to it amp then that crooked vnderstanding is rectified amp made to beleeue it it is therfore good counsel to ioyn both these together religion hinders not humane learning as some fondly thinke but is a furtherance and helpe or rather the perfection of humane learning perswading and prouing and conuincing that which humane learning cannot and thus we see how faith makes vs to vnderstand but what doth it make vs to vnderstand the text saith that the world was ordained ampc amongst many expositions we may most safely set downe and approue this god by his word or comandement hath ordained that is made in good order the ages that is the world and all in it and all this he did by his word and which is more strange then that made them all of nothing that is a wonderfull thing reason coceiues it not but disputes against it philosophy grants it not but writes against it but marke the priuiledge of this faith it makes a man beleeue it and shewes him also how it is now for our better perceiuing the excellency of this power of faith here are points set downe what was created the worlds in what manner ordained by what meanes by god word of what matter of nothing of these in order the first point is what was made the text answereth the worlds the word signifieth in the originall ages and so it is also taken heb god made the worlds or ages by christ by this word then hee meaneth these two things first times and seasons which are ordinary creatures of god as well as other for amongst other creatures gen are recorded also times amp seasons to be god creatures secondly he vnderstandeth the world also and all in it and so it is truly translated for with good reason may the word ages signifie the world because the world and all in it had their beginning in time haue their continuance in time and shall haue their end in time againe time begun them time continues them and time shal end them and so the world is euerie way measured by the compasse of time and therefore it pleaseth the holy ghost to tearme the world and all in it ages or times now whereas it is said ages that is times and seasons were ordained of god we learne that if time be a creature or an ordinance of god created for so great purposes as to be the measure of all things take heed then of abusing so excellent an ordinance if thou hast spent it well spend it still better time is so good a thing it cannot be spent well enough but hast thou misspent time that is to abuse it take s pauls counsell ephesians redeeme the time that is seeing what is past cannot be recalld then recompence the losse of it by the well bestowing of time to come spend euerie houre well and that thou maist do so be alwaies either doing good to other or receiuing good from other doe either and time is well spent and take heede thou be not of the number of those that often say they cannot tell how to driue away time and therfore they deuise many toyes amp coceits and vaine pleasures yes many wicked amp vnlawful delights and all to shift off as they say and deceiue the time it is wonderfull to see that the wicked whose time of ioy is onely in this world should seeke to hasten it amp make it seem shorter yet so it is the diuel blinding them but howeuer it is seeme it shorter or longer that same one sinne of misspending their time shall condemne them if they had no more for if account must be giuen for euery idle word a fearefull account remaines to be made for so many idle houres let vs then be very carefull in the vse of this good ordinance of god and neuer deuise how to passe away time for there is no man that is a profitable member in the place where he is that can finde one houre so idle that he knowes not how to imploy it either in receiuing or doing some good the second point in this example is the maner did god make a perfect or an imperfect world the text answereth it was ordained the word signifieth thus much god framed the ages that is all creatures visible and inuisible in a most excellent perfect amp absolute order as in a campe euerie man keepes his ranke and order and no man goeth out of his standing appointed him so euery creature had his due place and his proper vse assigned him of god so that the workmanship of the world in euery creature amp in euery respect was absolute and thus ordained is as much as perfectly made and the whole world was as the perfect body of a man where euery member bone ioynt veine amp sinew is in his proper place and nothing out of square ob was euery thing created in his order and due place whence then com so many disorders in the world the diuel hath his kingdome authoritie lawes amp subiects he rules in the wicked now ca there be any order in sathans kingdom againe whence are so many alterations and subuersions of kingdomes so many war so much effusion of bloud the gospel is transported fro country to country ciuil dissensions in cities amp priuate families between ma amp man between man amp some creatures between creature and creatures yes hatred often vnto the death yes often hatred between creatures of the same kind all these being so where then is that excellent order wherein they were created i answere the state of all creatures is changed from that wherein they were created by the fall of our first parents god made no disorder he saw euery thing that he had made and lo it was very good therfore it was in a most perfect order for orderly comelinesse is a part of the goodnesse of a thing but disorder is the effect of sinne it entred with sinne and it is both a companion and a reward of sinne had we continued in our innocence all creatures had continued in their excellent order but when wee had broken the perfect order that god had appointed vs immediatly all creatures broke that order wherin they were afore both towards vs amp one amongst another whilst we obayed god all creatures obayed vs but when wee shooke off the yoke of obedience vnto god and rebelled against him then they became disobedient vnto vs whilst we loued god al creatures loued amp reuerenced vs but when we fell to hate the lord then began they to hate vs and not before if therefore thou seest any disobedience and hatred in the creatures towards thee any disorder and vanity amongst themselues thank thy selfe for it thou broughtst it into the world with thy sinne this being so we are hence taught when wee see any disorder in any creature not to blame the lord nor the creature but to turne backe to our selues to take notice of our owne sinnes and corruptions and to acknowledge this was not so at the first but our sin was the cause of it and therfore be humbled amp ashamed of our selues that we should destroy and confound that excellent order which god made and all creatures but for vs would haue kept till this day but the comon practice is contrary as i wil proue in particulars god made mans body pure and holy amp therfore it had no need to be couerd but with sin came shame amp thence came it that god gaue vs apparell to couer that shame that sin had brought vpon vs so oft therfore as a man puts on his apparell he should be humbled amp ashamed by it and think thus with himselfe this was not so at the first adams body was glorious whence came this ignominie amp shame which we must couer with apparel it came from my sin therfore so often as a man puts it on so oft should he be quite ashamed of himselfe which hath brought this shame vpo himselfe so as now he must needs haue a cloake to couer his shame but do me make this end of their apparel nay rather they make it a banner to display their pride and vanity and so farre are many from being ashamed of it as that they are contrariwise proud of it but this is as abhominable amp cursed and senselesse a pride as if the prisoner should be proud of his bolts amp fetters which are signes of his misdemeanour for what is thy apparel make the best of it it is but a beautiful cloake of thy filthy shame then as bolts amp fetters are burdenous and shamefull though they be of gold so is the cloake of thy shame thy apparel thogh it be silk siluer or gold for we shold not be ashamed only of ordinary aparel or base but eue of the most gorgeous knowing that once wee had a glory of our owne farre aboue all the glory of apparell and the ignominie that sin hath brought vpon vs is greater then this glorie of apparell can take away here i deny not the vse of gorgeous apparell to those to whom it belongs but i say to rich man who by their abilitie to man in authoritie who by their place and calling may weare costly apparell yes and to princes who may lawfully weare silk siluer gold and the most excellent ornaments of pretious stones or whatsoeuer to all the i say god hath granted you the vse of these but withall be not proud of them for you once had a glory greater then these but lost it by sin amp sin brought a shame which those cannot hide for though thy apparel hide it fro the world yet can it not fro god only faith can couer it fro god therfore glory in nothing but thy faith be ashamed of thy apparell yes of thy robes amp costly ornamets and know further that wheras thy body by sin is becom so vile a meaner couer amp baser apparel were fit for it and therfore know that wheras god hath giuen thee vse of costly apparell and pretious ornaments he giues them not to honour thy body but the place thou article in and to adorne that part of his owne image which he hath set in thee by thy calling and know lastly that if thou hadst kept that order wherein god at thy creation as this text saith ordained thee thy natural glory would more haue adorned thee and the place thou bearest then all this accidentall and artificiall glory can and therfore glory not so much for the one as be ashamed for the losse of the other and let thy apparell teach thee this lesson thirdly many man take much delight in some kinde of meate some in variety of meates and some so loue their belly as they care not how many creatures or kindes of creatures do dye for their belly sake this is to be considered for i take it a great fault for man either to be too lauish and carelesse how many creatures they cause to die or though they eate but one kinde to doe it without all vse or further consideration for marke whence comes this that man cannot now liue or not so well but his life must be the death of other creatures his nourishment and preseruation the destruction of other creatures at the beginning before sinne was this was not so no creature did either serue to cloathe or feed adam but this came with sin sin brought this vanitie vpon creatures to die for the feeding and cloathing of man and had we stood without sin no creature should haue lost his life to be our meate i take it therefore the duty of a man to make great vse of his meate in this regard and first for the meate that he loues best let him be humbled for his sinne knowing that if hee had not sinned hee should haue had much more sweetnesse in other meate which notwithstanding should not haue cost any creature his life and secondly for variety be not too lauish nor too riotous consider euery dish is the death of a creature of god creation consider againe whence comes this that creatures must die to feed thee not from the creation creatures were not made to that end innocencie would haue preserued all creatures to more excellent ends sinne it was and thy sinne that destroyes so many creatures for the belly of man it is a vanitie come vpon creatures for mans sinne that they must die for mans meate the death therefore of euery creature should be a corsiue to a mans heart when hee seeth it it should touch him to the quicke and make him say this creature dieth not for it selfe but for mee not for it owne fault but for mine miserable sinner that i am if i had right i should rather die then it god made it once for a better end but my sinne hath brought it to this corruption if this consideration tooke place man would not eate their ordinary fare with so little vse nor at extraordinarie occasions be so carelesse how much they spend and how many creatures they cause to die but you will say god hath giuen vs libertie in meates differences of meats are taken away in christ and god hath giuen vs vse of his creatures not onely for necessitie but more liberall vse euen for greater delight and comfort i answer i grant all this and more too to a man that hath faith i grant feasts and bankets are lawful for some man on some occasions i take not away any mans liberty in meates god hath granted it and man ought not to take it away i onely wish that when we eate wee also would make this vse of it and that we would not too riotously abuse that liberty that god hath giuen vs for diuersity of meates faith giues vs leaue and liberty to eate yet faith denies not a man to make a holy vse of his eating for his owne humiliation but rather commaunds it fourthly wee see in the world that creatures not onely dye for mans feeding but one creature feedes on another and one destroyeth another to eate him the hawke preyeth on diverse kindes of birdes the foxe feedeth on tame birds the wolfe on the lambe greater fish deuoure the lesse dogges will eate diverse kindes of creatures if they can come by them these things are manifest and some of them be common sports in the world now whence comes this feareful disorder in nature that one creature should deuoure another came it from the creation was the world ordained in this state that one creature should eate vp another the greater feed vpon the lesse no but sin brought this cofusion our sin caused this pitiful massacre of all creatures one by another let vs therfore at these sights be humbled for our sinne which caused so fearefull a disorder when thou seest thy hawke flie so fiercely and so cruelly murder a seely bird thy hound the hart hare or connie then as god hath giuen thee leaue in good order measure and manner thus to deale with the creatures and therefore thou maist take delight in it so withall make this vse of it whence comes this it was not so from the beginning when sinne was not in the world these would all haue lodged in one cage and cabbin and one neuer haue offred to haue eaten another my sinne caused this iarre and this disorder between these two creatures this should humble a man because of his sinne and restraine his life fro too much liberty and his affection from too much delight in these kind of pastimes againe when we see the cruelty of the foxe the wolfe the beare toward the sheepe and other creatures blame not too much the cruelty of the beast for this was not in them at their creation but thy sinne made them thus cruell one against another turne then into thy selfe and be ashamed of it and blame not so much the cruelty in them as thine owne sinne which caused it in them againe some creatures are vnperfect some in parts of their body some in some senses and some are loathsome amp vgly to behold and some are venomous and hurtfull to the world whe thou seest it consider whence is this they were not thus created for god ordained that is made all creatures in perfect order but this comes from thy sinne enter into thy selfe and acknowledge this and be humbled for it and do not so much contemne this creature for his imperfection nor loath him for his deformity nor hate him for his venome as contemne and loathe and hate thine owne sinnes which were the cause of all these lastly some take great delight in faire buildings amp make no vse of them but for delight and pleasure but if they cosider wel they haue no such cause it was not so at the creation adam in his innocencie had a more sumptuous palace ordained for him namely the paradise of heauen and earth and yet trees were not cut in pieces nor the earth had her stones rent out of her bowels for the building of it thy sinne it was that destroyed this palace and sinne hath caused the necessitie of these buildings how then canst thou glory in thy buildings wilt thou glory in thy shame canst thou be proud of these when thy sinne bereft thee of a better as therefore thy house is a comfort strength security and delight vnto thee so adde this one vse also let it in this consideration be a cause to humble thee for thy sinne the disorder that sin hath brought into the world might be shewed in more particulars but these may suffice being those of whom we haue most common vse and therefore do most commonly abuse to conclude this point i say vnto all man doest thou see what disorder is now in the world in thy apparell meate recreations buildings seest thou the confusion vanity corruption of all creatures the variance dissension and hatred of creatures amongst themselues canst thou see all this and either not regard it at all or else take delight in it this is a cursed and abhominable delight if a rich man should consume all his wealth or throw it all on heapes and then desperately set his house on fire hath he any cause of ioy to see this if he sit still at this you will say he is senselesse but if he laugh at it he is madde so god created man rich in all blessings put him into the palace of the world garnished this house of the world with exceeding beauty his meate his apparell his recreation his house were all excellent and glorious he made all other creatures amongst which there was nothing but concord loue agreement vniformity comelinesse and good order now man by sinne fell amp by his fall not onely spent all his riches that is defaced the glory of his owne estate but also set his house that is the world on fire that is defaced the beauty of heauen and earth brought confusion corruption vanity deformity imperfection amp monstrous disorder on all creatures set all the world together by the eares amp one creature at variance and deadly hate with other so that one creature doth fight teare wound destroy and eate vp another o cursed amp damnable sinne of man that hath so shamefully disordered that heauenly order wherein god created all things at the beginning and miserable man are we which can sit still amp see this and not be moued but if we reioyce and delight in it certainly then a spirituall madnesse hath bewitched our soules let vs therefore stirre vp our selues and looke about vs and seeing all the world on a fire about vs namely flaming in contention hatred and all disorder let vs for our parts seeke to quench it which because wee cannot therefore lament and bewaile it but much more lament and be humbled for our sinne which kindled this fire of disorder in the world hitherto of the manner of the creation the third point is by what means the text answereth the world was ordained in that excellent order by the word of god by this word is meant not any vocall word as if the lord should speake vnto the creatures nor secondly the substantiall word of the father the second person although i confesse that by him were made all things yet i take it it is not so meant in this place but rather as moses doth gen when he saith that in the creation god said it is in both places a comparison taken from a prince who bids his servant doe this and they doe it presently the lord in this place is like a prince he hath his word whereby he commaunded the world to be made that word i take it is his will for god willing of any thing is an effectuall commaunding of it to be done yes it is the doing of it for his willing of a thing to be is more then all the commaundements of all man in the world for if he doe but will it the thing is done what euer it be whereas all the world may commaund and yet it is no neerer from hence i take it this is manifest to be the surest sense for this place god willed the being of all creatures and according as he willed they presently were and that his will was his word here mentioned here then first marke a speciall point that sets out the glorie of this creator hee vsed no labour no motion no paines no servant no instrument no meanes as man do he onely spake the word and they were made he commanded and they were created psalm this shewes how glorious a god he is and his power how omnipotent it is who at his owne will and word produced such a glorious frame of heauen and earth so many sorts and kinds of creatures in their order and due place dauid most seriously considered of this when hee made the psalme as appeareth if we reade it wee ought also so deepely to meditate of this his glorious power manifested in this miraculous creation as that we seeing it may acknowledge with the psalmist psalm our god sitteth in heauen and doth whatsoeuer he will did the lord make all things by his word learne wee then for our instruction thus much euer when we see what is god will concerning our selues in any crosse or affliction whatsoeuer let vs subiect our selues to it and beare it because it comes from so mighty a god as whom there is no resisting for see he that commaunded all the world to be and it presently was so and nothing could disobay then if he commaund any crosse to seise vpon thee wilt thou resist him nay rather take saint peters holy counsell pet humble thy selfe vnder this so mighty hand of god that he may exalt thee in due time if thou then see his crosse comming towards thee meete it receiue it with both hands beare it with both shoulders if he will humble thee resist not thou for when againe he pleaseth to exalt thee all the diuels in hell are not able to resist him it followeth so that the things which we see are not made of things which did appeare the fourth amp last point is the matter whereof the world was made the text saith the things that we see that is all the world were made of things neuer seene that is of a flat nothing which here is said not to be seene or not to appeare because how can that appeare or be seene which is not so the meaning is when there was nothing in the world then god made the world to be this is the strangest thing of all in this fourth effect for it is not so strange that the world should be created in excellent order or that god should make it by his word as that hee should make it of nothing reason denies it phylosophie disputes against it as absurd and neuer will yeeld vnto it but here is the power of faith manifest for it makes vs beleeue and know it is so hence we learne if he created the world and vs of nothing then he can preserue vs also by nothing that is without meanes or by weake meanes or contrary to meanes he that did the one can do the other for the same reason is of both this is a speciall point of our religion not to tye god prouidence vnto meanes man vse neuer to acknowledge it but with meanes but that is no worke of faith but wee ought not onely to see god prouidence when we see no meanes but euen when other meanes are against vs then to see it is a point of faith and that is our duty though it be hard giue man health wealth liberty peace let them be guarded about with god blessings then they will magnifie the prouidence of god but take these away and lay vpon them penurie sicknesse or any crosse then they rage and raile and distrust yes blaspheme and say no prouidence no god and thus god is beholden to the meanes for else man would flatly deny him but this argues the want of faith for had we that faith in vs whereby we beleeued stedfastly that god made all the world without meanes that faith would also perswade vs that he can preserue vs being made though meanes be wanting or though they be against vs this we may make vse of whether wee be in necessitie and would be relieued or in any perill and would be succoured or in what extremitie soeuer when meanes doe faile vs secondly if he made all things of nothing then he is able also in respect of his promises made in christ to call such things that are not as though they were rom as a man by nature is the childe of wrath and of the diuell he is able to make him a servant of god and childe of grace this may teach vs not to despaire of any mans saluation though hee seeme almost past all grace for god can make any thing of nothing and therefore can put grace into that heart wherein afore was none and this is a comfort to all them which through weaknesse of faith cannot perswade themselues of their election for suppose thou be full of wants and imperfections amp hast a rebellious and froward heart what then remember god made thee once a creature of nothing hee can now againe make thee a new creature of nothing he created thee without meanes he can saue thee though neuer so many meanes doe seeme to be against thee and thus much of these three effects of faith and consequently of the first part of this chapter containing a description of faith in generall by faith abell offred vnto god a greater sacrifice then cain by which he obtayned witnesse that he was righteous god testifying of his gifts by which faith hee also being dead yet speaketh the second part of the chapter containeth an illustration and proofe of the former description by a rehearsall of the most excellent patternes and exsamples of faith which flourished in the church of the old testament these exsamples be of two sorts such as are set downe seuerally one by one from the verse to the such as are set downe ioyntly many together from thence to the end the exsamples set down seuerally are of two sorts such as were naturall israelites and borne members of the church visible such as were not naturally members but strangers from the church of god till they were called extraordinarily exsamples of such as were members of y e visible church are also of sorts such as liued about the flood or after the flood first of such as liued afore or about the time of the flood there bee three faithfull man whose faith is here recorded abell before amp enoch before noe both before amp after all these three in order these excellent amp most worthy exsamples are all grounded on some place of the old testament and are continued from the beginning of the world almost to christs incarnation for he beginneth with abell which is so neere the beginning that he was the second good man that liued in the world yes and the first of all that had this true faith as the onely meanes of his saluation for as for adam he afore his fall had not this faith neither should it haue saued him but when the first meanes failed him then came this faith as the second and more effectuall meanes of his saluation but abell was neuer in possibility to be saued by any thing but by this faith and therefore abels faith hath the first place of commendation and that in this verse abels faith is here commended for three things in that hee offred by it a greater sacrifice then cain by it he obtained testimonie with god by it dead abell yet speaketh the effect of abels faith is thus set down by the h ghost by faith abel offred vnto god a greater sacrifice then cain the ordinary exposition of those words is this that cain and abell comming to offer there was no difference in the matter of their sacrifice but onely in the manner of offring in that abell offred by faith and so did not cain this exposition though it be good yet it fits not the scope of this place nor the fourth of gen the right sense therefore seemes to be this abell hauing faith this faith moued him to testifie his thankfull heart to god this hee did by offring vnto god the best and costliest sacrifice that he could namely the first fruites and fattest of his sheepe whereas vnbeleeuing cain hauing no loue to testifie vnto god brought onely of the fruite of his ground not of the best as abel did but whatsoeuer cam first to hand this being the true meaning of the whole let vs come to the particular points laid down in this effect and they are three the first point containes their seruice in generall the second their seruice in particular the third the difference of their seruice wherein especially will appeare the excellencie of abels faith first abell and cain the two first brother in the world offered sacrifice to the true god how learned they this for they had no scripture it was penned many yeeres after namely by moses first of all i answer when their parents adam and eue had fallen god gaue them of his infinite goodnesse a couenant of grace that the seede of the woman should breake the serpents head genes wee doubt not but our first parents receiued this couenant and beleeued the promise and this their faith taught them how to worship the true god aright you wil say thus adam amp eue learned of god but how came this to cain amp abell i answer when they had beene thus instructed of god adam as a faithfull servant of god taught the same religion and deliuered the same doctrine to his children and by it they were taught what to whom and in what manner to offer sacrifice and thus they did it neither by scripture nor reuelation nor their own inuention but by the instruction of their parents hence let all parents learne a lesson of adam the first parent that was in the world namely to procure the good of their children he nourtered his children excellently he prouided for them til they came to age then he left them not but appointed them their callings for one was a husbandman and the other a shepheard not thus onely but he taught them to worship the true god both in their callings amp in the practice of religion and therefore he taught them to offer sacrifice in way of thankfulnesse vnto god all this did adam so must thou do with the children which god hath giuen thee prouide for them carefully till they be of age take eed they miscarie not any way for want of things needfull so bring them vp as that they may be apt to liue in some godly calling whereby to serue god and to doe good in his church and that calling thou must appoint him according to the fitnesse of his gifts adam appointed them not both one calling but diverse callings according to the diuersity of their gifts and thou must see it be a lawful and honest calling for so are both these then the greatest matter of all these teach them religion and the true manner of fearing amp worshipping god that as by the two first thy child may liue well in this world so by this he may be made an heire of the kingdome of heauen adam was the first father amp father of vs all let all then follow him in this practice amp if we follow him in one follow him in both diverse wil be as careful for their body amp for their callings as adam was but how few are as carefull to teach them religion for the prefermet of their soules to life eternall but parents must haue care of both these else they shal answer for their child at the day of iudgemet amp though he perish in his own sin yet his bloud wil god require at the fathers hands for god made him a father in his room and he discharged not the duty of a father vnto their child secondly in that cain offered as well as abell hence we learne diverse instructions it is a common opinion that if a man walke duly and truly in his calling doing no man harme but giuing euery man his owne and so doe all his life long god will receiue him and saue his soule but the truth is this if man do thus it is good and commendable and they must be exhorted to continue but if they stand vpon this for saluation they cast away their soules for mark here cain was a man that walkt in an honest calling and more then that he tooke paines amp laboured in it which all man doe not which haue honest callings and more then all these when abell offred hee came and worshipped god also and hee did outwardly in such sort as no man could blame him but onely god that saw his heart and for all this yet is he a wicked cain and that is all that the word of god giues him john then it is manifest that to walke in a mans calling iustly and vprightly doing no man harme wil not serue the turne cain did it and yet was cursed wee must then goe further then cain else wee shall goe with cain to the place where he is reason not with thy selfe i worke hard and follow my calling i hurt no man thus could cain reason and yet but cursed cain thou must then beside these get that that cain did not learne in thy conscience to see and feele thy sinne to be grieued for it so as thou maist say my sicknesse my pouerty my crosses grieue me but nothing so much as my owne sinnes these trouble me aboue all amp this griefe swalloweth vp all the rest and there is another thing which i seeke aboue all not gold siluer or promotion but reconciliation with my god and his fauour in iesus christ if thou hast these two then thou goest beyond cain then shalt thou stand before god with abell and be accepted remember these two humiliation for sinne and desire of reconciliation these two is the summe of religion if thou hast these thou article blessed with abell if not cursed with cain howsoeuer thou liuest in the world if thou say cain killd his brother and so would not i doe for all the world i will do no man hurt in body or goods this will not serue for it is said that god had no respect to cain afore he killd his brother euen when he offred his sacrifice and therefore this duty is most necessary and there is no shifting it off cain offred as well as abell yes cain offred afore abell as it is manifest in genesis and yet abels sacrifice was better when it came to the proofe and was accepted amp not cains which came first hence we learn that a man may be more forward then many other in many outward duties of religion and yet not be accepted of god another may be not so forward to the duty and yet when hee comes be better accepted whence comes this what is forwardnesse in good duties a fault nothing lesse but hence it is he that outwardly is most forward may come in hypocrisie amp without faith the want whereof makes his forwardnesse nothing worth many such haue we in our church great frequenters of places and exercises of religion and yet they come but as cain did or it may be in worse intents thy forwardnesse is to be commended but take this with thee also care not so much to be first at the sermo or to be there oftner the other as to goe with true faith repentance amp a heart hung ing for grace if not boast not in thy forwardnes cain offred afore abell amp yet not accepted amp so there may com an abell after thee amp bring faith with him amp be accepted whe thou with thy hypocriticall forwardnes shalt be reiected as cain was thirdly did cain offer as wel as abel hence we learn that the church militant is a mixt amp copounded copany of man not of one sort but true beleeuers amp hypocrites mingled together as here in the very infancy of the church here was a cain worshipping in shew as wel as abell that worshipped in truth so was it in the infancy so in her perpetual growth amp so shal it be in the last age of the church the good shal neuer be quite separated fro the bad vntil christ himself do it at the last iudgement goates shall alwaies be mingled amongst the sheepe till christ the great shepheard do separate them himselfe math and he that imagineth a perfect separation till then imagineth a fancy in his braine and such a church as cannot be found vpon the earth this being so let no man therfore be afraid to ioyne himself to the visible church neither let any that are in it go out of it because the bad are mingled with the good for so it hath been alwaies amp euer wil be he then that wil go out of a church because there be hypocrites in it must go out of the world for such a church is not foud but triuphant in heaue fourthly that cain amp abel offred hence we learne that the church of god which truly professeth his name hath been euer since the beginning of the world for this church was in the houshold of ada whe there was no more but it in the world for sacrifice to god is a sign of the church yes amp beside the sacrifice they had a place appointed where adam amp his family came together to worship god for so much cain intimateth gen amp cain went out from the presence of the lord that is not onely out of his fauour amp protection but from the place of his solemne seruice amp where he wonted to manifest his special presence to his childre seruing him and therfore cain as being excomunicate complaines verse because he must leaue it thus the church hath been fro the beginning amp therfore is truly calld catholike the papists abuse this place notoriously for whereas the church hath been so antient they argue therfore it is aboue the scripture yes amp that we could not know it to be scripture but by the antient testimonie of the church we must know the scripture is two wayes to be considered as it was written amp penned by holy man and so it is later then the church for moses was the first penman of scripture but secondly as it is the word of god the substance sense and truth therof is much more antient the the church yes without the word of god there can be no church for without faith is no church because the church is a copany of beleeuers and without the word it is no faith therfore no word no faith no faith no church so then the scripture was afore the church but penned after thus we see that cain and abell offered now secondly what offred they sacrifices sacrifices were vsed in the worship of god for two ends when a sacrifice was offred especially of beast when a man saw the bloud of the beast poured out it put him in mind of his own sins and the desert of them amp taught him to say thus eue as this creature is here slain amp his bloud distils amp drops away so my sins deserue that my bloud should be s ed and my soule be drenched in hell for euer this creature can die but one death for it sinneth not but my sins deserue both the and death secondly sacrifices serued to put the in minde of the messias to come and the slaying of the beast shewed them how the messias should shed his bloud amp giue his life for the ir s of the people these are the principal ends of sacrifices amp for these ends did cain amp abel offer cain in hypocrisie and for fashion sake abell in truth conscience and sinceritie as it was in the old sacrifices so is it in our sacraments of the new testament whereof the sacrifices were all types in baptisme sprinkling of the water serues to shewe vs how filthily we are defiled with our owne sinnes it signifies the sprinkling of the bloud of christ vpon the heart of a sinner for his sanctification from sinne in the supper the breaking of the bread signifies how we should be broken in humiliation for our sinne and the pouring out of the wine how our bloud and life should be shed and poured out for our sinnes if wee had that that we deserue and secondly they represent vnto vs how the body of christ was broken amp his bloud poured out for our sinnes which he was content to suffer vnder the wrath of his father for our sakes so that we see both the sacrifices and sacraments of the old as also of the new testament all aymed at these two ends to shew vs our sinnes and our miserie by sinne and to foretell or represent our reconciliation by christ which being so our lesson is this wee haue all receiued those two sacraments the first once the second often now if they haue beene duly receiued of vs they ought to haue this double vse vnto vs to cause vs to make a search of our owne sinnes and of our miserie by sinne and seeing it to be cast downe and humbled considering how corrupt our hearts are and how wicked our liues and secondly when this is so then to make vs seek for reconciliation with god by faith in christ to make vs desire it loue it and pray for it aboue all things in the world abell not onely offred but offred so as that it put him n minde of his sin and of his redemption by the death of the messias to come so wee must not onely outwardly receiue the sacraments but so receiue as that wee may see and be humbled for our sinne and seeke to be reconciled to god in christ such vse also ought we to make of hearing the word and not to be content with bare hearing of it or to get a generall knowledge out of it but it must giue vs a speciall sight of our owne estate by sinne and vrge vs forward to seeke the fauour of god in christ religion stands not in hearing the word and receiuing the sacraments with the congregation though it be done neuer so often and neuer so formally but so to heare and so to receiue as that they may worke in vs those two things and that is the pith and life of religion and whosoeuer he be that professeth religion and sheweth not the fruit of it in these two that mans profession is in vaine and it wil go for no payment at the day of iudgement thus we see they offred and what they offred it followeth a greater sacrifice then cain the third amp last point is the difference of these sacrifices for although cain offred as well as abell and offred sacrifice as well as abell yet was there a difference in their sacrifices for abels was better then cains this is the chiefe point for this sets downe what was that excellency of his faith for which he is here commended abell is not commended for offring by his faith for so did cain that had no faith nor for offring sacrifice by his faith for so did cain that had no faith but because that by his faith he offred a better sacrifice then cain could the holy ghost calls abels a better or greater sacrifice because abell brought the best and fattest of his sheepe and so bestowed the most cost hee could as signifying that hee would haue bestowed more cost had hee knowne how to haue done it for he that giues as he hath would giue more if he had it and he that doth the best he can in any thing it is certaine hee would doe better if he could cain contrariwise brought not the best of his fruites but either the worst or whatsoeuer came first to hand as thinking that whatsoeuer hee brought was good enough therefore worthily is abell saide to haue offred a better sacrifice then cain and further this holy practice of abell came to be a law written euen one of the commaundements of the ceremoniall law namely that the first borne should be offred to god exod and the first fruites of the corne leuit ampc and that nothing that was lame blind maymed or had any blemish in it should be offred to the lord deut abell here did euen that which these lawes commaunded and these lawes commaunded the same that he did thus god vouchsafed to honour his servant abell for his obedient and honest heart euen to make his practice the ground and beginning of one of his owne lawes that so the israelites in all their generations might in their daily practices remember this worthy deede of holy abell to his perpetuall honour now for vs the truth is this law bindes vs not for it was a ceremonie and is ended in christ yet the equity and vse of it reacheth euen to vs namely it teacheth vs when we will giue any thing vnto god to giue the best we haue this is the equity of all those lawes ceremoniall which commaunded them to giue to the lord their first borne and their first fruites and the fattest of their cattell and so much of them do still binde vs now from this rule are taught diverse duties to the parent hast thou many children and wilt giue some to the lord namely to serue him in the ministerie the practice of the world is to make the eldest a gentleman the next a lawyer the next a merchant hee that is youngest or least regarded or that hath some infirmity in wit or deformity in body set him to schoole let him be a minister but abels sacrifice controlles this profane course of the world learne therefore by him whomsoeuer of all thy children thou findest fittest in gifts and graces of body and minde whom thou louest best and most esteemest he is fittest for the lord and the lord is most worthy of him consecrate him to the lord for his seruice in the ministerie to the young man he being in the strength and ripenesse of wit senses memory capacity and in the best of his age he saith i will take my pleasure now i am fittest for it i will repent at the end of my dayes and that is a fitter time this is a vile policie of the diuell to dishonour god and to cast away their soules what a griefe is it to giue the diuell his young yeares the strength of his body and wit and to bring his withered old age vnto god nay be sure god will not accept thy rotten sacrifice of old age but rather giue thee vp to the diuell that hee may haue thee altogether which hath had the best then follow rather salomons counsell ecclesiastes who bids thee remember thy creator in the dayes of thy youth remember abels sacrifice it was of the best so thou hast no sacrifice but thy selfe to offer offer then the best thy young yeares is the best time giue them vnto god to all christians abell offred the best it teacheth vs all if wee will professe and serue god not to doe it by the halfes or for shew and fashion sake or negligently as not caring how thus to do is but to offer the sacrifice of cain and that makes the most professors goe away with their seruice vnaccepted as cains was for god will haue all or none he is worthy to haue no partner hee must be serued with all the heart with soule and body so that a man must consecrate himselfe wholly vnto him kings it is the speciall commendation of good king iosias that hee turned vnto the lord with all his heart and soule and might and for that hee is preferred afore all kings afore or after him not that iosias could fulfill the lawe perfectly as it required but it is meant of the endeuour of his heart and life by which he straue with all his might to serue god as well as he could his exsample is ours we professe religion wee must looke that our hearts affect it we professe a turning from sinne we must take heed it be not formall and from the lips but from the heart so when we practice any duty of religion whether we pray or heare the word or receiue the sacrament this is the sacrifice that we can offer we must not doe them coldly and carelesly but with zealous affection and resolution from the heart otherwise if we serue god for fashion sake and our hearts are on the world and our owne lusts wee offer the sacrifice of cursed cain and we with our formall religion shall goe to him but let vs offer the sacrifice of abell that is though it be neuer so little yet let it be the best wee can and all we can and god will accept vs as he did abell and thus the parent should giue god his best childe the young man his best yeares euery man his best part which is his heart and thus we follow the steps of holy abell who offred to god the best sacrifice he had this was the fruite of his faith euen so that parent that young man that professor that hath true faith will do so likewise hitherto of the first effect of abels faith it followeth by the which he obtained witnesse that he was righteous this is the second effect of abels faith wherby it is commended for the meaning by faith hee meanes sauing faith which makes a man iust before god and no other for whereas he had said afore that by faith our elders had obtained a good report he proues that general by this exsample of abell therefore that sauing faith which was meant there is also meant here these wordes set downe two benefits which abell had by his sauing faith first he was iust by it secondly god testified that he was so for the first abels faith made him iust and righteous not because his faith was an excellent quality of that vertue in it selfe as to make him iust but because it was an instrument whereby he apprehended and applied to himselfe the righteousnesse of the messias to come whereby hee might stand iust before god this was his righteousnesse which he had by faith for hee trusted not to any holinesse of his owne though it is out of question hee knew he was the son of that man who once was perfectly righteous but the trust and confidence of his heart was in the righteousnesse of that blessed seed which god had promised should breake the serpents head this promise he knowing beleeued it applied it to himselfe and this faith made him righteous here we learne a worthy lesson of christianity namely that the true and the vndoubted way to heauen is a holy and liuely faith in iesus christ for this faith makes a man righteous amp that righteousnesse opens him the gate of heauen to this end saith the apostle being iustified by faith we haue peace with god but by who through our lord iesus christ for the vse of this doctrine we must renue our former exhortation which indeed cannot be too often presled to the conscience there is none of vs so vile none so profane but we desire saluation if we do then we must tread the beaten way to it for we are not borne heires of it neither can we come thither by chaunce but there is a way that must be taken amp that way is but one all other are misleading by waies again that way must be taken in this life else it is too late now this way is to be a iust amp righteous man with this neuer man failed and without this neuer man attained to saluation for no vncleane thing can come into the kingdome of heauen neuer was man iustified there which was not iust before and that must be here begun which in heauen is to be perfected in this life therefore wee must seeke to be iust now our owne good workes will not serue to make vs iust for they are all vnable to indure the trial of god iustice and if we stand to them and they proue not able to satisfie god iustice then in stead of sauing vs they will condemne vs therefore with abell let vs go out of our selues deny our selues and cleaue onely to christs righteousnes in life amp death this is the way that neuer will deceiue vs but some wil say we walke in this way i answer he that walketh in a way may be traced by his steps so then shew your steps of holinesse of deuotio of charity ampc these must shew your faith leaue these steps behinde you and then your faith is good thus did holy abell beleeue thou it acknowledge it and follow thou after him and renounce all by paths which the papists or thy own braine imagineth let this one doctrine sinke into thy heart in steade of many and let not the diuell strake it out for if thou walke in this way my soule for thine it will bring thee to heauen if not at the last day this doctrine will condemne thee because it shewed thee this way and thou wouldest not walke in it secondly obserue he saith abell was approued and accepted of god how proues hee that because his workes pleased god as who say his workes cannot please god vnlesse his person do therfore in that his works do thence he concludeth that his person did it is the reason of the holy ghost and therefore infallible in the framing of this reason the holy ghost teacheth vs a great point of our religion namely that first a mans person must please god afore his actions can and after the person then the actions this is plaine in these words for it is said he first obtained witnesse that hee was righteous himselfe and then god testified of his gifts so likewise more plainely genesis god had respect first to abell and then to his offring so that the truth is manifest no worke pleaseth god afore the worker do this being so hath excellent vses first it ouerthroweth a maine pillar of roman religion iustification by workes for how can a man be iustified by his workes when hee himselfe must be iust afore the works can be vnlesse hee be iust his workes be wicked if they be wicked afore his person be iust how can they then iustifie him and if the person bee once iust what needes it then to be again iustified by works good works make not a man good but a good man makes a worke good amp shall that work that a man made good return againe amp make the man good that is absurd in reason and it is needlesse for the man is good alreadie else the worke could not haue beene good wee may therefore say workes are rather iustified by the person of a man then his person by the works and it is a most vaine thing to looke for iustification from that which thou thy selfe must first iustifie afore it be iust if wee had no other reasons against iustification by workes but this this were sufficient secondly hence we learne that till a man bee called and his person iustified and sanctified all that euer hee doth is sinne his common actions his eating drink sleeping walking talking are all sinnes yes the workes of his calling amp his labor in the same though neuer so iust equal and vpright further his ciuill actions namely the practice of ciuill vertues his outward grauitie meekenesse sobrietie temperance quietnesse vprightnesse and all outward conformitie are all sinnes yes more then all this his best actions namely his practicing of the parts of god worship or his deeds of charitie his praier his hearing the word his receiuing the sacraments his giuing of almes they are all sinnes vnto him if hee haue not a belieuing and penitent heart yes such sinnes as shall condemne h m if hee had no other obiect this should seeme strange diuinity that the most holy actions as praier ampc should be damnable sinnes i answer they are in themselues holy and good and as farre forth as god hath commanded them yet in the doer they are sinnes because hee doth them from a fowle amp vnholy heart for the same action may be holy in it selfe and in regard of god the author of it and yet a sin in him that is the doer of it as cleere water pure in the fountaine is corrupted or poisoned by running through a filthy and polluted channell so are euen the best actions sinnes as euen the preaching of the word to a minister whose heart is not cleansed by faith and his person accepted of god it is a sin vnto him and if he repent not shall be his condemnation cain sinned not onely in hating and murthering his brother in lying and dissembling with god but cain sinned also euen in offer sacrifice and abels sacrifice had beene a damnable sinne but that his person was iustified before god and the reason of all this is good for nothing in the worke is able to make an action acceptable to god but onely the acceptation of the person by christ this being so it stands vs euery one in hand to looke to our selues and to labour aboue all things for faith and repentance that so our persons may be accepted righteous before god and thereby our actions accepted also if it be a miserable thing that all thy actions euen holy actions should be sinnes then labour to be iustified for that onely can make thy workes accepted if not then though thou labour neuer so much to be approued in the world amp set neuer so glorious a shew vpon thy workes to the eyes of man they are all abhominable sinnes in the sight of god and at the day of iudgement they shall goe for no better preach and teach all thy life long nay giue thy life to die for religion giue all thy goods to the poore depriue thy flesh of all delights build churches colledges bridges high wayes ampc and there may come a poore shepheard and for his keeping of his sheepe be accepted when thou with all this pompe of outward holinesse maist be reiected and why this only because he had faith amp thou hast none his person was iustified before god and thine is not therefore let this be my counsell from abell labour not so much to worke glorious workes as that which thou doest doe it in faith faith makes the meanest worke accepted and want of faith makes the most glorious worke reiected for so faith the text abell must be accepted else his sacrifice is not thus wee see abell was iust and god so accounted him the second point is that god gaue testimonie hee was so in these words what testimonie it was that god gaue of abell and his gift it is not expressed in the word and so it is not certaine but it is very likely that whe he amp cain offred god in speciall mercy sent fire from heauen and burnt vp abels sacrifice but not cains for so it pleased the lord often afterward when he would shew that he accepted any man or his worke he answered them by fire from heauen so he burnt vp the first sacrifice that aaron offred leuit so he answered salomon chronicle and so elijah kings and so it is likely that he gaue this testimonie that he accepted abell and his offring this was a great prerogatiue that abell and the fathers in the old testament had we haue not this but wee haue a greater for wee haue that that is the substance and truth and body of this for wee haue also the fire of god that is his spirit comes downe into our hearts euery day not visibly but spiritually and burnes vp in the heart of a beleeuer his sinnes and corruptions and lights the light of true faith that shall neuer be put out the vse hereof is this as no sacrifice in the old law pleased god but such as was burnt by fire from heauen sent downe either then or afore so our sacrifices of the new testament that is our inuocation of god name our sacrifice of praise our duties of religion our workes of mercy and loue neuer please god vnlesse they proceede from a heart purged by the fire of god spirit that is from a beleeuing and repentant heart both which are kindled and lighted and daily continued by that fire of god spirit therefore it is that paul saith tim that loue must come out of a pure heart and good conscience and faith vnfained the duties of religion and works of loue comming from this purged heart ascend into the presence of god as a smoake of most acceptable sacrifices and are as a sweet perfume in the nosethrils of the lord now of what did god thus testifie of his gift it may here be asked at the first how can abell giue a gift to god hath the lord neede of any thing and are not all things his i answer god is soueraigne lord of heauen and earth and all creatures yet hath hee so giuen his creatures vnto man to vse as that they become mans owne and so he may esteeme amp vse them and being mans a man may in token of his thankfulnes return them again to god especially seeing god accepts them being so offred as most free gifts this sheweth vs first the wonderfull mercy of god that whereas we can offer him nothing but his owne he vouchsafeth to accept a gift offred of his owne euen as though we had of our owne to offer see here a difference between the sacrifices of the old and sacraments of the new testament in their sacrifices they gaue something to god and therefore they are calld gifts in our sacraments we receiue daily grace from god in that the sacrifices of the old law are calld gifts we must know that it is typicall and hath excellent significations vnto vs it signifieth that the messias should be giuen of god freely for the saluation of his elect and that christ the messias should willingly giue himselfe to be a redeemer it signifieth that euery man that lookes for saluation by christ must giue himselfe to god and all that is in him so paul exhorteth rom giue your selues vnto god and your members weapons of righteousnesse when we giue any thing to a man we make him lord of it if we then giue our soules and body to the lord we must giue them so as that they may obay and serue him and be ruled by him and serue for his glory howsoeuer he shall vse them we professe religion and make great shewes but to giue our selues in obedience to god is the life of religion but contrary is the course of the world for most professers are giuen vp to sin and sathan their body giuen to drink gaming vncleannesse iniustice their soules to enuying hatred malice reuenge lust pride selfe loue god hath nothing except it be a face but that will not serue the turne he will haue all body and soule for he made all and he hath redeemed all we go against equity christ gaue his body and soule for vs why should not we giue ours againe to him againe this gift is not as other gifts for here all the profit redounds to the giuer the glory indeede is his but the gaine and profit is our own why then should we withhold our selues from god it argueth we know nor feele not what christ hath giuen vs for if we did if we had liues we would thinke them all too little for him and thus much of the first amp second effect of abels faith the third followeth the effect whereby abels faith is commended is laide downe in these words concerning the meaning whereof there is some difference which is briefely to be examined some thinke the words should be thus translated by which also abell being dead is yet spoke of making the meaning to be that by his faith he obtained a good name to all posterities but it seemes this cannot stand for two causes first because that is already affirmed of abell and all the rest in the second verse that through faith they had obtained a good report which therefore might seeme needlesse so soone to be repeated againe secondly for that afterward christs bloud amp abels being compared together it is not said that christs bloud is better spoken of then abels but that it speaketh better things the abels did therfore the words are rightly traslated now for the true sense of them it is likely the holy ghost here hath relation to the story whence it is taken where vpo cains murder god saith to him the voice of thy brothers bloud crieth to me from the earth and why crieth it namely for vengeance against so monstrous a murder and crieth to all man to behold it and to abhor the like and so after a sort he continueth to speak to this day so that the words in the true amp full sense of them do import these two points that abell spake when he was dead that in a sort abell still speaketh for the first abell spake and cried when he was dead but how not with a vocall speech but the phrase is figuratiue and imports thus much as if the lord had said to cain thou hast killd thy brother closely and it may be hast hid him in the sand or buried him and thinkest no man knoweth of it but thou must know cain this thy fact is as euident to me as if abell had told me i know thou killd him and if thou wonder how i knowe i tell thee his bloud told me for it cried in my eares amp yet it crieth out against thee for though abell be dead his bloud yet speaketh as this is true of abels so of all mens bloud and as of bloud so of all other oppressions though done by neuer so great man murders oppressions and all wrongs done to god children they cry to god against the oppressors though the poore oppressed man dare scarce name them they neede not for their bloud doth yes euen their very teares cannot be shed but god takes them vp and puts them in his bottle and will know who shed them thus bloud crieth against them that shed it yes teares crie against them that cause them this affordeth vs a double instruction first here it is apparant that god seeth and knoweth the sinnes of man though the man be neuer so mighty or their sinnes neuer so secret for though man conuay them neuer so closely and labour to hide them with all the meanes that wit of man can deuise yet the very dead creatures cry out and do proclaime the sinnes and sinners in the eares of god as fully as the voices of liuing man can discouer any thing vnto man priuy oppressions and goods gotten by deepe deceipt lie hid to the world but the stone out of the wall shall crie and the beame out of the timber shall answer it woe be to him that buildeth his house with bloud and erects a citie by iniquitie as though hee had said god knoweth euery stone and euery piece of timber in their stately houses which they haue gotten by deceite or oppressing of the poore priuy conspiracies and plots of treason are laid against princes and magistrates and often in so secret manner as in mans reason is not possible to be discouered but god hath many wayes to finde them out and they neuer scape his priuie search and therefore the holy ghost aduiseth curse not the king no not in thy thought nor the great ones in thy bedchamber for the fowle of the heauen shall carie thy voice and that which hath wings shall declare the matter so that whatsoeuer is plotted neuer so priuily or conspired in the secret closets of vngodly man god knowes it and hath meanes enow to disclose it to the world and in our daily experience god magnifieth himselfe mightily in reuealing murders for bring the murtherer before the dead corps and vsually it bleedeth or giueth some other testimonie whereby it speaketh euen as abels bloud did this is the murtherer nay more for abels bloud spake to god but here euen to man also and of this its hard to giue any reason at all but the secret and immediate hand of god thereby shewing himselfe to know all secret sinnes amp to be able to disclose them by strange meanes the vse of this doctrine is to feare all man from sinning though they thinke it possible to conceale their sinnes from the world for this is one of the strongest and commonest encouragement that man take to liue in a sinne if they thinke it likely to be concealed but here they see how false a ground that is for if they can conceale it from man yet can they not from god and if god know it then can he reueale it to the world when it pleaseth him againe whereas abels bloud cried when he was dead it teacheth vs that god had a care of abell both liuing and dead for it were nothing to say his bloud cried if god heard not that cry but its apparant he heard it for he reuenged it and punished cain when abell was dead and could not reuenge it himselfe and this care god hath not ouer abell alone but ouer all his children and as the psalmist saith pretious in the sight of the lord is the death of his saints that which is vile and of no regard in the world is pretious with god tyrants make hauocke of the church and kill them vp by heapes but god records vp euery one and will not faile to reuenge it when they are dead for if god haue bottles for the teares of his servant surely much more hath he bottles for their bloud the vse whereof is to teach vs in all extremities of danger or distresse to learne patience yes though we be sure to die yet as christ saith to possesse our soules with patience for we haue one wil heare the cause and reuenge our quarrell when we are gone so that if wee be patient wee loose nothing but if wee be impatient wee get nothing let vs therefore hold our tongues for the wrong done to vs crieth loude enough to god for reuenge who will heare it as assuredly as he did abels and thus wee see how abell spake then euen after he was dead the second point is hee speakes also yet and that three wayes first his faith yet speaketh because it admonisheth all man euery where who either heare or reade this story to become such as abell was namely true worshippers of the true god for in abels example it prouokes all man to be like him because it assureth them of the same regard and reward with god that abell had and so abels faith is a neuer dying preacher to all ages of the church here wee learne that the holy examples of god children are reall teaching and loude preaching to other man for there is a double teaching namely in word or deede it belongs to the minister to teach in word and to all man to teach by their deedes and good examples and if the minister teach not thus also it is the worse both for him and his hearers it sufficeth not for him to teach by vocall sermons that is by good doctrine but withall by reall sermons that is by good life his faith his zeale his patience his mercy and all other his vertues must speake and cry amp call to other man to be like vnto him which if he practice carefully in his life as abell did then shall his vertues speake for him to all posterities when he is dead againe abell though dead may be said to speake because howsoeuer his body be dead yet in soule and spirit hee liueth with god in heauen and thus the word speaketh may be vnderstoode because it is here opposed to death by which he being dead yet speaketh that is being dead in body yet liueth in soule which life with god was obtained vnto by his true and sauing faith thirdly hee may be said to speake yet as all other god martyrs are said to crie in the reuelation from vnder the altar how long lord holy and true doest thou not auenge our bloud on them that dwell on the earth as this is true of all martyrs so specially of abell the first martyr of all which words are not spoken neither by him nor them vocally with vttrance of voice but it is so said to signifie what feruent desire the servant of god haue in heauen of the full manifestation of god glory in their body and of an vtter abolishment of sinne in the whole world which their desire they doubtlesse vtter to god in a more excellent manner then in this world wee can vtter any thing with our voice and thus abell speakes yet and shall speake till the worlds end hitherto of the first example the example of abell the second example of faith is taken also out of the old world before the floud and it is of henoch the seauenth from adam to whom strange and miraculous things befell by reason of his faith let the meaning of the words be first examined that is by his confidence in the messias or his sauing faith he was taken away that is from earth to heauen not by an ordinary worke but miraculously as is euident by the next words that he should not see death that is that he should not feele death nor any dissolution of soule and body and therefore his taking away was miraculous for to be taken away by death is an ordinarie worke but to be taken away and yet not die that is miraculous and extraordinary and such was henochs so then the substance of these words is thus much henoch hauing this grace from god to beleeue stedfastly in the messias to come was likewise honoured with this high prerogatiue to be taken into heauen without tasting of death amp further was taken away to the end that he might not die thus we haue the meaning now concerning this translation of henochs there are two opinions some thinke hee was translated in soule onely and not in body and they say he died in the translation so as his soule onely was taken vp into heauen and his body slept in the earth though this appeares false at the first sight yet let vs see their reasons and what they can say for themselues their first reason is this no mortall body vnglorified can enter into heauen but there is no mention of his glorification therefore his body could not come in heauen answer it is certaine it was glorified ere it came in heauen if they reply it is not mentioned i answere it followeth not that therefore it was not for euery circumstance of euery action is not mentioned for many circumstances of actions must necessarily be supposed amp such a one was this againe the glorification of his body is here plainly enough implied where it is said he was translated that he should not see death now if his body sawe not death it was made immortall which is a speciall part of glorification their second reason christ was the first that euer entred into heauen both in body and soule and for proofe thereof they bring s paul where he saith christ is the first fruits of them that sleepe answer true indeede of them that sleepe that is of all that die for christ entred into heauen both in body amp soule first of all them but henoch neuer died as the text here auoucheth therefore that place hinders not but henoch might be in heauen in his body before christs humane flesh ascended thither thirdly they argue out of saint john no man hath ascended into heauen but he that descended the son of man which is in heauen but say they this son of man is not henoch but christ therefore none but christ ascended bodily into heauen answer that place is not meant of corporall ascending but of vnderstanding mysticall and heauenly things no man ascendeth to the full knowledge of heauenly misteries but christ alone who descended from heauen from the bosome of his father and thus we see this opinion hath no strength of argument to rest vpon but wee may safely hold notwithstanding any thing that can be said against it that henoch was translated both in body and soule and if any man yet doubt how he could be take vp in body before he was glorified wee are to know though he died not yet his body was changed as those man shall be which shall be found aliue at the last day the second opinion is that henoch was taken vp in soule and body into paradise some say the heauenly but the most the earthly paradise and there liues in his mortall and corruptible body and must afore the last day come againe in his body with elijah and fight against antichrist and when by their doctrine they haue ouercome him hee shall by violence kill them and so they shall die martyrs and this is the generall receiued opinion of the most papists but it is a meere conceit and a dreame and there is no ground for it but good argument against it for first as for the earthly paradise it was defaced by the flood nor doe we read that euer man was in it but adam and some of their owne fables tell vs that seth went to the gates of paradise when his father adam was sicke to get some physicke out of paradise for his father but hee could not get in nor doe we finde any mention of it afterwards so that it is likely in all reason that it was defaced by the vniuersall flood and if they meane he was translated into the heauenly paradise i answer thither can no vncleane thing come but a mortall body is vncleane and themselues say hee was taken away in his mortall body and in it shal come againe and die therefore henoch hauing a mortall and vnglorified bodie cannot be in the highest heauens into which nothing can enter which is not glorified and made immortall if they alleadge ecclesiasticus enoch pleased god and was translated into paradise ampc i answer we neede not call in question the authoritie of the booke nor answer that it is not in the canon of faith for the text is corrupted wilfully by some that shewed theselues in the latine too bold with the text both there and elsewhere for in the greeke originall there is no such matter as paradise but the words are these enoch pleased god and was translated for an example of repentance to the generations and thus we see this opinion is euery way erroneous and hath no shadow of reason in it nor for it seeing therefore both these opinions are to bee refused let vs in few words set downe the true and orthodoxall iudgement of the church out of the scriptures in the olde and new testament and it is this that this holy man by god special fauour to him was assumed into heauen both body and soule his soule beeing perfectly sanctified and his body glorified in the instant of his translation and there he remaineth in glory expecting the generall resurrection and the full glorification of all god elect out of this translation of henoch we may learne first that there is a life euerlasting prepared of god for his children wherein they shall liue for euer both in soule amp body for hereof hath god giuen vs most euident testimonies both here in enoch and afterward in elijah elias a iew enoch none enoch in the first world elijah in the second enoch before the flood elijah after enoch vncircumcised elijah circumcised enoch married elijah vnmarried and both were assumed into heauen in soule and body and are there to this day and tarry for vs till the ende of the world assuring vs that our soules liue for euer amp that our body thogh they die shall rise againe to life here therefore wee haue a notable ground for that last but not the least article of our faith where we professe to belieue life euerlasting secondly in this example we learne that god is not tied to the order of nature the order which god established amp set downe concerning all man after adams fall is this dust thou article and to dust shalt thou returne by vertue of this decree all man are to die as sure as they once liue and when that time appointed by god is come all the world cannot saue one man but accordingly die he must but here notwithstanding we see god that tied man to this order is not tied himselfe enoch and elijah are exempted they die not their body neuer turned to dust such is the power of god ouer the order of nature in all naturall actions thirdly whereas the papists holde that all the fathers who died before christ were in limbus a place out of heauen and came not in heauen till christ fetcht them thence and carried them with him at his ascension here wee learne it is most false amp forged for here we see henoch and afterwards elijah were in heauen both in body and soule many hundred yeares before christs incarnation whereby as also by many other euidences that might be brought it is apparant that limbus patrum is nothing but a deuise of that hereticall church of rome hitherto hath the holy ghost auouched the translation of henoch now hee proueth substantially that he was taken away neither was hee found for god had taken him away and for his proofe he first laieth downe his ground then he thereupon frameth his argument consisting of diverse degrees of demonstration the ground is the plaine and euident testimonie of the old testament in genesis where the words are these henoch was not found or not seene for god tooke him away against this ground being the very wordes of the olde testament no man can take exception and heere in a word let vs all marke the high and soueraigne authoritie of god word which euen the holy ghost himselfe vouchsafeth to alledge for the confirmation of his owne words it had beene sufficient that the holy ghost here affirmed enoch to be taken away but we see he proues it out of the old testament so also did the apostles and christ himselfe all their doctrine let this teach all man to giue due reuerence to the holy scriptures let teachers alledge them let hearers receiue them farre aboue all humane testimonies seeing the holy ghost himself vouchsafeth to confirme his owne words by the authority thereof secondly hauing laide this ground the holy ghost frames his argument to proue that henoch was taken away by faith and it consisteth of many degrees of euidence for before he was taken away he was reported of that he had pleased god but without faith it is impossible to please god the degrees of the argument are these god himselfe tooke henoch away before he was taken away he pleased god but without faith no man can please god therefore henoch by faith was taken away the first degree that henoch was taken away and was not found any more in this world hath beene sufficiently spoken of already the second degree is that afore hee was taken away hee pleased god which is not barely affirmed but it is further added that hee was reported of or he receiued testimonie that he pleased god now this report or testimonie is taken out of the storie of genesis where it is affirmed of enoch that hee walked with god which walking with god is an assured testimonie that hee pleased god for as the prophet amos saith can two walke together vnlesse they be agreed therefore in as much as henoch walked with god it is proofe sufficient that hee pleased god and because hee pleased god therefore god tooke him away so that here are two distinct points in this second degree first that henoch pleased god secondly that there is a report or a testimonie giuen of him that hee did please god in the first let vs obserue three speciall points of instruction first in that henoch before hee was taken away pleased god let vs learne that whosoeuer lookes to haue his soule translated into heauen at his death and both body amp soule at the resurrection must before hand in this life learne to please god they must seeke to please god not when the time of the translation is come but before as here it is saide henoch did if any man demaund how shall i please god my answere is this adam pleased god by keeping the lawe but now that is past that power is lost wee must nowe please god by direction from the gospell namely by faith in christ and true repentance together with a holy life which must necessarilie accompanie true faith and repentance thus god is pleased and this must we not deferre till our death but doe it in our liues nor can we looke to be inheritours of the kingdome of glory as now henoch is vnlesse before hand wee be in the kingdome of grace by pleasing god as henoch did it is lamentable to see man not care for saluation til death and then they begin to please god but alas god will not be so pleased they begin to learne how to please god when they haue so long displeased him as there is then feare they can neuer please him but that man liueth and dieth with comfort of whom it may be said as here of henoch before hee was taken away hee pleased god againe whereas hee came not in heauen till hee pleased god this discouers the madnesse of sinfull man who will looke for heauen and yet will leaue no sinne but flat themselues therein but let all impenitent man here take knowledge that they come not in heauen till they please god let them therefore cease pleasing themselues and their corruptions by liuing in sinne and learne to please god by a holy life and further in this point marke how nothing brought henoch to heauen but his pleasing of god hee was rich for hee was one of the greatest on the earth hee was royallie descended for hee was the seauenth from adam in the blessed line hee was learned for hee had the sixe first patriarkes to teach him sixe such tutors as neuer man had and it is likely hee had a comely strong and actiue body but see all these brought him not to heauen no he pleased god and was therefore taken away let this teach vs not to rest in wealth beauty strength honour humane learning nor all these put together without the feare of god for some of them may please thy selfe and some may please other man but god must bee pleased afore thou come in heauen if thou wert as good as henoch therefore vnto all thy outward blessings adde this to please god by faith and repentance then as thy pleasing of man may make thee happy in this world so thy pleasing of god shall translate thee from earth to heauen thus wee see henoch before hee was translated pleased god secondly as hee pleased god and else could not haue beene translated so it is added hee was so reported of or there was such a testimonie of him that proofe or testimonie is here concealed but it is recorded in the storie of genesis where it is said henoch walked with god which as we heard before was an assured testimonie that god was well pleased with him but what is this hee walked with god how can a man e saide to walke with god the meaning is that henoch liued a godly righteous and innocent life in this world or to liue in holinesse and righteousnesse is to walke with god and further his heart was possessed of two perswasions or resolutions which were the inducements drawing him to this holy life first that hee was alwayes in god presence and that god is alwayes readie to dispose of all thinges to his good againe that god did see trie and discerne all his wordes and deedes yes his cogitations and thoughts and the whole course of his life these were the holy resolutions of henoch and these made him lead a holy life this lesson is worth learning and this example worthy to be followed of vs all our dutie is with henoch to walke with god in this life if wee purpose to liue with god in heauen and wee walke with god by leading holy and vnblameable liues in holinesse towards god and righteousnesse towards man but if wee thinke this hard to doe wee must labour to be resolued on these grounds first that god and his prouidence is euer present with vs to dispose of vs alwaies to his glory and of all other things to our good secondly that as wee are in god presence so god seeth vs and all our thoughts words and workes b rgaines and dealings and will iudge them all when these two perswasions possesse our hearts it cannot be but wee shall liue godly and feare to offend god for as a childe is dutifull and obedient in his fathers presence so when a man is perswaded he is in god presence it cannot but make him dutifull when a man is perswaded that god seeth him hee will take heede what he doth and that god heareth him hee will temper his tongue and that god beholdeth all his dealings in the world hee will take heede how hee borroweth lendeth buieth or selleth and what hee doth in all his actions and the very cause of all carelesnesse in these and all other duties in the world is because man are perswaded god seeth them not to vrge vs therefore to this excellent dutie we haue first god commaundement walke before mee and be vpright saith god to abraham and in him to all the children of his faith againe wee haue the examples of god children who are renowned for the obedience of this commaundement henoch here after him abraham and after him dauid who testifieth of himselfe i will walke before god in the land of the liuing thirdly as it is both commaunded by precept and practiced by exsample so the proofe of it is most comfortable to all that practice it for it will make them prosper in all they goe about for as hee that is alwaies in the kings presence and company cannot but bee in his fauour and therefore cannot but succeede well in all his affaires so hee that walkes with god cannot but prosper in whatsoeuer hee sets his heart and hand vnto blessed abraham found this most true when he assured his servant whom he sent to prouide isaac a wife in a long and doubtfull and dangerous iourney the lord before whom i walke will send his angell with thee and prosper thy iourney and euen so may euery child of god say with confidence the lord before whom i walke will send his angell with mee and prosper mee in my proceedings fourthly this walking with god is a good meanes to make a man beare the crosse with patience for if hee be perswaded that god seeth how wrongfully he is persecuted or oppressed and that god prouidence is alwayes present so as no affliction can com vnto him but by his appointment and againe that his prouidence disposeth of all things to his good how can he but receiue with patience that portion of afflictions which god shall lay vpon him for as hee that walkes with the king who dare offer him wrong so he that walkes with god what euill can touch him this is iosephs argument to his brother when they were discomforted and feared he would punish them after their fathers death feare not saith he for am not i vnder god as though he had said doe not i walke in god presence and acknowledge my selfe vnder his power and that god when you thought euill against me disposed it to good where the ground of iosephs reason is that he walking with god his affliction turned to his good lastly this is a meanes to bring a man to make conscience of all sinne in thought word and deede and in all his dealings when he perswades himselfe to walke in the presence of god when ioseph was allured to sinne by his mistresse his answere was how shall i commit this great wickednesse and so sin against god the bridle that restrained him was the feare of that god in whose presence he walked and because hee walked with god he would not walke with her in her wicked way and because he kept a holy company with god therefore he would not keepe her company nor be allured by her temptations so then seeing this way of walking with god is euery way so excellent and so profitable let vs learne it not in iudgement and knowledge onely to be able to talke of it which is soone learned but in conscience and practice as dutifull children doe before their parents so let vs in a heauenly awe amp a child like reuerence walke before god labouring for a true perswasion of his presence and prouidence to be alwayes ouer vs and our whole liues the want hereof is the cause of all sinne and if we doe thus walke with god and so please him as henoch here did then shall wee be sure though not after the same manner that henoch was yet in soule first and afterwards in soule amp body both to be translated into eternall life but if we will not walke this way with henoch in this life let vs neuer looke to liue in heauen with him but assure our selues that as the way of holinesse is the way to glory so the way of wickednesse is the way to eternall perdition and thus much of the second degree these words containe the third degree or the third part of the reason and this degree consists of a generall maxime or canon of diuinitie and the holy ghost first layeth it downe and then because it is one of the waightiest principles in religion he proueth it substantially in the words following in the canon it selfe let vs first examine the meaning and then vnfold the manifold vse of it by faith is meant here the same faith as afore namely true sauing faith in the messias and without this sauing faith it is impossible to please god impossible how not in regard of the absolute infinite and indeterminable power of god which hath no limits but his owne will but in regard of that order of the causes and meanes of saluation set downe by god in his word which is this man by sinne hath displeased god god must be pleased againe else a man cannot be saued he that will please god must please him in christ the mediator else he cannot therefore he that wil please god and be saued must needes beleeue in christ and thus by this order it is impossible we denie not but in regard of god absolute power hee could saue a man without faith as hee can lighten the world without the sun but as if he keepe that order of nature which his owne wisedome hath appointed it is impossible to giue light to the world without the sun so if he keepe that order for saluation which his own iustice hath appointed it is impossible to please god without faith in christ so then the meaning is laide downe and now appeares the strength and force of the holy ghosts argument hee that will be saued and come to heauen must first please god but without faith it is impossible to please god therefore without faith no man can be saued nor come in heauen and by consequent therefore henoch being taken into heauen must needes be taken away by faith now the vse of this canon rightly vnderstood is manifold and of great profit first here wee learne that faith is simply and absolutely necessarie to saluation and most necessary of all other giftes and graces of god whatsoeuer and though many be required yet amongst all holy graces this is the principall and more necessarie in some respects then any other for howsoeuer hope and loue and zeale and many other graces of god are required to make the state of a christian complete and though they all haue their seuerall commendations in the word yet of none of them all is it saide in the whole scripture as it is heere said of faith that without it it is impossible to please god and no meruaile for it is the roote and ground of all other graces and giues them their life and being for therefore doth a man feare god therefore doth he loue god therefore is he zealous for god glory because hee beleeueth that god loueth him in christ the redeemer now then if faith be thus necessary then it followeth that those that liue in ignorance and so haue no sound faith but a foolish presumption are in a miserable case for how euer they may flat themselues with conceites of their deuotions and good meanings and good intents it is faith with which they must please god and nothing can without it it stands them therefore in hand to lay off ignorance and presumption and labour for a sound and sauing faith and that will bring them to the fauour of god and againe as for such as haue receiued grace to beleeue seeing faith is of such necessitie and that they hauing faith must needes haue knowledge they therefore must looke and examine by their knowledge whether their faith be a sound faith or no for herein many that haue knowledge deceiue themselues and thinke they haue true faith when they haue not now if any man would knowe whether his faith be sound and sauing or no it is knowne by this if it purifie the heart for so saith s peter that god by faith did purifie the hearts of the profane and filthy gentiles if then thy faith doe not purifie thy heart and cleanse thy life and cause thee to abound in good workes it is no sound nor sauing faith it is but a generall faith it is but an historicall knowledge and cannot saue the soule hee therefore that vpon examination of his heart and life findeth his faith to be such let him not content himselfe but turne his generall faith into a sauing faith which in this world will purifie his heart and at the last day will saue his soule and this must euery man the rather doe because what knowledge or what other gifts of god soeuer any many hath without faith in christ all are nothing for it is faith that seasoneth them all and makes both them and the person himselfe to please god secondly if it be impossible without faith to please god then here wee see the fond and foolish hypocrisie of the world who will please god by other meanes some thinke if they be glorious in the world either for their wealth or their wit or their honour or their authority or their learning they presently bring themselues into a fooles paradise and because the world makes account of them and they please themselues therefore they thinke it certaine they must needes please god but alas though all the world admire them and they be neuer so farre in loue with themselues he that sits in heauen laugheth them to scorne for not all the pompe and glory nor all the millions and mountaines of gold in the world can please the lord for one of the least of their many thousand sinnes wherewith they haue prouoked him let these man aske nabuchadnezzer if his pompous pride or achitophel if his actiue head and crafty wit or absalom if his golden lockes or iezabell if her painted face and courtly attire or naball if his flockes of sheepe or the philosophers if their naturall learning if all of these or any of these did euer please god nay alas they all haue found and felt that without faith it is impossible to please god thirdly it is the opinion not of the turke alone in his alcaron but of many other as ill that euery man shall be saued by his owne religion if he be deuout therein be hee turke iewe or christian papist or protestant but this is a ground and rule of atheisme and appeares here to be most false for no saluation without pleasing of god and without faith it is impossible to please god therfore no religion can saue a man but that which teacheth a man rightly to beleeue in christ and consequently to please god but euery religion teacheth not to beleeue in christ some not at all and some not aright and therefore it is impossible for such a religion to saue a man againe be a man what hee can be vnlesse he be within the couenant of grace he cannot be saued but hee cannot be within the couenant but by faith therefore no man can bee saued by any meanes but by true faith nor in any religion but that which teacheth true faith here therefore not onely turkes and iewes are excluded but this also sheweth many papists and many carnall gospellers in our church how short they come of that religion which must saue their soules for this is the conceite of the most man that if they doe some good workes which carie a faire shew to the world as liberality to learning or charity to the poore straight they thinke they haue leaue to liue as they list and god is bound to forgiue their sinnes and to giue them heauen and this they imagine though they knowe not what it is to beleeue in christ or to repent of their sinnes one of this religion came to the prophet micha in his dayes and asked him this question vttring that plainely which all such man thinke in their hearts wherewithall shall i come before the lord and bowe my selfe before the high god shall i come before him with thousands of rams and tenne thousand river of oile hee makes the question and would faine make answere himselfe nay hee goeth further and offers more shall i giue my first borne for my transgression and the fruite of my body for the sinne of my soule but the prophet answers him shewing him his follie and how little god regards such workes without a contrite heart hee hath shewed thee o man what is good and what the lord requireth of thee surely to doe iustly to loue mercie to humble thy selfe and walke with thy god marke how that answere fits this example of henoch hee pleased god he walked with god and was taken away so answereth the prophet if thou wouldest please thy god and come to heauen by his fauour neuer stand vpon thousands of rams and river of oile vpon thy gay and glorious workes but humble thy selfe and walke with thy god no walking with god saith micha no pleasing of god what is it but all one as if hee had said without faith it is impossible to please god here then is no disallowance of good workes but of workes without faith and true repentance which though they be neuer so faire and flourishing yet is it impossible that without faith they should please god hereby it is also manifest that all the vertues of the heathen and the workes of such man as either knowe not christ or knowing him acknowledge him not their onely sauiour or acknowledging him doe not truely beleeue in him with such a faith as purifieth their hearts are nothing else but as the fathers called them splendida peccata gilded and glittering drosse and beautifull deformities and how euer this seemes harsh yet it must needes bee true seeing without faith it is impossible to please god and here also the vanity of some popish writers appeares who presumptuously make some philosophers saints whereas they should first haue shewed that they beleeued in christ and then wee would beleeue and teach it as willingly as they but else if they had had all the learning and all the morall vertues in the world this must stand for a truth without faith it is impossible to please god lastly here wee learne that the word of god registred in the holy scriptures doth containe in it sufficient direction for all the actions and duties of a mans life for without faith no man can please god and if no man then no mans actions can please god which are not of faith for whatsoeuer is not of faith is sinne romanes chapter verse if therefore mens actions must proceede from faith then consequently must they haue their ground amp warrant from the word for faith and the word are relatiues and the one dependes vpon the other no faith no word to bind no word no faith to beleeue but all actions that please god must bee done in faith therefore all actions that please god haue some ground and direction in the word of god without which word of god there can be no faith and this is true not onely in holy actions but euen in the common actions of mens liues and lawful callings this is a principle which we must firmely beleeue and receiue and beside this argument here it is also proued by the euident testimonies of the holy ghost s paul to timothie all scripture is giuen by inspiration of god and is profitable to teach improue correct and instruct in righteousnesse that the man of god may be absolute and made perfect vnto all good workes how can the sufficiencie of scripture be more sufficiently in words expressed againe euery creature and ordinance of god is good ampc for it is sanctified by the word of god and prayer now if the scripture make a christian perfect in all good workes how can it be but it giues him sufficient directions for all his workes and if euery action be sanctified by the word how can that be but the word hath warranty and direction for euery action and duty which may fall out in the course of a christian life and vpon these grounds wee haue good reason to be resolued of this truth but now if any man aske how this can be for the scriptures were written long agoe and the stories are of particular man nation and times and the commaundements are knowne to be but tenne how then can the scriptures yeeld sufficient directions for euery mans particular actions i answer the scripture giues directions for all actions wayes either by rules or by examples rules are of two sorts generall or particular particular rules for particular callings are many for kings they must reade god booke and not haue many wiues nor gather too much siluer and gold they must be wise and learned and kisse the son of god christ iesus and many other for ministers they must be apt to teach watching sober not young schollers and many other and so consequently the most of the callings that are in the common wealth haue their particular directions in plaine rules generall rules are first the tenne commaundements which are directions for all sorts and callings of man in all times what to be done what not to be done in all actions towards god and man and besides in the new testament there are some fewe rules which are generall directions for all man in all ages as whatsoeuer you would that man should doe to you doe you the same vnto them againe whether you eate or drinke or whatsoeuer you doe doe all to the glory of god againe let all things be done to edification and without offence of thy brother againe let all your workes be done in loue lastly let no man seeke his owne alone but euery man anothers wealth now there is no action in the world nor any duty to be done of a christian ma be he a publike or priuate person be it a publike or a priuate action be it towards god or man but if he haue not a particular direction yet it falls within the compasse of some of these rules and by the tenour of some of these hee may frame his worke in such manner as shall be pleasing to god and comfortable to himselfe secondly besides rules there are examples which are speciall directions and they are either of god or good man extraordinarie examples of god namely such as hee did in extraordinarie times or vpon extraordinarie occasions they concerne vs not for these hee did by the power and prerogatiue of the godhead as bidding of abraham sacrifice his son bidding the israelites spoile the egyptians and such like but the ordinarie workes of god wisedome in his creatures of his iustice towards sinners of his mercie towards his children of his care and prouidence towards all are excellent rules of direction for vs hence wee haue these rules be ye holy for i am holy be ye mercifull as your father in heauen is mercifull luke so for the actions of christ who was god and man the miraculous actions of his power which argued his god ead as his walking vpon the water and such like are no directions for vs nor againe his actions and workes lone as hee was mediator as his fasting fourtie dayes his passion and his merits these are no directions for vs to do the like but as the first giue vs instruction so these procure vs iustification but the third sort of his actions done by him as a man or as a iew borne they are both our instruction and imitation and they are good directions for our actions as his obedience his zeale his patience his humility and all other vertues concerning all which he saith himselfe to vs learne of me for i am humble and lowely and againe when he had washed his apostles feete he bad them learne of him to loue one another for saith he i haue giuen you example that you should do euen as i haue done to you these his examples are rules of direction to all man in the like case now as for the examples of man as the examples of wicked man are euery way to be eschewed so good mens are to be followed for whatsoeuer is written is written for our learning rom and for them we are to know that their examples or actions contrary to the word are therefore to be auoided because they be contrary as noahs drunkennesse lots incest dauids adultery and many other his infirmities and such like such as are directly agreeable with the word of god are to be embraced and receiued as directions for our liues not for their owne sake but because they are agreeable to the word but as for such as are neither commaunded nor forbidden and being done were neither allowed nor disallowed these being done by godly man and such who for their faith were approued of god and against which no exception can be taken in the word they be as rules and directions for vs in the like cases now there is no action that can fall out in the life of a christian man for which he hath not out of the scripture either a rule generall or particular or else some example to follow which is as good as a rule vnto him and thus wee see how the scripture affoords directions for all our actions in the demonstration whereof we haue stoode the longer because it is a principle of great moment the vse hereof is double first we must therefore in all the actions of our liues and callings take consultation with the word of god and for our direction therein wee must search for either generall or particular rules or at least for examples of godly me in like cases and without the warrant and direction of some of these wee are by no meanes to enter into any thing or to do any work if we doe then we cannot cleare our selues from sinne in so doing for we sinne because we please not god in doing that action we please not god because we haue no faith for the doing of it we haue no faith because we haue no warrant nor ground in the word for it therefore what euer a man presumeth to do without some warrant in the word for his direction he sinneth in so doing secondly ere ministers must learne their duty for if no action can possibly please god that is done without faith nor can be done in faith without warrant from the word then must they be god mouth vnto the people to be able to tell them what is lawful what is unlawful by the word that so their people may performe their actions in faith and consequently please god now hauing laid downe this rule because it is a principle of so great moment the holy ghost in the next words proceedes to the proofe of it for he that commeth to god must beleeue that god is and that he is a rewarder of them that seeke him these words are a proofe of the former rule and the reason stands thus he that commeth to god must needes beleeue but he that pleaseth god commeth to god therefore hee that pleaseth god must needes beleeue and so without faith it is impossible to please god to come to god in the scriptures but especially in this example is to labour to haue fellowship with god in christ as is manifest in three places more in the fourth chapter wee are bid to goe boldly to the throne of grace and in the seauenth christ is said to be able perfectly to saue th m that come vnto god by him and in the tenth we are called to draw neere with a true heart in assurance of faith out of all which places it appeares that to come to god is to haue fellowship with god by christ and the reason why that phrase is so often vsed to the hebrewes is for that many of them hauing receiued the profession of christ afterward forsooke him againe and fell from his religion and by renouncing christ fell away from god therefore hee exhorteth them to take heede least there be in any of them an euill heart and vnfaithfull to depart from the liuing god chap now by the contrary i to renounce christ be to fall or goe away from god then we may gather that to come to god is to cleaue to christ and to god by christ so then the meaning is he that will haue any fellowship with god in christ he must beleeue what must he beleeue two things that god is that he is a rewarder of them that seeke him he must first beleeue that god is that is not so much that there is a god for that wee are taught by the very light of nature but that this god whom in christ he labours to know and come neere is the true and onely god this is a notable point in christian religion to beleeue that god is god indeede not a fiction a shadow or imaginarie god but god indeede for it is the scope of the first commaundement that god gaue mankinde if any man obiect there is no man that knowes god but confesseth god to be god no man was so mad as euer to thinke otherwise i answer to beleeue the true god to be god indeede is a matter of great difficulty for though a man by nature thinke there is a god yet doe we not by nature thinke the true god to be god nay by nature euery man is an atheist and denieth in his heart the true god to be god and doth impugne the first commaundement aboue all other and this may truly and safely be affirmed of all man that euer came of adam christ alone excepted that by nature they are atheists and it may be proued thus by nature though wee know and beleeue there is a god yet the corruption of our nature is such as wee frame and faine him to ourselues to be such a one as we please for we denie in our hearts his power his presence and his iustice but to take away these three from him is to denie the true god to be god indeede first man by nature denie god presence for man would be ashamed to doe many things in the presence of any man euen the basest in the world which when they are out of mens sights and yet in god presence they commit carelesly and boldly i speake not of naturall actions which are lawful amp yet in many wherof there is none so great shame as man naturally refuse to doe them before others but i meane sinfull actions which not for any naturall vnseemelinesse but euen for their foulenesse and vglinesse because they are haynous sinnes man would feare to doe if any man were present seeing then man feare not nor shame not to doe them though they be in god presence it followeth that therefore they naturally imagine that god is not present for if they were so perswaded they would not commit them though they esteemed god no better then a man secondly man by nature denie god power thus when a man offendes a magistrate by breaking any law which may deserue death or some great punishment hee is sore afraide and all his care is how hee may escape his punishing hand but let a man offend god neuer so much by breaking carelesly all his holy commaundements he neuer feares at all nor trembles at the punishment belonging vnto them how can this be but that howsoeuer he graunts there is a god yet he is not perswaded that god hath power to reuenge the cotempt of his laws amp therfore he neuer feares nor shrinks at the remembrance of him nor flieth at all from his reuenging hand but ploddeth on in sin without feare thirdly man by nature denieth god iustice for the iustice of god is to winke at sinne in no man but to condemne and punish it wheresoeuer he findes it by inflicting the curses of the law vpon it but man denieth this iustice for though he sinne against god law and his conscience tell him of it yet hee perswades himselfe there is no curse nor punishment due for it at least that he shall escape it nay though hee see neuer so many before him punished for the same sinne yet our nature is so blinde and so corrupt hee thinks for all that it shall not light on him and it is lamentable yet most true that the god of the ignorant man is a meere idoll a god made all of mercy and which hath no iustice in him at all amp their sins they carelesly lay all on christ and say god is mercifull and in this conceite they care not how ignorantly how loosely how profanely they liue and their hearts neuer haue a reuerent and awefull thought of the iustice of god these are the pitifull imaginations that all man by nature haue of god all these may be proued by euident scriptures the first in the psalme where dauid brings in the wicked saying to themselues god hath forgotten he hides his face he will not see he will not regard the second by the blasphemy of rabsakeh who vttred with his tongue that which all mens hearts think by nature what god can deliuer you out of my hand the third esay proues apparantly where hee tells vs that the wicked say wee haue made a couenant with death and with hell are we at agreement though a scourge runne ouer and passe through it shall not come at vs thus both scripture and plaine demonstrations proue this to be true that euery man by nature denieth god presence power and iustice and therfore is by nature a plaine atheist not beleeuing that god is god ind ede now furthermore there are sorts of people that put in practice this atheisme first su h as are not ashamed to say openly is there a god or no and dare dispute the question and at last auouch there is none but that all matters concerning god and his worship are nothing but deuises of politic man to keepe simple man in awe and to make fooles faine but these themselues are fooles of all fooles and the diuell deuised that impious conceite to keepe them in miserable blindnesse there haue beene such fooles in all ages yet in old time as dauid saith these fooles did but say in their hearts but now the fooles of these last amp rotten ages are ripe in their folly and they dare say with their mouthes there is no god these are monsters in nature and diuels incarnate worse then the diuell himself for he in iudgement neuer was an atheist these are to be marked amp hated worse then toads amp adders and if such a one can be conuicted by any lawful euidence if euer heretike or traytor deserued death such a one deserues tenne death as being a traytor to god to mankinde and to nature her selfe and though these wretches say there is no god yet make they a god of themselues sacrificing all their affections to their pleasure and their profit the second sort are such as acknowledge and worship a god but a false god these haue beene in all country and in most ages as history doe shew some worshipping the sun some the moone some starres some beast birds fish some dead idols of wood or stone or metall and of this sort amp no better are some in these churches where the true god is worshipped for the apostle saith couetousnesse is idolatry for if a mans heart be set wholly on riches then the wedge of gold is his god and to other whose affections are all on pleasure their belly is their god let these man hold in iudgement as they can their practice i am sure proclaims atheisme the third sort are such as worship the true god but in a false manner and of these there are principall sorts first turkes secondly iewes who hold the true god but denie the trinity of persons and the deity of christ thirdly the true papist holds in word one god amp the trinity of persons as wee doe but looke at their doctrine and if their words haue any naturall meaning they denie it for if the second person be true christ then hath hee two natures godhead and manhood but by their fained transubstantiation they quite take away the truth of the manhood and againe christ hath three offices hee is the true king priest and prophet of his church and if he be not so he is not christ but the papists doctrine in plaine words and necessarie consequence denieth them all as hath beene often proued vnto their shame and published to the world and they neuer yet to this day could or durst answere it for if they doe they shall soone either heare of vs againe or else we will recant it but till then it appeares that their god is by their doctrine not the true god but an idoll for he that denieth the son denieth the father also as saith s john the fourth sort of atheists are such as acknowledge and worship the true god and worship him in true manner for the outward worship but in their liues and deedes denie him and these are not to be sought for in turkey or iurie or italy for all churches are full of such protestant atheists italy may haue more atheists in iudgement then wee but these hypocrites and atheists in life are here also those tares we haue amongst our corn of these speakes the apostle that they professe to know god but denie him in their works let this seeme no wonder that such man be called atheists for the apostle saith plainely he that careth not for his family is worse then an infidell whereby it appeares a man may be a professour of the gospel or a christian in profession and an infidel or atheist in his practice amp it is certaine let any man professe what he will if his life be nought his religion is a false religion in him now then to shut vp this point with the vse thereof if this be true that there are so many sorts of atheists that almost the world is full and that we are all so by nature then first let vs see how hard a matter it is to beleeue in god aright and if no man come to god but he that beleeueth god aright then we see its no maruel though so fewe come to god let vs therefore go to god by earnest prayer to giue vs his spirit to worke true faith in our hearts and to make vs of a true beliefe and secondly seeing man may be christians in profession and atheists in practice let vs all looke narrowly to our selues and ioyne with our profession conscience and obedience for else the more we know god the worse we are it may please god after to giue vs better mindes but as yet we are no better then deniers of god and though wee come neere god in profession and in his outward seruice yet indeede we are farre from him because wee want that true faith which must professe god not in iudgement alone but in practice and that will bring vs neere vnto god for hee that commeth to god must beleeue that god is and thus much for the first thing to be beleeued by him that will come to god and please him the second is and that he is a rewarder of them that seeke him it is a notable sentence and one of the most comfortable in the booke of god and containes the second thing to be beleeued the parts are naturally two how a man doth seeke god how god rewards them that seeke him for the first a man truly seeketh god by doing foure actions first a man must forsake himselfe goe out of himselfe and as it were loose himselfe in his owne iudgement when he intends to seeke god if any aske how that may be i answer thus a man must labour to see his sinnes fully and distinctly and in sight thereof be cast downe in himselfe as a man is when hee seeth his debts then let him looke into himselfe and see if hee can finde in himselfe any ability to pay those debts or any meanes in the world to satisfie god ustice and purchase pardon and if vpon due examination he finde none at all no not the least nor any thing in himselfe but an accusing and raging conscience let him then fall out of all loue with himselfe nay hate and abhorre himselfe and his owne basenesse and lastly let him despaire of his owne saluation in or from himselfe and thus doing he forsakes himself denieth himselfe and euen looseth himselfe and thus necessarily must he do to himselfe that will set his heart to seeke the lord for god will be found of none that hope to finde helpe at any hand but his they therfore that seeke god but will seeke themselues too do iustly loose both god and themselues secondly he that will seeke god aright when hee hath lost himselfe must hunger in his heart and soule not after wealth and honours ease or pleasures but after the fauour and mercy of god in christ for the forgiuenesse of his sinnes and one drop of christes bloud to wash away the guilt and staine of his defiled and sinfull soule must be dearer to him then all the pompe and glory of tenne worlds looke how a hungry soule hungers after meate and a faintie soule thirsteth after drinke so must his soule hunger after god mercy and thirst for christs bloud and these are necessary for as a man that vndertakes a long iourney must be prouided of meate and drinke so hee that vndertakes the iourney to goe seeke the lord must haue this prouision for the diet of his poore soule god mercies and christes merits and he that seeks without a soule hungring after these may seeke long and finde nothing thirdly if he will truly seeke god he must not goe in euerie path but take the true amp liuing way which christ hath consecrated by his bloud nor take any guide but trust to christs spirit alone to be his guide nor make many mediators or messengers to god but make christ alone to god the father wee must therefore goe to him and yeeld vp our selues to be taught and guided by him amp leaue our sute to be preferred by him we must not looke to come to god by running on pilgrimages to this or that saints picture or bones or to our lady of loreto many haue sought god in these but who euer found him nay alas thou maist lodge in her forged tabernacle at loreto all thy life and lie in hell for all that when thou article dead and maist kisse all the saints pictures and bones and haire and all their reliques in spaine and italy and all cannot get thee one sight of god fauourable countenance nor againe must we looke to come to god by our good works though we are to doe them they are good markes in the way and good euidences of a right way but they cannot open heauen and let thee in and therefore when thou hast done all thou canst thou must forsake them all in matter of iustification and comming to god onely thou must goe to god by christ and cleaue to him alone hee is the doore the way the truth the life and certainly neuer man found god that sought him not in christ alone and when popish deuises and distinctions haue done all they can man will be found liers and christ to speak truth saying no man commeth to the father but by me lastly when all these are done then must thou beleeue that god is become thy mercifull father in christ and is reconciled vnto thee in him for there is no feare but if thou seeke god in christ thou shalt finde him and when thou hast done the three former things thou maist safely and assuredly beleeue that thou hast truly sought god and after all these if thou haue not firme and liuely faith thou doest not secke god for as it is impossible without faith to please god so is it impossible without faith to finde god thus if a man lose himselfe long after god mercy take christ alone for his guide and mediator and stedfastly beleeue his reconciliation with god by christ then he seekes god aright and to this seeking belongs a reward and blessing now then if this be to seeke god here is some light giuen to a great question whether the church of rome be a true church and their doctrine truely catholique or erroneous and failing in fundamentall points for answer can that be a true church which doth not bring her children to seeke god or that catholique doctrine which teacheth not her children to seeke god the right way but sends them into by wayes surely if this be to seeke god then search all the popish doctors and almost all their writers and see whether a man be not taught to seeke god quite in another walke which way of theirs whether is ordinarily bring the seekers to god or no we leaue to god mercifull iudgement but for our selues as we see we haue the true amp liuing way the sure and infallible way by christ to god by the son to the father let vs reioice in the comfort of so rich a mercie and be thankfull to the lord for reuealing himselfe vnto vs and opening vnto vs the true way to him and to his glorie and thus much for the first point how we must seeke god the second is how he is a rewarder of them that seeke him i answer god rewards them that seeke him first by offring himselfe graciously to be found of them that seeke him for he neuer hides himselfe nor turnes away from the soule that seeketh him but rather turnes to him and meetes him that comes to him hee is that good father which saw the prodigall son afarre off and met him and receiued him luke yes rather is it true that he is found of them that sought him not then euer sought by any that found him not and hereby god much magnifieth his grace and mercy to mankinde in being so assuredly found when man seeke him for in this world it is not so all man seeke the face of the prince saith salomon true but all man finde it not no accesse to great man is not so easie they and their fauour are so inclosed that man may long seeke afore they finde either them or it but god here is not so inclosed as he will not be seene nor spoke to hee is found of them that seeke him and as hereby hee honoureth himselfe so hee highly rewardeth his servant for there is no greater contentment to a subiect then to perceiue his seruice pleaseth his prince nor greater ioy then to finde his gratious fauour when they seeke it let then this practice of the great god of heauen first of all teach the great ones of this world to be willing to be found when they are sought vnto thereby shall they honour themselues and cheere vp the hearts of their people who seeke vnto them and againe it may be a rich comfort to the poore ones of this earth who when they see they must long looke and waite and pray and pay and seeke the face and fauour of great man and cannot finde may then remember yet they haue a god who will not shut the dore vpon them will not turne away will not keepe secret will not feare them away with a rough answer or a sower looke but hath this honourable and princely grace he wil be found of them that seeke him secondly hee rewardeth them that seeke him by bestowing his loue and fauour on them not onely he but his fauour shall be found of all that seeke him it is god fauour that god children seeke and his fauour they shall be sure to finde this is no small reward vnto them for in this world a man thinkes he hath enough if he haue the princes fauour and therefore it was the comon phrase in old time let me finde grace or fauour in the eyes of my lord the king so speake god children vnto the lord it is not wealth nor honours we seeke for at god hand but let vs finde fauour in the eyes of the lord our god and so they doe what euer they finde in this world thirdly he rewardeth them not with his naked fauour but with the most gracious testimonies thereof that can be which are two forgiuenesse of their sinnes and eternall life and glory with himselfe this is all a prince can doe to his subiect who hath offended him to forgiue him the fault and remit the punishment and to aduance him to honour this doth the lord to all that seeke him he forgiues them the debt they owe him whereby life and soule and all was forfaited to him and giues them also life euerlasting so plentiful a reward is giuen them from that god vnder whose wings they are come to trust fourthly hee rewardeth them with the beginnings of heauen and happinesse euen in this world a good conscience and ioy in the holy ghost the comfort whereof is more euen in the bitterest affliction then all the pleasures and contentments in the world lastly with the appurtenances of heauen and of eternall life namely the good blessings of this life a competent portion whereof god giueth his children in this world as tokens of his fauour and as rewards of their seruice and seeking him now as this place doth ayme at all these rewards so principally and directly the holy ghost meaneth eternall life as though hee had said hee that commeth to god must stedfastly beleeue that god is able and most willing to reward all that come to him with a better reward then this worlde can yeeld euen with eternall life and glory for his sonnes sake but then will some obiect god rewardeth vs therefore we merit therefore good works deserue i answere this place indeede is grosly abused by the papists for that purpose but we are to know the truth is farre otherwise for god rewardeth man for two causes first for his promise sake and that is for his owne sake for it was his owne goodnesse that made him promise and no former debt he owed to man againe hee rewardeth our good works not for our merits for they are nothing but of death and curses but for christ and his merits for their worthinesse are our good workes rewarded so then here are two causes of god rewarding and yet mans merits are neither of both and so the argument is nought that god rewardeth therefore we merit for god doth it for other causes thus these spiders gather poison out of this flower but let vs sucke the honey for this notable sentence hath excellent vse first if god be a rewarder of them that seeke him then not of them that seeke him not who seeke not god wicked and vngodly man seeke him not but rather seeke to auoide him and his seruice this sentence therefore is heauie against them for when they heare it their conscience answereth but wee seeke not god therefore wee can looke for no reward from him doest thou seeke the world then must the world be thy rewarder doest thou seeke to please thy selfe then must thou reward thy selfe and if thou wilt please the diuell by liuing in sinne then must hee be thy paymaister alas pitifull and fearefull will these rewards be againe if god reward none but them that seeke him here appeares the reason why so many papists die in our religion and with vs cleaue to christes merits alone when they come to die because their conscience then tells them that by their pilgrimages reliques will worships and manie more of their courses ordinarie in popery they did neuer seeke god but themselues amp their owne honour gaine and credite and full well knew they that there is no reward due for such seruice and therefore by their practice they make it a true saying that it is good liuing a papist but dying a protestant secondly if god be a rewarder of them that seeke him then wee see it is most true which the apostle saith it is not in vaine to serue god corinthian for god is a rewarder of them that seeke and serue him therefore the atheist and profane man of this world who say it is in vaine to serue god and what profit is there that we haue kept his commaundements are heere conuinced to be liers against the truth then seeing it is so let this admonish vs all to seeke and serue god in all truth and sinceritie knowing wee serue him who will reward it nothing more encourageth a man to serue his lord and king then to see that his paines are regarded and his seruice rewarded nor more discourageth a man then the contrarie if therefore god did euer forget anie that serued him let vs bestowe seruice elsewhere and thinke him vnwoorthie to be sought to but if contrariwise hee neuer forgot nor deceiued nor disappointed anie that serued him then is hee most worthie to haue the seruice both of our soules and body dauid indeede once said in vaine haue i cleansed my heart and washed my hands in innocencie but he was then in a strong temptation as himselfe there confesseth but afterwards when he went into the sanctuarie of god and searched the truth of the matter he confesseth he was deceiued and therefore as in the first verse hee had acknowledged that god was good to israel so in the last he concludeth that it is good for him to draw neere vnto god and so though the temptation was very vehement yet as faith appeared in the beginning so it had victory in the end and testified that god is good to all that seeke him another time also for he was a man of many sorrowes and temptations being in some extreame distresse his corruption so preuailed that he said all man are liers whatsoeuer samuel or god or nathan and other prophets haue told me of god loue and mercy and of his promises and prouidence and fatherly care i see it is all false and nothing so now surely if dauid or all the kings in the world can proue this then god is not worthy to be sought after but great man thinke they may say any thing especially when they are moued as dauid here was but when dauid entred into himselfe amp considered the words he had so presumptuously vttred vpon better aduise hee confesseth and writes it vp for all posterities to god glory and his owne shame that it was in passion i said in my feare all man are liers this he said in his haste or in his feare but vpon aduise in the next verse hee confesseth god benefits were so many and so great to him as hee cannot tell what to render to the lord for them and in another place he crieth out in admiration o how great is thy goodnesse which thou hast laid vp for them that feare thee and put their trust in thee euen before the sonnes of man wee see then that merciful promise of christ is euer made good seeke and ye shal finde math none euer sought god but found wee may seeke our owne pleasures and liue loosely and be deceiued and heare that fearefull question what profit haue ye now of these things rom what reward but shame and sorrow but if we seeke god aright we neuer loose our labour let vs therefore seeke god let the hand of our hearts knocke at god mercie gate in christ and wee shall not goe away without a reward the prodigall childe fled from his father spent all and lost his fauour but he no sooner said i will returne and humble my selfe to my father but he found him and wan his fathers fauour againe so let vs but offer our selues to seeke god god vnderstandeth our thoughts long before he will meet vs and receiue vs and giue vs a reward thirdly as god rewardeth them that seeke him so all that seeke him none misse him all finde that seeke great ones haue not accesse and the poore kept out but all receiued as they come no difference but the more carefullie anie seeke the more welcome are they heere let princes and great man learne their duties at god by whose grace and permission they are what they are first let them thinke it vnbeseeming their greatnesse to let any serue them without a reward and a staine to their honour not to let well deseruing subiects finde their fauour let them not daunt their hearts by not regarding them and their paines but let them encourage them to serue them by looking at them by good countenances and good speeches and by rewarding euery one according to his worth all great man should esteeme this as one of the pearles of their crownes to haue it said of them such a one is a rewarder of them that serue him againe let them learne to dispence their fauour according to reason and not affection onely god is indifferent and equall to all that seeke him so let princes be for that is true honor amp iustice to reward each one as he deserues and that hee may finde the best who doth best this will make euery one striue who should be first and forwardest in all seruiceable duties further this must teach them not to despise them that are vnder them in this world for howsoeuer the state of this world requires that difference of persons else it cannot stand it is nothing so with god nor in the world to come for there the subiect the servant the poore man may chalenge his part in god fauour as well as the best nay whosoeuer seeketh the most carefully shall finde the best reward moreouer here is a comfort to the poore and the meaner sort of man who are appointed by god to be vnderlings in this world seeke they fauour here and finde it not worke they here and doe their duties and are not rewarded let them learne to seeke god who will assuredly both regard what they doe and abundantly reward it fourthly seeing god is a rewarder of them that seeke him here is a comfortable encouragement against two great impediments which hinder many a man from seruing god first to seeke god is but a matter of mockerie to profane man for let a man set his face to ierusalem there are presently samaritanes which for that cause will hate and mocke him let a man set his heart to seeke god by hearing the word more carefully praying to god instructing his family or keeping the sabbaoth more carefully then afore and forthwith he is the laughing stocke and the byword to profane man but loe here is comfort the god whom thou seekest will reward thee and that so richly that thou wilt thinke thy selfe well recompenced both for thy seruice and their mockes in this world man care not who thinke or speake euill of them so the prince like them and shall it not encourage vs to seeke god though the world mocke vs seeing so doing we please god and so farre doe please him as he will highly reward vs those therefore that fall from religion for those mockers it appeares they seeke not to please god but man secondly for a man that is a magistrate or a minister to doe his duty carefully is the high way to vndergoe a burden of contempt and hatred insomuch as many good man are afraid to be either magistrates or ministers for first wicked man must needs hate them because the one is to rebuke and the other to punish their faults and againe euen good man are too respectlesse of them that are in these places amp for the most part neither yeeld them that reuerence nor reward that is due vnto them but often times a man for all his paines and care taken for church or common wealth is recompenced with hatred envy grudges euill words and slanderous reportes in this case the comfort is this that though a man be in the world neither regarded nor rewarded as his desert is yet the lord seeth what hee doth and is a plentifull rewarder of all that seek amp serue him and therefore especially of them who not onely themselues serue him in his chiefe places of seruice but also doe winne many other to seek and serue god fiftly if god be a rewarder of them that seeke him then doubtlesse he is a reuenger of them that hate him for he that can mightily reward his followers can also mightily be reuenged of his enemy these two are the two parts of a kings power to be able highly to aduance his friends and mightily to punish his enemy therefore principally this belongs to the king of kings this sentence therefore is a thunderbolt of a most fearefull threatning against all impenitent sinners assuring them that if they persist to profane god holy name by their carelesse sinning against him they shall be sure to finde and feele him a powerfull reuenger of them that hate him thus he promiseth himselfe deuter i lift vp my hand to heauen and i say i liue for euer if i whet my glittering sword and my hand take hold on iudgement i will execute vengeance on my enemy and reward them that hate me where also note how the same phrase is vsed for as here the apostle saith god is a rewarder of them that seeke him so in deuteronomie a rewarder of them that hate him if any obiect how these two can stand together for a man had as good hate him as seeke him if the same reward belong to both i answere a reward but not the same reward belongs vnto them theeues and murderers are iustly rewarded when they die for their facts and the king rewards a good servant when hee aduanceth him to honour they that seeke god are rewarded with mercies and fauours aboue their desert they that hate god are rewarded with vengeance and torments according to their desert and this shall all wicked man and enemy of god be as sure to finde as euer any that sought god obtained mercie but worldly man will say we hate not god wee are no iewes nor turkes we are christened amp come to the church according to the law as good subiects should doe i answer neither doe turkes nor iewes hate god if this be all for they denie not the godhead but acknowledge it and are circumcised and liue more strictly in their deuotions then most christians here is therefore more required or else we shall make them also good friends with god but a man may hate god and be neither turke nor iew hee may acknowledge christ and the trinitie and yet hate god for as christ saith he that is not with me is against mee and hee that gathereth not with me scattereth so is it here hee that seeketh not serueth not and loueth not god hateth god for there is no man can know god but he must needes either for his mercies loue him or else hate him for his iustice against sinne and sinners againe christ bids vs if you loue me keepe my commaundements if then to keepe god commandements be a sign of one that loues god it is a sign that one loues not god when hee hath no care to keepe them by which two places it appeares that whosoeuer makes not conscience of sinne is god enemie and that god so reputes him therefore let this feare euery man from liuing carelesly in his sinne and driue him to true repentance for else let him assure himselfe god is not so plentifull a rewarder of them that seeke him but he is as powerfull a reuenger vpon those that hate him lastly if god be a rewarder of them that seeke him wee learne the great difference between god seruice and the diuels the diuels servant are fed with faire words but get nothing the diuell is able to giue them nothing but god servant as wee see heere are plentifully rewarded god is a rewarder of them that seeke him but the diuell is a deceiuer of them that serue him but will some say there is none so mad to be the diuels servant i answere hee that doth any mans worke is either his servant or his slaue but euery sinfull wicked man doth the diuels worke for sinne is the diuels worke therefore all impenitent sinners are the diuels servant it is christes argument to the iewes you are of your father the diuell for the workes of your father you will doe murthers and lies are his workes you liue in these sinnes and doe these workes therefore you are his servant againe the holy ghost teacheth vs that whosoeuer committeth sinne and liueth therein without repentance the same is the servant of sinne now sinne is but the bawde or broker to the diuell they that are the servant of sin sinne preferres them to the diuell and so they become his servant therefore whosoeuer is the servant of sinne is by that meanes the slaue and servant of the diuell also which if it be true it will fall out vpon the reckoning that the diuell hath more servant in the world then god hath which is so much the more lamentable in as much as he deludeth all his servant and is not able to reward them nor to giue them any good thing but will some say this is nothing so for contrariwise who haue the honours pleasures and wealth of this life who haue hearts ease and the world at will but such man i answere true it is commonly so but haue they those from sathan no not the least of them all but all from god for euery man is god childe by creation and some by grace to euery one of his children he ordaines and giues a portion but to his children by grace a double portion both here and in heauen the wicked man they will not feare nor serue him therefore they haue no part nor portion in heauen but here they haue it so saith dauid there are some man which are man of this world and haue their portion in this life these mens bellies god filleth with his hidden treasures they and their children haue enough and leaue the rest for their children after them where it is manifest that wicked man haue their parts and portions of god blessings in this world and that all their wealth and pleasures are graunted them by amp from god as their portion reseruing y e principall part of the portion of his children for a better life therefore all the good things of this life which diues receiued and all wicked man doe receiue in this life are not any rewards of sathan but gifts of god so vnworthy a maister is the diuell to serue indeede he will promise his poore slaues any thing but can performe nothing but will lie vnto them and deceiue them he told christ confidently when he let him see the glory and greatnesse of this world all this is mine and i giue it to whom i will but hee was a lier from the beginning amp so he is here he lied to the first adam and no maruell that dare auouch so fond and loude a lye in the presence of the second adam iesus christ he promised the first adam to make him god and heere the second adam to make him king and lord of all the world and the glory of it but he performed both alike he deceiued the first and so had the second also if he had trusted him nor did euer any trust him but he deceiued him i meane euen for the base things of this life witnesse else all his witches his most deuoted and professed servant of all other if euer he made anie one of them wealthy all ages are not able to shew one whereas on the other side there was neuer man that serued god but had a competent measure of comforts for this life and some abundance and yet all that but the first fruits and beginnings of that reward which is laid vp for them in another world which being true is it not a strange and lamentable case to see man for all this debase themselues to this base and slauish seruice of sathan and to refuse this high and honourable seruice of almighty god a common servant in this world hath more wit he if he ca heare of a better seruice a maister who giues better wages and who better preferres his servant will leaue his old maister amp make meanes to get the other and shall not we be as wise for both soule and body as they for the body alone shall they leaue a man for a man and shall not we leaue the diuell for god let vs therefore abandon the base seruice of sathan who neither can nor will reward them that serue him put away so ill a maister who hath not so much as meate and drinke to giue vs for wee haue euen that from god but of his owne he hath nothing to giue vs saue in this world sorrow and shame and an ill conscience and in the world to come the torments of hell with himselfe and let vs all seeke the blessed seruice of god if wee know not how to attaine it goe to christ by heartie confession of thy sinnes and earnest prayer and he will preferre thee to god his father for neuer was any denied that with a good and true heart offred himselfe to god seruice then shal we feele and finde what a blessed thing it is to be god servant of whom it was euer true which the holy ghost here saith and is and euer shall be that he is an honourable rewarder of them that seeke him and thus we haue in some part the meaning and vse of this notable sentence wherein wee haue stoode the longer because it is one of the most excellent principles of all practicall diuinitie now put all together and we shall see how it proues henoch to be taken away by faith which is the first ground and the maine matter of all this exsample and of these two verses god is a rewarder of all his children that seeke him by faith therefore it is faith by which god children please god and therefore holy henoch who was taken vp by god from earth to heauen both pleased god by faith and by faith was taken away and thus much for the commendation of henochs faith and consequently the exsamples of such as liued in the first world before the floud now followeth the exsample of noah who liued in both worlds both before and after the floud by faith noah being warned of god of the things which were as yet not seene moued with reuerence prepared the arke to the sauing of his houshold through the which arke he condemned the world and was made heire of the righteousnesse which is by faith in this verse is contained the third exsample and the last in order of those who liued afore the floud in the first and olde world namely of the renowned patriarke noah the tenth from adam of whom and whose faith great amp glorious things are spoken in this verse and that in a high and excellent stile full of maiestie and diuine eloquence concerning noahs faith two points are laide downe first the ground of his faith secondly the commendation of it the ground of his faith was a speciall reuelation fro god in these words noah being warned of god the things reuealed wherof god warned him are laid down two wayes first generally to be things as yet not seene then particularly three in number god iudgement vpon the sinfull world that hee was purposed to destroy it by water god mercie on noah that hee would saue him and his family that he would saue him by an arke and therefore he must make one and these be the things whereof noah was warned of god his faith is commended by three worthy effects or operations in him it moued in him a reuerence or a reuerent regard of the warning sent him from god it made him prepare the arke of which arke there are set downe two ends it made him heire of the righteousnesse which is by faith this i take it is the true resolution of these wordes and they containe manie excellent things concerning his faith by faith noah being warned of god of the things which were as yet not seene by faith that is by a generall and historicall faith and also by a true and sauing faith in the messias to come noah being warned of god of the iust iudgement hee purposed to bring vpon the world by an vniuersall floud and of his mercifull prouidence to him and his family that hee would saue them by an arke all which things were then to come and therefore vnseene hee beleeued these forewarnings of god and therefore in reuerence to this message from god he prepared the arke and thereby saued his houshold and condemned the wicked world and so his faith by all these appearing to be a true and liuely faith did make him a iust and righteous man in god sight this is the summe and substance of noahs exsample let vs speake of the seuerall parts in order the first point is the ground of his faith a warning or an answere from god for he being a righteous man in that wicked age wherein all the world weltred in wickednesse and walking before god in great holinesse when no man cared for religion hee had this speciall fauour from god that when hee purposed to destroy the world for their sinne hee first of all reuealed to righteous noah that purpose of his so that these words haue reference to the reuelation which noah had from god in the of genesis for this message came not from god by any prophet for wee know none in those euill dayes except noah himselfe but either by the ministerie of an angell or else by immediate reuelation from god himselfe and this fauour he receiued from god not for any cause in the world but because he was a holy and righteous man from hence wee may learne diverse excellent instructions first whereas god maketh choise of noah to reueale vnto him his counsell and his iudgements to come wee learne that this is a prerogatiue which god bestoweth on such as feare him he reuealeth his counsels to them in a speciall manner whether they be purposes of iudgements vpon his enemy or of mercies vnto his church thus dealt he with abraham gen shall i saith god hide from abraham the thing that i will doe which thing was the destruction of sodome and her sisters and so when the sodomites liued in wanton carelesnesse and put farre from them the euill day then abraham knew from god their destruction was at hand and as in that for is it generally true in all his great workes that the lord god will doe nothing but he reueales his secrets to his servant the prophets amos now this is not a prerogatiue of prophets alone or of such as were extraordinary man as abraham was but the secrets of the lord are amongst such as feare him psalme all that feare the holy name of god are god friends and of his counsaile and therefore not abraham onely is called the friend of god iames but of all true beleeuers saith christ john you are my friends if you doe what i commaund you henceforth i call you not servant but friends for the servant knoweth not what his maister doth but all things that i haue heard of my father haue i made knowne vnto you as if he had said i will communicate and impart my secrets vnto you as one friend doth vnto another as farre as shall be fit for you to know and the apostle saith corinthian a faithfull and a holy man discerneth into the deepe counsailes of god which are reuealed vnto them as much as concerneth their saluations and sometimes more as here vnto noah who was fore warned of god of things then not seene this prerogatiue of god children is to be vnderstoode with some cautions first that this is more proper to prophets and holy ministers of god then to ordinary christians secondly that it was more ordinary in the old testament then now in the dayes of the gospell if any obiect then the state of the church afore christ was better then it is now vnder christ i answere not so for first we are recompenced by hauing the scriptures perfect and complete which they had not and by hauing the substance of their shadowes and the performance of their promises in which respects our state is farre more excellent then theirs and secondly for this particular i answere they indeede had more ordinarie reuelation of matters personall and priuate and not directly touching saluation but of such things as are generall and doe necessarily concerne saluation wee in the time of the new testament haue more euident demonstration and more full reuelation then they had afore christ for exsample particular mercies to some faithfull man or particular iudgements on god enemy whether particular man or whole kingdomes were after reuealed to godly man in those dayes as here to noah but saluation by the messias and the manner how the messias should saue his church is more fully and plainly reuealed now then in those dayes out of which consideration ariseth the third caution which is that reuelations of god will to be expected now vnder the gospell are ordinarily nothing else but these the true meaning of scripture amp a discerning of true scripture from forged of true sacraments from supposed of true doctrine from false of true pastors from false prophets these amp such like as farre forth as they are necessary to saluation all true and faithfull beleeuers which out of an humbled heart by deuoute prayer doe seeke it at god hand are sure to haue reuealed vnto them from god but as for other purposes of god of personall and particular matters or what shall be his blessings or what his iudgements to these and these man families cities or kingdomes or when or how he will change states or translate kingdomes or by what extraordinarie meanes hee will haue his gospell propagated or a declining church or state vpholden these we are not to expect nor easily to belieue any that shall say such things are reuealed vnto them and yet wee tye not the lord in such straite bonds but that hee may sometime extraordinarily reueale his purpose therein to some his selected servant yet prouided that that reuelation be examined and allowed of the church but as for such things as concerne immediatly the saluation of our soules god spirit doth most comfortably reueale them vnto vs in our prayers in his word and in his sacraments of all which it is most true that the secrets of god are amongst them that feare him the vse of this doctrine is double for instruction and for exhortation for our instruction here we learne how to answere the church of rome they aske vs how doe wee know true religion from erroneous or true scripture or sacraments from forged we answere first by it selfe by sight and sense of the excellencie thereof as we know gold from brasse or siluer from lead but what if the brasse or tinne be gilded ouer i then answere secondly wee can know gold from brasse and siluer from tinne by the sound and smell and hardnesse to endure and by the operation so there is a spirituall sound of the scriptures in the eares of a christian a spiritual comfort and taste in true religion a spirituall operation in holy mens hearts of the true sacraments but what if false prophets come in sheepes cloathing and by lying wonders seeme to giue the same sound taste smell vertue and operation vnto their forgeries or at least chalenge it and say that theirs is true i answere lastly then we know true religion true scripture true sacraments true prophets true doctrines from false by a holy and supernaturall reuelation from god spirit which by euident and powerfull demonstration assureth vs what is true and what is false for the substance of saluation and this spirit is giuen to all that in true humility doe seeke it in holy prayer and in a holy and frequent vse of god word and sacraments and to none else and surely if the papists were as well acquainted with the spirit of god as they are with their owne forged reuelations they would neuer denie it by force of this testimonie a christian man knoweth as assuredly as that god is god that the pope as now he is and as hee exerciseth his place and power cannot be the true vicar of christ and that popery as it is now established by the councell of trent and taught by the most learned of their side cannot be the true religion nor the safest way to heaue and when question is what is the meaning of this place there is one god and one mediatour between god and man the man christ iesus if all the world should say the contrary a christian man will know and beleeue there are no more mediatours to god but christ or of that place that christ was offred for our sinnes once for all that ther is no sacrifice can purchase vs pardon but his let papists colour the matter by vnsound distinctions as much as they can amp the same might be shewed in diverse other points and places and if any aske how this can be i answere noah was warned of god of things not seene so god children are warned and assured of god of such things as concerne their saluation though they be things beyond sense and reason god secrets doe belong vnto them the vse of exhortation is that if god warne his children of his will amp reueale his secrets to them this should moue and excite vs to become truly and indeede god servant for we serue not a lord that is strange and austere vnto vs that will not giue vs a good looke or a faire word nay hee is so farre from that that he calls vs to his holy counsell and makes vs knowe his secrets and communicates his owne selfe vnto vs by his blessed spirit and by that spirit reuealeth vnto vs many excellent mysteries of saluation which the carnal and profane man of the world neuer dreame of in the second place let vs obserue that noah being thus warned of god in this particular matter as he had beene formerly warned amp taught of saluation by a messias to come beleeueth not onely the generall promise of saluation but also this particular promise of his preseruation and deliuerance out of which his practice we may learne two things first that faith is a supernaturall worke of god in those mens hearts that haue it that it is a worke of god it appeareth in that it alwayes acknowledgeth and beleeueth god word that it is supernaturall it appeareth in that it apprehendeth and beleeueth whatsoeuer god word deliuereth be it neuer so incredible to reason or sense but how doth god worke this faith by his word for as god is the author and worker of faith so god hath appointed a meanes whereby he workes it and that is his word which word of god is the onely ordinarie outward meanes to worke faith and that word of god is two wayes to be considered either as reuealed by god himselfe as to noah heere or else being written by god is either preached by his ministers or read by a mans selfe in want of preaching and these are all one and are all meanes ordained of god to work faith and that not onely to begin it where it is wanting but to augment it where it is begun which being so it must teach vs all not onely with speciall care and reuerence to heare the word by whomsoeuer it is preached but also to heare it read yes to reade it our selues with all diligence so doing it will worke out and make perfect in vs that holy faith which will make vs blessed in our selues and accepted of god as it did noah in this place secondly heere wee learne what is the whole obiect of faith or what is all that that faith beleeueth namely nothing but god word and all and euery word of god so that faith hath two obiects differing not in nature but in degree principall and inferiour the principall obiect of true faith is the promise of saluation by christ the inferiour obiect thereof are all other particular promises of safety deliuerance prouidence helpe assistance comfort or what other benefit soeuer is made either to the whole church and so inclusiuely to any particular man or which are personally made vnto him for sauing faith beleeueth not onely the graund promise of saluation but all other promises either of spirituall or corporall blessings which are subordinate to the great promise and doe depend of it and are therefore apprehended by the same faith so noah heere had alreadie apprehended the maine promise of saluation by the messiah and had hid it in his heart and afterward when this particular promise of his deliuerance was made by the same faith he laid hold on it also and it is good reason that faith should doe so for if it apprehend the greater promise then no maruell though it take hold of all other inferiour promises which are but dependances vpon the principall by this that hath beene saide it appeareth that wee are wrongfully charged by them who say we teach that sauing faith beleeueth onely saluation by christ or apprehendeth only the promise of saluatio in christ for we say amp teach it apprehendeth also other particular promises amp euen y e promises of outward and temporall blessings as appeareth in this exsample of noah lastly in that noah a faithfull man is heere warned of god of the dangers ensuing that so he may auoid them we may learne the louing care that god hath ouer them who haue a care to feare and serue him thus dealt hee with his children in all ages for their comfort and preseruation to encourage all man to serue god in truth and vprightnesse as here noah did for so doing they may assure themselues of god care and prouidence ouer them euen then when his wrath smokes against the sinnes of the world and that furthermore in all exigents and extremities hee will each them either from his word or by the counsell of some others of his children or else by his owne secret inspiration what they are to do and what course to take for their safetie and deliuerance how often shall a christian man finde in the course of his life that god put into his minde to answere thus or thus or to foresee this or that by which his so doing he escaped som great danger so that though not in the same manner as noah was all faithfull man do daily finde that they are warned by god of such things as doe concerne them but what were those things whereof noah was warned from god the text saith of the things which were as yet not seene this hath not relation to the time when the holy ghost wrote these words but when god gaue the warning to noah for then they were not seene but were to come for they were not performed for many yeeres after as shall appeare in the particulars particularly they were these three first the great and iust wrath which god had conceiued against the sinfull world for the vniuersall corruption and generall sinfulnesse therof noah was a preacher of righteousnesse to that wicked age and as s peter saith epistle the very spirit of christ preached in him but they contemned both him and the spirit by which hee spake and made a mocke of him and all his holy admonitions and solaced themselues in all their sinfull pleasures without feare or respect of god or man pleasing themselues in their owne defiled wayes amp promising to themselues safety and security but behold this noah whom they esteemed a base and contemptible man vnworthy of their company to him is reuealed how short their time is and that they must be cut off in the midst of their iollity god children whom wicked man doe thinke and speake of with great contempt doe know full well the miserable state of such man and the fearefull dangers hanging ouer them when the wicked man themselues are farre from thinking of any such matter the second thing which god reuealed to noah was that he would saue him and his family from perishing by the water which he would bring vpon the world his faith was not in vaine god rewarded it with a singular preseruation thus dealt he alwayes with his children deliuering lot out of sodome gen rahab out of hierico ioshua the kenits from the amalekits sam and here noah out of that generall destruction and this god afore hand reueales vnto him for his greater comfort and security that when signes and strange tokens did foretell and shew that still the destruction was neerer and neerer still noah might comfort himselfe in the assurance of that mercifull promise which god had made him of his deliuerance and of his family also for his sake the third thing reuealed to him was the meanes whereby he should be saued from the vniuersall floud namely by an arke which for his more assurance hee is bid to make himselfe that so at euery stroke he gaue he might remember this mercifull promise of his god vnto him for as euery stroke in the making of the arke was a loude sounding sermon vnto that sinfull generation to call them to repentance so was it also an assurance vnto noah of his deliuerance of which ark amp of noahs obedience in making it we shall hereafter speake at large and thus much concerning the ground of noahs faith which was a warning or reuelation from god now followeth a second point namely the commendation of his faith or a description of the excellencie thereof by diverse and singular effects moued with reuerence the first effect of his faith is it moued in him a reuerence or a reuerent feare of that god that spake to him and of his iustice towards sinne and sinners and of his mercie towards him in this effect we are to consider two points the ground of this reuerence the occasions or motiues of it the ground whence this reuerence sprang was his true and sauing faith for the holy ghost first tells vs of noahs faith amp afterwards of this reuerent feare he had of god and his great workes where we learne that whosoeuer is endued with sauing faith is also touched with feare and reuerence at the consideration of god and his glorious workes whether they be works of his power his wisedome his mercy or his iustice or of all together for the first dauid could not see the workes of god power in the creation psalm but when he looked vp and beheld the heauens the workes of god hands the moone and the starres which he had ordained hee forthwith fell into a reuerence and admiration of god mercy to man for whom and whose vse he made them all for the second the same dauid could not enter into consideration of god wisedome in the admirable frame of mans body psalm ampc but he presently falls into a reuerence and admiration thereof in most excellent and passionate words thou possessest my reines thou coueredst me in my mothers wombe i will praise thee for i am fearefully and wonderfully made meruailous are thy workes and that my soule knoweth right well my bones are not hid from thee though i was made in a secret place yet thy eyes did see my substance when i was without forme and in thy booke were all my members written which in continuance were fashioned though there were none of them before how deere therefore are thy counsels to mee o god thus we see how this holy king cannot content himself with any tearmes to expresse his religious and reuerent conceite of god maiestie for the third god mercifull workes to his church and children haue alwayes beene considered of by good man with great reuerence and what shall i giue vnto the lord saith dauid for all his benefites poured on mee psalm but especially the iudgements of god haue beene alwaies entertained of god children with much reuerence and admiration blessed dauid saith my flesh trembleth for feare of thee and i am afraid of thy iudgements psalm how would this noble king haue trembled and been afraid if he had beene a priuate man and how glorious is god and his workes of iudgements whereat euen kings themselues doe tremble and the prophet habbacuk saith that when hee but hea d of god iudgements to come his belly trembled his lips shooke rottennesse entred into his bones habba and thus noah here hearing of god iust wrath against the sinfull world and of his purpose to ouerthrowe all liuing flesh by water was moued with great feare and reuerence at this mighty worke of god and from the view of this his great and iust iudgement his faith made him arise to a more earnest consideration of the maiestie of god by all which it is more then apparant that true faith wheresoeuer it is worketh a holy feare and reuerent estimation of god and of his workes and of god in and by his workes whereby on the contrary side it followeth that therefore to thinke basely or ordinarily of god to thinke scornefully of his workes or to denie his power and his hand in the great workes either of mercie or iudgement done in the world is an argument of a profane heart and wanting true faith the vse of this doctrine discouers the profanenesse and the great want of faith that ordinarily is in the world and that appeares by two euidences the first is to mens owne consciences the other is to the view and sight of all the world first man may see in themselues a profane heart and voide of faith by this euidence for doth a man in his heart thinke basely of god his power his iustice or his mercies doth he either doubt of them or granting them doth hee thinke of them without feare and am zement then assuredly his heart is voide of true faith and farre from the life and power of religion for assuredly where god is knowen and beleeued there that mans heart though hee be a king cannot once thinke of god without a reuerence of his maiestie and an admiration at his greatnesse and his owne basenesse therefore the want of this argueth a want of true religion and true faith in mens hearts secondly this profanenesse discouers it selfe to the world by want of reuerence to god workes let the lord send vnseasonable weather or famines or plagues or any strange signes in heauen or in earth forthwith they are but fooles that cry out behold the finger of god the hand of god no this is nature and is produced by naturall causes ill weather comes from the starres famines from ill weather and mens couetousnesse plagues from famines or from ill aires or else by apparant infection from another place but cannot nature and naturall meanes haue their place vnlesse they haue god place god ouerthroweth not them why should they ouerthrow god yet thus it is in the world and thus god is robbed of his glory and he is but a simple fellow which is moued with reuerence at sight of such things or begins to magnifie god power and iustice in them this is too apparant to be denied for haue wee not now as great causes of feare as can be noah heard of water and wee heare that fire is to destroy the worlde and ye where is hee that is mooued with reuerence as noah was and yet noah could saye the floud shall not be these yeeres but who can say and proue that this world shal not be destroyed by fire within these yeeres and till the floud came they had doubtlesse many othe plagues which were fore runners of the generall destruction all which as they came moued noah vnto reuerence and so wee in this age doe see the great workes of god iudgements vpon man vpon families vpon townes vpon country and whole kingdomes and wee feele his heauie hand in many sharpe strokes but who and where are they whose hearts feare god the more and doe tremble in the consideration of his iudgements nay alas amongst many it is but a matter of mockerie so to doe this is not the fault of our religion but the want of it for if man truly knew and beleeued in god they could not thinke nor speake of god nor looke at his workes but with feare and reuerence for as our feare of god is so is our faith little feare of god little faith and no feare at all no faith at all let therefore all man shew their religion by their feare of god and let euery christian acknowledge god in his workes england hath beene faulty herein in one point especially wee haue had great plagues which haue taken away many thousands in short time wherein god hath shewed himselfe mighty against our sinnes but god hand would not be seene nor acknowledged but onely nature and naturall causes but let england take heede that god send not a plague so generall and so greeuous that euen the most profane man euen the sorcerers of egypt if they were here doe acknowledge that it is the finger of god and so giue god that due reuerence which in his ordinary visitations he hath not thus wee see the ground whence this reuerence in noah sprang namely his faith now let vs see the occasions or considerations in noahs heart that made him feare the ground wherupon he feared was true faith for else he had not beene capable of any feare or reuerence of god but the occasions which stirred vp this feare in him were some things else now if we looke to humane reasons noah had no cause at all to feare as he did for first the iudgement was farre off yeeres after and common reason saith its folly to feare any thing so farre off but its time enough to feare when it is neere at hand againe he was one single man and the world was full of wise and mighty man they all heard of it yet none of them feared therefore their exsample might preuaile with him to keepe him from feare and to make him secure and careles e with the rest for exsamples are strong especially when they are so generall thirdly the strangenesse of the iudgement threatned was such as might driue any man in reason from fearing it at all for first who would euer beleeue that god would drowne all the world with water such a thing neuer had beene and therefore how could it be and againe if all should be drowned who would thinke that noah should escape and none but he these three considerations being wayed in the ballance of mans reason would haue kept noah from fearing or beleeuing this word of god but behold the power of faith it goeth beyond all humane reach fixeth it selfe fast on god word and therfore he not only beleeueth it but hath furthermore his heart possessed with a great reuerence of god maiestie vpon this message and there were three motiues stirring him vp vnto this reuerence first the consideration of god strange iudgement vpon the sinfull world to see that his wrath was so prouoked that he should bring so vnwonted a plague so strange both for the nature of it a floud of water to drowne man whereas generally all man can auoide the violence of that element amp for the measure of it so great as it should drown all the world and destroy all man now that which this iudgement of god wrought in noah the same effect should god iudgements worke in vs namely they should moue vs with reuerence for as christ saith our dayes are like noahs as it was in the dayes of noah so shall the dayes be before the comming of christ mathew these dayes are as wicked man are as couetous as cruell as malitious as voluptuous and yet as secure as they then were as full of sinne and yet as dead in sinne as they were then therefore noah looked for a floud yeeres after and who can tell whether our world shall last so long a time or no at least wee may safely say whatsoeuer the world doth there is no man liueth but within farre lesse time then yeeres is assured to be throwen to hell by a floud of god wrath at his death vnlesse in the meane time hee repent and yet alas where is hee that is moued with reuerence at consideration hereof the wicked man may escape the water of a floud but hee cannot scape the fire of hell hee cannot escape death hee cannot escape the last iudgement these are to come yet they are sure why then doe not man feare as noah did hee feared yeeres afore it came we can indeede tremble a little at a present iudgement as when fire breakes out when water ouerflowe when the plague destroyeth or when famine consumes but to tremble at a iudgement threatned though it be afarre off this is the worke of true faith this was in noah amp wrought in him a reuerence and so would it in vs if it were in vs when man crie fire fire wee stirre wee runne wee tremble but god crieth in his word the fire of hell the fire of his wrath and wee care not wee stirre not wee leaue not our sinnes wee are not moued with reuerence as noah was therefore it is more then manifest that holy faith is wanting in the world which noah had the second motiue stirring vp this reuerence in him was the consideration of god wonderfull mercie to him and his family in sauing them this mercy seemed so wonderfull to him both for that hee knewe it was vndeserued knowing himselfe a sinnefull man and therfore not able to merit god fauour and being priuy to himselfe of his owne manifolde imperfections and also vnexpected for he neuer thought to haue been spared alone in an vniuersall destruction therefore he wondred with reuerence at so great a mercy thus god mercies doe not onely winne a mans heart to loue god but euen to feare him with much reuerence this dauid proueth psalm there is mercy with thee o lord that thou maist be feared as though he had said thy great mercies to thy children o lord do make them conceiue a reuerent estimation of thee this made dauid cry out in a holy passion how excellent are thy mercies o lord psalm and as god childre wonder at the excellencies of god mercies vnto them so also at their owne basenesse and vnworthinesse thus doth holy dauid sam who as hee was a man of much faith so was he full of excellent meditations and reuerent speeches of god which are the true effects of faith when god had set him in his kingdome hee saith who am i o lord and what is my house that thou hast brought me hither and chronicle but who am i saith he and what is my people that wee should offer thus vnto the lord and doubtlesse euen so said noahs blessed soule often vnto the lord and to it selfe who am i o lord and what is my family that we should be chosen out of so many thousands and be saued when all the world perisheth let vs apply this to our church and state if any nation haue cause to say thus it is england god hath deliuered vs out of the thraldome of spirituall egypt and led vs out not by a moses but first by a childe then by a woman and giuen vs his gospell more fully and freely and quietly then any kingdom so great in the world and still deliuereth vs from the cursed plots of the pope and tyrannous inuasions of the spaniard who thought to haue marked vs in the foreheads with the brand of infamie and to haue done to vs as they haue done to other nation whom they haue conquered but god from heauen fought for vs and ouerthrew them in their owne deuises yes the lord put his hooke in his nosethrils and his bridle in his lips and caried him backe againe with shame and reproach wee are vnworthy of such a mercy if our soules doe not often say vnto god o lord what are we and what is our people that thou shouldst be so wonderfull in thy mercies vnto vs and particularly this must teach euery christian to be a carefull obseruer of the fauours amp mercies that god vouchsafes to his soule or body to him or his and the consideration of them must make him daily be moued with reuerence and reuerent thoughts of god maiestie amp still as the lord is more and more mercifull vnto him to beare still the more feare and reuerence vnto him for the same the last motiue of this reuerence in noah was the consideration of god power and wisedome both in the iudgement vpon the world and in the mercy vpon him for first in the iudgement it was wonderfull that god would chuse so weake an element as water to destroy amp vanquish the huge giants of those dayes but therein appeared first god power that by so weake meanes can cast downe his enemy and againe his wisedome that as an vniuersall wickednesse had polluted the whole world so a floud of water should wash the whole world secondly the mercy was also wonderful that god should chuse to saue noah by so strange a meane as an arke which should swim on the water for noah thought if the lord will saue me he will either take me vp into heauen as hee did henoch a little before or else make me build a house vpon the top of the highest mountaine but the lord will saue him by no such meanes but by an arke wherein appeared first god power that would saue him by so weake a meanes as might seeme rather to destroy him for noah must lye and swim in the midst of the water and yet be saued from the water and the arke m st saue him which in all reason if the tempests had cast it against the hard rockes and mountaines or vpon the strong castles and houses of the mightie giants would haue beene broken in pieces and so it had but that god himselfe was the maister and pilot in that voyage and secondly god wisedom shone cleerly in this means because god would haue him saued not in such sort as the world might not see it as it would haue beene if hee had beene taken vp into heauen or into the aire but would haue him saued in an arke that so al the wicked man as they ere a dying in the water or expecting death vpon the tops of the hills might see him liue and be saued to their more torment and to their greater shame who would not beleeue god word as he did for as the wicked in hell are more tormented to see the godly in the ioyes of heauen so doubtlesse were the wicked of that age to see noah saued before their eies the view of this power amp wisdom of god herein made noah giue great reuerence to god maiestie and no les e ought it to worke in the hearts of all true hear ed english man and faithfull christians for did not the lord restore amp establish the gospell to our nation by a child and by a woman and in her time when all other princes were against her cotrary to the rules of policy and did not god in our late deliuerance ouerthrow our enemy not so much by the power of man as by his owne hand did not he fight from heauen did not the starres and the winds in their courses sight against that sisera of spaine let vs therefore with blessed noah stad amazed to see god mercies amp with reuerence amp feare magnifie his great and glorious name and thus we haue the three motiues that moued in noah this reuerence of god the consideration first of his great iudgement on the sinfull world of his great mercy in sauing him of his admirable power and wisedome shewed both in the iudgement and the mercy hitherto of the first effect it followeth prepared the arke the effect of noahs faith wherby it is comended is that he vpon a comandement receiued fro god as we heard before doth make amp build an ark wherin to saue himself amp his family cocerning this ark much might be spoken out of y e book of gen but it is not to our purpose which is no more in this chapter but to shew the obedience and practice of faith and therein the excellencie of it now the point here to be spoken of is not the matter nor the measure nor the proportion nor the fashion nor the vses of the arke all which in the chapter of genesis are fully described but the action and obedience of noah in preparing it as god bad him whereof the holy ghost in genesis saith noah did according to all that god had commaunded him euen so did he now in this action of noahs faith diverse points of great moment are to be considered first why did god bid noah make an arke yeeres before the floud when hee might haue built it in three or foure yeeres the answere is god did so for diverse causes some respecting the sinfull world as that they might haue longer time and more warnings to repent euery stroke of the arke during these yeeres being a loude sermon of repentance vnto them againe that they might be without excuse if they amended not and lastly that their iniquities might be full and their sinnes ripe for vengeance but of all these we will not speake because they concerne not noah of whose faith we are onely to speake let vs therfore touch only those causes which concerne noah and in regard of him the lord did thus that he might try his faith and patience and exercise other graces of holinesse in him thus god dealeth with his servant alwayes hee exerciseth them many and strange wayes in this world he led the israelites in the deserts of arabia fourty yeeres whereas a man may trauell from rameses in egypt to any part of canaan in fourty dayes and this god did to humble them and try them and to know what was in their heart deut god promised abraham a son in whom all the nation of the earth should be blessed gen but he performed it not of yeeres after gen he gaue dauid the kingdome of israel and anointed him by samuel sam but he attained it not of many yeeres after amp in the meane time was persecuted and hunted by saul as a flea in a mans bosome or as a partridge in the mountaines sam and and thus god exercised him both in that and other his promises as he saith psalm in waiting i waited on the lord and psalm mine eyes faile for waiting for thy promise o when wilt thou comfort me thus god dealt with them and thus in some measure hee deales with all his children to humble and to try them and to know what is in their hearts for that in these cases man doe alwaies shew themselues and their dispositions when man enioy all things at their will and wish who cannot make a faire profession but where man are long deferred and kept from that is promised and they expect and are so long crossed in their expectation then they appeare in their owne colours and as god dealt with them so will he one way or other doe with vs if wee be his servant hee will at some time of our life or other lay some such affliction vpon vs as may try vs and our faith and our patience and our humility for if we be hypocrites and haue no true graces but onely a shew this will discouer it and if we haue true and sound faith and patience this will make them shine like orient pearles in their true and perfect beauty secondly as god bad noah build an arke so long time before any neede of it so he did without denying or gainesaying so saith the story in genesis he did according to all that god commaunded him and thus the holy ghost saith here he being warned of god by faith prepared the arke where we learne that where true faith is there followeth true obedience to euery commaundement of god insomuch as a godly beleeuing man no sooner heareth any duty to be commaunded of god but hee thinks his soule and conscience is tied to obedience and this is the nature of true faith and it is as impossible to be otherwise as it is for fire hauing fewell not to burne acts faith purifieth the heart namely from carelesse disobedience to god word for if from any corruption at all then from it especially because it is most contrary to the purenesse of true fai h this being so sheweth vs not any fault in our religion as the papists slander vs but the want of our religion and the want of true faith in the world for there is almost no obedience to god commaundements for first turkes amp iewes acknowledge not the scriptures and the papists haue set aside god commaundements to set vp their owne and few protestant haue the feeling of the power of true religion amp nothing indeed but a bare profession but it must be a feeling of the power of it which produceth due obedience and alas wee see man obay not god commaundements god saith sweare not by my name vainely keepe my sabbath where is there a man of many that feareth to breake these alas there are more mockers of such as would keepe them then carefull and conscionable keepers of them how truly said christ when the son of man commeth shall hee finde faith on the earth it is likely therefore these be the dayes wherin we may wait for the coming of christ for the generall want of obedience sheweth the generall want of faith but this obedience of noah is better to be considered of for it was very excellent amp extraordinary there being many hindrances that might haue stopped him in the course of his obedience and haue perswaded him neuer to haue gone about the making of the arke as first the great quantity of the ark amounting to many thousands cubits a work of huge labour amp great charge againe the length of his labour to last yeeres it is a tedious thing and troublesome to mans nature to be euer in doing and neuer to haue done thirdly the building of it was a matter of much mockery to the world for it signified the destroying of the whole world the sauing of him and his these things were taunted at by the worldly wise man of that sinful age and he was loudly laught at by many a man to thinke all the world should perish but much more if all perished to imagine that he and his should be deliuered lastly the building of the arke was a harsh thing to nature and naturall reason in many respects for first that all the world should be destroyed seemed not possible to be because it neuer had beene secondly it seemed not likely that god mercy should be so wholly swallowed vp of his iustice thirdly they must liue in the arke as in a close prison without comfort of light or fresh aire and amongst beast of all sorts and that for a long time hee knew not how long now reason would tel him he had better die with man then liue with beast and better die a free man and at liberty then liue a prisoner and better die with company then liue alone and that if god had purposed to saue him hee could haue vsed other meanes and more easie more direct amp more safe then this that therefore his deliuerance was to be doubted of and lastly reason would say i may make my selfe a gazing and mocking stocke to the world for yeeres and it may be then god purpose will be altred amp no floud will come or if it come amp i go into the arke and it chance to breake against the mountaines so that i perish with the rest then am i worst of all who perish notwithstanding all my labour therefore i had better let it alone and take my venture with the rest of the world these doubtlesse and many such naturall considerations came into his minde and stood vp as so many impediments of his faith but behold the power of true faith in the heart of a holy man it ouergoeth all doubts it breaketh through all difficulty to obay the will amp word of god yes it g ues a man wings with which to flie ouer all carnall obiections thus we see it here in nooh and afterward shall as cleerely see it in abraham and other holy man the vse of this doctrine discouereth the weaknesse of many mes faith for if the doctrine of the gospel go currat with our natural affectios or seem plausible to our natures we do formally obay it but if it crosse our affections or goe beyond our reason or controll our naturall dispositions then wee spurne against it we call it into question we are offended at it and denie our obedience here wants the faith of noah which caried him beyond the compasse of nature and reach of reason and made him beleeue and do that which neither nature could allowe nor reason like of amp which would be displeasing to his naturall affections let vs therfore learne to practice true faith by beleeuing forthwith what god shal say vnto vs without asking aduise or hearing the obiections of flesh and bloud god threatned in times past the ouerthrow of the great monarchy of the assyrians chaldeans persians grecians romanes reason did make doubts how it could be but faith beleeued it and it is done god in later times threatned the fall of abbies and dispersing of monkes for their wickednesse it seemed impossible to reason yet faith in some beleeued it and it came to passe god now threatneth the ruine of babylon and the full reuelation of antichrist and the ouerthrow of the new found hierarchie of the jesuit which glitter so in worldly glorie and in outward strength this seemes hard to bring to passe but let faith beleeue it for it is god word and shall be fulfilled in his season god hath said that our body shall rise againe euen these body which are burned to ashes or eaten of beast or fish or turned to dust in the earth this is a wonder to nature an amazement to reason but faith will beleeue it and shall finde it true for god hath saide it god saith christ is in the sacrament truly and really present to the soule of a christian carnall senses denie this and naturall reason knoweth not how but aske with the capernaits how can he giue vs his flesh to eate but faith beleeueth it and knoweth how though to outward sense it cannot be expressed and it was a holy and diuine speech vsed by holy martyrs who being asked how christ could be eaten in the sacrament and not with the teeth answered my faith knoweth how god saith wicked man though they flourish neuer so are miserable and good man are blessed aboue all other reason and worldly experience say this is false but true faith belieues it and findes it true for neuer did any childe of god desire to change his estate with the mightiest or wealthiest wicked man in the world god saith he that will follow christ must denie himselfe and his owne desires and follow christ in bitternes and affliction nature saith this is a hard lesson who can beare it but faith beleeues it yeelds to it and endeuours the practice of it because god hath so comaunded such is the power and excellency of true faith fourthly and lastly out of this action and obedience of noah marke a speciall lesson god had reuealed to him that he would saue him and his family and assured him hee should not perish yet for all this he makes an arke wherevpon it followeth that noah though he knew god would saue him yet was perswaded he must vse the meanes or else should not be saued he might haue said to himselfe god hath said and bound himselfe by couenant he will saue me now if i make not the arke yet his word is his word and he will stand to it his will cannot be altred though i be false he will be true though i doe not that i should doe yet he will do what belongs to him therefore i will spare my labour and cost of making the arke especially seeing it is a matter of so much mockerie and so ridiculous to reason but noah is of another minde he will not seuer god word from his meanes he dependeth on god word for his safety but not on his bare word without the meanes whence we learne that though a man be certaine of his saluation yet he is to vse the meanes of saluation and that not onely though he be certaine in the certainty of faith but though hee could be assured from god himselfe by immediate reuelation for if god should say to a man by his name thou shalt be saued it is no more then here was said to noah for his deliuerance for to him said god i will destroy all flesh but with thee i will make my couenant and thou shalt be deliuered yet for all that noah iudgeth that if he vse not the meanes if he make not an arke he is to looke for no deliuerance this was noahs diuinitie contrary both to the diuinitie and practice of some in this age who say if i shall be saued i may liue as i list and though i liue as i list yet if in the end i can say lord haue mercie on me i am safe enough but noah would not trust his body on such conditions though they be so presumptuous as to trust their soules let such man be assured god in his decree hath tied the end and the meanes together let not therfore man separate what god hath ioyned together he that doth let him look for no more saluation if he vse not the meanes then noah would haue done for safety if hee had made no arke and thus wee see the second effect of his faith it followeth to the sauing of his houshold now this second effect of preparing is further inlarged by a particular enumeration of the ends or purposes why the arke was made namely both of god commandement and his obedience in making it the first end which both god had in commaunding and noah in making the arke was the sauing of his houshold that is himself amp all that belonged to him which were his wife his three sonnes and their wiues gen but first of all it may seeme wonderfull how this arke should saue him and his houshold in this generall destruction for it was a great and huge vessell resembling a ship yet so farre vnlike as it is rather called an arke it must flote aboue the water it must be laden with a heauie burthen and yet without anchor to stay her without mast to poise her without sterne to guide and moue her without maister to gouerne her for noah was partly a husbandman and partly a preacher and though he had much learning yet the vse of sayling was not then found out and therefore in all reason this arke would be caried on hills and rockes by the violence of the tempests and so slit in pieces yet for all this it saued him euen when heauen and earth seemed to runne together so vehement was the raine euen then it saued him and his how came this to passe euen because god prouidence and his hand was with it hee was the maister and the steres man for as god himselfe shut the doore of the arke vpon him when he was in and made it fast after him that no water might enter which was impossible for noah himselfe to haue done gen so doubtlesse the same god that had vouchsafed to be his porter was also his keeper and preseruer and the maister of the arke during that voyage and from hence came it to passe that the arke saued him which otherwise in reason it could neuer haue done here wee learne first the speciall and extraordinary presence and prouidence of god ouer his children in great distresses and extremities his prouidence is ouer all his works for he forgets nothing that he made but the speciall eye of his prouidence watcheth ouer his children as a maister of a family hath an eye ouer his meanest servant yes ouer his verie cattell but his care night and day is for his children and as god ouerlooketh all his children alwayes so principally his prouidence sheweth it selfe when they are in the deepest dangers or in the greatest want of naturall helps when daniel was cast into the lions denne god was there with him and shut their mouthes daniel when the three children were cast into the fierie fornace god was with them and tooke away the naturall force from the fire daniel when the israelites were to passe through the sea or else die a hard shift god was with them amp made the sea giue place to his children and stand like two walls on either side them exodus when they were to wander through the wide wildernesse through so many dangers and discomforts as deserts doe afford christ was with them and waited vpo them with his continuall comfort and assistance corinthian and so when noah was to go into the arke and being in must haue the dore shut and closed vpon him his ca e pitifull for doe it himselfe he could not it both being so bi ge that elephants and camels must en er in at it and though he could haue pulld it to yet being within hee could neuer haue sufficiently closed it from the water nor would any other of that wicked world doe it for him they did not owe him so much loue or seruice but rather mockt him amp laught at him as first for making the arke so now for entring in when he knew not how to haue it closed how should hee do himselfe could not others would not god himselfe with his owne hand shut it for him and after when he was in and was in danger to be throwen vpon the rockes and to be split in pieces on the hills and had no anchor no sterne no pilot no maister god himselfe was with him and was all in all vnto him the eye of his loue and the hand of his power was ouer him and so the arke saued him and his houshold such is the prouidence of god ouer his when they are in the deepest distresses amp most destitute of all worldly comforts the vse of this doctrine ministreth comfort vnto god children who as they are sure of strange calamities to fall vpon them so are they sure also of a speciall care of god ouer them euen in their greatest extremities and this may god childre who serue him in y e true obedience of faith euer assure themselues of that the lord doth neuer forget nor forsake them in any of their troubles but will be euer ready with his mercifull hand to defend them from dangers to prouide for them in necessities amp to comfort them in distresses when they know not in the world how to doe elisha had an armie of man sent against him to take him how should one man escape from a whole armie his man cried alas maister how shall we doe hee answered his man and bad him feare not there were more for him then against him that is more angels though they were vnseene for him then there were man in the armie against him and so when no man would shut the door for noah there were angels enow readie sent from god to doe it for him and when all wicked man wished he might perish with the arke he had made amp assured themselues he would perish hauing no such helpes as ship require then the holy angels or rather god himselfe supplied all such wants vnto him and so when themselues perished they sawe him and his houshold saued by that arke and no lesse care hath god ouer his church and children to this day and though hee worketh not visible miracles for them yet they feele and finde that he is oftentimes mighty and wonderfull in preseruing them in prouiding for them in assisting them and in comforting them when else without that prouidence of his they knowe they had miscaried againe whereas god himselfe vouchsafeth in noahs danger to be the master and pilot of this arke that so it may saue him and his houshold we learne the auntientie and dignitie of the trade of mariners saylers and maisters of ship the auntientie for we see it is as old as noah as old as this second world euen yeeres olde the dignitie is great for god himselfe was both the first author and the first practicer of it the author and first deuiser for noah made not this arke of his owne head but as we heard before he was warned of god to doe it and hee was the first practicer for god himselfe performed all those seruices vnto noah in the arke else it had neuer saued him this being so it is the more griefe to see that worthy calling so abused and debased as it is the most of them that practice it being profane vngodly and dissolute man such man should remember god made the first ship and god was the first master and the first mariner the first pilot the first gouernour of a ship and they should labour to be like him this is one of those fewe callings which may say god himselfe was the first deuiser and practicer of it all callings cannot say so why then should they so farre forgette whom they succeede indeede vppon the seas and in distresses they will make some profession of religion but let them come a shore what swearing what whoring what drunkennesse amongst them but let them be afraid to be so profane which hold the place which once god himselfe held or else let them know they are vnworthy of so good a calling and thus we see the reason and the meanes how the ark could saue him and his houshold namely because god did gouerne it in the next place obserue the end and vse of the arke it was to saue this holy man and his houshold learne here that god servant in common calamities haue safety for god himselfe giueth them security and prouideth deliuerance thus was it euer when god proceedeth in iudgement against hierusalem for the sinnes thereof hee marketh the godly in their foreheads namely such as mourne and cry for the abhominations which are done against god ezech when sodome must be destroyed righteous lot and his family must be drawen out nay the angell can doe nothing till he be safe genesis when the destroying angell went ouer the land of egypt and destroyed the first borne in euery house of the egyptians the israelites dwelling amongst them hee past ouer all the israelites whose doores were sprinkled with the bloud of the paschall lambe exodus and euen so hee whose heart and soule is sprinkled with the bloud of iesus christ the lambe of god no calamity can do him hurt nay when others are smitten he shall be deliuered the vse of this doctrine is to our church and state wee haue by god mercy long enioyed peace and the gospell and both vnder a gracious gouernment and with these manie other blessings yet speake truth and the sinnes of our times call for a floud as in noahs time and sure a floud of tribulation must come one way or other for this was alwaies the state of god church now peace now persecution peace abused causeth trouble and calamities therefore as we haue so long had peace and ease so assuredly looke for a floud what it will be or when knoweth no man onely he who will send it the righteous and almighty god how then shall wee doe when the floud of tribulation is vpon vs there is no way but one beleeue in christ iesus settle thy heart in true faith repent of thy sinnes get god fauour and forgiuenesse and then when the floud comes god prouidence shall affoord thee one way or other an arke of safetie and deliuerance sprinkle thy soule now with christes bloud by faith and true repentance and the destroying angell of god wrath shall passe ouer thee and thy houshold thirdly obserue the largenesse of god bounty not onelie noah shall be saued but with him his houshold also why the lord did so there be diverse reasons first for the propagation and multiplication of the world after the floud if any obiect noah and his wife might haue serued for that end i answere they were olde for hee was yeeres olde when the floud came and though hee liued yeeres after the floud genesis yet reade wee not of any children that he had if any further obiect the first world was begun and multiplied by two alone adam amp eue amp no more why then should there be so many for the beginning of the second world i answere god did so in the beginning to shew that all mankinde came of one bloud acts and that in regard of body or birth there is no difference originally between man and man which also was obserued euen in the second beginning for though the world was multiplied by three brother shem cham and iapheth yet those three were not strangers but all sonnes to one man noah so that as at first by adam and eue so after from noah and his wife came all man in the world but in the beginning of the second world there must needes be more lines then one because now the blessed seede was promised whose line and kindred must needes be kept distinct fro all other vntil his incarnation againe there was more cause now why the world should be speedily replenished then at the beginning for first the earth had some glory and beauty left it after the first curse so that it was still a most pleasant and delightfull habitation to adam and eue but now by the second curse in the floud all her beautie was gone she and all her glory was ouerrunne spoyled and defaced so that it had beene a miserable habitation for noah and his wife if they had beene without company secondly the earth being much defaced and the vertue of it almost quite perished by the floud had now more neede to be recouered by the hands and helpe of many mens labours and to this purpose the scripture saith gen amp that the earth was diuided amongst the three sonnes of noah and they liued not all together but ouerspread the earth and least the beast which then were many should ouergrowe the world therefore god would haue the earth speedily replenished amp to that end noah amp his wife had neuer a servant in y e ark but only such as should haue children their sonnes and their wiues and thus the multiplication of mankind is the first cause why god saued noahs children the second cause it is likely that as himselfe was a righteous man so they of his family were more orderly and religious then others of that wicked age for good man make conscience of teaching their families as abraham gen and seeing noah is commended for a iust amp good man doubtlesse he did carefully instruct his houshold amp therefore it is to be supposed that all or the most of them were holy and righteous persons fearing god thirdly though all of them were not righteous yet they were all of the family of righteous noah and therfore for his sake they were saued all being his children or his childrens wiues for the righteous ma procureth blessings not on himself alone but on all that belong vnto him dwel with him or are in his copany at abrahams request had there bin but righteous man in sodome all had beene spared for their sakes gen when ioseph dwelt in egypt all putiphars house and all in it though hee were a heathen man were blessed for iosephs sake gen when lot was deliuered out of sodomes destruction the angels asked him hast thou any sonnes in law that they might haue beene saued for his sake gen when paul and soules with him suffred shipwracke and were all in present danger of drowning god saued paul and for his sake all the rest god gaue him the liues of all that were with him in the ship acts and so here noahs children and their wiues are spared for noahs sake let this encourage all man to serue god in truth and vprightnesse seeing thereby they shall not make themselues alone bles ed but bring downe god blessing euen on their houses children and posterities yes the very places where and the people with whom they dwell shall fare the better for them and thus we see the causes amp reasons why not noah alone but euen his houshold were also saued in the fourth place let vs obserue how the holy ghost saith that noah built the arke not for the sauing of himselfe but of his houshold and it is so said for two causes first to shew that noah though he were the head amp gouernour yet was one of the houshold for in the word houshold himselfe is comprehended maisters and fathers though they be gouernours yet must thinke themselues members of the houshold so will they haue more care thereof when they esteeme themselues members of the body and parts of the whole secondly to teach vs what care noah had for his family euen so great as hee prepared the arke to saue them withall here is an example of a worthy maister of a houshold and yet all this was but for a temporall deliuerance now if hee was so carefull for their bodily safety how much more was he to saue them from hell and damnation which he knew to be an eternall destruction of both soule and body therefore doubtlesse as he was a diligent preacher of righteousnesse to that sinfull world so principal y a diligent preacher and prayer and catechiser of his owne family that so he might make them god servant and deliuer them from the eternall fire of hell noahs example is to be a patterne to all parents and fathers of families to teach them care not onely for the body amp bodily welfare of their families but especially for their soules and spirituall welfare and if they be bound by all bonds of nature and religion to prouide for the body of their children let reason iudge how much more straightly they are tied to looke to their soules but s paul saith he that prouideth not temporall things necessary for his family is worse then an infidel timo then what is he who prouideth nothing for their soules surely his case is extremely fearefull therfore when thou hast prouided meat apparell a calling and mariage house amp liuing for thy child think not thou hast done and so maist turne them off the world may take them thus but god will not take them so at thy hands no the greater duty remaines behind thou must prouide for their soules that they may know god amp feare his name thou must with abraham gen teach thy family that they may walke in the wayes of god i know abraham saith god that he will do it and surely god will know all such as do so by doing thus man shal make their houses churches of god as here noahs was amp it would be far better with our church amp state if man did so ministers in the church amp iustices in the country should haue much lesse to do if maisters of families would do their duties but to goe further let vs see more particularly what this houshold was that was thus saued by the arke first it was a family of foure man amp foure woman not man or woman alone but both and consisting of as many woman as man thus god would haue one sexe to loue another and one to think themselues beholden to the other the beginning of the first world was by one man amp one woman of the second by foure man and foure woman but alwai equall and here also god would teach man not to contemne the other though the weaker sexe for god saued as many of them from the vniuersall floud as he did man secondly how many were they in all but eight persons of the whole world no more were saued a miserable spectacle see what sinne can doe it can bring many millions to eight persons in a short time see what it is to offend god let vs not then glory in our multitudes but glory in this that we know and serue god for otherwise if our sinnes cry out to him against vs he can easily make vs fewe enow thirdly what were these eight persons not one servant amongst them all there were none but noah and his wife his three sonnes and their wiues it is meruailous that here were none of noahs servant some thinke he had none and that the simplicity of those dayes required no attendance but that each one was servant to him selfe and they seem to gather it out of gen where god biddeth noah enter thou amp all thine house into the arke and when they entred they are recounted in the seauenth verse to be none but himselfe his wife and his children therefore say they in noahs house there were no servant but why might not noah haue servant as well as abraham and lot had doubtlesse he had but behold a wonderfull matter noahs owne servant would not beleeue his preaching but chose rather to liue loosely with the world amp perish with it then to liue godly with their maister and be saued with him this was and wil be true in all ages that in a wicked age or in a wicked towne a maister shal not be able to gouerne his owne servant but the streame of common wickednesse and ill examples of other man doth draw them from the obedience of their maisters they can readily alledge for themselues we wil not be vsed more hardly then other mens are we will not be tied to our houres amp bound to so many exercises we will do as others do thus would noahs servant do and perished with the world so hard a thing is it for a good man to haue good servant in such times or places where wickednes raigneth and thus wee haue seene in some sort how the arke saued noah and his houshold and what this houshold of his was now besides this end and vse of the arke we are further to know that whereas this sauing of them was but a corporall deliuerance from a temporall death this arke hath also a spirituall vse which we may not omit for as many of noahs family as were true beleeuers it was a meanes to saue them another way euen to saue their soules for it taught them many things first it was an assurance of god loue vnto their soules for if hee was so carefull to saue their body from the floud they thereby assured themselues hee would be as good vnto their soules which they knew to be farre more pretious and excellent secondly it shewed them how to be saued for as they saw no safety nothing but present death out of the arke so it taught them that out of god church and out of god fauour no saluation could be expected and so it taught them to labour to be in god fauour and members of his true church thirdly they saw they were saued from the floud by faith and obedience for first noah beleeued god word that the floud should come then he obayed god commaundement and made the arke as hee was commaunded and thus he and his by beleeuing amp obaying were saued through the arke and without these the arke could not haue saued them this taught them more particularly how to be saued namely by beleeuing god and obaying god and else no saluation for when they saw their body could not be saued without them it assured them much lesse could their soules be saued without faith and obedience lastly this deliuerance by the arke was a pawn vnto them from god assuring them of saluation if they beleeued in the messias for seeing god so fully performed his promise vnto them for their bodily deliuerance vpon their beleeuing they therby might assure themselues he would performe his promise of saluation vnto them vpon their faith and true obedience moreouer it strengthned their faith for when euer after any promise of god was made vnto them or any word of god came vnto them they then remembred god mercy and faithfulnesse vnto them in their deliuerance by the arke and therefore beleeued vnto these and many other spirituall vses did the arke serue vnto noah and to his houshold as many of them as were beleeuers but what is this to vs indeede the arke serued them for a temporall deliuerance it saued their liues therefore they also had reason to make spirituall vse of it but it saued not vs it serued vs to no vse corporall therefore how can wee make any spirituall vse of it i answere though wee had no corporall vse of the arke yet there ariseth an excellent spirituall vse out of the consideration of it the arke of noah and our baptisme are figures correspondent one to the other that that noahs arke was to them baptisme is to vs thus teacheth s peter to the arke of noah the figure which now saueth vs euen baptisme agreeth the same that s paul here ascribeth to the arke s peter ascribeth to baptisme the arke saued them baptisme saueth vs now the resembla ce between these two figures hath two branches first as it was necessary for them that should be saued in the floud to be in the arke and out of the arke no possibility to escape so is it for them that will haue their soules saued to be in christ and of his church they must be mysticall members of christ and visible members of his church and out of christ and his church no possibility of saluation that this is true for christ s peter proueth apparantly acts among man there is no name giuen vnder heauen whereby to be saued but the name of iesus christ neither is there saluation in any other and that this is true for the church he prooueth acts the lord added to the church daily such as should be saued see how such as are to be saued must ioyne themselues to the church when they see where it is and all this is signified amp taught in baptisme for the outward vse of baptisme makes vs members of the visible church amp the inward amp powerfull vse of baptisme makes vs members of christ himselfe the vse and consideration hereof should make vs all more carefull to be true members of christ amp of his church by making not onely a bare profession of religion but by seeking to be incorporate into christ by faith and true repentance for this must saue vs when nothing els can as they that were out of the arke no gold nor siluer could buy out their safetie no lands nor liuings no houses nor buildings no hilles nor mountaines nothing in the world nor the whole world it selfe could saue them but being out of the arke they perished so if a man be out of christ amp out of his church no gold nor siluer no honour nor glory no wit nor policy no estimation nor authoritie no friend nor fauour no wisdome nor learning no hilles of happines nor mountaines of gold can saue his soule but hee must perish in the flood of god eternall wrath for as it prooued folly in them that trusted to their high houses or catcht hold on the hils if they were out of the arke so will it prooue much greater folly to them that shall trust to any meanes of saluation if they be out of christ and contrariwise as they that were in the arke were sure to bee saued doe the water windes and weathers stormes and tempests all they could so that still the more the water rose the arke rose also and was euer higher than they and the higher it was carried by the violence of the water the safer it was from the danger of hils and rockes and so in the midst of danger they were out of danger and were saued in the midst of the water so he that is once truely in christ is sure of saluation nothing can hinder it flouds of calamities may assault him and humble him but they hurt not his saluation hee is in the arke he is in christ nay the gates of hell shall not ouerthrowe him but through all the waues of the diuels malice amp through all tempests of temptations the blessed arke of christes loue and merits shall carrie him vp and at last conuay him to saluation this is the blessed assurance of all them that are truely baptized into christ but as for such as out of their prophanenesse either care not to be in christ or contemne baptisme let the assure theselues they be out of the arke amp they perish certainly this is the part of the resemblance the second is this noahs body going into the arke hee seemed therein a dead man going into a graue or a tombe to be buried for he was buried in the arke amp the arke in the water amp he depriued of the fresh air amp gladsome light yet by god appointment it was the means to saue noah which in all reason seemed to be his graue amp if noah will be saued he must goe into this graue so they that will escape hell and damnation by christ the true arke of holinesse must be buried and mortified in their flesh and fleshly lusts and there is no way to come to life euerlasting but this for thy soule cannot liue whilst thy sinnes the olde man that is thy corruptions doe liue but they must die amp be buried and then thy soule liueth and whilst they liue thy soule is dead and farre from the life of grace which is in christ iesus all this is affirmed at large in romanes where we may see apparantly that we must by baptisme die with christ amp be buried with him else we cannot be saued by him our corruptions our sinnes which are the olde man must die and be buried that the new man that is the grace and holines of christ may liue in vs and our soules by it amp he that thus dieth not neuer liues amp he that thus is not buried neuer riseth to true life thus mortification of sin is the way to heauen and death the way of life eternall amp he that is not thus mortified in his corruption let him neuer looke to be quickned to grace or glory if this be so we may then see what a miserable world we now liue in wherin mortification of sin is a thing vnknown not a man of many that can tell what it is nay grace is dead and holinesse is mortified and i feare buried also but the old man raignes corruption liues and sinne flourisheth mortifying of christ by our sinnes is common but mortifying of sinne is sildome seene for christ is betrayed crucified and killed in a sort by the sinnes of man what a fearefull change is this christ should liue in vs and we endeuour to crucifie him againe sinne should be crucified but it liueth in vs but if wee will haue christ to saue vs then must wee mortifie the body of our sinne for he that will liue when he is dead must die while he is aliue and he that will be saued by his baptisme must looke that baptisme worke this effect in him to make him die and be buried with christ that afterwards hee may rise and raigne with christ and then shall baptisme saue vs as the arke saued faithfull noah and his houshold and thus much for the first end amp vse of the arke the second followed here is the second end why noah prepared the arke to the condemnation of the world that then was for by it not by his faith as some would reade it he condemned that wicked generation both to a temporall destruction of their body and to an eternall iudgement in hell in the words there are two points to be considered for the first it may be asked what is meant by the world s peter answereth ep the world of the vngodly that is that generation of sinfull man who liued in the dayes of noah whom also in the epistle hee calleth disobedient and their more particular sinnes are disclosed and recorded by moses gen to be monstrous abuse of holy mariage vnnaturall lusts cruelties and oppressions an vtter neglect of god seruice and sabbaoth and an extreame prophanenesse and dissolutenesse in euery kinde and this corruption was not priuate or personall but vniuersall through all estates sexes and ages this world of the vngodly this whole race of wicked and disobedient man were condemned but how was that world condemned by noah thus god vouchsafed them yeeres to repent in and appointed noah to preach vnto them during that time to call them to repentance but they beleeued not god nor noah but continued in their disobedience and grew in their vngodlinesse therefore when that time was expired god performed his word spoken by noah brought the floud vpon them destroyed them all and condemned in hell as many of them as died in impenitencie and vnbeliefe and thus that wicked world was condemned according as noah in his ministerie had foretold them here we may learne first what the world of this age is to looke for vnlesse there be repentance for to speake but of our selues in this nation haue not we had the gospell yeeres and more and with it peace and much prosperity haue not we had a goodly time giuen vs to repent what is our duty but with reuerence to see and acknowledge this goodnesse of god to take hold of this merciful opportunity this time of grace and this day of saluation if wee doe not and make no account of the gospell what can we looke for but to be condemned as that world was looke at the meanes and opportunities which these dayes affoord and they be as golden dayes as euer were since christs or as euer can be expected till his comming againe but looke at the profanenesse and carnality and security of this age euen ouer all christendom and this is the iron age these be the euill dayes and so euill as nothing can be expected but a river of brimstone and a floud of fire to purge it the dayes of the comming of the son of man which i take to be these dayes shall be like saith christ math vnto the dayes of noah and surely in security and profanenesse they are like and therefore in all reason they must be like in punishment wee must therefore take warning by them and shake off this security which possesseth all mens hearts and waite for the lord in watching and prayer and thinke euery day may be the last day of this world at least the last day of our liues and let vs prepare for it and liue in the expectation of it otherwise if our sinfulnesse growe on a little further nothing can we looke for but to be condemned in an vniuersall iudgement as that world was let vs therefore be take our selues to a more serious seruing of god that the lord when he commeth may finde vs so doing secondly in that the whole world that then was was thus destroyed and condemned and as wee heard afore onely noah and his houshold saued wee learne that it is not good nor safe to follow the multitude noah was here a man alone he held and beleeued against all the world and yet his iudgement and his beliefe was true and all the worlds false and accordingly he saued when they were all condemned it is meruaile therefore the church of rome should so much stand vpon numbers and multitude for the gracing of of their religion for it euer was and euer will be a weake argument if multitudes might euer haue beene alledged then vnto noah especially to whom it might haue beene said who article thou that pretendest to be wiser then all man and to know more then all the world thou that hast a faith by thy selfe and hast no man to beare thee company thinke not that all adams posterity all the children of holy henoch and methusalem are all deceiued but thy selfe alone would not these and such like obiections haue discouraged any man yet behold the force of faith noah had god word for it and therefore beleeueth against all the world and is commended to all ages for this faith it is therefore but a vaine flourish of the papists to presse vs so much with their multitudes and vniuersality and consent and vnity and succession amp cotinuance for all this is worth nothing as long as they first proue not that that doctrine or opinion which these multitudes hold hath his ground from god word till then all the other is vanity for it is better with noah to haue god plaine word of his side then to beleeue otherwise with all the world which was here deceiued amp condemned when noah alone beleeued god word and was saued and thus we see who were condemned the world to end this point one question may not vnprofitably be here moued whether was all the world that is all the man in that world condemned or no the words seeme to imply that all but noah were and yet it may seeme strange that of so many millions none should repent but he and if they repented why were they not saued i answere the world of that wicked age was condemned two wayes first with a corporall destruction and so they were all condemned without exception no high houses no hilles no deuises of man could saue them for the water rose cubits aboue the tops of the highest mountaines vnder heauen gen and so though till then diverse of them liued by flying to the hilles yet that being their last refuge and being thus taken from them then all flesh perished that moued vpon the earth and euery man and euery thing that drew the breath of life for so saith the story genesis and it is but vaine to imagine that any of them could be saued vpon that arke for first it was so made with a ridge in the top as is most probably thought that no man could stand vpon it much lesse make any stay in that violent tossing by tempests againe if they could yet could they not haue liued so long for want of foode the water being almost a yeere vpon the earth and thus it is most certaine they all without exception were destroyed with bodily destruction but secondly they were condemned to an eternall destruction in hell and therefore s peter saith their spirits are now in prison who were disobedient in the dayes of noah now all the question is whether were they all condemned or no i answere for ought that we certainly knowe out of the scripture they were all condemned yet in the iudgement of charity wee are not so to thinke and the rather because there are many probable coniectures that some of them repented for howsoeuer many of them beleeued not noah iudging that he spake of his owne head yet it is more then likely that when they saw it begin to raine extraordinarily at least when they saw themselues driuen to the tops of the hilles and there looked hourely for death that then diverse of the posterity of henoch and methusalem and lamech were ashamed of their former vnbeliefe and then turned to god in faith and in repentance and doubtlesse that is the onely or the principall cause why god brought the floud in fourty dayes which he could haue done in foure houres that so man might haue time to repent genesis but it will be saide if any repented why then were they not saued i answer because they repented not in time when they were called by noahs preaching repentance is neuer too late to saue the soule from hell but it may be too late to saue the body from a temporal iudgement and this i take it is that that wee may safely hold for it seemes too hard to condemne all the posterity of methusalem henoch lamech and other holy patriarks who as the text saith begat sonnes and daughters and to thinke that none of them repented when they saw the floud come indeede as noah had said it cannot be but they heard their fathers preach and why might not that preaching worke vpon their hearts when the iudgement came though afore it did not but why then did not god record in the scripture neither their repentance nor saluation but hath left it so doubtfull i answere for the very same for which he would not record adams nor salomons all for this cause that he might teach all man to the worlds end what a fearefull thing it is to disobay his commandement as adam did or to defer repentance when they are called by god word as these man did therefore to feare vs from the like though afterwards they repented it pleased god not to record it but to leaue it doubtfull this question being thus discussed yeelds vs two strong motiues to repentance first for if we repent not betime our state then is fearefull and doubtfull though not desperate as wee see here the saluation euen of methushelas children is doubtfull for they repented not when they were called but deferred it till the iudgement came so if we deferre our repentance till our death there is great question of our saluation but let vs repent when wee are called by god word and then it is out of question then there is no doubt of our saluation secondly if we repent betime we shall escape the temporall iudgement which god sends vpon the world for sinne if not but deferre repentance till the iudgement come we may then by it saue our soules but our body shall perish in the vniuersall iudgement if the children of henoch and methushelah which were neere a kinne vnto noah had repented at noahs preaching they had beene saued with noah they did not but when the floud came indeede then doubtlesse they beleeued with noah and wished themselues in the arke with him but it was too late they saued their soules but were drowned with the rest so assuredly when god threatneth any iudgement on our church or nation they that beleeue and repent betime shall escape it but they that will liue in wantonnesse with the world and not repent till god begin to strike if then they doe when the floud is come though saluation cannot be denied to repentance whensoeuer yet let them assure themselues they shall beare their part with the world in the punishment as they did partake with them in their sinnes let then these two considerations moue vs all to turne to god by timely repentance then shall we be sure to escape both the eternall and temporall iudgement and not be condemned as here this world of the vngodly was and thus we see who were condemned the second point is whereby were they condemned the text saith onely by which hee condemned ampc whereupon some would vnderstand faith and reade it thus by which faith he condemned the world which though it be true for the faith of holy man condemnes the vnbeleeuing and misbeleeuing world yet is it not proper in this place where the arke is described by the vses of it which are two whereof this is one and besides that the greeke construction doth well beare it the iudgement of almost all interpreters referres it to the arke and further in all reason that that saued him and his houshold condemned the world also but the arke is said to haue saued them therefore by it hee condemned the world neither is this any derogation but a commendation of faith for by faith he made that arke which arke condemned the world now by the arke noah condemned the world two wayes by his obedience in building it by his preaching in building it for the first god bad noah build an arke so great and to such an vse as in all reason no man would haue done it yet noah by the power of his faith beleeued god word and obayed and therefore builded the arke this faith and this obedience of noah to this commaundement of god condemned the vnbeleeuing and disobedient world and made them without excuse so saith christ the niniuites who beleeued at the preaching of ionas shall rise in iudgement against the iewes and condemne them because they repented not at christs preaching and the queene of saba who came so farre to heare salomon shall condemne them who then would not heare christ math euen so noahs obedience shall condemne them for noah being told of a miraculous thing and beleeuing it and being commaunded so vnreasonable a thing as the making of the arke and obaying shall condemne that wicked world who would not beleeue god ordinarie promises nor obay his ordinarie and most holy commaundements and as the saints are said to condemne the world corinthian by being witnesses against them and approuers of god iust sentence so noahs fact and faith condemned that world and thus we see it is apparant that the obedience and godly examples of good man doe condemne the vngodly the vse whereof is to encourage vs all to imbrace christian religion and not be daunted by the scornes or other euill behauiours of profane man which cannot abide the gospell for he that walketh in the way of holinesse and keepeth good conscience in the midst of a wicked generation if his godlinesse doe not ouercome their euill and conuert them it shall more demonstrate their wickednesse and condemne them our church is full of mockers and they discourage many from christ amp religion but let them know this will be the end of it their obedience whom they contemne and laugh at wil be their condemnation and thus noah by his obedience in building the ark condemned the world secondly so did he also by his preaching as he builded it for the building of the arke was a part of his propheticall ministerie the prophets preached two wayes in word amp in action for beside their verball preaching and deliuering of god word they preached in their liues and actions especially in such actions as were extraordinarie and such was noahs building of the arke it was an actuall preaching yes euery stroke vpon the arke was a loud sermon to the eyes and eares of that wicked world for by making it he signified some should be saued and the rest drowned namely all that would beleeue and repent should be saued in it and all that would not shold out of it be drowned amp because they beleeued not this therefore by it he condemned them from this ground we may learn first that a man may be a true and sincere minister lawfully called by god and his church and yet not turne many vnto god nor by his ministerie bring many to repentance for here noah a prophet called immediatly yet in yeeres preaching both in word and action he cannot turne one to faith and repentance a most fearefull thing if we well consider it that both by preaching and making the arke hee should not turne one of the sonnes of lamech methushelah or henoch to beleeue him but that they should all rather chuse to be misled in the generall vanity of that wicked world then to serue god with noah this was a most discomfortable thing vnto him as could be yet this hath beene the case and lot of many holy prophets esay must goe and preach vnto them and yet his doctrine must harden their hearts that they may not be saued esay and ezekiel must goe and speake and yet is tolde aforehand they will not heare him nor repent ezek and when s paul himselfe preached vnto the iewes at rome some beleeued not acts there is nothing will more discourage a man and cast downe his heart then to see that his labours are not onely in vaine but doe take a contrarie effect that whereas they were bestowed to haue saued them they are meanes of their deeper condemnation therefore as when their labours bring man to god they may greatly reioyce and account those people as s paul did the thessalonians his crowne his ioy and glory so when they doe no good as noah here but that man are worse and worse this must humble and abase them in themselues amp let them know the power and vertue is not in them but god so saith s paul to the vngodly amp impenitent amongst the corinthians i feare saith he when i come my god abase me amongst you amp i shall bewaile many of them which haue sinned amp not repented and surely this or nothing wil abase a minister amp minister matter of great bewailing yet not so but as stil there is matter of true cofort amp cotetment vnto all godly amp faithful teachers for whether thy labour be the sauour of life vnto life or of death vnto death to thy hearers it is to god a sweet sauour in christ againe we may here learne that those who are condemned before god haue their condemnation by the preaching of the word the secrets of all the world saith the apostle shall be iudged by iesus christ according to the gospell and heere the preaching of noah and his actuall preaching by preparing the arke condemnes the world such is the power and might of the ministerie of god word vpon all them that resist it which being so should teach all man when they come to heare god word to submit themselues to the power of it to obay it and become penitent for otherwise so many sermons as a man heareth so many inditements are presented to god against him and if at the last day there were no diuels to accuse those bills of inditements would both accuse and condemne him and this iudgement is begun in this life as their consciences doe often tell them and is accomplisht at the last day for there is no dallying with god word if it cannot saue it ki ls it is the fire which if it cannot soften it hardens let then all impenitent man make conscience to obay god word for if now they abuse it it will be euen with them both here and in another world for as the very same arke which saued noah and his houshold condemned the world so the same word of god which beleeued and obayed by godly man is their saluation disobayed and refused by vngodly man shall be their condemnation and thus much for the two ends why noah prepared the arke amp consequently of the second effect of noahs faith it followeth and was made heire of the righteousnesse which i by faith here is the third and last effect whereby the excellencie of noahs faith is commended it made him an heire and that not of the world for so he was besides but of that that the world could not yeeld of righteousnesse and that of the best of all euen of that righteosnesse which is by faith these words haue relation to that testimonie which god gaue of noah in genesis noah was a iust and vpright man and walked with god now that which is spoken there more generally is here particularly opened and vnfolded he was iust or righteous how hee was righteous by the righteousnesse of faith so that these words are a commentarie vnto the other but because that that is here affirmed of noah is a most glorious thing his faith made him an heire that is made him that was heire of all the earth a better heire therefore these words are to be well waighed for their full opening three points are to be considered what is the righteousnesse here spoken of why it is called the righteousnesse of faith or by faith how noah was made heire of it by his faith for the first that righteousnesse by which noah and all holy man are to stand righteous before god is not a righteousnesse of any nature but such a one as is appointed of god for that purpose that wee may knowe it the more distinctly wee must examine the seuerall kindes thereof righteousnesse is of two sorts created vncreated vncreated is that which is in god and hath no beginning nor ending no meanes nor measure of this speaketh the prophet psalm righteous article thou o lord this cannot make any man righteous for two reasons first for the godhead and it are all one it is in god essentially a man is one thing and his righteousnesse is another but god and his righteousnesse are all one and therefore it is as impossible for any man to haue this righteousnes as it is to be god secondly it is infinite and mans soule a finite creature and therefore not capable of any thing that is infinite and consequently not of the vnmeasurable righteousnes which is in the godhead therefore this we must leaue vnto god as proper to the deitie created righteousnesse is that which god frameth in the reasonable creature man and angels of angels we are not to speake though theirs and mans differd not much in nature at their creations created righteousnesse of man is of sorts legall or euangelicall legall righteousnesse is that which the morall law prescribeth euangelicall that which the gospell hath reuealed of legall righteousnesse i finde there are three sorts spoken of one that is a perfect righteousnesse one that is a ciuill righteousnesse one that is an inward righteousnesse perfect righteousnesse legall is the perfect fulfilling of the law in a mans owne selfe and by this shall no man liuing be iustified before god for no man since the fall of adam is able perfectly to fulfill the law if any can then shall he be righteous by it but none did nor euer can therefore no man shall stand righteous by perfect legall righteousnesse in himselfe some will obiect but a regenerate man may for he is restored by grace therefore though by adams fall a man is disabled yet by regeneration hee is inabled to fulfill the law perfectly i answere it were so if they were perfectly sanctified in their regeneration but they are sanctified but in part and it is not perfect vntill death obiect thess we are sanctified throughout spirit soule and body if all those what then remaines vnsanctified therefore our sanctification is perfect i answere it is perfect in parts but not in measure nor degree as a childe is a perfect man in all the parts of a man but not in the quantitie of anie part so a childe of god is perfectly sanctified in all parts but not in the measure of any part vntill flesh and mortality and corruption haue an end secondly some may obiect the virgine mary sinned not i answere so teacheth indeede the church of rome that she neuer sinned that her life was free from sinne ctuall and her conception from sinne originall but so taught neither the scripture nor god church but contrariwise it is more then manifest shee was a sinner for first she confesseth her soule reioiced in god her sauiour but if she were no sinner she stoode in neede of no sauiour againe she died but if she had not sinned she should in iustice not haue died for death entred by sinne and where no sinne is there death is not due thus no man can be righteous by the perfect righteousnesse of the law in himselfe secondly there is a ciuill righteousnesse and that is when a man in his outward actions is conformable to the law especially to the commaundements of the second table for example hee is free from the outward actions of murther adultery or theeuery and such like or he can refraine his anger and ouercome his passions that they shall not break out into open violence to the view of the world and for the first table he comes to the church amp professeth religion all this is a ciuill righteousnesse and by this can no man be iustified nor made righteous for first it is not a perfect but a most imperfect righteousnesse and therefore cannot iustifie it is so imperfect that it is as good as none at all in god sight for it is but an outward and constrained and dissembled obedience and wants the inward and true obedience of the heart and soule secondly it cannot make a man righteous for wicked man haue it which are vnrighteous and cannot be saued haman hated mordecay in his heart yes his heart boyled in malice against him yet the story saith that neuerthelesse he refrained himselfe till he came home ester and therefore christ saith that except our righteousnesse exceede the righteousnesse of the scribes and pharisies we cannot enter into the kingdome of heauen math now what was theirs but an outward ciuill righteousnesse whereby they kept the law onely in outward actions as appeareth in that christ afterward in the same chapter expounding the law doth reduce it to the inward which is to his full and proper sense so then yet wee haue not found that righteousnesse which may make a man righteous thirdly there is a righteousnesse called the inward righteousnesse of a christian man which is this a man hauing repented and his sinnes being forgiuen hee is by the holy ghost sanctified inwardly in his soule and all the parts amp powers of it this sanctification is called inward righteousnesse now the church of rome saith a man may be iustified by this but it is not so as appeares by these reasons first this righteousnesse is in this life imperfect and that is proued by the apostle where he saith vvee doe here knowe but in part corinthian therefore our vnderstanding is but in part regenerate and as it so consequently all other parts or powers of our soule are but in part regenerate and in them all we are partly spirit and partly flesh galath therefore if our sanctification be imperfect it cannot iustifie vs againe this righteousnesse is mingled with sinne and vnrighteousnesse and from this mixture comes the combat between the flesh and the spirit spoken of galath for these two are contrary one to the other if it be mingled with sinne then it cannot make vs righteous no nor the works of grace that come from it though god in mercy reward them and though as s iames saith they iustifie our faith and make vs iust before man iames yet can they not iustifie vs before god iustice nor at the barre of the last iudgement will they passe for payment s paul saith corinthian i know nothing by my selfe yet am i not thereby iustified that is i haue so walked in my calling since i was an apostle and minister of the gospell as i am not priuie nor guilty to my selfe of any negligence therein if he dare not stand to that to be iustified by i who dare take hold when he refuseth againe no man can doe any perfect good workes vnlesse hee be perfectly iust for how can perfection come out of imperfection but no man can be perfectly iust in this sinfull body as is proued in the first reason therfore his works here in this life cannot be such as may make him righteous but it may be obiected though our workes haue some defects in them yet god mercy accepts them for righteous and iust and therefore they may iustifie vs i answere as god mercy accepts them so must his iustice be satisfied also but they being imperfect cannot satisfie his iustice for god infinite iustice requires perfect satisfaction but as for our best workes as they are done by vs weigh them in the balance of god iustice and they are so light as they deserue damnation yet in god mercy in christ their defects are couered and they are reputed good workes and are rewarded but we incroach vpon god mercy and abuse his iustice if therefore wee imagine they should deserue god mercy or be able to iustifie vs in his sight thus then seeing legall righteousnesse faileth vs let vs come to euangelicall euangelicall righteousnesse is that that is reuealed in the gospell and should neuer haue beene reuealed if that of the law could haue saued vs but when it not by defect in it but default in our selues could not then god in mercy affordeth vs another in the gospell euangelicall righteousnesse is that that is in christ iesus his it is that must make a man righteous before god but this christ was an extraordinary person consisting of two natures godhead manhood and accordingly hee hath a double righteousnesse in his holy person first as he is god he hath in his nature the righteousnesse of god and that is vncreated and infinite and therefore incommunicable and so none is nor can be righteous by it secondly there is in christ a righteousnesse of his humanity and this though it be finite and created yet is it beyond measure in comparison of the righteousnesse of man or angell so saith s john god giueth not him the spirit by measure this righteousnesse of christ as man or mediator consisteth in two things in the purity of his nature in the perfection of his obedience the first branch of our mediators righteousnesse is the holinesse of his humanity which was perfectly sanctified in his conception by the powerfull operation of the godhead and this was done at the first instant of his conception in the virgin wombe from this purity of nature proceeded his obedience which was as perfect as his nature was pure and so pure a nature made a plaine way to perfect obedience and therefore as his conception was free from sinne originall so was his whole life from the least sinne actuall now the mediators obedience was double actiue amp passiue and both these he performed in his owne person his passiue obedience was his passion or suffering of whatsoeuer the iustice of god had inflicted on man for sinne whether for soule or body the actiue obedience of the mediators person was his perfect fulfilling of the morall law in all duties to god or man in thought word or deede and all this for vs in our steade and on our behalfe and here is true righteousnesse for where the nature of anie person is perfectly pure and the obedience perfect the righteousnesse of that person is perfect and i saye all this was done by him for vs hee suffered all that wee should haue suffered and suffered not hee did that which wee should haue done and did not and this is that righteousnesse by which a sinner is made righteous before god for seeing legall cannot it is this that must and now wee haue found that righteousnesse by which noah and all holy man were made and counted righteous namely that that is resident in the holy person of iesus christ the mediator and yet this is aboue and beyond all reason that one should be iustified by anothers righteousnesse and the doctrine though it be of god and grounded neuer so strongly on god word yet hath it enemy and is mightily oppugned by the church of rome therefore let vs first proue it and then answere the obiections to the contrarie wee proue it thus first from plaine scripture corinthian hee that knew no sinne was made sinne for vs that we might be made the righteousnesse of god in him what can be said plainer he was made sinne for vs and wee righteousnesse by him therefore as christ was no sinner in his owne person but our sinnes were laid vpon him and so he was made a sinner by our sins so though we be not righteous in our owne persons yet hauing hrists righteousnesse imputed to vs we are made righteous by his righteousnesse againe the righteousnesse that must saue vs must be the righteousnesse of man and god as in the aforenamed place it is said that wee might be made the righteousnesse of god in christ but no mans owne righteousnesse can make him the righteousnesse of god nor can god righteousnesse be the righteousnesse of man therefore it remaineth that onely christ being both god and man hath in him that righteousnesse which may make a man the righteousnesse of god thirdly the scripture saith christ is the end of the law to all that beleeue rom the end of the law that is not the taker away or abrogater of the law but the fulfiller of it as the abrogater of the ceremonial so the fulfiller of the morall law if he fulfilled the law for whom was it not for himself for as the messiah was not slain for himself daniel so he obayed not the law for himselfe for whom then for all that beleeue therefore christ doing it for them they fulfill the law in christ and so christ by doing and they by beleeuing in him that doth it doe fulfill the law now if it be not amisse to say we doe in christ fulfill the law no more is it to say wee are made righteous by christes righteousnesse though it be his and not ours but onely by faith let vs then see in the second place what the church of rome obiect against it they first obiect thus as a man cannot be wise by another mans wisedome nor rich by another mans riches nor strong by another mans strength so can he not be righteous by another mans righteousnesse i answer the comparison is not alike for one man hath no propriety in another mans wisedome strength or riches but we haue a right and proprietie in christes righteousnesse againe the wisedome of one man cannot be the wisedom of another because they are two persons fully and equally distinct but it is not so between christ and a sinner for euery beleeuer is spiritually and yet truly and really conioyned to christ and they make one mysticall body christ being the head and euery true beleeuer being a member of that body and therefore that which is his righteousnesse may be also truly ours his because it is in him and ours because we are knit to him for by reason of this mysticall vnion between him and vs all blessings of saluation in him as in the head are diffused into vs as his members or branches amp yet are as properly still in him as is the braine in the head of a man and thus though in sense and reason this cannot be yet by faith and god spirit the righteousnesse of christ is made ours secondly they obiect if this be so then god iustifieth wicked man but god will not doe so it is against the nature of his holinesse and iustice and againe hee that iustifieth the wicked is abhominable to god prou therefore god will not doe so himselfe we answere the ground is good but the collection is vntrue god will not iustifie a wicked man that is true but that therefore a man cannot be iustified by christs righteousnesse is false for god doth not iustifie him that lieth rotting in his former sinnes and weltring in his olde corruption but him that beleeueth in christ and repenteth of his sinnes and that man in his faith is iustified and in his repentance sanctified and so he is made a new man yes as s paul saith he that is in christ is a new creature corinthian for as it is in the first conuersion god turneth nor saueth no man against his will but first makes him willing by his owne work alone and then conuerteth and saueth him with his owne free will working together with god grace so is it in the work of iustification god iustifieth no wicked man but makes him first iust and righteous in and by christ and then accounts him so but then will some say the sinner hath no righteousnesse but that of christs and that is in christ and not in himselfe therefore he hath none in his owne person how then can he be any thing but a wicked man still i answer that is not true that is first affirmed the beleeuing sinner hath more righteousnes then that that is in christ that which iustifieth him is in christes person but the sinner when he is iustified is also sanctified by the mighty work of god grace and so he is made a holy man and doth good and holy workes because he is in christ though his sanctification be imperfect to this end saith s peter acts faith purifieth a mans heart for it is impossible a man should beleeue and so be iustified but hee must also be sanctified in his heart and life thus a sinner is iustified by christs righteousnesse inherent in christ himselfe and sanctified by christs righteousnes diffused from christ into the sinner and therfore his iustificatio is perfect because that that iustifieth him is still in christ but his sanctification imperfect because that that sanctifieth vs is in our selues the one imputed to vs the other infused and inherent againe i answere that if we take it in the sense of scripture it is true that god iustifieth a wicked man for s paul saith rom to him that worketh not but beleeueth in him that iustifieth the vngodly his faith is counted to him for righteousnesse see god iustifieth the vngodly but how euen as we heard before not him that is vngodly after but afore he be iustified him that by nature and in himselfe is vngodly god iustifieth by working in him faith and repentance by which of an vngodly man he is made a man iustified and sanctified their last obiection is if a sinner be righteous by christs righteousnesse then christ is a sinner by his sinnes for ther is the same reason of both but christ is no sinner but the holy of holiest and s paul saith he knew no sinne corinthian and himself for himselfe chalengeth his enemy which of you can reproue me of sinne if then our sins cannot make him a sinner no more can his righteousnesse make vs righteous i answer here we graunt all if they speake the words of the scripture in the sense of the scripture for christ was a true and reputed sinner in the sight of god iustice as hee that becomes surety for another is a debter in his roome or as he that vndertakes for a man body for body must answer for him his owne body for his so in all reason and iustice christ though hee had no sinnes of his owne yet being our surety and vndertaking for vs and standing in our steade our sinnes are iustly accounted his and as for these places amp many more like they are all vnderstood of personall sins from all which and the least contagion thereof he was perfectly free and therefore the same place that saith he knew no sin that is in amp for his owne person knew not what sinne was saith also that for vs amp in our stead he was made euen sin it selfe that we might be made the righteousnesse of god in him thus christ in himselfe more righteous then all man amp angels in our steade is a reputed sinner and by the same reason we most vnrighteous in our selues are clothed with christs righteousnesse and thereby are reputed righteous and as christ though no sinner in himselfe by being a sinner in our steade and hauing our sinnes imputed vnto him became subiect to the wrath of god and bare it euen to death it self so we though not righteous of our selues yet hauing christs righteousnesse imputed to vs are made thereby partakers of god loue and for the worthinesse of that righteousnesse of his so made ours shall be glorified in heauen and thus now at last we haue found that true and that only righteousnesse which can make a man as it did noah righteous in god sight now it remaines to make vse of it first here wee learne how foulely our nature is defiled with sinne and stayned with corruption the staine whereof cannot be washed away with all the water in the world no nor with the bloud of all creatures no not couered with the righteousnesse of all man and angels but onely with the righteousnesse of god and that son of god also if he will apply that righteousnesse vnto vs and make it effectuall must become man and liue and die and rise againe for vs a meruailous thing is it and orthy of our often consideration that all the angels and man in the world cannot make one sinner righteous but that god son must needes doe it and that our sinnes are so hideous as nothing can hide the filthinesse thereof from the eyes of god iustice but onely the glorious mercy seate of christs righteousnesse this may therefore teach vs how to esteeme of our selues and our owne natures furthermore see here the great goodnesse of god to man god put perfect legall righteousnesse in adams heart in his creation he receiued it for himselfe and vs and lost it for himself and vs god in mercy purposing to restore man thus by himselfe lost and cast away giues him another and a better righteousnesse then before but because he saw man was so ill a keeper of his owne iewels he trusts not him with it but sets that righteousnesse in the person of christ iesus and commits it to him to keepe who as he truly knowes the full value and excellencie thereof and as he deerely loues vs so he will most safely keepe it for vs and clothe vs with it in his fathers presence at the last day a point of vnspeakable comfort to god children to consider that their saluation is not in their owne keeping where it might againe be lost but in a safe hand where they shall be sure to finde and haue it when they haue most need of it and to remember that their righteousnesse being in christ they cannot lose it for though they sinne and so lose often the comfort of a good conscience for a time yet they then lose not their righteousnesse which is then in christ and to consider that when in this world they sustaine losses or iniuries or lose all they haue vpon the earth that yet their righteousnesse the riches of their soules is then in heauen full safe in christs keeping and shall neuer be lost this should make vs learne to know christ more and more and to giue him the loue and affections of our very hearts that so we may be able to say with blessed paul timoth i know whom i haue beleeued and i am perswaded that he is able to keepe that which i haue committed vnto him against that day lastly if there be such a communion between christ and a beleeuer that our sinnes were made his and his righteousnesse made ours this may teach vs patience and minister vs comfort in all outward afflictions or inward temptations because it is certaine all our sufferings are his and hee is touched with all the wrongs done to vs when hee was in heauen he calls to saul acts saul saul why persecutest thou me and at the last day math whatsoeuer either good or euill was done to any of his children he saith was done to himselfe and accordingly it shall be rewarded as done to him and thus wee haue taught that true righteousnesse which iustifies a sinner and made noah righteous and we see the vse of that worthy doctrine and in this first point we haue the longer insisted because it is one of the fundamentall points of christian religion hetherto of the first point namely what that righteousnesse is which is here spoken of the point to be cosidered in these words is that this righteousnesse is that righteousnesse which is by faith it is so called because faith is the proper instrument created in the soule of man by the holy ghost to apprehend that righteousnesse which is in the person of christ nor can it be any waies else either apprehended or applied and therefore it is worthily called that righteousnesse which is by faith that is which by faith is made a mans owne or whereunto a man hath title by his faith here therefore two points offer themselues to our obseruation for the first it is proued by apparant euidences of scripure s paul tells the galathians they receiued the promise of the spirit by faith and s john saith that as manie as receiued christ to them hee gaue power to be called the sonnes of god and least any man should thinke that to receiue christ is not to beleeue in christ he addeth euen to as many as beleeue in his name john and therefore faith is fitly compared to a hand that takes hold on a garment and applieth it to the body being naked or to a beggars hand that takes or receiues a kings almes so faith in a mans soule takes hold on christs righteousnes which is the mercifull and liberall almes of the king of heauen and applieth it to the poore and naked soule of the beleeuer if any man aske how can faith apply christ to the beleeuer i answer as a man being in his corrupt nature hath nothing to doe with christ so contrariwise when the holy ghost hath wrought faith in his heart by a supernaturall operation then wee are to know that as faith is the proper instrument to apprehend christ so is christ and his righteousnesse the proper obiect for faith to work vpo for though it apprehend amp apply all other promises which god makes to our soules or body yet most properly and principally and in the first place it apprehends the promise of saluation and the righteousnesse of christ now for the particular manner how faith doth thus we are to know that though it be spirituall amp inuisible and so not easily expressed to sense yet is it done as properly by faith as a garment is by the hand taken and applied to the body or a plaister to a sore if any aske further but when may a man know whether his faith haue apprehended and applied christs righteousnesse to his soule or no i answere when hee beleeueth particularly that christes righteousnesse is his righteousnesse and hath reconciled him to god and shall iustifie him in god presence then doth faith worke his true and proper worke for this cannot be done but by faith and where faith is this must needes be done the second point is that faith alone and no other vertue nor spirituall power in mans soule is able to doe this and this may be proued by comparing it with all the principall vertues of the soule for amongst all there are none that may come into comparison with faith but hope and loue both which especially loue haue their seuerall and special excellencies yet haue neither of them nor both of them this vertue to apprehend and apply christes righteousnesse the property of loue is to extend it selfe and with it selfe to carie manie passions or affections of the heart and to place them vpon the thing that is loued yet cannot loue be said properly to apprehend christ for he must needes be apprehended before he can be loued and the proper action of hope is to waite and expect for a blessing to come so hope waites for saluation but properly apprehends it not for saluation must first be beleeued and then hoped or expected so saith ieremie lament it is good both to trust and to waite for the saluation of the lord to trust that is to beleeue assuredly it will come there is the action of faith and to waite till it doe come that is the action of hope thus we see the seuerall natures and actions of these two worthy vertues but the proper action of faith is to apprehend and lay hold on christ and his righteousnesse and to apply them to a mans owne soule and that being done then come loue and hope amp do their duties and so though loue last longer then faith doth yet faith is afore loue and makes the way for it to conclude this second point faith is a hand to take hold on christ amp his benefits loue is a hand to giue out tokens of faith both to god and man for corinthian loue seeketh not her owne but others good namely the good of them that are loued hope is an eye looking out and wayting for the good things promised so that as faith is the hand of the soule so loue is the hand and hope is the eye of faith loue the hand wherby it worketh and hope the eye whereby it waiteth and looketh for the performance of such things as faith hath apprehended and beleeued if the church of rome thinke this any wrong to this holy vertue of loue to be the hand of faith let them know it is not ours it is the doctrine of the apostle where he saith faith worketh by loue if faith worke by it then surely loue is the hand of faith thus faith worketh by loue waiteth by hope but beleeueth by it selfe and for this cause the righteousnesse that makes vs righteous before god is rather called the righteousnesse of faith then of any other christian vertue or grace of the spirit and for the same cause is it that so often in s pauls epistles it is called by the same name as philipp the third and last point concerning noahs faith is that noah was made heire of this righteousnesse a speciall commendation of his faith it made him heire of true and sauing righteousnesse that is it gaue him a true title vnto it amp made him heire apparant of that glory which it assureth euery one that apprehends it by this true faith and so he was made as certainly and as truly partaker of it as the young prince is assured of his crowne and kingdom at his time or the heire of his fathers lands here two most worthy doctrines doe offer themselues to our view the excellencie of faith appeares thus it makes a holy man assured amp certaine of his saluation by christ iesus the church of rome saith it is presumption in any man to thinke so vnlesse he haue an extraordinary reuelation but we learne from the scripture that if a man haue true faith that is able to assure him of saluation for faith makes him an heire of true righteousnesse and of saluation thereby now we know the heire is most sure and certaine of his inheritance what euer hee gets or loseth he is sure of that but this righteousnesse and saluation by it is his inheritance therefore he may be and is by faith assured of it the papists therefore doe wrong vnto this doctrine and deroga e from the dignitie of true faith but this is their custome they will extoll any thing rather then that which the holy scripture so much extolleth namely true faith for if they knew what it is trulie to know christ and to beleeue in him by that faith which worketh by loue they would then know that faith makes a man heire of happinesse and therefore most assured of it secondly here we may see the excellencie of a christian mans estate he is not naked nor destitute of comforts but is heire of a glorious inheritance by meanes of his faith and a christian mans inheritance is christs righteousnesse out of which we learne first that no man by any good workes done by or in himselfe can merit true and iustifying righteousnesse the pharisaical papists teach so but their conceit is here ouerthrowen by the doctrine of the holy ghost for sauing righteousnesse is his inheritance which we know is alwaies gotten by the father and descends from the father to the son as a free token of his loue and it were scornfull and absurd to see a son offer to buy his inheritance of his father it being against the nature of an inheritance to come any other wayes but by free gift from the father to the son therefore our righteousnesse that must saue vs being as wee see here our inheritance let vs resolue of it we cannot buie nor merit it againe heere is sure and solide comfort against all the grie s and crosses and losses of this world god children must needes haue their portion of afflictions in this life but here is their comfort they may lose their goods liuings possessions their good names their healths their liues but their inheritance standeth sure and firme and cannot be lost let them therfore here learne not to grieue out of measure for a holy man may say thus to himselfe and that most truly my father may frowne on me for my faults and chastice me for my sinnes but i am sure he will not disenherite me for i am heire by faith of christs righteousnesse and i may lose many things but i shall not lose that thirdly and lastly here must god children learne their duties they are heires to a godly and glorious inheritance and christes righteousnesse is their inheritance therefore they must learne to set and settle all their affections on this inheritance for there is nothing in the world more worthy to be affected then a faire inheritance we must therefore first labour aboue all worldly things for this inheritance namely to be made partakers of this righteousnesse this is that pearle which wee hauing found must sell all we haue to buy it and when wee haue gotten it wee must care to keepe it and therefore must lay it vp in our verie hearts and soules and keeping it wee must reioyce and delight in it aboue the world and all the pleasures of it this is the glorious portion which our god and father leaueth vs as his children what should all the care of our hearts be but to preserue it naboth had a little vineyard that came to him from his father by inheritance ahab the king would giue him money or a better vineyard for it but naboth would not nay saith he god forbid i should sell my fathers inheritance kings ampc if he made such account of an earthly inheritance what should we of the heauenly if hee of a poore vineyard what should wee of the glory of heauen if hee denied the king to sell it for a better should not wee denie the diuell to leaue our part in christ and his righteousnesse for the world or anie thing that hee can promise vs in all such temptations our answere should be god forbid i should sell away my inheritance which my god and father gaue mee thus did blessed paul who esteemed the world and all in it doung and drosse that hee might winne christ and be made partaker of this righteousnesse so must wee if wee will be worthie of this inheritance prize and value it aboue this world and thinke basely of all the pompe and pleasures of this world in comparison of it and rather be content to lose the world then to leaue it and lastly when wee haue it and are thus carefull to preserue it where should our content ioy and delight be but in this our inheritance so doth the heire nothing so reioyceth him as to thinke of his inheritance here therefore the madnesse of carnall man is discouered who reioyce exceedingly in the honours profit and pleasures of this li e as swine in their bellies and neuer goe further but alas this is not their inheritance if they looke to haue their soules saued therefore herein they shew themselues voide of grace and of all hope of a better world for if they had they would reioyce in it and not in the vaine and transitory delights of this world which perish in the vsing and are lost with more torment and vexa on then they were kept with delight we must learne hen to vse this world as though we vsed it not corinthian and f he lord vouchsafe vs any portion of pleasures in this world we must take it thankfully as aboue our inheritance amp must therfore vse it lawfully amp soberly but haue our hearts amp the ioy of them vpo our inheritance which is in heauen whereof we are made heires by faith and wherin we are fellow heires with this blessed noah who was made heire of that righteousnes which is of faith and thus haue wee heard the most glorious commendation of noahs faith and of noah by his faith and of all the examples before the floud now follow the second sort of examples namely such as liued in the second world after the floud they are all of two sorts either such as liued afore the giuing of the law or after afore the giuing of the law here are many wherof as of all the other kinds some are man some woman the first of those blessed man after the floud whose faith is here renowned is abraham that great father of whom and whose faith because he was a father of so many faithful more is spoken then of any one by faith abraham when he was called obayed god to go out into a place which he should afterward receiue for inheritance and he went out not knowing whether he should goe concerning holy abraham heere are more examples then one recorded and his faith is renowned many wayes more verses are spent of him then of some fiue others and the reason is because his faith was more excellent then any others that followed him in which regard hee is called the father of the faithfull oftentimes in the new testament especially in the epistles to the romanes and galathians the first example of his faith and the fourth in order of the whole is of his leauing his owne natiue country and how at god commaundement he went he knew not whether onely he knew god called him and therfore he would goe wherein appeared a most worthy faith now concerning this his faith and obedience the text layeth downe two points the cause or ground thereof which was god calling he was called of god the fruite or effect of his faith he harkened and obayed and this his obedience is amplified by diverse particulars the matter of it he went out of his country the end to take possession of a country which he should not enioy of a long time the manner he went out not knowing whither he should goe the first point is the cause or ground of abrahams faith in this action and is laid downe in the first words by faith abraham when he was called this story is taken out of gen the chap the cause of abrahams faith is god calling god calling is an action of god whereby he appointeth a man to som certaine codition or state of life in this world or after this life and in this regard god is compared to a generall in the field which assigneth euery souldier his standing and duty so doth god appoint euery man his place and duty in the church concerning these callings let vs see the meanes how hee calleth and the seuerall states whereto he calleth man for the meanes or manner god calleth man wayes immediatly or by meanes somtime immediatly by himself and his own voice as the extraordinary prophets in the olde testament amp the apostles in the new so saith s paul of himselfe he was called to be an apostle not of man nor by man but by iesus christ and god the father galath sometime mediatly by man directed by himselfe amp furnished or inabled for that duty and so were called the ordinarie prophets and priests of the old and the euangelists pastors amp doctors of the new testament the first was extraordinary this is ordinary the first is for an vnbeleeuing or a misbeleeuing people the second is for an ordinary amp established church now of these waies god called abraham immediatly by himselfe from heauen gen secondly for y e estates of life wherunto god calleth man they are three generall particular personall god generall calling is whereby hee calleth all man to repentance by the gospell and so to life eternall of this speaks the apostle rom whom god predestinated them also he called and rom the calling of god is without repentance heereby hee calls man in this life to the state of grace and to the state of glory in heauen and this is to all his particular calling is when hee calleth and assigneth man to some particular estate and duty in family church or common wealth as when a man is called to be a magistrate minister master of a familie lawyer physician ampc thirdly god calleth some man to some priuate personall duty which he designeth not to others but to be done by them alone such a calling had hee assigned him matthew that would needes be perfect goe sell all that thou hast ampc now the calling of abraham in this place is to be referred to this third kinde for it was a priuate and personall calling to leaue his country his kindred his lands his possessions and to goe seeke another and to be the father of the faithfull and to receiue the couenant and this dutie belongs to none but who shal personally amp by name be called vnto it yet all these three callings may concu re in one as here in him for he was called to be a christian for the generall and a gouernour of a great family for the particular calling but that that is in this place vnderstoode is this extraordinarie and personall calling to leaue his country and in it we are to consider three circumstances who was called when how he was called for the first abraham was called the son of terah but neither his father terah nor his brother nahor were called but abraham alone but it may worthily be demaunded why god should not call his father and his kindred there can be no aunswere but this that the apostle giueth rom god hath mercy on whom he will and withholdeth it from whom he will he calleth isaac and refuseth ismael loueth iacob and hateth esau taketh abell and leaueth cain euen because he will and for no cause that wee know but why then calls hee abraham and not his kindred is not that partiality i answere he is tied to none hee might refuse all therefore the meruaile is that he calls any but why some and not other why abraham and not his kindred no reason can be giuen for god iudgements are wonderful but as that that is impossible with man is possible with god math so that that is iniustice or partiality with man is iustice with god and it is extream folly and intolerable presumption for vs to weigh god actions in the balance of our shallow reason for the second but when was abraham called for the time there are two circumstances worth the obseruation first abraham was called to this dignity when he liued in idolatry with his fathers so saith ioshua thus saith the lord your fathers dwelt beyond the floud in old time euen terah the father of abraham and serued other god if abraham was called by god when he was an idolater then it is apparant hee had not purchased god fauour by his workes where we learne that the whole worke of a mans saluation is to be ascribed to god meere mercy who as the prophet saith was found of them that sought him not esay abraham neuer dreamed of the true god nor of any new couenant of grace and saluation when god called him and so when paul was going armed with bloudy furie and his furie armed with commissions and authoritie against the saints then god from heauen called him and of a persecuter made him the principall instrument of his glory acts ampc therefore to apply this to our selues if god haue vouchsafed vs the same grace and taken vs to be his people and made a couenant of saluation with vs which in former times haue beene sinners of the gentiles wee must learne here to see whence this fauour is and therefore to ascribe nothing to our selues but giue all the glory vnto god and particularly for euery one of vs if god haue been so mercifull to any of vs as when we were popish or superstitious with our parents or kindred to open our eyes and bring vs home to his holy truth or when wee weltred in wickednesse and sensuality with the profane world to touch our hearts and to call vs to grace and sanctification let vs often remember and freely acknowledge this his vndeserued mercie and say with the holy prophet vnto th e belongeth mercy but vnto vs open shame secondly for the time when abraham was called it was when hee was yeeres of age or there abouts as is manifest in the storie genesis therefore wee see that god for a long time let him lie in his blindnesse and idolatry ere he called him it is more then likely that abraham in that meane time liued ciuilly amp followed learning amp other ciuill courses and in that time it is likely he attayned to that measure of knowledge in astronomie and other learning for which he is renowned in olde writers but this was the first time that he was called to know and serue the true god in his true seruice heere wee learne that though a man perseuere in his sinnes for a long time and passe his best yeeres in vanitie without repentance and thereby be in a grieuous and fearefull estate yet true beleeuers and man penitent must not therefore iudge them cast awayes for god mercy calls a man in his old age and toucheth the heart when it pleaseth him christ in the parable calls some at the houre mat and so god calleth man to grace in their old age we must therfore spare these sharp amp vnsauourie censures which som vnaduisedly cast vpon such man for charity thinketh not evil corinthian where it may thinke or suppose any possibibility of good but contrariwise pray for them and hope of their conuersions because we know that at what time soeuer a sinner repents of his sinne god will forgiue him ezek and yet for all this man must not presume to liue carelesly in their sinnes for that is desperately to tempt god but must follow the holy counsell of salomon ecclesiastes to remember their creator in the dayes of their youth and to turne vnto god when they haue meanes least god take away the meanes and with the meanes his fauour from them abraham was not called till he was olde but when hee was called hee harkened and obayed so must thou when god calls thee by afflictions or by his word then answere and obay as abraham did or else abrahams calling in his old age will be little comfort to thee thus much for the time thirdly for the manner of his calling it is laied downe in the storie of genesis to be in an earnest kinde of counsell goe out saith god from thy kindred and from thy fathers house vnto the land that i will shew thee where it is to be obserued he saith not barely goe or come forth but hee amplifieth and vrgeth it with many wordes and circumstances if any aske why god did so when hee might haue giuen the commaundement in one word i answer the reason is that abraham might haue cause more seriously to consider of god calling and to imprint it more deepely in his heart least at the first brunt he should haue obayed and afterward haue shrunk back for it is doubtlesse that this calling was harsh to reason and that abraham found many hindrances and therefore it were dangerous he would haue started back after som trial of these difficulty he must passe throgh if he had had but a bare call amp commaundement to go but when god saith to him goe out of thy natiue country let it not stay thee that thou wast borne there nor hinder thee that thy kinred dwels there but leaue all and come with me forsake all and trust me follow me into the land that i will show thee i take thee from one but i will giue thee another when god i say vseth all these and it may bee many more like words to abraham its apparant hee would haue him furnished with strength and resolution to goe through with his calling after he had once made entrance into it out of which practice of god we learne this instruction that god would haue no man enter vpon any calling or dutie with a fearefull and faint heart nor with a doubtfull minde but with a strong amp settled resolution to go through stitch with it and not to relent and repent in the midst and for this end god would haue all man afore they enter seriously to consider the place or duty they are to vndertake for the lord had rather a man should refuse at first then hauing entred to looke backe againe and it is great folly for man hastily and suddainly or humorously to cast themselues vpon any calling and then vpon triall and experience of the dangers and difficulty thereof to be weary and wish they had neuer done it man in this world are generally wiser in matters of the world if a man bee to build a house hee will not forth with set vpon building such a house as his humor desireth but wil first of all sit down amp count the cost amp then his owne ability to see if the one will counteruaile the other else hee neuer begins it so saith christ the wisedome of god of the wisedome of this world and the like also he saith for war that no prince will fight with his enemie on vnequall tearmes but will knowe himselfe able to sustaine the encounter luke so the calling of a christian is to professe the gospell of christ as the magistrates is to defend it the ministers to teach it so all mes to professe it now it is as impossible to build without cost or to fight without power of man as to profess christ in any calling either generall or particular without crosses we must therefore consider first what our calling and profession will cost vs it is sure to cost vs a dangering of our credites and estimation in the world it may be our goods our liberties it may be our liues themselues againe what enemy we haue to encounter in this spirituall warfare the diuell death hell sinne corruption and the crafty malice of wicked man all these we are sure to meete withall were it not then folly for a man to vndertake this profession and not to consider thus much aforehand the want of this is cause why some put their hands to the plough and after shrinke away and make themselues ridiculous to their enemy corporall and spirituall and for particular callings the case euen standeth so also some man thinke the calling of a magistrate a place of honour and therefore ambitiously plot and desire to raise themselues into authority neuer remembring the burden and trouble they are sure to finde which when they feele to be too heauie for their lazie shoulders to beare with ease they foully fall to plaine carelesnesse and neglect all doing good in their places and wish they had neuer bought honour so deare so others thinke the ministerie nothing but a place of ease exemption and preferment and in these conceites rush presumptuously amp rashly into that holy state neuer thinking aforehand of that great charge of soules they are to take nor of that heauie account they are to make for them nor of the hatred and contempt and extreame disgraces they are sure to finde if they doe their duties with conscience and therefore when vpon experience they finde it so to be they either fall to carnall courses with the world and neglect their duties that by these two meanes they may please the world or else they continue in their duties with much griefe and vexation wishing they had chosen rather any calling then the ministerie and by either of both do expose themselues to shame and much rebuke whereas contrariwise hee that aforehand casts his account what it will cost him to be a minister what he must vndertake what he must lose what hee is sure to finde is so settled and resolued afore hand as hee goeth through all dangers and contempts with comfort courage and contentment let vs therefore all learne by this practice of god when we thinke to enter vpon any such duty to reason with our selues as god did with abraham what we are to forsake and what we are to meete withall so shall we not afterward repent vs but goe on with much assurance as abraham did this point i haue the more inlarged because it is of speciall vse in christian life thus much of the cause of abrahams faith god calling and all the circumstances therein the second point is the excellencie and commendation thereof commended by the fruite and effect it made him yeeld to this calling of god and this obedience of his faith is spoken of two wayes it is laide downe generally hee obayed god it is further commended by diverse particulars which we shall see in their places here is the obedience of abrahams faith laide downe in one generall word he obayed that is when god called him to leaue his country kindred and friends hee yeelded against reason because god bade him when god told him he would carie him into another land he beleeued it and lest a certaine for an vncertaine a possession for an expectation heere was the power and excellencie of his faith appearing in this obedience from hence we learne two instructions first seeing abraham is the father of the faithfull rom and our glory is to be children of faithfull abraham therefore wee must all learne as good children to followe our father in framing our liues according to god calling when god calleth vs to anie state of life then to obay and when not god but the world or ou owne corrupt h m ours call vs then not to obay for to obay the first is the obedience of faith but to obay the second is the obedience of corruption therefore against this practice of holy abraham two sorts of man doe offend and thereby shewe themselues children vnlike their father abraham first such man as being called by god to some functions or duties will not obay for examples wee haue too many to som god saith leaue thy priuate care which is for none but thy selfe be a magistrate and vndertake the publike care of the common wealth but they as though they were born for themselues will not imploy themselues in publike seruice to some god saith leaue thy ease and thy care of worldlie credit and vndertake the teaching of my people and care not for the contempt of that calling so thou maist saue soules but their carnall carnall credit and ease is more deere vnto them then abrahams kindred is to him they will not forsake them these and all that doe so may make what shew they will but they are not children of abraham seeing they want his faith and they want in his faith because they faile in his obedience they must therfore learne to yeeld when god calleth and not to stand vpon such base allegations of wordly matters when abraham left country and kindred to obay god secondly such man as respect not god calling but look what the swinge of their natures or the course of the wicked world carie them vnto they presently yeeld and obay not regarding whether it be god calling or no three sorts of man are most faulty in this kinde first such as are content to grow in wealth either by oppression as vsurie or extortion or by craft and dissembling or by any other such indirect course whereby their brother is hurt looking onely at gaine but not regarding whence it comes secondly such as liue by dicing carding or by playes and enterludes thinking any trade lawful that brings in wealth or that gets money neuer caring whether god allow the calling or no thirdly such as liue in no calling but spend their time in eating drink sleeping and sporting because they haue liuings of their owne and lands left by their parents all these and all such like doe obay indeede but whereunto not vnto god calling for alas he neuer called them to these courses but hath often recalled them from it therefore this is the obedience not of faith but of corruption and of the world which is a plaine disobedience vnto god for as the wisedom of the flesh or the world is foolishnesse with god rom so obedience to the flesh or the world is disobedience and rebellion against god all such man must know that they are not the children of abraham because they are not children of his faith nor can they be heires of his faith because they practice not his obedience for god calling and no other rule for our liues must christian man admit when he calleth they must obay and when he calls not or allowes not a course of gayning or a trade of life though all the world allowed it we must not follow it this will honour them and their profession before god abrahams faith iustified him before god but his obedience iustified his faith obedience saith samuel sam is better then sacrifice but disobedience is as the sinne of witchcraft therefore let all christians approue their faith by their obedience hanging on god mouth and attending on god calling for directions of their whole life and resolue with dauid psalm thy word is a lanterne to my feete and a light to my pathes when kings may not liue but by this light of god calling and god word it is shamefull presumption for ordinary man to frame their liues by lights of their owne making in the second place out of ahrahams obedience let vs marke by what meanes obayed he by faith learne here the true nature of true faith it brings forth true obedience where euer it is and therefore christian obedience is called the obedience of faith rom and these two cannot be seperated no more then light from the sun or heate from fire for as the sun naturally and necessarily giues light and the fire heate no lesse doth true faith yeeld true obedience to god commaundements which being so it teacheth vs for the vse first how our church and doctrine are slaundered by the papists who please themselues in saying wee looke to be saued by sole faith and without workes for we teach that though a man be iustified without respect to his workes yet no man was euer iustified whose faith did not bring forth good and holy workes and wee teach that none is heire of abrahams faith which is not also of his obedience therefore god will reward their lying tongue secondly this teacheth vs that abrahams faith is rare in these dayes many make profession of abrahams religion but it seemes they are as farre deceiued as the iewes were john the iewes would be abrahams children because they were of his flesh and man now will be so because they are of his profession but both are farre wide for wee must be children of faithfull abraham but if we will be like him in faith we must be like him in obedience also when god calls vs to any duty we must forsake our owne natures and denie our owne affections and crosse our owne corruptions to follow god calling and to doe our duties so shall wee be true children of abraham when we are like our father in his best vertues thus wee see his obedience laied downe generally particularly in his obedience there are laid downe three points the matter of his obedience all which are layde downe directly in the text the end of his obedience all which are layde downe directly in the text the manner of his obedience all which are layde downe directly in the text for the matter of his obedience it followeth in these words to goe out into a place ampc the particular matter wherein abrahams obedience cosisted was this at god commaundement he went out of his owne country into another for one which hee should inherite he left that which he did inherite heere many points of good instruction may be learned first see here the power and strength of true faith it was a wonderfull hard thing for abraham to do thus for first hee was well striken in yeeres yeeres olde young man delight to be stirring but man growen into yeeres doe loue to settle themselues as birdes in their nests and it is grieuous vnto them to think of remouing or taking long iournies secondly he must leaue his owne country where hee was bred borne and brought vp which all man generally doe loue by nature thirdly hee must leaue his goods and lands and liuings which no doubt were great for hauing liued so long in his natiue country and being born as he was his estate doubtlesse was very great fourthly he must leaue his acquaintance with which hee had liued all his life yes his owne kindred and must goe liue amongst strangers these foure considerations were so manie hindrances to his obedience and strong temptations to make him haue looked backward but such is the power of his faith hee is commaunded of god therefore hee obayeth and goeth out the vse is to teach vs what a faith we haue for if wee measure all god commaundements by our naturall affections our faith is but a shadow and hypocrisie but if wee consult not with flesh and bloud but rest and rely on god word and giue absolute obedience to his comaundements then our faith is such as abrahams was in the next place some may meruaile why the lord should commaund him so hard a matter and lay so stra te a commaundement vpon him as to leaue his country and liuing which seemed vnreasonable amp his kindred which was vnnaturall i answer the reason is not that god delighteth in vnreasonable or vnnatural courses or in laying heauie burdens vpon his children but he did it for good and holy ends as first to proue abraham and to see what was in him as a friend is no tried in ordinarie but in great matters so it is knowne who is god friend in matters of difficultie hereby therefore god made the faith and obedience of his servant to shine more gloriously againe to breake the corruption of his heart for our wicked natures loue peace and ease and welfare and hearts desire but god will crosse those courses and send vs troubles many wayes that so hee may pull downe the height of our corruptions and humble vs to his owne hand the vse is to teach vs to make true vse of our afflictions and of those many hard crosses that must fall vpon vs in our course of seruing god namely to know that they are sent from god not as a hard hearted or cruell iudge but as a wise and mercifull father who wisheth our good and who will so bles e vnto vs the hardest and heauiest crosses that befall vs in our liues if we receiue them in patience amp faith that we shall say with dauid psalm it is good for vs that we haue been in trouble for thereby we haue learned to know god and our selues better thirdly whereas abraham at god commaundement goeth out of his country into another we learne that it is not unlawful for a christian man to goe out of his owne country and trauaile into another and there to abide for some or for a long time prouided his causes be good and iust as namely these which follow first if he haue a particular commaundement of god as here abraham had secondly if hee haue a lawful calling of the church or state whereof he is a member as if he be sent to a generall councel or be sent as ambassadour either to stay for a time or to stay there as lieger thirdly if it be for the safety of his life in a good cause so moses exod fled into the land of midian and there stayed when pharaoh sought his life and christ himselfe fled with his father and mother into egypt from the furie of herod math the like may be said for them that to preserue their liberty flie from the cruelty of their creditors who will not take honest and reasonable satisfaction of a surety for another man or of a childe for the fathers debts but in no case for them who trauaile in purpose to defeate their creditors or thereby to deliuer themselues from payment of their due debts being able to pay of both these wee haue example in dauid amp his followers dauid himselfe was faine to flie for his life from saul vniust cruelty and therefore went and dwelt amongst the philistims sam and sam there cam to dauid such as were in trouble and in debt and these were with him in all his trauaile and persecutions now doubtlesse had they beene vngodly man who had not cared how they came into debt no how they paid it dauid would neuer haue beene their prince as that text saith he was fourthly if it be for the maintenance of pure religion and keeping a good conscience this hath christs warranty mat when they persecute you in one citie flie vnto another for this cause many of our fore fathers in the former age were faine to flie into germany swwitzerland amp to geneua and for these causes diverse of other nation doe repaire to this nation and are here entertained fiftly if it be for the getting or encreasing of any good learning and lawful knowledge especially diuine knowledge for matter of religion thus the queene of saba went ou of the inmost parts of africa to ierusalem in asia to see and heare salomon kings and for that cause shee is highly commended by christ himselfe math thus may yong man trauell for learning or the tongues especially such as intend thereby to fit themselues for publike seruice so it be with safetie of religion and securitie of conscience sixtly if it be for the practice of a mans lawful calling as for traffic and thus merchant may and do lawfully trauaile into all nation and haue their factors there resident prouided they lose not their soules to gaine for their body their trauailing is allowed by christ in the parable where he saith the kingdome of heauen is like a merchant man that seekes good pearles math seauenthly if it be to receiue and take possession of any goods or lands lawfully descended or fallen vnto a man in another nation as sometime it doth this seemes to be allowed by christ in the parable where he saith a certain noble man went into a far country to receiue for himselfe a kingdome and so to come againe luke in a word if it be vpon any good and sufficient cause allowable in good reason and not contrary any part of god word but as for such as leaue their country and trauell into other either vpon leuitie to see strange sights and fashions or being malefactors flie from their due punishment or being in debt go away to deceiue their creditors or being vaine glorious to make themselues knowen or being at enmitie to fight combats or to kill their enemie all these and all such like can haue no comfort in their trauailes for they send themselues god sent them not they are out of god protection because they goe without his warrant and as many of them as goe away to escape the hand of the magistrate let them be assured they shall not escape the hand of god in the fourth place here is a comfort for all such as are banished from their owne natiue country for god and his gospels sake for here abraham the prince of patriarkes was a banished man and liued in a strange country the greater part of all his life let such man therefore take patiently what god laieth vpo them for it is not their misery or mishap alone but hath beene common to god children in all ages againe christ himselfe pronounceth them blessed who suffer persecution for righteousnesse sake for though they be exiles from their owne kingdome or tossed vp amp downe the kingdomes of the earth yet theirs is the kingdom of heauen math lastly though this commaundement was personally directed to abraham and concernes not vs as it did him yet it hath his force and vse euen to vs for though we are not to goe out of our country and leaue our liuings and habitations yet we must doe that that is proportionable hereunto that which is commanded to salomons wife is to all christians harken o daughter and consider incline thine eare forget thy owne kindred and thy fathers house so shall the king take pleasure in thy beauty psalm this wife of salomon is the soule of euery christian the spouse of christ the true salomon who by nature is daughter to heathen pharaoh that is to sinne corruption and wrath but being maried to christ must forget her owne kindred and fathers house that is their owne nature and naturall affections and carnall desires and then shall christ our king and spirituall husband take pleasure in vs and reioice to doe vs good and this is the chiefe trauailing of all and most acceptable to god when a man goeth out of himselfe and denieth his owne desires to obay god and to serue christ iesus thus we see the matter of his obedience now followeth the end which he should after receiue for inheritance the second particular in his obedience is the end why he went out of his owne country namely to inherite another that is the land of canaan called else where the land of promise because god promised it vnto him and to his eed now abraham at god commaundement went out of his owne country into this place to inherite it and to take possession of it but it may be obiected he inherited it not yes furthermore stephen saith act god brought him in but gaue him no inheritance in it no not the bredth of a foote i answere though abraham did not inherite it personally himselfe yet he may be said to inherite it two wayes sacramentally or mystically in his posteritie first sacramentally thus the land of canaan is to be vnderstoode not onely as a country of asia fruitfull and fertile and plentifull of all good things wherein the onely visible church was confirmed till christs comming but further as a type of the heauenly canaan where the triumphant church raignes in glory with god and thus abraham did in his owne person inherite it for he was translated from this world after his death into the glory of heauen and in that respect the glory of heauen is rather called the bosome of abraham luke then of any other the patriarkes both for the excellencie of his faith as also for that the promise of inheriting the land of canaan was first of all personally made to him which because he enioyed not he was recompenced with the fruition of the true cannaan from hence we learne a notable doctrine that god in performing of his promises giueth not oftentimes the verie particular thing promised but something equiualent or proportionable to it or else better thus in the fift commaundement obedient children are promised by god long life as a reward for honouring their parents now when hee takes them away in their best age as hee did iosias kings hee giueth them eternall life which is not onely proportionable but farre exceeding the thing promised so heere hee promiseth abraham the land of canaan but when it comes to the performance hee giues him a better euen the true canaan the kingdome of heauen the vse heereof is to teach vs wisedome for the true discerning of god mercifull performance of his promises for he performeth them not alwayes one way vnto his children sometime he giueth the very particular thing promised as vnto the children of israel their deliuerance out of egypt vnto hezekiah the restoring of his health and such like sometime he giueth not it but something which shall be as good or better vnto his children as when they are in some great danger and craue deliuerance or in some necessitie and haue promise of supply god oftentimes deliuereth them not but giueth them patience and feeling of his fauour in such sort as is many degrees more comfortable vnto them and herein god heareth their prayers and performeth his promise to them to their full contentation secondly abraham inherited canaan in his posterity for though god promised it to himselfe when he was yeeres olde gen and to him and to his seede gen yet neither he nor his immediate seede enioyed it but his posteritie the israelites yeares after the promise as s paul proueth galath and so abraham inherited it in his posteritie which is a part of him and they inherited it many hundreth yeares euen vntill the comming of christ as afore we learned that god in the performance of his promises giueth not alwayes the thing promised so heere let vs learne that he doth not alwayes performe them to the same parties and yet most truly performeth them if therefore god doth not to our selues nor in our times accomplish his promises or prophecies we must not be impatient but waite in patience for as the holy prophet saith the vision is yet for an appointed time but at the last it shall speake and not lie though it tarie waite for it it shall surely come and shall not stay habba to this end dauid also most diuinely saith psalm light is sowen for the righteous and ioy for the vpright in heart see light and ioy belongs vnto them but how it is sowen that is it is in hope and expectation and not alwayes in fruition therefore as the husbandman casts his seede into the earth and is content to stay almost a full yeere without it or any profit of it and yet is patient all that while because he is sure it will come amp bring encrease with it so must wee waite patiently on the lord and know that whatsoeuer he hath promised we or ours after vs shall be sure to enioy it and though we doe not what great matter is it if our children doe for we know that oftentimes the father soweth and dieth ere the haruest and so the son reapeth so for god great and gracious promises which are sowen vnto the fathers if themselues do not their children are sure to reape the comfortable haruest of performance and thus we see how abraham inherited the land of canaan which is called the land of promise because it was so long and so often promised to so many great patriarkes in the second place it is to be obserued when god promised this vnto abraham euen then when the land of canaan was possessed by many mighty kings so that it may be here further doubted how abraham could take any comfort in this promise seeing it was at that day held by almost kings greater and lesse as we may see in ioshua chap and further the people were many and strong the cities were strong walled and full of huge giants numb yet for all this he not onely beleeues and obayeth but as god promised so he went to it and tooke possession and died in this faith that god would performe his promise and that his posteritie should inherite it all as afterward indeede they did euen from moses to christ if it be asked how this could be the answere is that abraham knew that god was king of kings and had the world and kingdomes of the world in his hand and disposition and therfore assured himselfe that hee could bring to passe what hee had promised and make good his word notwithstanding all such impediments to the contrarie and as hee beleeued it came to passe his posterity came to it entred as conquerers vpon this gift of god and by the power of god so amazed all these kings and their people as some submitted as the gibeonits and they that did not were all slaine and their country conquered as we may reade at large in the booke of ioshua all the stories whereof are briefly comprehended by dauid in fewe words where he saith we haue heard with our eares our fathers haue tolde vs how thou o lord droue out the heathen with thy hand and planted them in how thou destroyed the people and made them grow psalm out of which we learne two instructions first that the change of states and alteration of kingdomes or common wealths are in god hand and that he can turne them one way or other as it pleaseth him to this purpose saith dauid in the fore named psalme verse the fourth they inherited not the land by their owne sword neither did their owne arme saue them but thy right hand and thy arme and the light of thy countenance because thou didst fauour them this must teach vs to pray earnestly in our daily prayers for the good estate of this kingdome wherein we liue and of that worthy prince and queene vnder whose gouernment wee haue beene so long and so liberally blessed for the welfare and prosperity the certainty and security of it and her is not in our policie might munition ship not in the strength of our nauie nor in the power of our armour nor in the chiualrie of our people nor in the wisedome of our councell though for all these we are a people honoured of our friends and feared of our enemy but in the mighty hand of our god who as daniel saith beareth rule ouer the kingdomes of the earth and giueth them to whomsoeuer he will daniel seeing therefore the king of heauen in the giuer and establisher the remouer and changer of kingdomes of the earth let vs assure our selues that the prayers of elisha are the horse and chariots of israell kinges and surely if elisha for his prayer was acknowledged by the king himself to be his father then doubtlesse the godly ministers and such other in our church as pray daily for the peace of our ierusalem are worthy to be accounted good children of our church and worthy members of our state secondly here we learne what is the ruine of kingdomes and ouerthrow of estates namely sinne and vngodlinesse this is most apparant in the present example for why did god take this land from the cananites and giue it to abraham and his seede the stories of the olde testament answere nothing but sinne in deuteronomie moses chargeth the israelites that they doe not after the abhominations of the heathen cananites for saith he because of their abhominable sinnes god did cast them out before you deut and why did not god instantly giue it to abraham to inherite after the promise euen because the wickednesse of these amorites was not then full gen that is their sinnes were not then ripe for we must know that though god be the absolute and soueraigne lord of all kingdomes and may dispose them as hee will yet he rather exerciseth his iustice then his power and neuer ouerturneth any state but vpon cause of their apparant sinfulnesse nor can the amorites or cananites pleade herein any hard measure for the same god dealt afterward in the same iustice with his owne people giuing the kingdome of iudah to the chaldeans and israel to the assyrians and the cause is laid downe most memorably in the storie when the israelites sinned against the lord their god and walked after the fashions of the heathen whom the lord had cast out before them and did secretly things that were wicked and made images and serued idols and though god warned them by his prophets yet would they not obay but hardned their neckes and so finally left all the commandements of god then the lord was exceeding wrothe with israel and cast them also out of his sight kings from the seauenth verse to the thus sinne is able to ouerturne kingdomes be they cananites israelites or whosoeuer let this teach vs all to looke to our liues amp make conscience of all sin especially great amp capitall amp crying sins for the sinnes of a people are wormes and cankers eating out the life and strength of a comon wealth and let our state and gouernment learne here to look to the reformation of our people especially for great sinnes for open profanenesse or vncleanenesse or oppressions or iniustice or extortions or cruelties and exactions all these or any of these sinnes raigning in a state are able to ouerturne the best established kingdome on the earth and will at last doe power and policie what they can make the land spewe out her inhabitant and in the meane time let the wily wits of man iudge as they list it will proue true that the sinfull and profane man is the worst and the godly and conscionable man the best friend to a state and best subiect in a kingdome thus much for the second point in abrahams obedience namely the end of it the third and last point is the manner of his obedience which followeth in these words and he went out not knowing whither he went the manner of this his leauing his country in mans reason would seeme strange nay the world will condemne it for plaine foolishnesse for a man to leaue a certainty for an vncertainty but it may here be doubted how the apostle can here say that he knew not whither he went seeing these words are not in the storie of the olde testament doth not that practice allow traditions beside scripture i answer first we refuse no traditions which are agreeable to the scripture and analogie of faith but such as are agreeable to one of these wee receiue them though not as scripture secondly if the apostles in the new testament doe adde any thing in any story which is not in the olde as s paul doth the manner of the sorcerers of egypt iannes and iam res timoth that circumstance by them so added is to be holden as scripture and no tradition because they hauing the same spirit of god which the writers of the olde testament had haue inserted it into the body of scripture euen as the three sentences of the heathen poets alledged by saint paul acts corinthians titus haue now a diuine truth in them which they had not before but yet will some say the apostles had these things from the olde testament by tradition seeing they were not written i answer we may safely graunt it and yet our cause loseth nothing though it may be they had them by inspiration and not by tradition that being as likely or much more then the other thirdly but for this particular i answere that the apostle had the words or at least the matter out of the storie in genesis for thus goe the words g d said to abraham goe out of thy country ampc into the land that i will shew thee hee named none to him but told him he would shew him one so then abraham went out at god appointment and god knew but he knew not whither he went he knew well the land he left but he knew not the land he should haue but it may be againe obiected that this is not true for it appeares gen that abraham with sarah his wife and all their substance departed to goe into the land of canaan and to the land of canaan they came therefore he knew whither he went namely to that land i answer it is true he went out with purpose and assurance to inherite a land promised him by god but not named to him and whereas it is there said he went out to goe into the land of canaan that is spoken in respect of the performance when he was come thither not of the first promise made him at his departure or of the time when moses wrote it not of the time when god spake it to abraham and that he knew not what land god did mean vntill he cam thither is plain in the seauenth verse where it is said that when abraham had passed through all the country and wai come into canaan then god appeared to him and said this land will i giue vnto thy seede but till then god neuer named it vnto him and therfore we read afore that he beleeued and obayed vpon the generall promise but now when god did particularly specifie and shew what land hee then shewed his thankfulnesse to god and did there build an altar vnto the god that had appeared vnto him thus it is cleare that abraham went out not knowing whither he went which being so it appeares that abraham did that which the world would call plaine foolishnesse to leaue knowen friends for vnknowen certaine liuing for vncertaine is a simple course in mans reason at least the world will say he might first haue demaunded of god what land that was which he should haue before he left that which he had but abraham makes no such questions moues no such doubts but belieueth and obayeth and goeth out of his certaine dwelling at god calling though he knew not where to lodge at night this practice of faithfull abraham hath profitable vse first here we learne that though god commaundements seeme foolish and vnreasonable yet wee must obay them christ saith if a man will euer come in the kingdome of heauen he must be borne againe john s paul saith if any man among you seeme to be wise let him be a foole that he may be wise corinthian christ saith if any man will be my disciple he must denie himselfe and follow me luke but how can these comaundements be beleeued or done how can reason beleeue them how can nature doe them so disputed the woman of samaria with christ john when christ tolde her he would giue her of the water of life she replied sir thou hast nothing to drawe with and the well is deepe whence then hast thou that water of life thus we obiect and reason against god with carnall obiections and waigh god commaundements in the balance of reason thus god and his commaundements are much abused by vs and this is the cause wee heare and reade god word and profit not by it because we ponder it in our reason and allowe nor follow it no further then it agreeth with our naturall affections as a man that will needs stand vnder a pent house hath no water falling on him though it should raine neuer so precious water from heauen so when the water of life out of the word of god should drop vpon our soules to comfort our consciences and to wash away our sinnes we haue our deuices out of wit and distinctions out of reason as pent houses to keepe it from vs that it slides away and neuer hath any worke in vs but contrariwise we must remember abraham the father of our faith and when we heare god word we must with him captiuate our reason and subdue our affections to it measure them by god word and not it by them and what we cannot yeeld to in the obedience of reason we must obay with the obedience of faith and so shall god word haue a gracious and powerfull worke in vs secondly here we must learne that though we see no profit come by obaying god commaundements yet wee must obay them for what profit could abraham see in leauing a certaine liuing for an vncertaintie yet he obayed and went vpon the bare word of god building vpon it that god being his guide he could not goe astray so must wee followe god sincerely and doe his commaundements though no profit seeme can come thereby but some will say shall godly man be led like blindefolde fooles shall they refuse all meanes of helpe by wit and policie this is the way to make them ridiculous and asses for the wicked world to ride vpon i answere let godly man vse all their wit and looke with all their eyes in their actions with man of this world but in the obedience of god commaundements let them doe as abraham did follow god calling though it seeme to be to no end in obedience to god we must doe as blindemen doe who followe their guides though it be through woods amp rocks hills or dales or dangerous places regarding nothing fearing nothing only following amp trusting their guides who haue eyes for them though they haue none for themselues so must we follow god calling and yeeld absolute obedience to his commaundements fearing nothing but trusting to the faithfulnesse of his power and assuredly beleeuing that he being our blessed guide we shall not be mis led thus to doe is true faith but alas how contrary is the practice of the world man deale with god as we doe with loose chapmen whom wee will not trust without a good pawne so we will not obay god commaundements longer then his religion serues our turne nor will we trust and follow god without the pawnes of profit and pleasure nay wee doe worse most man esteeme of god no better nor vse him any better then they doe theeues in their houses if a man come into our house that is giuen to stealing we trust him as long as hee is in our sight but if he be out of our sight we thinke euer he is stealing so if man see the meanes of god prouidence they will take his word and trust it but else god must excuse them they may not trust him further then they see him and if the commaundements of god sound to their content and tend to their profit they will obay them but if not they will cast them behinde their backe at least they will make a pause at the matter and take their owne time and if god wayes seeme pleasant and profitable they will walke in them or else they will leaue them and walke in their owne and hence is it that man in distresses runne to wizards and wise man others deale fraudulently and deceitfully others worke on the sabaoth day and thus by indirect and unlawful dealing they labour to inrich themselues and to bring their purposes to passe and why all this but because god commaundements doe not sound to their purpose nor tend to their profit and therefore they will not obay them if these man had beene in abrahams case they would neuer haue gone out not knowing whither to goe but they would haue argued the matter with god and haue thought it good wisedome to pause well afore they leaue a certaintie for an vncertaintie but contrariwise abraham thought it foolishnesse to reason with god and therefore performed absolute obedience and for this cause hee and his faith are renowned to this day namely yeares after him and shall be till the worlds end this was the obedience of faith and this to doe is to be true subiects to god kingdome if the king call a man from his owne liuing to come to himselfe and to the court who will not leaue what he hath of his owne and trust his word so who will not leaue his owne wisedome and relie on the promise and word of god and obay his commaundements though there seeme at the first no profit can come thereby thus shall wee be sure both to haue sufficient for this world and shall also be true children of faithfull abraham hitherto of the first example of abrahams faith by faith he abode in the land of promise as in a strange country as one that dwelt in tents with isaac and iacob heires with him of the same promise here is the second example of abrahams faith and the fift in order and is concerning abrahams abiding or dwelling in that land whereinto god had called him and this he also did by faith as he went out of his owne countrey and came into canaan by the power and leading of his faith so by the same faith hee abode and dwelt in the same land the parts are two the action of abrahams faith in the ninth verse the reason of that his so doing in the tenth the action in the ninth verse is spoken of two wayes the first point in order is his dwelling in the land of canaan called here the land of promise canaan is now called the land of promise because it was promised in the verse afore going as we then heard so that the meaning is he abode in that land which was promised him when he came out of his owne country which country abraham knew not by name when he left his own nor till he came thither but then god told him this is the land i will giue thee and thy seede genesis in this land thus promised abraham dwelt and remained the rest of his life which was a hundreth yeeres in this action of abraham are three particular points for the first concerning abrahams dwelling in canaan diverse questions may be moued first how it is true that he abode or dwelt there seeing it is apparant in the story he dwelt in egypt gen and in gerar gen i answer the meaning is not that he stayed there euery day of his life but that he liued and died there and made it the place of his residence and ordinary habitation whereunto he alwaies resorted againe if any occasion drewe him abroade and further hee went not into egypt but vpon such special cause as could not be otherwise helped as vpon a famine or such like genesis then there came a famine in the land therefore abraham went downe into egypt to soiourne there where it appeares first that the cause was extraordinarie secondly that hee went not to make any dwelling but to soiourne there for a time and then to repaire home againe where wee learne that as a man is not to depart out of that land where god hath appointed him to dwell but vpon good and sufficient causes so when those causes cease which drewe him out hee is not to stay longer from home but to repaire againe to the place of his ordinarie dwelling god would haue a man dwell at home and it is leuitie and a token of an vnconstant minde and a running heade for a man to desire to bee alwayes abroade birdes flie abroade but so as they may come to their neasts at night so man should endeuour as much as may be to take fewe occasions of being from their dwellings and when they needes must to let it be for as short a time as may be for as it is a signe of a light woman prouerbs her feete cannot abide in her house so is it of an vnstayde man vpon euerie occasion to bee caried from home we must therefore followe holy abraham who is heere commended for abiding or dwelling in the country which god had giuen him againe this practice of abrahams faith condemnes the wandring begger to be an vnfaithfull and vngracious generation our land by the abuse of our peace and plenty is full of such aske them where they dwell their answere is they haue small dwelling but looke into the matter and they haue the largest dwelling of all for they dwell euery where amp all abroad they count it bondage to be tied to one towne or dwell in one parish and thinke it freedome and libertie to dwell euery where these are carerpillers of a common wealth and the greatest robbers of the poore that are common theeues steale from rich man but these steale from the poore they get that from man which the true poore should haue no good comes to church nor common wealth by these man but much hurt to both for a finger cut off from his place is of no vse so a man liuing out of his calling and out of his place is of no vse in the body politic happy will it be with our church amp state when we haue such lawes and such execution of them as that this disorder may be reformed amp euery man confined to his owne dwelling amp none suffred to liue in our kingdome who is not of som parish for let vs be assured so many wandring beggers so many blemishes in our gouernment thirdly abrahams dwelling in this land being a fruite of his faith teacheth vs it is no good token but an ill signe for a man to be vncertaine in his dwelling it is the fashion of many man if they trauaile they neuer lodge at one place twise and for their dwelling it is not certain but now in the north now in the south now in this parish now in that now in this iurisdiction now in another sometime in the citie sometime in the countrey who be these but either such as be in debt and purpose to deale ill with their creditors or that are malefactors and heereby labour to auoide the censure of authoritie or else they be papists which by this meanes labour to lurke vnseene and to escape the law as many of them doe either by skipping out of one parish diocesse countie or prouince into another and so auoiding the authoritie of all or else by lurking in great cities and so lying as soiourners and not as parishioners vnseene or vnmarked in so great multitudes let our authoritie take the more carefull notice of such man the more craftily they labour to creepe from vnder it and let such man knowe they discouer themselues the more by this practice to bee vnfaithfull either to god or man or both seeing that god heere commendes abraham for dwelling or staying in that place which god had appointed him and so much for this question againe it may heere be demaunded how abraham might lawfully dwell in canaan seeing it was then idolatrous it may seeme that therefore it is not unlawful for man to dwell in popish or idolatrous country i answere abraham did not so vpon any priuate motion nor for any worldly cause but vpon speciall warrant and calling from god otherwise his so doing had not beene iustifiable therefore that practice of his cannot be a warrant for any to doe the like without the like cause and calling but how could abraham be preserued from the contagion of idolaters liuing amongst them i answere first god that called him thither did there preserue him againe abraham liued in the country but conuersed not with the people at all but in some necessary and ciuill affaires and by this meanes hee escaped the danger of infection where we may learne that if any man would liue in such places without hurt to their conscience let them first be sure that they haue a calling and warrant from god to liue in those country secondly let them conuerse with idolaters warily and sparingly and so shall they preserue themselues from the occasions of euill as abraham did who abode in an idolatrous country and so though not without danger yet without hurt to his religion thus wee see abraham dwelt in the land of canaan now secondly this land is called the land of promise that is the land formerly promised him by god when hee called him out of his owne countrey and it is likely that the apostle doth not heere first of all call it so but that it was knowen generally amongst the patriarkes by that name and that abraham himselfe did first of all so call it who when hee looked vpon it and considered the fruitfulnesse and excellency of it did euermore remember and call to minde this land is promised to me this is mine by promise and herein he rested and satisfied himselfe though he had not the possession of it heere wee may see the excellencie of true faith which depends vpon the promises of god though they be vnperformed a land of promise contents abraham hee leaues the possession to his posteritie it is hard to finde such faith in the world it is land in possession which wee looke for a land of promise cannot content vs but let vs labour to practice faith and to take comfort in the promises of god and leaue the performance to god appointed time thirdly he dwelt in this land by faith and no meruaile for had it not beene by faith hee would neuer haue dwelt there where he had not so much as a roome for his tent to stand in but hee must borrow it nor to burie his dead in but hee must buy it this was against reason yet by faith hee dwelt there as afore by faith he left his owne which was also against reason where still the power of faith is magnified to bee such as it will carie a man ouer all impediments of obedience and will giue him victorie not against one but against all obiections and power to performe not one but many things contrary to carnal wisedom wee must heere learne to examine whether wee haue a true and sound faith or no if wee haue then wee must not doe some one or fewe actions in faith or die in faith but wee must liue by faith the whole course of our liues wee must walke by faith and not by sight saith the apostle corinthians so saith hee of himselfe galathians i liue by the faith in the son of god he saith not hee hopes to die in that faith but he liues by it and in the former place e saith not wee must set a step or two but wee must walke by faith which argueth a continued action and therefore it is that saint peter saith god children are kept by the power of god through faith vnto saluation peter in which words two thinges are spoken of faith the first is affirmed namely that faith preserueth a man to saluation through all hindrances either of inward temptations or outward crosses which the diuell or the world can lay in his way this preseruation is one of the greatest workes in the world and therefore it is worthily ascribed to god the power of god preserueth vs but through faith the second is implyed that therefore we must labour to keepe that faith euermore with vs which must keepe vs and to cherish and preserue that that must preserue vs to saluation dauid was an excellent practicioner hereof no man was more tried and tossed then he yet he euer drew neere vnto god psalm indeede sometime he said all man were liers but that was in his feare psalm and againe i am cast out of thy sight but that was in his haste psalm that is when the force of some passion or the violence of some temptations did carie him headlong but otherwise he euer liued the life of faith so must wee not thinke to liue in sensuality and die in faith but to liue by faith in all our actions from one day to another meditating daily on god promises and beleeuing them and relying on them and applying the generalls to our owne selues and practicing faith by making conscience of sinne and inuring our selues to patience and long suffering thus doing we shall be children of faithfull abraham who first by faith left his owne country and then by faith also dwelt still in the land of canaan and thus much for the action of his faith hee abode in the land of promise now followe the circumstances of the action which are two the manner how the persons with who the manner is laid downe in two points as a stranger as one that dwelt in tents the first point for the manner is laide downe in these words as in a strange country the meaning is he esteemed it a strange country to him and accounted himself a stranger in it against which it may be obiected that he was familiarly acquainted with mamre aner and eshcol three great amp mighty man of that country then he amp they were confederates together gen therfore it seemes he liued not like a stranger in the country some answere that these three were not cananites but neere a kinne to abraham and had other names but the text is plaine in that place that mamre was an amorite and the other two were his brother therefore the answere is that in all likelyhood they three were proselites and that by abrahams godly perswasions they had renounced idolatry and were come to the knowledge of the true god and that they ioyned with abraham in the worship of the true god and so were his conuerts whereupon abraham as he might lawfully conuersed with them as his familiar friends and hereof there are two inducements first it is said gen that they were confederates with abraham and it appeared so by their deedes for they ioyned their powers and assisted him in the war against the the kings gen secondly it is said gen that abraham dwelt on the land of mamre he was his tenant or farmour now it is more then likely abraham would not haue so farre beene beholden to them but that they were true christians and of his owne religion therefore this hinders not but hee might be a stranger notwithstanding vnto the body of the people and that it is true that abraham saith of himself vnto some of them gen i am a stranger and soiourner amongst you but it may be then demanded why did abraham liue amongst them as a stranger and in that land as a soiourner i answer the reasons were diverse first he had title giuen to that land but no possession he therefore contented himselfe with that that god gaue him and chalenged not any possession all the dayes of his life but bought or borrowed of mamre the place where he liued and dwelt gen and of the hittites a place of buriall gen ampc this may teach all man not to be too hasty in seeking for that that it may be is their right let not man prescribe their owne times nor be their owne caruers but leaue their affaires to god disposing and enter no further then they see god goeth afore them abraham must be a stranger in his owne land and thou sometime must be content for a time to be a stranger to that which is thine owne secondly they were all of them for the most part heathen idolaters amongst whom abraham would not conuerse but as sparingly as might be now if abraham would be a stranger in his own country rather then liue familiarly with idolaters it sheweth how little faith and lesse conscience they haue who can be content to liue in the midst amongst idolaters where they haue nothing to doe and can conuerse with them in all familiarity without any scruple of conscience abraham made himselfe a stranger at home to auoide idolatry but they will make themselues at home in a strange country to intangle themselues in idolatry these man will hardly proue the children of abraham these reasons abraham himselfe had in this his so doing there is a third a more spirituall or mysticall reason and that reason god had in making abraham liue in canaan as a stranger namely to teach all christian man their duty to the worlds end abraham is the father of the faithfull rom and this is our honour to be the children of abraham we must therfore follow our father in his faith and in the practice of it we must liue in this world as pilgrimes and strangers euen in the midst of all our peace amp prosperity of all our liberty riches lands and possessions yes of all our friends amp worldly acquaintance if it seeme strange how this can be i answere the practice of it consists in six actions first we must not bathe our selues in the pleasures of this world pilgrimes take but little delight in their iourneyes because they thinke themselues not at home this is s peters argument dearely beloued as strangers and pilgrimes abstaine from fleshly lusts which fight against the soule pet for too much delight in fleshly pleasures smothers the grace of god in vs and lets loose all sinnes and giues life vnto all corruptions secondly we must vse this world as though we vsed it not that is euen the necessary comforts amp delights thereof they be the very words of the apostle corinthian for so the pilgrime when he passeth through a strange country hath not his minde troubled with looking or thinking on the goods or comodities of that country where he is but vsing as much thereof as is necessary for him all his thoughts are on his owne country so should we when we are in our best estates in our greatest iollity in the midst of our wealth and abundance of pleasures cast our mindes from them amp haue our thoughts euen then conuersing in heauen where is the place of our abode this is likewise the apostles exhortation philipp worldly man make their belly their god that is drowne themselues in carnall pleasures so farre as they forget any other god any other heauen but we must not doe so our conuersation must be in heauen from whence wee looke for our sauiour iesus christ thirdly wee must haue a serious care and endeuour to please god for all the earth is his and wee are but soiourners in his sight therfore as the pilgrime is carefull to please the lord of the country by whose leaue he trauels through it so must we be to please the lord seeing as god saith leuit the land is his and we are but strangers and soiourners with him and hereunto adde a fourth which is neere a kinne vnto it we must cast all our care on god seeing that he is lord of the earth amp we are but pilgrimes and soiourners dauid saith psalm the earth is the lord and all that therein is the same dauid cofesseth psalm he is a stranger before god amp a soiourner as all his fathers were amp therupon desireth god to heare his prayer hearken to his cry amp not to keep silence at his teares as though he had said inasmuch as i soiourne with thee thou article to heare my complaint for as a soiourner cares nor lookes for nothing but depends on them for all things with whom he soiournes so must we cast all our care on god for he careth for vs he is our landlord wee are his farmours and tenants wee hold the earth from him by no lease for yeares but at his will and it is lent vs let vs therefore but haue care to please this our landlord and care for nothing fiftly wee must giue continuall thankes and praise to god for his good blessings wee receiue in this world for all are his and wee are but strangers thus did all god saints in olde time iacob hee was lesse then the least of god mercies but especially there is one memorable example of dauid and the church in his dayes chronicles when hee had prepared abundantly for the building of the temple hee prostrated himselfe before god and in his owne name and the peoples saide thus riches and honour come of thee therefore our god wee thanke thee and praise thy glorious name but who am i and what is my people that wee should offer vnto thee for all is thine and of thine owne haue wee giuen thee for wee are strangers before thee and soiourners as all our fathers were thankfulnesse beseemes all man especially strangers therefore as pilgrimes doe thankfully accept the fauours shewed them in a strange country so must we all the blessings god giues vs in this world where we are but strangers sixtly and lastly we must hasten to the kingdome as a pilgrime doth to his iourneyes end or to his owne country and till he can is alwaies thinking of it and sighing after it so must we who are not dwellers but soiourners in these hou es of clay long after heauen and as s paul saith he did co et to remoue from hence and to dwell with the lord strangers re not to take such pleasure in foraine country as to forget their owne so christians must not be so in loue with this world as to forget or neglect the world to come if they do hey are vnworthy of it and shew themselues not strangers s abraham here was but man of this world who haue their ortion in this life psalm in performing these six actions man shew themselues rangers in this world and thus must we doe euen in the idst of all worldly prosperitie if wee looke uer to enioy the glory of a better and thus doing we shall be children of faithfull abraham who dwelt in the land of canaan as in a strange country the second point for the manner how abraham dwelt in canaan is that he built himselfe no houses nor made orchards or gardens but dwelt in tents or tabernacles which were such houses as now are vsed in war and are yet called by the same name tents or pauilions whose matter is not wood nor stone but cloth stuffe or skinnes and are easily reared and soone taken downe and when a man departeth he may cary his house with him that abraham did thus appeares in the stories written of him he came to bethell and there pitched his tent gen and gen he remoued his tent and god appeared vnto him as he sate in his tent dore and being asked where sarah was answered shee is within in the tent and these tents are called his place gen and his house out of all which places it is plaine that he dwelt in tents and that not onely at his first comming when he had not time to build him an house but euen all the dayes of his life after his comming into the land of canaan but why did abraham dwell in tents and not in houses was it because then there were no houses not so for there were cities built euen afore the floud gen cain built a citie no meruaile therefore if there were many after as sodome and all her sisters and though it appeares not they digged into the earth for naturall stone yet had they bricke which they made themselues genesis and surely the world which built the huge tower of babell gen would not stick to build themselues houses nor can it be said that those cities sodome gomorrah and the rest were nothing but a multitude of tents together for we read genes that lot dwelling in sodome receiued angels into his house and in the verse that the sodomites came and enuironed his house round about to take them thinking they had been man and when lot refused to deliuer them that they pressed sore vpon the house to haue broken vp the doore but all this might haue bin spared if it had bin nothing but a tent which a childe may cut in peeces with a knife it is manifest then that there were houses in those daies why then did abraham build none was it because he was poore amp could not nor so for contrariwise gen hee carried with him from his owne countrey all the substance he possessed and what that was is particularized gen he was very rich in cattell in siluer and in gold his riches were both great amp of the best so the he could but would not but why would he not was it vpon a prowd humour or in a conceited singularitie because he would not bee like other man but haue a singular way of his owne no abraham was none of those who allow nothing but that that is done of themselues and who thinke nothing good if it be ordinarie for he was a holy man and famous for his faith so then none of these were the reasons of this his so doing the reasons then why abraham and other holy patriarchs vsed to dwell in tents and not to build them houses were of two sorts ciuill and holy the ciuill or politicke respect that they had was this they holding themselues god servant did depende on his word and therefore did submit themselues to goe vp and down the world whither soeuer god did call the being then to remooue euery day they knew not when nor whither it was therefore both the fittest and cheapest to dwell in tents which were soone pitched vp and soone taken downe neither neede it to seeme strange that they could liue for cold in those poore thin tents all the yeare long for the country and climate there was alwaies temperate enough for cold and rather inclining to too much heate the holy or religious respect was this they held theselues but strangers vpon earth amp therfore would not build themselues cities or houses as looking or caring to liue vpon earth but dwelled in tents as seeming desirous to remoue from the earth to heauen the sooner the better and this did the fathers of the old testament not that they thoght it unlawful to build cities or dwell in houses but that they might testifie their religion and their expectation of another world in the midst of that profane age wherein they liued wherein there were almost none that either regarded remembred or acknowledged a world to come and this was not the particular or singular deed of abraham alone all holy man in those daies liued in tents gen it is cleere that noah dwelt in tents though then he was king of all the world and so did lot also as long as he liued with abraham gen lot h d sheepe and cattell and tents and thus they did because as the apostle saith they had here no enduring city but they sought for one to come heb and they thought they euer heard that voice sounding in their eares micah arise amp depart for this is not your rest contrariwise the wicked of the world because they set vp their rest in this world and cared for no other they began presently to build them houses nay cities as cain did euen in the beginning ge and the sodomites had a citie euen walled as is likely for lot was sitting in the gate of sodome when the two angels came to him gen and the canaanites had cities walled exceeding high numb but we find not that euer god children built them cities vntill they came to haue a settled church of their owne but contrariwise it is worth obseruing that god promiseth his people that they shall come and dwell in cities which they built not namely which were built by worldly man to their hand and thus wee see the reasons why abraham dwelt in tents now let vs see the vse of it first here we learne frugalitie out of the ciuill vse of their tents that is to vse the blessings and comforts of this life as soberly and sparingly as may be and to bestowe as little cost as may be of our selues in such things as perish in the vsing namely meate drinke apparell and houses for what is spent herein is spent only on our selues and being spent is gone therefore the lesse the better alwaies prouided there be a discreet care had of our healths and of the credit of the places wee hold and of our inabling to the duties of our calling which beeing sufficiently prouided for it is a christian frugality to spare what further may bespared and he hath the lesse to answer for who spendeth the least in superfluities again here we are taught contentation in the state which god hath appointed vs amp not to striue too fast to climbe to wealth these holy man can be content to dwell in tents and tabernacles thogh they might haue compassed much more for they were great and mightie man abraham had man able to beare a sword in his house daiely amp with them and a little helpe more hee ouerthrewe diverse kings and rescued lot gen he that durst encounter and did ouercome such an hoste how many inhabitant of the countrey could he haue beat out of their houses and how many tenants could hee haue put out of their liuings and how much of that countrey could he haue inclosed to himselfe surely euen as much and as many as hee had pleased yet dooth hee no such thing but contrariwise considering himselfe to bee but a tenant vnder god hee is content to let euery man sit quietly by him and himselfe to dwell in tents rather than to incroach one foote further than god bade him though he had bin able this checketh the pride or couetousnesse or ambition or all of such as ioyne house to house land to land lordship to lordship towne to towne and care not how many mens houses they pull downe to build one of their own nor how many man want land and liuing so they haue their parkes and pastures gardens and orchards and all other delights they can deuise these are so farre from abrahams minde who desired onely so much land as his tent might stand on amp might feed his cattell as they can inclose and make seuerall to themselues that which in common should be the liuing of many soules but what can befall such man but that that esay prophecieth to them esay woe be vnto them that ioyne house to house and land to land till there bee no place for the poore to dwell in thirdly in that abraham liued thus as ready euer to depart into any other countrey when god would call him it sheweth that true faith dooth neuer limit god hand either in the greatnesse or length of trialls but submitteth it selfe wholly to his will being resolued amp contet to suffer all trials how great soeuer and how many soeuer god pleaseth to lay vpon a man reason would haue said i haue left one countrey at god word if i must leaue another then i shall neuer knowe an ende nor haue any thing certaine to trust to but faith saith as i haue left one countrey at god calling so vpon his worde i will leaue twentie more for god hath as good reason to bid me the second time as the first and his loue cannot faile me he may stil trie me but can neuer leaue me thus spake abrahams faith and not he alone for iob though hee crie out of the violence of his temptation the arrowes of the almighty are in mee and the venime thereof doth drinke vp my spirits amp the terror of god doe fight against me chap yet when faith comes to play his part he then protesteth that though god kill him yet he will trust in him amp he shall be his saluation chap see abrahams faith will lead him from countrey to countrey and iobs will carrie him through life and death and noble dauid is not behinde for his part for hee will lose his kingdome if god will haue it so sam if saith dauid god say i haue no delight in thee loe here i am let him doe to me not what i in my reason could wish but what seemeth good in his eies behold now in these holy man the practice and obedience of true faith it prescribes not god the measure ther and thus doing wee haue our conuersation in heauen though we liue on the earth and this wee should doe the rather because generally the world is full of such man who as the same place saith doe minde nothing but earthly things now it is a hard thing for a man to be vnlike the world and to resist multitudes and generall examples but we must still remember wee are abrahams children and children must labour to bee like their father and not the common multitude and it must more mooue a good child what his father alone doth than what is done by many other thirdly let vs obserue how god promising abraham only the land of canaan that is a temporall inheritance hee lookes further for a city in heauen this he did out of his faith for hee knowing that canaan was but a type of heauen therefore in consideration of the earthly canaan hee arose to a consideration of the heauenly and in the promise of the earthly apprehended the heauenly this is the true and christian vse of all god blessings giuen in this life in them to behold better things laid vp in heauen and shadowed in the other man vse for their vse spectacles in reading but they take no pleasure in looking vpon them but at other things by and through them so should christians through all temporall blessings looke at spirituall and eternall which are promised and shadowed vnder the temporall thus doth christ himselfe teach vs in the very order of the lord praier directing vs to pray for temporall blessings first in the fourth petition and then for eternall in the fift and sixt as though that the one were introductions and passage to the other and this made the prophets so ordinarily couer spirituall blessings vnder temporall and put temporall deliuerances for spirituall and confusedly oftentimes one for another because that the holy man of the olde church did neuer rest in view of any temporall promise or blessing but ascended to the contemplation of higher things in them how pittiful then is the practice of worldly man who vse god blessings so as they daily abuse and peruert them vsing meate to gluttony raiment to pride learning to vaine glory speech to flatterie wit to deceipt authoritie to reuenge callings to oppression whereas they are all giuen to be helps in god seruice and furtherances in religion and meanes to helpe vs towards heauen these man looke at god gifts with the eie of reason and no further but if they looked at them with the eie of faith as abraham did it would teach them to make a heauenly and spirituall vse of them as he did lastly in the generall state of the reason and of abrahams practice obserue how he hauing promise of canaa waited for heauen now no man waiteth for any thing but that which he hath hope of nor hopeth truly and properly for any thing but that which he hath assurance of for hope maketh not ashamed rom no worldly hope for that hath deceiued no more than euer trusted it but hope in god neuer deceiued man nor went any away disappointed that hoped in god therfore here it is apparant that hope of heauen goeth with assurance and this assurance must be particular to the beleeuer as the beleefe and faith is but the papists say this is true indeed of abraham hee had not only hope but euen full assurance but that came by extraordinary reuelation so that this is a rare example amp his particular reuelation is no generall warrant to vs we answer from s paul rom that abraham is the father of the faithfull and that his faith is a patterne for all christians to follow for else why doth the apostle so farre extoll amp set forth that faith of his aboue years after his death shall it be only for his commendation and not for our imitation also therefore euery man that will walke in the steps of holy abraham may come with him to that measure of faith that he may waite for heauen with assurance to enioy it now let vs come to the particular description of that heauen which abraham thus waited for the description hath three parts it is said to be a citie that hath a foundation that god made and built it for the first abraham by his faith waited for heauen but for which for there are three heauens or differences of heauen in the scripture the first that wherein we liue and breath birds flie and clouds mooue the second that wherein the starres are the third is that that is aboue them both and is invisible the seat of god glory where god reuealeth his maiestie in speciall manner to man and angels this heauen abraham waited for for as for the first he liued in it and for the second he knew it as well as most man for it is credibly thought he was a notable astronomer so that it was the third and highest heauen hee waited for which hee knewe this world could not giue him and therefore expected it in another now this heauen which was abrahams hope is called a citie a citie properly is a place for the habitation of man compassed with walles and distinguished by streetes and houses now properly heauen or the estate of holy man in heauen is not a city but as elsewhere in the scripture it is called a house a tabernacle a temple an inheritance a kingdome so is it here called a city namely for the resemblance it hath therunto which consisteth specially in foure points a citie hath many houses greater lesse and for all sorts so in heauen also there are many mansions ioh places of glory for all man none neede to feare that hee shall not haue fulnesse of ioy and perfect happinesse a citie is built and at first was ordained to this end that many citizens might liue together in concord and amitie so the kingdome of heauen is a heauenly city where the saints of god shall liue in perfect peace and lo e with fulnesse of ioy euery one in himselfe and each one in another the goodnesse or excellency of a city consists in this to haue good lawes good magistrates to execute them and good people performing subiection and obedience therefore the kingdome of heauen is the most perfect citie wherein god lawes are the onely lawes and they shall be written in mens hearts where each one is a sufficient gouernour of himselfe amp yet all subiect to god and their god vnto them all in all a city is a place where generally are all necessaries and comforts for mans life one part of the countrey hath this commoditie another that but in the citie are all either brought into it or of it selfe so in heauen are all parts of perfection and all complements of happinesse to make the state of god children there infinitely blessed such a glorious place is the citie that was abrahams hope now for the vse hereof first is heauen such a city here is a notable comfort to the poore and plaine countrey man who liues in the simplicity of the countrey life tilling the ground or keeping cattell and it may be neuer sawe or at the least neuer tasted of the pleasures and delights of cities if he serue god and keepe a good conscience here is his happinesse hee shall be citizen in the high and heauenly ierusalem that city which was the hope of the holy man of god in all ages secondly this may teach citizens in the great populous and pompous cities of this world to labour also to be citizens in heauen for that is a citie also and the best on earth are but shadowes of it and it may shame them that are drowned in the pleasures and delicacies of earthly cities and care not nor looke after the city of the liuing god the heauenly ierusalem as it is called heb but alas it seemes they care not for this shame for where is securitie wantonnesse profanenesse oppressions so comon as in these great cities and as in the apostles times the countrey towne berea was more zealous and religious than the rich and stately citie of thessalonica acts so is it generally to this day especially at such places in the countrey where teaching and knowledge is but let such cities know that as they haue better meanes amp more comforts and their very name should put them in minde and make them in loue with heauen so they shall receiue greater damnation lastly cities are places of freedome and all such great places haue some notable priuiledges therefore man desire to be free in such places as is to bee seene in london rome venice ampc euen the greatest persons will bee content to be free of them and many seeke it and pay deer for it or at least worke a long time for it but heauen is the city of cities the perfection of beauty and true happinesse therefore let euery one that desires either honour or happinesse labour and striue to be a free man of heauen and neuer rest till he know hee be and let those that liue in cities when they are admitted free man as daily some are remember what a bles ednes it will be if they can bee admitted free man of the glorious citie which is aboue and how little that shall auaile them if they want this which was the hope and ioy of abraham and all holy man to goe further this citie which abrahams faith waited for is described by two points that it hath a foundation that the maker and builder was god for the first heauenly ierusalem hath a foundation such a one as no city in this world hath amp by this phrase the holy ghost insinuates vnto vs what be the properties of heauen which be two the state of heauen is vnchangeable euerlasting and eternall first the state of the elect in heauen amp their glory there is not subiect to corruption or the least alteration as appeareth in that notable and loftie description of the heauenly ierusalem apocrypha and from the verse to the it hath a great wall and high gates angels for porters and the wall had foundations of sorts of most excellent pretious stones and the wall it selfe was iasper and the citie pure gold like crystall the state of it is shadowed by pretious stones and gold to signifie as well the durablenesse as the excellency therof and in the psalme verse it is called the mountaine of god holines hills are hardly remoued and therefore dauid saith that mount zion cannot bee remooued but remaineth for euer psalm now if that be true of mount zion in this world which must needes bee taken either literally for the state of the visible church which cannot be vtterly ouerthrowen or mystically for the state of god grace which in this world cannot totally amp finally be lost i say if this mount zion standeth fast and cannot be remoued how much more true i it of the state of glory in heauen and of the triumphant church and of heauenly zion that it is so vnchangeable so durable so vnremoueable that it cannot be shaken but standeth fast for euer and in this respect well may the apostle say here it hath a foundation which the holy ghost in the reuelation saith to haue foundations secondly the state of the elect in heauen is not onely sure but euerlasting that is without end psalm the inheritance of holy man is perpetuall and therfore s peter saith that the inheritance reserued in heauen for vs is immortall amp not fading away it fades not away there is the vnchangeablenesse it is immortall there is the eternity of it and this is meant by hauing a foundation for in this world so much the longer doth any thing endure as the foundation is stronger therefore seeing the heauenly city hath such a foundation no maruell though it indure for euer now put these two together and they shew the perfect excellency of that city which is both vnchangeable and eternall where we learne the great difference between the state of that world and this present world wherin we liue in the body for what is there in this world so excellent so p etious so costly so artificiall but is subiect both to alteration and in the ende to dissolution the longest day hath his night and the longest life endeth in death after many miseries and tossings the longest empires and mightiest monarchy had their period after many mutations the stateliest and strongest cities ended in ruine after many ciuill broiles massacres and other miseries so that no glory no strength no happinesse nothing at all is there in this world that is either constant or perpetuall but subiect to vtter dissolution in the end and in the meane time to pittifull alterations so weake a foundation hath this world and the best things in it but contrariwise the glory of heauen hath such a foundation as it is both vncha geable and eternall the consideration of this difference hath manifold amp profitable vse first we may see how reasonable the counsell of the apostle is tim charge them that are rich in this world that they be not high minded and put not their trust in vncertaine riches but in the liuing god for what a misery and vanity is it to trust in that that is vncertaine and therefore will deceiue them the apostle tells them what to doe namely doe good and be rich in good works and be ready to distribute laying vp in store for themselues a good foundatio against the time to come that they may obtain eternal life that is that they so sped their riches in holines amp charity that they may the ende attaine heauen which is the citie that hath a foundation and who would not spend riches which are so vncertaine for heauen which is so certaine a glory secondly this must teach vs to followe the counsell of christ iesus math lay not vp for your selues treasures on earth where moth and canker corrupt amp theeues steale but in heauen where is neither canker moth theefe nor any other corruption euery man naturally must haue his treasure and that is it whereon hee sets his heart now that is vnworthy of a mans heart which will bee lost wee knowe not how soone but let vs make heauen our treasure the glory whereof is both eternall and vnchangeable againe seeing nothing here is certaine wee must learne to seeke sound comfort where it may be had seeke it in this world and it will faile vs but seeke it in the sincere worship of god and that will minister such comfort in this life and such glory in heauen as hath a foundation and will neuer faile vs further this must put vs in minde of the holy kings aduise which is to remember our creator in the daies of our youth ecclesiastes seeing this world is so vncertaine and our life hath so weake a foundation as wee are not sure to liue to come to olde age euery man therefore is to heare the conclusion of all which is to feare god and keepe his commandements and this the sooner the better for else for a little foolish and vaine pleasure transitorie amp which hath no foundation we shall venter the loosing of that glorious citie which hath a sure foundation it followeth in the description whose maker and builder is god the second point in the description of this citie is that god was the maker builder or author of it these two words are both one and therefore it is a needlesse labour of some that would distinguish between them for the meaning is god made that is prepared the glory of heauen and he built it as though he should say heauenly ierusalem is a glorious citie and no maruell though it be so for god made it and if you will needs that beeing a city it must be built be it so for god is the builder of it this doctrine is euident in the scriptures psalm god by his wisdome made the heauens and here is another maine difference between this world and the glory of heauen the cities of this world were built by man but heauen by god himselfe the arte and skill of man built the cities of the earth and sometime the couetousnesse or other corruption of man as is manifest in the beginning for cain a couetous cruell and ambitious man built the first citie in the world but holy and good man haue not the honour to bee builders of this city no they are citizens of it but god onely is the author and builder of it no man may doubt hereof because this third heauen is inuisible for the angels also are inuisible and yet god creatures besides our creed teacheth that god is creator of all things visible and inuisible if wee doubt why god made it seeing hee made all things for man and man in this world hath no sight nor vse of it the answer is god made it for two ends first to be his owne glorious palace not wherein he would confine his beeing or his presence but wherein he would make his glorie most apparant and wherein his glory should in a sort dwell in which regards it is called his throne esay and in our lord praier wee say by christs owne teaching that god our father is in heauen therefore as princes builde themselues palaces to shewe their power and puissance and to magnifie themselues and to bee fit habitations for their greatnesse so god made the third heauen to be the throne of his glory secondly hee had also a respect herein to his creatures for hee made that heauen therein to reueale his maiestie and glory to his reasonable creatures angels and m and by shewing them his glory to glorifie them for in god presence is the fulnesse of ioy psalm vltim and in this sense is it true that god made all things for man as man for himselfe namely all things either for his soule or body or both either for his vse in this life or in the other and so the third heauen was made for mans vse not in this life but in the life to come for his soule vntill the last iudgement and after that for both soule amp body hence we learne diverse instructions first in that the third heauen which neuer was seene with the eie of man is here positiuely affirmed to be made by god wee learne that therefore it is one of god creatures and not eternall as some hold and goe about to prooue thus god is eternall but hee must bee in some place and heauen is the seate and place of god therefore it is coeternall with god but i answere from god word that though heauen bee the seate and throne of god glory and where hee manifesteth and magnifieth his glory yet is it not the place of his substance and beeing for that is infinite and incomprehensible and it is against the christian faith to imagine the godhead to bee comprehended or contained in any place kings the heauens yes the heauens of heauens cannot comprehend thee o lord how much more vnable is this house that i haue built nor is it materiall that we knowe not on what day it was created or that it is not named amongst the workes of the creation for the same is true of the angels also and it pleased god wisedome for speciall causes to name no creatures particularly in the creation but visible whereas wee knowe both from our creeds and god word it selfe that hee is the creator of all things both visible and inuisible therefore though wee knowe not what day the third heauen was made yet is it sufficient that here is said it was made and built by god himselfe whereupon it necessarily followeth it is a creature and not coeternall with the godhead secondly here appeares the weakenesse of one of the commonest arguments vsed for the defence of the vbiquitie and consubstantiation christ say they is present bodily in the eucharist and they prooue it thus christ is in heauen and hee is god but heauen is euery where for god is euery where and where god is there heauen is as where the king is there the court is therefore christ may be in the sacrament and yet be in heauen notwithstanding i answer the ground is false heauen is not euery where for then it is in hell which to affirme is absurditie confusion and impietie indeede god presence is euery wher and where his presence is there is his power as where the kings presence is there is also his power and authoritie and there may be any seate or course of iustice and so where he is the court is but if you take the court for some one of his chiefe houses then the saying is not true but contrariwise as the kings power is wheresoeuer his presence is and yet hee may haue one house more sumptuous and magnificent than all the rest which may bee called his court by an excellency aboue other and that court is not alwaies where the king is but in some set and certaine place and not remoueable so god power and glory is euery where and yet his most glorious court the third heauen is not euery where but in his limited and appointed place where god glory shineth more than in any other place againe if heauen properly taken be euery where then it is god himselfe for that that is euery where must needes be deified and indeede some to maintaine this opinion haue said little lesse but if the holy ghost may moderate this disputation hee plainely tells vs here that god is the maker amp builder of it therfore assuredly it is not god but one of god creatures thirdly and lastly let vs obserue the description of heauen included in these two words maker and builder god made it that is it is one of his creatures hee made it as well as the rest and he builded it that is as the word signifieth made it with arte or he bestowed skill and wisdome vpon it for though we may not imagine any substantiall difference between these two words for matter yet in signification they differ and so farre wee are to obserue it here then wee learne that the third heauen is like a peece of worke wherein an excellent workeman hath spent his arte and shewed his skill that is that the highest heauen is a most glorious place and surpasseth all other creatures of god in glory and excellency so farre as therein shineth the glory skill and wisedome of the creator more than in any other creature in which regard it is no maruell though the holy ghost say in another place that the eie hath not seene nor the eare heard nor mans heart conceiued what god hath there prepared for them that loue him corinthian and saint paul himselfe though hee had the honour to be taken vp into this third heauen and to see and heare the glory which is there yet afterwards could not he expresse the glory hee had seene and this was figured in the temple of ierusalem which was the mirrour and beauty of the world for the building whereof god both chose the skilfullest man and endued them also with extraordinary gifts namely bezaleel and aholiab now as thereby that temple was the most excellent piece of worke that euer was in this world made by man so the highest heauen which was mystically prefigured in salomons temple is the most excellent of all the workes of god the vse of this doctrine is not to be omitted first if that bee so excellent and glorious a place wee must all labour to come thither for aboue all things it seemes worthy to be sought for people come out of all places of the countrey to dwell in great townes and rich cities and man labour to be free man there and to haue their children free in them and euen the greatest man will haue their houses either in or neere them that so though they will not alwaies dwell in them yet they may soiourne in them at their pleasures now and then and why all this but because first they are places beautifull and many waies pleasant to the eie secondly full and frequented with the best company thirdly replenished with aboundance of all things needfull for mans life for necessitie comfort and delight fourthly they enioy many priuiledges and freedomes and lastly all this is most true of such cities where the king keepes his court if this bee so then how is heauen to bee sought for behold here a goodly citie a citie of god whereof london paris rome venice nay ierusalem are scarce shadowes the true ierusalem the ioy of the whole earth nay the ioy of the world and the glory of all god creatures made immediately with the hand and built with the skill and cunning of god himselfe the princes of the world amp euen of rome it selfe wondred at the beauty and were amazed at the magnificence of ierusalems city amp temple amp yet it was but a type and figure hereof for that had indeed the glory of the world vpon her but the new ierusalem hath the glory of god vpon her reu shall we then seeke to dwell in the cities of this world and not labour to come to heauen are they any way excellent wherein heauen is not much more to be desired are they beautifull and is not it the beauty of the world read the chapter of the reuelation and suppose that the beauty of it were but outward and worldly and sensible to humane capacitie yet is it farre more excellent than euer any was in this world and is not there the company of the deitie of christs humanity of the holy angels and all good man and is not there aboundance of whatsoeuer belongs to perfect happinesse and is not there freedome from the diuell sinne and death and is it not the court of god the king of glory then why doe we not sigh and grone and long to be free man of this glorious citie and though we cannot come to it as long as wee liue in this world yet why doe wee not striue to come as neere it as may bee in this world when a man cannot dwell in the heart of a citie yet he will rather dwell in the suburbs than hee will not be neere it and beeing there he knowes he can soone steppe into the citie so let vs in this life come as neere heauen as wee may let vs get into the suburbs and dwell there the suburbs of heauen is god true church on earth where his word is freely knowen and preached and his holy sacraments administred and therein god truely serued let vs associate our selues to this church and liue according to the holy lawes thereof this is the suburbs of heauen so shall we be ready to enter into the glorious city it selfe when the lord calles vs and as this is for our selues so if wee loue our children or care for their advancement let vs make them free man of that citie whose maker and builder is god so shall we bee sure to haue comfort and ioy of them here and with them in heauen but if wee will haue them free man in heauen wee must make them god apprentizes on earth they must serue out their time else they get no freedome this time is all their life man are deceiued that let their children bee the diuels slaues here and thinke to haue them free in heauen let vs then binde our children prentizes to god that is make them his servant here then assuredly as in their repentance and regeneration here they are borne free man of heauen so after this life they shall inioy the freedomes and priuiledges of that heauenly citie which was made and built by the wisdome of god lastly here wee see how true it is that dauid teacheth psalm no vile person can come in heauen and no maruell for if man thus and thus defamed cannot be free man in the cities on earth built by man is it likely that sinners and profane man that care not for repentance amp regeneration for they bee the vile man shall be admitted into that city whose maker and builder is god it is the holy citie no vncleane thing can enter into it revelation it is god holy mountaine how shall vngodlinesse ascend thither psalm it is the newe ierusalem how shall the olde man that is sinnefull corruption get into it wee must therefore cast off the olde man with his lusts and bee renewed in holinesse we must become penitent sinners for our liues past and newe man for hereafter or else let vs not looke to haue any part in heauen and good reason for god is the maker and builder of it but hee is not the maker of sinne but the diuell and our selues brought it out and thinke we the diuels worke shall come in heauen or that god will build a house for the diuels slaues to dwell in let vs not be deceiued but contrariwise grace and holinesse is god worke as our soules and body were the worke of his hands so our regeneration is much more the worke of his owne power and mercie that man therefore who can say god as once hee made me a man so hee hath againe made and built me a new man and a new creature that man is he that shal be an inhabitant in that heauenly city whose maker and builder is the same god in this holy way of faith and repentance did the holy fathers walke to this city as dauid saith in the name of them all thus i will waite for thee in holinesse psalm and thus doubtlesse did the noble patriarke abraham who as hee was the father of our faith so was hee also a patterne of repentance amp holy life amp in that holines he waited for this city that hath a foundation whose maker and builder is god hitherto we haue heard the holy practice of abrahams faith in two examples there is much more spoken of the excellency of his faith but by the way the holy ghost interlaceth a worthy example euen of a womans faith namely sarah his wife the sixt example in the order of the whole followeth in the words of the two next verses by faith euen sarah also receiued strength to conceiue seede and was deliuered of a childe when she was past age because shee iudged him faithfull which had promised next to abraham who is called the father of our faith or of faithful me followeth sarah who was also mystically the mother of beleeuers next to the husband followeth the wife nay abrahams faith is commended both before her and after her and hers inclosed in the midst by the way here obserue how god honours holy mariage and obserues the decorum and dignitie of it hee not only allowes or commends the faith of abel who it may be was vnmaried but as wee see of maried man also and it is worthy our obseruation that of all these whom the holy ghost here records for their faith and holinesse they were all maried except abel of whom it is not certaine whether he were or no it appears therefore that god as he ordained holy mariage so he alwaies honored it both with his grace on earth and his glory in heauen as well if not better than any other state of life they therefore doe spit in the face of god himselfe who any way disgrace it and they especially who allow fornication or adulterie in any sort of man rather than it as some papists doe but here wee may obserue further how god maintaines the dignity amp decorum of it he placeth abraham and sarah together and puts none between them to shewe the inseparable vnitie that is to be between them so farre as that eue in storie they are to be set together and how hainous their presumption is that dar any way attempt to separate or part that vnitie he placeth abraham first to shewe the dignitie and preheminence of the man whom for her sinne god hath set ouer her not only for her head but for her guide amp gouernour and to teach the man that he and his example should be first and should bee a light vnto her to shame them who come behinde their wiues in faith and holines he placeth abraham both afore and after her and her in the midst to teach her that her glory and honour euery way is in the vertue and worthinesse of her husband her head vnder god who is to goe before her to giue her good example and to come after to ouersee her courses and on all sides to be a shelter and defence vnto her these things may not vnfitly be noted in this contextion now let vs come to the words wherein are these points who beleeued euen sarah what shee beleeued god promise to beare isaac the impediments of that faith which were two her age her barrennesse the effects of this her faith which were three thereby shee conceiued seed brought forth isaac had a great ssue and posteritie by him the ground of her faith shee iudged him faithfull which had promised all these are laid downe in this verse or the next the first point is the person of whom this storie is sarah a woman euen shee beleeued we haue heard some examples of notable man but he hold here a woman chronicled for her faith and holy obedience as well as man where we learne that sauing faith and consequently saluation it selfe is not proper to one sexe but to both man amp woman the woman indeed was the first that brought in sin and beeing deceiued her selfe by the diuell shee deceiued man in which sense the apostle saith tim the man was not deceiued but the woman and shee was in the transgression and for that cause grieuous calamities and much bitternesse was laid vpon that sexe in bearing and bringing vp children and in subiection in which regards they might thinke themselues forsaken of god for their fault for the preuenting whereof the apostle here or rather the holy ghost by him teacheth vs that true faith and saluation by the messias belongeth to sarah as well as abraham to woman as well as to man and saint peter also most plainely pet teacheth vs that they are heires together with their husbands of the grace of life the vse whereof as it discouereth the monstrous and vnnaturall madnesse of some man who haue called into question the possibility of their saluation yes some whether they haue soules or no so it giueth encouragement to woman to serue that god in zeale and sinceritie which hath bin so mercifull vnto their sinne and who though he hath subiected them in body vnto their husdands yet hath made their soules partakers with them of the same hope of immortall life yet withall we may obserue how few the holy ghost here recordeth namely but one or two woman amongst many man for so it hath beene in all ages those that haue beene good were excellent but they were fewe in comparison of man which as it is the more commendation to them that are good so it must stirre vp all woman professing religion to labour in the imitation of the faith of their grandmother sarah that so they may be some of those fewe but let vs enter into further and more particular consideration who this sarah was especially seeing shee is the onely woman of the iewes nation whose faith is here remembred shee was the wife of abraham the grand patriarch of the age between the flood and the giuing of the lawe and of her we read this storie amongst other gen god by his angel appearing to her husband and her made a promise that within the yeare they should haue a son both heard it and both laughed to heare it abraham in ioy and admiration and therefore was not reproued shee in doubtfulnesse and a conceipt of almost impossibilitie and was for it sharpely reprooued of the angel yet behold this sarah that eue now laughed to heare such a promise as beeing a fond conceipt and meere impossible yet afterward beleeueth and in so good a measure as her faith is here registred to all posterities in her example we may learne a good lesson it was a bad thing in sarah to laugh at god word though it seemed neuer so high aboue her conceipt but it was good amp commendable that shee correcteth her fault and testifieth her amendment by beleeuing wee all followe sarahs fault but fewe her repentance many in our church are mockers of our religion and of the ministers and professors thereof and all religion that standeth not with their humour is no more regarded of them than toyes or deuises and they are counted fooles or hypocrites that thinke otherwise but alas these man know not how vile a sinne they commit while they laugh at god word for if her fault was such who laughed at that that seemed to her almost impossible and yet without any profanenesse what shal become of them that out of their carnalitie and fleshly profanenesse do make but a sport at all god ordinances promises and commandements and at all religion more than serueth their owne turne let such man be warned to cease mocking and lay aside reuiling of others and begin in soberly and seriously to beleeue else they will finde it sharpe kicking against the pricke and dangerous playing with edge tooles furthermore sarah that laughed in doubting yet withall beleeues this teacheth vs that true faith is ioyned alwayes with doubting in all god children if any obiect that followeth not here for she first doubted and then beleeued when she doubted she beleeued not and when she beleeued she doubted not i answere it is not so but the contrary as i will proue for sarah was no infidell vtterly to denie and gaine say god word when shee heard it but onely finding it in all reason impossible shee therefore presently yeelded not to it but laughed at it as a matter past ordinary course yet withall she regarded who spake it namely god and therefore forthwith iudged it possible with god though impossible in reason and so at last constantly beleeued it yet stil her reason gaine saying it so that she neuer doubted so but that she in some part beleeued it and when she beleeued it most stedfastly yet shee something doubted of it reason saide it could not be faith saide it might be therefore as when reason ouer ruling yet shee had some sparkes of faith so when her faith was predominant there remained some reliques of doubting for as reason cannot ouerthrowe true faith so the best faith in this world cannot fully vanquish reason this is the doctrine of god word mark iesus bidding the father of the childe possessed to beleeue and then his childe should be dispossessed he answered crying with teares lord i beleeue helpe my vnbeliefe there is faith and vnbeliefe in one soule at one time in one action vpon one obiect and what is vnbeliefe but doubting or worse and christ often reproueth his disciples for their doubting and calls them o ye of little faith and yet all know that that they then had true faith yes s peter himselfe most famous for his faith is reproued in y e same words o thou of litle faith wherefore didst thou doubt he had a little faith therefore some faith a little faith therefore much doubting therefore it is apparant a man may haue in his soule at once both faith and doubting yes commonly we haue a graine of mustard seede or a mite of faith and a mountaine of doubting the vse of his doctrine first discouereth the nakednesse of many professing themselues christians who care not how they liue yet say they beleeue in christ and looke to be saued by him aske how they know it they answer they know no other aske when they began they say they did euer so aske if they doubt they answere they would be ashamed so to doe but alas heere is nothing but ignorance and presumption our religion can neuer be disgraced by such man for they haue it not they knowe it not for if they did they would shame to answere so these man haue no faith at all for where it is doubting doth alwaies shewe it selfe and hee that knowes hee beleeues knowes also hee doubts and the more hee beleeues the more hee knoweth and feeleth his doubting for where these two are they are alwaies opposite and shewe their contrary natures the one is the spirit the other is flesh and corruption and these saith the apostle doe lust one against another galath he therefore that thinketh he is wholly spirit and hath no flesh or orruption in him is nothing but corruption and he that imagineth he hath perfect faith and no doubting hath no faith at all in him but carnall presumption secondly here is comfort to all such as haue faith amp grace and yet are daily troubled with temptations let not such be dismayed though they finde in themselues much doubting and diffidence for sarah beleeued and yet she doubted yes notwithstanding all her doubting she beleeued so excellently as her faith is here made a patterne to all holy ma rones for euer he therefore that is euen buffeted by sathan with teptations of doubting let not him be dismayed as though he had no faith but let him be assured his doubting doth not bewray it selfe but that faith makes the opposition and therefore let him striue with teares and prayers to god and say lord i beleeue helpe thou my vnbeliefe thus we see the person who sarah but what is the action which she did it is implied in these words through faith sarah ampc her action is she beleeued this vertue of faith and this action of beleeuing is the matter of all this chapter these holy man and woman had other holy vertues but their faith is that alone which is here commended now particularly for sarahs faith heere is one notable thing to be ob erued the very same word of god which she beleeued and for beleeuing wherof she is here registred at he same she also laughed but behold her faith is recorded her laughing is not her faith is comended her fault silenced in which holy amp merciful practice of god we learn first that god accepteth true faith though it be attended with many inf mities as a king is content to giue a begger n almes though hee receiue it with a hand shaking with the palsey so god is well pleased with our faith though diseased with infirmities and bestoweth grace on a beleeuing soule though shaken with many temptations in a word god accepteth soundnesse of faith though it be but small and more lookes at in his mercy a mans little faith then his many faults hee will not breake the bruised reede nor quench the smoking flaxe esay when a man is broken in heart and deiected in soule in fight of his many sinnes and little grace god will not breake this bruised reede but will comfort and strengthen him and when any life of grace appeares in a manne as flaxe that smoketh but will not burne out god will not quench it but will rather kindle it and giue life vnto it let this teach vs to take in good part the holy and honest endeuours of our brother though they cannot doe so well as they would or should let vs not exact too much and too hastily vpon them but expect in meeknesse the working of god grace and in the meane time thinke well of sarahs faith though it be with laughing secondly here we may learne that god rather obserues and regards good things in his children then their faults and imperfections he writes vp sarahs faith he nameth not her laughing this is from the goodnesse of his nature being goodnesse it selfe and therefore most easily apprehendeth and takes notice of the least goodnesse where euer hee findes it thus should wee deale one with another what good thing we see in any man we should obserue amp commend it his faults we should not see but couer and omit them but the course is contrary the common table talke of the world is nothing but of mens faults and to rip vp their imperfections but if they haue neuer so many good properties we can burie them all or passe them ouer in silence this argueth the malice and the naughtinesse of our nature which being euill doth delight in nothing but euill and being corrupt feedes as doth the filthy horse flie on nothing but corruption but let vs remember the practice of god and learne to conceale faults and vse our tongues to talke of the good things and vertues in our brother so shall we resemble the lord who though sarah laughed not in a holy admiration but in vnbeliefe yet forasmuch as afterward shee beleeued god hath matched her with the notablest beleeuers and holiest man that haue beene in the world thus much for the first point the person and her action she beleeued now the second is what she beleeued included and necessarily implied in the last words of the verse she iudged him faithfull which had promised the thing she beleeued was the word or promise of god particularly his promise that shee should beare isaac in her olde age of which promise and the circumstances of it we may reade gen ampc here the onely question is by what faith she beleeued this and the answere is by true sauing faith and it is proued thus abraham beleeued this promise by the faith that iustified him rom but abraham and sarah beleeued it both by one faith therefore sarah beleeued that promise by the faith that also iustified her where we learne that sauing faith apprehendeth not onely the great promise of redemption by christ but all other inferiour promises that depend vpon it for here wee see abraham and sarah take hold of the promise of a temporal blessing by the same faith whereby formerly they had laide holde on the promise of eternall saluation by the messias so that the obiect of true faith is principall the promise of saluation by christ secondarie all inferiour promises annexed thereunto the maine promise is so god loued the world that he gaue his onely begotten son to the end that whosoeuer beleeueth in him should not perish but haue eternall life john now true faith first of all directly and plainly fastneth it selfe on this but after and with this on all other promises that concerne soule or body in the lord prayer we are bid to pray for temporal blessings health peace competencie of wealth amp all other vnder the name of daily bread and we are bound to beleeue that god will giue them if wee aske in faith neither is this faith constrained but free and voluntarie and on a good foundation for being perswaded that god accepteth vs in christ for saluation we cannot but withall be perswaded that god will giue vs all things else needefull for vs this wee heere note againe because wee are wrongfully charged by the papists to hold that faith apprehendeth the promise of saluation alone but we passe it ouer for that we haue already spoken something of it now followeth the third point namely the impediments of her faith in these words when she was past age the promise was to haue a childe she beleeued it now against child bearing there are two impediments barrennesse age if one be aged or past the ordinarie time it is hard and vnlikely but if one be very aged and farre past it it is impossible shee should conceiue and beare a childe thus it stands in reason besides though one be not past age yet if she be barren as some by secret reasons in nature are it is not to be expected she should conceiue now both these lay in sarahs way for here it is said she was past age and another place namely gen saith she was barren but it may be obiected against sarahs age that in the olde time they had children till they were of great age eua had her son sheth at yeares olde gen for adam and eue must needes be both of one age and after that eue bore many sonnes and daughters therfore it may seeme that sarah was not past age at yeares olde but we are to knowe that they who began to beare at that age liued eight or nine hundred yeares but sarah liued after the floud when ages were brought downe to and for the most part to yeares abraham liued but yeares and sarah but she therefore who liued yeares and died an olde woman must needes be past age of child bearing at yeares olde and besides her age she was also barren by her naturall constitution as many are and haue beene and brought abraham no children yet vnto this woman comes a word from god sarah shall beare a son and behold this aged and barren woman doth not obiect desperatly these her two hinderances the one whereof in reason is sufficient against childe bearing but beyond all impediments and aboue reason beleeueth it shall be so resting and relying onely and wholly on god word for it the vse of which notable and faithfull practice so wonderful in a woman must teach vs to rest on god word amp promise though we haue no reason so to doe for example when we see our friends or childrens body cast into the earth to feede wormes burnt by fire or eaten by fish reason saith they are gone they can neuer be againe we haue god word and assured promise the dead shall rise with their body shall they rise esay wee must therefore beleeue it if we will be of the faith of sarah god said to her age and barronnesse shall haue a childe she beleeued it he saith to vs dust and rottennesse shall liue againe nay hee hath often said it and shall not our faith acknowledge the voice of our god and beleeue it as she did but let vs come to personall promises as hers was for this is generall god hath promised grace and pardon to euery penitent and beleeuing soule yet no man is partaker of the sweetnesse hereof without the bitternesse of many temptations to the contrary giuing him occasions of doubting and often euen of despairing of god fauour what must a man doe in this case euen beleeue though he feele no reason why to beleeue and hope aboue hope such was abrahams and sarahs faith and for it as they were registred in the storie of genesis so both here and in the romanes chap remembred againe and commended for it now suppose that thou after thy comming to god by faith amp repentance fall into temptations of desertion wherein to thy feeling god heauy hand amp wrath hath seized on thee amp the diuell layeth thy sins to thy charge amp tels thee thou article a damned wretch for thou wert euer an hypocrite and neuer hadst faith amp that therfore god is thy enemy in this case wherein in reason or in feeling there is not the least hope of saluation what must thou doe despaire god forbid for that is the downfall into hell no but hope when there is no hope keepe faith when there is no feeling and to strengthen vs herein remember the faith of iob tried and sifted so as fewe haue beene who though the arrowes of the almighty stucke in him and the venome thereof drunke vp his spirits iob yet euen then he beleeued and would not giue ouer nor let goe his hold and said though thou bring me to dust yet will i not forsake thee no though thou kill me yet will i trust in thee so in the furie of temptations when the venome of god wrath seemes to drinke vp our spirits then must we beleeue and in the pangs of death when god seemes ready to kill vs then must wee trust in him in such cases is the life of faith to be shewed when reason and feeling say god is a terrible iudge faith must say he is a mercifull father in our health and welfare and feeling of god fauour this exhortation may seeme tedious but if wee belong to god if it be not past already the time is sure to come when this doctrine will bee needefull for the best of vs all thus we see the excellencie of this womans faith which is the more commended by reason of these two so great hinderances now follow the effects of her faith which are diverse some laide downe in this verse and some in the next in these words are two effects first by power of her faith shee was inabled to conceiue which afore she did not though there were the same reasons in nature why she should secondly shee was deliuered of a childe in her olde age and that childe was isaac who is therefore called the promised seede and the childe of the promise out of the consideration of these two we may learne diverse good instructions for seeing they are so neere a kin in their natures wee will speake of them both ioyntly together first here we may see that nothing is so hard or difficult which god hath promised but faith can compasse it and bring it to performance christ b d the blinde see the lame to goe he spake they beleeued and they were healed so here god promiseth a barren olde woman a childe shee beleeueth and loe she conceiueth and brings forth a son the vse of this doctrine is for two sorts of people first many in our church being ignorant when they are moued to learne religion answere alas they are simple or not booke learned or they are dull and heauy witted or they be olde and weake and therefore they can learne nothing or if they doe they cannot remember it but heere is nothing but vaine excuses for they want not wit to learne religion if they haue wit to buy and sell to knowe a faire day from a foule good meate from ill deere from cheape winter from sommer if they haue wit to practice the ciuill actions of the world they haue wit enough to conceiue the grounds of religion and to get so much knowledge as may suffice for a ground of that faith which will saue their soules so that they want nothing but grace and diligence to vse the meanes to them therfore here is matter of good aduice let such a man learne but one promise of god out of the holy scripture as this seeke first the kingdome of god and all things else shall be giuen vnto you math or this cast all your care on him for he careth for you pet or this he that cometh vnto me i cast him not away john or but this aske and ye shall haue seeke and ye shall finde math let him learne but one of these amp when they haue learned it beleeue it and let their soules daily feede on that faith and they shall see what will followe euen a wonderfull blessing vpon that poore beginning this their faith will so content and please their hearts that it will vrge them forward to get more and will make them both desirous amp capable of more knowledge and grace and will make them euen hunger and thirst after knowledge and grace whereas he that knoweth no promise nor beleeues it contents himselfe in ignorance and errour and this shall euery one finde that will carefully vse the meanes that god appoints and will begin to learne but one lesson at the first for as olde barren sarah beleeuing god promise conceiues and brings forth so olde simple plaine dull country man beleeuing but one promise of god word shall conceiue and bring forth daily more and more blessed fruites of knowledge and grace secondly others who haue made better proceedings in religion doe see their sinnes and doe much bewaile them but they cannot ouercome their corruptions yes many there are to whom their sinnes and inward corruptions are more greeuous and burdensome then all bodily wants or miseries in the world yet see they not how to conquer their corruptions but alas are oftentimes foiled by them to their great discomfort let these man know the want of faith is the cause hereof for that they doe not sufficiently ruminate and consider the promises of god made in that behalfe nor vse the meanes god hath appointed to the vse whereof hee hath annexed his promises of helpe against sinne let them therefore lay god word and promises vnto their consciences in holy and frequent meditations let them carefully vse the meanes god hath appointed hearing and reading his word receiuing the holy communion earnest and frequent prayer crauing also the prayers of others and let them sharpen these holy exercises by fasting watching holy conferences with others visitations of others afflicted like themselues oft reuealing their estate to their godly pastors let them continue thus doing and rest confidently on the word and promise of god with the stedfast foote of faith and they shall see that olde sarah shall haue strength to conceiue that is that their poore soules shall receiue strength to tread vpon sathan to conquer their corruptions amp to conceiue amp bring forth many worthy fruites of holinesse to their ioy and comfort in their later experience as isaac was to sarah in her elder age the next doctrine we may here learne is that whereas sarah by her faith in god promise conceiues and brings forth therefore children are the immediate blessing of the lord for sarah bare isaac not by any ordinary strength or power of nature but through faith shee receiued strength to conceiue ampc neither is this so in her onely wherein there was a miraculous worke of god power but in all some are indeede barren by constitution and these cannot conceiue vnlesse by god power as sarah did but some haue no children who in all naturall reason might conceiue for as god gaue the lawe and thereby a gift and power to encrease and multiply genesis so he reserued the execution of it to himself and power to alter or dispense to adde or diminish as it pleaseth him therefore saith the psalmist psalm lo children are the inheritance of the lord and the fruite of the wombe is his reward and speaking of them psalm he saith loe thus shall he be blessed that feareth the lord the vse is to teach parents therefore to bring them vp as god blessings and not onely to giue them corporall necessities for so they doe their beast but to nurture them in holy discipline by sowing the seedes of religion in their hearts if this they want they haue nothing though you leaue them earledomes and heerein is the saying true better vnborne then vntaught the lawe and power to encrease and multiplie is giuen to beastes in their kinde as well as to vs genesis verse therefore vnlesse wee doe more then prouide for their body wee differ little from them but make them know god and so wee make them fellowes with the angelles if parents did thus it cannot bee expressed what blessinges would come thereby to church and commonwealth thirdly and lastly let vs heere knowe and learne that this holy matron sarah figureth vnto vs mysticallie the spirituall hierusalem the church of god allego ies are charily and sparingly to bee taught else much vnsounde doctrine may cumber mennes consciences but this is sound and sure for it is the apostles galath ampc by agar and sarah other things are meant for these two mothers are two testaments agar shee which gendreth vnto bondage sarah hierusalem which is free and from aboue and is the mother of vs all now the resemblance between naturall sarah the wife of abraham and mysticall sarah the spouse of christ the church of god stands in this that as she not by power in her selfe but by god power and faith in his promise bare isaac so the church our mother bringeth forth children to god onely by the power of god word and spirit and therefore as isaac is called the childe of promise and said to be borne by promise galath so man regenerate and borne to the church are said not to be borne of bloud nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but of god john and s iames saith god of his owne will begat vs with the word of truth thus the word of god amp the will that is the spirit of god these two together beget children to the church the vse is to teach vs all to honour the church as our mother but to worship god alone who is the father of our soule the church cannot make her selfe our mother no vs her children when she will but it is god that must speake the word and then we are made he must beget vs by the power of his spirit and ministerie of his word and further let vs learne heere what account wee are to make of god holy word which is the immortall seede of our regeneration whereby wee are made god children and heires of immortality thus much of the two first effects of her faith the third is laid downe in the next verse which because it is much stoode vpon by the holy ghost we will put it off till then being therefore worthy our deeper consideration and now followeth in the end of this verse the fift and last point which is the ground of her faith because she iudged him faithfull which had promised the foundation whereon she built this her faith that she should haue a son being barren and past age was not the bare promise of god so much as the conceite or opinion shee had of him that promised for promises are not of value so much by the things promised though neuer so great or excellent for they may promise much who can performe nothing or though they can yet wil recall their word in lightnesse and inconstancie as by the worthinesse of the party promising we say in this world we had rather haue some mens word then other mens bond and rather haue a little promised of some then much of others now such was the iudgement that sarah helde of him that promis namely god she iudged him faithfull which had promised faithfull that is shee iudged him able amp willing to accomplish what euer hee promised to her so that the grounds of our faith in god and all his promises must be a sure apprehension and knowledge of these two things in god his ability to make good what euer passeth him in word his carefulnesse to doe it when hee hath said it some wil promise any thing though their ability stretch not to performe others are able enough but haue no care of their word but both these are in god all sufficient ability and most carefull willingnesse so sarah iudged of god and therefore shee beleeued against reason and so must wee doe if wee will beleeue god word aright wee may reade and heare and knowe god word and haue the points therein swimming in our heads but if wee will constantly beleeue with our hearts his blessed promises amp in our consciences feare his threatnings we must be fully perswaded of these two to be in him so are wee taught by christ the wisedome of god in the lord prayer afore wee pray for any thing to bee resolued of god power and will to heare and helpe vs he is our father therefore carefull and willing he is in heauen and therefore able to heare vs and to giue vs all thinges math and the same commendation here giuen to sarah is also giuen to abraham rom he doubted not but beleeued aboue hope ampc being fully assured that he which had promised was also able to doe it the vse hereof vnto vs is double first to aduise and guide vs for our promises not to be too recklesse as some are what we promise but to consider aforehand and if it be beyond our power not to speake the word for christian mens words must not be vaine and if we haue promised any thing lawful and in our power to be carefull to performe it thus to doe is to be a faithfull man and is a good signe of a holy man and god childe prouided this be so first of all towards god that wee make conscience of performing the great vow wee made in our baptisme and all other serious amp holy purposes of our heart made to god for otherwise hee that breakes his vowe to god carelesly by liuing profanely hee may in worldly policy keepe is word but he cannot doe it in conscience the church of rome is foully faulty in this point making no conscience of breaking promise and faith with vs or any of our religion their nakednesse herein is discouered in the face of all christendom let them that are wi e be warned of it they make great ostentation of their vowes and of their care to performe them aboue any other religion but it appeares hereby to be vile hypocrisie for if they were conscionably and not politikely and formally carefull of their vowes of chastity pouerty amp others made to god they could not but be likewise carefull of their promises made to man for the one of these is the fountaine a d roote of the other but the neglect of the one sheweth the formality and hypocrisie of the other let all that feare god learne to make conscience of both these in their religion and seruice of god and in all their dealings with man in the world that so the world may iudge vs faithfull man when we haue promised secondly let vs here learne how to helpe and strengthen our weake faith in the great promises of god wee haue a promise of saluation whosoeuer beleeueth in christ shall not perish but haue life euerlasting of our resurrection daniel they tha sleepe i the dust shall rise againe of our glorification philip the lord iesus shal change our vile body and make them like to his owne glorious body of a new world pet we looke for new heauens and a new earth according to his promise these be as s peter calls them great and pretious promises pet and surely it must be a great amp pretious faith that can constantly beleeue these no better helpes of our faith can there be then often and seriously to consider of the mercy and power of him that made them if he be willing and able what can let the performance of them let vs therefor often say with holy paul faithfull is hee which hath promised who will also doe it thess and with sarah here we iudge him faithfull which hath promised now followeth the last effect in the next verse the third and last effect of sarahs effect is that by this son isaac whom she conceiued amp brought forth by faith she had a wonderfull great issue and a posterity almost without number this effect consists not of it selfe but depends vpon the former her faith gaue her strength to conceiue isaac though she were barren and to bring him forth though she were olde and weake and so her faith brought him out by whom shee was made the mother of many millions of man the matter of this third effect is the multitude of man that came of abraham and sarah by isaac this posterity or multitude is described by two arguments by the beginning or roote of it one that was as dead the quantity or greatnesse laid downe generally to be a multitude and innumerable particularly by two comparisons as many as the starres in the skie as the sands by the seashore the first point is the roote and beginning of this multitude in these words and therefore sprang there of one euen one that was as dead one that is one woman sarah or at the most one couple abraham and sarah and this one was no better then dead not dead properly and fully for none are so dead whose soules and body are not separate but as dead that is as good as dead or halfe dead meaning that they were altogether vnfit for generation of children the strength of nature being decayed in them abraham being and sarah yeares olde and if this be true of abraham who was past age how much more is it of sarah who was both past age and was also barren in her best age here we are to note and learne many things first multitudes came of one see here the powerfull and yet the ordinary workes of god to reare vp goodly amp huge buildings vpon small and weake foundations so did he in the beginning and euer since indeede he made at the first thousands of starres because they must be no more then at the first they were and millions of angels intending they shall not multiply he could also haue made millions of man in a moment he would not but onely one couple adam and eue and of them came the infinite race of mankinde when sinne had made an end of that world hee founded not the second that yet continueth vpon a thousand couples but by three man and their wiues hee multiplied the whole race of mankinde which since haue growen from three to millions of millions and so here of one olde man and a barren olde woman spring innumerable multitudes this god doth to magnifie his owne power in the eyes of the sonnes of man and so he did also in matters heauenly the number of christians since christ that haue grown to millions began in a poore number at the first for when christ himselfe was ascended the number of knowen beleeuers was but acts the consideration hereof should teach vs all these duties first not to measure god by our lengthes nor to tye him to our rules but to esteeme of his power and might as we see it deserues and to entertaine high and honourable thoughts of him amp his maiestie who can reare vp so great workes vpon so poore foundations secondly not to despaire of our selues or our estates though we think our selues neuer so weak so poore so sick either in soule or body but to remember him that of one made multitudes to spring out therefore when thou article brought neuer so low either in soule or body by any miseries either inward or outward faint not but goe forward in the strength of the lord thy god particularly if god haue afflicted thee with pouerty that thou haue almost nothing to begin withall or for thy soule is thy knowledge in religion small thy meanes poore thy feeling of god fauour but weake yet faint not but lay fast hold on god power amp promise vse carefully the holy means god hath ordained remembring and relying on him who made millions grow out of one and assure thy self that as iob saith though thy beginnings be small yet thy later endes shall greatly encrease secondly obserue here how old persons are called halfe dead or as good as dead amp that is true of them many wayes first their yeares and dayes limited them are as good as gone for suppose a man should be as sure to liue yeares as the sun is to runne all the day long his course and at night to goe downe yet as when the sun is past the height and drawing downward wee say it goeth fast downe and the day hasteth away so when a man is past his middle age when the sun of his life is past the noonsteede he declineth daily and draweth fast away and the night of his life approacheth with hast and much horrour vnlesse he preuent it secondly their strength amp vitall powers by which their life is continued and their soules and body kept together are so much weakened that they are almost extinguished whereby it comes to passe an olde man may feele a manifest defect in all powers of minde and body thirdly sicknesses or diseases grow vpon them in olde age and as their strength faileth so the force of diseases is redoubled on them and looke what diseases haue lurked in their body which either naturally were bred in them or accidentally taken they now shew themselues more sensibly and the weaker a man is the stronger is his sicknesse in these three respects an olde man or woman is as good as dead the vse hereof is profitable first they must therefore be aduised to prepare themselues for death euery man is to prepare i confesse then if euerie man especially they that be olde the young man may die the olde man must die the youngest cannot liue alwayes the olde man cannot liue long the aged mans graue is as it were made already amp his one foote is in it and this is not mans conceit alone but god own iudgement who as we see here calls an olde man as good as dead and that not so much in regard that he is sure to die as that he is neere it therefore as euery man young or olde is to make ready because his time is vnknowne and no man is sure that hee shall liue to be olde and as the psalmist singeth euery man in his best estate is altogether vaenity psalm so especially he to whom god hath beene so gracious as to let him see olde age he should thinke of nothing but his end amp prepare euery day to die in the lord his gray haires his wrinkled skin his withered face his ill stomack his weak memorie his crooked body and the manifest amp most sensible alteration and decay of his whole state of minde and body should hourely all cry in his eares i am halfe dead i will therefore prepare to die in the lord it is therefore a miserable sight to see that those who of all man should be most willing to die are for the most part most desirous to liue and those who should be most readie to die are generally most ignorant most couetous and their hearts most of all wedded to the earth and earthly things secondly olde persons must heere learne s pauls lesson corinthian that as the outward man perisheth so the inward man may be renued daily the outward man is the bodie the inward man is the soule and the grace of god in it they must therefore labour that as the strength of their body decay so the grace of god in their soules may quicken and reuiue but alas the common practice is contrarie for olde man haue generally so misspent their youthes and in their olde age are partly so backward partly so vnfit to learne religion that when they come to their death beds they are then to be catechised in the very principles of religion so that when as the body is halfe dead religion hath no being in them and when the body is a dying religion and grace scarce begins to liue in them such man cast all vpon a desperate point but let them that desire a ioyfull departure thinke of these thinges afore hand and as yeares draw on and so draw life to his end and the body to the graue so let them weane their hearts from the world and lift them vp to god and so spend their last dayes in getting knowledge and in seruing god that when their body are weakest and fittest for the earth their soules may be the holiest and ripest for heauen to such man shall it neuer be discomfort to see their body halfe dead when for recompence thereof they finde their soules halfe in heauen thus we see the roote or foundotion of this posterity how poore and weake it was now let vs come to the greatnesse of it this one olde couple abraham and sarah are made by god power the father amp mother of many nation and he and she of whom the world would haue pronounced they should not haue left a name vpo the earth haue now millions of childre that sprang out of them here we may learn that though god worke ordinarily according to the course of nature which himselfe hath established yet that he is not bound to it nor will be hee bound it therefore there is no reason it should binde him here we may see the power and prerogatiue of god maiestie as in the beginning he made to be those things which were not so still he calleth things that are not as though they were rom and turneth and altreth the state and nature of his creatures as pleaseth him he can take life from the liuing man and leaue him dead hee can giue life to the dead man amp make him liue againe so hath he dealt for the body and for the soule he hath beene no lesse wonderfull saul of a bloudy persecuter he ca make a zealous preacher acts euen a glorious instrument and a chosen vessell to carie his name vnto the gentiles euen hee who thought to haue blotted out the name of christ and all that call on that name from vnder heauen acts rahab a harlot amp a comon woman yet by god work so far altred that her faith is here registred in y e ver amongst the most excellent beleeuers that haue bin in the world let this teach vs whe we see our own sins how hideous amp monstrous they be yet not to despaire and whe we see other man liue in extream dissolutenes yet not to iudge of them before the time but euen then with hope and comfort remember that god who quickneth the dead and calleth things that are not as though they were and in that hope let vs perswade our selues that he may quicken our dead hearts and reuiue vs by his grace and therefore in that hope let vs raise vp our selues to vse all holy meanes of god word sacraments and prayer which if we carefully and continually doe wee shall see wonders wrought in vs that as they saide of paul this man preacheth the faith which afore he destroyed and therefore glorified god for him galath so shall man say of vs this man hates the profanenesse that afore he liued in and loues the religion that afore hee mocked such miracles will the lord worke in vs if with faith and diligence wee vse the holy meanes that so all that see vs shall glorifie god for vs thus wee see generally how great the issue and posterity of sarah was but it is more particularly inlarged by two comparisons as many as the starres in the skie or as the sands by the sea shore which are innumerable his comparisons are two one taken from the heauens as many as the starres in the skie the other from the earth as the sands in the sea and these two are vsed by the holy ghost being things of incredible number to expresse the multitude of the israelites that came all from sarah not but that other things also are of as great number as the drops of water dust of the earth amp hairs of mens heads ampc but these two are most common and prouerbiall phrases whereby to expresse a multitude and againe the starres of the skie are rather named then any other because god himself in the beginning pleased to vse it to abraham when he had neuer a childe gen god caried abraham forth in the night and bad him count the starres if he could and said so shall thy seede be and moses afterwards vseth the same comparison deut our fathers went downe into egypt persons and now the lord hath made vs as the starres of the skie in multitude now because all man are not astronomers as abraham and moses were and that ignorant man might say they can perceiue no such matter in the starres therefore hee vseth another comparison which euery countryman may discerne how innumerable they be namely the sands of the sea shore and least any should say i dwell in the mid land country and neuer saw the sea sand and am ignorant and so cannot iudge of the starres therefore to put him out of doubt the holy ghost assures him in the end of the verse that they are both innumerable that is not in themselues or to god but in regard of man and mans skill vnable to be counted concerning these two comparisons let vs obserue the manner or the phrase of speech in them vsed secondly the matter in them intended for the first wee are to knowe that the speech is not proper but figuratiue for properly they were not as manie as the starres or as the sands neither are the starres or sands innumerable but it is a figure called by the rhetoricians which is an excesse of finenesse of speech or an excessiue elegancie and as it is ordinarie in all writers and euen in common speech so it is not refused by the holy ghost but vsed both heere and in the two forenamed places and the like also of the same nature but in other phrases in other places as saint john i suppose saith hee if all the sayings and doings of christ were written the world could not containe the bookes that would be written meaning they would be exceeding many and more then would be needefull for saluation and deuteronomie verse moses saith that the cities of the canaanites were great and walled vp to heauen meaning that they were very high and so high as was possible for cities walles to be and as was impossible to haue beene scaled in all mennes reason had not god fought for them these and such like are common in the scripture and seeing wee allowe that libertie to all writers and to our selues in common speeche no reason to denie it to the scripture which was written for all mens vnderstanding and therfore in such phrases as are vsuall and ordinarie with all man and the like liberty is heere taken also in another figure as many as the sands by the shore of the sea the word properly signifieth and soundeth the lippe of the sea now the sea hath no lippe but it is a speech taken or borrowed from man or beast who haue lippes and the sea shore resembleth a lippe for looke what a lippe is to them the shores are to the sea as the two lippes doe inclose the mouth so the two shores on both sides doe inclose the sea which lieth as in a mouth between them from hence we may learne profitable instructions first that therefore rhetoricke is a warrantable good and lawful article and it ariseth thus that which the holy ghost practiceth must needes be not onely not euill but good and warrantable but the holy ghost vseth and practiceth rhetoricke heere and in many places else of the scripture therefore it is a good and lawful arte the proposition is vndoubted the assumption is cleare both by these places and almost the whole body of the scripture many of saint pauls epistles many of christes owne sermons saint iohns gospell many of the prophets especially esayah haue as much and as elegant rhetoricke in them as any vvriters in the vvorlde and beside all other vertue and diuine power in them doe euen for figures and ornaments of arte match any oratours that haue vvritten in the greekes or latines nor would it bee anie hard taske to vndertake to prooue and illustrate euery approued rule of rhetorick out of some part of scripture now if it be lawful to practice the rules of rhetorick then is it lawful also to collect those rules together to pen them and to make an article of them they therefore that holding the contrary doe say or teach or write it is unlawful goe against the streame and common practice of the scripture and rules of common reason secondly heere it is apparant that in preaching god word it is lawful and warratable for a minister to vse rhetoricke and eloquence and the reason is good for that which the holy ghost vseth in penning of the scripture the same may god ministers vse also in preaching the same they therefore that denie that liberty to ministers are too rough and rugged and pull out of the hand of the ministers one of his weapons amp out of the wings of the scripture one of her feathers yet we must know that all or any kinde of eloquence is not permitted to a christian minister for s paul saith corinthian wee speake the words of god not in the words which mans wisedome teacheth but which the holy ghost teacheth coparing spirituall things with spirituall things so that there is a holy a sanctified a spirituall eloquence an eloquence fit for spirituall things and that eloquence must be vsed as the israelites might marie the midianite woman whom they had taken in war but not til they had purified them numb and more plainly and particularly deut moses explaneth what that purifying is and thou shalt bring her home into thine house and shee shall shaue her head and pare her nailes and put off the garment shee was taken in and then thou maist marie her so humane eloquence must be brought home to diuinitie and be pared and shaued with spirituall wisedome and then may lawfully and profitably be vsed for our more speciall direction heerein these cautions may be obserued first the more naturall it is and the lesse affected the more commendable is it in the doer and more profitable to the hearer secondly it must be graue sober and modest remembring the height and holinesse of the place a man stands in and of the worke he doth therefore it must not consist in telling strange tales or vsing such gestures or words manner or matter as may moue laughing and smiling in the auditors there may be wit in such doing but it can hardly be the sanctified and spirituall eloquence which s paul there speakes of thirdly it must be such as may be a helpe and not a hinderance to the vnderstanding of god word for it is a damosell to diuinitie but not her mistresse god word therefore must not bow and bende to her much lesse be wrung and wrested to her but she to god word it must in a word be such as may most liuely purely plainly and significantly expresse the meaning of god word therefore a man must endeuour that all his speech be in one language at least in such as his hearers vnderstand for else if he speake the body of his speech in one and peece out the members in other which the people vnderstand not hee may indeede in his owne spirit speake mysteries but to the hearer he speaketh parables and to his owne vnderstanding he may preach well but the hearer is not edified as the apostle saith corinthian therefore let not eloquence be a hinderance to the vnderstanding of the hearers which god hath ordained to be a helpe and furtherance and with these or such like qualifications eloquence may be vsed with good warrant and much profit and for cautions or qualifications heerein hardly can any man set downe better rules then euery mans conscience will vnto himselfe thirdly inasmuch as the holy ghost here and else where vseth so much rhetoricke diuines may learne where the fountaine of christian eloquence is namely in the scriptures of the olde and new testament which being compi ed by the wisdome of god wee are to assure our selues they containe in them true wisdome of all sorts precepts of rhetorick i confesse are to be learned out of other books which purposely doe each them but the practice of those rules in examples can be no where better than in moses the prophets and the euangelists and this must needes follow vpon that that hath already beene granted for if we yield that rhetoricke is good and lawful and practiced in the scripture then it must needs followe that it is there practiced in the best manner for shall the diuinitie there taught be the soundest the historie there reported the truest the conclusions of philosophie astronomy geometrie arithmeticke cosmographie and physicke there deliuered the surest the musicke there practiced the exactest the logycke there practiced the sharpest the lawes there enacted the iustest and shall not the rhetoricke there practiced bee the purest surely if moses had written a booke of his owne as he was a meere man and as he was moses brought vp in egypt or paul writ a booke as hee was a pharisie and doctor of the law they would both haue beene full of all excellent learning for paul was brought vp at the foote of gamaliel acts and moses was exceedingly learned in all the learning of the egyptians and mighty in word and deed acts shall they then bee the secretaries of the most high god the fountaine of wisdome and learning and shall not their bookes bee filled with the most excellent learning in all kinds doubtlesse who euer searcheth it shall finde it to be so seeing therefore eloquence is lawful and that preachers may lawfully vse it let them also knowe where to haue it let them study god bookes and there they shall finde not onely diuinitie but knowledge and learning of all sorts and that most exquisite and as excellent patternes and presidents of eloquence as are to bee found in any authors in the world and let them if they would preach with spirituall power and eloquence looke how moses the prophets our sauiour christ and his apostles preached for to follow them is the true way thus wee see the manner here vsed by the holy ghost in these two comparisons to describe the greatnesse of this her posteritie now the matter in them contained is that here is the performance of one of the greatest promises made to abraham the promise is genes i will surely blesse thee and greatly multiply thy seede as the starres in the heauen and as the sands by the sea shoare there is the promise and beholde here the performance in the very same wordes and that most true and effectuall for at the time when the holy ghost wrote these words the israelites were multiplied to many millions yes to a number past number so that here we learne god is true in all his promises bee they neuer so great or wonderfull if hee speake the word if the promise passe him it is sure heauen and earth shall rather passe away than any one piece of his promise shall faile the vse is to teach vs first to beleeue god when hee promiseth what euer it bee for hee is worthy to bee beleeued who neuer failed to performe what he promised he promised these millions to abraham when hee had but one childe nay when he had neuer a one genes and abraham beleeued such a faith was excellent indeede and deserues eternall commendation as here it hath let vs be children of this faithfull abraham and the rather seeing wee see the performance which he sawe not wee thinke it a disgrace if wee bee not beleeued especially if wee doe vse to keepe our word let vs then knowe thereby what dishonour it is to the lord not to beleeue him which neuer failed in the performance to any creature secondly we must here learn of god to be true and faithfull in our words and promises god spake plainly and deceaued not abraham and after at the time performed it so must we deale plainely and simply in our words and bargaines and thinke that to deceiue and ouer reach by craftie words and double meanings and equiuocall phrases are not beseeming christianity and we must make conscience of a lie else we are like the diuell and not god also a christian man must take heede what how and to whom he promiseth but hauing promised he must performe though it be losse or harme to himselfe if it be not wrong to god or to the church or state wrong to himselfe must not hinder him from performance christian mens words must not be vaine they should be as good as bonds though i know it is lawful and very conuenient in regard of mortality to take such kind of assurances lastly abraham had the promise his seed should bee so gen and here we see it is so but he himself saw it not so that abraham had the promise and we the performance so adam had the promise of the messias but wee see it performed the patriarkes and prophets the promise of the calling of the gentiles but we see it performed see heere the glory of the church vnder the new testament aboue the olde this must teach vs to be so much better then they as god is better to vs then hee was to them and to excell them in faith and all other vertues of holinesse or else their faith and their holy obedience shall turne to our greater condemnation which haue had so farre greater cause to beleeue and obey god and so farre better means than they which if it be so then alas what will become of them who come behinde them nay haue no care to followe them in their faith nor holinesse nor any duties of holy obedience thus much for the example of this holy womans faith and of the commendation thereof now before he come to any more particular examples of faith the holy ghost giues a generall commendation of the faith of all those ioyntly which are spoken of already all these died in faith and receiued not the promises but saw them afarre off and beleeued them and receiued them thankefully and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrimes on the earth hitherto the holy ghost hath particularly commended the faith of diverse holy beleeuers now from this verse to the hee doth generally commend the faith of abraham sarah isaac and iaacob together yet not so much their faith as the durance and constancy of their faith particularly the points are two the first point touching these beleeuers is that as they begun so they held on as they liued so they died in faith the trueth of the matter in the words may be referred to all afore going sauing enoch who died not yet he continued also constant in his faith and in that faith was taken vp but as for abel and noah they died in faith yet i take it that principally and directly the holy ghost intended no more than these foure i named and my reason is because the particular effects in this verse and the points whereby this their constacy is amplified in the three verses followwing adoe all agree especially with these foure and not so properly with abel or noah so that i take he meaneth by all these all these man that liued in the second world since the flood all these died in faith that is in assurance that the promises made vnto them should bee performed in god good time these promises were principally these two saluation by the messias the possession of the land of canaan in this faith they died that is they held it through all as aults and temptations to the contrary euen to the last gaspe and died therein in this their practice is commended vnto vs a most worthy lesson of christianitie namely that wee must so liue that we may die in faith many say they liue in faith and it is well if they doe so but the maine point is to die in faith there is none so ill but howsoeuer he liues yet hee would die well if hee would die well hee must die in faith for miserable is the death that is without faith and herein faith and hope differ from other graces of god loue ioy zeale holinesse and all other graces are imperfect here and are perfected in heauen but faith and hope are perfected at our death they are not in the other world for there is nothing then to be beleeued nor hoped for seeing we then doe inioy all things but as they are begunne in our life at our regeneration so they be made perfect when wee die and they shine most gloriously in the last and greatest combate of all which is at the houre of death so that the death of a christian which is the gate to glory is to die in faith besides as life leaues vs death finds vs and as death leaues vs the last iudgement finds vs and as it leaues vs so wee continue for euer and euer without recouerie or alteration now to die in faith is to die in an assured estate of glory and happinesse which is that that euery man desireth therfore as we all desire it so let vs die in faith and we shal attaine vnto it saint paul tels vs corinthian death is a terrible serpent for he hath a poisoned sting now when we die we are to encounter with this hideous and fearefull serpent he is fearefull euery way but especially for his sting that sting is our sinne and this sting is not taken away nor the force of it quenched but by true faith which quencheth all the fierie darts of the diuell ephesian if therefore wee would bee able to encounter with this great enemie in the conquering of whom who stands our happinesse and by whom to be conquered is our eternall miserie wee must then so arme our selues with faith that wee may die in faith for hee that dieth in faith that faith of his kils his sinnes and conquers death but he that dieth without faith death and sin seize on him and his sinnes liue for euer and his miserie by them now if we would die in faith we must liue in faith else it is not to be expected for so these holy patriarchs liued long in this faith wherein they died for their holy liues shewed plainely that they liued in that faith which the apostle saith doth purifie our hearts act now if wee would liue in true faith the meanes to attaine it set downe by god word are these first wee must labour to get knowledge of the fundamentall points of religion of god of the creation the fall the immortalitie of the soule the two couenants of workes by the lawe of grace by the mediator and such other substantiall points touching god his word sacraments law gospel praier good workes ampc as the scriptures and the creeds and catechismes out of the scripture doe yeeld vnto vs herein the case of the common people of all nation is miserable in popery their clergie is so fat and full they will not in our churches the ministerie a great part of it so poore and ill prouided for they cannot teach between both the people of the world do perish for lacke of knowledge for how can they but perish that die not in faith how can they die so that liue not in faith and how can they euer haue faith that haue no knowledge seeing knowledge is the foundation of faith therefore it needes the helpe of those that may and the praiers of all that our church may haue teachers and our people catechisers for without learning the catechisme it is impossible to learne religion secondly when wee haue got knowledge and so laid the foundation then must we learne the promises of god for saluation and we must hide them in our hearts as the iewels of life and saluation we must beleeue them to be true and effectuall to all that will take hold of them and wee our selues must therefore take hold of them and apply them to our soules thirdly after both these wee must conforme our selues throughout heart and life vnto the holy lawes of god we must leaue all bad waies and vngodly courses though they be neuer so deare vnto vs or so commo in the world and must make conscience of all sinne and endeauour to doe all duties to god and man the first of these is the ground of faith the second is faith it selfe the last the fruit and effect of it and an assured testimony of it to god to his church and to a mans owne conscience and to doe these three things is to walke in the olde and holy way consecrated by christs blood and troden in by all the holy fathers and popery nor any other religion can appoint so a e so sure nor so direct a way thus liued abraham sarah isaac and iaacob and after this course they died in faith and now liue in glory and so shall we with them if wee will liue in faith as they did but else we may long looke for heauen before wee come there indeed god can make a man that liued not in faith die in faith but the matter is not what he can doe but what is his ordinary course amp that is this they that liue in faith die in faith therfore let vs take the ordinary course and repent and turne betimes and liue the life of faith and leaue late repentance to them that thinke it but a sport to venture a soule that course may speed but this course is sure to speed he that liues in sin may happe to die in faith but he that liues in faith is sure to die in faith and to liue in glory for euer secondly obserue how it is said all these died in faith not some but all abraham the father and the roote and with him the wife the child and the grand child behold a true noble blood a holy kinred a blessed generation worthy is abraham of all the honour hee hath who was the roote of such a noble and blessed brood and worthy are isaac and iaacob of so good a father who stained not their blood by forsaking their faith but held it as they receiued it and liued and died in it let this teach vs first if we bee fathers to shine before our children in a holy religion true faith and good life and it is great hope that our wiues and children will follow vs in the same secondly if wee be sonnes to looke which of our fore fathers and auncestors imbraced the most holy religion and to choose and liue and die in their faith most of our yong papists can say no more for their religion but this my father and grand father were of that religion but they must looke to all their fore fathers isaac and iaacob would not be of their great grand fathers nahors or terahs religion but of their father abrahams and abraham himselfe would not be of his father terahs or his grand father nahors religion but he went vp a great deale higher to his fore fathers to the tenth generation noah and shem and imbraced their religion so that we see it is nothing to say i am of my fathers or grand fathers religion vnlesse first i prooue that theirs was of god and then hee is a noble christian man which knowing that will not forsake it but will liue and die in it thirdly see here true honour and gentry is to liue and die in the true faith and holy religion of our auncestors here is the fountaine of honour to doe as these did abraham perceiues he is wrong and erred with his fathers hee therefore leaues his fathers and grand fathers religion amp goeth vp higher and takes a better isaac his son makes himselfe heire not of his land alone but of his fathers religion also iaacob the grand childe follows both and dieth in faith with them behold here iaacob a true gentleman in blood his holinesse and religion is in the third descent let vs all learne to adorne our gentilitie and nobilitie with these ensignes of true honour and let all them that shame to staine their blood by treasons or misdemeanors shame also to let their forefathers religion holinesse or vertues faile in them but let them all so liue in them that with iaacob they may die in their fathers faith lastly obserue how it is said they died in faith they afore liued in it but now their principall commendation is they died in it let vs learne here to hold on in a good course when we haue entred into it for constancy and continuance is the true commendatio he that dieth in faith is he that receiues the crowne to this ende let vs stirre vp our selues with the apostles exhortation galath let vs not be weary of well doing for in due time we shall reape if wee faint not and further let this teach vs all to choose that faith to liue in with these holy patriarchs that wee may boldly die in it is a true obseruation that popery is a good religion to liue in but ours to die in the papists vsurpe this saying and turne it the contrary way but they haue as much right to it as the thiefe to the true mans purse the liberty the pardons dispensations sanctuaries the pompe and outward glory of their church and their fasting amp outward austerities beeing fowle and fained hypocrisies and indeede open licentiousnesse these and many things more may allure any naturall man in the world to liue in their religion but when they come to die then they all know and some confesse it is surest and safest to die in our religion let vs therefore cheerefully and comfortably liue in that religion and faith wherein wee may so boldly die that euen our aduersaries confesse it to be safest now follow the foure effects and fruits of their faith the first is this that they receiued not the promises but saw them afarre off by promises we vnderstad first the promises of the land of canaan secondly the spirituall promises of the kingdome of christ these they did not receiue that is fully thogh in part they did for true faith doth alwaies receiue apprehend and apply vnto it selfe truely though not fully the thing promised god said hee would giue them the land of canaan but they did not fully enioy and possesse it so likewise the messias was promised vnto them but they neuer saw his comming in the flesh and yet they beleeued god promise and died in that faith where wee may see the inuincible force of their faith that cleaued fast vnto the promise of god euen vnto death though they neuer enioyed the things promised in this life which plainely condemnes our age of vnbeleefe for we haue more accomplished vnto vs than euer they had abraham neuer saw christ but afarre off yet wee haue him exhibited in the flesh we see and knowe hee liued and died rose againe and ascended and now makes continuall intercession for vs and we haue the true sacraments which shall last for euer pledges of him and of life euerlasting by him and for temporall promises wee haue farre more accomplished vnto vs than euer he had but though wee goe before abraham in the fruition of god promises yet we come farre behinde him in beleefe for faith worketh by loue and loue is seene in true obedience but generally this is too true man make no conscience of obedience which sheweth vndoubtedly that there is little sound faith among vs and it may be feared that these notable man abraham isaac and iaacob shall stand in iudgement against vs to our further condemnation for they neuer receiued the accomplishing of god promises and yet they beleeued but we doe see the same fulfilled amp exhibited vnto vs and yet we will not beleeue here is the propertie of their faith and the power of it the promises were afarre off and yet they saw them the phrase here vsed is borrowed from mariners who beeing far on the sea cannot descrie towns and coasts afarre off but only by help of some tower or hie place which their eie will sooner discerne thogh it be afarre off and so abraham sarah isaac and iaacob beeing long before the day of christs incarnation could not other waies see christ but afarre off by the eie of faith in the promises of the messias for this is the propertie of faith to make a thing absent to be present after a sort faith beeing the ground of things hoped for and the euidence of things which are not seene here then wee may learne a difference betweene the church in the olde testament and in the newe wee in the newe testament haue greater measure of knowledge more liuely discerning of the messias and a clearer light of vnderstanding in the mystery of our saluation by christ than the church had vnder the olde testament howsoeuer they excelled in faith yet in the knowledge and discerning of christ they were inferiour vnto vs and therfore the lord made this promise to the time of the gospel long before that the the earth shall be ful of the knowledg of the lord as the water that couer the sea and saint paul prooues this performed when he affirmeth of the church of the new testament corinthian but all wee as in a mirrour behold the glory of the lord with open face and christ ioh they shall be all taught of god if this bee true that knowledge should so abound in the time of the gospell then all ignorant persons of this latter age of the world must knowe that they haue much to answer for at the day of iudgment for god in the new testament hath made his church to abound in knowledge so that their ignorance for which they thinke god will hold them excused shall be a bill of inditement against them at the last day to their further condemnation because the light of the gospell is so clearely and plentifully reuealed in these dayes that whereas the most excellent patriarchs of all could then but see christ afarre off the most simple may now see him neere vnto them again where is more knowledge there should be more obedience therefore it concerneth all those that professe themselues to be christians amp submit themselues to heare and learne the word of god taught vnto them not content themselues with bare knowledge though it be neuer so much but withall to bring forth the fruites of obedience in their liues amp couersations for though abraham isaac and iacob in regard of faith did goe farre before vs yet seeing we haue more knowledge then they had in the messias we must labour to becom like vnto them in the obedience of our liues their faith was stronger then ours but our obedience should be greater then theirs because wee haue more cause to belieue then they s paul saith we all behold as in a mirror the glory of the lord with open face and the end thereof is this that we may be transformed into the same image from glory to glory as by the spirit of the lord so that the more knowledge wee haue the more sanctification wee ought to haue and the more hatred of sinne amp more obedience to god commaundements but the more is the pitie the case goeth farre otherwise with the world for euen many among vs that are no students by profession haue great and commendable knowledge in religion but where is the fruite hereof in holy obedience to the lawes of god god by calling hath made vs a pleasant vine but the sower grapes of sinne are our ordinarie fruite they be the grapes of gall as moses saith for atheisme blasphemie contempt of god word and worship with open profaning of god sabaoth doe euery where abound to omit the hainous crimes against the second table as oppression adultery and bloud touching bloud for all which wee may iustly feare that the lord will either remoue his candlesticke from vs and so of a church and people of god make vs no church or else sweepe vs away by some fearefull iudgement as with the besome of destruction because we withhold the truth in vnrighteousnesse rom for better it were not to haue knowen the way of righteousnesse then to turne from the holy commaundement giuen vnto vs let vs therefore ioyne with our knowledge obedience that so wee may shew forth our faith in doing the duties of pietie vnto god and of brotherly loue and christianity vnto our brother thus much of the first fruit of their faith the second fruite of their faith is noted in these words and beleeued them where by beleeuing wee must vnderstand not so much the act of faith for that was noted before as the growth and encrease of their faith for the word imports a confirmation of their hearts and a resolution in assurance of the promises made vnto them which is not vnusuall in scripture for paul prayeth for the churches who had true knowledge faith and loue that they might encrease and abound therein more and more ephesians philippians colossians heere then wee may obserue in the example of these patriarches that it is the duty and property of euery true beleeuer to goe forward and encrease in faith till hee come to a full perswasion and assurance in god promises all the giftes of god and therefore faith are the lord talents and euery true beleeuer is the lord servant called to occupie therewith now god hauing put his talent into any mans hand doth require the encrease thereof as the parable shewes luke and this paul teacheth for praying for the ephesians that they may goe on and be strengthened by the spirit in the inner man ephesians he signifieth that hee that doth truly beleeue in christ must goe on from grace to grace till hee be a tall man in christ as a childe groweth from yeare to yeare till hee come to bee a strong man the nature of faith is like vnto fire which will not goe out so long as wood or other fewell is put vnto it but will take holde thereof and growe vnto a greater flame and so will faith growe vp to a full perswasion in all those that conscionablie apply themselues to the worde and prayer but goes the case thus with vs in the matter of faith nay verily generally it is farre otherwise for many among vs haue no regard of faith at all but thinke they may liue as they lust their good meaning will serue the turne others and those not a fewe are so farre from going forward in faith that they are euery day worse and worse and still goe backward more and more a third sort wee haue that will heare the word and receiue the sacraments but yet their growth in grace is verie slender they stand at a stay and profit little now howsoeuer it may be thought but a small fault not to profit in religion yet vndoubtedly it is a fearefull iudgement of god when the hearers of the word in any congregation are daily taught and doe not profit thereby and therefore the holy ghost noteth those woman to be laden with sinne which are euer learning and yet neuer are able to come to the knowledge of the truth timoth if a childe lately borne like not well nor growe when it hath good keeping the common saying is that it is a changeling so if a man heare the word of god and doe not encrease in knowledge faith and obedience wee may most truly say of him that hee is a spirituall changeling and therefore to auoide this fearefull iudgement of god we must first labour for faith amp hauing faith encrease therein and in other graces of god till we come to be strong man in christ it is here said that those patriarchs encreased in faith but it may be demaunded how and by what meanes they did attaine hereto answer in the booke of genesis we may finde three wayes whereby they were confirmed in the faith and did growe vp in grace the first meanes was from god himselfe for when he had made his couenant with abraham mercifully renuing the same during his life as occasion serued sundry times he stayed not there suffering it to die with abraham but when abraham was dead god renued his couenant with isaac and rebecka and with iacob also after them now the tongue of man cannot vtter what a wonderfull furtherance it was vnto their faith to haue the lord himselfe to renue his gracious promises vnto them the second meanes of encreasing their faith was their holy conuersing one with another for the manner of the patriarchs was to teach and instruct their children and to nurture them vp in the true worship and feare of god by which meanes they did not only implant god promises in the hearts of their children but were themselues confirmed in the same for hee that teacheth another from a feeling heart greatly strengtheneth his owne soule now god himselfe doth testifie this thing of abraham saying i knowe him that he will commaund his sonnes and his houshold after him that they keepe the way of the lord to doe righteousnesse and iudgement now looke what abraham herein did to isaac that no doubt did isaac vnto iacob the third meanes to encrease their faith was from each one to himself for they gaue themselues often times in their owne persons to muse amp meditate vpo the promises of god so it is said of isaac that he went out to pray or to meditate in the field towards euening and wee may perswade our selues it was concerning this and other promises of god and the accomplishment thereof and wee neede not to doubt but that abraham and iaacob did the like these are the means by which these godly patriarchs were strengthened in their faith all which must be marked of vs diligently and put in practice for the cause why we heare the word often and yet profit little by it is chiefly this because the meanes by which man should growe vp in faith are so slenderly vsed among vs for the first meanes which is on god behalfe to man is through his great and vnspeakable mercy plentifully affoorded in many parts of the land in the holy ministerie of the gospell wherin god gratious promises of mercy are opened and applied to mens hearts and his iudgements against sinne are sharpely denounced to driue man to lay holde on god mercy in christ but if wee regard the second meanes which is mutuall instruction of father to childe of master to servant and of one neighbour to another together with mutuall conference about that we are taught or else if wee regard the third meanes which is priuate meditation vpon god word and promises taught vnto vs which meditation is to a christian soule like the chewing of the cudde vnto a beast for as chewing the cudde turnes that which was eaten into true feeding so doth holy meditation make god word and promises spirituall refreshing by digesting them in the heart if i say wee take a viewe of these two latter wee shall finde them seldome vsed of very many or not at all blessed be god we neede not to doubt but there bee some who vse these meanes with care and reuerence but alas these some are very fewe and because this duty is so slackly performed hence it is that though the couenant of mercy in christ be oft repeated yet man reape little profit by it so that we must learne to follow this notable practice of these godly patriarchs and looke what meanes they vsed for the increase of their faith the same also must we vse and that diligently so shall we grow and increase and waxe strong in faith as they did the third fruit of their faith is this and receiued them thankefully the word in the originall signifieth to salute and that not onely by speach but any way else as by imbracing ampc and therefore in this place is not vnfitly translated and receiued them thankefully that is they tooke them kindly at god hands this is a notable fruit of faith whereby they are commended that seeing the promises of god afarre off did yet take them most kindly at god hands but here wee must consider how they tooke them kindly namely by doing things by an action of their heart by an action of their life the action of their heart was this that howsoeuer the promise was not accomplished in their daies yet they were woderfully glad therof for our sauiour christ said to the iewes your father abraha reioyced to see my day amp he saw it amp was glad it did abrahams heart good to see christ afarre off and so we may safely thinke of sarah isaac and iaacob that their hearts were also rauished with ioy to heare the wonderfull promise of god concerning the messias and to thinke of the most ioyful performance which they knew should follow in due time secondly they tooke this promise kindly by the practice of their life for when they came to any strange place as wee may often read in the story there they built vp altars amp offered sacrifice vnto god and called on his name all which they did to testifie their inward ioy amp thankful acceptance of god promises in christ and of the promised land thogh neither were accoplished in their daies now as touching our selues the same maine promises of god that were made to abraham isaac and iaacob hath the lord made and continued vnto vs nay we haue the same already accoplished amp we see the same verified more euidently and plainely than any of the patriarchs did which being true our duty is to take the same much more thankefully and kindly at god hands than they did or could doe because we haue more light and knowledge in the promises of god than euer the patriarchs had but wee haue iust cause to bewaile the daies and times wherein we liue for whereas we should take the promises of god most ioyfully and kindly the case is farre otherwise for generally it may be said of our nation and people that in regard of the mercies and promises of god wee are an vnkinde people and that this is true for the most part in all of vs if we will but a little examine the matter we shall find too apparant by many euidences for first let any of vs be brought to a place where we may behold some vaine enterlude or showe a man would not thinke how wonderfully we are rauished therewithall so as we could find in our hearts to spend whole daies in beholding them but let vs be brought to heare the gospel of christ his holy word preached and taught as it was vnto abraham isaac amp iaacob wherein they much reioyced and there we sit heauy and drowsie so as the word seems loathsome vnto vs amp one houre is so tedious as we hardly hold it out without sleeping and if it passe the houre a little o how impatiently our nature takes it all which shew plainly that we haue no such ioy to heare of christ and his mercifull promises as these godly patriarchs had so that we are both hard hearted amp vnkind amp altogether insensible of so great fauours of our god towards vs secondly consider mens behauiour in god worship it is euident that the greatest part of people worship god but in formall shew for fashions sake these godly patriarchs abraham ampc built altars in euery place where they came and offered sacrifice vnto god to signifie their kindnesse amp willing heart towards god for his promises but now man worship god formally not in way of thankefulnes but either because the law copels them to it or else because it is a custome and order which must be kept for proofe thereof take some one of the common sort amp aske him why he commeth into the congregation he will say he commeth to doe as other man doe but what they doe he knoweth not or what he himselfe ought to doe he cannot tel nor careth much to know others also come to worship god but aske them how they doe it they will say by saying ouer the ten commandements the lord praier and the beleefe but if the word be either preached or read they regard it not thinking that all god worship stands in the repeating of those three things which sheweth that they worship god but for fashion sake and with little more than a plaine lip labour another sort there are which come neere to god with their lips but their hearts are farre from him for though their body be present in the congregatio yet their hearts are wandring about their worldly businesse or the works of sinne so that we may truly say god is not worshipped with faith in the heart and therefore wee are an vnkinde people and quite degenerate from the faith of our fore fathers these holy patriarchs who receiued god promises so kindly and thankfully thirdly we haue the word of god daily preached and taught vnto vs but how many be there that make conscience of obeying the same in their liues and callings man doe come and heare and should learne but when they come home they doe s at contrary to that which is taught now there can be no greater vnthankfulnesse nor vnkindnesse towards god then this that man should heare and not obey for disobedience is as the sinne of witchcraft nay the lord himselfe saith that he that maketh no conscience of obedience in his life is in his actions of god worship no more acceptable vnto god then a murtherer is when he kills a man wherefore seeing obedience is so rare to be found among vs and disobedience aboundeth euery where it is a plaine argument that we take not the promises of god kindly nor thankfully at his hands for if we did we would at least endeauour our selues to doe what god commaunds in his law and desireth in his gospell and so be thankfull vnto god for his mercies shewing forth our thankfulnesse by our obedience so that it standeth vs in hand euery man to looke vnto himselfe for his owne part seeing god hath giuen vs his gospell the meanes of our saluation that therefore wee receiue and embrace the same least god doe either take the same from vs or vs from it for we may be sure that the one of these two will followe if we do daily heare and make no conscience to obey and thus much of the third fruite of the patriarchs faith the fourth fruite of their faith followeth and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrimes on the earth heerein we are to consider diverse points the text saith they confessed that is they professed openly what they were and what their religion was and that not onely amongst themselues but before the face of god enemy and heathen man gen abraham tolde the people of the land of canaan that he was a stranger and a forrainer among them and when iacob came before pharaoh hee confessed that both his dayes amp the dayes of his fathers were dayes of pilgrimage gen now affirming so openly that they were strangers in those country they intimated a plaine deniall and dislike of the religion and idolatry of those heathen country and proclaimed themselues to be of another religion so that this is true which here is said of them that they made confession and profession of their estate and their faith and that to the enemy of god hence we learne that we are not to be ashamed of that holy profession of christian religion to which wee are called our calling is to professe the gospell and religion of christ now to many it is a reproach amp ignominie but we must learn this special lesson by the example of these man that howsoeuer the world iudge of christ and his religion yet we hauing entred into this holy profession and being called hereunto must neuer be ashamed of it much lesse denie or forsake the same in the primitiue church it was a cotemptible thing both among the iewes amp grecians to be a christian to the one the gospell was a stumbling blocke to the other a laughing stocke corin and yet paul professed openly that hee was not ashamed of that holy gospell rom and so it ought to be with vs we professe christes religion and therefore wee must not be ashamed of it some there be that knowe but little amp yet haue a good minde to religion but when they see some do nothing else but make a mocke and a iest of religion they are thereby daunted and held back from the open profession and embracing of it but if we looke to be saued by faith as these man were we must learne by their example not to be ashamed of the profession of christianitie whereto wee are called but must followe this notable example of abraham and the patriarchs who were not ashamed nor afraid to testifie their profession among the heathen whensoeuer any occasion was offered for whosoeuer is ashamed of christ in this world christ will be ashamed of him at the day of iudgement be his father in the world to come luke to goe further these patriarchs professe two things that they were strangers that they were pilgrimes a stranger is one that hath his abode not in his owne but in a strange country though he trauaile not and a pilgrime is one that is going through a foreign country to his owne home abraham isaac amp iacob were strangers because they dwelt as strangers in tents not in their owne country where they were borne but in that strange country whither god had called them and they were pilgrimes because they were alwaies ready to goe thence whithersoeuer god would call them and in all places wheresoeuer they were still they waited on god and sought to him for the kingdome of heauen now this was not proper to these patriarchs but is also common to all christians that looke to be saued by the same faith for dauid long after them cofesseth vnto god psalm that he is a stranger and a pilgrime or soiourner with him as all his fathers were and euen we also must followe their faith in the practice of this profession dwelling here on the earth we must testifie amp professe our selues to be both strangers and pilgrimes but how will some say shall we be answerable to this profession answer for the practice hereof we must doe these things we must vse this world and the things therof as though we vsed them not corinthian the temporall blessings we here enioy wee must so vse as though they were not ours but as strangers doe onely for the present occasion but we must not set our hearts thereon and the rather to perswade vs heereunto let vs consider the practice of these godly patriarchs they had the promise of the land of canaan distinctly amp absolutely so as no man in the world hath more right to any thing that he possesseth then they had to this land yet when they came into it they enioyed it and all things therein as strangers and possessed nothing but did euen buy ground to bury their dead in and so must wee vse the things that wee haue in this world for our houses we must vse them as strangers doe an inne and for our goods we must vse them as pilgrimes doe other mens goods where they stay for a night we must so vse them alwaies as being ready and willing to leaue them the next morning or at any time when god shall call vs away secondly we must cast off all things in this world that may any whit hinder vs in our iourney to the kingdome of heauen like vnto good trauailers who will carie nothing with them in the way but that which may further them to their iourneyes end and if any thing hinder them in the way they will cast it from them and rather lose it then be hindred from their home but what is that which is burdensome vnto vs in this our iourney to heauen this s paul sheweth when he saith tim that certaine simple woman are laden with sinne behold sinne is that that ladeth v and the author to the hebrewes calleth sinne the thing that hangeth on so fast and presseth vs downe heb therefore if we will be good trauellers and pilgrimes towards the kingdome of heauen wee must take heed of all sinne for that will hold vs downe that we cannot goe one step forward but will draw vs backeward vnto hell for the way is straite that leadeth vnto life and the gate narrow and few there be that can enter into it math he that would come hither must come with an humble and pure heart for the gate will not suffer any that is laden with sinne to enter therein the prowd man whose heart is puffed vp with pride and the couetous man whose heart is enlarged with desire of gaine the ambitious man who i with childe with worldly pompe amp state and the luxurious and voluptuous man who fats himselfe with earthly and carnall pleasures all these are growen too big to enter into this straite gate but the meeke in spirit who lead an humble and innocent life these shall tread this path though it bee narrow and enter in at this doore though it be straite and therefore we must cast off euery sinne by the practice of true repentance and so make our selues fit pilgrimes for the way to heauen thirdly we must learne contentation of heart in euery estate of life which god shall send vpon vs we must bee contented as well in sickenesse as in health in pouerty as in plentie in trouble as in peace and in good report and ill report and in all estates of life and death a pilgrime in his way taketh all things patiently that befall him and if he be iniuried any way he puts it vp quietly without seeking reuenge or making complaint till hee come home where he knowes hee shall haue audience and redresse euen so must we behaue our selues in this our pilgrimage to heauen in hope of that redresse and rest we shall haue we must beare all things patiently that befall vs in this life which is the way and doing these three things we shal become good pilgrimes and strangers in this world here two questions offer themselues to be considered first if euery man both in profession and practice must shew himselfe to bee a pilgrime and stranger in this world whether then is it not a good estate of life for a man to contemne the world and all things in it and to betake himselfe to perpetuall beggerie and voluntary pouertie answer the world in scripture is taken diverse waies first for the corruptions and sinnes in the world and these must be contemned by all meanes possible yes that is the best religion which teacheth best how to contemne these and he the best man who most forsakes them in what calling soeuer he liues secondly for temporal blessings as money lands wealth sustenance and such like outward things as concerne the necessarie or conuenient maintenance of this naturall life and in this sense the world is not to bee contemned for in themselues these earthly things are the good gifts of god which no man can simply contemne without iniurie to god disposing hand and prouidence who hath ordained them for naturall life the papists esteeme it an angelical state of perfection approaching neere to the state of glory when a man forsaketh all and betakes himselfe to voluntarie pouertie as begging friers do but indeed it is a meere deuice of mans braine and hath no warrant in god word which decreeth thus that he that will not labour in some lawful calling shall not eate obiect but here they will say that our sauiour christ speaking to the young rich man bade him goe and sell all that he had and giue to the poore and hee should haue treasure in heauen mark answer that commandement was not ordinarie but speciall belonging to that yong man it was a commandement of triall giuen to him onely as this was to abraham when god said abraham kill thy son gen and the reason of that commandement was peculiar to him namely to shew him his corruption and to discouer his hypocrisie againe howsoeuer the yong man was commanded to sell all yet he is not commanded to giue all but onely thus sell all amp giue to the poore obiect againe they obiect that christ himselfe was a beggar and his disciples also and had nothing of their owne but went vp and downe the world as beggars and liued of that which others ministred vnto them answer this is a meere forgerie and cannot be proued out of the word of god the bagge which iudas carried doeth prooue the contrary for he was as it were the steward in christs family who looked to their prouision and to their contribution to the poore as may be seene ioh yes christs disciples though they left the present vse of their houses and places yet they gaue not ouer their title and possession in them for christ went to peters house where he healed his wiues mother math and after the time of christs passion peter and the other disciples returned to their ship againe and became fishers for a time for christ john after his resurrection appeared to them while they were fishing quest whether may a man lawfully seeke to bee rich seeing we must professe our selues to bee pilgrimes and strangers in this life ans riches are taken two waies for things sufficient for aboundance for the first by things sufficient i meane things necessarie and meete for a mans estate to maintaine him and his family and thus a man may seeke to be rich for so wee are taught to pray in the fourth petition giue vs this day our daily bread that is things meete and needfull for the day from whence i reason thus that which wee may lawfully aske at god hands wee may lawfully seeke for but we may lawfully aske of god all things necessary to this life therefore wee may lawfully vse the meanes to attaine vnto them and this agurs praier sheweth also giue me not pouertie nor riches feede mee with food conuenient for me where wee see it is requisite a man should labour for things necessary to this life now because mans corrupt nature is so gripple that hee would not bee contented with the whole world though it were all his therfore we must learne this rule of contentation for worldly things namely to followe the counsell and example of wise and godly man who are neither couetous nor riotous but rest contented with that which is sufficiet as for the wearing of apparel we haue no speciall rule nor precept in god word and therefore our direction must bee the example and fashion of the most graue and godly in that calling whereof wee are whose president must be our direction in all cases wherof we haue no precept nor rule in god word but if riches bee taken in the second sense for aboundance aboue that which is competent and sufficient then it is not lawful for a man to seeke to bee rich for proofe hereof we haue the plaine testimony of the word of god paul saith tim when we haue food and raiment wee must therewith be contented for they that will bee rich fall into tentation and snares and into many foolish and noysome lusts which drowne man in perdition and destruction where the apostle dooth not simply condemne a rich estate but rather the desire to be rich that is a desire to haue more than is necessarie for the maintaining of a mans estate yet this is the common sinne of the world man are so couetous that they wil not be contented with that which is enough but still toyle and moyle for more till they haue gotten so much vnder their hands as would honestly and sufficiently maintaine ten man of their estate and calling but all such are condemned by the testimony of the holy ghost in the place afore named quest what if god giue abundance to a man by lawful meanes what must such a man doe answer when god sendeth riches in aboundance to any man hee must thinke himselfe to be appointed of god as a steward ouer them for the good disposing of them to the glory of god and the good of his church alwaies remembring this rule of the prophet dauid psalm if riches increase set not thy heart on them he saith not if riches increase refuse the but set not thy heart on them and thus much of these questions now this practice of the patriarchs is as necessarie for vs in these dayes as euer it was for the cause why we profit little after much hearing of god word is this we haue not behaued our selues like pilgrimes and strangers in this world but the cares of the things of this life haue choaked it vp math that it could take no ground nor roote in our hearts when we haue heard the word wee remember it not because our hearts and the affections thereof are set on the pleasures and commodity of the worlde wee therefore must shake off this filthy sinne and learne to behaue our selues like pilgrimes and strangers not intangling our selues with the things of this life but vsing them as though we vsed them not so as they be no hinderance to the growth of god graces in vs in the former verse was set downe the constancie of abraham sarah isaac and iacob in the faith now in the and verses the holy ghost proceedeth to amplifie and inlarge the commendation of their perseuerance in the faith for the scope of all these verses is to proue that all these particularly were constant in the faith vnto the end the proofe is made by one substantiall reason the summe whereof is this abraham sarah isaac and iacob sought for their country which was heauen and therefore they were constant in the true faith but some may thinke that this reason is not substantiall for man may seeke for heauen that neuer had true sauing faith as balaam desired that his end might be like the end of the righteous numb wherewith no doubt he desired the state of the righteous after this life i answere that this desire of balaams was not grounded vpon any constant perswasion nor settled resolution but vpon some sodaine motion secondly though he desired to die the death of the righteous yet he would not liue the life of the righteous hee had no delight to walke in the way to come to that end which they walked in without which no man ordinarily can come to it yet further some will say many shall seeke as our sauiour christ saith to enter in at the straite gate of the kingdome of heauen and shall not be able luke therefore to seeke for heauen is no sufficient argument of true faith answer true indeede many shall seeke to come to heauen and shall not be able to enter because they seek when the dore of mercy is shut and when the day of grace is past for there is a time of grace wherein the lord will be found now if man seeke him not in this time though they seeke him neuer so long after yet they shall not finde him but the seeking of these patriarchs was a sound and constant seeking and so a notable fruite of their true faith for they sought a heauenly country they sought it in due time not for a brunt but through the whole course of their liues they went the right way denying themselues and their estate in this life as being strangers vpon earth and they were willing to forsake all things in this world to attaine heauen esteeming it as their true dwelling place and their eternall rest now more particularly the holy ghost diuideth this reason into two parts amp handleth the same seuerally he proueth that they sought a country in this verse and that this country which they sought was heauen it selfe verse for the first part that they sought a country is thus proued they which say they are pilgrimes and strangers they shew plainly that they seeke a country but abraham isaac and iacob saide of themselues that they were pilgrimes and strangers therefore they shew plainly that they seeke a country they which say they are pilgrimes and strangers they shew plainly that they seeke a country but abraham isaac and iacob saide of themselues that they were pilgrimes and strangers therefore they shew plainly that they seeke a country the first part of this reason is euident in it selfe for hee that saith hee is a pilgrime and a stranger in any place sheweth plainly that hee is forth his owne countrey and therefore seeketh one the second part of the reason is assumed from their confession in the end of the former verse and confessed that they were pilgrimes and strangers on the earth from whence the conclusion is laid downe in this verse that therefore these patriarchs sought a country in this reason obserue first that the author of this epistle had diligently read the history of abraham sarah isaac and iacob penned by moses in the booke of genesis and in reading had obserued that which they particularly confessed of themselues in many places of that booke namely that they were pilgrimes and strangers yes also hee gathered from their confession this most heauenly meditation that therefore they were not in their owne country but sought another these three thinges then the author of this epistle vsed about the holy scriptures reading meditation and obseruation whence we learne that all god ministers and those which prepare themselues to the worke of the ministerie are diligently to reade and study the holy scriptures and to meditate therein no doubt the author of this epistle was an apostle and had most notable giftes by vertue of his calling and yet hee bestowed paines in viewing the particular words of abraham isaac and iacob recorded by moses in the booke of genesis daniell also was an extraordinarie prophet yet as wee may reade daniel hee studied with admirable diligence the prophecies of ieremie and ezekiel and timothie though he were a disciple acts and well learned yet paul chargeth him to giue attendance to reading to exhortation and to doctrine timothie and ezekiel is commaunded to eate the role and to fill his belly with it ezekiel and saint john likewise is commaunded to eate vp the little booke reuelations which thing he did all which strongly inforce the former duty shewing that god servant in the ministerie must as it were eate vp god booke that in iudgement and vnderstanding he may digest as farre as is possible the deepe things of god and the hardest places of the scripture here must he lay his foundation and hither haue recourse fro all other writing whatsoeuer in any matter of doubt this direction is most necessary for the schooles of the prophets and for all god ministers and yet notwithstanding the contrary practice beareth sway in the world for in the popish vniuersities most of their diuines apply themselues to study the bookes of certaine schoole man and the expositors or commenters thereupon these are applied day and night though they be both many and large and full of needlesse quiddities and oftentimes they be also publikely expounded whereas in the meane time the bible lieth neglected or little regarded wherein wee may see the notable worke of the diuell and his malice toward the church of god for the schooles of the prophets are the fountaines of learning now when as sathan by this meanes doth steale away from them the study of the bible and in stead thereof foisteth in corrupt humane writings hereby hee poisons the fountaines to the danger of infecting the whole church and as this is common in the places of popery so likewise some fault is this way committed among vs that be protestant for many in their priuate studies take little paines in the booke of god but apply themselues wholly to the writings of me as counsels fathers schoole man and other expositors and in the handling of the scripture they glory more to proue a point of doctrine by multiplicitie of humane testimonies then by the written word but the truth is thus to doe is to preferre the handmaide before the mistris and as for the opening amp expounding of scripture by other writers it is no such point of deepe learning a man of ordinary capacity and diligence may easily deliuer what others haue done before him but to open the scripture soundly and purely as it ought to be is of another nature then these me take it and hereto the sound study of the text itselfe will proue the best helpe as they will confesse who haue tried most of all and though the best mens works be but base stuffe to the pure word of god yet the writings of holy me must not be contemned but must be read and regarded in their place for our furnishing and enabling to the study of the scriptures and for the helping of our knowledge and iudgement in the word of god they that hold or practice the contrary knowe not what helpes they be and what light they yeeld to many dark places of scripture but stil aboue and beyond before and after all the word of god must be eaten vp of vs and studied with all diligence secondly in that the author of this epistle noteth their particular sentence and by consequence gathereth this meditation out of it that they sought a country hereby all man are taught to exercise themselues in hearing and reading all the places of the bible euen the history of man therein and out of the words to gather godly meditations so paul saith to the colossians let the word of god dwel plentiously in you coloss the prophet dauid also noteth it for the property of a good man to meditate in the law of god day and night and the practice of the blessed virgine mary is registred as an example for vs to followe that she kept all the sayings of christ in her heart but pitty it is to see how reading in the word of god is laid aside for it is so little practiced that man now adaies will not be at charge to buy a bible for bookes of statutes man will not onely haue them in their houses but at their fingers ends but bible they haue none and if they haue it lieth on the deske or table and they reade it not and if sometime they reade yet they neuer meditate thereon as wee are taught in this place further whereas the holy ghost reasoneth thus vpon these examples abraham isaac and iacob were strangers and pilgrimes therefore they sought a country herein hee teacheth vs this speciall point to wit that a doctrine though it be not expressed in plaine words in the bible yet being gathered thence by right and iust consequence is no lesse to be beleeued and receiued then that which is plainly expressed and therefore they are farre to blame which mislike these tearmes in diuinitie person nature sacrament consubstantiall trinitie ampc because they are not expressed in the word but they may with good conscience and much profit be retained because though not literally yet in sense and meaning they are contained in the scripture and may by iust consequence be gathered thence and wee denie not transubstantion because the word is not in the scripture but because the matter is not there nor can by necessary consequence be deriued from it but rather the contrary againe many refuse these doctrines the proceeding of the holy ghost from the son and the baptizing of children because they are not expressed in the scripture but hence we answer that though they be not expresly set downe in so many wordes yet by iust consequence they may be soundly gathered out of scripture and therefore are true doctrines no lesse to be beleeued then that which is plainly expressed and thus much of the first part of the reason and if they had beene mindfull of that countrey whence they came they had leisure to haue returned but now they desire a better that is an heauenly wherefore god is not ashamed of them to be called their god for he hath prepared for them a citie and if they had beene mindfull of that countrey whence they came they had leisure to haue returned but now they desire a better that is an heauenly wherefore god is not ashamed of them to be called their god for he hath prepared for them a citie here the holy ghost proueth the second part of the former argument by reasons the first is contained in the verse and the beginning of the it is taken from the distinction of country and may be framed thus they either sought an earthly country or an heauely country but not an earthly therfore they sought an heauenly country the first part of this reason is cleare of it selfe the second part is in the verse from whence followeth the conclusion in the beginning of the verse to come to the first part in these words and if they had beene mindefull of the countrey ampc that is if they had regarded or thought vpon mesopotamia or caldea from whence they came and where they were borne with any desire to haue enioyed the profit or pleasure therof they had leisure enough to haue returned backe thither by reason of the length of their daies which they liued in the land whither god called them here obserue two points first that they are not mindefull of or as the word imports they remember not the countrey from whence they came but when god gaue them commandement to depart thence and not to returne to mesopotamia againe after this commandement giuen they came forth and did forget their owne countrey whence we learne that howsoeuer vsually forgetfulnesse be a vice yet some kinde of forgetfulnesse is a notable vertue namely to forget the things that displease god and which hee would not haue vs to thinke vpon psalm the church is commanded to forget her own people and her fathers house that is her owne will and desires shee must neuer thinke thereof nor of any other thing whereby god is displeased vnlesse it be with dislike this condemneth the practice of many aged persons in these daies who delight themselues among the yonger sort to tell of the bad practices of their youth in wantonnesse contentions and breaking god commandements but in so doing they sinne grieuously for a man must not remember his sinnes but with dislike and detestation being grieued with them and angry with himselfe for them or else to teach others how to auoide them and as this kinde of forgetfulnesse is a good vertue so there is also a vertuous and good remembrance namely to be mindefull of that which may please god as of god iudgements to be humbled thereby and of his mercies to bee thankefull vnto almightie god for them and of his commandements to become obedient to his will these things therefore we ought to imprint by diligence in our memories secondly here obserue god calleth them out of their owne country and biddeth them liue in the land of canaan as strangers and pilgrimes and so they doe abiding there without any purpose to returne nay they are not mindfull of their former home hence wee are taught to bee constant in that calling whereunto god hath called vs it is a fearefull sinne for a man to goe backe from that calling in which god hath placed him when the israelites abode not patiently and constantly with god in the wildernesse but desired to shake off the calling of god amp to returne to egypt there to sit by the flesh pots againe they had god hand vpon them grieuously as we may read at large psalm lots wife for looking backe when shee was commanded to the contrary was fearefully and strangely punished beeing turned into a pillar of salt gen and our sauiour christ saith luke no man that putteth his hand to the lord plough and looketh backe againe is apt to the kingdome of god as though he had said he that starteth from the plough is not fit for the field no more is he that shifteth from his calling fit for god seruice to apply this to our selues god hath called vs to professe christian religion whence wee are called protestant we therfore must professe the same constantly and hold it fast without wauering or doubting euen without beeing mindefull of that spirituall egypt of darkenes and superstition whence we are deliuered much more without turning to any other this beeing the true religion which is grounded on god word againe in this our calling of christianitie wee haue vowed vnto god for our selues to renounce the flesh the world and the deuill now this beeing our calling as wee haue promised and vndertaken it so wee must obey it in our liues fighting manfully euery day against the world the flesh and the diuell for if wee professe religion in word and doe not obey it in deed we make our selues vnfit for the kingdome of heauen but alas man are like to the swine that returneth to the puddle thogh he be washed neuer so cleane and to the dogge that returneth to his vomite for most man do but serue the flesh amp the world and the lusts thereof therein is their ioy and their hearts ease take away these things from them and take away their liues so farre are they from seeking the kingdome of heauen as these patriarchs did thus much for the first part of the reason now followeth the second part which is this but they sought not a place in earth and therefore the conclusion followeth that they desire a countrey which is heauen in these words but now they desire a better but some will say the patriarchs were dead many hundred yeares before this was written how then can they be now said to desire a countrey answer the author of this epistle here obserueth and followeth the manner of them that write history who speake of things past long agoe as though they were now present now it is said they desired a better countrey these patriarchs had laid before them two country the land of canaan and the kingdome of heauen and of these two they might choose whether they would to be their portion and inheritance vpon which they would bestow their hearts now they esteemed heauen though it was to come better than canaan though present and therefore made choice of heauen and longed for it where we learne that as we must be thankefull to god for all his blessings so among them all wee should choose the best this dauid doth for beeing put to choose whether hee had rather liue in safe guard and in solace with the wicked and vngodly than in base estate and in great danger neere to god sanctuarie he saith psalm hee had rather bee a doore keeper in the house of his god than to dwell in the tabernacles of wickednesse and salomon is highly comended by the holy ghost king for choosing a wise and vnderstanding heart before riches and honour moses also as we shal see afterward had his choyce whether he wold liue gloriously amp at ease in pharohs court or with the church of god in aduersitie now moses hauing the gift of discerning refused to bee called the son of pharaohs daughter and chose rather to suffer aduersitie with the people of god than to enioy the pleasures of sinne for a season which holy examples doe all teach vs that when god setteth before vs diverse sorts of his blessings wee in spirituall wisdome must make choyce of the best on the contrary esau had this choyce set before him his brothers red broth and his birth right but he chose the worse amp therefore in the new testament the holy ghost noteth him with this marke to be profane esau for his labour and the gaderens also are branded with a note of infamie to all ages for choosing their hogs before christ and his saluation and the like choyce is set before vs euery day for god of his mercy in y e preaching of the word for his part doth set forth vnto vs christ iesus crucified and in him remission of sinnes and saluation now on the other side commeth the diuell and setteth before vs all sorts of vaine pleasures and delights shewing to euery man those sinnes to which he is giuen and with them all the profit or pleasures that vsually accompany such sinnes now most man hauing this choyce set before them doe leaue the true and substantiall blessings of god and come to sathans painted pageants and there make choyce of sin with those base companions that doe attend her this is too apparant to be denied for howsoeuer the word of god be preached vnto vs and we doe heare the same yet wee preferre the vanities and pleasures of the sinnefull world before christ crucified making no account of him nor of our owne saluation by him in comparison of the present profit and pleasures of sinne but wee must pray to god to giue vs spirituall wisedome and the gift of discerning that now when god sets before vs thinges so farre differing we may haue grace to discerne betweene them and withall to preferre and make choise of the best and to refuse the worst but as for them that are so mad in their choise that they now preferre sinne before the blessings of god in christ they shal see the day when they would wish themselues to be dogges toades or serpents rather then man and woman and yet though they would be glad of that exchange of state they shall neuer compasse it but shall remaine woefull man and woman for euermore because that once they made so profane a choise when the path of life was set before them they chose the way of death rather then of life and therefore when they would desire death they shall not haue it but shall liue a life more bitter for euer then any death in the greatest pangs thus wee see in generall their choise was of the better particularly the text addeth that is an heauenly in which words is laid downe the last and chiefe point in this reason to wit that the patriarchs desired a better country then the land of canaan and that was an heauenly country euen heauen it selfe the proofe whereof is principally intended in this place now whereas the patriarchs being our fore fathers in faith and patternes whom we must followe did desire heauen by their example euery one of vs is taught the same duty to aime at another and a better country then that in which we liue euen at the kingdome of heauen and not to thinke that this world is the country we are borne for this better country we must all seeke for whatsoeuer we be high and lowe young and olde learned and vnlearned if we will followe these godly patriarchs and this wee must doe not at death onely seeking this world all our life long for that is to despise heauen but euen in the time of our youth amp strength of our daies must we set our hearts on heauen endeauouring so to vse this world and the things thereof that when we die we may come to heauen that blessed country which we desired and sought for in our liues and to perswade vs hereunto consider the reasons following first worldly wisdome teacheth this if a man dwell on his owne land and in his owne house he is carelesse but if in another mans house whereof hee hath no lease but contrariwise is certaine to be put out hee knoweth not when this man wil in time prouide himselfe of another that so he may remooue into it and not be destitute and if it be within his power he will prouide a better that so he may not remooue for the worse beholde while wee liue in this world our body are tents and tabernacles wherein our soules doe dwell for a time and besides this time is vncertaine for there is no man that can say certainly he shall liue to the next houre therefore we must euery one of vs prouide for himselfe a dwelling place in heauen where we may abide for euer in all blessednesse again consider the state of all sorts of man in the world for sinne atheisme and profanenesse abound euery where the blaspheming of god holy name and the breaking of his sabbath besides daily sinnes against the second table now all these crie continually for vengeance and for god iudgements to be inflicted vpon vs and we know not how god will deale with vs for owne sinnes whether he will take from vs our goods and good name our health friends or life it selfe and therefore it standeth vs in hand to prouide for our selues a resting place wherein we may abide for euer after this fraile life full of misery is ended thirdly if we shall not doe this marke what followeth this and no other is our estate by nature wee are the children of wrath and of the deuill and by our manifolde sinnes we haue made our ease farre worse now what is due vnto vs for this corruption and for these transgressions surely not heauen but another place euen the contrary the place of eternall woe and destruction the bottomlesse pit of hell now if this be our due by nature then let not sinne nor sathan deceiue vs perswading vs that wee may come to heauen and still continue in the state of our corrupt nature but let vs labour by all meanes to eschew this place which is due vnto vs by nature that thorough the gift of faith in christ we may come to the heauely citie which these godly patriarchs so seriously soght for but if we remaine in our sinnes and so die we are sure to goe to the place of destruction and there to remaine in woe and torments with the diuell and his angels for euermore so that it stands vs in hand to vse all good meanes to come to heauen or else our case will be the most miserable of all creatures for perdition and destruction will bee our portion world without ende this must awake and stirre vp our dead and drowsie hearts that are so besotted with sinne that though wee heare yet wee neither learne nor practice in worldly things we can take care and paines but if we will doe any thing for our owne euerlasting good let vs labour by all meanes to come to heauen for if wee misse of that citie it had beene good for vs we had neuer beene borne or that we had beene the vilest creatures in the world rather than man for when the vnreasonable creatures die there is an ende of all their miserie but if we die and be not prepared for that place our death will be vnto vs the beginning of all woe and miserie in these words is laid downe a second reason whereby is prooued that these patriarchs died in the faith seeking their country in heauen the reason is drawen from the testimony of god himselfe recorded by moses in the booke of exodus where god saith he is the god of their fathers the god of abraham isaac and iacob exodus the exposition wherefore that is that this might appeare and be euident that these patriarchs died in the faith and sought this country of heauen god was cotent to vouchsafe amp grant vnto them this fauour to be called their god was not ashamed to be or not to be ashamed of one properly belongs to man and it cannot be affirmed properly of god that hee is ashamed or blusheth as the word signifieth but the meaning is that god vouchsafed vnto them this fauour and shewed them this honour and dignity quest what was this honour and dignity which he shewed vnto them answer to be called their god by which is meant thus much that god accepted them in his mercy to be such with whom hee would make his couenant of saluation and not with them alone but with their seed after them secondly that he chose them to make the couenant in their names for all the rest thirdly he vouchsafed them a speciall and extraordinary fauour euen that himself would beare their names amp they should beare his making his glorious name renowmed to the worlds end by this title the god of abraham isaac amp iacob hereupon the reason is framed thus god would not be called in speciall manner the god of vnfaithfull man but rather would bestowe such a special fauour vpon beleeuers but that fauour did god vouchsafe to these three patriarchs therefore doubtlesse they liued and died in that holy faith in that it is said god was not ashamed to be called their god here first we learn that god doth not vouchsafe his mercie equally to all man but some man haue more prerogagatiue in his fauours and mercies then others kings make choise among all their subiects of some man whom they wil prefer to be of their counsel or guard amp to whom they will giue speciall countenance and dispence their fauours more liberally then to all euen so god among all abrabrahams kindred maketh choise of these three persons abraham isaac and iacob to bestowe on them such speciall honour as he vouchsafed not to any of their fore fathers afore them nor posterity after them no meruaile therfore though he bestowe not his speciall mercy vpon all seeing he dispenceth not his inferiour fauours vnto all alike and yet for all this he is no accepter of persons for hee onely is properly said to be an accepter of persons that preferreth one before another in regard of some quality in the person but god vouchsafed this honour vnto these three only of meere mercy and good will and not for any thing he respected in them this confuteth the conceite and errour of many man broached abroad in this age that god doth equally loue all man as they are man and hath chosen all man to saluation as they are man and hath reiected none for say they it standeth with equity and good reason that the creator should loue all his creatures equally and this opinion they would build vpon the generall promise made to abraham because that in him god said all the nation of the earth should be blessed gen but we must vnderstand that all is not alwaies taken generally but sometime indefinitely for many and so paul speaking of this couenant of grace in christ saith the lord made abraham a father of many nation rom where repeating the couenant recorded by moses he putteth many for all againe graunt that abraham were the father of all nation and that in him all the kindreds of the earth were blessed yet it followeth not that therefore god should loue all man equally amp alike for he may loue the faithfull of all nation amp yet not loue all man in all nation for in his bountifull mercy in christ he preferreth some before others and this answer seems the better because we may haue some reason to thinke that god will saue of euery nation some but no ground to imagine he wil saue all of any nation much lesse all of euery nation here we may see that god honoureth those his servant that honour him as hee saith to ely the priest sam which is a point to be marked diligently for this god is the glorious king of heauen and earth yet he abaseth himselfe amp is content to be named by his creature aduancing them by abasing himselfe to be called their god the god of abraham isaac and iacob where we may apparantly see rather then god wil not haue them honoured that honour him he wil abase himself that they therby may be honored hence we may learn many things first that all that professe religion truly must inure themselues to go through good report and ill report and in all estates to be content for god honours sake as paul saith i haue learned in whatsoeuer state i am therewith to be content i can be abased and i can abound euery where in all things i am instructed both to be full and to be hungry to abound amp to haue want thus spake that holy man of god amp so must we all endeauour to say amp accordingly to practice and the reason is good because if a man honor god howsoeuer he be contemned or not regarded in the world yet god wil honour him amp esteeme highly of him that will proue the way to all true honour as it hath done euen in this world to all that tried it secondly hence we learne which is the true way to get sound honor amongst man namely to honor god good estimation in the world is not to be contemned for the lord comandeth all inferiours to honour their superiours wherby he also bindeth euery ma to preserue his own dignity now god honoureth them that honor him therfore the surest way to get true honour among man is this let a man first lay his foundation well amp begin with god amp set all the affections of his heart amp thoughts on this to honor god quest how may a man honor god answer by forsaking the rebellious waies of sin amp vngodlines amp walking in the way of righteousnesse through the course of his life this doth god take to be an honour vnto his high maiestie and when a man doth this vnfainedly then god will honour him euen among man so far forth as shal be for his good for god hath all mens hearts in his had amp wil make them to honour those that honour him so s paul saith if any man therefore purge himselfe from these he shall be a vessell vnto honour not onely in glory eternall after death but also in grace and fauour with god church this confuteth the opinion and condemneth the practice of many who would faine haue good report in the world and be spoken well of by all man but what course i pray you take they to come by this good name they doe not begin with god and lay their foundation by honouring him but they striue to please man whether it bee by doing well or ill they care not their onely care is to please all for that is their rule and resolution all must be pleased and because most man are ill they rather choose oftentimes to doe ill than they will not please the greater sort but he that beginneth to get honour by pleasing man beginneth at a wrong ende for by the testimony of the holy ghost in this place the way to get sound approbation before man is first to beginne with god and to honour him thirdly if god wil honour them that honour him then by the contrary consider what a miserable case many a man is in for those that dishonour god god will dishonour them againe as wee may see at large and very plainely in the example of elie and his two sonnes for them that honour me saith the lord vnto him i wil honour and they that despise me shall be despised sam and in zachary wee may reade that the man that by blasphemie theft or periurie dishonoureth god the flying curse of the lord shall enter into his house and remaine in the middest thereof and consume it with the timber thereof and the stones thereof zach and because elie did more honour his children than god sam therefore the lord threateneth the destruction both of him and his familie and according as the lord had threatened so it came to passe for when the israelites fought with the philistims chap his two sonnes were slaine and hear the hearing of the newes fell downe and brake his necke now if this be so what shall we say of our owne nation and people amongst whom it is as comon to dishonour god as euer it was amongst the papists or pagan partly by light vsing of his holy titles and taking his name in vaine and partly by swearing and open blasphemie and sometime euen by abhominable periurie nay it is many mens rule that they may sweare dissemble lie amp forsweare for aduantage these sinnes are some of them rise in all sorts of people and hardly shall you talke with a man that doth not by vaine othes dishonor god yes it is so common that children so soone as they can crawle or lispe out a word the first thing they can speake is to curse or sweare and take god name in vaine whereby god is dishonoured euery way so as it is a wonder that the earth doth not open amp swallow vp many man quicke for their swearing and blasphemy and wheras god iudgements are often grieuously inflicted vpon vs in many places of the land we may perswade our selues that among other sinnes it is for our blasphemie and taking god name in vaine and if it be not speedily redressed it is to be feared lest god will raine downe his iudgements vpon vs and in his wrath sweepe vs all away and take away the father with the childe the good with the bad because there is no reformation of so vile and yet so needlesse a sinne obserue here further that abraham isaac and iaacob could all of them say god is my god now that which these worthy patriarchs could say of themselues we must euery one of vs in our own persons labour for for their exaple is amp must be a rule for vs to follow we therfore must labour for this assurace by god grace to say as these holy patriarchs did say the true iehoua is my god and of this i am resolued amp vndoubtedly assured in mine own coscience qu how shal we be able to say vnfainedly god is my god ans by becomming his servant and people in deed amp truth for to him who is one of god people god is alwaies his god but how shall wee become god true servant answer by setting our hearts vpon the true god and giuing them wholly vnto him and to his seruice and restraining our selues from all occasions of sinne because sinne displeaseth him quest but how shall a man set his heart wholly on god answer this hee doth when he loueth him aboue all and feareth him aboue all and aboue all things is zealous for god glorie when hee hath full confidence in god word and promises and is more grieued for displeasing god than for all things in the world besides or more plainly thus then a man doth set his heart on god when his heart is so affected that when god commands he is alwaies ready to obey so the lord saith hos i will say to them that were not my people thou article my people and they shall say thou article my god and in the psalmes the lord saith psalm seeke ye my face then the holy mans heart as an eccho giueth answer i seeke thy face o god and such a one is the heart of him that is indeede the servant and childe of god amp one of god people these words are a reason of the former proouing that god was not ashamed to be called their god because hee prepared a citie for them and indeede this shewes euidently that god was greatly delighted with them rather than ashamed of them for had he beene ashamed of them hee would haue shut them out of his presence herein therefore he declared his loue and fauour that by preparing this citie he procured that they should liue in his sight for euermore hence wee learne that hee which hath god for his god hath all things with him according to the common prouerb haue god amp haue all and on the contrary lacke god and lacke all and therfore dauid saith psalm blessed are the people whose god is the lord other things which here might be added haue bin handled before by faith abraham offered vp isaac when hee was tempted and hee that had receiued the promises offered his onely begotten son to whom it was said in isaac shall thy seede be called for he considered that god was able to raise him vp euen from the dead from whence he receiued him also after a sort in the former verses wee heard the faith of abraham isaac and iaacob commended iointly together now the holy ghost returneth to the comendation of their faith seuerally and first he beginnes with abrahams faith wherof he had formerly propounded two works or actions his going out of his own countrey his abode in a strange land now here followeth the third which is the most notable worke of all wherin his faith shines most gloriously and his example herein is vnmatchable the particular points herein are these the worke of his faith is plainely laid down in his offer vp of isaac the same worke of faith is notably commended by three speciall arguments to wit by three great impediments that might haue hindred this worke of faith as we shall see in their place v by his victory ouer these impediments v by the issue of this temptation and his worke of faith therein in the end of the verse for the first the fact of abrahams faith here commeded is this that he offered vp isaac his son it may first of all be demanded how abraham could offer vp his son by faith considering it is against the law of nature amp the law of god for a man to kill his own son which abraham must doe if he did offer him vp in sacrifice vnto god for answer hereunto we need goe no further than the story gen where we may see hee had a ground for his faith for though the generall commandement be thou shalt not kill yet he had a speciall commandement abraham kill thy son amp by vertue of that he did it amp did it in amp by faith but if that be so then therupon riseth another amp a greater doubt namely how can these commandements stand together one being contrary to the other ans here a special point is to be obserued namely that whensoeuer two comandements are so ioyned that a man cannot practice both but doing the one the other is broken then one of the must giue place to the other for howsoeuer all god commandements binde the conscience yet some binde it more some lesse because some are greater and some less than others whence this rule may be set down that when comm of god crosse one another so as a man obeying one breakes another then a man must preferre the greater as for example this is god comm honour god commanded in the first table again the comm saith honor parents amp magistrates now if parents or magistrates comand any thing the doing wherof would dishonor god being contrary to the first table then the comm giueth place vnto the first and a man must rather disobey magistrates and parents than dishonour god for the maine duties of the first table take place before the maine duties of the second and therfore christ saith if any man come to me and hate not his father and mother wife and children brother and sisters yes and his owne life also he cannot be my disciple meaning that if father or mother wife or childre would drawe vs fro god we must hate them rather then disobey god againe a commandement ceremoniall and a commandement of loue and mercy concurre together and it so falleth out that they should be both kept and cannot in this case therefore the ceremoniall law of the first table must giue place to the law of charitie and loue in the second table because the ceremonies are the inferiour duties of the first but charity and mercy the principal duties of the second table for example the lord inioyneth vs in the fourth comandement to rest on the sabaoth day now it falls out that my neighbours house is on fire vpo the sabaoth day whether then may i labour with my neighbour that day to saue his house answer i may for the strict obseruation of rest on the sabaoth day is a ceremonie but the quenching of fire in my neighbours house is a work of mercy and a maine duty of the second table and therfore must take place before a ceremonial duty of the table thirdly god hath giuen vs ten commandements containing all ordinary duties both of piety and of mercy yet if god giue vs a particular and speciall commaundement contrary to any of the ten that must stand and the ordinarie commaundements must giue place and yeeld vnto it as for example the second commaundement forbiddeth any man to make any grauen image yet moses by a speciall comandement made a brasen serpent in the wildernesse to be a figure of christ so the sixt comandement thou shalt not kill is an ordinary comandement and bindeth the conscience of euery man to obay the same yet god comes with a special comandement to abraham amp saith abraham kill thy son amp therefore the ordinary commandement of the table giueth place for y e time and so goe all y e comadements thou shalt do thus amp thus vnlesse god comand otherwise for god is an absolute lord and so aboue his owne lawes hee is not bound vnto them but may dispence with them and with vs for the keeping of them at his will and pleasure and thus was abraham warranted to sacrifice his son namely by vertue of a speciall and personall commaundement to himselfe alone but if abraham had not had this particular commaundement the sacrificing of isaac had beene unlawful and abhominable for the killing of a man is a hainous sinne much more is the killing of a mans owne son without a speciall commaundement for that is against nature and therefore the lord by ieremie doth seuerely condemne the iewes for burning their sonnes and daughters in sacrifice ier without any warrant from him though it may be they would pretend their imitation of abraham in the sacrificing of isaac yes and to shew his detestation of that fact he changeth the name of the place calling it the valley of slaughter verse and in the new testament it is vsed to signifie hell math and because this sinne is so odious it is rather to be thought that iephte did not kill his daughter in sacrifice to the lord as some thinke hee did especially being a man commended for his faith by the holy ghost but hereof we shall speake when we come to his example verse thus we see abraham had ground for this fact to doe it by faith euen god speciall commaund but here it will be said that abraham did not offer vp his son indeede for though he had bound him and laid him on the altar yet when he lifted vp the knife to haue killed him the angell staid his hand and suffered him not gen how then can it be true which is here said that he offered him vp for the writer of a story must make true reports but it seems the writer hereof is deceiued in the very principall point affirming isaac was offered when in truth he was not answer god is the author and inditer of this storie and in god sight and estimation he was offered though not in the worlds and therefore it is so said in regard of god acceptance because abrahams purpose was to haue done it and if hee had not beene staide hee had done it where we note a point of speciall comfort to wit that god in his children and servant doth accept the will for the deede so s paul saith corinthian if there be a willing minde it is accepted according to that a man hath and not according to that he hath not speaking of their releeuing of the poore he telleth them that god regardeth not so much a mans worke as the heart wherewith hee doth the work and therefore the poore widowe in the gospell luke is saide by our sauiour christ to haue cast more into the treasurie though it were but two mites then many rich man that cast in great aboundance more in heart not in substance this serueth to stay the heart of many a man that is found bruised in conscience for seeing his weake obedience and the greatnesse of his sinnes past he begins to call his election into question now what must a man doe in this case answer surely he must goe on forward in obedience and endeauour himself to continue therein and then though he faile many times through infirmity yet for his endeauour god will accept of him and be pleased with the same this doctrine is very comfortable to a distressed conscience but yet it must not make any man bolde to sinne for many abuse this doctrine and say that though they liue in sinne yet god will accept of them for they loue god in their heart but they deceiue themselues for this mercifull dealing of god in accepting the will for the deede is onely towards those that endeauour themselues sincerely to leaue their sinnes to beleeue in god and to walke in obedience but such as flat themselues lying in their sinnes god will not be mercifull vnto them deut here further it may well be demaunded how abraham could take isaac and binde him and lay him on the altar to haue offred him for though the common opinion be that he was but yeares olde yet the more receiued opinion of the best writers is that isaac was or yeares olde how then could abraham being an olde man of more then yeares be able to binde isaac being a young and lusty man and lay him on the altar to kill him for though abraham had a commaundement to kill isaac yet wee finde not that god commaunded isaac to suffer himselfe to be killed now nature moues euery one to seeke to saue his owne life and to resist such as would kill vs how then was isaac brought to yeeld thus farre to his father for answere heereunto wee are to knowe that abraham was no ordinarie man but a prophet and that an excellent and extraordinary prophet so god himselfe testifieth of him to abimelech hee is a prophet and he shall pray for thee yes he was esteemed and reuerenced as a prophet amp an honourable man euen of the heathen the hittites tell him thou article a prince of god amongst vs genesis now being a man of so high place and so great regard euen in the world doubtlesse hee was of much more authoritie in his owne house it is therefore very likely that hee tells isaac his son that hee had a speciall commaundement from god to kill him in sacrifice now isaac being an holy man and well brought vp hearing this is contented to be sacrificed and obayes his father herein this i speake not as certaine but as most probable and it is the iudgment of best learned who haue had good experience in the scripture this circumstance well obserued serues greatly for the commendation of them both of abraham the father that had so religiouslie brought vp his onelie son that was most deere vnto him that hee would not resist the will of god reuealed vnto him though it cost him his life oh that parents would followe abraham in so doing to their children then would it goe well with the church of god againe isaacs behauiour is heere admirable that hee would not resist his weake and aged father but suffereth him to binde him and to lay him on the altar yeelding himselfe vnto death when his father tolde him my son god will haue it so this example must bee a patterne of obedience not onely for children towards their parents but for vs all towards god ministers when they shall tell vs what god would haue vs doe we must submit our selues and yielde though it turne to our bodily paine and griefe for isaac yeelds though it were to the losse of his life but alas who will follow isaac for let the minister speake against our carnall pleasure and unlawful gaine let him crosse our humour and affections then wee refuse to heare and will not obey nay if the minister of god as the lord priest come with the sacrificing knife of god word to the throat of our sin to kill the same in vs that so we may bee pure and acceptable sacrifices vnto god doe we not resist him and say in our hearts wee will none of this doctrine or if he like a prophet of god come and offer to binde our consciences with the cordes of obedience and to lay our affections on the altar of the law then we resist and are either too yong or too olde too rich or too learned or too great to be taught and bound to obedience but let vs know that if wee will bee true isaacs euen the sonnes of faith and obedience and the true heires of abrahams faith as wee would beare the world in hand then as he did submit himselfe to be bound of his father so must wee yield our selues to the ministers of god to bee bound by his word and suffer the same word to be in vs the two edged sword of the spirit to cut downe sinne and corruption in vs and to make vs newe creatures that so both in body and soule wee may become pure and acceptable sacrifices vnto our god thus much of the facte it selfe wherein abrahams faith is set forth now follow the arguments or reasons whereby the same worke of faith is commended vnto vs the first argument is taken from the great impediments which might hinder his faith and they are in number three first that he was brought to this worke not by ordinary command but by an extraordinary course in temptation beeing tempted secondly that he was to offer his own childe yes his onely begotten son thirdly that he who had receiued the promises must offer him and kill him in whom the promise was made for the first impediment in the ordinarie translation it is read thus when he was tried but that is not so fit beeing rather an exposition of the meaning than a translation of the word for the very word signifieth to be tempted and the meaning is when he was tried i would therefore rather read it thus when he was tempted or beeing tempted as the word signifies in the handling hereof first wee will intreat of the nature of this temptation and then come to the circumstances belonging to the same temptation as it is here vsed may be thus described it is an action of god whereby he prooueth and makes experience of the loyaltie and obedience of his servant first i say it is an action of god this is plaine by the testimony of moses in genesis gen where if we read the history we shall finde that god did prooue abraham obiect but against this it may be obiected that saint iames saith iames god tempteth no man and therefore no temptation is the action of god answer that place in iames is thus to bee vnderstood god tempteth no man that is god doth not stirre vp or mooue any mans heart to sinne yet further it will be said that temptation is an action of satan for so in the gospel wee may read mat that hee is called the tempter answer some temptations are the actions of god and some the actions of satan god tempteth and satan tempteth but there is great difference in their temptations first in the manner for satan tempteth a man to sinne against the will of god and to doe some euill god tempteth a man to doe something which shall be onely against his owne affections or his reason secondly god tempteth for the good of his servant but satan tempteth for the destruction both of their body and soules againe i say whereby he makes triall ampc here some will say god knowes euery mans heart and what is in them and what they will doe long before and therefore hee needeth not to make triall of any man answer god makes triall of his servant not because hee is ignorant of that which is in their heart for hee vnderstandeth their thoughts long before but because he will haue their obedience made knowen partly to themselues and partly to the world so that hee makes triall of his servant not for himselfe but for our sakes now further god tempteth man three waies first by iudgements and calamities in this world so the lord saith to the israelites deut thou shalt remember all the way which the lord thy god ledde thee this fortie years in the wildernesse for to humble thee for to prooue and to know what is in thy heart that iourney might haue beene gone in forty daies but god did lead them in it forty yeares to prooue and trie by this vnwoonted calamity whether they would obey him or not so likewise god suffered false prophets and dreamers of dreames to come among the people for this ende to prooue them and to know whether they loued the lord their god with all their heart and with all their soule deut now this first kinde of temptations by outward iudgements is most grieuous when the lord laieth his own hand vpon his servant so heauily as they shal thinke themselues to bee quite forsaken in this temptation was dauid as we may reade at large psalm the and psalm and iob being afflicted not onely outwardly in body but inwardly in minde crieth out that the arrowes of the almighty were in him iob and through the whole chapter hee bewaileth his grieuous estate by reason of this temptation secondly god tempteth his servant by withdrawing his graces from them and by forsaking them in part and this kinde of temptation is as grieuous as the former herewith was good king hezekias tempted for as wee may reade god left him to a sinne of vaine glory and the end was to try him and to proue all that was in his heart chronicle thirdly god tempteth his servant by giuing vnto them some strange and extraordinarie commaundement as in the gospell when the young man came to our sauiour christ and asked him what good thing hee might doe to haue eternall life math christ biddeth him goe and sell all that he had and giue to the poore this commaundement had this vse to be a commaundement of triall vnto the young man whereby god would proue what was in his heart that the same might be manifest both to himselfe amp vnto others and vnder this kinde we must comprehend this temptation of abraham for when god said abraham offer vp thy son in sacrifice it was not a commaundement requiring actuall obedience for god meant not that abraham should kill his son but onely of triall to see what he would doe and these are god temptations whereby he proueth his servant yet farther the temptations of god whereby he tempteth his children haue two ends they serue to disclose and make euident the graces of god that be hidden in the hearts of his servant so s iames saith my brother count it exceeding great ioy when ye fall into diverse tentations iames the reason followeth knowing that the triall of your faith bringeth forth patience verse where we see this end of temptation set down to manifest the gift of patience wrought in the heart and saint peter saith to the church of god that they were in heauinesse through manifolde tentations that the triall of their faith being much more precious then golde that perisheth though it be tried with fire might be found vnto their praise and honour and glory at the appearing of the lord iesu peter where temptations haue this vse to make manifest the soundnesse of mens faith in god as the fire doth proue the golde to be good and precious so in this place the temptation of abraham serueth for this end to make manifest his notable faith and obedience vnto god with a reuerend feare of his maiestie as the lord himselfe testifieth saying now i knowe that thou fearest god seeing for my sake thou hast not spared thine onely son genesis meaning this now i haue made thy faith and loue and feare of mee so manifest that all the worlde may see it and speake of it secondly god temptations serue to manifest hidden sinnes and corruptions partly to a mans owne selfe and partly to the world and for this end god tempted hezekias for being recouered of his sicknesse after that the king of ashur his great enemie was vanquished especially when the embassadours of the king of babell came to enquire of the wonders which were done in the land god left him that hee might see his sinnes and the corruptions of his nature as pride and vaine glory wherewith hee was puffed vp at the comming of the embassadours to him and thus hee who little thought that pride and vaine glory could haue taken such holde on him perceiuing how his heart was lift vp in him was doubtlesse much humbled at the sight of this his so great corruption for when the prophet came vnto him he submitted himselfe to the word of reproofe isay first wheras abraham the servant of god was tempted that is was prooued and tried by god himselfe here wee are taught that if we perswade our selues to be the seruats of god as abraham was then wee must looke to haue temptations at god owne hand for his example is a patterne for vs and therefore in him wee must see that which we must looke to haue for it could not be needfull for abraham but it may be also needfull to vs in regard wherof saint peter counteth it as a thing necessarie that man should fall into sundry temptations that the triall of their faith might be vnto their praise so that in this life we must looke for triall and the more glorious our faith is and the more like to our father abrahams the more trialls shall we vndergoe againe seeing we must be tried therefore euery one of vs must labour for soundnesse of grace in our hearts as of faith repentance hope and of the loue of god though they be but little in measure for we must come to triall amp it must appeare whether wee be hotte or colde now if we haue not soundnesse of grace in vs in the time of triall then looke as drosse consumeth in the fire when as golde commeth out more cleere so shall hypocrisie formalitie and all temporizing profession come to nothing in the middest of tentation when sound grace and a good conscience shall passe through and shine more pure and perfect after than before thirdly considering wee are to looke for trials and temptations from god therefore we must be carefull to remember and practice that counsell of christ to his disciples before his passion watch and pray that yee enter not into temptation math and because they were carelesse in practicing this dutie therefore they fell into temptation especially peter fell most grieuously by denying his master wee must perswade our selues that the same commandement is giuen to vs for god will prooue vs by temptations to make manifest the corruptions that bee in our hearts wee therefore considering our owne estate must pray for god assisting and strengthning grace that when temptations shal come we may be found sound and stedfast in the triall thus much of the nature of abrahams temptation now followe the circumstances to be considered therein and first of the time when abraham was tempted hereof we may reade genesis after these things saith moses god did proue abraham the wordes will admit a double reference but this i take to be most proper and fitte for that place to wit that after god had made most excellent promises vnto abraham and giuen him most wonderfull blessinges and priuiledges then hee tempted him hence we learne this notable lesson that those people in god church which receiue from god more graces then others must look for more tentations this we shal see to be true in christ iesus the head of the church for when hee was baptized and had receiued the holy ghost matthew in the forme of a doue and had this voyce of god the father pronounced vpon him that he was his well beloued son in whom hee was well pleased then presently followeth this that hee was led into the wildernesse to be tempted of the diuell matthew luke being full of the holy ghost as luke saith so likewise when god had testified of iob that hee was an vpright and iust man one that feared god and eschewed euill iob then satan tooke occasion thereby to tempt him as in all the whole course of that booke wee may plainely see wherein are set downe most wonderfull temptations and trialls wherby hee was prooued so iacob must wrestle with the angell genesis and by the power of god ouercome god himselfe this was a notable prerogatiue to preuaile with the lord but yet he must preuaile with his foile verse and at the same time and euer after drawe one of his legges after him euen to his dying day saint paul was rapt vp into the third heauen into paradise and heard words which cannot be spoken yes which are impossible for man to vtter yet least hee should be exalted out of measure through aboundance of reuelations there was giuen vnto him a pricke in the flesh the messenger of satan to buffet him corinthians verse god will honour him with reuelations but yet satan shall haue leaue to buffet and beate him as it were blacke and blew in all which wee may see that to whom god vouchsafeth a a greater measure of grace to them hee appointeth singular trialls and temptations aboue other man and the reason is first because god graces doe better appeare in temptations then out of them as golde is best tried in the fire and thereby proued most pure and perfect secondly temptations serue to abase the servant of god and to bring him downe in his owne conceite that hee be not proude of those thinges that are in him or puffed vp with conceite that there is more in him then indeede there is this wee sawe in paules example hee was buffeted of satan lest hee should be exalted with aboundance of reuelations wee may see a type heereof in worldly affaires the best shippe that floateth on the sea when it carieth in it most precious iewels is ballaced with grauell or sand to make it sinke into the water and so sayle more surely least floating too high it should be vnstable euen so dealeth the lord with his servant when hee hath giuen them a good measure of his graces then doth hee also lay temptations vpon them to humble them lest they should be puffed vp in themselues the second circumstance to bee considered in this temptation is the greatnesse thereof it was the greatest that euer was for aught we reade of that god should commaund him to kill his owne son for if god had tolde abraham that his son isaac must haue died it would haue beene verie grieuous and sorrowfull newes vnto him and yet more grieuous if hee had tolde him that hee should haue died a bloudy death but yet this was most grieuous of all that abraham himselfe with his owne hand should sacrifice his owne son nay his onely son and that which is more hee must kill his onely childe in whom the promise was made that in him should his seede be called this must needes be a great wound vnto his heart and yet to augment his griefe hee must not doe it presently nor where he would but goe three dayes iourney in the wildernesse during which time satan vndoubtedly wrought mightily vpon his naturall affections to disswade him from obedience which could not chuse but be farre more greeuous vnto his soule out of the greeuousnesse of this temptation wee may learne this lesson that god in tempting a man doth sometime proceede thus farre not onely to crosse his sinnes and corruptions but euen to bring him to nothing in regard of humane reason and naturall affections for this commaundement abraham kill thy son might haue made abraham if hee had consulted with flesh and bloud euen distracted in himselfe and without reason not knowing which way to turne himselfe and accordingly let all god children especially such as haue the greatest graces looke for such temptations as shall lay their humane reason s at vpon the ground and bring them to this point euen vtterly to denie themselues the third circumstance in this temptation is this what abraham did when hee was tempted the text telleth vs that by faith hee offered vp isaac being tempted abraham being thus tempted whether hee would obay god commaundement or not obayes god in offer vp his soone and yet layes holde vpon god promise made in him for wee must knowe that abraham had a promise of blessing in isaac and being now commanded to kill isaac he did not now cast off his hope and desperately thinke it could not be performed if this commandement were obeyed but by the great power of faith he both obeyes the commandement and yet still beleeues the promise for so saith the text by faith he offered vp isaac therefore in the very action of killing isaac hee beleeued the promise that isaac should liue and this was the excellency of abrahams faith for if god should with his owne voyce bidde a man kill his son it may be some would be found that would doe it but to doe it and still to beleeue a contrary promise made before betokeneth the vertue of an admirable faith in this circumstance we may learne a good instruction to wit in all temptations that befall vs still to hold fast the promises of god thogh in the diuels purpose they tend to the loosening of our holde and in all common reason we haue good cause to let them goe yet for all that wee must neuer let goe but still hold the promise fast and rather let goe all reason in the world than god promise and this is not onely true faith but euen the excellency of faith for example god promise is ioh god so loued the world that hee gaue his onely begotten son into the world that whosoeuer beleeued in him should not perish but haue euerlasting life now when we are in the extremitie of all temptations we must still hold fast this promise and venture our soules vpon the truth of it this was abrahams practice for in this temptation god meaning was to trie abraham and to see what he would doe now abraham hee holdes fast the promise and yet obeyes god though all the reason in the earth cannot tell how that promise and that commandement could stand together but this was abrahams faith though i know not nor reason knoweth not yet god knoweth and therefore seeing i haue his commandement i wil obey it and seeing i haue his word and promise i will beleeue that also and neuer forsake it and euen thus must we striue to doe in al temptations whatsoeuer yes euen in those that come from satan which are full of malice and all violence in our heart and conscience wee must still hold and beleeue the promise of god and this is euer the surest and safest way to get the victory ouer sata to hold that god promise shal be performed though wee knowe not how but rather see the contrary and though in humane reasoning it bee a note of ignorance and want of skill to sticke alwaies to the conclusion and question yet in spirituall temptations and trialls this is sound diuinitie alwaies to hold god promise and to sticke fast to that conclusion and not to follow satan in his arguments neither suffer him by any meanes to driue vs from it further in that this fact of offer vp isaac was onely abrahams triall we may obserue that it did not make him iust before god but onely serued to proue his faith and to declare him to be iust and therefore whereas saint iames saith iam that abraham was iustified through workes when he offered his son isaac vpon the altar his meaning is that abraham did manifest himselfe to bee iust before god by offer vp his son and not that by this fact abraham of a sinner was made iust or of a righteous man was made more iust for indeede good workes doe not make a man iust but onely doe prooue and declare him to bee iust thirdly god gaue abraham this commandement abraham kill thy son but yet he concealed from him what was his purpose and intent herein for god meant not that abraham should kill his son indeede but onely to trie what he would doe whether he would still beleeue and obey him or not where we see that god who is trueth it selfe reueales to abraham his will but not his whole will whence ariseth this question whether it be lawful for a man according to this example of god when he tels a thing to another to conceale his meaning in whole or in part for answer hereunto we must knowe there are two extremities both which must be auoided in this case that a man must alwaies expresse all that is in his minde that in some cases a man may speake one thing and thinke another speaking contrary to his meaning but this later is no way lawful and the other is not alwaies necessarie wee therefore must hold a meane betweene both to wit that in some cases a man may conceale his whole meaning saying nothing though they bee examined namely when the concealing thereof doeth directly stand with the glory of god and the good of his brother thus godly martyrs haue done for beeing examined before tyrants where and with whom they worshipped god they haue chosen rather to die than to disclose their brother and this concealing of their mindes was lawful because it touched immediately the glory of god and the good of his church secondly a man may conceale part of his minde but that must bee also with these two caueats first that it serue for god glory secondly that it bee for the good of god church thus did ionas conceale the condition of mercy from the niniuites when he preached destruction vnto them saying within fortie daies and niniuie shall be destroyed though it is euident by the euent that it was god will they should bee spared if they did repent but that condition god would haue concealed because it would not haue beene for the good of the niniuites to haue knowen it since the cocealing of it caused them more speedily and earnestly to repent but out of these cases a man being called to speake must declare the whole trueth or else hee sinnes greatly against god commandement forsaking the property of the godly psalm and thus much of the first impediment of abrahams faith the second impediment to abrahams faith is contained in these words offered his onely begotten son we knowe that the loue of parents descends to euery childe naturally but especially to the onely begotten vpon whom beeing but one all that is bestowed which when there are many is diuided among them and therefore in all reason this might greatly hinder abrahams obedience that god should command him to offer his son yes his only begotten son but yet by faith hee ouercommeth this temptation breakes through this impediment and offers vp his onely son where wee note that true faith will make a man ouercome his owne nature loue is the strongest affection in the heart especially from the father to the childe euen his onely childe and a man would thinke it impossible to ouercome this loue in the parent vnlesse it were by death there beeing no cause to the contrary in the childe but yet beholde abraham by faith subdued this speciall loue which he bare to his onely childe god himselfe testified of abraham that his loue to isaac was great gen and yet by faith hee ouercommeth this his loue this point is carefully to be marked as declaring the great power of true sauing faith for if faith can ouercome created and sanctified nature then vndoubtedly the power thereof will inable man to ouercome the corruptions of his nature and the temptations of the world for it is an harder thing to ouercome our nature which wee haue by creation than to subdue the corruption thereof which comes in by transgression and hence such excellent things are spoken of faith it is called the victorie that ouercommeth the world john and god is saide by faith to purifie the heart faith strengtheneth the heart acts and through faith we are kept by the power of god vnto saluation pet is this the power of faith to ouercome nature and the corruptions thereof then howsoeuer religion be receiued and faith professed generally among vs yet vndoubtedly there is little true faith in the world for euen among the professours thereof how many be there that subdue the sinnes of their liues and suppresse the workes of their wicked nature surely very few now where corruption beareth sway and sin raigneth there sound faith cannot be for if faith were sound in man it would purifie their hearts and cleanse the corruptions thereof and bring forth obedience in life secondly this power of true faith in mans heart must teach vs not to content our selues with a generall faith and knowledge in religion but to goe further and to get a sound faith that may purifie the heart at least in some true measure for sauing faith will cleanse a man in euery part of soule and body amp strengthen his soule in temptation quest here it may be asked how it can be truly saide that isaac was abrahams onely begotten son seeing ismaell was also his son and was borne before isaac as is euident gen i answere two wayes first that ismaell by god appointment was put out of abrahams house for it was the expresse commaundement of god to put forth the bond woman and her son gen and so was made no childe of abraham secondly ismaell was his childe indeede yet not by sarah but by agar a bond woman and so was as i may say base borne whereupon he is reputed for no son but isaac is the onely begotten lawfully which may be an item to beware of the bed defiled seeing such off spring is so debased with the lord now followeth the third impediment of abrahams faith which is also a notable circumstance whereby the same faith is commended and it is taken from the person of abraham in these wordes who had receiued the promises the meaning of the words who this must be referred to the person of abraham of whom the holy ghost here speaketh receiued the promises that is by faith for when god made his promises vnto abraham he did not onely heare them but which is the principall point of all hee beleeued them and applied the same effectually vnto his owne soule so much doth the word receiued import now it is saide that hee receiued not one promise but the promises plurally for these causes first because god hauing made one maine promise vnto him touching christ did repeate and renue the same diverse times secondly because god had made diverse particular promises vnto him as first that he would be his god and the god of his seed gen secondly that he would giue him a childe in his olde age gen thirdly that vnto him and his seed he would giue the land of canaan for euer gen fourthly that in isaac he would blesse all the nation of the earth genesis and because the receiuing of god promises in generall could seeme no great impediment to abrahams worke of faith therefore the holy ghost annexeth his receiuing of a particular promise in isaac in the verse to whom it was said in isaac shall thy seede be called which might seeme impossible to stand with the doing of this worke in sacrificing his son and therefore the consideration of it in abraham must needes bee a great impediment to him in this worke for he goes about to kill isaac in obedience to god commaund in whose life he beleeued to receiue the blessings promised of god here then obserue a most wonderfull impediment to abrahams faith which aboue all might haue hindred him from obeying god for how could hee choose but reason thus with himselfe god hath made vnto me many gracious promises and that which is more he hath saide that in my son isaac the same must he accomplished and in him all the nation of the earth must be blessed now then if i shall kill and sacrifice my son how shall these promises bee accomplished and reason in this case would say i see no way but that the promise is gone and all hope lost but what doth abraham in this case for all this hee doth sacrifice his son and that by faith still beleeuing and holding assuredly that though isaac were sacrificed and slain yet in him should all the nation of the earth be blessed here then we note this speciall point wherein the faith of abraham doth notably appeare that when abrahams case in respect of enioying the promise of god might seeme desperate and void of all hope and comfort then he beleeueth for when isaac was dead in all reason he could haue no hope of the accomplishing of god promises vnto him because they were made to him in isaac isaac was the man in whom all the nation of the earth should be blessed and yet when all hope is past in mans reason then good abraham set his heart to beleeue this practice of abraham must be a patterne for vs to obserue and followe all our liues long in the matter of our saluation if it fall out that wee shall doubt of our saluation and feele many thinges in vs that would carie vs to despaire when wee are in this case and feele no comfort then let vs call to minde abrahams practice who beleeues god promise when the foundation thereof is taken away euen so let vs doe at the same instant when the promise of god seemes to be frustrate and wee haue no hope of the accomplishment thereof then wee must cast our soules vpon it for we must not onely beleeue when wee feele comfort in our consciences concerning god mercies but euen then when god seemes to stande against vs and when wee feele in our soules the very gall of hell then i say wee must beleeue in paules daungerous voyage towards rome when hee was in the shippe with the mariners and centurion there arose a great tempest and neither sun nor starres appeared for many dayes so that as the text saith all hope that they should bee saued was taken away actes now what saith paul in this extremitie of danger now i exhort you to bee of good courage for there shall bee no losse of any mans life saue of the shippe onely verse and so perswaded them to take bread euen so when our case falles out to be this that either by reason of sinne and of the temptation of satan or else by reason of some outward calamities and troubles wee feele our soule as it were ouerwhelmed with sorrow and euen entring into destruction and can neither see as it were light of sun or starre then wee must set before vs god promises and labour to beleeue the same so dauid beeing in great affliction and grieuous temptation saith thus of himselfe psalm in the day of my trouble i sought the lord my sore ranne and ceased not in the night my soule refused comfort yet at the very same instant hee prayed when his spirit was full of anguish and though hee seemed as it were to despaire when hee said will the lord absent himselfe for euer and will he shew no more fauour is his mercy cleane gone doth his promise faile for euermore and hath god forgotten to be mercifull ampc yet he checkes himselfe and saith this is my death and my weakenesse euen so euery true member of god church in the extremitie of all temptations and in the time of desperation is bound to beleeue the promises of god and indeede that is the fittest time for faith to shew it selfe in for faith as wee haue before heard is the ground of things hoped for and the subsisting of things which are not seene now further it is said abraham receiued god promises that is hee applied them to his owne soule and conscience and beleeued them and made them his owne by faith this is a notable point and worthy the marking god made his promises to abraham now abraha he doth not onely heare and learne the promises but applies the to himselfe and by faith makes them his owne and thus ought wee to doe with all the gratious promises made in christ but the manner of our daies is farre otherwise for when the mercifull promises of god are laid downe vnto vs in the ministerie of the word wee are content to heare and it may be to learne and know the same but where is the man to bee found that will apply them to his own conscience and by faith make them his owne man commonly are like vnto way faring man or trauellers on the sea that passe by many goodly faire buildings rich townes and island which when they behold they admire and wonder at and so goe their way without making purchase of any of them and thus deale the most man with god mercifull promises in the ministery of the word god laies open vnto them his rich mercies and bountifull promises in christ and man approoue thereof and like them well whereupon many doe willingly apply themselues to know the same but for all this they wil not receiue them by faith and so apply them to their owne soules but we must take a better course and when we heare of the promises of god made vnto vs in christ wee must not content our selues with a bare knowledge of them but labour to beleeue them and apply them vnto our selues to our soules and consciences and so by faith make them our owne as it is said of abraham and in him of all the faithfull the blessing of abraham came on the gentiles thorough iesus christ that wee might receiue the promise of the spirit through faith gal further obserue the holy ghost setteth down that particular promise which god made to abraham in his son isaac to whom it was said in isaac shall thy seed be called gen rom in which places it is said that in isaac should his seede be called the meaning whereof is plaine and thus much in effect ismael shall not be thy son amp heire but isaac is the childe which shall be thy heire hee it is in whom i will accomplish the promises of life and saluation made to thee from the words thus explaned first wee must obserue pauls collection gathered from god dealing with those two persons romanes namely that god before all worlds hath chosen some man to saluation in his eternall counsell to manifest the glory of his grace and hath refused and reiected others leauing them vnto themselues to shew forth his iustice vpon them this doctrine is gathered out of this place after this manner such as is god practice and dealing towards man in time such was his eternall counsell and decree for as god before all time determined to deale with man so in time hee dealeth with them now god practice and dealing with isaac and ismaell is this ismaell is vouchsafed to bee made partaker of temporall blessings but yet he is cut off from the spirituall couenant of grace and isaac is the man that must receiue the couenant and by vertue thereof be made partaker of life euerlasting and so accordingly it is with others god hath decreed to chuse some man to saluation and these are admitted into the couenant others he hath decreed to reiect and they are cut off from the couenant and from life euerlasting these two persons isaac amp ismaell are two types of these two sorts of people who god doth elect and reiect isaac representeth those that are chosen to saluation who become the true members of god church and ismaell is a type of those that are reiected now in regard of this different dealing of god with mankinde chusing some and refusing others wee must all put in practice saint peters lesson with feare and trembling euen carefull aboue all giue all diligence to make our election sure peter for all be not elected to saluation but some are reiected all be not isaacs but some are ismaelites if all were elected and chosen to saluation then no man needed to care for it but seeing some are reiected and neuer vouchsafed to come within the couenant indeed therfore it standeth vs greatly in hand to take the good counsell of the apostle and to giue all diligence to make our election sure secondly whereas it is said not in ismael but in isaac shall thy seed be called wee may note the state of god church in this worlde in regard of the different sorts of man that liue therein for abrahams family was god church in those daies and therein were both isaac and ismael though both his children yet farre differing in estate before god ismael indeede was borne in the church and there brought vp taught and circumcised but yet he was without the couenant in god sight now isaac was not onely borne and brought vp in the church and circumcised but also receiued into the couenant and herein differed farre from ismael for hee is that son of abraham in whom god will continue the couenant of grace vnto life euerlasting to his posteritie and so it is with god church at this day in it there bee two sorts of man one which are baptized and brought vp in the church heare the word and receiue the sacraments but yet are not saued because they haue not the promise of the couenant effectually rooted in their hearts the other sort are they which beeing baptized in the church heare the word effectually and receiue the lord supper worthily to their saluation because god doth establish his couenant in their hearts this difference is plaine in scripture in the parables of the draw net math of the sower and of the tares as also by christs behauiour at the last iudgement math seuering the sheep from the goates both which liue together in the church and by saint paul who speaking of those which are borne and brought vp in the church saith that some are children of the flesh amp some children of the promise rom this beeing so that euery one which liues in the church is not of the church that is is not a true member of the church and the true childe of abraham it must make vs all carefull to vse all holy meanes whereby wee may be fully assured that the couenant of grace belongs vnto vs for it is not enough for vs to dwell in the church to heare the word and to receiue the sacraments for so did ismael and yet neuer was saued vnlesse therewithall wee haue the couenant of grace belonging vnto vs and the assurance thereof sealed in our consciences by god holy spirit againe consider who spake these words but in isaac shall thy seed be called wee shall finde in genesis it was god himselfe let it not saith god vnto abraham be grieuous in thy sight for the childe and for the bond woman in all that sarah shal say vnto thee heare her voice which was to cast out the bond woman and her son ismael for saith god in isaac shall thy seede be called here obserue a notable practice of abraham as a good direction how we ought to iudge of all those that liue in the church submitting themselues outwardly to the ministerie and regiment thereof abraham here hath two sonnes isaac and ismael he circumciseth them both and instructs them both for he taught all his houshold to knowe god and to feare and obey him gen hee iudgeth them both to be in one state in regard of god couenant though they were not but that difference is made by god abraham doth not on his own head and by his own will put ismael out of the church which was in his family but god bids him put him out and then he put him out and not before till such time he kept him in and held him to be within the couenant as well as isaac was euen so must we deale towards those that liue in the church secret iudgement must bee left to god and till god manifest the contrary in the iudgement of charity wee must holde them all elect this is the practice of saint paul in all his epistles writing to the corinths corinthian he calls them all sanctified and to the galatians gal hee calles them all elect speaking so in the iudgement of charitie although he knew that among them there were many profane and wicked man and though hee reprooue many great errors and hainous sinnes amongst them and thus much of the first argumet wherby abrahams faith is commended vnto vs namely the great impediments which might hinder the same now followeth the second argument or reason wherby his faith is commended to wit abrahams victory ouer these impediments or the meanes whereby he ouercame them and induced himselfe to obey god in these words verse for he considered or reasoned that god was able to raise him vp euen from the dead for he considered or reasoned that god was able to raise him vp euen from the dead here is the true cause that made abraham to offer his son and yet beleeue the promise that in him his seed should be called wee may perswade our selues that abraham had rather haue died himselfe if it might haue stood with the will of god than to haue sacrificed his son how then doth he induce himselfe to offer him vp ans by this which is here set downe he reasoned that god was able to raise him vp euen from the dead here are diverse points to be considered of vs first obserue the text saith not that abraham murmured or reasoned against god but reasoned with himselfe that god was able to raise vp his son againe and thereby induced himselfe to sacrifice his son vnto god hence wee learne that when god laies vpon vs any hard commandement wee must not plead the case with god or murmure against him but with all quietnesse and meekenesse obey this is a notable grace of god commended vnto vs by god himselfe in rest and quietnesse saith god isay shall be your strength in quietnesse and confidence shall yee bee saued many thinke it impossible to endure or doe some things which god imposeth on his children but our spirituall strength stands in these two in silence or rest and in quietnesse by these wee shall be enabled when nadab and abihu the sonnes of aaron offered strange fire before the lord which hee had not commaunded there went out a fire from the lord and deuoured them so they died before the lord now when aaron their father asked moses a cause hereof moses saide it was that which the lord spake he would be glorified in all that came neere him which when aaron heard the text saith he heide his peace and said not a word so dauid behaued himselfe in the case of distresse i helde my peace and saide nothing because thou lord diddest it and this is a speciall point for vs to learne and practice wee must not grudge or repine at god hard commaundements nor pleade the case with him but in all quietnesse and silence obay god in all that he saith vnto vs againe whereas it is said that abraham reasoned that god was able ampc here we learne that it is a necessary thing for a man that beleeues to haue good knowledge in god word that when a temptation comes against his faith by knowledge and reasoning out of god word hee may be able to put backe the same for all our reasoning in matters of faith must be grounded on the word so doth abraham in this place against this strong temptation reason out of god word to stay himselfe so that knowledge in the word of god is necessary to him that beleeues and therefore that doctrine of the church of rome is erronious and here condemned which saith that if a man become deuout amp beleeue as the church beleeueth though he knowe not what the church beleeueth yet this faith will saue him but this is a meere deuice of their owne and hath no ground in the word of god for as we see heere knowledge in the word is necessary for him that hath true sauing faith but what is abrahams argument whereby hee moues himselfe to obay god surely this hee reasoned that god was able to raise vp isaac from the dead one part of his reason he takes for graunted which heere hee conceales for this promise was made vnto him in isaac shall thy seede be called now this he takes for graunted that god will neuer change his promise from whence hee reasoneth thus god is able to raise vp isaac my son from the dead to life againe and therefore i will sacrifice my son according to his commaundement for this i knowe certainly that in isaac shall my seede be called seeing god hath promised that as well as he commaundeth this other in this example wee see a meanes set downe vnto vs to enduce vs to obey god in all hard and difficult cases imposed by god which is a point to be considered carefully of euery one of vs for say that any of vs shall be so touched in conscience for our sinnes that we euen despaire of our owne saluation what must we doe in this case wee must take abrahams course and dispute with our selues for our selues amp we must drawe our arguments from the promise of god and from the power of god we must ioyne the promise and power of god together as for example thus wee must say god hath made this promise this i haue heard and i doe beleeue it that god so loued the world that he gaue his onely begotten son that whosoeuer beleeued in him should not perish but haue euerlasting life this is god promise and it shall neuer be changed now therefore howsoeuer my case be heauie and desolate yet god is able to comfort me and to bring my soule out of hell and from this case of desperation therefore though he kill me i will trust in him and i will vse all holy meanes whereby i may ouercome this hard and grieuous temptation so if it shall please god to call vs to suffer any thing for the name of christ and his holy profession flesh and bloud we know is weake and nature will make this obiection that life is sweete what course therefore shall we take we must doe as abraham here doth vnto the certainty of god promise we must adioine his power and reason thus god hath made this promise that he will be with them that suffer any thing for his owne names sake and i knowe that hee is able to deliuer me and though he will not yet he can make me able to beare it therefore i will patiently suffer and abide whatsoeuer his holy hand shall lay vpon me thirdly is a man so troubled with some sinne that he cannot get out nor ouercome it then also let him set before him this fact of abraham and vnfainedly endeuour to doe heereafter for that which is past let him labour to beleeue this promise of god at what time soeuer a sinner doth repent him of his sinne hee will put all his wickednesse out of his remembrance and for the time to come being first resolued that god can inable him to leaue his sinnes let him striue by good meanes to leaue his sinne auoiding the occasions of it and praying against it and this will be as a cablerope to drawe him out of the pit of sinne this course wee must take and this doe in euery hard case that shall befall vs and thus much of the meanes whereby abraham induced himselfe to obey god the third and last reason whereby abrahams faith is commended vnto vs is the issue and euent thereof in these words from whence he receiued him also after a sort from whence that is from death after a sort or as it may be read in some shewe this is said because isaac in the thought and purpose of abraham was but a dead man for abraham was fully resolued with himselfe vpon god commaund to haue sacrificed him yes hee had gone so farre as to put the sacrificing knife vnto his sonnes throate and had slaine him indeede had not the angell of god staid his hand and therefore when the angell said lay not thy hand vpon the childe neither doe any thing to him euen then did abraham in some shew receiue isaac from death here we learne diverse points that whosoeuer shall rest on god prouidence and good pleasure euen in cases of extremitie when he shall be out of all hope with himselfe shall at the last haue a good issue this wee see to bee true by abrahams example in this place as wee said before he himselfe no doubt had rather haue died ten thousand times than to haue isaac slaine in whom the promise was made but yet beleeuing god promise that that should neuer change hee rests himselfe on god good pleasure and prouidence and goes on in obedience and so in the end receiued a blessed issue this is very cleerely set downe vnto vs in the history recorded by moses for when abraham had gone three daies iourney in the wildernesse and had built an altar then isaac said vnto abraham gen father here is the fire and the wood but where is the lambe for the burnt offer then abraham said my son god will prouide him a lambe for a burnt offer verse and thus yeelding himselfe to god good pleasure and prouidence he receiued his son againe as a dead childe restored to life so when we are in cases of extremitie when all goes against vs and when we can see no hope of any good issue or ende and all good meanes seeme to faile vs if wee can then cast our selues on god prouidence and rowle our selues vpon god we shall haue comfort in the ende and a good issue out of all wee doe all of vs in word acknowledge god prouidence but whe wee come to the pinch that wee fall into cases of extremitie then wee vse unlawful meanes and doe not with abraham cast our selues vpon god but seeke helpe of the diuell and wicked man but all such persons must looke for a cursed issue they therefore that feare the lord beeing put to any plunge or extremitie must cast themselues vpon god wholly and waite for his good time and pleasure and then will the issue be both ioyous and comfortable vnto their soules here some circumstances of this fact are to bee considered out of the larger story the first is this what did god vnto abraham at this time when he was about to kill his son answer god now gaue him a commandement to stay his hand and not to slay his son by vertue whereof abraham staies his hand god before commanded him to goe three daies iourney in the wildernesse and there to sacrifice his son hereupon abraham goes but now beeing come to the place hauing bound his son and is ready to cut his throat god bids him stay his hand and then also abraham obeyeth god and doeth not kill his son here we see abraham is at god commande and as wee say at his becke hee doeth not follow his owne will and pleasure but when god calles he is wonderfull pliable to doe god commaund whatsoeuer it bee one way or other this practice of abraham must bee a looking glasse for vs wherein to see what manner of persons wee ought to be looke what god commaunds vs to doe that wee must doe and what hee forbids vs that wee must not doe but this is a rare thing to bee found in these daies our practice generally is contrary for in our liues wee followe our owne humors and affections neuer regarding what god doth either will or nill but if wee will be abrahams children we must follow abrahams practice in this place for the sonnes of abraham will doe the workes of abraham john good servant will come and goe doe and vndo at their lord pleasure and forget themselues to obey their masters and so must it be with vs if we call god our good lord and master luke the second circumstance to bee considered is the time when abraham receiued his son from death to wit at the very same time when his knife was at his son throate and he himselfe ready to offer him vp for a sacrifice vnto the lord at that same instant god spake vnto him by his angell from heauen and said abraham stay thy hand gen this circumstance is worth the marking for god lets him alone three whole daies in great perplexity and abraham goes forward according to god commad euen to lay his knife to his sonnes throat here then we see what is the lord dealing with his servant hee lets them alone for a long season in temptation and pittifull distresse and at the length when it comes euen to the extremitie and when the knife is as it were at the throate then hee shewes himselfe and brings comfort vnto them the spouse in the canticles which is the church of god or a true christian soule whether you will for it is true both in the generall and particular cant shee seekes christ euery where in the streetes and open places but shee findes him not then shee goes to the watch man which are god ministers and there inquires after him whom her soule loued and they cannot tell her where shee might finde him so that now all hope of finding him might seeme to be past but when shee was a little from them then shee found him and christ comes to her when shee was most in feare not to haue found him at all the people of israel were many yeares in bondage in egypt and when the time came that moses was sent of god to fetch them thence and to be their guide and deliuerer when he had brought them out and carried them to the red sea then came pharaoh with a huge armie after them to destroy them exod before they had beene in great affliction and bondage but nowe they were quite past all hope of recouery for they had before them the redde sea and on each side of them great hilles and mountaines and behinde them the huge hoast of pharaoh and therefore they cried out vnto moses who then by god commaundement did diuide the redde sea and made it drie land and deliuered them through the middest of the redde sea but as for their enemy pharaoh and all his hoast the lord drowned them in the middest thereof so for our selues when god shall exercise any of vs in cases of extremitie wee must looke to bee so dealt withall at god hand hee will let vs alone for a time and neuer helpe vs till the last pinch and therefore we must waite for his good pleasure with patience for this he will doe to trie vs to the full and to make manifest the graces of god wrought in vs the third circumstance to be considered is this in what manner did abraham receiue his son from the dead this we may read of gen hee must take a ramme that was caught behinde him in a bush and offer him in stead of isaac so isaac is saued and the ramme is sacrificed and slaine now whereas abraham offered isaac in sacrifice to god and yet isaac liueth and the ramme is slaine in his stead hence some gather this vse and we may profitably consider of the same to wit that the sacrifices which wee offer vnto god now vnder the gospel must be liuing sacrifices for isaac he was offered in sacrifice to god amp yet he liued and died not but the ramme is slaine for him so must we offer our selues in sacrifice vnto god not dead in sinne but liuing vnto god in righteousnesse and true holinesse and thus shall we offer vp our selues liuing sacrifices vnto god when as we consecrate our selues vnto god seruice and obey him in our liues and callings and looke as vnder the law the burnt offerings were burnt all to smoake and ashes so must wee in our liues wholly and altogether giue our selues vnto god and renouncing our selues be nothing to the world but wholly dedicated to god neither must wee come vnto him in our sinnes for sinne makes our sacrifice dead lame halt and blinde which god doth abhorre but wee must bring our selues liuing sacrifices vnto god as paul saith ro i beg you brother by the mercies of god that you giue vp your body a liuing sacrifice holy amp acceptable vnto god which is your reasonable seruing of god hence also some gather that this sacrificing of isaac was a signe and type of christs sacrifice vpo the crosse for as isaac was sacrificed and liued so did christ though he died yet rose againe and now liueth for euer but because it hath no ground in this place though it be true which is said of both therefore i will not stand to vrge the same and thus much of this third reason whereby abrahams faith is commended with the circumstances thereof and consequently of all the examples of holy abrahams faith by faith isaac blessed iacob and esau concerning things to come in the three former verses the holy ghost hath particularly commended the faith of abraham now in this verse hee proceedes to set downe vnto vs the faith of isaac particularly also wherein we are to marke these foure points first a blessing wherwith isaac blessed iacob and esau secondly the cause of this blessing that is his faith thirdly the parties blessed which are iacob and esau fourthly the nature and matter of this blessing in the end of the verse concerning things to come of these in order first for the blessing that we may knowe the nature and quality of it wee must search out the kindes of blessings how many they be in god word wee finde three kindes of blessings whereby god blesseth man now god blesseth man by giuing vnto him gifts and benefits either temporall or spirituall and so he blessed all his creatures in the beginning but especially man the kinde of blessing is that whereby man blesseth god and this man doth by praising god and giuing thankes vnto him who is the author of all blessings so paul saith blessed be god euen the father of our lord iesus christ which hath blessed vs with all spirituall blessings in heauenly things in christ ephesian beginning his epistle with this kinde of blessing that is by praising god and so zachary after the birth of his son and the receiuing of his sight hee sings vnto god this song of praise blessed be the lord god of israell luke that is praise and thanksgiuing be vnto the lord ampc the third kinde of blessing is that whereby one man doth blesse another and vnder this kinde we must vnderstand isaacs blessings in this place now further this kinde of blessing whereby one man blesseth another is either priuate or publike a priuate blessing is that whereby one priuate man whatsoeuer he be in his place prayes to god for a blessing vpon another and this is common to all man for euery man may blesse another that is pray to god for a blessing vpon another but especially it belongeth to parents thus to blesse their children by praying to god for a blessing vpon them and therefore the commaundement goes thus honour thy fa thy father and thy mother that they may prolong thy dayes in the land which the lord thy god giueth thee exod now parents prolong their childrens dayes by blessing them that is by teaching and instructing them in religion and by praying vnto god for a blessing vpon them that hee would blesse them secondly there is a publike kinde of blessing which is done by the minister of god in the name of god and after this sort melchisedech blessed abraham as he returned from the slaughter of the kings heb and without all contradiction saith the author of this epistle the lesse is blessed of the greater verse further these publike kinde of blessings are of two sorts either ordinarie or extraordinarie an ordinarie kinde of publike blessing is that which is pronounced and vttered out of god word by an ordinary minister vpon the people example of this we haue in the ordinary priests in the olde testament whose duty was in the seruice of god to blesse the people before their departing and the forme of blessing which they should vse is prescribed vnto them by moses after this manner from the lord thus shall ye blesse the children of israell and say vnto them the lord blesse thee and keepe thee the lord make his face to shine vpon thee and be mercifull vnto thee the lord lift vp his countenance vpon thee and giue thee peace where wee see the manner of the priest was to blesse the people not in his owne name but in the name of god stretching out his hand ouer the heads of the people this kinde of blessing was then ordinarie and yet some way figuratiue signifying vnto them the blessings which christ iesus the mediatour god and man should not onely pronounce but euen giue vnto the church in the new testament which our sauiour accordingly performed to his disciples at his ascension for y e story saith when he was risen againe he led them to bethania where he ascended and lift vp his hands and blessed them and s paul declareth this blessing of christ more at large saying ephesian christ ascended on high amp led captiuity captiue and gaue gifts vnto man some to be apostles some prophets and some euangelists and some pastors and teachers for the gathering together of the saints for the worke of the ministerie and for the edification of the body of christ where we see that our sauiour christ did not onely pronounce a blessing vpon his church but was also the author thereof from god his father and as the priestes in the old testament had an ordinary kinde of blessing the people so the ministers of god in the newe testament they haue the same in substance for the ministers may blesse their people two waies first by praying vnto god for them secondly by pronouncing a blessing vpon them according to god holy word a forme of this blessing wee haue from the apostle saint paul who blessed the corinthians after this sort the grace of our lord iesus christ and the loue of god and the communion or fellowshippe of the holy ghost be with you all corinthians secondly an extraordinary kinde of blessing is when an extraordinary prophet or servant of god doth set downe and pronounce a blessing vnto any and foretelleth their estate from god thus did noe blesse his two sonnes shem and iaphet gen and pronounced a curse vpon wicked canaan this hee did not as an ordinary father but as an extraordinarie prophet not onely praying for a blessing vpon his two sonnes but also foretelling them what should be their condition or estate afterward so in this place whereas isaac blesseth iaacob and esau it is no priuate blessing but a publike and yet indeede not an ordinary publike blessing but extraordinary by telling vnto iaacob and esau before hand what should be their particular estates and conditions and what blessings they should haue from god both in this life and in the life to come for wee must not here conceiue of isaac as an ordinary father but as a holy patriarch and prophet of the lord and an extraordinarie man foreseeing amp foretelling by the spirit of prophecie the particular estate of his two sonnes and also what particular blessings they and their posteritie should receiue from god the meaning then of these words isaac blessed iaacob amp esau is this that isaac beeing a prophet an extraordinary man and a famous patriarch did by the spirit of prophecie foresee and set down and tel before hand what should be the particular estate of his two sonnes iaacob and esau and as hee did foretell it so likewise hee praied vnto god that the same might come to passe as it did afterward and thus much for the meaning nowe though this were an extraordinary kinde of blessing which isaac vsed yet from hence we may all of vs learne an ordinary duty for looke as isaac blessed his two sonnes so wee by his example must learne to abstaine from all wicked speeches as cursing and banning and exercise our tongues in blessing not making them the instruments of sinne to curse and reuile as many doe for vengeance is mine saith the lord hee must curse that hath absolute power and authoritie to inflict the same when hee will but wee are not absolute lord ouer any man or any creature and therefore we must remember saint peters lesson pet wee must not render euill for euill nor rebuke for rebuke but contrariwise blesse and he rendreth a reason knowing that wee are thereunto called to bee heires of blessing farre be it from vs therfore to open our mouthes to curse either man or any of god creatures and indeede vile and abhominable is the practice of many who exercise their tongues in cursing and banning not onely man but also other creatures of god but let such as feare god both learne and practice the contrary the second point to be considered is the cause of this blessing to wit isaacs faith by faith isaac blessed iaacob and esau here first wee are to consider how isaacs faith blessed iaacob and esau surely thus he did most notably gather together all the promises of god made to him and to his two children which were specially three first i will be thy god and the god of thy seed god had promised that he and his seed should possesse the promised land of canaan that his two children should be two mighty nation and that the elder should serue the younger now isaac doth not consider these blessings a part one from another but hath them all in memory and on them all receiuing them by a liuely faith he builds his blessings for by faith in these promises hee did certainly fore see what should be the future estate of his two sonnes and accordingly doth hee pronounce particular blessings vpon them both but it may be thought that isaac did not blesse his sonnes by faith for if we reade the history in genesis wee shall see that he blessed them by errour and was deceiued therein for hee was purposed to haue blessed esau onely with the speciall blessing when as he gaue the same to iacob vnwittingly how then could he doe this by faith for the answering of this we must consider two things first it is true indeede that isaac was blinded ouermuch with a fond affection toward esau and loued him otherwise then he ought and therfore was purposed to haue blessed esau with the speciall blessing this was a fault in isaac but yet it takes not away isaacs faith nor makes it to be no faith but it shewes that isaacs faith was weake and ioyned with som infirmity in forgetting god particular promises secondly howsoeuer at the first isaac erred in his purpose for the blessing of his children yet afterward hee corrects himself for it for as we may read in the history after he had indeede blessed iacob supposing it had beene esau when esau came for his blessing with his venison the text saith gen that isaac was stricken with a meruailous great feare and saide i haue blessed him and therefore he shallbe blessed correcting his fault in his former purpose yes and though esau sought it with teares yet hee could not moue isaac to repent himselfe of blessing iacob heb wherefore it is vndoubtedly true that he gaue these blessings vnto his children by faith now from this that isaac blessed his children by faith wee learne many instructions the first concerneth parents that howsoeuer they cannot as isaac did like prophets and patriarchs pronounce blessings vpon their children amp foretell what shall be their particular estate afterward yet if parents would as farre as they may followe the practice of isaac they should bring great comfort and consolation vnto their owne soules both in this life and in the life to come isaac set before his eyes all the promises that god had made both concerning him and his sonnes and by faith in these promises is moued to blesse his children so if parents would haue true comfort in their children they must search through the whole booke of god and see what promises god hath made vnto the godly and to their seed amp withall they must by faith apply vnto their own soules all these gracious promises endeuouring also to make their children to knowe the same and to walke worthie thereof and then as their obedience shall encrease so will their ioy encrease not onely in god but mutually one in another this will stay their hearts in all assaults yes euen in death it selfe secondly whereas isaac blessed his children by faith heere we may take iust occasion to speake of such wicked persons as are comonly called blessers who are too much esteemed of by many at this day and their wicked practises counted blessings and good meanes of helpe when as indeede they are most vile and wretched creatures this may be thought a hard censure because they are taken for cunning man and woman and for good people who followe isaacs example in blessing mens children and cattell they are thought to doe no harme at all but much good by helping strange mischaunces that befall man in their body children or goods thus would some excuse and defend these wizards and blessers who are the wretched limbs of the diuell but let vs knowe that if they will blesse aright it must be by faith now what faith haue they hath god made any promise to them that by their meanes hee will helpe those that come to seeke helpe at them for their children amp cattell nay verily there is no such matter god neuer made promise to any such nay hee hath flatly forbidden not onely such practices as they vse but also for man to seeke to any such persons and therefore they cannot blesse mens children and cattell by faith but they say they doe these things by faith yet it is by faith in the diuell and in his promises for this is certaine that as god hath his lawes and sacraments for those that enter couenant with him so on the contrary the diuell hath words spells and charmes as his lawes and rites wherein he exerciseth his slaues and by a satanicall faith in the diuels word and promise doe these wizards and wise woman blesse mens goods and children this is true by the common confession of many of them to omit all other proofe and therefore wee must hold them for the limbs of the diuell and his wicked instruments to drawe man from god and so in no case goe to them for any helpe for in so doing we forsake the liuing lord and his helpe and seeke for helpe at the diuell then which what can be more odious but say we receiue some outward helpe by their meanes yet marke the issue the lord hath said leuit if any turne after such as worke with spirits and after southsayers to goe a whoring after them then will i set my face against that person and will cut him off from among his people therefore vnlesse we feare not the curse of god we must be warned hereby not to seeke for helpe at their hands for they are gracelesse people who haue no feare of god before their eyes but they set themselues against god and his word and indeede these common blessers which seeme to doe no hurt but to blesse mens children and cattell are more dangerous then notorious witches who can onely hurt mens body and goods when god permits whereas these blessers ensnare the soule and drawe whole townes and country to the approbation and partaking of their wickednesse the third point to be considered is the parties blessed that is iacob and esau heere marke first the order which the holy ghost vseth hee setteth iacob in the first place and yet esau was the elder brother what is the reason of this answer we must knowe that the scripture vseth a three fold order in the naming of persons the order of nature as when the first borne is put first and thus dauids sonnes are numbred according to their age first ammon then daniell the third absolon ampc chronicles the order of dignitie when as those are put in the first place not which are the eldest but which are best and most in god fauour this order the holie ghost vseth in naming noahs sonnes genesis verse saying noah begat shem ham and iaphet when as iaphet was eldest and by order of nature should haue beene put first yet with shem god continued the couenant the order of historie when as one that is first or chief in dignitie is placed last because his historie begins in the last place so our sauiour christ is mentioned last in the genealogie made by saint matthew because his historie began in the last place though in dignitie hee were first and principall to apply this to our purpose the order which the holy ghost heere vseth is not the order of historie nor of nature but of dignitie because iacob was chiefe in the fauour of god therefore the holy ghost putteth him in the first place heere then wee see in this order of dignitie that the first blessing of life euerlasting belongs to iacob esau must haue his blessing but in the second place heere obserue these two thinges first iacob is receiued into god couenaunt and esau put by iacob gets the principall blessing and esau loseth it but what are these thinges so for iacobs desert or for the default of esau nay verily the good pleasure of god is the chiefe cause heereof for touching the blessing if wee reade the historie wee shall see that esau at his fathers commaundement went and hunted and tooke the paines and got his father venison and tolde him nothing but truth but iacob neuer went to hunt but gets a kid dressed and comes to his father with it and while hee talkes with his father doth foully gloase and lie so that in all reason it might seeme that esau deserued the better blessing yet god will haue it otherwise and the principall blessing belongs to iacob wherein wee may note that god speciall loue to man whereby hee receiues him into his couenaunt is not grounded on mans behauiour but on his owne good will and pleasure secondly in that iacob heere had the principall blessing wee learne that the counsell of god doth ouerrule the will of man for father isaac had purposed to haue blessed esau with the chiefest blessing but yet god counsell was contrarie and the same ouer rules isaacs will for though isaac had cause to suspect that it was not esau both because hee came so soone as also for that the voice was apparant not to be esaus but iacobs voice yet god counsell ouer ruled his will and when hee came to handle his sonnes handes hee could not discerne betweene a kiddes skinne and the skinne of a man whats the cause heereof surely it was god will and counsell that iacob should haue the chiefest blessing and therefore hee ouer rules isaacs will and blindes his senses and makes him to blesse iacob with the chiefest blessing the consideration heereof is profitable vnto vs for it is a receiued opinion with many at this day that god did purpose to saue all man now when question is made why then are not all man saued they answer because man will not though god will but this opinion is erroneous for it makes mans will to ouer rule god counsell as if they should say god willeth it not because man will it not or else which is worse god willeth it but it commeth not to passe because man will not doe it but god will and counsell is the highest and chiefest cause of al amp looke whatsoeuer he willeth that bringeth he to passe and because all man are not saued therfore we may safely thinke and say that god did neuer decree to saue all man now further more particularly of iacobs blessing first it may be asked how could iacob bee blessed seeing hee came dissemblingly and lying to his father answer wee must knowe that howsoeuer iacob sought the blessing by fraude yet he might bee blessed for he failed not neither did amisse in seeking for the blessing but onely in the manner of seeking it it was his duty to seeke it though not after that manner which hee did hee should rather haue staied that leisure and time wherein god had caused isaac to haue blessed him without his sinne in seeking it secondly consider the manner how iacob receiues his fathers blessing namely in his elder brother esaus garment here we may see a notable resemblance of god maner of blessing vs when wee looke for a blessing at god hand wee must not come in our owne garments in the rotten ragges of our owne righteousnes but we must put on christs garment the long white robe of his righteousnes and so comming vnto god as isaac said of the sauor of esaus garments which iaacob had put on gen behold the smell of my son is as the smell of a field god giue thee therefore of the dewe of heauen and the fatnesse of the earth and plenty of wheate and wine so will god say vnto vs that the righteousnesse of christ which wee haue put on by faith is a sweet smelling sauor in his nosthrils ephesian now seeing all the blessings we enioy come to vs in christ and our acceptance with god is in his righteousnes we therefore must labour to put on christ euery day by becoming new creatures we must seeke to resemble him in knowledge righteousnesse and holinesse so shall our assurance increase of god blessings vpon vs more and more lastly marke that howsoeuer iaacob was blessed otherwise than isaac had purposed yet after the blessing is pronounced it must needes stand for so when esau came isaac said vnto him i haue blessed iacob therefore hee shall be blessed ephesians euen so the ministers of god word in the assembly of the church who haue power to pronounce god blessings vpon the people howsoeuer they be but weake man and may be deceiued beeing subiect to error as other man are yet when they pronounce god blessing vpon their congregation in the ministery of the word if they doe it in sinceritie of heart and vprightnesse of conscience that blessing shall stand and so on the contrary looke whom they curse for iust cause out of god word their curse shall stand further as isaac blessed but knewe not whom so the ministers of god in the dispensation of the word they must blesse god people thogh they know not who they are particularly that doe receiue it thus much of isaacs blessing iacob now i come to his blessing of esau for hee also was blessed as the text saith yet in the second place albeit he were the elder brother quest how could esau be blessed at all seeing isaac had but one blessing answer esau was only blessed with temporall blessings and not with spirituall obiect but some wil say esau was a bad man amp wicked now it is said that to the impure all things are impure how then could the bestowing of teporal things be blessings to him an temporall things bestowed on the wicked are blessings amp no blessings they are blessings in regard of god that giues them but they are no blessings in regard of man that receiue them and vse them amisse quest how came it to passe that esau beeing the elder brother looseth his birth right and blessing both how came it to be iaacobs answer the cause was his profanenesse as wee may see and read in the next chapter where it is said heb that he solde his birth right for a portion of meate euen for a messe of redde broth and beeing so profane as to contemne so high an honour hee must bee content to haue his blessing in the second place and hence we may obserue a good instruction there is many a yong man in these our daies baptized as esau was circumcised and liuing in the church as hee did in isaacs house who during prime of his age is giuen to nothing but to his pleasure that is as good to him as iacobs redde broth was to esau take this pleasure fro him and take away his life herein is all his ioy and he delighteth in nothing so much as to spend his time in hunting hawking dicing gaming wantonnesse and drink now know for certaine this is a right esau and yet many such haue wee among vs who thinke of themselues that they are they iolly fellowes and they onely carrie the braue minde but as for iaacob and such as make conscience of their waies and words those alas are silly fellows now what is to be said or thought of these surely this if they doe not and that in time looke to their estates and to themselues it will cost them their liues euen the life of their soules esau lost his birth right by his profanenesse and so will these man doe if they continue in this estate they will blot their names out of the booke of life and roote themselues quite out of the kingdome of heauen therefore let all yong man whatsoeuer they bee high or lowe take heede how they liue in sinne and goe on in their wickednesse for if they take esaus course and continue in profanenesse doubtlesse they will haue esaus end how wonderfully doth satan bewitch them that while they goe on in sinne they should thinke so highly of themselues and so basely of those that make conscience of their waies wherefore in the feare of god let such betime redresse their waies and courses lest when god curse is vpon them they crie too late for mercy and thus much of the parties blessed the fourth point to be considered is the nature or matter of this blessing in the ende of the verse concerning things to come the meaning of these wordes is this that olde isaac their father did pronounce blessings vpon his sonnes not onely for the time present but also for the time to come in blessings temporall and spirituall as wee may read gen verse where hee giueth to them both the fatnesse of the land and plentie of wheat and wine and especially to iaacob that he should be lord ouer his brother but some will say it may seeme to prooue otherwise for while iaacob liued he was alwaies humble and subiect to esau and when he came to his owne country from among the aramites as he met with esau he sent presents to him and when he saw him he went before and bowed himselfe to the ground times vntill hee came neere to his brother answer that prophecie of iaacob and esau that the elder should serue the yonger must not be restrained to the persons of iaacob and esau but referred to their posteritie especially in the daies of dauid and salomon for then were the edomites who came of esau in subiection to the israelites the posteritie of olde ismael whereupon dauid speaking as a king saith psalm moab shall be my wash pot ouer edom will i cast my shooe meaning thereby that hee would bring the posteritie of esau into a base and lowe estate of subiection vnto him according as we may see verified sam but some will say that isaac when he blessed esau pronounced that he should haue a fertile soile and the fatnes of the earth should be his dwelling place gen whereas in malachie the lord saith mal he hated esau and a token thereof was this that hee had made his mountaines waste and his heritage a wildernesse for dragons meaning that he should dwell in a barren land how can these two agree answer first wee may say thus that the land of edom was a fertile land but yet in respect of the land of canaan but a barren and waste land secondly isaac speaks here of idumea as it was in his time not as it was afterward for it might be fertile in isaacs time yet after become barren for god will curse a land by turning fruitfulnesse into barrennesse for the wickednesse of them that dwell therein psalm and thus much for the example of isaacs faith now follow the examples of the faith of iacob by faith iacob when he was dying blessed both the sonnes of ioseph and worshipped on the end of his staffe in these words the holy ghost layes downe the notable and worthie example of iacobs faith which is heere commended by two actions first his blessing of the two sonnes of ioseph secondly his adoring or worshipping of god in the first action consider these points the blessing it selfe the circumstances belonging to the same as the time when iacob blessed them that is when hee was dying secondly by what meanes did hee blesse them namely by faith thirdly the parties blessed ephraim and manasses of these in order first for the blessing of this kinde of blessing wee entreated in the former verse in the example of isaacs faith and therefore neede not now repeate the same onely this wee must remember that this blessing of iacob is not the common or ordinarie blessing of a father but the extraordinarie blessing of an holy patriarch and prophet of god the blessing it self stands in three things iacob makes the sonnes of ioseph his own sonnes adopting them and taking them into his family and this is the meaning of those words in genesis where iacob saith as hee is blessing them let my name be named vpon them and the name of my fathers abraham and isaac gen that is they shall be receiued into my family and be my children called after my name he giues them two portions in the land of canaan for iacob was made an instrument of god by way of prophecie to distinguish and diuide the land of canaan among his children he doth as a prophet by the spirit of prophecie foretell the condition and estate of ephraim and manasses in their posterity to wit that they should be great nation and of them should come two great people in these three things doth iacobs blessing consist out of this blessing of iacob we learne two things first that god alloweth this liberty to a master of a family to adopt and chuse for the vpholding of his house a childe or children in the want of issue from his owne body for here olde iacob for the continuance of his posterity and the enlarging of the church of god adopteth his sonnes sonnes into his own family to be his own sonnes and this he doth by faith and therefore a lord and master in his family may doe the like but yet with this caueat hee must euer take heede that in this adopting he doe not vniustly hinder his owne issue or kindred againe whereas iacob blesseth these two sonnes of ioseph by fore telling the particular estate of their posterity for their portion in the land of canaan here wee learne that in many things god doth vouchsafe to reueale his will amp counsell in a speciall manner vnto them that be his children as in this place he reuealeth vnto iacob the particular estate of the two sonnes of ioseph in like manner when god was to destroy the sodomites shall i hide saith the lord from abraham that thing which i do seeing that abraham shall be indeede a mighty nation for i knowe him that he will commaund his sonnes and his houshold after him that they keepe the way of the lord and the prophet amos saith surely the lord will doe nothing but he reuealeth his secrets to his servant the prophets so saith our sauiour christ to his disciples ye are my friends and he giueth a reason because saith he i haue reuealed vnto you all that i haue heard of my father john so that those which are in christ the friends of god they shall in a particular and speciall manner knowe those things which god will not reueale vnto others and looke as this is here verified to iacob in a speciall manner so it is true generally in all god servant amp children hee reuealeth some particular things vnto them more then hee doth vnto others for besides that generall knowledge which they haue in his word he reueales particularly vnto them the knowledge of their owne election of their iustification sanctification and glorification to come though not by way of prophecie yet by the working of his spirit in the ministerie and meditation of his word and thus much of the blessing now followe the circumstances the circumstance to be considered is the time when iacob blessed the two sonnes of ioseph noted in these words when he was dying that is being ready to die not in the act of dying in this circumstance wee may learne two especiall duties one for masters of families the other for the ministers of god word for here iacob beares the person not onely of a father but of a prophet first masters of families are here taught to set in order their houses and families whereof they haue charge before they die for iacob hauing a great charge and many children calls for the sonnes of ioseph ephraim amp manasses before his death and makes them his owne to perfect his family quest how will some aske must a man set his house in order when he dies answer by doing two things after iacobs example for first he disposeth of his temporall things and distributeth his temporall inheritance in the land of canaan secondly he giues them charge of some duties concerning himselfe and some others especially concerning religion and god worship and then he dies as it is said when he had made an end of giuing charge vnto his sonnes he plucked vp his feete into his bed and gaue vp the ghost genesis so likewise masters of families they must set their houses in order by the like two duties by a due disposing of their temporall goods and possessions and by giuing exhortation and charge vnto their children and family concerning the worship of god and the practice of true religion this as wee may also reade kings was the practice of good king dauid when he was about to die and as he saith to goe the way of all flesh hee calls for salomon his son and makes him king in his stead and giues him a most notable charge concerning god worship verse reade the place it is worth the marking so the prophet isaiah when he comes to hezekiah from the lord hee aimes at these two and bids him set his house in order for hee must die and not liue isay and so ought euery master of a familie after their example both learne and practice these two duties secondly god ministers must hence learne their dutie for iacob was a notable minister and prophet in god church which was then in his family iacob he blesseth the sonnes of ioseph that he might receiue them into his family and into the couenant that so hee might continue and preserue the church of god after his death for looke as isaac his father did call him into the couenant and blessed him so dealeth hee with the two sonnes of ioseph and accordingly euery minister of god in his place ought to haue speciall care to conuay and deriue true religion and the gospel of christ from hand to hand so much as they can while they liue that so after their death it may be published and maintained in the new testament we haue a worthy commandemet for this purpose s paul hauing instructed amp taught timothy in the waies of godlines and religion chargeth him that what things he had heard and learned of him the same he should deliuer to faithfull man which should be able to teach other also that so god gospel and religion going on from hand to hand amp from person to person might increase from time to time s peters practice herein was notable pet i will endeauour therefore alwaies that yee may bee able to haue remembrance of the things of god after my departure hauing professed before that while he liued he would stirre them vp by putting them in remembrance v and in like sort all god faithfull ministers must doe their whole endeauour before they die that the gospel may be preached when they are gone circumstance by what meanes did iacob blesse the two sonnes of ioseph ans by faith in the promises of god so the text saith by faith iacob blessed the two sonnes of ioseph and if we consider the matter well wee shall see it was a notable faith for hee was now a poore pilgrime in egypt and yet by faith giues them portions in the land of canaan quest why will some say did hee not keepe himselfe in the land of canaan answer iacob indeede dwelt there for a time but yet as a soiourner hauing no more liberties than hee bought for himselfe no not so much as water for his camels or a place to bury the dead and besides he was driuen out of this his own land by famine and was faine to flie into egypt for food and sustenance and there to liue as a poore pilgrime and stranger forth of his owne countrey and yet for all this extremitie as though he had bin some mighty potentate of the world or some emperour hee makes his will amp bequeathes vnto his children the land of canaa allotting to euery one his part amp portion which must needs be a worke of a notable faith wonderfully apprehending amp applying the promise of god in his example wee are taught a notable dutie in the matter of our saluation when as any of vs by reason of the rigorous temptation of sinne and satan and by their assaults shall seeme to our selues to bee as it were thrust out of our inheritance in the heauenly canaan what must we doe we must not despaire but euen then set before our eies and call to remembrance the promises of god made vnto vs in christ concerning life euerlasting and theron we must rest and stay our selues then let temptations assault vs and driue vs whither they can still wee must holde fast the promise with both hands of faith and aboue hope by faith appoint and designe vnto our selues a part and portion in the kingdome of heauen and so doing wee shall bee true israelites and true followers of this faithfull patriarch who by faith beyond all likelihood allots the land of canaan to his posterity circumstance the parties whom he blessed namely the two sonnes of ioseph manasses and ephraim hereof wee may read at large gen ampc where among many things obserue this one ioseph brings his two sonnes manasses and ephraim vnto iaacob his father that hee might blesse them as he lay on his bedde now iosephs mind was that manasses the elder should haue the chiefest blessing and therefore he set manasses at iaacobs right hand and ephraim the yonger at his left but iaacob beeing to blesse them laies his hands a crosse putting his right hand on ephraims head and the left on the head of manasses whereby he gaue the birth right which was a principall prerogatiue vnto ephraim contrary to iosephs desire vnto manasses hee gaue a blessing also but farre inferiour to ephraims now here we may not thinke that iaacob did this vpon any fond affection as parents oftentimes doe because they loue one childe better than another but hee did it after a speciall manner by the direction and instinct of god spirit which so appointed it for when iaacob blessed them he knewe not of his owne knowledge by the benefit of his senses which was ephraim and which manasses againe looke as iaacob gaue the blessings at this time the principall vnto ephraim and the less to manasses so afterward they came to passe for as we may read the tribe of ephraim was farre more populous and more glorious than the tribe of manasses and therefore in the bookes of the prophets hos and and ampc we shall finde that the name of ephraim is giuen to all the ten tribes and they are called by that name because it was the most noble tribe of all and the most valiant and as it were the shelter of all the rest yes further of this tribe came chronicle iehosuae that noble captaine and king ieroboam and many other mighty kings of israel where we may learne that god is the disposer of honours and dignities in this world he giueth these to whom he will to some more and to some lesse as pleaseth him yes sometime he raiseth vp man of base and lowe degree to great dignitie as dauid saith psalm he raiseth the needy out of the dust and lifteth the poore out of the dongue now whence comes this is their learning their great strength their beautie or wonderfull skill and knowledge the cause of their preferment or the wealth of their parents or any thing in them no surely if we speake of the first cause wee see in this example that the preferment of ephraim aboue manasses was for no cause in ephraim for what was in ephraim that was not in manasses when iaacob blessed them surely nothing for hee was but a childe as the other was and a yonger childe also but hee was preferred by reason of god good will towards him and so it is with all those that are aduanced to preferment in this world wherefore seeing honour and dignity commeth not from themselues or any thing in them therfore they must not ascribe it to their owne wit learning strength or friends but wholly to the gift of god as the first cause and so must labour to vse it to the honour of him that onely giues it of his good pleasure else they sacrifice to their owne net hab quest why doth the holy ghost in this place put iosephs name downe who was not blessed and conceale the names of the two children that were blessed answer if wee reade the history in genesis wee shall see the reason hereof for when ioseph heard that his father iacob was sicke though he was a mighty prince and a noble potentate among the egyptians and his father but a poore pilgrime yet hee comes to his sicke father before his death and brings his two sonnes with him to haue his father to blesse them before he died and therfore the holy ghost heere nameth ioseph to shew vnto vs what respect he had of his fathers blessing hee made more account thereof and did more esteeme it that so he might haue his sonnes within the couenant than of all the kingdomes in the world and therefore he brings them both to his father to be blessed a little before his death now looke what minde amp affection ioseph beares the same should be in euery one of vs whatsoeuer our estate be whether honourable or base and meane wee must with ioseph esteeme more of god couenant amp to be members of god church then of all the honour in the world besides and we must esteeme our places and preferments that we haue or our children may haue to be nothing in comparison of the blessing of god and his fauour yes we must chuse with ioseph rather to leaue our honours and dignities for a time or if it were for euer then to lose the blessing of god grace and blessed shall those fathers be with ioseph who had rather haue their children blessed of god then aduaunced in the world the second action of iacobs faith is in these words and worshipped on the end of his staffe and it is a notable worke for the comendation of his faith but before we come vnto it there are certaine questions which may profitably be considered as first for the translation how the words should be read the papists read them thus and adored the top of his rod that is say they the top of iosephs scepter who came to visit him from whence they would gather and ground their abhominable idolatry in the adoration of creatures and namelie of holie things as crucifix reliques images as also of god at and before such holie things but we must know that their translation is false and erronious and cannot be iustified howsoeuer they may bring some mens witnesse and testimonie for the same for in reading it thus and adored the top of his rod they leaue out a substantiall word of the text to witte this word vpon whereby they corrupt the text and depraue the meaning of the holy ghost againe their obseruation and collection hence is most abhominable for to worshippe an image or other holy thing or god himselfe in or at the same is flatly forbidden in the second commaundement thou shalt not make to thy selfe any grauen image ampc thou shalt not bow downe to them but our translation in this place is true and right according to the wordes of the text and the meaning of the holy ghost that hee worshipped vpon the ende of his staffe yet further there may be a question moued about the words for if wee reade the historie in genesis it is there saide that iacob worshipped towards the end or toppe of his bed genesis now there is great difference betweene these two to worshippe on the toppe of his staffe and on the toppe of his bed how therfore can they stand together ans they may stand wel together and be both true for when iacob was about to giue vp the ghost and was ready to die hee raised vp himselfe vpon his pillowe towards the beds head and thereon rested his body now because his body was weake and feeble hee staide himselfe also vpon his staffe and thus comparing the places together we see there is no repugnancie in them againe this wee must knowe that the same sentence of scripture may be diuersly read in diverse places of scripture without any impeachment to the truth certainty or perfection of scripture for when the holy ghost speaketh the same thing often yet in different tearmes as in this place the diuersity of wordes doth enlarge or open the sense and meaning but no way corrupt or depraue the same and thus much for the words now to come to the fact it self in iacobs worship three circumstances are to be considered the occasion the time the manner of it the occasion of iacobs worship heere spoken of as we may reade genesis was this when the time drew neere that iacob must die hee called for his son ioseph and chargeth him deepely that hee should not burie him in egypt when hee was dead but that hee should carie him thence and burie him in the buriall of his fathers ioseph consents vnto his fathers request and yet iacob for certaintie makes him to sweare that hee shall doe so and ioseph sware vnto him now vpon this issue that iacob had with ioseph the text saith that israell worshipped towards the beds ead that is hee praised god and gaue thankes vnto him for this benefite that hee should be buried with his fathers abraham and isaac and yet this benefite did not so much concerne himselfe as his children for the carying of his bones thither was to be a token and pledge and a certaine assurance vnto them that the land of canaan should be theirs and that god would bring them thither againe in this circumstance obserue a notable dutie belonging vnto fathers and masters of families they must in their life time haue care of their posteritie and vse all meanes to helpe them and benefite them in the faith not onely while they are aliue but also after they are dead after the example of this holy patriarch and when they haue obtained this benefite for them they must be glad in their hearts and reioyce and thereupon take occasion to praise the lord as iacob did in this place circumstance the manner how hee worshipped which is set downe in these words on the end of his staffe this circumstance is worth the marking for good iacob by reason of the weakenesse of his body and olde age was not able to come forth of his bed and kneele downe or prostrate himselfe but raiseth himselfe vp vpon his pillowe towards his beds head and by reason of feeblenesse being not yet able to sit vpright he doth leane and beare himselfe vpon his staffe heere wee learne that wee must not onely worship god with our soules and hearts but with our body also for god hath created both and therefore will be worshipped in both corinthians verse olde iacob might haue excused himselfe that by reason of the weakenesse of his body hee was not able to adore god with any bodily reuerence but yet wee see hee leanes vpon his staffe and so making supply to his bodily weakenesse adoreth god with his bodie question in what kinde of gesture then must we worship god with our body answere the word of god doth not prescribe any by way of limitation for sometimes our sauiour christ prayed kneeling luke chapter verse sometimes groueling matthew chapter verse sometime standing john chapter verse as also did the apostles and the scripture approoueth the publican who stoode a farre off and prayed luke chapter verse elijah also kings chapter verse is saide to pray with his head betweene his legges so that wee haue no certaine forme prescribed vs onely this wee must vse that gesture which may best set forth and declare our humble heart and holy affection vnto god here then is confuted an opinio of those which thinke that a man may worship god with his heart amp yet worship images with his body that he may bee present at idolatrous worship yet keep his heart vnto god but iacobs behauiour in this place doth both confute and condemne them for he thought his body as due to god as his soule and therefore worshipped god with both circumstance the time when hee worshipped god thus namely when he was dying euen then he worshipped god in this circumstance we may note diverse things first here behold the bad practice of the world for many man when they are dying now adaies are so farre from following iacobs example in worshipping and praising god that then they are faine to call for man to teach them how they should worship god hauing spent the former part of their life carelesly in regard of their soules following worldly profit and pleasures neuer thinking of their duty to god till they die but what a fearefull course is this that man should thus brutishly goe on from day to day not knowing how to worship god well all such as loue their owne soules and would be like to godly iacob or as our sauiour christ said to nathaniel would be true israelites ioh the naturall sonnes of old israel indeede they must haue care so to liue in this world that they may worship god when they die amp therfore they must not deferre but learne betime the knowledge and feare of god that when death comes they may bee able to shewe forth and practice the same it is a lamentable thing to cosider how the diuel bewitcheth mens hearts so as they liue in the world as though they should neuer goe out of it neuer caring for religion till the day of death come vpon the amp then it is too late to learne but this is to followe esau and not iacob who is therefore condemned by the holy ghost againe in this that iacob worshipped god at his death we learne this that as man liue so they die for the most part iacob was brought vp in god worship amp therein liued all his life long and looke as hee liued so he died for when he died hee worshipped god resting his body on the end of his staffe this same truth is verefied now and shal be for euer let a man worship god through the course of his life and when he dieth he shal be able to worship amp praise god on the other side take notice of it he that liues in couetousnes in profanenesse in fornication and wantonnes for the most part so dies come to a couetous man at his death and talke with him and you shall finde nothing in him ordinarily but rauing amp talking about his bargaines his billes and indentures amp other worldly things and so wee may say of other lewd liuers looke what minde they had while they were liuing amp that shall you find most in their mouthes while they are dying which shewes plainely that as man liue so they die but some will say that oftentimes the godly man raues and speakes lewdly and it may be profanely before his death ans it is true indeed the best man is not freed from any kind of bodily sicknesse but is subiect to them as well as the wicked as to burning feuers and such like by the violence and rage of which diseases they are often driuen to raue to speake fondly and sometimes lewdly yes it may be profanely but what is that to the purpose for thogh a godly man for the time of his fit cannot expresse the grace of his heart but rather the corruption of his nature yet whe he hath recouered himselfe he is sory for the same amp is then ready amp willing to praise god with all his heart so that if wee would die well as iacob did praising god then let vs lead our liues as he did namely by faith and the direction of his word and promises then come death when it will and how it will wee may indeede be sore assaulted by sickenesse and temptation but yet we shall neuer be ouercome for god is faithfull that hath promised an issue to his children in temptatio corinthian lastly whereas iacob worshipped god at his death here we learne that sound zeale will neuer decay many man haue zeale indeede but it comes onely from the strength and soundnesse of their bodily constitution and looke as strength decaies so doth that kind of zeale but sound zeale will not decay and weaken with the body but as dauid saith of the righteous psalm will flourish like a palme tree and growe like a cedar in libanon it shall still bring forth fruit in a mans age and flourish this wee see was true in iacob for though he were old and feeble with sicknesse yet he sheweth forth sound zeale in his heart at the houre of his death euen so will it be with vs that professe religion if zeale be sound in our hearts it will shew it selfe and the older wee are the more fruits of grace wee shall bring forth and then shew forth more true zeale than in yonger yeares for though bodily strength decay yet sound zeale will neuer decay but when strength faileth then will zeale flourish if it bee sound like to the palme tree which will bud and sprout though the roots of it bee cut off wherefore if wee would shew forth zeale in our age we must get soundnesse of it in our youth for that will put forth it selfe in the time of death and thus much of iacobs example by faith ioseph when he died made mention of the departing of the children of israel and gaue commandement of his bones wee haue heard in the former verses the seuerall examples of the faith of the three patriarchs abraham isaac and iacob now in this verse the holy ghost setteth downe the example of iosephs faith the words in this verse are plaine and easie amp neede no exposition they are a plaine and briefe summe of the ende of the chapter of genesis let vs therefore come to the points of doctrine and instructions which are to bee learned and gathered forth of the words first note in generall the great resemblance of this example with the former of ioseph a godly son with iacob a godly father for both of them shew forth their faith when they die for it is said of both by faith when hee died so that in ground and circumstance of time they both agree herein we may obserue first that the good examples of superiours vvhether they be ciuill or ecclesiasticall are of great force to bring other man on and to make them forward in the duties of religion their zeale as paul saith to the corinthians in the case of almes prouoketh many iacob the father beeing a worthy prophet and patriarch amp giuing an holy and blessed example vnto ioseph and his children doth shew forth at his death most notable behauiour wherein hee worthily expresseth the trueth of his faith now his example works with ioseph and he in his death behaues himselfe in the same manner that his godly father did before him and therfore superiours must look to all their sayings and doings carefully that they may bee worthy examples to their inferiours to drawe them on in religion and in the feare of god secondly hence inferiors also must learne to follow the godly holy and religious examples of their gouernours and superious whether they be ciuill or ecclesiasticall as we may see in this place ioseph doth imitate the godly example of his father iacob hereof saint paul giueth straite charge vnto the philippians saying brother be followers of me and looke on them which walke so as ye haue vs for an example philipp and in the next chapter exhorting them to honest conuersation hee biddes them doe those things which they had heard receiued and seene in him but are these duties practiced among vs bee the elder sort teachers of good things to the yonger amp doe the yonger follow their elders in wel doing nay verily but such are our times too many among vs both those that giue and those which follow good examples are as signes amp wonders as the prophet speaketh they are made a reproach amp a by word among man and are foully disgraced by odious tearmes isay but this indeede is a practice of ismael that mocked isaac genesis ver and we againe must vndoubtedly know that vnlesse it be reformed that hand of god which hath beene stretched out against vs in manie fearefull iudgements will not be pulled backe but stretched out still till it bring vs to destruction for god will not suffer his ordinances to be contemned and his holy ones to be abused hee looketh for better fruites at our hands and therefore wee must learne of these godly patriarches both to giue and to followe good examples in the example of ioseph more particularly wee are to obserue two points iosephs faith the actions of his faith whereby it is commended for the first it is saide that by faith ioseph when hee died ampc ioseph for ought wee finde in scripture had not such meanes to come by faith as his auncestors had before him for the three patriarches abraham isaac and iacob had otherwhiles the appearance of god vnto them otherwhile his holy angels brought them messages from god and sometime they had his will reuealed vnto them by dreames and visions all which were notable helpes and meanes both to beginne and to encrease faith in them but ioseph wanted all these meanes or at least many of them for reade his whole historie and you shall not finde that either angell appeared vnto him or else that god by dreames and visions spake vnto him and no meruaile for hee liued out of the visible church where god presence was in superstitious and idolatrous egypt and yet for all this hee is heere matched in the matter of faith with the three worthie patriarchs it is then a good question how ioseph should come by this faith answer we must knowe this that though he had not the like extraordinarie meanes with the patriarches yet he wanted not all meanes for in his younger dayes hee was trayned vp in his father iacobs family and by him was instructed in the wayes of god and in the practice of religion and in his later dayes also he had the benefit of his fathers company and instructions in egypt now iacob was not an ordinarie father but a notable patriarch and an holy prophet in whose family god had placed his visible church in those dayes wherin iacob was the lord prophet and minister now ioseph both in his young age and also after his father came to egypt did heare and learne of him the wayes of god and by that meanes came to this excellent faith for which he is so commended here and matched with his fathers the holy patriarchs hence we learne that the preaching of god word by his ministers though extraordinarie meanes as reuelations and visions be wanting is sufficient to bring a man to faith yes to such a faith as the three patriarchs had indeede in the ministerie of the word hee which speaketh vnto vs is but a man as others are but yet the word which he deliuereth is not his own but the mighty word of god and looke what is truly pronounced by him vnto vs out of god word the same is as certainly sealed vnto vs by his spirit as if god himselfe from heauen should extraordinarily reueale the same and howsoeuer in former times man had visions and dreames and angels from god himselfe to reueale his will vnto them yet this ministerie of god word in the new testament is as sufficient a meanes of the beginning and encreasing of true faith as that was then this plainly confuteth all those that neglect or contemne the ministerie and preaching of the word amp looke for extraordinarie reuelations and for visions amp dreames for the begetting and encrease of faith and grace in their hearts but our sauiour christ doth notably checke all such in the parable of the rich man by the words of abraham to diues saying of diues brother that they had moses and the prophets if they will not heare them neither will they beleeue though one should come from the dead againe verse insinuating that if a man will not beleeue by the preaching of the word there is nothing in the world will make him to beleeue neither reuelations nor visions no not the words of them that rise againe from the dead secondly the consideration of the sufficiencie of god ordinance in the holy ministerie to beget and to encrease true faith must stirre vs vp to all care and diligence not onely to heare the word of god preached vnto vs but to profit by it both in knowledge and obedience and thus much for the first point the second point to be handled is the commendation of iosephs faith by two actions thereof to wit his mention of the departure of the children of israell out of egypt his commaundement concerning his bones of both which we will speake briefely because the speciall points herein were handled in the former verse for the first ioseph when hee died made mention of the departing of the children of israell that is out of egypt into canaan here we may obserue a most notable worke of faith it makes a man to keepe in memory the mercifull promises which god hath made vnto him this is it which commends iosephs faith for a liuely faith that being about to die he remembreth this mercifull promise of god made to his fore fathers touching their posterity to wit that after they had cotinued as servant in a strange land yeares they should then haue a good issue and a happy deliuerance and be brought into the land of canaan gen this is a notable work of faith as may appeare by two notable effects hereof in the life of a christian for first by this remembrance of god mercifull promises the servant of god at all times and in all distresses and extremities doth finde comfort vnto his soule this brings to his memory the wonderfull goodnesse and mercy of god by which he is comforted when dauid was in a most desperate case so as he cried out by reason of affliction and temptation will the lord absent himselfe for euer and will hee shew no more fauour is his mercy cleane gone doth his mercy faile for euermore psalm with such like most fearefull speaches how did he then comfort himselfe in this distresse answer surely by remembring the works of the lord and his wonders of olde and by meditating in all his workes and gracious acts which he had done for him so likewise in another place in great anguish of spirit he saith to his soule why article thou cast down my soule and why article thou disquieted within me psalm yet in the next words hee thus stayes himselfe waite on god for i will yet giue thankes vnto him he is my present help and my god how came dauid to say so in this distresse answer by meanes of faith which doth reuiue and refresh the dead heart of man by bringing to his remembrance the mercifull promises of god saint paul pressed with corruption cried out o wretched man that i am who shall deliuer me from the body of this death rom yet in the next words he saith i thanke my god through iesus christ our lord then i my selfe in my minde serue the law of god ampc how come the latter words to followe on the former answer in the first words indeede he is cast downe with the view and sight of his naturall corruption which drew him headlong into sinne but yet the later words are a remembrance of the mercifull deliuerance from sinne which god had wrought in him by christ and therefore hee breaketh out to this saying i thanke my god through iesus christ ampc secondly the remembrance of god promises serueth to be a meanes to keepe a man from sinne for mans nature is as readie and prone to sinne as fire is to burne when fewell is put to it but when by faith hee calls to minde god mercifull promises especially those which are made vnto him in christ then he reasoneth and striueth against temptation and layes the word as a shield vnto his soule to keepe out the fierie darts of satan yes hee applies the same word to his owne soule as a corrosiue vnto corruption whereupon it is said that faith purifieth the heart act how namely beside the applying of christs blood it brings to memory god mercifull promises in christ which stay a man from committing such things as would pollute and defile the heart and therefore is faith said to bee our victory ouer the world ioh because by applying to our soules god promises in christ we doe not onely contemne the world in regard of christ but also stand against the assaults thereof so that it is a most notable and excellent worke of faith lastly obserue the circumstance of time when ioseph made remembrance of their departing the text saith when he was dying hereof wee haue spoken in the former verse yet this one thing may here againe bee well remembred ioseph cals to mind the promises of god at his death which concerne the temporall deliuerance of his people amp we by his example when we are dying must learne to call to remembrance the gracious promises which god hath made vnto vs in christ touching our eternall deliuerance from the spirituall bondage of the diuell oh great will bee the fruit hereof not onely for inward comfort to our own soules and ioy to such as loue vs but also we shall hereby giue a worthy euidence to the world that we haue bin sound in the faith wherein we shall leaue a good president to those that follow vs the second fact of iosephs faith is this he gaue commandement concerning his bones the meaning thereof is this that ioseph lying on his death bed gaue a solemne charge to his brother to haue speciall care how and where they buried him that his bones might not be lost but so preserued while they staied in egypt that at their departure they might be carried into the land of canaan amp there buried in the sepulchre of his fathers the causes why ioseph gaue this commandement were these hereby to testifie vnto his brother amp posterity that howsoeuer he liued a long time in the pompe and glory of egypt yet his heart was neuer set thereon but hee had a greater delight and more esteemed to bee counted a true member of the church of god than to be a noble prince in the land of egypt for if hee had loued and liked the pompe of egypt hee would haue had his sepulchre among them but giuing commandement to the contrary it sheweth plainely that his heart was neuer set on that glory and pompe in which he liued by whose exaple we are taught that in vsing the world and the things therof we must not set our hearts on them but as the apostle saith corinthian vse them as though wee vsed them not still hauing our affections set on heauen which is our spirituall canaan hereby ioseph would testifie vnto his brother what he esteemed his chiefe happinesse namely that in faith amp hope he was ioyned vnto his fathers and auncestors that beleeued in god and that hee was of their religion and looked for a resurrection and another life as they did and this he would haue knowen not only to his brother and posteritie but to the egyptians also among whom he liued ioseph hereby intended principally to confirme the faith of his brother and posterity in god promise for enioying and possessing the land of canaan after his death and this was a notable way to strengthen their faith for when they should see or remember his corps it was vnto them as a liuely sermon to shew them plainely that howsoeuer they liued for a while in bondage in egypt yet the day should shortly come wherein they should be set at libertie and brought as free man into the land of canaan and vndoubtedly ioseph would therefore haue his bones kept among them that they might be a pledge vnto them of their deliuerance yes note further the story saith gen that ioseph did not onely charge his brother generally but bindes them by an oath to carry his bones hereby shewing that it was a matter of great weight which hee did inioyne them euen a signe and pledge of the truth of god promise in their deliuerance whence we learne that it is a matter of great moment for euery christian both carefully and reuerently to vse the sacraments which god hath giuen as pledges of his couenant of grace made with vs in christ for shall ioseph cause his brother and posteritie to sweare concerning his bones that so they might more reuerently regard that pledge and signe of their outward deliuerance and shall not we with all reuerence amp good conscience both esteeme and vse those holy pledges of our eternall deliuerance by christ iesus the papists from this place would iustifie their practice in reseruing and honouring the reliques of saints now by reliques they meane the parts of the body of saints departed as the head of john baptist the armes or bones of this or that saint the milke of the virgin mary and also the parts of the crosse whereon christ suffered with such like answer first let vs knowe that their reliques are nothing else but forged deuices of their owne and no true reliques of saints as by one instance may appeare for the parts and parcels of wood kept in europe which they say are parts of the crosse whereon christ died are so many that if they were all gathered together they would load a ship which shewes plainely that herein they vse notorious forgerie for it was no greater than a man may beare and the like is their behauiour in the rest secondly the keeping of iosephs bones was for a good ende and purpose namely to testifie his owne faith and to confirme theirs in beleeuing god promise for their deliuerance out of the bondage of egypt but their reliques serue rather to extinguish faith in christ than to confirme it for they nourish man in fond deuices and foul superstitions and not in the truth of god promises thirdly we doe not read in all the bible that iosephs bones were euer worshipped and therefore from this place they haue no ground whereon to build their superstitious worshipping of reliques and thus much of the example of iosephs faith by faith moses when he was borne was hid three moneths of his parents because they saw he was a proper childe neither feared they the kings commandement in this verse the holy ghost proceedeth further and setteth downe vnto vs a notable and worthy example of the faith of moses parents if we would see the history at large we must read the chapter of exodus of which these words are an abbridgement or briefe epitome now here the faith of moses parents is commended vnto vs by two notable actions the hiding of moses their childe when he was borne their courage and boldnesse in that action in not fearing the kings commandement of their hiding of him we will first intreat generally and then come to the circumstances thereof in generall their hiding of the childe was this they kept him close and vnknowen to the egyptians for three moneths space because the king had giuen commaundement and charge to all his people that they should drowne euery man childe born among the hebrewes exod in this action of their faith we may obserue some speciall points first moses was to be a worthy prophet and captaine or guide vnto the people of israell and therefore howsoeuer other man children were drowned vpon the cruell commaund of pharaoh yet the lord prouides for him so soone as he is borne that he shal be hid and so preserued from the tyrannie and rage of pharaoh whence wee learne that god in the middest of all persecution doth euermore preserue the seede of his church there be two estates of god church in the world the first is quiet and peaceable when the gospell is publikely professed taught and receiued without hostile opposition as by god great mercy it is in our church at this day the second is an hidden estate when as it cannot shew it selfe visible but the open profession of the gospel is suppressed by the rage of the enemie the diuell and by wicked amp cruell man that be his instruments thus god suffereth his church somtimes to be shadowed and in these times many of his deere children to be slaine amp put to death for the sins of his church yet so as that alwaies he preserues the seede of his church when isay had shewed the iewes the fearefull desolation of their land that the cities should be wasted without inhabitant amp their houses without man yet then he saith there shall be a tenth in it and the holy seede shall be the substance or vnderprop thereof verse god doth not deale with his church as hee doth with the enemy thereof hee but loppes off the branches in his church when as hee stockes vp the roote of the enemy isay chapter verses when hee visited sodome and gomorrah hee destroyed them vtterly out of the earth but the lord doth euer keepe fast the seede of his church that when the storme of persecution is blowen ouer his church may spring and flourish afterward here some may say seeing god purposed to make moses such a worthy man ouer his people why did he not by some wonderfull powerfull and mighty manner preserue him against the rage of pharaoh answer god indeede was able to haue sent a legion of angels for his preseruation or to haue done it after some strange visible manner but yet he would not for we must knowe and remember that it is god pleasure to shew his power in weak means he can preserue euery servant of his from all kinde of iniurie but he will not alwaies doe so when christ himselfe our sauiour was in his infancie persecuted by herod god his father was then able to haue preserued him in iudea and to haue ouerthrowen his persecutor by manie legions of angels yet hee would not but onely vseth the poore helpe of ioseph and marie with the ordinarie weake meanes of flight and all this hee did that hee might be glorified in the weakenesse of his servant for when all meanes faile then doth hee magnifie his power and prouidence in preseruing those that trust in him and thus much of this action in generall the circumstances to be considered in the hiding of moses are foure the time when hee was hid the text saith when hee was borne moses as wee saide must be afterward a notable servant and a worthy instrument of god whereby hee would worke the deliuerance of his people out of the bondage of egypt and yet we see he is faine to be hid so soone as he is borne hence wee learne that those that be the servant of god and are in speciall fauour with him must looke for trouble and affliction in this life from the cradle to the graue from the day of their birth to the houre of their death moses is in danger of his life by pharaoh so soone as hee is borne and so was our sauiour christ by herod when hee was but a babe whereupon his parents fled with him into egypt for his safety and aunswerable to their infancie was the rest of their life full of danger full of trouble and as it was with them so is it with others timothie chapter verse hee that will liue godly must suffer persecution and hee that will be christes disciple must take vp his crosse euery day and followe him luke this is a point which all of vs must marke wee must not looke to haue ease and ioy in earth it is enough for vs to enioy that after this life if christ himselfe carie his crosse out of the gate we then with his disciples must take vp our crosse and followe him euery day the circumstance to bee considered is this how long was moses hid namely three moneths question why was he hid no longer answer because they could not for it is likely there was search for him and therefore they made a basket of reed and dawbed it with slime and pitch and laid the childe therein and put it among the bul rushes by the river brinke thus did the parents adventure the childes life for the sauing of their owne wherein we may see a great want and weakenesse in their faith for they kept their childe a while by faith but afterward comitted him to the dangers of the water of wilde beast and fowles of the aire so that it is plaine their faith was weake and mingled with feare and with some doubting for in keeping the childe three moneths they shew forth liuely faith but when as they expose him to danger for their owne safety heerein they bewray some want of loue and weakenesse of faith and yet we see they are heere commended for their faith which sheweth plainely that if a man haue true and sound faith though it be but weak yet god in mercy will take knowledge of it and commend it passing by the weakenesse of it yes and vnto that faith will giue the promises of life euerlasting made in christ the third circumstance to bee considered is this who it was that kept moses three moneths in exodus it is said that his mother kept him but here it is said his parents kept him where the holy ghost includes his father also how can both these be true answer wee must knowe that the mother was the chiefe doer in this worke and the father though he was not a doer yet he gaue his consent now we must remember that consent is a kinde of doing whether it be in good things or in euill for when saul did but keepe the persecutors cloth that stoned stephen act whereby he signified his consent thereupon hee confesseth himselfe to bee guiltie of his death act lastly obserue the cause or rather the occasion that mooued the parents to saue their childe it was a notable comlinesse and beautie which did appeare in the body of the childe when hee was borne this mooued them to reason thus with themselues surely god hath giuen such beautie and comelinesse vnto this childe that it is very likely he will vse him hereafter to be some notable instrument of some great worke we therefore will keepe him aliue this point must be marked of vs for beside their natural affection this also was a motiue to make the parents saue their childe hence wee may learne that those whom god will imploy aboue others in some speciall seruice for his owne glory are vsually endowed with some speciall gift aboue others yes many times with outward grace and comelinesse in the body for this beauty in moses body moued his parents to seeke to saue his life they perswade themselues that god had not imprinted that in him for nought saul wee know was made king ouer israel and it is noted that the lord had giuen him a goodly stature for hee was higher than any of the people from the shoulders vpward so dauid had a good countenance and a comely visage for the lord purposed to make him king ouer israel now as he did excell his brother in beauty and comelinesse so he was to be far aboue them in this special seruice of god in gouerning his people hence we learne first that comelinesse and beautie is a gift of god secondly that those which excell others in these gifts of nature must looke also that answerably they excell them in holinesse and zeale in the seruice of god and doing good vnto man as moses and dauid did but alas wretched is the practice of these times for commonly those which haue comlinesse and beauty aboue others doe vse it as a bait amp occasion vnto all sin amp naughtinesse as to whoredome and lasciuiousnesse that heereby they may more fully satisfie their own wretched and fatanicall lusts but this must carefully be looked vnto of all such as haue the gifts of nature in more excellent manner then others for if they vse them or rather abuse them to be meanes of sinne and to set forth the pride and vanity of their hearts they haue much to answer for vnto god at the dreadfull day of iudgement hath god giuen thee beauty amp comelinesse and doest thou vse it as a baite to ensnare others for the satisfying of thy lust then looke vnto it thou euill servant for thou doest not hide but consume thy masters talent imploying it to his dishonour therefore it shall be taken from thee and in stead thereof thou shalt haue vglinesse and deformity and so in soule and body be tumbled into hell with vncleane spirits and thus much of the first action of their faith with the circumstances thereof the second action whereby the faith of moses parents is commended vnto vs is this they did not feare the kings commaundement these words must not be vnderstoode absolutely and simply but with limitation for manie places of scripture are spoken simply which must bee vnderstoode with respect as when it is said math john came neither eating nor drink that is not eating nothing at all but eating little and christ saith math he came not to bring peace but the sword that is as luke expounds it luke rather debate than peace and so in this place moses parents feared not the kings commandement that is they did not feare it ouermuch or wholly or onely or so much as others did in the like case here then first we may learne how farre forth we must obey superiours and magistrates we must obey them not simply but in the lord ephesian that is in all their lawful commands but when they commaund things euill and unlawful then we must stay our selues lest obeying them we rebell against god for this wee haue sufficient warrant in this place as also in the apostles who beeing commanded act that in no wise they should speake or teach in the name of iesus answered whether it be right in the sight of god to obey you rather than god iudge ye and the midwiues of egypt are commended of the holy ghost exod for sauing the yong children aliue against the kings commandement and the three man of the iewes shadrach meshach and abednego are renowmed with all posterity for disobeying the commandement of nebuchadnessar daniel of worshipping the golden image by which examples we may see plainely that our obedience to man must be in the lord onely neither is our refusing to doe their unlawful commaunds any disobedience indeede because the fift commandement in this case ceaseth to binde and giues place to the commandements of the first table which are greater as wee shewed before v secondly see here this godly boldnesse in not ouermuch fearing the kings commandement is made a worke of faith whence we learne that true faith in the promises of god doth serue to moderate a mans affections there is no man but if he be left to himselfe he will goe too farre in the sway of his affections experience sheweth that many through anger and ioy haue lost their liues some for feare haue forsaken religion and sorrow hath cost many a man his life yes any affection if it be not moderated and stayed will bereaue a man of his senses and make him a beast and no man but behold the vse and power of true faith it serueth to mitigate a mans affection so as if a man be angry it shall be with moderation and so wee may say of feare ioy hatred or any other affection faith will asswage and stay the rage thereof for vndoubtedly moses parents might haue beene ouerwhelmed with feare of pharaohs tyrannie and cruelty but that god gaue the faith which did moderate this feare there is none of vs but if wee looke well into our selues wee shall see that we are excessiue in many affections sometime in feare sometime in anger sometime in sorrow and such like now would we know how to bridle these strong passions then get true faith it is the meanes whereby a man may moderate and stay the rage of his affectios so as they shall not break out into extremitie is a man angrie why if hee haue faith hee will bridle his anger is he sorrowfull yet it is in measure and so for the rest faith will rule them all and yet extinguisheth none which should greatly prouoke vs to labour for true faith seeing it is of such vse and power in the stay of our affections verse by faith moses when he was come to age refused to bee called the son of pharaohs daughter and chose rather to suffer aduersitie with the people of god than to enioy the pleasures of sinne for a season esteeming the rebuke of christ greater riches than the treasures of egypt for hee had respect vnto the recompence of reward here the holy ghost comes to the commendation of moses faith and in these three verses propounds a most notable example hereof by moses faith in this place we must vnderstand sauing faith which is nothing else but a gift of god whereby moses receiued the promise of god touching saluation by the messias and of the promised land made to abraham and to his seede after him and applied the same vnto himselfe particularly now in the first entrance of this exaple the holy ghost setteth downe a wonderfull thing of moses namely that moses had faith and by it did this great worke this i say is strange because he was brought vp by pharaohs daughter in the court of pharaoh where was no knowledge of the true god and indeede nothing but idolatry wantonnesse and profanenesse and yet heere it is testified of him by the spirit of god which cannot lie that hee had faith which is a wonderfull thing and the like is recorded of others in the word of god as in ahabs court who was a king that had sold himselfe to worke wickednesse yet the spirit of god testifieth that euen there was good obadiah a man that feared god greatly and herod was a most deadly enemie to christ and yet ioanna the wife of chuza herods friend ministred of her goods vnto christ and paul saith the saints which are of caesars houshold salute you where by caesars house is meant the court of nero who was a most bloudy man and a wicked persecuter and yet in his house were the professors of christs gospell by these examples we learne that christ hath his children and servant in the middle among his enemy for these courts of pharaoh herod and nero may be called a kinde of hell amp yet there were some of god servant in them all which sheweth vs clearely the truth of god word which saith of christ that he raigneth in the middle among his enemy howsoeuer they rage and seeke to blot out his name and to roote out his kingdom yet maugre their throats he will rule in the middle of their kingdoms amp there haue those which truly serue him amp feare his name revelation god had his church in pergamus where satans throne was againe this faith of moses serues to checke many a man in this age that is brought vp in the church of god and vnder godly parents amp gouernours and yet is a hater and mocker of the religion of christ surely moses in the day of iudgement shall stand vp against all such and condemne them for he had faith though he were brought vp in a most profane place and they are voide of faith nay enemy vnto it though they liue in the bosome of the church but let vs come to the strange fact which moses did for which his faith is so commended the text saith of him first of all that when he was come to age he refused to be called the son of pharaohs daughter how moses became her son we may reade at large exod where it is said that she hauing found moses in the basket preserued him aliue and brought him vp as her own childe purposing to make him her owne son amp heire but this honour of hers he would not accept this hee refused by faith and this is that notable and famous act for which his faith is here comended vnto vs but some will say this fact of moses may seeme rather worthy of blame then praise as being a practice of great rudenesse and ingratitude for shee preserued his life from death and brought him vp as her owne childe and vouchsafed him this speciall fauour to make him her heire and therefore moses should not thus haue contemned her fauour answer indeede it had beene moses part to haue shewed himselfe thankfull in accepting this fauour at her hands and also in enioying the same if hee might haue done it with the feare of god and keeping a good conscience but that he could not doe for if he had dwelled still with her and beene her son and heire hee should haue beene vndutifull vnto god now this is a rule to bee remembred and practiced alwayes that in duties of like nature the commaundements of the second table doe binde vs no further then our obedience thereto may stand with obedience vnto the commaundements of the first table and when these two cannot stand together then we are freed from obedience vnto the second table as from performing honour and thankfulnesse vnto man when wee cannot therewithall performe obedience and seruice vnto god and this was moses case because hee could not both serue god and continue his thankfulnesse to pharaohs daughter for in staying with her hee should haue made shipwracke of true religion therefore hee forsaketh her fauour and honour and for this cause is heere commended vnto vs the like did our sauiour christ for when the people would haue made him king he refused it and fled from among them john because it would not stand with that calling for which he was sanctified and sent into the world therefore moses fact was commendable and doth greatly set forth vnto vs his holy faith in this fact of moses thus generally considered obserue a notable fruite of true faith it makes a man to esteeme more of the state of adoption to be the childe of god then to be the childe or heire of any earthly prince this is plaine in moses in this place and the like we may see in dauid for though he were a king yet he set all his royalty and maiestie at nought in regard of god blessing of adoption amp therefore saith the lord not the kingdom of israel is my portion and again when he was kept from the lord tabernacle amp the company of god saints through persecution he saith the sparrowes and swallowes were more happy then he psalm because they had nests where they might keepe their young and sit and sing but hee could not come neere the lord altar and yet more fully to expresse the earnestnesse of his affection this way he saith he had rather be a man of a base office euen a dore keeper in the house of god then a man of renowne in the tents of wickednesse but howsoeuer these man were of one minde herein yet come to our age and seeke in towne country and people and we shall see this fruite of faith is rare to be found for generally though i will not say all the most of those that are borne of good parentage as the sonnes of knights or squires and especially of nobles are so bewitched with the pride of their earthly parentage that they haue scarce a thought after adoption in christ god heauenly graces will take no place in their hearts but they vtterly contemne all other estates of life in regard of their owne and this is the common sinne of the whole world for at earthly preferments man wil stand amazed but seldome shall you finde a man that is rauished with ioy in this that he is the childe of god as moses did but his practice must be a president for vs to followe we must learne to haue more ioy in being the sonnes of god then to be heires of any worldly kingdomes and to take more delight in the grace of adoption through iesus christ then in the sonship of any earthly prince it is a great prerogatiue to be heire to a king or emperour but yet to be the childe of god goes farre beyond it euen aboue comparison for the son of the greatest potentate may be the childe of wrath but the childe of god by grace hath christ iesus to be his eldest brother with whom he is fellow heire in heauen hee hath the holy ghost also for his comforter and the kingdome of heauen for his euerlasting inheritance and therefore wee must learne of moses from the bottome of our hearts to prefer this one thing to be the child of god before all earthly things either pleasures riches or any other prerogatiues whatsoeuer now more particularly in this fact of moses note two circumstances the manner how the time when he refused to be called the son of pharaohs daughter for the first his refusall was not in word but in deede for if we reade the whole history of moses wee shall not finde that either he spake to pharaoh or to his daughter or to any other to this effect that hee would not be her heire nor called her son but we finde that hee did it in deede for when he came to age he left the court oftentimes and went to visite his brother to comfort them to defend them and to take part with them and hence we must learne not so much to giue our selues to knowe and to talke of matters of religion as to doe and practice the same both before god and man this did moses it is the common fault of our age that we can be content to heare the doctrine of religion taught vnto vs yes many will learne it and often speake thereof but fewe there be that make conscience to doe the things they heare and speake of but let vs learne of moses to put those things in practice which wee learne and professe and in silence doe them for the fewer words the better vnlesse our deedes be answerable if any of vs were to walke vpon the top of some high mountaine we would leaue off talking and looke vnto our steps for feare of falling behold when we enter the profession of christianity wee are set vpon an high mountaine for the way of life is on high and christianity is the high calling of god we therefore must be wise as salomo saith pro amp look wel to our couersation hauing a straite watch ouer all our waies through the whole course of our life euen to the end of our daies amp not stand so much on speaking amp talking as on doing for the doer of the worke shal be blessed in his deed iam this is the thing we must looke vnto as the only ornament of our profession declaring that we haue the power of godlinesse but if deeds be wanting our religion is vaine we are like the figtree which christ cursed hauing leaues but no fruite the circumstance to be considered is the time when he refused this honour namely when he came to be a man of yeares and discretion a man in comon reason would iudge thus of moses fact moses hath rare fortune offered him he might haue bin son amp heire to a princesse surely this is a rash fact of his amp void of cosideration to refuse it vndoubtedly he far ouershot himselfe herein either through rashnesse or ignorance but to preuent such carnall surmises the spirit of god sets down this circumstance of time saying that he did not refuse it in his youth but when hee was come to age that is to perfect yeares of discretion and by reason thereof must needes haue consideration and iudgement to know what he did then did he refuse this honour to bee pharaohs daughters son and heire in the seuenth of the acts wee shall see that he was fortie yeares olde when he did this and therefore this is true which is here said that when he was come to age and staiednesse then he refused this honour for fortie yeares is a time not onely of ripenesse for strength but of staiednesse in iudgement and discretion out of this circumstance we learne two points that it is a common fault of yong years to be subiect to inconsideration and rashnes for moses did not refuse the honour of pharaohs daughter when hee was young lest it should seeme to bee a point of rashnesse but when hee was come to age as the text saith insinuating that if hee had done it when hee was young it might haue beene esteemed but a rash part and done in some hastie passion of youth euery age of man hath his faults amp this is the fault of youth to bee heady and rash in their affaires for want of consideration and experience and therefore all young persons must haue care of these sinnes of youth and watch the more against them because they are so incident to their yeares now the way to auoyde them is to follow christs example luke to labour to growe as in yeares so in wisdome and grace and to obey the counsell of paul to timothy timoth to flie the lusts of youth following after iustice faith charitie and peace with all that call vpon the name of the lord with a pure heart secondly this circumstance of time noting moses deliberate staiednesse in this fact doeth plainely aduertise vs what is or should bee the vertue of olde age and the ornament of yeares namely staiednesse amp discretion wherby i meane not only that naturall temper of affection which olde age bringeth with it but such religious discretion whereby man of yeares doe all things in faith so as their workes may be acceptable and pleasing vnto god for when a man is grown in yeares amp hath had experience amp obseruation in the church of god he must not onely haue a generall knowledge and wisdome but a particular wisdome whereby he may doe in faith whatsoeuer hee takes in hand and therein please god but alas this may be spoken of olde man in these daies that in regard of this wisdome they are very babes a thing greatly disgracefull to their condition for paul biddes the corinthians corinthian that they should not be children in vnderstanding but of ripe age yes and he forbiddes the ephesians ephesians to be children stil wauering and carried about with euery winde of doctrine whereby we may see that aged persons do quite degenerate from that they ought to bee when they are babes in knowledge voide of spirituall wisdome indeed we must grant that our aged persons are worldly wise amp hee must haue a cunning head and as wee say rise early that herein goes beyonde them but bring them to the booke of god and to giue a reason of their actions that they are done in faith herein they are meere babes and ignorant neither can they tell what it is to doe a thing in faith so as it may be acceptable to god heerein many that are yong in yeares doe quite out strippe them what would wee thinke or say of a childe that beeing set to a good schoole should still bee in the lowest forme though he had long continued at it surely wee would iudge him either exceeding negligent or destitute of ordinary capacity behold the church of god is the schoole of christ amp if a man haue liued long therein as twentie or fourtie yeares and yet be no wiser in religion than a yong child is it not a shame vnto him and shall wee not condemne him of great negligence wherefore let all aged persons here learne their duty which is to growe to ripenesse in spirituall wisdome that so their age may be to them a crowne of glory beeing found in the way of righteousnesse prou and chose rather to suffer aduersities with the people of god than to enioy the pleasures of sinne for a season the meaning of these words is this moses cast with himselfe that if hee should yield to become heire to pharaohs daughter he must liue with her and please her in all things and so altogether leaue god church and people and god holy religion which thing to doe he abhorred in his heart and withall hee must leaue and lose the eternall blessednesse of god children for the honours amp sinnefull pleasures of the court which were but momentany these things considered hee chooseth rather to bee in affliction and misery with the people of god than vpon these conditions to liue in pharaohs court amp to becom his daughters son and heire and because this may seeme a strange choice the holy ghost doth afterward render a reason hereof which is this because moses liked rather to inioy the prerogatiues of god church though it were in misery than to enioy any honour in a wicked court such as indeede pharaohs was in this verse therefore wee are to note a second fruit of moses faith to wit that hee preferred the fellowship and communion of god saints before all other societies in the world the same also was dauids practice psalm all my delight saith he is in the saints that dwell on the earth this fruite of moses faith doth discouer vnto vs a grieuous fault which raigneth in this age to wit the neglect and contempt of the communion and societie of saints there is a societie and fellowship that is loued and magnified among vs but what manner of societie is that surely of such as giue themselues to drink iesting scoffing riot mirth and gaming this is the common and generall good fellowship through which god is greatly dishonoured for most man set their delight therein and are neuer merry but in such company wherein indeede they delight themselues in their sensuality true it is man pleade that this good fellowship is a vertue but then was moses farre ouer seene for in pharaohs court he might haue had all kinde of such good fellowship and company yet hee likes it not but rather chooseth affliction and misery with the people of god then to enioy such fellowship in pharaohs court and as for the goodnesse of it it is neither so esteemed nor called by any but by them that call good euill and euill good we see moses a man of wisedome and learning acts no childe but a man of xl yeares olde hates and abhorres this good fellowship as the worst estate in the world rather chusing the societie of a miserable and persecuted church then the best of that fellowship which a kings court could yeeld let vs therefore learne more wisedome out of his practice some say this good fellowship is harmlesse and such man who thus merrily passe their times doe no such hurt as many others doe but i answere man are borne to doe good againe to misspend time wealth and wit are not these euill amp harmfull both in themselues and in the example and which is worst of all it is no fellowship with god nor any part of the communion of saints but rather a fellowship with satan therefore let all that will like true christians haue true comfort in that article of their creede the communion of saints esteeme the fellowship of good and holy man aboue all other for by this communion with god saints a man reapes great profit when as the other brings to a man the ruine both of his body and soule by the societie of the godly wee are first made partakers of their giftes and holy graces and secondly of their prayers and the blessings of god vpon them which things if there were no other might moue vs to embrace this blessed society before all other and yet further by being of this society a man auoids many of god iudgments if there had beene ten righteous man in sodome they had all beene spared from destruction wherein we may see that they that cleaue to such as feare the lord indeed neuer receiue harm by them but rather much good for for the elects sake it is that the world yet standeth and if they were gathered heauen and earth would go together but for the calling of the elect the hand of god is yet staied why then should not moses example be our rule aboue all worldly pleasure to reioice in the society of god saints thus much in generall now in the particular words are many notable points of doctrine which wee will touch in their order and chose rather ampc marke heere a rare and strange choise as euer wee shall reade of there are two things propounded to moses the first is honour and preferment in pharaohs court to be son and heire to pharahs daughter wherewith hee might haue enioyed all earthly pleasures and delights the second is the miserable afflicted condition of god church and people and of these two moses must needes choose the one well what chooseth hee surely hee refuseth the prerogatiues and dignitie that hee might haue had in pharaohs court and makes choise of the miserie and affliction of god people in aduersitie that so hee may enioy the priuiledges of god church a wonderfull choise for which his faith is heere commended and hee renowmed to all posteritie the same choise hath god set before man in all ages in former times god set before esau two things a messe of red broth and his birth right but profane esau chooseth the worser he forgoes his birth right so he may haue the broth but farre worse did the gadarens there was set before them christ iesus the lord of life and their hogges and cattell now they prefer their hogges before christ a most miserable and senselesse choice and is it not as ill with vs there is set before vs on the one side heauen and on the other side hell but man for the most part chuse hell amp forsake heauen ciuill worldly man whose delight is all in riches they prefer earth before heauen the seruice of sinne which is the greatest slauerie before the seruice of god which is perfect freedome and glorious liberty of the saints in light and thus doe all man without god speciall grace whereupon paul prayes in his epistles for the churches that god would giue vnto them the spirit of wisedome that they may be able to iudge betweene things that differ and this wisdom we must labour for that when these different things are set before vs we may make a wise choise otherwise we shew our selues to be like brute beast without vnderstanding amp do quite ouerturne our owne saluation in the ministerie of the word we haue life and death good amp euill set before vs as moses said to the people deut let vs therfore endeuour our selues to chuse life by embracing and obeying the word of god amp so shall we followe both his precept and practice to suffer aduersity with the people of god heere wee may obserue what is the ordinarie state and condition of god church and people in this world namely to be in affliction and vnder the crosse hence paul saith that we must come to heauen through manifold afflictions acts the lord knoweth what is best for his servant and children and therefore he hath set downe this for a ground that all that will liue godly in christ iesus must suffer persecution tim thus the lord dealeth with his children for speciall causes for first all crosses as losse of goods friends liberty or good name they are meanes to stirre vp and awake god people out of the slumbring fit of sinne for the godly are many times ouertaken this way the wise virgines sleepe as well as the foolish now afflictions rouze them out of the sleepe of securitie see this in iosephs brother who went on a long time without any remorse for selling their brother but when they were stayed in egypt then they are rowzed vp and can say genesis this trouble is come vpon vs for selling our brother secondly afflictions serue to humble god children leuiticus so the church of god speaketh i will beare the wrath of the lord because i haue sinned against him micah thirdly they serue to weane the people of god and to driue them from the loue of this world for if man might alwaies liue in ease they would make their heauen vpon earth which may not be and heerein god dealeth with his children like a nurse when shee will weane her childe she layes some bitter thing vpon the pappes head to make the childe to loathe the pappe so the lord to draw our hearts from the world and to cause vs to loue and seeke after heauen and heauenly things hee makes vs to taste of the bitternesse of affliction in t is worlde fourthly afflictions fer e to make god children to goe out of themselues to seeke sincerely vnto god and to relie onely vpon him which in prosperity they will not doe this paul confesseth of himselfe and others wee saith hee receiued the sentence of death in our selues because wee should not trust in our selues but in god corinthians chapter verse so good king iehosaphat when hee was compassed of his enemy hee cried to the lord and said lord wee knowe not what to doe but our eyes are towards thee chronicles chapter verse yes the rebellious iewes are heereby driuen to seeke the lord whom in prosperity they forsooke as wee may see at large psalm lastly afflictions serue to make manifest the graces of god in his children the lord saith iob knoweth my way and trieth me iob deuteronomie remember all the way saith moses to the israelites which the lord thy god ledde thee this fourtie yeares for to prooue thee and to knowe what was in thine heart hence iames calleth temptations the triall of faith iames chapter verses and paul makes patience the fruite of tribulation romanes chapter verse for looke as the showers in the spring time cause the buds to appeare so doe afflictions make manifest god graces in his children patience hope and other vertues lie close in the heart in the day of peace but when tribulation comes then they breake forth and shew themselues hence wee learne that it is not alwayes a token of god wrath to suffer affliction if any man or people be laden with crosses it is no argument that therefore they are not the children of god for as peter saith iudgements begin at god house peter chapter verse and any crosse vpon a people family or particular persons if it bring forth the fruite of grace in them is a true signe they belong to god yes when man wander from god by an euill way these afflictions are meanes to call them home to god psalme before i was afflicted i went astray and they that forsake their sinne and returne to god in the time of affliction are certainly god people for the wicked man fretteth and murmureth against god when a crosse commeth and he cannot abide it but the godly man is humbled therby and it makes him more obedient in all duties vnto god this wee should consider for by an outward profession wee beare the world in hand that we are god children and therefore wee come to heare god word and to learn how to behaue our selues as beseemeth his children but if we would be knowen to be god children indeede then when any of god iudgements doe befall vs wee must make this vse of them namely labour thereby to be humbled for our sinnes and to forsake our sinnes and to make conscience of all bad wayes for euer afterward and then wee shewe our selues to be god children indeede but if vnder the crosse or after the crosse wee be as dissolute as euer wee were and still followe our olde sinnes then wee cannot be iudged to be god people and children but rather a wicked and stubborne generation which the more they are corrected the worse they are like a stithy the more it is beaten the harder it is let vs therefore by the vse of god iudgements shewe our selues to be god children so shall wee say with dauid with much ioy and comfort it is good for vs that wee haue beene in trouble psalm thus wee see what moses chose now come wee to the thing he refused to enioy the pleasures of sinne for a season by pleasures of sinne wee must vnderstand the riches and dignitie that moses might haue had in pharaohs court and kingdome which are called the pleasures of sinne not because they were so in themselues for so they were the good giftes of god but because moses could not enioy them in pharaohs court without liuing in sinne for hee must haue refused the societie of god church and people and so haue beene a stranger from the couenant which god made with abraham isaac and iacob and with his seed after them if he would haue beene son to pharaohs daughter heere then the holy ghost setteth downe two notable reasons which induced moses to refuse these honours and dignities first because they were the pleasures of sinne and secondly because hee should enioy them but for a season the first reason affordeth vnto vs many notable points worthie our consideration here we learne that riches honour and dignity seuered from true religion are nothing but the pleasures and profites of sinne this was moses iudgement as the holy ghost here testifieth and it is the plaine truth of god as salomon after lamentable experience disputeth and proueth at large concluding of riches honour pleasures and all earthly things separated from the feare of god that they are nothing else but meere vanity and vexation of spirit and paul saith to the impure all things are impure his meate drinke and apparell which in themselues are otherwise the good giftes of god the consideration hereof is of great vse for first it lets vs see what is the state of these man which lay aside religion and good conscience and betake themselues wholly to the world to get riches and preferment most man are of this disposition and such indeede are onely counted wise for let there be speech tending to a mans commendation vsually this is the first matter of his praise that hee is a substantiall wealthy man and one that lookes well to himselfe as though riches or honour were a mans chiefe happinesse but howsoeuer the world iudgeth of these man yet hereby we may see and knowe that their case is miserable for without religion amp the feare of god their riches and honour are but the pleasures and profit of sin and therefore the more they heape vp riches after this sort not regarding christ nor his gospel the more they heape vp to themselues the treasures of sinne and consequently the greater condemnation for worldly treasures seuered from religion are but the mammon of iniquity which causeth damnation hence christ said vnto his disciples vpon occasion of the young rich man that it was as easie for a great camell to goe through the eye of a needle as for a rich man to enter into the kingdome of heauen that is such a rich man as sets his heart to get riches and honour not regarding the religion of christ whence also in another place he pronounceth this fearefull sentence against them woe be to you that are rich for you haue receiued your consolation luke they therefore that lay aside religion and giue themselues wholly to seeke gaine and honour are before god most wretched and miserable and the longer they continue in this course the more miserable they are for the more sinne they heape vp and so the deeper shall be their condemnation wherefore if any of vs haue beene thus minded heeretofore let vs now leaue this course as most dangerous to our soules for what will it profit a man to gaine the whole world if he lose his soule hence we must all learne especially they that haue any measure of wealth more or lesse to ioyne with the vse of our riches the feare of god and the practice of true religion for seuer these asunder and riches are nothing else but sinfull pleasures it is a good conscience which rectifieth the owner in the right vse of his honour amp treasures but without that he pollutes the blessings of god which he enioyes and they being polluted shal turne to his greater woe a man would haue thought that king belshazzer had beene an happy man when hee kept his royall feast amp dranke wine in golden bowles before a thousand princes that were vnder him and before his concubines but the end of that his iollity may shew vs the nature of such prosperity for so soone as he saw the fingers of a mans hand writing vpon the wall he became quite confounded in himselfe his countenance was changed and his thoughts troubled him so that the ioints of his loines were loosed and his knees smote one against the other what comfort had he now from all his riches amp pleasures so diues while he liued might seeme for his wealth and riches to be happy yet all this did him little good for hee had but his pleasure for his life time luke and after this life his soule went downe to hell a worldly man would iudge the rich man in the gospell a most happy man that saide vnto his soule by reason of his great aboundance of outward wealth luke soule soule thou hast much goods laide vp for many yeares liue at ease eate drinke and take thy fill yet because herewith he wanted religion a good conscience and the feare of god this sentence was denounced against him oh foole this night will they fetch away thy soule th n whose shall these things be wherefore vnlesse wee will wilfully cast away our owne soules let vs sanctifie our interest in all earthly blessings by a sincere endeuour in all things to shew forth the feare of god with the keeping of faith amp a good conscience and let vs begin with this as christ saith first seeke god kingdome and his righteousnesse mathew chapter verse let vs hereby seeke to haue our hearts acceptable vnto god and then all things shall be cleane vnto vs thirdly are riches and honour being seuered from true religion but the pleasures of sinne then vndoubtedly all recreations all sports and pastimes seuered from religion amp a good conscience are much more the pleasures of sin this salomon knew wel for speaking of such mirth hee calls laughter madnesse and to ioy hee saith what is it that thou doest ecclesiastes chapter verse oh then how manifolde be the sinnes of all sorts of man for who almost doth not neglect religious duties for matters of sport and pleasure wherefore if wee desire ioy indeede in any worldly things let vs first lay the foundation in our owne hearts by getting and keeping true faith and a good conscience secondly whereas moses refuseth dignitie and honour onely for this because they would bee vnto him the pleasures of sinne heere wee are taught in what manner and order wee ought to enioy worldly riches and honour moses practice heere must be our direction wee must enioy them and vse them with thankfulnesse to god so farre forth as they will further vs in the course of religion and true godlinesse but if the case stande thus that wee cannot enioy them both togethe then wee must followe moses example choose religion and a goood conscience and let honour and preferment goe this is moses practice amp we may resolue our selues that if hee might haue enioyed them together hee would haue refused neither but because he could not haue them both therefore he preferreth the religion of christ with a good conscience before the honour and wealth of egypt thirdly note this moses doth not onely refuse the riches and pleasures of egypt when they would become vnto him the pleasures of sinne but rather than hee will enioy them hee is content to suffer great miserie and aduersitie with god people where behold a singular vertue in moses hee iudgeth it too bee the greatest miserie to liue in sinne and therefore hee chooseth rather to suffer any aduersitie and reproach in this world than liue and lie in sinne because thereby hee should displease god his most louing father in christ a most notable vertue in this servant of god and the like minde beare all those that haue the same graces of sauing faith and true repentance that moses had s paul esteemed the temptations vnto sinne which satan suggested into his minde to be as beatings and buffettings and as pricks and thornes in his flesh corinthian and dauid saith psalm his eies gush out with river of water because man brake god commandements was dauid thus grieued for other mens sinnes oh then what a griefe did he suffer when he himselfe brake god commandements and thereby displeased god now looke how these servant of god were affected so must euery one of vs that professe the faith and religion of christ labour to bee affected towards sinne wee must iudge it the greatest misery and torment in the world to doe any thing that shall displease god but alas come to our daies and the case is farre otherwise for to most man it is meate and drinke vnto them to commit sinne so farre are they from counting it a misery yes if a man be ordinarily addicted to some speciall sinne you then may as soone take away his life as bereaue him of his sinne he will adventure the losse of heauen for euer for the pleasure of sinne for a time but all such are farre vnlike these holy servant of god for they counted it the greatest crosse and miserie that could be to doe any thing that displeased god and did checke and breake the peace of a good conscience and if we looke to enioy like peace and comfort with them we must striue against our owne corrupt disposition and labour to finde sinne to bee our greatest sorrow worldly miseries may affect vs but in respect of sorrow for sinne all worldly griefe should bee light vnto vs indeede wee are otherwise minded naturally but herein wee must shew the power and truth of grace that to displease god by any sinne is our greatest griefe the second reason that mooued moses to refuse the honours and pleasures of pharaohs court was because hee should haue enioyed them but for a time for the time of his naturall life was the longest that possibly hee could haue enioyed them and the same reason must moue euery one of vs to vse this world and all things herein euen all temporall benefits as though we vsed them not being alwayes willing and ready to leaue them whensoeuer god shall call this same reason doth paul render when hee perswades the corinthians to the same dutie corinthian vse this world saith hee as though you vsed it no for the fashion of this world goeth away as if he should say all things in the world last but for a time and if a man would neuer so faine he could but enioy them to the ende of his life and therfore vse them as though you vsed them not but pittie it is to see how farre man are from the practice of this dutie for they set their whole heart vpon the world and to get riches is their delight and their god this ought not so to bee god hath not laid downe these precepts and examples in vaine vndoubtedly if they draw vs not to the like practice they shal rise vp in iudgement against vs at the last day and thus much of moses choyce and refusall esteeming the rebuke of christ greater riches than the treasures of egypt for he had respect to the recompence of reward moses as we haue heard refused the honour amp wealth of egypt and chose to liue in affliction with god people now because this might seeme to bee a strange choyce and a naturall man would soone condemne him of folly for his labour therefore here the holy ghost laies downe a reason that mooued moses thus to doe to wit moses chose rather to suffer affliction with god people than to enioy the pleasures and honours of egypt because he was perswaded that reproach for christ his sake was greater riches than all the wealth in egypt so that he refused not absolutely riches honour and other comforts but chose the best riches and honour and left the worser vpon a sound iudgement betweene things that did differ hereby wee may obserue in generall how needfull a thing it is for euery christian to haue sound knowledge amp vnderstanding in the word of god for he that would walke vprightly and approoued of god must be able to iudge betweene things that differ not onely betweene good and euill but betweene good and good which is the better and so of euils which is the worser which no man can doe but he that hath a sound and right iudgement in the word of god for therein is attained the spirit of discerning many there be that by the course of their liues choose hell and refuse heauen which vndoubtedly comes from their ignorance in the word but ignorace wil excuse none he that will come to heauen must be able to discerne good from euill and accordingly to choose the good and to refuse that which is euill which without diuine and supernaturall knowledge no man can doe and therefore all ignorant persons and all such as are blinded through the deceitfulnesse of sinne must shake off their securitie and get sound knowledge in scripture with a good conscience that when things which doe differ are set before the they may with moses choose the better but let vs come to moses iudgement more particularly hee esteemed the rebuke of christ ampc that is hee was firmely resolued that reproach and contempt for christ his sake was greater riches vnto him than the treasures of a whole kingdom but some will say this is a very strange iudgement can it possibly be true and good ans yes vndoubtedly it is most sound iudgement and worthy eternall remembrance of euery one of vs that to suffer reproach for christ his sake is greater riches than all worldly wealth the truth hereof is proued by many reasons out of god word god hath made a promise of blessednes to those which suffer for christs sake blessed are you saith christ when man reuile you and speake all manner of euill sayings against you for my names sake ampc and s peter saith if yee bee railed vpon for my names sake blessed are ye and lest any should doubt how this can be christ shewes wherein this blessednesse consists saying he that forsaketh houses or brother or sisters or father or mother or wife or childre or lands for my names sake shall receiue an hundred fold more and shall inherit eternall life a most worthy promise assuring vs that no man loseth by suffering for christs sake for hee shall be rewarded an hundred fold ouer in stead of earthly friends and worldly comforts he shal haue the loue and fauour of god shed abroad in his heart which will bee an ouer flowing fountaine of comfort for soule and body for euer farre more worth than the wealth and treasures of all the kingdomes in the world a smal springing fountaine we know is better to an house than a hundred cisternes full because of continuall supply from the springing fountaine when the cisterns will be spent behold the loue of god in christ with other spiritual graces shall be in all that suffer for the name of christ as liuing streames flowing vnto life eternall when as the cisterns of all worldly pleasures and treasures shal be spent and dried vp by suffering afflictio for christs sake wee are made conformable vnto him in his humilitie that so we may bee made like vnto him after this life in glory so paul saith our light affliction causeth vnto vs an eternall weight of glory corinthian and againe it is a true saying if we be dead with christ we shall also liue with him if we suffer we shall also raigne with him tim this assurance can no worldly riches giue and therefore wee may boldly say that the suffering of reproach for christ his sake is greater riches than the treasures of a whole kingdome to suffer for christ his sake is a token of god speciall loue and therefore s paul biddes the philippians not to feare their aduersaries which is a token of saluation vnto them and that of god because it is giuen to you saith he for christ that you should not onely beleeue but suffer for his sake wherfore if suffering for christ haue a promise of blessednes if it make vs conformable vnto christ amp be a signe of god special loue then is it to be esteemed aboue the riches and honours of the whole world are afflictios for christ to be esteemed aboue the treasures of a kingdome then we must all learne to reioyce in the troubles and wrongs which we suffer for christs sake so did the apostles act they departed from the councell reioycing in that they were counted worthy to suffer affliction for his name and s paul brags hereof greatly saying i beare in my body the marks of the lord iesus gal and looke as these servant of god reioyced in their sufferings for christ so likewise must we labour for the same heart and affections in the like case for who would not reioyce to be made partaker and possessor of the treasures of a kingdome well the rebuke of christ is greater riches than the treasures of a kingdome this lesson is of great vse for howsoeuer many among vs come to heare god word yet there be many also that scoffe and mocke at religion and at the gospel of christ and the professors thereof whereby the most are hindred in profession and many daunted and quite driuen backe but wee must here learne not to bee discouraged by these mockes indeede we must take heed we giue them no iust occasion to mocke vs and then if we be scoffed at we shal neuer be hurt by it nay though that be farre from their intent yet in mocking vs they doe vs great honour for the word of god that cannot lie is this that to suffer affliction for christ his sake is greater honour and riches than the treasures of a kingdome and if moses his iudgement be good which god himselfe doth here commend then we are happy and blessed in enduring these mockes and scoffes for christ secondly wee must here learne instruction for the time to come we haue for a long time through the great goodnesse of god enioyed peace and wealth with the gospel of christ but vndoubtedly these daies of peace will haue an ende they cannot last alwaies god people must passe through the fierie furnace of affliction well when this is come vpon vs how shall wee be able to beare it surely we must now learne to be of this opinion that moses was of we must iudge it to bee the greatest honour and riches that can be to suffer affliction for christ his sake and this will be the ground of all constancy courage and christian boldnesse in the day of trial for he that is of this mind wil neuer feare affliction nor reproach for christ his sake nay he will be so farre from fearing it that he will reioyce and triumph therein further whereas it is said esteeming the rebuke of christ here marke the rebuke of god church and people is called the rebuke of christ the people of god in egypt were laden with reproaches and rebukes and behold christ accounts it his rebuke and the holy ghost so calls it where learne this that christ esteemeth the reproach and affliction of his church as his owne affliction when saul went to persecute the brother at damascus act christ iesus calls to him from heauen saying saul saul why persecutest thou me saul went to persecute the christians and yet our sauiour christ taketh it vnto himselfe and after his conuersion he saith corinthian euery way wee beare about in our body the dying of the lord iesus and againe let no man put me to businesse for i beare in my body the markes of the lord iesus gal this is a point of speciall vse first hence we learne that christ hath a speciall care of his church and children in that he iudgeth their afflictions to be his owne afflictions and therefore he can no more forget or leaue off to helpe them in distresse than deny himselfe secondly here is a speciall comfort for god children that be in affliction their afflictions are not their owne alone but christs also he is their partner and fellow sufferer this may seeme strange but it is most true christ puts as it were his shoulders vnder our afflictions and takes them to himselfe as though they were his owne than which what can be more comfortable for though thou thy selfe cannot beare it yet trust vndoubtedly that christ who beares with thee wil giue thee strength to vndergoe it vnto victory thirdly if the afflictions of a christian bee the afflictions of christ then it is a fearefull sinne for any man to mocke or reproach his brother in regard of his profession and religion for mocking is persecution gal with gen and that reproach which is cast vpon a christian is cast vpon christ and christ takes it as done vnto himselfe the persecutor wounds christ iesus through the sides of a poore christian which is a feareful thing for in so doing he sets himselfe against the lord iesus he kickes against the prickes and if he so continue hee must needes looke for some fearefull ende for who hath euer beene fierce against the lord and hath prospered iob wherefore if any of vs be guiltie of any sinne in this kind let vs repent for vnlesse wee turne our condemnation will be remedilesse againe the afflictions of the israelites are here said to be their sufferings for christ where note that though christ his comming were then afarre off yet the israelites then knewe of christ for else they could not suffer for him this confuteth those which holde that euery man may be saued by his owne religion whatsoeuer it be if hee liue ciuilly and vprightly therein their reason is taken from the iewes who they say had onely the knowledge of outward ceremonies and so were saued but that opinion is here disprooued for the iewes knew christ and professed him or else they would neuer suffer for him and therefore they were saued by him and not by their obedience to outward ceremonies and thus much of the reason which mooued moses to make such a choyce as hee did now in the ende of the verse is added a reason why moses was of this strange iudgement to think the reproach of christ greater riches than the treasures of egypt namely because he had respect to the recompence of reward that is he often set his eie to behold and his heart to consider how god had made a promise of life euerlasting after this life vnto all those that obeyed him and trusted in him in this life for the enioying whereof hee preferred that estate wherein he might liue in the feare of god though it were a state of reproach before all other whatsoeuer where wee see what it is that will bring a man to esteeme affliction with the feare of god better than the treasures amp pleasures of an earthly kingdome namely as we set the bodily eie to behold the affliction so we must lift vp the eye of the minde of faith to behold the recompence of reward that is the state of glory in heauen prepared for god children thus did the christian hebrewes in the primitiue church hebrewes they suffered with ioy the spoiling of their goods a very hard thing but yet most true for it is the word of god and the reason is rendred they knew in themselues how that they had in heauen a better and more enduring substance and our sauiour christ endured the crosse and despised the shame for the ioy that was set before him hebrewes that is in consideration of that ioy in glory whereto hee should be aduanced himselfe and bring all his members this we must make vse of for if wee will liue godly in christ iesus wee must suffer affliction this flesh and bloud will not yeeld vnto and therefore to perswade vs to suffer with ioy we must with moses haue respect to the recompence of reward wee must say thus to our soules the day will come wherein wee shall haue euerlasting life in the kingdome of heauen if wee now serue and feare him shall wee not then for his sake be content to suffer a short affliction seeing the greatest of them are not woorthie of the glorie that shall bee reuealed romanes chapter verse question but why doth the holy ghost call euerlasting life a reward answere it is not so called because moses did procure it and deserue it at god hand by the dignitie of his workes in suffering for sure no man can merit any thing at god hands the case is plaine for christ as hee is man consider his manhoode a part from his godhead could not merit any thing at god hands for he that would merit of god by any worke must doe three things he must doe the worke of himselfe and by himselfe for if hee doe it by another the other meriteth and must haue the reward and praise of the worke secondly hee must doe it of meere good will and not of dutie for that which is of duty cannot merit because a man is bound to doe it the worke done to merit must be of that price and dignity that it may be proportionable to life euerlasting which is the reward now though christ as he is man be aboue all man amp all angels in grace and dignity yet consider his manhoode a part from his godhead and hee could not doe a worke with these three properties for first the workes done of the manhoode were not done of it selfe but from that fulnesse of the spirit wherewith hee was endued secondly christ as man is a creature and so considered his workes are of duty to the creator and so cannot merit thirdly christs workes as man simply considered are finite and so could not merit infinite glory question how then did christ merit at god hands answere partly by meanes of god promise made in the law which was this doe this and thou shalt liue but properly and chiefely because hee was not a meere man onely but withall true and very god for because his obedience both in his life and death though performed in his manhoode was the obedience of him that was god and man euen from the infinite excellencie of the person whose it is it becomes meritorious in his manhood hee obayed the law and suffered for our sinnes but the dignity thereof came from his godhead for hee that did these workes for vs was both god and man now if christ considered as man onely cannot merit then much lesse can any other man merite at god hands and therefore moses though hee were a worthy man yet because hee was but a man and a sinnefull man also he could not by any worke deserue life euerlasting at god hands but life euerlasting is called a reward in the scripture because it is the free gift of god promised by god to his children in christ for this end to allure and drawe them on in obedience and it must not seeme strange that wee say a reward is a free gift for so it may be as we shall see by comparing two places of scripture together to wit matthew with luke for whereas mathew saith if you loue them that loue you what reward haue you saint luke repeating the same thing saith what thanke haue you or as the word signifies what fauour or free gift haue you secondly there may be another cause rendred why life euerlasting is called a reward to wit not in regard of the worke done but in regard of the worker considered in christ for christes merit makes life euerlasting to be a reward now euery true beleeuer that endeuours to doe the will of god is in christ and so christes righteousnesse with the merit thereof is his so farre forth as serues to make his person acceptable to god whereupon hee hath a promise of reward made vnto him vpon his obedience yet not for his worke but for the worke of christes obedience in whom he is and so must these words here be vnderstood the consideration of this reward of life eternall giuen through christ to those that suffer for his sake may make vs ioyfull and patient in all our afflictions for righteousnesse sake a naturall man will endure much for a good recompence in the end now christ saith great is your reward and therefore let vs reioice in suffering for christ holding fast our confidence which hath so great recompence of reward heb secondly is life euerlasting a recompence that is a giuing of a reward then heere is condemned the desperate practice of many a one who spend their whole life in a greedie pursuite after the profites and pleasures of the worlde as it were running themselues out of breath in the way to hell without all regarde of their soules till death come thinking that if at the last gaspe they can crie god mercie and commend their soules to god all is well but all such persons for the most part deceiue their owne soules not considering that life euerlasting is giuen as a reward now wee knowe that no reward is giuen to any man till the worke be done which hee is set about he must come worke in the vineyard some part of the day that would haue his pennie at night as for those that neither stirre hand nor foote to doe the worke what reward can they looke for and yet this is the state of carnall liuers they addict themselues wholly to earthly things but if wee looke for any reward at the day of death wee must labour in the workes of godlinesse all the dayes of our life for therefore were wee redeemed luke in the whole booke of god wee finde but one man that liued wickedly and repented at his end that is the thiefe vpon the crosse which shewes that it is a most rare thing for a man to haue the reward of life euerlasting after this life that labours not in the workes of godlinesse in this life thirdly the consideration of this reward must stirre vp all god children vnto all diligence in the duties of godlinesse amp that with cheerefulnesse through the whole course of their liues when wee shall die wee will looke earnestly for this reward and therefore while we liue we must diligently doe the workes that god commaundeth and then when death comes we may assure our selues that god will giue vs this reward not because wee did deserue it by our works but because he hath promised it in christ vpon our endeuour in obedience and true repentance and thus much for the reason of moses choise by faith he forsooke egypt and feared not the fiercenesse of the king for he was couragious as hee that saw him that is inuisible in this verse the spirit of god proceedeth to another example of moses faith and heereto also in the verse following hee addeth a third now hee is thus large in the commendation of his faith for this end to perswade the hebrewes to whom this epistle is sent that they were not to looke for any iustification by the workes of the law and his reason is because if any man could be iustified by the workes of the law it must be moses who gaue the law to the people from the lord and did excell in obedience to both tables and therefore is a renowmed prophet vnto all posterity in speciall fauour with god numb but moses could not be iustified by the works of the law for here the holy ghost proues that moses was iustified amp saued by faith the thing that comends moses and makes him stand before god is not his works but his faith and therefore the conclusion is that as moses was not iustified by his works but by faith no more must they stand vpon their works to be iustified therby but labour for such faith as moses had now this faith of moses is a true sauing faith founded on these two promises of god on this great amp maine promise made to abraham i will be thy god and the god of thy seed on another particular promise rising from the general made vnto him when he was called to fetch the israelites out of bondage which was this i will be with thee and guide thee and in this place moses is said to haue faith not onely because he beleeued that god would be his god as hee was the god of all abrahams seed but because he beleeued particularly that god would be his god amp defend and be with him in the deliuerance of the israelites out of egypt to come particularly to this fact by faith moses forsooke egypt moses departed from egypt twise first when hee had slaine the egyptian and fled from pharaoh vnto midian and there kept iethroes sheepe secondly fourty yeares after when hee led the people of israell out of egypt into the land of canaan and heere some make it a question whether of these departures is meant in this place answere it is most like that this place is to be vnderstoode of his second departure rather than of the first and the reason is taken out of exodus chapter the second verses where wee finde that the first time he fled for feare for so soone as he heard that his slaughter of the egyptian was knowen to pharaoh he fled in such feare as that hee durst not returne againe of yeares now these words are not to be vnderstoode of such a flight for here it is said hee departed not fearing the kings wrath or fiercenesse here some will say this is no commendation for malefactors and rebels doe flie their country answer they flie indeede yet not in faith but in feare moses fled in faith and hereby his faith is commended that hee fled not fearing the king but malefactors flie for feare of due punishment moses departed with courage and boldnesse and therfore fled not as a malefactor for he feared not the king as appeareth plainely in the history for though pharaoh had said vnto him exod get thee gone see thou see my face no more for when thou commest in my sight thou shalt die yet moses went once more namely the tenth time and tolde him of the tenth plague and saide that pharaohs servant should come downe vnto him and fall downe and pray him to get him out with the people and their cattell and when the israelites murmured against him at the red sea when pharaoh was at their heeles and they had no way to flie moses encourageth the people saying feare not stand still and behold the saluation of the lord which he wil shew you this day for the egyptians whom ye haue seene this day shall ye neuer see againe exod whereby it notably appeares that moses departed in faith without feare of pharaoh but some wil say for a man to come into another mans kingdome and to carie away his subiects without the kings consent is a fact of rebellion and sedition and therfore worthy no commendation but rather shame and punishment and this did moses he comes from midian and caries away the iewes which had beene a long time pharaohs subiects and for whose seruice hee might pleade possession and a long prescription therefore it seemes to be no fact of faith answere indeede if moses had done this on his owne head he might worthily haue beene thus censured but when hee came to egypt hee had a calling immediatly from god to doe as he did and for confirmation hereof he had god promise of assistance in working strange miracles and when he caried the people out of egypt he did it by commaundement from a king that was higher then pharaoh neither yet did moses carie them away as a priuate man for he was a publike person an high magistrate and no stranger but one of themselues yes he was a king as may appeare in god word for deut he is plainly called a king and gen it is said there were so many kings in edom before there raigned any king ouer the children of israell now the last of those kings raigned at that time when moses went with the israelites out of egypt so that moses was their king amp had the aucthority and gouernment of a king ouer them from the lord and therefore it was no fact of rebellion in him but a work that did greatly commend his faith being grounded vpon god commaundement and promise thus we see how we must conceiue of moses fact now wee come to some particular points to bee considered therein how came it to passe that moses now had this courage to depart from pharaoh not fearing his commaundement whereas yeares before being called to shew himselfe vnto his brother as one whom they were to respect as their deliuerer acts hee fled immediatly out of egypt vpon the notice of one fact of defence in behalf of the israelites why did he not shew as much courage when hee slew the egyptian as at his second departure answer the cause of his courage at this later time was this god now renued his commission and confirmed his former calling for when hee was first called hee did his duty and reuenged their wrongs but yet being in danger and his calling being as yet but a secret instinct he was fearefull and fled but now when god called him the second time and confirmed the same calling both by promise and commaundement and power to worke miracles then fearefull moses becomes couragious and bold here then obserue that there is a difference of god graces there is a first grace and a second grace the first is that which god giues to any man for any calling the second is that which god adds to the first for the confirming thereof and the first is not effectuall without the second as heere we see moses first calling was not effectuall with him till the second came and so god first grace is not effectuall till the second come by which the former is confirmed strengthened and encreased and the second is confirmed by the third and so we must goe on from grace to grace if wee will be bold and couragious in any duty either of our general or particular calling this must be well considered for that any man stands in grace or encreaseth therein either respecting his particular calling or his christian conuersation it comes from this that god adds a second grace vnto the first and therefore whosoeuer is enabled for any duty hath great cause to praise god for whether we continue in grace or encrease therin it comes from the goodnesse of god who addeth grace to grace which if he should not do we shold fall away amp not be able to go forward in the feare of god and the duties of our calling for the first grace would not suffice to strengthen vs against temptation and therefore howsoeuer god hath strengthened vs for the time past yet still we must pray to god to deliuer vs from euill which plainly imports that our standing is from his daily supply of new grace point when went moses out of egypt the time is directly set down exod euen the selfe same day when the promise of god was expired for when the foure hundred and thirty yeares were expired then went all the hoast of the lord out of egypt neither before nor after but the very same day indeed moses was chosen to be their captaine yeares before and sent vnto them by god and s stephen saith hee thought they would haue vnderstood so much but then they would not take him for their guide yet now yeares after when god determinate time of yeares was expired he comes againe vnto the to carry them out of egypt amp then they acknowledge him amp follow him out according to god commission hence we learne first that no creature can alter the rule of god prouidence fourty yeares before moses would haue deliuered the people but he must stay till the time of the lord promise was accomplished and then he carries them all away secondly this must teach vs not onely to beleeue that god both can amp will keep his promises but also by faith to waite for the time wherein he will accomplish the same vnto vs moses is faine to waite years for the fulfilling of god promise when daniel vnderstoode how long the israelites must be in captiuity he would not pray for the shortning of that time but when he knew that the time of their return drew neere then he praied vnto the lord most earnestly waiting for the accomplishment of god promise in their deliuerace and dauid thus waited on god for deliuerace in all his troubles and their examples must we follow for the fruition of all god blessings point in what manner doth moses depart the text saith he went out not fearing the kings commandement so that his departure was with courage whence wee learne sundry instructios first here is a notable president for the framing of our liues which must be a rule vnto vs we must walke diligently in our callings as moses did and though crosses meete vs so that pharaoh fall out with vs if kings become our enemy yet we must not lay aside the duties of our callings but after moses example goe on therein with courage moses without fearing the kings wrath went amp led all the people away and so must euery one of vs doe although dangers come wee must not feare but stand fast in our profession and goe on in the duties of our calling ecclesiastes if the spirit of him that ruleth rise vp against thee leaue not thy place secondly hence we may learne that magistrates which are to gouerne the people ought to bee man of courage in performing the duties of their calling when too heauie a burden lay on moses in iudging all the congregation himselfe iethro his father in law bids him prouide among all the people man of courage fearing god to be rulers exod now their courage must not bee a prowd hautinesse or an indiscreete crueltie but a godly boldnesse which may inable them to the duties of their calling without feare of man to this ende the lord put of his spirit vpon the seuentie which were to rule with moses numb now the spirit of god is not a spirit of feare but of power and of loue amp of a sound minde tim which shewes that in a magistrate must be courage to call and if neede bee to compell others to the duties of their calling how great soeuer they be and it is a matter of great waight amp moment in god church for the minister may teach and speake as much as hee will or can yet vnlesse with the sword of the spirit there bee ioyned the temporall sword of the magistrate to reforme mens liues and to keep them from open sinne against the law of god and to vrge them to the duties which the minister teacheth surely their teaching and preaching will be to small effect lastly moses went with courage out of egypt this departure of his was a signe of our spiritual departing out of the kingdome of darknesse for so paul applieth it corinthian and therfore after moses example we must with courage come euery day more and more out of the kingdome of darknesse marching forward with couragious faith and heauenly boldnesse toward our blessed canaan the glory of heauen wee must not leaue this to the last breath and then thinke to haue heauen gates ready open for vs but we must enter into god kingdom in this life looke as moses by his faith did depart boldly out of egypt so must wee in heart by faith depart out of the kingdome of sinne this we shall doe when we vse meanes to establish the kingdome of christ iesus in our hearts and doe forsake the workes of sinne and darknesse for looke where there is no departing from sinne there is no faith and therefore let vs shew our selues to haue true faith by departing more and more boldly and ioyfully out of the kingdome of sinne and satan that so it may appeare wee loue the light and hate darknesse and in this iourney let vs not feare any contrary commaundement nor the furious wrath of spirituall pharaoh the diuell nor all the gates of hell for christ iesus is our guide because a man might thinke at the first that it was a rash and desperate part in moses thus boldly to take away the israelites not regarding pharaohs commandement therfore in the later part of the verse the holy ghost setteth downe a reason that mooued moses to doe so in these words for he endured or was couragious that is hee tooke heart to himselfe why so because he saw god that is inuisible that is he cast the eie of faith vpo god who had promised the euidence of his power and presence in their deliuerance so that it was the worke of moses faith laying hold on the promise of god presence and protection from the rage of pharaoh that made him thus confident and bold hence wee learne that the true valour and manhood that was in moses and is in all god children like vnto him is a gift of grace among many gifts of the spirit powred vpon our sauiour christ the spirit of strength or courage is one isay and iethroes counsell to moses is notable this way he biddes him prouide for gouernours man of courage fearing god exod insinuating that true courage is alwaies ioyned with the feare of god and is a fruite of grace but some will say that many heathen man who neuer knewe the true god nor what the gifts of the spirit meant had that courage answer true it is they had courage indeed but it was nothing but a carnall boldnesse not worthy the name of courage beeing onely a shaddow of true fortitude arising from ambition pride and other fleshly humour whereas moses his courage sprang from the grace of faith in the merciful promises of god made vnto him concerning his deliuerance amp safetie and indeede howsoeuer wicked man haue a notable shewe of diverse vertues yet in the triall they prooue but shaddowes for true valour and other vertues doe alwaies accompany regeneration here is the cause that made moses thus couragious and this will make any man bold if hee can be perswaded in his conscience of god speciall presence with him and of his prouidence and protection ouer him here then obserue a singular fruite of faith it makes god who is indeed inuisible to be after a sort visible vnto vs moses by faith sawe him that is inuisible for by faith he was perswaded of god prouidence and speciall protection in the deliuerie of his people though pharaoh should rage neuer so much so enoch is said to haue walked with god because hee sawe him by the eie of faith in all his affaires and when ioseph was allured to sin with his mistres what staied him surely the feare of god whom he saw by faith how can i doe this great wickednes saith ioseph amp so sin against god as if he should say i am alwaies where god is present how then should i doe so wickedly amp god see it and the same is the state of all true beleeuers their faith makes the inuisible god to be after a sort visible vnto the so as a faithfull man may say god is present with me and protecteth me whereby we may see what little faith is in the world for few can truly say they see god which faith inables a man to do yes most man care so litle to see god that he is farre from their very thoghts many haue made meanes to see the diuell but where is hee that labours for such a measure of faith that he may see the inuisible god if wicked man run to coniurers to see the diuell whom they shall once see to their sorrowe let vs labour for faith in the word and sacraments and this faith will make vs so to indure in all tribulation as though we sawe god furthermore seeing moses by faith endured as hee that saw god we learne that the seeing of god by faith takes away feare and giues spirituall boldnesse this is a point of speciall vse for naturally man are feareful some cannot endure the darke nor solitary places for feare of the diuel yes the shaking of a leaf or the crawling of a worme doth terrifie others now howsoeuer some mens constitution may help forward this feare yet many times it comes from an accusing conscience as a fruit of sinne and the way to remooue it is here to be learned namely to doe as moses did that is labour to bee resolued of god presence with vs and prouidence ouer vs and this wil arme vs against al satanicall and foolish feare for if god be on our side who can be against vs to do vs harme againe the souldier by his place and calling ought to be a man of courage for els the state of his life and the thought of his enemy will much affright him now how may he become courageous they vse to sound the drumme and trumpet for this ende and it must be granted they be good incitements amp prouocations vnto battell but when it comes to the point of danger these cannot giue heart others vse against the battell to fill themselues with wine and to make theselues valiant by strong drinke this indeede may make them senselesse and so desperate but the true way is to become christian souldiers knowing and fearing god and with their bodily armour to bring also the shield of faith wherby their hearts may be assured that god hath called them to that fight amp that he is present with them to couer their heads in the day of battell this will make them to take heart and courage to themselues and to become truly valorous though by nature they be weake and timorous thirdly who knows whether god will bring vs to this triall either to lay down our liues or forsake his truth for he may iustly take from vs these golden daies of peace for our ingratitude now if such times come vpon vs what shall we doe shall wee denie the faith of christ god forbid but how shall we stand out in such a triall surely we must follow moses and labour to see him that is inuisible by faith this will make vs couragious and without feare in god cause remebring this also that among those which are reckoned to goe downe to hell the fearefull man is one revelation who dares not stand to the truth of god but for feare of man denies it let vs therefore now begin to settle our hearts in the assurance of god prouidence and protection that so when triall comes wee may be bold in the case of god him that is inuisible that is god who is a most simple essence voyd of all composition or corporall substance for god is a spirit john and therefore inuisible and not subiect to mans senses but some will say god is said to haue head heart hands and feete with other parts of mans body and therefore he is visible answer the holy ghost so speaketh in scripture of god by way of resemblance of him vnto man that we might the better thereby conceiue of his works for therefore are the parts of mans body ascribed vnto god in scripture that we might know he doth such workes by his diuine power as man doth by the parts of his body man sheweth his strength and valour in his arme and by resemblance vnto man god is said to haue an arme to note out his power and valiant actes and so god is said to haue eies because wee should conceiue that by his infinite wisdome he seeth all things more cleerely than man doth any thing at noone day with his bodily eies and so of the rest but moses is said to talke with god face to face and to see his backe parts exod answer this imports not that he saw the substance of god but onely that god did after a familiar manner reueale himselfe vnto him and in some resemblance shewe him his glory so farre forth as moses was able to behold it for the text is plaine my face can not be seene there shall no man see me and liue verse here wee learne that when wee pray to god wee must not conceiue of him by any forme or image in our minds for so we make an idoll of god quest what then must we doe for how will some say can i pray to him and not thinke of him answer when wee thinke of god or pray vnto him wee must conceiue of him in our mindes as hee hath reuealed himselfe in scripture that is by his workes and by his properties wee must thinke in our mindes of an eternall essence most holy wise ampc who made all things and gouernes them by his mighty power for euery image to resemble god by either to the minde or to the eie is a plaine lie making him visible who is inuisible as saith the prophet hab the image what profiteth it for it is a teacher of lies which flatly ouerthroweth the opinion and practice of the roman church who resemble the true god euen god the father and the holy trinitie in images what else doe they herein but make a lie of god but the papists say they deuise no image to resemble god in but onely such whereby hee hath shewed himselfe as the scripture testifies as the father like an old man the son as he was incarnate and the holy ghost like a doue math answer wee must not conceiue of those formes of an old man or of a doue to haue beene euer any images of the father or of the holy ghost but onely signes and pledges for a time whereby those persons did then manifest their presence now there beeing an expresse commandement against all representation of god by images not excepting those very shapes whereby it pleased god for a time to signifie his presence it must needes be idolatrous presumption to make any image of god or of the trinitie and indeed god being inuisible as the text saith it is impossible to make any true image or resemblance of him by faith hee ordained the passeouer and the effusion of blood lest hee that destroyed the first borne should touch them in the former verses the author of this epistle hath shewed vnto vs the notable faith of moses by two worthy acts his refusing to be called the son of pharaohs daughter his departing out of egypt now here in this verse he commends his faith vnto vs by a third action which is the ordination or celebrating of the passeouer this verse is the summe of the chapter of exodus the effect whereof is this after that god had sent nine seuerall plagues vpon the land of egypt which were occasions to harden pharaohs heart at last he sends moses to certifie pharaoh that vnlesse he would let the people go he would send a tenth plague which should bee more grieuous to them than all the former euen the slaughter of all the first borne in egypt both of man and beast yet pharaohs heart was not softened neither did he let the people goe therefore moses departeth from him and according to god commandement assembles the elders of israel together and causeth them to kill euery man a lambe of a yeare olde amp to eate it roste with fire and to take the blood and sprinkle it vpon the doore cheekes and vpon the postes of their houses for a signe vnto them that the angel of the lord seeing the blood sprinkled vpon their doores should passe ouer them and touch none of their first borne neither man nor beast this is the summe and meaning of that history now let vs come to the consideration of this fact more particularly and first to the meaning of the wordes of this verse because there is some difficultie in them the passe ouer here named may be thus described it is one of the sacraments of the olde testament seruing for a signe to the people of israell both of their temporall deliuerance from the bondage of egypt and from the slaughter of the first borne and also of their spirituall deliuerance from euerlasting death by the sacrifice of christ iesus the immaculate lambe of god touching this description first i call it one of the sacraments of the old test because they had beside this circumcision another ordinary sacrament next i say it serued for a signe to the people of israel to shew that it was properly a sacrament vnto them for it is of the nature of a sacrament to signifie amp seale vp some blessing of god to his people now that the passe ouer did so is plaine where the lord calls it a signe or token of deliuerance vnto them but som will say this passe ouer was a sacrifice for so it is called this is the sacrifice of the lord passe ouer and thou shalt not offer the bloud of my sacrifice with leauened bread ampc ans it is called a sacrifice because it was killed also the bloud thereof was sprinkled amp som parts of it as the fat with the two kidneies were burnt in sacrifice to the lord for when iosias kept that famous passe ouer with all the people the priests that slew the passe ouer and sprinkled the bloud thereof did first take away that which was to be consumed with fire and then gaue to the people according to the diuisions of their families as moses appointed now in regard of these properties of a sacrifice which were in the passe ouer it is truly called a sacrifice and yet more properly it was a sacrament because it was a visible signe of speciall blessings from the lord but what did this sacrament of the passe ouer signifie answer it did signifie a double deliuerance one temporall as well from the destroying angell as also from the bondage of egypt the other spirituall from the curse of the law and from the wrath of god the first is plaine where the lord saith the bloud being sprinkled vpon the doore posts shall be a token for you that i will passe ouer you and verse ye shall keepe the feast of vnleauened bread for that same day will i bring your armies out of the land of egypt and touching the second that it was a signe of a more heauenly deliuerance from the bondage of sinne amp satan paul telleth vs plainely when as hee saith christ our passe ouer is sacrificed for vs giuing vs to vnderstand that the paschall lambe in the olde testament was vndoubtedly a true signe of the true paschall lambe christ iesus to which purpose john baptist saith behold the lamb of god that taketh away the sinnes of the world john where he calleth christ the lambe of god making there an opposition betweene him and the paschall lamb of moses which may be called the paschall lambe of man for herein also they differ the paschall lambe was separated by man though by god appointment but christ the true lambe of god was set a part before all worlds by god the father and thus wee see briefly what this passe ouer is it followeth ordained the passe ouer the word translated ordained signifieth he made or did celebrate for the better vnderstanding whereof wee must haue recourse to the euangelists matthew setteth downe christs speach to his disciples about the passe ouer which he kept with them a little before his passion thus my time is come i will make my passe ouer at thine house now s luke repeating the same storie mentioneth first the killing and then the eating of it by which two words he explaneth what christ meant by making which here is translated ordaining the passe ouer to wit first the killing amp preparing of the paschall lamb and then the eating of it as the lord sacrament but this is a strange kind of speach wil som say how can the passe ouer be killed or eaten seeing properly the passe ouer is nothing else but the act of the angell passing ouer the houses of the israelites when he smote the first borne in euery house of the egyptians ans the phrase is improper yet it must not seeme strange because it is vsuall in scripture entreating of the sacraments sometime to giue the name of the signe to the thing signified as corinthian christ is called our passe ouer and on the other side to giue the name of the thing signified to the signe as in this place he ordained the passe ouer that is the paschall lambe which was a sign of the angels passing ouer their houses so this is my body that is a sign of my body the rock was christ the reason of these figuratiue speeches whereby one thing is put for another is the sacramentall vnion of the signe with the thing signified which yet is not naturall according to place either by change of the signe into the thing signified or by including the thing signified in the sign or fastning it vpo it but respectiue amp analogicall by reason of that agreement amp proportion which is betweene the signe amp the thing signified which stands in this that look when the outward signe is presented to the outward senses at the very same time the thing signified is thereby as by certaine visible words presented to the mind and indeede looke what coniunction is between words amp the things spoken of in the mind of the vnderstanding hearer the same is betweene sacramentall signes and the things signified in the mind of a discerning receiuer but when words of sense are spoken to the eare the vnderstanding mind doth therwith apprehend the thing spoken of and euen so the minde of the discerning receiuer doth inwardly apprehed the thing signified and apply it to his soule when the sacramentall sign is presented to the outward sense and this coiunction ariseth not from the nature either of the signe or the thing signified but fro the institution of the lord the meaning then of the holy ghost here is this that moses by faith did ordaine and appoint the killing and eating of the paschall lamb which was the sign of the passing ouer of the lord angell when the first borne in egypt were slaine it followeth and effusion of bloud that is the sprinkling of the bloud of the paschal lamb which was a notable rite amp ceremony vsed in this first passe ouer after this maner the bloud of euery lamb was put into a bason amp sprinkled with a bunch of hysope vpon the doore posts of euery mans house among the iewes now this rite did not continue alwaies but was peculiar amp proper to this first passe ouer kept in egypt at the institution thereof being then practiced but not after in regard of that speciall deliuerance then at hand wherof it was an assurance for it signified vnto them that the angel of the lord coming to destroy y e first born of egypt amp seeing that bloud so sprinked should passe ouer their houses and touch none of their first borne of man nor beast this end of the sprinkling of this bloud is here likewise set down in these words lest he that destroyed the first born shold touch them he that is the angell of the lord who was sent to destroy the first born throughout all egypt both of man and beast saue onely of those who had their door posts sprinkled with bloud and thus much for the meaning of the words first obserue what the h ghost saith of this fact of moses in ordaining the passe ouer namely that he did it by faith hence we learne that the sacraments of the new testament must be celebrated in faith for herein we are to seek to be acceptable to god as moses was the l supper in the new testament succeedeth the passe ouer in the olde for that was a signe to the jew that iesus christ the immaculate lamb of god should afterward be sacrificed for their sinnes and this is to vs a signe of christ already sacrificed now look as that was ordained amp receiued vnder y e law so must this be administred amp receiued vnder the gospell but in the olde testament moses celebrates the passe ouer through faith amp enioines the israelites so to doe therefore accordingly must wee by faith celebrate and receiue the lord supper vnder the gospel cains sacrifice was fruitlesse to him and odious to god because he offered not in faith amp no lesse were all other faithlesse sacrifices euen so euery sacrament and spirituall sacrifice receiued or offered in time of the gospell is vnprofitable to man and vnacceptable vnto god if it be not receiued in faith in euery sacrament wee receiue some thing from god as in euery sacrifice we giue some thing to god in the lord supper as the minister giues the bread and wine into the hand of the receiuer so the lord god giues his son vnto their hearts now if faith be wanting christ crucified is not receiued for faith is the hand of the soule without which there is no receiuing of christ amp his benefits but contrariwise a heauy and feareful sinne heaping vp god wrath against vs hereby we learne how sundry sorts of people sin most grieuously against god for many come to receiue the lord supper who are altogether ignorant in the nature amp vse thereof not knowing what the sacrament meaneth amp yet because it is a custom in the church they will receiue at least once a yeare though they know nothing therein as they ought now such persons must know they ought to come in faith which they cannot do because they want knowledge and therefore in receiuing it so they commit a grieuous sin amp so indanger their own soules because they receiue it vnworthily and this is not the fault of young ones onely but of many whose yeares might shame them for their ignorance if they were not past all feeling of spirituall wants a second sort there are who receiue the lord supper amp say they will doe so because they haue faith but these are like the former for their faith is nothing but honest dealing among man thinking that if they bring that to the l supper though they haue no more yet all is well the greatest sort are of this minde taking fidelitie for true faith amp it is a plaine point of popery so common as almost in euery place man do embrace it but these deceiue themselues for another kinde of faith is required of those that receiue the lord supper worthily namely such a faith wherby we doe not onely beleeue the remission of sins in christs blood but also are assured that the bread amp wine receiued worthily are signes and seales of the same blessing exhibited vnto vs by christ he that comes onely in a good meaning deceiues himselfe amp receiues to his condemnatio and yet alas many euen of the ancient sort haue no other faith but their good meaning a third sort there are who yet goe further and knowing the vanitie of this opinion that a mans fidelitie in his dealing with man should bee his faith to commend him vnto god they hold amp know that true faith is to beleeue their owne saluation in the blood of christ and these are to bee commended in respect of the former but herein they faile that comming to receiue they bring not with them a liuely faith for it is not only required in a communicant that hee professe the faith of christ aright but a worthy receiuer must looke to his owne heart that his faith therein be a liuing faith such as worketh by loue and shewes it selfe by obedience now herein many that haue good knowledge doe grieuously offend that howsoeuer they make a shew of faith in an orderly and religious carriage of theselues on the comunio day yet whe that time is a little past they returne to their former sinnes againe neuer els hauing any care nay not so much as making any shew of laying away their sinnes saue onely at the receiuing of the lord supper and thus do too many of those who make a faire profession these man bring faith in profession but yet their faith is dead for if it were a liuely faith it would purifie their hearts amp cause a change in them from evil to good and from good to better euery day more and more but blessed be god by whose mercy it comes to passe that there are some in his church who come with such a faith and thereby communicate acceptably to god and fruitfully to themselues yet wee must confesse they are but fewe in comparison but as for all the other three sorts of people they sinne grieuously because they bring not the hand of a liuely faith to receiue those things which their god offereth vnto them wee therefore in this example are admonished to celebrate amp receiue the lord supper in such sort as moses did namely in faith and that not in an idle or dead but in a liuely faith which may both before and after the receiuing of this sacrament bring forth good fruits to the reforming of our liues in continuall obedience for god glory and our owne comfort and saluation in christ obserue further moses ordained and made the passe ouer we may not thinke that moses killed all the lambes that were to be slaine at this passeouer but in his own familie he killed his owne lambe and inioyned the people from god to doe the like in theirs the like phrase is often vsed in the scripture iosua iosua is said to circumcise the sonnes of israel which was almost a thing impossible for one man to doe but the meaning thereof is this that iosua inioyned amp procured that all the people should be circumcised and saw it done and so wee must vnderstand this place now in this that moses did in this manner celebrate this passeouer wee are taught this lesson that gouernours and superiours in their place must procure that those which e vnder their gouernment doe keep the commandements of god and especially those which concerne god worship it is the commandement of the lord by moses that the king should haue the lawe written that hee may learne to feare his god and keepe all the words of this lawe written to doe them now how shall the king doe all the words of the lawe seeing there bee many commandements that doe not concerne him nor his place but his subiects and other particular man of other callings surely thus hee must doe those in his own person that concerne him in his place and then see that his subiects and servant doe likewise such duties both towards god and man as concerne them in their places this is a speciall point concerning all magistrates and superiours whatsoeuer and therefore paul saith rom the magistrate beareth not the sword for nought but for the wealth of god people that is for their good not in body onely but principally for the good of their soules and therefore euery gouernour either of towne or kingdome and euery master of a family within the compasse of his calling is to see that those which are vnder him keep god commandements especially those which concerne god worship when a magistrate shall do this then the praise amp honour of the whole is giuen to him as here the killing of the passeouer is ascribed to moses because he saw that the people did it so on the contrary if the magistrate be negligent in his duty hee becomes the greatest sinner of all for then the sinnes that are committed through his default are ascribed to him nehemiah reproouing the rulers tels them that they brake the lord sabbaoths nehem when as not onely they but the people also brake them yet there he chargeth the sinne of the people vpon them because it came through their negligence as if any sinne be committed in a family through the defect of the gouernour of the family it is not only the sin of the particular partie but the gouernors sin and so when any man sins in breaking the sabbaoth it is not only the sinne of that particular man but of the gouernours to whom he is subiect and therfore gouernors must see that god comandements be kept of those that be vnder their gouernment but here some may obiect as indeede some abuse the place to this end that it seemes no man may bee barred fro the l supper for the like reason is in the lord supper that was in the passeouer but moses kept the pasouer himselfe and commanded al the people of israel so to doe therefore no man is to be put from god table ans it is true indeede that in egypt at the celebration of the first passeouer moses kept it himselfe amp comanded euery master of a family among the israelites to do the same amp the reason hereof was because at the first institution the passeouer was both a signe and a means of a temporal deliuerance besides the spirituall and therefore there was great reason then why all the israelites should eate the passeouer and none be put back because all of them were to escape the temporall punishment which god was to inflict vpon the egyptians but afterward the lord made a lawe that if any were but legally vncleane hee might not eat the passeouer but must stay til the next moneth amp the come and onely the cleane must eate thereof so that the lord himselfe did inhibit som from that sacrament wherby it is plaine that the celebration of the passe ouer is so farre from giuing warrant to this confusion and carelesse admitting of all to the communion that rather it proueth that there must be a distinction made and a separation of the vnworthy from the lord table those which are fitly prepared are to be receiued but notorious offenders who are morally amp spiritually vnclean are to be put back till by repentance they haue testified their worthinesse let vs consider the signification of the passe ouer for the paschal lambe was a signe of christ the true lamb of god shadowing out diverse things worthy our obseruation as first the lambe for the passe ouer was to be a lamb of a yeare olde without spot or blemish which signified vnto vs that christ was that immaculate lamb of god and without spot as peter calleth him peter secondly the paschall lamb when it was killed amp eaten had no bone of it broken so was it comanded exod amp numb signifying that christ when he was crucified should not haue a bone of him broken as s john applieth the former texts john thirdly the paschall lamb must be eaten with sower hearbs exodus signifying that no man can feele any sweetnes in the bloud of christ till he haue his heart full of bitternesse for his sinnes and with hanna be sore vexed and troubled in minde so as he can poure out his soule before the lord sam the want of this is the cause why so many do heare god word and receiue the sacraments and yet reape no benefit by them fourthly before the paschall lambe was eaten all leauen must be remoued out of their houses this had a notable signification which we neede not to ghesse at seeing the holy ghost hath set it downe namely that wee must remoue all olde leauen of corrupt doctrine matthew out of our hearts and the leauen of sinne and wickednesse out of our liues if wee professe communion with christ this is a point worth our marking for vnlesse we doe so wee shall haue no benefit by the sacrifice of christ for if we will liue in this olde leauen we must neuer looke to receiue christ iesus into our hearts lastly euery person receiued the passe ouer in haste with shooes on their feete with staues in their hands and their cloth girt vp exod yet this we must vnderstand onely of the first passe ouer in egypt for christ did eate it sitting now this ceremonie vsed in the first passe ouer signified thus much that if we looke to haue benefit by christ we must be of this minde to be alwaies ready to leaue this world and be prepared to go when amp whither god shall call vs we must not haue our hearts glewed to earthly things but alwaies ready to receiue god commaund and to goe at his call these be the significations of the passe ouer which wee must remember to make good vse of in the course of our liues and thus much of the first branch of this act of moses faith in ordaining the passe ouer the second branch of this worke is this and the effusion of bloud that is the sprinkling of the bloud of the lambe vpon the posts of their houses and vpon the doore cheeks which was a token to the israelites that the destroying angell should not strike the first borne of the israelites either man or beast in mans reason this may seeme to be a weake amp simple meanes yet god ordaines it to preserue all the first borne among the israelites and thus the lord vseth to deale that his people through the weakenesse of the meanes might be brought to acknowledge god to be their protectour and defender when the israelites were stung with the serpents a man would haue thought it had beene the best way for their curing to haue giuen them cunning surgeons but the lord ordaines onely a dead serpent of brasse which they must looke vp vnto and be cured a weake meanes it was and yet the lord vseth it because hee would haue them to giue all the glory vnto him and not to ascribe the same either to themselues or to the meanes further this sprinkling of the bloud vpo the doore cheeks and the posts of their houses had a notable signification namely of the sprinkling of the bloud of christ vpo the doors of our hearts to which peter alludeth peter through the obedience and sprinkling of the bloud of iesus christ and dauid when he saith sprinkle me with hisope and i shall be cleane dauid knew well that the bloud of beast could not take away sinne and therefore no doubt by his sauing faith he had an eye to the bloud of the messias vnder legall tearmes whence we are taught this lesson that as the israelites with their bodily hands did sprinkle y e bloud of the paschall lamb vpon their doore cheeks amp the posts of their houses so by the hand of faith euery one of vs must sprinkle the bloud of christ vpon our owne hearts which we shall then doe when we doe not onely in generall beleeue that christ is a sauiour and redeemer but particularly that hee is a redeemer vnto vs and that the merits of his death and the benefit of his bloud are ours obiect but some will say if this be so then all is well for i doe beleeue this answer heerein very many deceiue themselues thinking that they haue faith when indeede they haue none for looke vnto their wayes and see into their hearts by their liues and it wil easily appeare that they haue nothing in them but ignorance security amp presumption in sinne now such man are deceiuers of their owne soules for after this sprinkling followeth sanctification and rising from dead workes to newnesse of life so that they that liue in sinne and yet say they haue faith deceiue themselues for if a mans heart be sprinkled with the bloud of christ through faith it will change his life amp conscience and make him a new creature for christes bloud is a cleansing and purifying bloud insomuch as where it is truly sprinkled it certainly cleanseth hebrewes and thus much of this ceremonie of sprinkling now followeth the end of both these actions in these words lest he that destroyed the first borne should touch them let vs examine the words in order first by the destroyer is meant the angell of god as wee may see in the storie exod who at midnight smote all the first borne of egypt both of man and beast where by the way wee may take a view of the wonderfull power and strength of god angels and also of their admirable swiftnesse and readinesse in doing the will of god that in one night euen at midnight one of them could passe through the land of egypt and kill all the first borne of man and beast in euerie place of the egyptians the like we may see in the destruction of senacheribs host by one angell in one night the first borne that is both of man and beast so it is in the story exod but being so it may not vnfitly be demaunded how this passe ouer could be a sacrament when as euen the beast of the israelites had benefit by it for they were spared by reason of this sprinkling of the blood of the paschall lamb answer that hindreth not why it should not be a sacrament for wee must consider this passe ouer two wayes first as a meanes of temporall deliuerance and so the beast had benefit by it secondly as a signe and seale of our spirituall deliuerance from hell by the sacrifice of the lamb of god iesus christ which is the thing signified and so it is a sacrament for mans saluation and thus the beast had no benefit by it the water that flowed from the rock in the wildernesse was a sacrament and the beast drank of the water but yet they did not partake of the lord sacrament for wee must consider that water two wayes first as a meanes to quench thirst and consequently as an outward benefit to preserue the life of the creature amp so the beast had a benefit by it but cosider it as a signe amp seale of the water of life and so their beast had no benefit by it but onely the belieuing people it followeth should touch them here is the very vse and ende of both the former actions that the angel might not hurt them but passe by the israelites houses here consider a notable point concerning christ the true passeouer namely that they which haue their hearts sprinkled with his blood shal be preserued from euerlasting damnation and not onely so but hereby they shall haue deliuerance from all temporall iudgements in this life so farre forth as they are curses amp hurtful vnto the so we may read before the destruction came to the city of the iewes the angel of god went through the citie with a writers ink horne to set a marke vpon those that did mourne and crie for their sinnes and dauid saith the righteous man standeth vpon a rocke so as the floods of many water shall not come neere him this is a point of great vse and the consideration hereof should mooue all persons that haue beene carelesse in religion now to become carefull and desirous to haue their hearts washed in the blood of christ amp those also which haue any care must haue double care hereof for they haue freedome and securitie both in temporall and eternall iudgements obiect but many of god deare children are taken away in common iudgements answer true but yet they are neuer hurt thereby but the iudgement and affliction is sanctified vnto them because they haue their hearts sprinkled with the blood of christ and as for those whom god knoweth it good for they are deliuered in generall iudgements and preserued for his glory and vse of the church but how did the angel destroy the first born in egypt both of man and beast answer by taking from them their teporal liues by destroying or killing their body that is the sense and plaine meaning of the holy ghost amp to this signification answereth the word in the originall now some doe abuse this place amp such like for the ouerthrowing of the anciet cesure of the church in excomunicatio for say they the practice of s paul corinthian is the principall ground of excommunication where paul bids that the incestuous man be giuen to satan for the destructio of the flesh now they that denie excommunication would haue that place to bee interpreted by this because the same word is there vsed and therfore say they pauls words must bee vnderstood of destroying the incestuous mans body and taking away his temporall life this interpretation doth quite ouerthrowe excommunication for if nothing else be there vnderstood but onely the tormenting of the body then excommunication is not thence prooued but the truth is that that censure which the apostle vrgeth there cannot bee vnderstood of the punishment of the body which i prooue thus in that place s paul opposeth the flesh and the spirit now vsually when he maketh this opposition flesh signifieth the corruption of the whole man amp the spirit signifieth the grace of god in the man so that his plaine meaning is this let him be deliuered to satan for the destruction of the flesh that is for the destruction of his naturall corruption and of the body of sinne further where it is said the first borne wee must vnderstand it of the first borne among the egyptians both of man and beast and whereas he saith should touch them he meaneth the israelites who were not touched in this destruction hence we learne two points further the first borne of egypt are destroyed both of man and beast this is markeable for the egyptians in former times destroyed the israelites children and especially their first borne for they slew all the males lest they should increase in their land and now it comes to passe that their children euen the principall of them their first borne are slaine for the israelites sake and when they are preserued where wee may obserue a most righteous and yet an vsuall kinde of iudgement with god hee doth often punish the wicked in their kind with their owne sinnes this is true euen in the best so farre forth as they are sinnefull the same iniurie which dauid did to vriah was done vnto him by his owne son euen by his son absolon sam v and and this our sauiour christ teacheth vs saying math iudge not that ye bee not iudged we find this true likewise by experience they that giue themselues to back biting rayling amp slaundering by the iust iudgement of god haue for the most part the same done vnto themselues by others so that man are often punished in their owne sinnes for god hath his store house full of iudgements and hee can punish man what way hee will but hee oft obserueth this order to punish man by their owne sinnes and to catch the wicked in their owne deuises this must bee a motiue to make vs to looke vnto our selues and to haue care against all sinnes of the second table for looke wherein thou takest thy pleasure to god dishonour therein shalt thou feele and see god iudgement vpon thee to thy correction and confusion psalm as hee loued cursing so shall it come vnto him and as he loued not blessing so shall it be farre from him this adonibezek felt and confessed when his thumbes were cut off iudg as i haue done so god hath rewarded me lastly in that the destroyer killeth the first borne of egypt marke a strange kinde of god iudgements king pharaoh and his people sinne because they wil not let the israelites goe but the punishment of their sinne is laid vpon their children and cattell the like wee reade of sam when dauid had committed those grieuous sinnes of adulterie and murther a part of his punishment was the death of his child when he numbred the people the plague light on them sam now we must not too curiously prie into the reason of this course of god iudgements for he is not bound to giue account of his actions amp yet in reason we may see the equitie thereof for we must consider of kingdomes and societies and of townes and families as of body euery societie is a body and the particular persons therein are members of that body now looke as it is in the naturall body so it is in the body ciuill or politicke oftentimes in the naturall body when the stomach is sicke the head aketh the braine is wounded and the heart aketh the foote is hurt and the head aketh and the offence of the tongue may be punished with stripes vpon the backe euen so it is in ciuill societies the prince sinneth and the people are punished or the p ople sinne and the prince is punished this is no iniustice with god for since prince and people make but one body and so parents and children god may iustly lay vpon any member the temporall punishment of sinne committed by another and thus much of this example and of the faith of moses alone by faith they passed through the red sea as by drie land which when the egyptians had assayed to doe they were drowned hitherto wee haue heard the faith of moses alone highly commended in two examples now followeth a commendation of his faith with others so that heere is a new example of faith to wit of the israelites together with moses for moses is heere to be considered not onely as one of them but as a principall agent in this work of faith and here their faith is commended vnto vs by a wonderful strange action which they did through the power and goodnesse of god namely by their passing through the red sea not by passing ouer it for that might haue beene by article but through it which is aboue nature and article amp meerly miraculous this fact of theirs is largely set down exod and that it might appeare to be euery way wonderful as it is indeede the author of this epistle commends it by two circumstances which notably set forth vnto vs the strangenesse hereof first by their manner how they passed through namely as by dry land secondly by y e time whe namely then when the egyptians following the were drowned here first we will speake of the fact it selfe and then of the circumstances the fact is set downe in the first words by faith they passed through the red sea the words are plaine of themselues and offer vnto vs sundry points worthy our obseruation and first it may be asked who they were that heere passed through by faith the answere is the israelites but some will say wee reade in the historie that when the people came to the red sea they were wonderfully afraide and murmured against moses saying that it had beene better for them to haue liued in the bondage of egypt then to come into the desart and there die now how can they murmure impatiently and fearefully and yet passe through by faith answere at the first indeede they murmured when they saw the danger they were in hauing the huge armie of pharaoh following them and the red sea before them and hills and mountaines on each side but howsoeuer they murmured at the first yet when moses spake words of comfort vnto them in the name of the lord bidding them not to be afraid ampc and when he held vp his rod and entred into the red sea before them then they followed him by faith and heereupon the holy ghost giues vnto them the title of true beleeuers heere we may learne that true faith in god children is mingled with vnbeliefe the israelites faith was true faith but yet it was very imperfect and weake for if it had beene perfect amp sound faith they would neuer haue murmured nor haue beene impatient and fearefull but looke as it is in nature so it is in grace in nature we cannot passe from one contrary to another but by the mixture of the contraries as in light and darknesse the one doth not followe the other immediatly but first there is a mixture of them both in the dawning of the day and closing of the night and so it is in other contraries euen in those which concerne the soule vnbeliefe is a sinne faith is a vertue and grace contrary to it now vnbeliefe cannot be expelled by faith before there be a mixture of them both and so when faith preuaileth vnbeliefe decayeth neither can faith be euer perfect because it is euer mingled more or lesse with vnbeliefe this plainely ouerthrowes the opinion of the church of rome who say that after a man is regenerate and beleeues there is nothing in him that god can hate for they imagine that he is so throughly sanctified that there is nothing in him which may properly be called a sinne but here we see their doctrine is false seeing faith amp vnbeliefe are alwaies mingled together secondly as it falls out with faith so it is with the rest of god graces looke as faith is not perfect but mixed with vnbeliefe so are all other graces of god whatsoeuer the feare of god is not perfect in a man nor the loue of god for the feare of god is mingled with the feare of man and the feare of god for his mercy is mingled with the feare of god for his iudgements and heereby many are deceiued for when they feare god for his punishments they thinke themselues to be most miserable and voyde of grace but they deceiue themselues for there is no man vpon the earth that feareth god onely for his mercies and doth not feare god also for his punishments in part for god graces in this life are euer mingled with their contraries and therfore to imagine that a man may feare god for his mercies onely and not for iudgements also is to conceiue of such a man as none is nor can be in this life for the best feare that is in any man liuing is a mixt feare further when moses had spoken words of comfort vnto them the vnbelieuing and fearefull israelites do stir vp their hearts to belieue so wee accordingly must labour and striue against that in bred vnbeliefe which is in vs for euery man hath innumerable sinnes in him that resist faith and if they bee not checked and suppressed they will master his faith but hee that would haue faith to continue and last must striue against natural vnbeleefe as the israelites do in this place and as the man in the gospel mark when hee said to christ lord i beleeue helpe my vnbeleefe knowing that his vnbeleefe did suppresse his faith and so did the disciples of our sauiour christ when they prayed lord increase our faith luke and dauid beeing oppressed with deadnesse of heart stirres vp his faith saying why article thou cast down my soule ampc waite on god psalm v for he that hath faith is troubled with vnbeleefe and the more it troubles him the lesse he beleeueth vnlesse hee striue against it manfully quest but how many of the israelites beleeued and went ouer by faith ans not all for paul saith with many of them god was not well pleased for they were ouerthrowen in the wildernesse corinthian which shewes that all that passed ouer had not true faith for some beleeued and by the force of their faith all went ouer safely hence wee note this which hath beene often taught vs that an vngodly man receiueth many temporal benefits by the societie of god people which beleeue as here the vnbeleeuing israelites had this benefit to goe through the redde sea safely by reason of those that beleeued and in the former example the brute beast were freed fro killing by the angel because they belonged to the host of the lord people now shall a brute beast haue benefit by beeing with god people and shall not a man much more yes vndoubtedly for so wee may reade that for pauls sake all the mariners and souldiers that were in the shippe were saued from drowning act this point must perswade euery one of vs to make choyce of the godly for our societie and company with whom we liue and conuerse for by them we reape many benefits and freedome also from many heauy iudgements the third point is this when did the israelites beleeue this circumstance is worth the marking they beleeued when they passed through the redde sea for they beleeued not onely in generall that god was their god as hee had promised to their fathers but they beleeued that god would bee with them and giue them life in the middle of the redde sea a notable point they beleeued as it were in the middle of their graues for so might the redde sea be well called that god would giue them life euerlasting and preserue them safely through the sea and from their enemy in their example wee are taught the same dutie to doe as they here did the childe of god in this life hath innumerable causes of desperation and sometimes his owne conscience wil take part with satan in charging the soule to bee in state of damnation in this heauie case what must bee done surely at this time when a man is a cast away in himselfe he must euen then beleeue beeing in hell as it were hee must beleeue that god will bring him to heauen it is nothing for a man to beleeue in prosperitie and peace but in time of desperation to beleeue that is a most worthy faith and indeede then is the right time for a man to shew his faith when there is in himselfe no cause of beleeuing obiect but when a man is in this case he cannot beleeue answer indeede to beleeue then is a wonderfull hard thing and a miracle of miracles but yet this is the propertie of true faith so to doe and if there bee but one dramme of true faith in the heart that despaires howsoeuer it may for a time lie hidde as dead yet at the length it will make him to hope and waite for mercy and life at the hands of almightie god and therefore if it shall please god at any time to lay a torment vpon our consciences so as wee shall striue with the wrath of god thinking that hee hath cast vs away yet for all that then we must beleeue god promises and set before vs his mercies and therewith refresh vs and if this faith were not the childe of god many sundry times were in a most miserable case the lord therefore hath most mercifully prouided to helpe him by the grace of faith when a man is past all hope of life he must then beleeue and hope for life as the israelites did in the red sea for preseruation and vndoubtedly this is a comfortable signe of grace if a man in the horrour of conscience can shewe forth the least sparke of true faith fourthly note the effect and issue of this faith they passed through the red sea we say vsually that water amp fire be vnmercifull creatures and therefore the naturall man feares them both but the israelites faith makes them not to feare the water but it makes them bold euen to passe thorough the sea the like we may see for fire in the children daniel who were not affraid of the hot burning ouen but were as bold in it as out of it rauenous amp wilde beast are terrible vnto man but faith makes a man not to feare them and therefore daniel feares not the lyons though hee were throwen into their denne to bee deuoured daniel great is the fruite and force of faith it takes from a man the feare of those creatures which by nature are most terrible and here wee see a cause why the holy martyrs of god died most cheerefully a man would thinke it strange that one should goe into the fire reioycing as many of them did but the reason is because they had faith in their hearts which taketh away the feare of the most fearefull creatures but if it bee so may some say that the israelites by faith went through the redde sea not fearing the water why may not we that beleeue now doe the same for wee haue the same faith that they had answer wee haue indeede the same faith and yet wee cannot passe through water as they did for their faith rested on two promises first on this made to abraham i will bee thy god and the god of thy seed secodly on a particular promise made to moses for when he comanded him to goe through the red sea withall he made a promise to keepe and preserue them and this they beleeued and so went through now howsoeuer we haue iustifying faith hauing the same generall promise yet we haue not the like particular promise that if wee passe through the red sea god will be with vs and saue vs and therefore if any man shall adventure to doe so let him looke for nothing but death for it is not an action of faith but of presumption and therefore peter sunke when hee would needs walke vnto christ vpon the sea hauing no such hold vpon god speciall promise as here they had and the egyptians following presumptuously were drowned wherfore let vs here be warned not to attempt to doe extraordinary workes without god special warrant for a particular faith requires a particular promise besides the generall promise of god in christ further let vs here obserue a wonderfull worke of god mercy and power when these servant of god were brought into extremitie of danger so as they were in a desperate case for their temporall life yet then the lord findes a way of deliuerance and indeede if a man consider aright of it hee must needes acknowledge that these israelites were in a pittifull case for they had the red sea before them and mountains on each side and themselues hindred from flight by their bag and baggage and with their children and the huge hoste of pharaoh behinde them so as to mans reason there was nothing but present death to bee looked for yet the lord in mercy to saue them makes a way where there was no way and opens them a gappe to life when naturall reason could lay before them nothing but violent death which shewes the wonderfull mercy of god to his owne people and servant and the like thing we may read of in dauid when he abode in the wildernes e of maon for there saul followed him and he and his man compassed dauid and his man round about sam now what hope of deliuerance was there for dauid ans surely this only dauid was the servant of god amp the lord preserued him that hee might rule his people after sauls death and therfore he escapeth though wonderfully for a messenger comes to saul and bids him haste for the philistims inuaded the land and so saul returned from pursuing dauid and went against the philistims hence we learne this generall rule that in the extremitie of all danger god hath meanes to preserue and saue his owne children and people which must teach vs to commend our case to god and to rest on him in all dangers for when our case is desperate in our sight then are we fittest for god helpe let vs therefore in such cases learne to practice our faith and then especially to cast our selues vpon god this iehosaphat did most notably for beeing assaulted with the huge armies of the moabites ammonites ampc he praied vnto the lord most feruently saying chronicle lord there is no strength in vs wee knowe not what to doe but our eies are towards thee and thus doing was preserued for god will in no extremitie forsake them that trust in him the red sea in many places of the olde testament it is called the sea of rushes psalm or the sea of sedges ier it is a corner of the arabian sea that parteth egypt and arabia those which haue seene it in trauell say it hath no other colour than all other seas haue why then is it called the red sea answer to omit many supposed causes hereof ther be two especially for which it is so called because of the red sand for both the bottome of the sea and the shoare are full of redder sande than ordinarily is else where some thinke it is called the redde sea by reason of the sedges and bul rushes which growe much at the sea side and bee of a redde colour which by reflection may make the same colour appeare on the water but this neede not to trouble any man for the holy ghost vseth the same name which commonly the man of that countrey gaue vnto it and thus much of their fact that they by faith passed through the redde sea now we come to the two circumstances whereby it is commended the first circumstance is the manner of their going through the red sea they went through as on dry land this must not be conceiued to be by help of bridge or shippe nor by meanes which man vse as swimming failing or wading but their passage was miraculous for the water stood like walls on both sides of them and the channel of the sea was as a pauement or dry land exod which notably setteth forth the strangenesse of this fact shewing that it was a wonderfull work of god and this also confuteth certaine enemy of the scripture who haue cauilled at all the miracles which are recorded therein accounting of moses but as a magician and sorcerer amp of the miracles which he did as of illusions and for this miracle they make no account of it for say they moses being a great scholler and a wise man knew the time of the rise and fall of the water amp knew the fords and shallowe places therfore he took his time and found a place so shallow that when the tide was past the sands were bare amp dry as the marshes in england are and then he led the hoast of israell through but pharaoh amp his hoast following them were drowned because they went through at the flowing of the sea ans whereas they say that this their passage was no miracle heere we see it is ouerthrowen by this circumstance of the maner of their passing ouer for the bottom of the sea was as a pauement amp as ground on which no water fal now in most places of the sea where the water ebb and flowe the ground is neuer fully dry but watery and full of moist places againe the water passed not away as at an ebbe but stoode as walls on each side of the hoast of israell both on the right hand and on the left both which shew plainely there was no vantage taken by the ebbing and flowing of the water as vngodly atheists do cauill deriding god works to their own destructio but a mighty amp miraculous work of god first making the water stand like two walls and then making the earth vnder it firme amp dry contrary to nature in them both the circumstance is concerning the time when they passed through euen then when the egyptians assaying to doe the same were drowned marke the words for the thing is strange the egyptians come armed after the israelites with a huge great armie now the israelites they take into the sea and the egyptians seeing them stand not still vpon the banke but adventure after them not by ship but the same way that the israelites tooke before them but yet without any warrant or commaundement from god so great was their malice against them amp yet a man would haue thought they durst neuer haue aduentured into the sea after them especially as they did here by this fact of pharaoh amp his man we learne that when god forsakes a man and leaues him to himselfe he doth nothing else but run headlong to his own destructio god as moses saith raised vp pharaoh to shew his power vpon him and now it pleaseth god to leaue him to himselfe and he pursueth the israelites to his own destruction and this is the course and state of all those that are forsaken of god the consideration whereof must teach vs a speciall clause to be vsed of vs in our prayers wee must euer remember to pray for this that god would neuer wholly forsake vs nor cast vs off this condition is more fearefull than the estate and condition of any creature in the world besides for when god forsakes a man all that he doth is hastening himselfe to his owne destruction dauid knew this well and therefore he praies oh knit my heart vnto thee that i may feare thy name psalm and againe he praieth that the lord would not forsake him ouer long psalm as if he should say if it be thy pleasure to try me by leauing me to my selfe yet o lord let it be but for awhile forsake me not ouer long this is the scope of the sixt petition leade vs not into temptation where wee are taught to pray that god would not forsake vs or leaue vs to our selues or to the power of satan but that he would be with vs and shew his power in our weaknesse continually and this may enforce vs vnto this petition for the consideration that man forsaken of god doe nothing but worke their owne destruction is many times a cause of great trouble of minde for some desiring to see such as hang or drowne themselues by beholding of them get this conceite into their heads that god will likewise forsake them as he hath done these whom they behold amp so shall they make away themselues whence followeth great trouble amp anguish of soule for a long time now how must a man or woman in this case helpe themselues answere the best way is by prayer to craue at god hands that he would euer be with them and neuer wholly forsake them and further this must be remembred withall that god will neuer forsake any of his servant before they first forsake him and therefore they that can say truly and vnfainedly that they desire to serue god and to be his servant and seeke this blessing by prayer they may stand fast on this ground that god will neuer forsake them till they first forsake him and therefore azariah the prophet saith notably to king asa chronicle the lord will be with you while you be with him and if ye seeke him hee will be found of you but if ye forsake him hee will forsake you and iames saith draw neere to god and he will draw neere to you iames it was neuer heard that god did euer forsake any that did seeke him and if the causes were knowen why man make away themselues it would prooue generally to be thus because they first by some fearefull sins haue forsaken god amp then he in his iustice forsakes them and therfore they that are troubled with this temptation must pray that they may sticke fast vnto god by faith and holinesse amp so will e neuer forsake them secondly in this circumstance that the egyptians following the israelites were drowned we haue a notable pattern of the state amp condition of all persecuters of god church in pharaoh and his hoast wee may see their end which is vsually destruction that is their reward for persecuting god church cain slaies abell that notable servant of god but his reward was this hee was cast forth of god church gen and striken in god iust iudgement with finall desperation saul persecuted dauid but his end was to kill himselfe with his own sword samuel and iesabell she persecutes the prophets amp children of god but her end was this the dogs did eate her flesh the whole stock of the herods were great enemy to christ but their name was soone rooted out and herod called agrippa that slew iames and persecuted peter was eaten vp of wormes many great emperours in the primatiue church were persecuters but they died desperatly and iulian for one once a christian died blaspheming christ amp casting his bloud vp towards heauen cried thou hast ouercome galilean thou hast ouercome and to come neerer these times what reward from god the persecuters of the church haue had we may reade in the booke of acts amp monuments which was penned for that purpose and to come to these our daies the whole band of those that call theselues leaguers in fraunce italy spaine ampc like the tabernacles of edom and the ismaelites moab and the agarims ampc psalm they vow the destruction amp persecution of god church but yet god church stands amp he so cotriues the matter that they draw swords against theselues amp slay amp poyson one another herein doth god graciously make good his promise to his church that the weapons made against her shal not prosper and zachary there is a prophecie of y e church in the new testament the lord saith he wil make ierusalem that is his church an heauy stone for all people that lift it vp shal be torn though all the people of the earth be gathered against it where the prophet setteth down notably what shal be the condition of those that persecute god church the more they persecute her the more they shall haue god hand against them to confound them daniel there is mention made of a stone hewen out of a rocke without hands which smote the image vpon the feete which were of iron amp clay amp brake them to peeces by that stone is meant the kingdom of christ which shall dash in peeces the kingdomes of the earth which set themselues against christ and his kingdome for christ must raigne till hee haue put all his enemy vnder his feete so that destruction is the ende of the enemy of god church for the hand of the lord shall bee knowen among his servant and his indignation against his enemy isay and thus much of the circumstance now in this whole fact of the israelites passing thorough the red sea towards the land of canaan there is a notable thing signified namely baptisme so paul saith the israelites were baptized vnto moses in the sea corinthian yet wee must remember it was not ordinary baptisme but extraordinary neuer administred before and neuer shall be so again for ought we know the minister of this baptisme was moses an extraordinary minister as the baptisme was extraordinary the outwarde signe was the red sea or rather the water of the redde sea the departing of the children of israel out of egypt thorough the redde sea signifieth the departing of the children of god out of the kingdome of darkenesse from the power of sin and satan and the drowning of pharaoh with all his hoste in the redde sea signified the subduing of the power of all spirituall enemy with the pardon and death of sinne which stands partly in the abolishing of sinne and partly in newnesse of life and to this alludeth the prophet micah saying he will subdue our iniquities and cast all their sinnes into the bottome of the sea micah as if he should say looke as god subdued pharaoh and all his hoste in the bottome of the sea so will he cast and put away the sinnes of his people from this we learne two points that the baptisme of infants hath warrat in god word howsoeuer some me be of a contrary opinion for here we see all the israelites were baptized in the sea and among them no doubt were many children if it be said this baptisme was extraordinary and is no ground for ours answer true it was extraordinary for the manner but yet herein the matter and substance and the thing signified is ordinary and the end all one with ours and therefore the baptizing of infants in the red sea is some warrant for the baptisme of infants in the church now adaies secondly here we may learne another instruction as the israelites went through the red sea as through a graue to the promised land of canaan so we must know that the way to the spirituall canaan euen the kingdome of heauen is by dying vnto sinne this is a speciall point to bee considered of euery one of vs we professe our selues to be christians wee heare god word and receiue the sacraments which are the outward badges of christians and we perswade our selues of life euerlasting after death wel if we would haue that to be the ende of our iourney then we must take the lord plaine way in this life which is to die vnto all our sinnes so it is said they which are christs haue crucified the flesh with the affections and lustes thereof where this duty is inioyned to euery christian hee must crucifie the lusts and affections of the flesh and not liue in sinne for a man cannot walke in sinne and so runne the broad way to hell and yet waite for the kingdome of heauen these two will not stand together and therefore if we would walke worthy the calling of christianitie wee must haue care that all our sins whether they bee of heart or life little or great new or olde may be mortified and abolished many will for a time become ciuill and seeme to be religious especially when they are to receiue the lord supper but when that time of the sacrament is past then they returne to their old custome in sinning againe wherby it appeares that their change was but in shew to blind the eies of man and doe we not each sabbaoth professe our selues good christians and seeme to glory in it by keeping this day with such solemnitie but alas as soone as that day is past many amp some euen this day runne into all ryot this is not christianity this is not the way to heauen but if euer we thinke to come to canaan we must kill and bury our sinnes we must die vnto them or else we shal neuer come to the ende of christianity namely eternall life and thus much of this circumstance and also of the example it selfe by faith the walls of iericho fel down after they were compassed about seuen daies from the beginning of this chapter to this verse we haue heard two sorts of examples of faith the first of beleeuers from the beginnning of the world to the flood the second of such as were from the time of the floode to the giuing of the lawe in mount sina and of both these we haue hitherto intreated now here and s forward to the end of this chapter is set downe a third order of examples of faith namely of such as liued from the time of the giuing of the law to the time of the raigne of the maccabees this verse containes the first example of this ranke namely the example of iosuahs faith amp of those that went with him into canaan and their faith is commended vnto vs by a notable fact of theirs the causing to fall the walls of iericho the history whereof we may reade at large iosuah the summe of it is this whereas the israelites came vnto canaan and could not enter into the land by reason of the strength of iericho by which they must needs passe nor could win it by reason of the huge walls of iericho the lord promiseth to deliuer iericho into their hands onely the people must doe this they must compasse about the walls seauen daies amp carie the arke of the lord with them sounding with rammes hornes and showte and so the walls should fall downe now the lord hauing made this promise vnto them the israelites and specially iosuah obey his commaundement and beleeue his promise and thus doing by faith the walls of iericho fell downe after they were compassed about seauen doyes indeed the power of god was the principall cause of this ruine of the walls but yet because vpon their beleeuing god shewed this power therefore is the downfall of them ascribed to their faith here are many notable points to be learned whereas the text saith by faith the walls of iericho fell downe wee may obserue the wonde full power of true faith iosuah and the israelites beleeued god promises that hee would ouerturne the walls of iericho and as they beleeued so it came to passe so our sauiour christ saith matthew if a man had but as much faith as a graine of mustard seed he shall say vnto the mountaine remooue hence and it shall remoue and nothing shall be vnpossible vnto him signifying that by the power of true faith such things as are impossible to mans reason shall be brought to passe if god haue promised them as we see in this place the mighty walls of iericho fall downe by faith which to mans reason is impossible so the lord promised to abraham that he should be the father of many nation yes that all the nation of the earth should be blessed in him this was strange but abraham beleeued it and as hee beleeued so it came to passe for many nation descended from him and after the time of christes ascension when all the nation of the world were called to the light of the gospell they were blessed in christ the promised seede of abraham and therefore is hee called the father of the faithfull in all nation and to come vnto our selues to miserable man it may seeme a strange thing that the power of the diuell and the strength of the flesh should be ouercome in vs yet let a man beleeue this promise of god god so loued the world that hee gaue his onely begotten son that who so beleeued in him should not perish but haue euerlasting life john i say let him beleeue this effectually and hee shall finde by faith the kingdome of sinne amp satan in his heart and conscience weakned euery day more and more and therefore s john saith not without cause this is the victorie that ouercommeth the world euen our faith john here obserue that among the causes of the change amp ouerthrowe of townes cities amp kingdomes this is one namely faith in god promises many man haue written of the change of kingdoms amp do giue diverse reasons therof but most of them omit the principall and that is faith by vertue whereof many times kingdomes and townes are brought to ruine and ouerthrow god promised to abraham amp to his seed that he would giue the the land of canaan for their inheritance now they beleeued this promise amp heere wee see it comes to passe as they beleeued iericho by faith is ouerturned amp the rest of their cities amp the people of canaa dispossessed so that we see faith in god promises is a means to god people to ouerturn cities amp kingdoms that are enemy to christ and to his gospell god hath made a promise vnto his church that the whore of babylon revelation that is the kingdome of antichrist shall flourish for a while but after it shall be destroyed yes such a ruine shall come vnto it that the kings of the earth and all great man and marchants shall bewaile the destruction thereof now this promise being receiued by faith and beleeued of god church shall vndoubtedly come to passe it is in some part verified already for we see some kingdomes and people haue renounced the cursed doctrine and tyrannie of rome and many christian princes haue alreadie shaken off the popes yoke yes and this promise shall come to passe daily more and more let all the kings of that sort doe what they can and let the people set themselues neuer so much against god church yet babylon shal downe for god hath promised so to his church and his church beleeueth the same and therefore by their faith it shall be brought to passe in despite of the diuell thirdly here we learne that when any city towne or kingdome is to make war either in defence of themselues or in lawful assault vpon their enemy a speciall meanes for good successe heerein is true faith christian policie is a commendable thing in this case but if policy be seuered from faith it is nothing faith in god promises of protection and assistance doth farre surpasse all worldly wisedome and therefore good king iehosaphat when he was to fight against the huge armies of the moabites and ammonites giues this counsell to his people chronicle put your trust in the lord your god and ye shall be assured beleeue his prophets and ye shall prosper giuing a most notable instruction and shewing that the best help for our defence is faith in god whereby we rest vpon his word and promise that hee will helpe vs yet this taketh not away the vse of meanes but it giues the blessing and efficacie vnto them faith wee knowe is called a shield among the spiritual armour of god whereby a man awards the blowes of satan and though that be the principal vertue of it yet is it also a notable shield to defend man euen against their outward amp visible enemy amp a most strong engine aginst the to work their ouerthrow hence dauid saith he will not be afraid for tenne thousand of the people that should beset him round about they therefore that would defend themselues against their enemy yes and ouercome them in lawful assault must embrace amp obay true religion amp with christian policy ioyn faith in god promises for by faith we make god our captain amp throgh him we shal do valiantly and beate downe our enemy on euery side lastly heere wee may learne what a vaine thing it is to trust in outward worldly meanes the walls of iericho were both strong and high and hard it had beene to haue ouerthrowen them by ordinary meanes but yet we see it proued but a vaine thing to trust vnto them as the man of iericho did for they found but little reliefe and defence in them for the lord layes them flat to the ground and so the people of israell went straight forward and tooke the citie so likewise it is a vaine thing to trust to mans strength or in the strength of an horse or in the number of man or in riches or in gifts of wisedome and learning or in any other outward ordinary meanes whatsoeuer the reason is because god can ouerturne them with the least breath of his mouth this must admonish vs that howsoeuer we vse ordinarie meanes of our preseruation and helpe yet euer wee must cast our whole care on god and put all our confidence in him for helpe and safety for without him all other outward meanes are nothing but vaine helpes for vaine is the help of man and thus much for the fact it self further this fact is set out vnto vs by two circumstances to wit by the meanes which they vsed and by the time which they obserued for this exploit for the first when they come to iericho this strong citie which they must needes subdue or else they could not this way enter and possesse the land they do not goe about to ouerturne the citie by vndermining battering or scaling the walls but according to god appointment they go one by one in order round about the citie walls day by day for one weeke space and on the seauenth day they compasse it seuen times during all which time they kept great silence saue onely that seauen priests sounded vpon seauen trumpets of rammes hornes before the arke till iosuah bade them shout now in common reason a man would iudge this rather to be some childish sport then a means to fling downe these great walls nay consider it well and it may seeme a course tending rather to ouerthrowe themselues then the walls of iericho for they marched not in battell ray as though they would pitch a field against the people of iericho or lay siege to their citie but they went in length one before another so as they might compasse the citie about now if the man of iericho should haue come forth and made assault vpon them in all likelihood the israelites had been ouerthrowen so weake and feeble were the meanes and yet the lord for waighty causes prescribes this course vnto them to wit heerby to try the faith of his people whether they will beleeue his promises or no when they are enioyned to vse weake and feeble meanes and in mans reason foolish secondly to make manifest in the weakenesse and insufficiencie of the meanes his owne all sufficient power and wisedome for the furtherance of his glory for through weakenesse is god power made perfect corinthians chapter verse hence our sauiour christ when hee was to cure the man that was borne blinde tempers clay of spittle and layes it to his eyes john chapter verse a meanes in comon reason rather fit to make a man blinde then to recouer his sight and yet christ vseth it for the furtherance of god glory in the manifestation of his diuine power whereby the people might knowe hee was able in himselfe to doe whatsoeuer he would now looke what course the lord here takes for the battering of the walles of iericho the like he vseth in ouerthrowing the kingdome of the diuell the spirituall iericho especially in the new testament for after christs ascension when he intended to destroy the kingdome of darkenesse vnder which all the nation sate he sets apart a fewe fisher man simple persons wating worldly wit amp policy neither did hee put a sword of flesh into their hands but the word of god into their mouthes and thus sent them to dispossesse the diuell out of all the world and to batter downe the kingdome of darkenesse by their preaching and now in these later daies wherein the antichristian kingdome of the pope had spread it selfe through all places almost god vsed the same weake meanes to ouerthrow it for hee set apart a silly monke and indues him with gifts to preach the truth by which meanes the kingdome of antichrist receiued a greater wounde than if tenne princes had set themselues against it and strange it is to see how god ouerturneth all the stratagems deuised against his church and how hee vanquisheth the power of sinne by the weake meanes of the gospel preached and by the praiers of the church than which to the world nothing seemes more feeble or foolish the consideration hereof is of speciall vse for it may be wee shall see kings and people of great power and number to make reuolt from the gospel of christ and to fall to antichrist embracing popery hereat indeede wee must be grieued but yet withal here is good cause of comfort vnto vs for wee must knowe that satans kingdome must bee battered downe not so much by the power of kings as by the breath of god mouth not so much by the sword of flesh as by the sword of the spirit so it is said that the man of sinne euen antichrist must bee abolished not by the power of princes yes let all the princes amp potetates in the world do their best for him yet his kingdome must downe in god good time for god will consume him with the breath of his mouth and abolish him by the brightnesse of his comming thes that is by the preaching of the word in the mouthes of his ministers who are man voyde of all worldly power and policie yet further obserue the meanes they walke about the walles of iericho seuen daies together if man should attempt the like enterprise at this day in all likelihood it would cost them their liues for now there are deuised such instrumets of war i mean great ordinance amp field pieces that will kill afar off amp vndoubtedly if ther had bin such instruments of war in this city the israelites could not so safely haue compassed the walles so many daies together whereby it appeares more than probable that in those daies there were no gunnes knowen no not amongst the heathen which at this day are so rise amongst christians whence may be gathered that these later daies are perillous times for now mens heads are set to deuise more hurtfull meanes against the life of man than euer the savage heathen knew for beside the inuention of gunnes which put downe all euidence of prowesse and valour seene in ancient war our age exceedes in contriuing such strange kindes of poysons as were neuer knowen in former times for man haue now deuised poyson of that sort that will kill a man not presently but a weeke or a moneth or a quarter of a yeare after as appeares by the confession of those that haue giuen themselues to studie and practice such hurtful deuises and it is worth the marking that the principall inuentors and practicers of such hurtfull inuentions haue been of the roman religion the second circumstance to be obserued is the time of this exploite it was not on any of the first sixe daies but on the seuenth and that after they had that day compassed the citie about seuen times then when the priests blew the trumpets and all the people showted as iosuah bade them the walles of iericho fell downe for this was the time which god had appointed for this exploit the reason why god appointed seuen daies and seuen times copassing on the seuenth day is not reuealed vnto vs in the word of god and therefore wee may not curiously prie into it nor yet as some doe hence gather that seuen is a perfect number but from the consideration of the very time wherein the walles fell downe wee may learne this that if we would haue god to accomplish his promises vnto vs we must waite for that time amp season which he hath appointed we must not thinke that god wil accomplish them when we appoint but we must beleeue god promise and also waite his good leisure and then will it come to passe the israelites compassed about iericho one day and the walles neuer stirre yes they doe so sixe daies together and sixe times more on the seuenth day amp yet they stand fast the reason is because god appointed time was not yet come but on the seuenth day when they had compassed them about the seuenth time all the people gaue vp the showt amp then they fel down because that was the particular set time wherein god would accomplish his promise further whereas they compasse about the walles seuen daies together it must needes be that they went about them on the sabbaoth day for that was one of the seuen now here a doubt ariseth for this was a seruile worke vpon the sabbaoth contrary to god commandement which inioyned so strict a rest vpon the sabbaoth day that they might not kindle a fire thereon how then could they lawfully compasse the city on the sabbaoth day answer all god commandements in the morall lawe must be vnderstood with this exception thou shalt doe thus and thus vnlesse i the lord command thee otherwise for god is an absolute lord and so aboue the lawe and therefore may lawfully commaund that which the lawe forbiddeth in the second commandement he saith thou shalt not make to thy selfe any grauen image ampc and yet moses by god speciall appointment set vp a brasen serpent which was a figure of christ vpon such a speciall command abraham lawfully offers to kill isaac the israelites at their departure spoyle and robbe the egyptians and iosuah with the people here compasse the walles of iericho on the sabbaoth day by faith rahab the harlot perished not with them which obeyed not when shee had receiued the spies peaceably in this verse the holy ghost proceedes further in declaring the power of faith and for this ende commends vnto vs the faith of rahab the words contain the summe and abbridgement of the second and sixt chapters of iosua the meaning of them is plaine the points herein to be considered are three the person beleeuing to wit rahab the reward of her faith giuen by iosuah shee perished not but was preserued in the destruction of iericho the testimonie of her faith so called by saint iames chapter verse and set down in the end of this verse when shee had receiued the spies peaceably for the person rahab was a woman of canaan dwelling in iericho as wee may reade iosuah there shee liued and had her abode shee was no israelite but a forrainer in regard of her birth and a stranger from god church how then comes it to passe that she is commended for her faith and here put into the catalogue of these renowned beleeuers why are not the rest of the cananites preferred to this honour as well as shee answere wee must knowe this that from the beginning of the world to the time of christes ascension the church of god was small sometime shut vp in some fewe families as from the floud to the giuing of the law and after limited to a small kingdom and people in the land of canaan where the lord people dwelt during which time all other nation and people of the world besides this little company were no people of god but strangers from the couenant of promise and as pau saith without god in the world and howsoeuer god church was thus shut vp as it were in a corner yet now and then it pleased god to reach out his mercifull hand to some of the heathen calling them into his church and receiuing them into his couenant and they are called in the newe testament proselytes in abrahams family his bond man and servant were circumcised and made members of the church of god and in moses dayes iethro moses father in law a priest of midian obtained this at god hands to be ioyned vnto god church and so was ruth the moabite ruth and naaman the assyrian kings and as some think nabuchadonozer daniel but that is not so certaine and so was the eunuch of ethiopia candaces the queene of ethiopias chiefe gouernour acts now as god in mercy dealt with these so did he in like mercy call rahab the harlot aboue all the people of iericho for they trusted to their strong walls and therefore died but rahab beleeued that the god of israell was the true god and so had mercy shewed vnto her now after the time of christes ascension god dealt more bountifully with the world for he sent the light of his gospell into all nation and as the scripture saith their sound went through all the earth and their words to the ends of the world rom the consideration of this limited estate of the church of god for so long a time serues to discouer vnto vs the errour of those that maintaine and hold vniuersall calling of all and euery man to the state of grace and saluation but if that were so then in former ages the gentiles would haue beleeued whereas we see that before the ascension of christ the church of god was but a small remnant among the people of the iewes onely and not one of tenne thousand beleeued among the gentiles now if all man had beene effectually called then all would haue receiued the promise of the gospell but many nation in former ages neuer heard of christ and therefore there was neuer in all ages a generall effectuall calling of all man obiect paul saith god reconciled the world vnto himselfe by christ corinthian and if that be so then hee called all man effectually answer we must vnderstand the apostle according to his meaning for romans he expounds himselfe amp shewes what he meanes by the world saying that the falling away of the iewes is the reconciling of the world which cannot be vnderstoode of man in all the ages but in the last age of the world after christs ascension wherein god offered to all the world life euerlasting by christ further rahab is here noted by a notorious vice shee is called a harlot whereby shee was infamous among the man of iericho certaine of the iewes which are enemy to the new testament say that the author of this epistle and s iames doe great wrong vnto rahab for calling her an harlot for say they in iosuah shee is called but a tauerner or hostesse answer wee must knowe that the word which is vsed in iosuah signifieth two things a tauerner and an harlot now take the word properly as it is generally vsed in the olde testament and then most commonly it is put for an harlot and therefore in the new testament rahab hath no wrong done her by this title for it is the thing that iosuah intended to shew what a one shee had beene and therefore in speaking of her to the spies hee bids them goe into that harlots house iosuah vsing such an article as implies that shee had beene infamous and notorious in that kinde and yet we must not thinke that she playd the harlot after shee had receiued grace to beleeue but long before for faith purifieth the heart neither will it suffer any sinne to raigne therein she is called a harlot therefore in regard of her life past for which shee was infamous among the man of iericho before her calling to the faith quest how could she beleeue being a harlot in former times for it is said that neither fornicators nor adulterers shall inherite the kingdome of heauen corinthian answere that is true according to the law but the gospell giues this exception vnlesse they repent and so are all legall threatnings to be vnderstood in the word of god in this circumstance of the person and in the quality of her sinne we may note the endlesse mercy of god towards sinners for he hath vouchsafed to call most notorious and grieuous sinners to the state of saluation as isay saith the lord is very ready to forgiue isay yes with the lord is plentifull redemption psalm this appeares by vouchsafing mercy to rahab a notable harlot and as he dealeth with rahab here so hath he shewed like mercy to other notorious sinners king manasses had sold himselfe to idolatry and witchcraft and had shed innocent bloud exceeding much and caused iudah to sinne kings for which he was led captiue yet when he humbled himselfe and prayed god was intreated of him chronicle and paul saith of himselfe when he was a blasphemer and a persecuter and an oppresser he was receiued to mercy though he were the head of all sinners that christ might first shew on him all long suffering vnto the example of them which shall in time to come beleeue in him vnto euerlasting life tim the consideration of this exceeding mercy of god towards sinners is of great vse first it armeth a poore soule against despaire whereinto the diuell would draw it vpon the view of the multitude and greatnesse of his sinnes for many reason thus my sinnes are so haynous so many and so vile that i dare not come to god neither can i be perswaded of the pardon of them but behold heere the endlesse mercy of god in forgiuing sinnes to them that repent though they be like crimson and scarlet and neuer so many this must comfort the wounded soule and encourage all touched hearts to repent and to sue to the lord for mercy and pardon secondly it must moue euery one of vs now to begin to repent if we haue not repented heretofore and if wee haue begun to doe it more earnestly for god is most mercifull and with him is plentifull redemption yet wee must beware that we take not occasion heereby to liue in sinne because god is mercifull for this is to turne the grace of god into wantonnesse which saint iude makes a brand of the vngodly and a signe of the reprobate who as the apostle there saith are appointed to condemnation yes this is a despising of the bountifulnesse of god which should leade them to repentance and heereby they heape vp vnto themselues wrath against the day of wrath romanes chapter verses let vs therefore remember this counsell of paul shall wee sinne that grace may abound god forbid wee must all but especially young man take heede of this course for if wee blesse our selues in our heart and say wee shall haue peace though we liue in sinne god wil not be mercifull vnto vs but his wrath shall smoke against vs further note that howsoeuer shee was a sinner and a most infamous harlot yet when shee repents god doth honour and grace her with the title of a beleeuer and that among those most renowned beleeuers that euer liued before christ euen to be one of that cloude of witnesses in who faith is commended to the church for euer hence also it is that saint matthew reckons her in the genealogie of christ to be one of his predecessours when as amasia achas and such like who for ought wee knowe did neuer repent are not once named herein wee may see god wonderfull mercy in honouring sinners if they doe repent the consideration whereof must mooue vs not onely to learne the doctrine of repentance and to haue it in our mouthes but to labour that it may be settled in our hearts that wee may shewe forth the power thereof in our liues all of vs desire honour and reputation among m n well if wee would be honoured indeede wee must repent and then god himselfe will honour vs neither haue our sinnes made vs so infamous as by our repentance god shall make vs honourable further concerning the partie how could rahab come by faith seeing shee liued out of the church where the word was neuer preached vnto her answere if wee reade the storie wee shall finde that shee came to beleeue by a report of god meruailous acts for when the lord deliuered the israelites out of egypt through the red sea and drowned pharaoh therein with all his oast as they went further he deliuered the kings of the nation into their hands as og the king of baashan with the kings of the amorites and amalekites now the report heereof came to the people of iericho whereupon they were strik n with a wonderfull great feare and howsoeuer the man of iericho made no other vse of it but to arme and prepare themselues to resist and beate backe the israelites yet this report wrought further with rahab and therefore shee came to the spies whom shee had receiued and hid vpon the roofe of her house amp there confessed the god of israel to be the true god in heauen aboue and in the earth beneath here we may note that when ordinary meanes faile for the beginning and increase of faith as the word preached and the sacraments then god can worke faith extraordinarily euen by reports and rumors for thus rahab and many of the heathen came to beleeue we say of the church of rome that it is no true church and that their religion cannot saue a man hereupon many that sauour that way reply and say will you therefore condemne all your forefathers that liued and died in time of popery wee answer no we dare not giue such censure vpon them but rather iudge charitably of them yes wee haue great hope that many of them were saued for thogh they wanted preaching amp reading yet god might worke faith in them extraordinarily and blesse euen good reports and speeches vnto them with the reading of other godly bookes besides god word which some of them had we need not then giue so hard a censure of them because god is not tied to ordinary meanes but can saue extraordinarily when meanes faile further concerning rahabs faith it may be demanded whether it was weake or strong because before shee had done this fact of faith her whole abode was among the heathen answer wee must knowe that there is in the childe of god a certaine seede or beginning or preparation to a true and liuely faith which our sauiour christ in the scriptures doth honour with the title of a true amp liuely faith as when a man knowes no more but this that christ iesus is the true messias hauing withall a care and conscience to profit and increase in the true knowledge of the gospel and to ioyne practice therewith in his life and calling examples hereof wee haue many in god word a certaine ruler came to christ and besought him to goe downe amp heale his son ioh ampc iesus but said vnto him goe thy way thy son liueth and the ruler beleeued the word that iesus spake vnto him and his son liued now inquiring of the hower and finding it to be the same time when iesus said thy son liueth the text saith he beleeued and all his houshold now what was this mans faith surely he onely acknowledged that christ was the true messias and withall resigned himselfe and his family to be instructed further therein and though they knewe nothing particularly of the means wherby christ should be a sauiour yet for this willingnes in embracing christ and readinesse to be taught the holy ghost saith they did beleeue so in the same chapter verse the woman of samaria beeing conuicted in her conscience of the things that christ told her runnes into the towne and saith come see a man that hath told me all things that euer i did is not hee the christ then the text saith many of the samaritans beleeued because of the saying of the woman now what faith had these samaritans surely they did onely acknowledge him to be the true messias and were willing to bee further instructed in his doctrine which they testified by going to heare him in their owne persons so likewise christ giues a notable testimony to the confession of the apostles faith math in the person of peter saying thou article peter and vpon this rocke that is vpon this your faith which thou confessest will i build my church and yet the apostles were ignorant of some maine points of the gospel for a little after when christ tels them of his going to ierusalem and of his passion for the redemption of them and all the elect peter perswades him to the contrary saying master spare thy selfe these things shall not be vnto thee whereby it appeares that peter did not know how christ should be a sauiour neither did the apostles particularly knowe christ his resurrection till he was risen againe yes at the very time of his ascension they knew not the nature of christes kingdome and therefore they asked him lord wilt thou now restore the kingdome to israel acts dreaming still of a temporall kingdome for which christ rebukes them and notwithstanding all these wants christ saith they had true faith yes such faith as the gates of hell should neuer preuaile against this then is a most comfortable truth that if a man in the want of meanes of further knowledge doe hold christ iesus to be the true messias and yeeld himselfe willing to learne the doctrine of the gospell and withall ioyne obedience to his knowledge the lord is willing for a time to accept of this as of true faith now to apply this to rahabs faith her faith was but a weake faith or rather the seede and beginning of a liuely faith afterward for as we may reade all that shee knew was this that the god of israell was the onely true god and that hee would certainly deliuer the land of canaan into the israelites hands this was a notable perswasion wrought by a report and accordingly she ioynes her selfe to god people and resignes her selfe to obey the god of israel but whether she knew the particular doctrine of saluation by christ it is not here set down and it is very like that as yet she was altogether ignorant of it for heere are all things set down that tend to her commendation so that her faith was very weake and onely the seede of a liuely faith and yet heere the holy ghost doth commend her for her faith among the most renowned beleeuers that euer were hence we may learne many good instructions first that god makes much account of a little grace if he see in a man but the seed of grace he doth highly esteeme therof when the young man came to christ and asked him what he should doe to be saued christ tells him hee must keepe the commaundements the young man answeres that he had kept them from his youth at which answere it is said christ looked vpon him and loued him this he he did for the shew of grace which appeared in his answer much more then wil he like of that which is true grace indeede so likewise christ reasoning with the scribe concerning the first and great commandement and perceiuing that he had answered discreetly he said vnto him thou article not farre from the kingdome of god mark shewing hereby how deeply hee tenders the sparks and seedes of true grace nay hee makes much of a very shew of grace which if it be so then if god haue giuen to any of vs but one spark of true grace how ought wee to tender it and cherish it and to reioyce therein with all thankfulnes to god for it yes wee must seek to encrease the same for according to our grace is our acceptance and respect with god in christ secondly whereas rahabs weake faith is thus commended here is comfort for all those that are willing to learne god word and to obay the same many are willing to learne but they are so wonderfully troubled with dulnesse and want of memory that they cannot learne and hereupon they grow to doubt much of their estate towards god but these me must cofort themselues for though they haue but little knowledge yet if they haue care to encrease in knowledge amp make coscience of obedience to so much as they know god wil account of the as of true beleeuers amp in truth such are to be comeded aboue those which haue much knowledge amp so seeme to haue much faith and yet shew forth no obedience answerable to their knowledge for they haue a shew of godlines but want the power of it thirdly this confuteth our ignorant boasters who say they haue as much knowledge as any man needs to haue for they knowe that a man must loue god aboue all amp that christ iesus is the sauiour of the world amp this say they is enough and hereupon they take vp their rest for matters of religion amp seek to go no further but these man know nothing at all for if they would ad to this which they know though it be but little a care to encrease in knowledge amp with their knowledge ioin obediece the it were somthing but whiles they haue no care neither to get more knowledge nor to shew forth obedience to that they knowe they do heereby shew plainly that there is no drop of sauing knowledge nor true faith in their hearts fourthly seeing god commends the seedes of true faith for true faith indeede this must encourage all man to vse all good meanes to come by true faith and repentance for though as yet thou hast but little knowledge and therefore but little faith and repentance yet if thou ioyne hereto an endeuour to get more knowledge and haue also care to practice that which thou knowest then will the lord encrease thy knowledge and thy small faith till thou haue sufficient and in the meane time accept of thee as a true beleeuer and thus much for the measure of rahabs faith the second point to be considered is the reward which rahab receiued at the hands of ioshua and the israelites for her faith shee perished not with them that obeyed not that is she with her family was preserued aliue when as iosuah destroyed all that liued in iericho young and olde man woman and childe but some will say the israelites were the people of god a religious people now it may seeme to be a cruell part to destroy all for what had the young infants done answer in mans reason it may seeme so indeede yet it could not be a cruell part because they did no more then that which god commaunded them for it was god ordinance that the canaanites should be rooted out and that the israelites should shew no compassion on them deut besides euen in reason the israelites had some cause to deale thus for god gaue this charge to the israelites that when they came to any citie or people first they must offer peace and if they answered pea eably then they must be saued and become their tributaries and servant deuteronomie but if they would not make peace then they must put them to the edge of the sword verse man woman and childe being inhabitant of canaan or neere adioyning and thus no doubt ioshua dealt when he came to iericho first he offered peace if they would become their tributaries but they trusted to their strong walls and would not yeeld to become their servant for which cause he put them all to the edge of the sword and therefore it was no cruelty because it was god commaundement for god will is the rule of iustice but was not this partiall dealing to spare rahab with her family who were inhabitant of iericho as well as the rest answer there were two causes why shee should escape first because shee yeelded her selfe to the people of israell and ioyned her selfe vnto them and was content to become one of their religion and therefore the comaundement of putting all to death did not take holde of her secondly rahab obtained this of the spies and bound them to it by an oath that when they came to destroy iericho they should spare her and her family and therefore also did she escape in this preseruation of rahab wee may learne sundry points first whereas she is saued aliue because of the oath of the spies wee see what speciall care euery one ought to haue for the doing of those lawful things whatsoeuer they are whereto he bindes himselfe by an oath ioshua knowing this bond of the spies to rahab as we may reade giues speciall charge for her preseruation hence dauid saith if a man binde himselfe with an oath he must keepe it though it be to his owne hinderance psalm euery single promise bindes a mans conscience if it be lawful but when an oath is adioyned then there is a double bond and therefore the author to the hebrewes saith that god to make knowen the stablenesse of his counsell promised bound himselfe with an oath that by two immutable things to wit god promise and oath we might haue strong consolation so that an oath binds a man double to the performing of his promise and that this conscience is to be made of a lawful oath appeareth thus if a man make a lawful oath and yet bee induced to doe it by fraud he must perform it and not faile as appeareth by iosuahs facte to the gibeonites iosuah for when they came to the iewes craftily as though they had beene man of a farre country and had brought them to sweare that they would not hurt them though the hoast of israel murmured at it when they came to their cities and though they might haue reasoned thus that they got it of them by fraud and therefore they would not keepe it yet this is the answer of iosuah and the princes vnto the people that they had sworne vnto them by the lord god of israel and therefore they might not touch them and when king saul in zeale to israel had broken this oath of iosuah and the princes by destroying the gibeonites sam there came a plague vpon the land for three yeares space and was not staied till seauen of sauls sonnes were hanged for sauls fact so that the breach of an oath is a most dangerous thing and therefore he that hath bound himselfe thereby must haue great care to keep it yet here some cases may be propounded worthy our consideration for first what if a man haue taken an oath to doe an vnlawful thing must he then keep his oath ans if his conscience tell him out of god word that the thing is not lawful then he must not keep it for an oath may not be the bond of iniquitie the keeping of it is a doubling of the sin dauid in his anger had sworn to slay nabal and all the man in his family for denying reliefe vnto his servant sam this was a rash oath and therfore afterward when hee was preuented by abigails good counsell hee blesseth god for it and breakes his oath which hee had made verse quest what if a man take an oath and yet afterward in consciece doubts of the lawfulnes of that which he hath sworne to do what must be don in this case ans so long as he doubteth hee must defer the performace of it for he that doth a thing doubtingly condemnes himselfe in the thing he doth because he doth it not of faith and whatsoeuer is not of faith is sinne rom quest what if a man be vrged by feare to take an oath must hee afterward keepe it as for example a man is taken of theeues now wanting money they charge him on paine of death to fetch them money and they binde him hereto by an oath what must bee done in this case considering there must such great care bee had in keeping of an oath answer so long as the thing which hee is bound by oath to doe respecteth his priuate dammage onely he must keep his oath yet so as he declare his case to the magistrate because their course is against the common good now the magistrate hearing of it is according to equity to prouide for his defence amp for the safety of his goods a second point to be considered in rahabs preseruation is this rahab escaped a common danger but not without all meanes onely staying her selfe on the bare promise of the spies but as shee beleeued in the true god so shee vsed meanes whereby shee might bee sure of her preseruation and that is this shee bindes the spies by an oath to saue her life and to spare her houshold also shee keepes within and ties the corde of red threed in her windowe according to their mutuall couenant thus shee vseth meanes for her temporall safety and so haue other of god children done in like case when king hezekiah kings was sicke hee was certified by the prophet from god that hee should liue fifteene yeares longer yet hee neglected not the meanes whereby he should be healed and liue for hee applied dry figges to his byle and vsed foode and raiment for his bodily life during the whole space of those fifteene yeares so the apostle s paul in his voyage by sea to rome was assured by a vision that none of them that were with him should perish but all come safe to land and yet when the mariners would haue gone out hee tels the centurion that vnlesse those staied in the ship that so they might vse the ordinary means they could not be safe now as it fareth temporally for the saving of the body so is it in the spirituall case for the salvation of the soule man must vse means to come by grace amp so to salvation but many in this regard be great enemy to their owne soules they say god is mercifull and christ is a saviour amp i hope he will saue me yet they wil not vse the means to come to saluation but if we would be saued the with our inward faith we must ioyn the obseruatio of the outward ordinary means whereby god vseth to saue mens soules as namely the hearing of god word calling vpon god by prayer and the receiuing of the sacraments that thereby our sinfull lyues may bee amended and our faith strengthened this must bee remembred of vs for they that contemne or neglect the means despise the grace and mercy of god offered therein and therfore paul saith of the iewes when they put the gospel from them that they did iudge themselues vnworthy eternall life act it followeth with them that disobeyed that is with the people of iericho quest how did they disobey ans thus when iosuah and the people came vnto them and offered them peace if so be they would becom their tributaries and servant the inhabitant of iericho would not yield vnto the but set themselues against the people of israel and so against god in that they would not vndertake that estate which god offered vnto them and therefore they are here esteemed disobedient hence we learne that if it shall please god at any time to put vs out of these temporary benefits which we enioy in goods and possessions wee must bee contented with god will and prouidence and seeke to obey god therein the inhabitant of iericho pay deerely for their disobedience in this case god sets the israelites as lord over them and because they will not yield to become their servant they die for it dauids practice was commendable in this case for when he was put out of his owne kingdom by his owne son hee murmured not but said thus if i shall finde fauour in the eies of the lord he will bring me againe but if he say thus i haue no delight in thee beholde here i am let him doe to me as seemeth good in his eies sam in other country we see cities and townes spoyled and sacked what must the people doe answer they must submit themselues to the lord pleasure knowing that he permitteth it who may doe what he will and so if it shall please god to bring vs into the like case as to suffer our enemy to haue dominion ouer vs and to dispossesse vs of our places we must submit our selues to god good pleasure when wee see no helpe by lawful meanes wee must not murmure or rebell for that is but to disobey as the people of iericho did and so shall we be destroyed as they were and thus much for the second point the third thing to be considered in this example is the testimony of her faith in receiuing the spies peaceably this was a notable worke of faith as saint iames noteth iam and the more commendable because shee receiued them into her house and entertained them yes shee preserued them in danger of her owne life for shee did it contrary to the pleasure of the state vnder which shee liued but against this may be obiected first that shee lyed in this fact for when the king of iericho s messengers came to search for the spies whom shee had hid in the top of her house shee said to the messengers they were gone another way now how can it bee a good worke which was don with lying especially to our superior who hath power to aske vs and to whom wee are double bound to speake the truth answer wee must knowe that the worke was good which shee did and a worke of mercy to preserue god people although shee failed in the manner of doing it shee receiued them by faith though shee shewed distrust in lying for their safetie it was a notable worke of rebecca gen to cause her son iacob to get his fathers blessing for so god had determined and yet shee failed in the manner quest but how could this worke be good being faulty in the manner of doing it ans it might for rebeccas person stood righteous before god in christ now the worker beeing acceptable vnto god the worke must needs be good also and though the worker failed in the circumstances yet the euill of the worke was couered in the obedience of christ and so the goodnes of it was approoued and the fault thereof couered the vse of this doctrine is two folde first it shews that the works of god children are partly good and partly bad euen the best works they doe are imperfect secondly this shewes the true meaning of saint iames when hee saith that rahab was iustified by her works hereby he means that by her works she declared her selfe to be iust for that shee was not iustified by her works appeareth plaine because the worke which shee did was faulty in the manner and not perfectly good and therfore could not be answerable to the perfect iustice of god but some will further say that this concealing of the spies and lying to the kings messengers was a worke of treachery against her owne country and therefore was a notorious fault and so no worke of faith answer treachery indeed is as great villany as one man can practice against another and therefore ought to bee abhorred and detested of all man but yet wee must knowe that rahab in this place is no traytor for she had a plaine certificat in her conscience that the land of canaan and the citie iericho were giuen by the lord to the people of israel and that they were the right lord thereof and should enioy them so that she hid the spies not in treachery but in faith thus wee see her facte the duties which wee learne hence are these first it is said that this harlot rahab beeing by calling an hostesse and a victualler receiued the spies peaceably hence inn keepers are taught their dutie first if they will shew themselues faithfull they must haue special regard and respect vnto such guests of theirs as be the servant of god and feare him this was the worke of rahabs faith towards the spies of god people dauid makes this the property of euery godly man that in his eyes a vile person is contemned but hee honoureth them that feare the lord psalme verse and therefore if inn keepers will shewe themselues godly they must so doe and to encourage each one heereto our sauiour christ makes this notable promise matthew chapter verse hee that receiueth a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receiue a prophets reward and hee that receiueth a iust man in the name of a iust man shall receiue a iust mans reward and if any shall giue to one of these little ones to drinke a cuppe of colde water onely in the name of a disciple verily i say vnto you hee shall not lose his reward also strangers are heere taught that in seeking places for their abode they must make choyse to bee with those that feare the lord so god directs these spies to doe and when christ sent his disciples to preach he bade them mathew chapter verse when they entred into a citie to enquire who is worthy in that citie and there to abide till they departed but alas these duties are little performed especially the first for inn keepers and such as entertaine strangers doe make most of those that giue themselues to ryote and good fellow hip they are best welcom that spend most in gaming drink and lasciuiousnesse these might learne otherwise of rahab who did better though she had beene an harlot thirdly in keepers must here learne that when a man comes into their house if he be no malefactor they must giue him protection thus rahab doth heere to the spies of the israelites euen with the danger of her owne life the like also we may reade of lot for when two angels in the likenesse of man came into his house and the man of sodome would haue had them out lot besought them to let them alone gen and his reason is because they came vnder the shadow of his roofe againe hence we may learne another generall duty to wit that a christian man in the time of persecution amp danger is not to discouer his fellow brother or to detect them but must rather indanger his owne life by concealing them for their preseruation this was practiced by good obadiah when iesabel killed the lord prophets he hid them by fifties in a caue which if it had been knowen would haue cost him his life and so did the apostles and brother in the primitiue church when the iewes would haue slaine paul in damascus the brother tooke him by night and let him downe through the wall in a basket to saue his life acts and since those times in the history of the church vnder the gospell wee may finde that when the christians were vrged by persecuters to reueale their brother they rather chose to lay down their owne lyues then to betray their brethre into their enemy hands and this is true loue indeede such as the holy ghost commendeth when a man will giue his life for his brother john lastly whereas rahab receiued the spies peaceably wee note that it is a speciall fruite of faith to be peaceable and kinde the holy ghost repeating the fruites of the spirit names peace and meeknesse among them now this peace is when a man is kinde and peaceable to all but especially to those that e of the houshold of faith and vndoubtedly it is a fruite of faith which the prophet isay fore told should be vnder the gospel isay that then the wolfe should dwell with the lamb and the leopard lie with the kid signifying that howsoeuer man by nature were as savage as wolues yet beeing conuerted to the kingdome of christ they should become gentle as lambs being kinde and peaceable one to another this peaceablenesse is especially to be shewed in the place and calling where a man liues for there did rahab shew forth hers when the spies came vnto her and where this is truly in outward action there is faith in the heart it is a good token that a man is at peace with god when he liues peaceably with man which being so we must learne not to giue place to our heady affections but must rather bridle the rage of malice and anger and endeuour to liue peaceably with all especially with those that be members of god church and thus much of this example and what shall i say more for the time would be too short for me to tell of gedeon of barac and of samson and of iephte also of dauid and samuel and of the prophets which through faith subdued kingdomes wrought righteousnesse ampc hitherto the author of this epistle hath set down vnto vs examples of faith more at large but from this verse to the end of this chapter he heapes vp briefely together many examples of faith one vpon another the reason whereof is first because the number of true beleeuers which are mentioned in scripture is very great and therefore he could not here stand to set them downe in order one by one secondly by handling all the examples at large which the author propoundeth in this short epistle hee should haue seemed to haue restrained the name and title of faith to a very few for all that are here named and commended for their faith are but few in comparison of all that truely beleeued in the olde testament and therefore hee heapes vp the rest together to intimate that the number of beleeuers was more than he could record and this hee doth by a rhetoricall preterition or passing ouer called in schooles paralepsis whereby matters are briefly dispatched and passed ouer with the very naming only what shall i say more that is as if hee had said i haue propounded diverse worthy examples of faith and besides these there are also many more but the time of writing an epistle will not suffer me to handle them all at large first in this particular quicke dispatch of beleeuers by our apostle wee may obserue a difference betweene the infinite vnderstanding of god and the created vnderstanding that is in mans minde man indeed vnderstands the things that are reuealed to him of god but yet in a manner and order farre different from that which is in god for man cannot conceiue in his minde all the things hee knowes at once by one acte of his vnderstanding but must haue distinct time to conceiue of them one by one distinctly for looke as he vtters them distinctly one by one as we see in this place so likewise doth he apprehend them in conceit and vnderstanding but with god it is not so for god at once by one acte of vnderstanding without distinction of time doth conceiue of all things at once both past present and to come and so could vtter and expresse them if any creature were able in conceit so to comprehend them secondly whereas the holy ghost saith the time would be too short ampc hee giues vs to vnderstand that the number of beleeuers is very great and that a long time would not serue to repeat them or to write of them this directeth vs vnto a good answer to a question which much troubleth our common people to wit how great is the number of them that shall be saued whether is it greater than the number of them that shal be damned ans we must consider the nuber of the elect wais in coparison of them that shall be condemned secondly in themselues if we compare the elect with the reprobate the number of the elect is but a small nuber for in most ages the church of god hath beene but a handfull to the rest of the world and in the church this likewise is true many are called but few chosen in respect of them that are called but yet consider the elect as they are in themselues and they are a huge great number yes innumerable as saint john saith speaking of the elect among the gentiles beside the chosen iewes for all that doe truely beleeue shall bee saued now beleeuers are innumerable this the author of this epistle would insinuate vnto vs by his phrase of speech what shall i say more ampc in handling these examples wee must obserue the order here vsed by the holy ghost for in this verse hee sets down the names of the persons that beleeue all ioyntly together rehearsing them one by one and in the verses he laies downe briefly the fruits of all their faith in number tenne most notable actions seruing all and euery one of them most worthily to commend their faith in the handling of them wee will follow the order obserued by the holy ghost and first speake of the persons then of their actions the foure first are these gedeon barac samson and iephte these foure were iudges in israel the fift is dauid who was both a prophet and a king the sixt is samuel both a iudge and a prophet lastly the prophets generally by whom wee must vnderstand especially these three elijah eliseus and daniel in speaking of these persons here commended vnto vs first we will intreate of them generally and then in particular in generall let vs first obserue the order which the holy ghost here vseth in naming them gedeon for time was after barac and yet here he is first named so samson was after iephte and yet here he is put before him this the holy ghost would neuer doe without some special cause we therefore must knowe that the scripture vseth a two fold order in reckoning vp of persons to wit the order of time when as hee that liued first is first named and the order of dignity when the most worthy and excellent is named first though he were later in time now the scripture accounteth best of them that did excell in faith and in the fruits thereof so in this place whereas gedeon is set before barac amp samson before iephte the holy ghost obserues not the order of time but the order of dignity according to the excellency of their faith naming them in the first place that were most famous for this grace of faith and did exceed the other in the fruits thereof here we learne this speciall point that the more man excell in faith and other graces of god the more god will honour them for looke who most honour god shall be most honoured of him but the more a man excels in grace the more he honours god and for this cause is gedeon preferred before barac and samson before iephte because they were more plentifull in the fruits of faith this must mooue vs not onely to seeke to haue faith but to labour euery day more and more for the increase of faith and of obedience for the more a man abounds in grace before god the more will god honour him both here and in heauen and thus much for the order wherein they are propounded secondly let vs consider what manner of persons these were gedeon barac and the rest they were extraordinary man in their time raised vp by god for the speciall good of his church and the common wealth of the iewes that they might help and defend them in distresse and therefore as their calling was extraordinary so god indued them with extraordinary gifts of wisdome strength zeale and authority for which they are here renowmed in this catalogue of most worthy beleeuers in their example wee may obserue this point that whom god doth raise vp extraordinarily for some speciall good in his church them he endues with extraordinarie gifts to discharge that calling and withall hee giues them the spirit of grace with a true and liuely faith this besides the instance we haue in hand appeares plainly in christes apostles they were called by christ to preach the gospell to all the world and to plant his church vniuersally and thereupon howsoeuer they were simple man before were furnished with extraordinary gifts of wisedome zeale amp knowledge and with this excellent grace of sauing faith which did sanctifie their other gifts for howsoeuer iudas was numbred among them hauing been a disciple yet he neuer came to the execution of the apostleship but went astray from that ministration acts and in these later dayes when god restored his gospell to light out of the darke myst of popery hee raised vp extraordinarie man whom he endued with wisedome zeale and iudgement which gifts also he sealed vp in them by a liuely faith which they testified by their piety and godlinesse in life amp conuersation and this course he obserueth vsually in all those whom hee raiseth vp extraordinarily for the good of his church this we must obserue to acquaint vs with a special difference betweene those whom god raiseth vp extraordinarily for speciall good and all arch heretiques and traytors that set vp themselues vnsent of god for many such wretches haue excelled in wisedome in worldly policy in zeale and authority whereupon they haue pretended and perswaded many that they were called of god but hereby especially they are to be discouered that they are voide of this rare gift of true sauing faith for look at their lyues and ordinarily for impiety they haue beene and are arch diuels so that though they wanted not authority or outward zeale and wisedome yet they wanted faith which should purifie their hearts or else they would neuer haue liued in such notorious sinnes as they were discouered to doe and this is the triall which our sauiour christ directs vs vnto saying ye shall knowe them by their fruites math let them therefore pretend what knowledge what zeale or authority soeuer they will if the fruits of faith appeare not in their lyues by obedience they are not called of god for the speciall good of his church thus much of these man in generall now wee come to entreate of them seuerally as they are propounded in the text the first person here commended vnto vs is gedeon the history of whose acts is laid down at large iudges chap in his example note one point especially to acquaint vs with the manner which god vseth in begetting and encreasing true faith in the hearts of his children if we reade the story we shal see that the lord in the likenesse of an angel called gedeon once twice yes thrice to be a iudge to his people but gedeo greatly doubts of his calling amp therefore desires a signe of the lord which god gaue him for the sacrifice which he offered was burned vp with fire from heauen yet still hee doubted and was in a greater feare then before euen of death it selfe but being confirmed by the angell and set a worke he brake down the altar of baall and built one to the true god and thereon offered sacrifice as god commaunded though with some feare and when the midianites and amalekites came armed against israell hee is stirred vp by the spirit of god for their defence but yet still hee doubted of his calling and therefore againe asked a signe at god hands and had it and after that asked another which god also graunted nowe hauing all these one in the necke of another at length hee knowes his calling and so goes in faith and defends israell so that hee got the assurance of his calling by sundry particular signes and confirmations of his faith and though hee doubted greatly at the first yet after hee beleeues not onely that hee should bee a iudge and deliuerer of god people out of the hands of their enemy but this principally that god was his god and would giue vnto him euerlasting life here then we haue a notable precedent of the manner of god working true and sound faith in the hearts of his children they receiue not this grace at once but by degrees god works it in them by little and little when a man is first called of god hee hath much doubting and feare but then god sends sundry helpes to weaken this feare and doubting and as they decrease so is faith encreased no man beleeues soundly at the first but weakely euen as he growes in yeares so he must grow in faith and the encrease of our faith is by continuance in the meanes and by experience of god loue and fauour and indeed the more faith encreaseth the more wee vse the meanes to grow therein and the more we delight in the meanes and at length after long experience of god mercy wee shall haue wrought in our hearts this gift of true amp liuely faith which shall be able to preuaile against all feare and doubting and thus much for the person of gedeon the second person commended vnto vs is barac of whom wee may reade iudges his storie is large and plaine enough and therefore wee will not stand vpon it the third person is samson of whom wee may also reade iudges ampc now touching samson this question may well be asked how hee can be iustly commended for his faith seeing it may seeme hee killed himselfe answere samson did not kill himselfe for hee was called extraordinarily to be a iudge ouer israell for their defence and deliuerie out of the hands of the philistimes now when the princes of the philistimes were gathered together being his enemy and the enemy of god and his people hee cast the house downe vpon their heads to kill them therein because beeing blinde hee could not pursue them in battaile and therefore hauing them by god prouidence in his hands hee destroyed them as his calling was albeit hee lost his owne life in the same action againe samson in pulling downe the house purposed not directly and wilfully to kill himselfe but to adventure his owne life by taking iust reuenge vpon his enemy and the enemy of god and therefore as god servant he prayed first vnto god and so did no more tha the souldier in the field ought to doe who bearing a louing minde towards his countrey is content to adventure his owne life for the destruction of his enemy in the defence of his countrey and is resolued that if hee die in that defence hee dieth in his lawful place and calling and dieth god servant yes god champion this did samson and therefore may iustly be commended for his faith neither is this fact of his any disgrace but rather a notable commendation of his faith and an euidence of great zeale for god glory and of singular loue to his people the fourth person commended heere is iephte of whom wee may reade iudges iephte was the base son of gilead borne of an harlot to be base borne is noted in scripture as a matter of reproach and therefore the lord forbade a bastard to enter into the congregation of the lord to beare any office vnto the tenth generation deuteronomie chapter verse so ignominious is this kinde of birth by the iudgement of god spirit vnto that party on whom it falls for this sinne of fornication doth not onely hurt the persons committing it but euen staines the children base borne to the tenth generation yet howsoeuer iephte was base borne and so suffered for it great reproach heere wee see hee is commended vnto vs for his faith among the most worthy beleeuers that euer were indeede besides iephte wee shall not finde the like example in scripture yet in iephte wee may see that howsoeuer it be a reproachfull thing to be borne of fornication yet that doth not hinder but the party so borne may come to true faith and so to the fauour of god and to life euerlasting such persons as are base borne vpon viewe of that reproach which the scripture fasteneth vpon them might take occasion to thinke miserably of themselues even that god had reiected them but this example serues to shewe that it hindereth not but that they may come into the fauour of god and by faith get honor of god to countervaile that discredit which they haue by their base birth further whereas wee commonly say that such as are base borne are wicked persons here wee see the contrary in iephte and therefore wee must not for this cause condemne any for wicked or vngodly indeed the lord hath branded this estate with reproach that man should shun the sinne of fornication the more againe whereas iephte is here commended for his faith we may probably gather that their opinion is not true who hold that iephte sacrificed amp killed his owne daughter for beeing commended here for his faith certain it is he had knowledge in god will and word and therefore we must not thinke but that he knewe god would neuer accept of such a vowe by the performance whereof hee should commit wilfull and most vnnaturall murder this his faith shewes that it was not his intent to kill the first person that met him out of his house for by the light of nature hee might know that god would neuer accept thereof and therefore it is not like he so made his vow for this faith and such a vow cannot stand together but some will say the text is plaine iudg that he vowed to offer for a burnt offer the thing that cam out of the doores of his house to meet him when he came home ans it is so indeed in some translations it shall be the lord and i wil offer it ampc but the words in the originall may as well bee translated thus it shall bee the lord or i will offer it ampc and this later translation is more sutable to the circumstances of the place for this was iephtes meaning that whatsoeuer met him first he would dedicate it to god amp if it were a thing that might bee sacrificed then his purpose was to offer it vnto the lord in sacrifice quest but if he did not kill her why did he then so lament for her ans because by his vowe he was to dedicate her to god and so shee was to liue a nazarite all her life long which must needs be a very bitter thing to him who had no childe but her it beeing so great a reproach and in some sort a curse in those daies to want issue i speake not here how well or ill iephte did in making her a nazarite but this may no way bee admitted that beleeuing and godly iephte should aduisedly kill his owne daughter vndoubtedly hee could not thinke that god would bee pleased with such an abhominable sacrifice thus much for these persons the rest i passe ouer because this story is plaine and large in scripture which th ough faith subdued kingdoms wrought righteousnesse obtained the promises stopped the mouthes of lions quenched the violence of fire escaped the edge of the sword of weake were made strong waxed valiant in battell turned to flight the armies of the aliants the woman receiued their dead raised to life in these wordes the apostle propounds vnto vs ten seueral fruits of faith the nine first whereof are the particular actions of the parties spoken of in the former verse and they are here related for the commendation of their faith the first is subduing of kingdomes which serues chiefly for the commendation of the faith of the foure iudges there named and of dauid for as wee may read in the bookes of iudges and of samuel all these subdued kingdoms as the canaanites iudg the midianites iudg the philistims iudg and sam the ammonites iudg moabites amp aramites sam now how did they ouercome and subdue them the text saith by faith which wee must not not thus vnderstand as though onely by the very acte of faith they subdued kingdoms but the meaning of the holy ghost is that they beleeued the promises which god made vnto them of deliuering these kingdomes into their hands and according to their faith god accomplished his promises vnto them and so they subdued kingdomes by faith in this worke of faith we may learne two things first that it is lawful for christians in the newe testament to make war for that which may be done in faith is lawful for god servant but war may bee made in faith for these servant of god subdue kingdomes in war and that by faith and therefore it is lawful for christians vpon iust cause to make war the anabaptists of germany say it is not lawful for a christian vnder the gospel to carry a weapon or to make war but this one place of scripture if there were no moe is alone sufficient to prooue the lawfulnesse of war vnder the gospel if it be vsed according to god will amp word when the souldiers came to john baptist and asked him what they should doe hee bids them not leaue off their calling but this do violence to no man neither accuse any falsly and be content with your wages luke and our sauiour christ reporteth of a centurion which was captaine of a band when he came to haue his son healed that hee had not found such faith in israel and hee was not a centurion onely afore he beleeued but euen afterward when christ commended his faith yet did he not dislike his calling the like may be said of cornelius act all which shew plainely that vpon iust causes christians may lawfully make war ob but to defend their opinio they obiect som places of scripture as mat resist not euill saith christ therefore say they a man may not wear a weapon nor vse a sword lest those make him to resist and so to breake this commandement of christ ans that place must bee vnderstood of priuat reuenge and so it maketh nothing against lawful war for what though a priuate man may not reuenge himselfe nor make war yet that hindereth not but that a magistrate who beares the sword may lawfully vse it againe it is friuolous to imagine that resisting is onely by a weapon for the chiefe resistance that god respecteth is in the heart and affection and a priuat man may resist that is breake this commandement by vnlawful resistance though he carry no weapon and the publike person breake it not though he make war obiect secondly they obiect the prophecy of isay who speaking of the kingdome of christ vnder the gospel saith that then they shall turne their swords into scithes and their spears into mattocks therfore say they there must be no war vnder the gospel ans that prophecy signifies that in christs kingdom there must be great loue and peace amp wonderfull concord among all the true servant of god but here they take aduantage amp say if this be so what then needeth any war ans we must knowe that as there bee two kindes of kingdomes a spirituall kingdome and a politicke so there be two kindes of peace spirituall and politicke spirituall peace is inward in the church and politicke peace is outward in the common wealth spirituall peace i begun and preserued by spirituall meanes of grace in the ministery of the church but war is an ordinary meanes for the establishing and preseruing of politicke peace secondly hence wee learne that god people may make war not onely by way of defence but also in assault vpon their enemy amp that according to god word for here it is said that gedeon sampson dauid amp the rest by faith subdued kingdoms making war against them by way of assault and not in defence onely indeede speciall care ought to bee had that offensiue war in assaulting an enemie be made vpon iust amp good grounds one speciall ground or cause is heere implied in this worke of faith to wit the recouery of iust right in matters of importance for the kingdoms of canaan were giuen to the israelites by god himselfe and for the recouery of them they made war by way of assault so when lot was taken captiue by keder laomer amp the kings of the nation abraham lots kinsman gathers his servant together and pursues the kings and ouertaking them destroyed them for the recouerie of lot and his goods other respects there be for which offensiue war in assault may be made but because they are not heere mentioned i will not propound them the second fruite of their faith is this they wrought righteousnesse that is some of these man in their places wherein god had set them gaue to euery man his owne this working of righteousnesse consists in two things first in giuing rewards to such as deserued them secondly in inflicting due punishment according to mens deserts in both these the man before named did all excell but especially two of them dauid and samuel for dauid it is a wonder to see how righteous he was for when he was anointed king in sauls steed and saul reiected how did hee behaue himselfe towards saul did hee seeke sauls blood no but when saul hunted him as the hunter doth the partridge dauid euen then gaue himselfe to studie and practice righteousnesse yes when saul was fallen into his hands both in the caue and asleepe in the campe samuel chapter verses ampc and chapter verses he would not touch him nor suffer others to doe him hurt because hee was the lord anointed yes so righteous was dauid towards saul that his heart smote him for cutting off but the lappe of his coate therefore dauid is heere commended especiallie for this effect of faith the working of righteousnesse to apply this vnto our times if this be a fruite of faith thus to worke righteousnesse then what may be saide of the church of rome and of the popish sort among vs they pretend the auncient faith and none must be so good beleeuers and catholikes as they but how doe they shewe this their faith is it by the practice of righteousnesse doe they giue to euery one his due nay verily but they set themselues to worke the ruine of kingdomes that ioyne not with them in religion this witnesse their manifolde amp diuellish plots against our state from time to time this did not dauid no not against saul though hee were reiected of god and also most vniustly sought his death but they haue many times sought the death of the lord anointed ouer vs whereby they declare their state to all the world that they haue no sparke of true faith at all for true faith will make a man practice righteousnesse and innocencie and therefore we may iudge of them and all their adherents that be of this mind to allow such practices that they haue none other but y e faith of diuels which is to beleeue the word of god to be true this the diuels do with trembling and as their faith is diuellish so are the fruites thereof namely treachery and falshood such as the diuel most approues but we must learne that true faith is especially commended by these fruites the study and practice of innocence and the maintaining of peace in christian estates for true faith and treachery and contention wil no more stand together than light and darknesse secondly samuel also wrought righteousnesse as appeareth by his protestatio before all israel whe he gaue vp his office of gouernment ouer them vnto saul sam behold saith hee heere am i beare record of mee before the lord and before his anointed whose oxe haue i taken or whose asse haue i taken or whom haue i done wrong to or whom haue i hurt or of whose hand haue i receiued any bribe to blinde mine eyes therewith and i will restore it now as these two samuel and dauid were famous for this fruite of faith in working righteousnesse so likewise were the iudges and prophets before named in their places carefull of this vertue and did practice the same partly in rewarding the good and partly in punishing the wicked but some will say to worke righteousnesse cannot be a fruit of faith for the very heathen which neuer heard of christ by the light of nature haue done iustice and are highly commended by heathen writers for the same now that which the heathen can doe by the light of nature is not thus to be extolled as a fruite of faith answer true it is the heathen haue done many workes of iustice but we must wisely consider that euery iust worke is not a fruite of faith vnlesse it be done by a righteous person in obedience to god and for his glory but in all these the heathen failed in their workes for though the things they did were good in themselues yet seeing the heathen were corrupt trees remaining in the sinfull state of corrupt nature their workes must needes be corrupt fruite as coming from them for an euill tree cannot bring forth good fruit the heart is the fountain of euery action now their hearts were corrupt being destitute of faith which purifies the heart and therefore their workes must needes be sinfull againe they did not their workes in obedience for they were guided onely by the light of nature and knew not god aright nor his commaundements and lastly they propounded not the glory of god as the end of their workes but the praise of man their owne profit or some such end but these worthy persons doe not onely such things as were iust in themselues but they doe them in faith in obedience and for god glory and so please god now seeing these renowned princes and iudges haue their faith commended vnto vs by their practicing of righteousnesse we must learne to follow them within the compasse of our calling doing iustice and righteousnesse in such things as cocerne vs there be many reasons set down in god word to perswade vs heereunto as first for this end hath god caused the gospell to be published tit the sauing grace of god hath appeared but to what end to teach vs that we should denie vngodlinesse and liue soberly and righteously that is that wee might doe iustice vnlesse therefore we worke righteousnesse we make the gospel a vaine word vnto vs secondly we desire to be counted iust before god and man and it would grieue vs if we should be otherwise thought of but if wee would be iust indeede both before god and man then we must work righteousnesse for as s john saith he that doth righteousnesse is righteous thirdly there is no man set ouer a family but he either doth or ought to endeuour to bring a blessing vpon his family but this he cannot doe vnlesse he worke righteousnesse and doe iustice for salomon saith he that walketh in his integrity is iust and blessed shall his children be after him lastly we doe all of vs desire to escape hell well then we must remeber to practice righteousnes for the apostle saith no vnrighteous ma that is none practicing vnrighteousnes shall enter into the kingdom of heauen so that within the compasse of our calling we must all endeuour to do iustice here some will aske how shall i do iustice and worke righteousnesse answer for the doing of it wee must remember to practice these rules that follow that which is both the word of god and the rule of nature we must do to all man as we would they should do vnto vs this is the law and the prophets saith our sauiour christ now the square for all our actions must be the word of god and god word giues this directio do thou to thy neighbor as thou in thy reason amp coscience thinkest he should do to thee if thou wert in his case and he in thine the rule is that which paul teacheth vs saying giue vnto euery man that which is their duty tribute to whom tribute belongeth ampc that which god word amp our coscience amp the wholesome lawes of the realme binde vs vnto that wee must giue vnto euery man the rule is this euery man within the compasse of his calling must not onely intend and labour for his owne good but for the common good in that church and common wealth wherein he liueth the blinde would out of their carnall mindes haue learned this for a rule euery man for himselfe and god for vs all and this is many a mans practice hee will labour diligently in his calling but all is for himselfe but he that propoundeth onely this end in his calling to benefit himself alone dealeth vniustly both towards the church and common wealth in which he liueth who ought to haue a part of his care with himselfe the rule is taught vs also by s paul defraud or oppress no man in any matter this rule concerneth our manner of dealing in comon affairs in all our traffick amp bargains as we would benefit our selues so wee must seeke to benefit those with whom wee deale this rule is very necessary to be learned for this is y e comon practice of man in their traffic to vse all meanes whereby they may defraud others so that they get vnto themselues they care not how it come but in the feare of god let vs remember that the practice of iustice to which wee are all bound standeth in this that we defraud or oppresse no man in any thing and thus much of this second fruit of their faith the third fruit amp effect of these mens faith is this they obtained the promises by promises we must not vnderstand the maine promise cocerning the messias comming for that they obtained not as yet for as it appears v they receiued not that promise for christ was not incarnate in their time but by promises are here meant certaine speciall amp particular promises made vnto them alone and not common to all so that the meaning of these words is this they obtained the benefit and accomplishment of those particular promises that god made vnto them this effect is specially to be vnderstood of cale and dauid for cale entred into the land of canaan and there enioyed his possession according to god promise made vnto him ios so dauid had a particular promise made vnto him that he should be king ouer israel this he long waited for and resting herein he was not onely anointed king but in due time actually made king ouerall israell whereas these worthy man by faith obtained these promises hereby wee may bee directed to see the true cause why after so long preaching of the word and often receiuing of the sacraments man reape so little profit especialally considering that god hath made a promise of grace and saluation by meanes of his word and sacraments hence therefore wee must learne that the word of god preached and the sacraments receiued are vnprofitable not because god altereth his will having promised his blessing in these meanes for herein the will of god is vnchangeable but the cause is the great measure of vnbeleefe in those which heare and receiue they therefore profit not because they receiue them without faith for howsoeuer man say they haue faith yet the workes of their lyues and their estate in sinne after long hearing shew plainely they haue none at all take a vessell that is close stopped and cast it into a river or into the sea yet it receiues no water because it hath no place of entrance euen so bring a man that wants faith to the word and sacraments wherein god hath promised the fulnesse of his grace yet he receiues none because his heart is closed vp through vnbeleefe this is it which makes the heart like a stopped vessell which hath no entrance for god grace wee therfore in the feare of god must labour to haue our hearts purged from this vnbeleefe and lip faith and to be endued with true sauing faith whereby we may profitably heare the word and receiue the sacraments and so enioy god most excellent promises in christ man may lie and be deceiued but god is truth it selfe and cannot lie and therefore as he hath made his promise of life to beleeuers and to no other so will hee surely accomplish the same to them and to no other wherefore if we loue our soules and desire life let vs get into our hearts the grace of faith and thus much of the third effect of their faith the fourth and fift effects which i will handle together are these stopped the mouths of lions quenched the violence of the fire for the fourth whereas some of these persons are said to haue stopped the mouthes of lions it is to be vnderstood of daniel as appeareth in the chapter of that booke for daniel through the malice of others that incensed the kings wrath against him was cast into the denne of hunger bit lions but daniel euen then beleeued in the lord and put all his trust in god and for this cause the lord by his angel stopped the mouthes of the lions and as it were sealed vp their pawes that they could not hurt him the fift effect in quenching the violence of the fire must bee vnderstood of shadrach meshach and abednego the companions of daniel which three as we may read daniel refused to worship the golden image which nabuchadnezzar had set vp for which cause they were cast into an hot burning ouen but they put their trust in god and claue fast vnto him in obedience euen to the hazzard of their lyues whereupon the lord by his omnipotent power did most miraculously preserue them by staying the rage of the fire contrary to the nature thereof that it had no power ouer their body nay it did not burne the haire of their heads nor cause their garments to smell and therefore they are said to haue quenched the violence of it because it had no power ouer them thogh it burned most fiercely but was to them as though it had been quite put out and quenched now ioyn these two effects together amp they affoord vs good instructions first here wee learne how to behaue our selues in time of danger and at the point of death euen as these foure man did so must we from the bottome of our hearts forsake our selues and put all our trust in christ this did daniel when he was in the lions den and this did the children in the hot fiery furnace and this hath beene alwaies the auncient practice of god children in all ages at the very point of death and in the extremitie of all danger they rested themselues wholly vpon the mercifull promises of the true god the time wil come vpon vs all wherein wee shall be called to the practice of this duty for we must all passe the doore of death amp once lie in the pangs thereof now what shall we doe when we lie halfe dead gasping amp panting for breath able to speake to no man nor to heare any speaking to vs when all comfort of the world failes vs surely we must then at that very instant labour to leaue our selues and this world and yeeld vp our selues by faith into the hands of god and cleaue fast vnto christs passion from the bottome of our hearts and he will surely deliuer vs from the danger stopping the mouth of satan that roaring lion amp quenching the fire of hell that it shall not touch vs but some will say if this be all we must doe then all is well for this i can soone doe when time serues and therefore i will take no care till then answer beware of spirituall guile for it will be found a most hard matter for a man to rely and cast himselfe wholly vpon christ in the houre and pang of death for then aboue all times is the diuell busie against vs then will the conscience stir if euer and the body being tormented the soule must needes be wonderfull heauie this we may see by the state of our sauiour christ in his agony and passion and therefore wee must not reckon so lightly of this duty question but if it be so hard a thing how could daniell and the three children doe it answer they were prepared for it for they rested vpon god in the time of peace and so were enabled to rely vpon him in time of perill euen so if we would beleeue in god when wee die amp then shew forth our faith we must while we liue put our trust in him and shew it by obedience for rare it is to finde a man that liues in vnbeliefe to shew forth faith at his end and therefore while wee haue health strength and peace wee must labour to beleeue and then shall wee finde the comfort of it in time of perill and of death secondly from these two effects of faith wee obserue further that god diuine prouidence doth firmely rule and gouerne the whole world ordinarily god gouernes the world by secundarie causes setting one creature ouer another and ordaining one to doe this thing and another that and accordingly they worke but we must not thinke that god is bound to any of these meanes but is most free to vse them or not to vse them ordinarily he executeth this or that punishment by this or that creature and so by meanes conuayes his blessings but yet he can work without them as here we see for he preserues his creatures against the ordinary meanes as daniel from the lions whose nature is to deuoure and against the nature of fire he saued the three children in the fire so that god worketh by meanes but yet freely because he can work at his pleasure either without or against meanes and his powerfull hand sauing against meanes shewes his ruling and disposing prouidence ouer all things thirdly by these effects of their faith wee learne that god goodnesse and mercy towardes beleeuers is farre greater and more vnspeakeable than euer he promised or they could exspect this point is carefully to be considered of vs all for it is of singular amp extraordinary vse especially in time of perill and trouble and yet we see it is the plaine truth of god and therefore paul giues thanks and praise vnto god who is able to do for vs exceeding aboundantly aboue all that wee aske or thinke daniel put his trust in the lord when he was in the lions den and what doth he obtaine for his labour the lord neuer promised to stop the lions mouthes neither did daniell euer presume vpon that deliuerance and yet the lord saued him and so the three childre though they made no account of their liues because god had not promised to keep them fro burning yet they com out in safety for god in mercy so quenched the heat of y e fire vnto the that thogh it burnt to death those that cast them in yet did it not so much as burne their garments or the haire of their heads to cause the same to smel and the like is his goodnesse towards all his servant dauid saith the lord preuented him with liberall blessings that is when dauid neuer asked such blessings at god hand euen then did the lord bestowe his liberall blessings vpon him as namely this when dauid was following his fathers sheepe and walking in his calling he neuer dreamed of any kingdome yet thence the lord took him to be king ouer his people israell so the israelites hauing been yeares in captiuity neuer thought of returne and yet then were they deliuered and their deliuerance was so strange and miraculous that they were like them that dreame psalm when peter was cast into prison by herod and committed to foure quaternions of souldiers to be kept the angel of the lord came and awoke him as he slept and led him out of prison past the watches and through the iron gate and then left him now this deliuerance was so strange vnto him that he knew not whether it was true but thought he had seene a vision from hence it is that god hath made this gracious promise vnto his church to answer before they call and to heare while they speake isay so endlesse is his mercy and his goodnesse so vnspeakeable towards his servant that if they cleaue vnto him vnfainedly they shall finde his bounty farre surpassing all that they could aske or thinke the consideration hereof serues to stirre vp euery one of vs in our places to cleaue vnfainedly vnto the true god with all our hearts by faith in due reuerence and obedience if a servant were to choose his master and among an hundred should heare of one that besides his wages would giue vnto his servant gifts which they would not think of this servant would forsake all the rest to com vnto this one behold the lord our god is this bountifull master who doth not only keep couenant with his seruats in a full accomplishment of his promises but is exceeding gracious preuenting them with liberall blessings aboue all that they can wish for theselues wherfore let vs forsake all our bad masters the world the flesh and the diuell in the seruice of sinne and resigne our selues with full purpose of heart to serue this our good god to the end of our dayes there is no man liuing that can haue such cause of true ioy in heart as god servant haue for god shewes more kindenesse vnto them then they can aske or thinke of and take this for truth also there be none that thus giue themselues to serue god faithfully with all their harts but before they die they shal finde this to be true that god is a most mercifull god and his goodnesse endlesse towards them aboue their deserts secondly this endlesse mercy of god must mooue vs all to repent vs of our sinnes and to trust in him for the pardon of them be they neuer so many or haynous for they can neuer reach to the multitude of his mercies though they be in number like the sand of the sea they must not dismay vs from comming to him but considering that his goodnesse is endlesse and his mercy is ouer all his workes we must come vnto him for the pardon of our sinnes for god is mercifull to performe his promise yes and beyond his promise to doe for vs more than wee can thinke of many indeede abuse this mercie of god by presuming thereon to goe on in sinne but such deceiue themselues for god will not be mercifull vnto them deut it is the penitent person that shall finde mercy the sixt effect of their faith is in these words escaped the edge of the sword the words in the originall are thus escaped the mouth of the sword which is the hebrew phrase in the olde testament and heere followed by the pen man of this epistle and before where he calleth the word of god a two mouthed sword heb hereby meaning as it is translated a two edged sword this effect must be vnderstood of two worthy prophets elijah and elizeus for elijah wee may reade that when he had slaine baals priests kings iezabel the queene threatened to kill him which he hearing fled into the wildernesse and thence was led to mount horeb and there escaped by meanes of his faith and for elizeus wee may reade that when he disclosed the king of syriah his counsell to the king of israel kings hee was compassed about in dothan the city where he lay with a huge hoast of assyrians but praying to the lord the lord smote the hoast with blindnesse and so the prophet led them in safetie to samaria so then the meaning of this effect is that when these seruats of god were in distresse amp danger of death they denied themselues and their owne helpe amp by faith relied vpo god vnfainedly fro the bottom of their hearts amp so found deliuerance with god fro the perill of death first here wee learne that god prouides for the safetie and deliuerance of his servant in the extremitie of peril and danger when both might and multitude are against them this point we haue touched in diverse examples before and therefore doe here onely name it secondly in that these man in the extremity of danger beleeued and so escaped the edge of the sword we learne that when we are in greatest danger so as we see no way to escape euen then wee must put our trust in the true god and he will saue vs this wee must doe not onely for the safety of our body but more especially for the saluation of our soule put the case a man were in despaire of his saluation and that hee sees legions of diuels compassing him about to take him away what must this man doe in this case answer looke what elijah and elizeus did the same thing must hee doe hee must not lie dead in desperation yielding thereto but at the very same time when such terror oppresse him hee must by faith lift vp his heart to god and put all his trust and confidence in him thorough christ and if hee can this doe hee may assure himselfe that hee shall as certainly escape these fearefull terror of conscience and the torments of hell as elijah amp elizeus did the edge of the sword for let a man put his whole trust in god and whatsoeuer his troubles bee god will deliuer him great are the troubles of the righteous but the lord deliuers him out of them all psalm indeed wee must not limit god for time or manner of deliuerance but waite on god by faith accounting his grace sufficient till deliuerance come and thus much of the sixt effect the seauenth effect of their faith is this of weake were made strong or thus of weake were restored to health this must bee vnderstood of hezekias a worthy king of iuda who as we may read kings beeing sore sicke euen vnto death was restored to health and obtained of god the lengthening of his daies for the space of fifteene yeares which wonderfull recouery hee obtained by meanes of his faith which hee shewed in time of his sicknesse by a prayer he made vnto god the substance wherof stood in these two things first beeing very sicke hee praied for the pardon of his sinnes this appeareth by his thanksgiuing vpon his recouery isay where hee confesseth that god had cast all his sinnes behinde his backe now looke for what hee gaue thanks that no doubt hee had before begged of god in praier secondly hee made request vnto god for prolonging of his daies for some reasons which did concerne himselfe and this hee also prayed for in faith now the reasons moouing him to pray for longer life were these first hee had then no issue to succeed him in his kingdome and therefore hee praied for life to beget a childe which might sit vpon his throne after him and the ground of this praier was this god had made a particular promise vnto dauid and salomon kings that they should not want issue after them to sit vpon the throne of israel so that their children tooke heede to their way to walke before the lord as dauid did now king hezekiah knowing this promise had regard hereunto and building himself hereon his conscience bearing him witnesse that hee had walked before the lord vprightly hee praies for issue to succeed him and for that cause he desires strength of body and length of daies this appeareth notably by his praier king lord saith he i beg thee now remember how i haue walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart the summe of his praier is this all the kings succeeding dauid and salomon which walke in god commandements shall haue issue to sit on their thrones after them now from hence he praies thus oh lord i haue walked before thee in truth and sincerity of heart and hereupon the conclusion followes grant me issue to sit vpon my throne after me and therefore life and health to accomplish the same secondly he praied that he might liue to glorifie god in that weighty calling wherein god had placed him ouer his people this appeareth likewise by his thanksgiuing vnto the lord vpon his recouery where hee saith isay he lord was ready to saue me therefore wee will sing my song all the daies of our life in the house of the lord thus by his worthy praier hee shewed forth his faith notably by vertue whereof beeing sicke vnto death hee obtained of the lord the prolonging of his daies for the space of fifteene yeares and so we see to whom this seauenth effect of faith is to be referred here we are taught a speciall duty for the recouery of our health in the time of sickenesse to wit before wee vse the ordinary meanes of physicke wee must according to this example first put our faith in practice by humbling our selues for our sinnes past confessing them truely vnto god and praying for pardon from a resolute purpose of heart to lead a newe life and also by intreating health of god and his good blessing vpon the meanes which we shall vse for our recouery thus haue other of god servant done beside hezekias when dauid was grieuously sicke the principal thing he did was this practice of faith in humbling his soule before god for his sinnes and intreating earnestly the pardon of them as we may see psalm amp this is the principal thing which in those psalms is propounded of dauid and so the apostle counsels iam is any man sicke among you let him call for the elders of the church and what must they doe surely first pray for him and then as the custome was in those daies anoint him with oyle in the name of the lord and the praier of faith shall saue the sicke and the lord shall raise him vp againe and if hee haue committed any sinne it shall be forgiuen him and here we must be admonished to beware of the bad practices of the world in this case the most man in their sickenesse first seeke to the physicians and if that faile them they send for the minister this was king asa his practice for which hee is branded to all posteritie that beeing diseased in his feete hee sought vnto physicians and not vnto the lord chronicle though otherwise hee had good things in him as king and many do farre worse who seeke to witches and inchanters when they or theirs are in such distresse but this is to forsake god and to seeke help of the diuel like to ahaziah who sent to baalzebub the god of ekron to know of his recouery when he was sicke vpon a fall kings this should be far from all god children for as ahaziahs sickenesse became deadly through his sending to baalzebub so vndoubtedly many diseases become incurable by the bad and preposterous dealing of the patient who either vseth unlawful meanes or lawful meanes disorderedly or trusting therein wee therefore in this case must remember our duty in the practice of faith as hezekiah did the eight fruit of faith is this waxed valiant in battell this effect may well bee vnderstood of all the iudges before named and of all the good kings in iuda and israel but yet there be two especially to whom wee may more peculiarly referre it to wit samson and dauid for samson he by meanes of faith came to be so mighty iudg that with the iawe bone of an asse he slew a thousand philistims and for dauid he likewise was so incouraged by faith that with the same sling wherewith he kept his fathers sheepe which was but a slender weapon for war hee encountred with goliah that huge philistim and hit him with a stone in the forehead and slew him both these facts were the fruits of their faith which made them bolde to encounter with these mighty enemy in this effect of their faith first wee may obserue that true fortitude and manhood right valour and courage comes from true faith it must bee graunted that many heathen man had great strength and courage but indeed it was but a shadow of true valour for right valour coms from a beleeuing heart and therefore it is said that these iudges and princes of israel waxed strong in battell by faith secondly doth true faith make man valiant in battell then should the preaching of the word bee set vp and maintained as well in the campe and guarison and among souldiers on the seas as in cities and townes of peace for the preaching of the word is the meanes of this faith which giues valour in battell to them that fight in a good cause hence it was that the lord inioyned by moses that when the people of israel went out to battell the priests should come forth and incourage the people that their hearts might not faint nor feare nor dread their enemy because of the powerfull presence of god fighting for them the papists obiect this by way of reproach against zwinglius who was one of the restorers of the gospel that hee died in the fielde among souldiers but this indeed is no reproach but rather a matter of great commendation vnto him in that for the increase of faith and knowledge in them that were weake christians about him hee was content to hazard his owne life and thus much of the eight effect the ninth effect of faith for which these worthy man are commended is this they turned to flight the armies of the alients this may be vnderstoode of the most of the iudges and of the good kings of iuda and israell but i will make choyse especially of two gedion and iehosaphat for gedion one of the iudges with three hundred souldiers iudges and altogether vnweaponed onely with light pitchers in their hands put to flight a mighty huge armie of the midianites and iehosaphat a godly king being assaulted with a mighty and great armie of moabites ammonites and man of mount seir knew that by force of armes hee could not withstand them and therefore by faith makes a worthy prayer vnto the lord and the lord heard him and set his enemy one against another and so did he put them to flight which hee could neuer haue done by any strength of his owne heere wee may learne how kingdomes and people may become able to put to flight their enemy the best way is to put in practice their faith in god by humbling themselues truly for their sinnes past with vnfained confession of them vnto god praying withall earnestly for the pardon of them and for god aide assistance amp protection against their enemy the power of this meanes is euident in scripture and therefore when eliah was taken vp elisha cried my father my father the chariot of israell and the horse man thereof kings giuing him this notable commendations that he was as good to israell by meanes of his faith as all their chariots and horse man question how could that possibly be true answer if we reade the story wee shall finde it to be most true that by his prayers which he made in faith he did as much or more then al the strength of the land could doe and so it shall be with all christian kings and people if they can shew forth their faith by prayer vnto god they shall doe wonderfull much hereby in subduing of their enemy to apply this to our selues wee haue had many and dangerous assaults from popish enemy both domestical and foreign who haue of long time and no doubt stil doe purpose our ouerthrowe now how shall wee be able to withstand their might and to escape their malice true it is christian policy and warlike prouision must be vsed yet our stay and rest must not be thereon but wee must stirre vp our faith both magistrates and subiects prince and people and first of all humble our selues for our sins and shew forth our repentance by new obedience in time to come and then pray for a blessing vpon the outward meanes which shall be vsed this is the right practice of faith in the case of danger by our enemy which we shal finde if we exercise it vnfainedly to be a surer meanes of safety and victory against our enemy then all worldly munition and policie for hereby we shall haue the lord for our protection and his blessing vpon the outward meanes giuing strength and good successe thereunto when as omitting this duty the lord will not be with vs and then we shall finde that vaine is the strength or wit of man let vs not therefore betray our selues wilfully into our enemy hand but by this practice of faith enable our selues against all our enemy whatsoeuer otherwise wee may iustly feare to be deliuered into their hands for a prey vnto their teeth and therefore if we loue our owne safetie and the wel fare of our land let vs practice this duty for the prayer of faith auaileth much with god if it be feruent and therefore the lord saith to moses when he fell down before him to turne backe the wrath that was broken in vpon the people let me alone as though moses had held or bound the lord hand by his prayer that hee could not smite his people and thus much for the ninth fruite of faith the woman receiued their dead raised vp to life this is the tenth and last fruit of their faith which must be vnderstood of these two woman especially the widow of zarephath and the shunamite the widow of zarephath giuing entertainment o eliiah in the great famine had this blessing vouchsafed vnto her for her faith that her dead son was restored to life by the prophet and the shunamite that prouided lodging for the prophet elisha had her onely son restored to life from death by the prophet through faith now heere we must obserue that these two woman did not only beleeue in the true god but more particularly that god would vse these his servant as meanes to restore to life their two children that were dead as appeares by this that both of them made means to the prophet for the reuiuing of their children which they did by faith but some wil say this last effect of faith may seeme to crosse the scripture else where which saith that christ is the first fruites of them that sleepe how then could these that were before christs incarnation be restored from death to life answer saint pauls meaning is this that christ is the first of all those that rose from death to life to die no more but to liue for euer so indeede christ is the first fruites of them that sleepe for he rose to liue for euer as for these two and some other mentioned both in the olde testament and the new that were raised from death to life they rose not from the sleepe of death to liue for euer but to die againe in this tenth fruite of faith all parents may learne their duty towards their children in the case of sicknesse or such like they must follow the example of these two godly woman and labour especially to shew forth their faith in such duties as god requireth in such a case to wit they must humble themselues for their owne sinnes and for the sinnes of their children and family praying earnestly to god for the pardon of them for god may visite the iniquity of the parents vpon the children in bodily iudgements and entreating the lord to restore them to health and liberty and withall they must vse the ordinarie lawful meanes of recouerie in physicke and such like praying to god for a blessing thereupon this is their dutie but alas the manner and practice of many parents is farre otherwise for whereas they should first seeke vnto the lord and come to his prophet they either runne first to the ordinary meanes of physicke or being worse disposed seeke help of wizards amp blessers by their charmes and sorceries forsaking god and running to the diuell indeede the vse of lawful meanes is not to be discommended simply but this preposterous course is blame worthy and depriues many of god blessing in the meanes that they seeke helpe of physick before they haue sought to the lord in this holy practice of faith quest but how can the parents faith benefit the childe answer it cannot procure vnto it eternall life for euery one must bee saued by his owne faith in christ and yet the childe receiues many a good blessing at god hand by meanes of the parents faith as namely the benefit of the couenant of grace in the seales thereof besides the fruition of many temporall blessings as life it selfe in this place the consideration hereof must mooue all parents aboue all things to labour for true faith for by the practice hereof they shall be able to bring the greatest blessing vpon themselues and their children and vpon the lawful meanes which they shall vse for their good say the lord shall lay his hand vpon children and servant in a family what must parents and masters doe surely the best way for helpe is the practice of faith in true humiliation for sinne and prayer to god for mercy and for a blessing vpon the meanes which they shall vse in all societies this is true that by the faith of the gouernors many curses are remooued and many blessings procured god sends his iudgements among vs daily and we knowe not when other moe shall befall vs but for the remoueall and preueting of them we must giue our selues to true humiliation and praier and so shal we finde the lord mercy towards vs as these two woman did and thus much of this tenth fruit of faith and of them all seuerally now from them all ioyntly together obserue this speciall point that faith is such a grace of god as doth bring downe from heauen vpon euery beleeuer all god blessings that are needfull for him who is hee that desires not to bee made partaker of god blessing needfull for him both in soule and body well the onely way and meanes hereto is to get a true and liuely faith and to put the same in practice in all such duties as god shall require at our hands the worthy man before named obtained al the former most wonderfull blessings by meanes of their faith by it they scaped the edge of the sword they quenched the violence of the fire waxed mighty in battel ampc as wee haue heard now if faith be such a notable grace of god then aboue all things in this world let vs labour for it we must not content our selues with lip faith and so presume vpon god mercies but wee must labour for a true and liuely faith in christ which may purifie our hearts and bring forth fruit in our lyues here are strong motiues to perswade vs hereunto for what doe wee desire riches honour or fauour and grace in the world would wee haue health and strength nay the fauour of god which is all in all then looke to get true faith for in the practice thereof thou shalt obtaine of god all needfull blessings both temporall and spirituall many toyle themselues exceedingly by worldly meanes to get temporall blessings as health wealth honour ampc and yet neuer attaine thereto because they seeke them not by faith i confesse naturall man get many good things but to them they are no blessings because they want faith both in getting and keeping of them for they lay all religion aside and toyle themselues wholly in worldly meanes this course the childe of god must beware of say that a prince bids one of his servant goe to his treasurie and there inrich himselfe with iewels with gold and siluer and with whatsoeuer he lacketh what will this man doe surely first hee will call for the keyes wherby he may vnlocke the doors and chests for else he can get nothing behold in the ministerie of his word god shewes vs his full treasury wherin wee may inrich our selues with all his blessings now wee must not with the foole runne without the key but labour first for true faith which is that key whereby god heauenly treasures are opened vnto vs and we must be sure that we haue a sound key that is a true and sound faith which may strongly turn about the lockes of god treasury for this is most certaine he that doth vnfainedly beleeue shall neuer want any thing either in body or soule that is good for him to haue euery one will say hee beleeues but the truth is that true faith is rare for mens hearts are not purified nor their lyues changed but they remaine as sinnefull as ever they were which causeth god iudgements to be rife among vs wherefore as we desire our owne good both in soule and body so let vs labour for true faith and shewe forth the power of it in our lyues and thus much of these iudges and prophets and of the fruits of their faith others also were racked and would not bee deliuered that they might receiue a better resurrection in these words the author of this epistle proceedes to the fourth order of examples of faith contained in this chapter wherein as in the former lastly handled hee proceedes briefly heaping vp in fewe words many worthy exaples of faith cocealing the names of the parties amp onely setting downe those things for which their faith is commended vnto vs and this fourth and last order of examples comprehendeth such beleeuers as liued vnder the regiment of the maccabees and afterward to the comming of christ for of beleeuers in former times it cannot be vnderstoode because there is a manifest distinction put betweene these beleeuers and the former iudges kings and prophets in these words others also whereby it is plaine that heere he propounds examples of beleeuers different from those which hee mentioned before and it is also plaine that these beleeuers liued before the comming of christ for howsoeuer the christians in the primitiue church were racked scourged and tormented after this sort yet of them this place cannot be vnderstoode because they enioyed the promise of the messias but these heere mentioned enioyed not that promise in their dayes but wayted for it by faith and therein died verse and indeede in the time of the maccabees the church of the iewes was wonderfully persecuted by antioch about two hundred yeares before christ as we may see maccabees and chapters question where had the author of this epistle this large narration of these strange persecutions seeing they are not registred in the bookes of the olde testament answere wee may iudge that hee gathered it out of the stories and records of man which howsoeuer they bee not now extant yet in his dayes in the primitiue church were extant knowen and approoued neither must this seeme strange vnto vs for the spirit of god in the olde testament speaking of man hath oftentimes reference and relation therein to humane writings as this phrase the rest of the actes of such and such are they not written in the bookes of the chronicles of the kings of iuda and israell so often vsed in the bookes of kings and chronicles doth euidently declare nowe those bookes of chronicles were not parcelles of holy scripture but ciuill or ecclesiasticall stories like to our bookes of martyrs and chronicles timothie chapter verse saint paul saith iannes and iambres resisted moses nowe in the booke of exodus wee shall not finde the sorcerers that withstoode moses once named and saint iude maketh mention of a prophecie of enoch iude verse which in all the olde testament is not recorded and it is like that moses was the first penne manne of holie scripture whence then had these apostles these things answere no doubt the holy ghost might reueale such things vnto them though they had beene vnknowen in those times but it is more probable that the apostles had them out of some iewish writers or records then extant and approued among the iewes so paul preaching to the athenians alledgeth the saying of aratus an athenian poet for wee are his generation and to the corinthians he propoundeth a sentence of menander euill words corrupt good manners corinthian and to titus hee alledgeth epimenides a cretian poet the cretians are alwaies liers euill beast slowe bellies titus now whereas the spirit of god taketh these sentences out of the writings of man we may learne that to read the writings of man is not unlawful but a thing of good vse to the seruats of god but wheras som would hence proue that their authority may be alledged ordinarily at euery mans pleasure in the publique ministerie it hath no ground in these places for first the apostles were so guided by the holy ghost in their publique ministerie that they could not erre but no ministers at this day haue such a priuiledge secondly the apostles alledging or recording the sayings of man in their sermons or writings did thereby sanctifie them and make them to become a part of holy scripture this no ordinarie minister can doe but let him alledge a humane testimonie tenne thousand times yet still it remaines humane and is not god word thirdly they that would warrant their practice in alledging humane testimonies in their sermons by the apostles ought to follow the apostles in their manner of allegations now the apostles were so sparing heerein that in many bookes wee shall not finde one for there are onely three in all the new testament againe the apostles did it without ostentation for the names of the authors are concealed whence they tooke their testimonies and lastly the apostles did it vpon weighty cause and iust occasion to wit when they were perswaded in conscience that those testimonies would conuince the consciences of their hearer in those things for which they alledged them now how farre many differ from the apostles in their allegations let the world iudge yet before wee come to speake of these examples of faith in particular there are sundry generall points to be handled in the three former verses the spirit of god hath sette downe the prosperous successe of beleeuers through faith but heere hee comes to acquaint vs with a different estate of other beleeuers vnder greeuous persecutions and torments euen vnto most cruell and bitter kindes of death from this which the apostle heere obserueth wee may take a view of the state of god church and people heere in this world for god vouchsafeth peace and prosperous successe to some as a iust reward of faith and obedience but others must want the comfort of outward peace and welfare and vndergoe most greeuous trials and persecutions looke as there is a continuall interchange betweene day and night and the one doth constantly follow the other so as it is one while day and an other while night so is it with the church of god and with true beleeuers in this world somtime they haue peace and prosperity and this continueth not alway but another while they are in trouble miserie and persecution to make this point more plaine because it is of some importance wee may beholde the truth of it in the church of god from the beginning adams familie was god church and therein was first notable peace but when god accepted abels sacrifice and refused cains then persecution began and cain slew his brother abell abraham is called the father of the faithfull and his family in those daies was the true church of god wherin we may notably see this changeable estate for god calls him out of charran to dwell in the land of canaan exod but within a while the family was so great in the land that hee was faine to goe downe into egypt to soiourne there and there the lord blessed him exceedingly and inriched him so greatly that he became a mighty prince able to encounter with the kings of those nation in battell after his returne to canaan exod the israelites god chosen people were yeare in bondage in egypt but at the appointed time god gaue them a glorious deliuerance and yet they were tried in the wildernes yeares after which time they were plated safely in the fruitfull land of canaan a land that flowed with milke and hony and there also the church of god was in this case sometime in prosperitie and otherwhiles in aduersity for when it was ruled by iudges as in that booke appeares for ten twenty thirty or fourty yeares together the israelites for their sinnes were in subiection amp bondage to the nation about them as the moabites the philistims the ammonites ampc yet then when they cried to god he sent them some mighty iudge to deliuer them for so long time againe this was the interchangeable estate of the church all the time of the iudges and afterward when it was gouerned by kings it was in the same case for one while god gaue them good kings who would aduance religion and maintaine and cherish the priests and prophets of god and for their time the church prospered but otherwhiles for their sinnes god would send them wicked princes which persecuted the prophets and the godly in the land this is plaine in the bookes of the kings and chronicles after the raign of good king iosias cam the captiuity into babylo amp years expired the lord by k cyrus returned the againe after their returne they were one while in peace and another while in distresse as we may see in the bookes of ezra and nehemias but aboue all other that persecution of antioch epiphanes was most notorious which was foretold by daniel in his prophecy daniel and is recorded in the books of the maccabees to come to the times of the gospel the primitiue church after the ascension of christ in the first yeares suffered ten most bloody amp grieuous persecutios between each of which shee yet had some times of peace and as it were respite to breath in and after the tenth persecutio ended the lord raised vp the good emperour constatine who broght peace amp welfare vnto the church but soone after him the heresie of arrius raised vp by the diuell brought as grieuous persecutions vpon the church as euer the pagan did beeing a most blasphemous heresie denying the eternall deity of christ and of the holy ghost and it preuailed in the church for yeares not long after the suppression of that heresie began the idolatry and tyrannie of antichrist to preuaile in the church for many hundred yeares and now about some fourescore yeares agone the lord in mercy raised vp worthy instruments by whose meanes hee deliuered his church from that idolatry and blindnesse yet so as still the church hath felt the bloody hand of antichrist in grieuous persecutions all which shewes this to be most true that the outward state of god church is interchangeable hauing one while peace and another while grieuous persecution to apply this to our selues god hath planted his church among vs in this land and for many yeares together hath blessed vs with prosperity and peace which in great mercy hee hath giuen vs as a reward of the faith of his servant which are among vs and during this time wee haue had great freedome and liberty in god holy ministery for the word praier amp sacraments but we must knowe that the state of god church for peace and trouble is interchangeable as day and night for light and darkenesse wherefore we must be aduertised to look vnto our selues for our estate in peace must not last alwaies these golden daies will haue an ende and troubles and afflictions will vndoubtedly come indeede god onely knoweth what kinde of afflictions shall befall and the particular time thereof but that they shall come in the time appointed of god we may resolue our selues by the reasons following first the tenour of the law is this that the curse doth follow the transgression so that when any man family or people liue in the breach of god commandements they must looke for god iudgements to bee powred vpon them now we may too truely assume that this our nation and people abound with grieuous sinne in all estates for in the ciuill estate to omit manifold practices of oppression where is iustice without bribery or bargaining without fraud and deceit and in the ministery beside many abuses where is that care which ought to be for the building of god church and for the body of our people beside grosse ignorance and superstition what fearfull blasphemy whoredome swearing and sabbaoth breaking doth every where abound beside fearefull atheisme which is a mother of abhominations whether we respect naturall atheisme whereby many deny god by their workes or learned atheisme in some who dispute against the truth of god reuealed in his word all these and many other sinnes among vs crie lowd for god iudgements vpon vs euen for that fearefull iudgement the remooueall of god kingdome in the gospel of peace secondly consider what manner of persons of place and note both in church and common wealth god takes from vs by death even in their best time are they not such as excelled among vs for great wisdom and learning and for true piety and good conscience now howsoeuer this may seeme but a small thing in the eyes of many yet vndoubtedly it is a forerunner of god iudgements for the righteous perish and no man considereth it in heart and mercifull man are taken away and no man vnderstandeth that the righteous is taken away from the euill to come isa thirdly god hath set his fearefull iudgements among vs and about vs war and sword in our neighbour nation which also hath beene oft shaken at vs also famine and pestilence throughout our owne land by intercourse and long continuance leuit now this is the truth of god that when god sendes his iudgements vpon a people if they doe not repent one iudgement is but the forerunner of another more grieuous and terrible than the former but little or no repentance appeares among vs nay rather we fall away more and more and so stand still in daunger of more fearefull iudgements lastly it is vsuall with god thus to deale with his own servant as he doth sometime reward their faith and obedience with peace so otherwhiles he wil trie their faith by affliction thus he dealt with his servant iob though there were none for piety like him in his time through all the world now god hath his servant among vs for the triall of whose faith we may perswade our selues some tribulation shall come vppon vs for all that will liue godly in christ iesus shall suffer tribulation tim this being so that our peace shall be turned into trouble as by the former reasons which directly fasten themselues vpon our church and state may euidently appear let vs then here learne our dutie first wee must cast with our selues what may bee the worst that can befall vs when triall and persecution shall come this is the counsell of our sauiour christ to those that would follow him constantly as good disciples they must as good builders consider of the cost before they laie the foundation and like good warriers consider of their strength before they goe out into the field lest they leaue off amp turn back like fooles and cowards luke ampc we by god mercy doe now professe the true religion of christ with hope to be saued thereby therefore wee must cast with our selues what our religion may cost vs and see before hand what is the worst thing that may befall vs for our profession of christ and his gospel if wee haue not done this at the beginning of our profession we must now doe it for better late than neuer lest going on securely without this account making we shamefully forsake christ when triall comes in former times the constant profession of christ hath cost man losse of friends losse of goods and liberty yes the losse of their hearts blood and the same case may befall vs wherefore wee must cast with our selues and see whether wee bee willing to suffer the losse of goods and frieds yes the losse of our liues for the defence of christs true religion againe as this estate of the church must mooue vs to make this account for resolution in suffering so it must teach vs to labour for those sauing graces of god spirit which may inable vs to stand fast in all temptations troubles amp persecutions we must not content our selues with blazing lamps as the fiue foolish virgin did but get the oyle of grace into the vessels of our hearts knowledge in the word is a comendable thing but not sufficiet to make vs stand in the day of triall we therfore must labour for true sauing graces especially for this to haue our hearts rooted and grounded in the loue of god through faith whereby we are assured that god is our father in christ and iesus christ our redeemer and the holy ghost our comforter and sanctifier this assurance of faith will stablish our hearts in all estates come life come death wee neede not feare for nothing shall be able to separate vs from this loue of god in christ iesus and thus much of the coherence of this verse with the former now to the words others also were racked ampc heere the holy ghost begins to propound the fruites of faith for which this last ranke of beleeuers are commended vnto vs and they are not such famous exploites as the former but nine seuerall kindes of sufferings vnto all which wee must remember to apply this clause by faith from the verse as thus through faith they endured racking mocking and so for all the rest out of these effects in generall wee may learne two things first a singular fruite of faith for which it is heere so highly commended in this last ranke of examples to wit that by it the childe of god is enabled to beare whatsoeuer the lord shall lay vpon him the torments wherewith mans body may be afflicted are manie and terrible and yet be they neuer so many nor so terrible true sauing faith will make the childe of god to beare them all for the honour of christ the effects of faith before set downe were many and singular but vndoubtedly this strength of patience which it giueth vnder the greatest torments for christes sake is one of the principall this paul doth notably testifie in this profession romanes chapter verses i am perswaded that neither death nor life nor angelles nor principality nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor height nor depth nor any other creature shall bee able to separate vs from the loue of god which is in christ iesus our lord oh singular power of faith which so firmely vnites the beleeuer vnto christ that no torments in the world no not all the power of satan and his angels can separate them asunder question how doth faith worke this indissoluble power in cleauing vnto christ answere after this manner it is the property of faith to perswade the conscience of god loue and fauour in christ and vpon this perswasion the heart begins to loue god againe now by this loue doth faith worke and make a man able to beare all torments that can be inflicted for religions sake for loue suffereth all things corinthian euen that loue wherewith one man loueth another how much more then shall this loue wherewith we loue god in christ make vs to suffer any thing for his names sake hence it is that loue is said to be strong as death and the coales therof are fierie coales and a vehement flame yes much water cannot quench loue neither can the flouds drowne it that is grieuous persecutions and torments cannot extinguish the same nay such is the power of loue to god when it is feruent that it makes a man so zealous of god glory that if there were no other way to glorifie god than by sufferings the childe of god would rather yeeld himselfe to endure the torments of the damned than suffer god to lose his glory this wee may see in paul rom i would wish my selfe saith he to be separate from christ for my brother that are my kinsmen according to the flesh that is the israelites meaning for the advancement of god glory in their calling and saluation such zeale likewise we may see in moses for thinking that god should lose his glory if the israelites were destroyed he prayes the lord to pardon their sinne but if thou wilt not then saith hee raze me out of the booke which thou hast written this being the fruite of faith to make a man able and willing to suffer any thing for christs sake we must heereby be moued to labour for true faith for tribulation may come nay some affliction will come on euery childe of god more or lesse now without faith wee shall neuer be able to glorifie god vnder the crosse the iust must liue by faith in this estate heb as here they endure racking burning hewing asunder ampc and all by faith secondly out of all these sufferings heere endured by faith note the minde and disposition of vngodly man towards god church and people they are most bitterly amp bloudily bent against them for here they put in execution vpon god children whatsoeuer cruelty the diuell could suggest into their hearts and this hath beene their disposition and behauiour not onely before christes incarnation but also euer since as may appeare by the manifolde strange tortures deuised against christians in the primitiue church and both then and since inflicted vpon them beholde it in the church of rome especially in their late inquisition whereby beside the cruell racking of the conscience by vniust inquiries they put the protestant to most cruell torments the consideration of this cruell disposition in the wicked against the godly is of speciall vse first it proues vnto vs that the religion which by god mercy we professe contained in the bookes of the olde and new testament is no politic deuice of man but the sacred ordinance of the euerliuing god for if it were the inuention of man it would so fit their humour and accord with their nature that generally it would be loued and embraced and not one of an hundred would mislike it but we see it is generally detested this sect is euery where spoken against acts naturall man reiect it and persecute it and the professours of t vnto the death this they doe because true religion is contrary to their nature as light is to darknesse and condemnes those wayes and courses which they best like of this reason shall iustifie true religion to be god owne ordinance euen to the conscience of the worldly atheist his diuellish malice against it proues god diuine truth to be in it secondly doe the wicked hate the godly because of their religion and profession then on the contrary wee must learne to loue religion because it is religion and the professours of it for their professions sake this is christs instruction to loue a disciple because he is a disciple mat indeede wee must loue all man but especially those that embrace the gospell of christ and be of the housholde of faith for all such are brother hauing one father which is god and brother ought to loue one another but alas this lesson is not learned for the world generally is giuen to mocking and scoffing amp the matter of their mocking is religion and the professers thereof this ought not to be so for howsoeuer man may faile both in knowledge amp practice yet the professers of religion should not be so despised this abuse is growen to such a height that many refraine the diligent hearing of the word preached least they should be mocked but let these mockers know that heerein they shake hands with the diuell and with the persecuters of god church for mocking is a kinde of persecution young christians should not be so dealt with but rather encouraged for the advancement of the kingdome of christ thus dealt our sauiour christ with those that gaue any testimonie of the sparkes of grace when the young man said he had from his youth kept god commaundements the text saith iesus beheld him and loued him marke and hearing a scribe answer discreetly he said vnto him thou article not farre from the kingdome of god marke chapter ver now we must be followers of christ and walke in loue iudging and speaking the best of all professours accounting none for hypocrites till god make their hypocrisie knowen it is a note of a christian to loue a man because hee loues religion on the contrarie to hate a man because hee is a christian is a note of a persecuter and an enemie to christ and thus much in generall now wee come in particular to the seuerall kindes of sufferings which these beleeuers endured by faith the first whereof is racking in these words others also were racked or as some translate it and others were beaten with clubbes for the words in the originall will beare either translation and both of them fitly agree to this kinde of suffering for in these times the enemy of god church vsed to set the body of them that were to be tormented vpon rackes and engines whereon they stretched out euery ioynt and then did beat the whole body thus racked with clubs till the party were starke dead an example of this kind of suffering we haue in eleazer a iewe mac who vnder antioch was first racked and then beaten on euery part of his body vnto the death because he refused to eat swines flesh but some will say this cannot be any commendation of faith to be racked and beaten to death for malefactors and traytors are so vsed ans to preuent this obiectio the holy ghost addeth these words and would not be deliuered or would not accept deliuerance to shewe that this suffering was a notable commendation of true faith the meaning of the words is this that whereas some iewes in the olde testament were condemned to death for their religion by persecutors and yet had life and libertie offered vnto the if they would recant and forsake their religion this proffer of life they refused and would not be deliuered vpon such a condition in this example of faith we are taught to hold fast true religion and to preferre the enioying of it before all the pleasures and commodity in the world yes before life it self this point paul vrgeth in sundry exhortations saying let him that thinketh he standeth take heede lest hee fall co forbidding vs to preserue our outward peace by communicating with idolaters and againe stand fast in the faith corinthian yes this is one maine point that paul vrgeth to timothy in both his epistles to keepe faith and a good conscience and our sauiour christ in one of his parables math compares the kingdom of heauen to a treasure hid in the field which when a man findeth hee hideth it amp goes home amp sels al he hath to buy the field wherby he would teach vs that euery ones duty who would enioy the kingdom of heauen is this in regard of it to forgoe and forsake all things else esteeming them to bee drosse and dongue as paul did philip what though a man had all the riches and pleasures of the world amp al things else for this life that his heart could wish yet if he want religion and a good conscience all he hath is nothing for so he wants the loue and fauour of god amp shall lose his soule for the ransome whereof all the world can doe nothing wherefore we must hereby be admonished to haue more care to get and maintaine true religion and a good conscience than any thing in the world besides now because nature will iudge it a part of rashnesse to refuse life when it is offered therfore to preuent this conceit against these beleeuers the holy ghost sets downe a notable reason of this their fact to wit they refused deliuerance that they might receiue a better resurrection many interpreters vnderstand these words of the resurrection at the day of iudgement simply as though the holy ghost had said these martyrs therefore refused to be deliuered from death because they looked to receiue at the day of iudgement a greater measure of glory euen for this that in obedience to god for the maintenance of true religion they were content to lay downe their liues this no doubt is the truth of god that the more wee humble our selues in suffering for the name of christ in this life the greater shall our glory bee at the generall resurrection for our light affliction which is but for a moment causeth vnto vs a farre more excellent and eternall waight of glory corinthian and yet as i take it that is not the meaning of these words but their resurrection at the last day is here tearmed better than the temporall deliuerance offered vnto them for beeing in torments on the racke they were but dead man and when life was offered vnto them it was as it were a kinde of resurrection and in regard of the enemy of the church a good resurrection but for that they would not lose the comfort of resurrection to life at the last day here then are two resurrections compared together the first is a deliuerance from temporall death the second is a rising to life euerlasting at the last day of iudgement now of these two the later is the better and that in the iudgement of god servant and martyrs so then the true meaning of these wordes is this these servant of god refused deliuerance from temporall tortures and punishments because their care and desire was that their body might rise againe to life euerlasting at the day of iudgement which rising againe to life at that day they iudged farre better than to rise to a temporall life for a while in this world this reason wel obserued may teach vs these two speciall duties first to be carefull aboue all things for assurance in our consciences as these servant of god had that our body shall rise againe to life euerlasting at the last day true it is wee make this confession with our mouthes among the articles of our faith but we must labour to bee setled and resolued effectually in our hearts that these our body be they neuer so miserably tormented here shall one day rise to life and glory by iesus christ all the true martyrs of christ knewe and were resolued of this and this it was that made them so confident in their sufferings and if wee can attaine vnto it we shall finde great vse hereof both in life and death for our lyues this will moue vs to embrace true religion from our hearts and in all things to indeauour to keep a good conscience this paul testifieth act for hauing made profession of his hope in the resurrection both of iust and vniust he saith and herein i endeauour my selfe to haue alwaies a cleere conscience both towards god and towards man and for death this perswasion also is of great vse for it will notably stay the heart against the naturall feare of death it is a wonder to see how terrible the thoughts of death are to many a one now this feare ariseth hence that they are not in heart resolued of their resurrection to life and glory at the last day for if they were they would endeuour themselues with patience and with comfort to vndergoe the pangs thereof though neuer so terrible secondly hence we must learne so to leade this temporall life that when we are dead our body may rise againe to life eternall these martyrs are a notable precedent herein vnto vs for they are so resolute to holde that course of life which hath the hope of glory that they will rather lose temporall life then leaue that course and indeede this duty is so necessary that vnlesse we order wel this temporall life we can neuer haue hope to rise to glory quest how should we leade this temporall life that we may rise to glory after death answer this s john teacheth vs revelation blessed and holy is he that hath his part in the first resurrection for on such the second death hath no power wee must therefore labour earnestly to haue our part heerein this first resurrection is spirituall wrought in the soule by the holy ghost causing him that is by nature dead in sinne to rise to newnesse of life whereof whosoeuer is truly partaker shall vndoubtedly rise to glory for they that are quickned in christ fro the death of sin are made to sit together in heauenly places in christ iesus ephesians naturall death may seuer soule amp body for a time but it can neuer hinder the fruition of eternall life wherefore as we desire this life which is eternall when we are dead so let vs frame our naturall liues to die vnto sinne while we are aliue verse and others haue beene tried by mockings and scourgings yes moreouer by bonds and prisonment the second kinde of suffering wherewith the servant of god were then tried is mocking touching the which we may obserue diverse points first whence it came no doubt it came from vngodly persons that were enemy to god church amp true religion for here it is made a part of the triall of god church by the enemy thereof heere then beholde the state of mockers and scoffers at the servant of god they are heere accounted wicked wretches and enemy to god and to his truth so saint iude speaking of certaine false prophets which were crept into the church calls them vngodly man iude which hee prooues afterward by their black mouth in euill speaking verse and ismaell is accounted a persecuter by the holy ghost for mocking isaac galatians chapter verse and dauid reckoning vp the degrees of sinners makes the chaire of the scornfull the third and highest psalme all these places shew the haynousnesse of this sinne and therefore if any of vs young or olde high or lowe haue beene ouertaken with it heeretofore let vs now repent and leaue it for it is odious in god sight thou that article a scoffer mayst flat thy selfe and thinke all is well let the matter prooue how it can words are but winde but knowe thy case is fearefull for as yet thou wantest the feare of god and article an enemie to christ and his religion and one day thou shalt be iudged not onely for thy wicked deedes but for all thy cruell speakings iude verse secondly whereas these servant of god were tried by mockings it shewes that god church in this world is subiect to this affliction it is not a thing newly begunne in this age of ours but hath beene alwayes in god church from the beginning genesis chapter verse ismaell mocked isaac and isay brings in christ complaining thus isay chapter verse beholde i and my children whom the lord hath giuen me are as signes and wonders in israell and ieremie saith i am in derision daily euery one mocketh me ieremie chapter verse yes our sauiour christ vpon the crosse when hee was working the blessed worke of mans redemption was euen then mocked by the spitefull iewes mat and paul was mocked of the athenians for preaching christ and the resurrection acts now if this haue been the estate of christ our head amp of his most worthy prophets and apostles to be mocked amp scorned then must no child of god at this day think to escape for if they haue done this to the green tree what wil they doe to the dry wherefore if we belong to christ we must prepare for it and arme our selues with patience to vndergoe this triall the disciple is not aboue his master nor the servant aboue his lord if they haue called the master of the house beelzebub how much more them of the house mat thirdly whereas these servant of god were tried by mockings and did endure the same by faith here we learn how to behaue our selues when we are subiect to mocking and derision especially for religions sake we must not returne mock for mock and taunt for taunt but with meeknesse of heart learne to beare the same when christ was vpon the crosse the iewes most shamefully mocked him yet euen then did christ pray for them and the same was dauids behauiour as we may reade notably psalm verse when his enemy spake euill of him what did hee did hee raile on them againe no hee was as a deafe man and heard not and as a dumbe man which openeth not his mouth euen as a man that heareth not and in whose mouth are no reproofes this was a rare thing in dauid that he could thus bridle his affections in the case of reproach but read the verse and wee shall see the cause hee trusted in the lord his god also hee considered the hand of god in their reproaches as samuel chapter ver and these things made him silent this example we must looke vpon and learne hereby with patience to possesse our soules vnder reproach the third kinde of suffering is scourging they were not onely mocked for religion but also whipped and scourged the fourth is bonds and imprisonment the fift is stoning verse they were stoned the sixt is this they were hewen asunder these were all worthy fruits of faith being endured for religions sake but the particular points might heere be obserued haue beene handled before and therefore i pas e them ouer the seauenth kinde of suffering is this they were tempted these words by the change of a letter in the originall may be reade thus they were burned and some doe so translate it thinking that they that writ or copied out this epistle at the first did put one letter for another their reason is because examples of grieuous punishments are mentioned both before and after this and therfore they thinke this should be burning which is a sore and grieuous death but wee may safely and truly reade the words thus they were tempted conceiuing heereby that they were enticed and allured by faire promises of life to forsake their religion so the same word is vsed by saint iames saying euery man is tempted when hee is drawen away by his owne concupiscence and is enti ed iames if any aske why this kinde of triall in tempting should bee placed among such cruell torments i answere because it is as great a triall as any can be for it is as dangerous a temptation to ouerthrow religion and a good conscience as any punishment in the world this appeares plainly in christs temptations by the diuell for in those three satan bewraies his malice and craft against christ and his church most notably now satan not preuailing with the two first makes his third and last assault from the glory and dignity of the world for shewing vnto christ all the kingdomes of the world and the glory of them hee saith all these will i giue thee if thou wilt fall downe and worship me math indeede christes holy heart would not yeeld vnto it but that it was a grieuous temptation appeares by christs answeres for in the former temptations he onely disputed with satan out of scripture but when this temptation comes christ bids him as it were in passion auoide satan signifying thereby not onely his abhorring of that sinne but also the danger of that assault by the world and indeede these temptations on the right hand as wee may call them will most dangerously creepe into the heart and cause shipwracke of faith and a good conscience all dauids troubles and persecutions could not bring him to so greeuous sins as did a little ease amp rest a huge great armie cannot so soone giue entrance to an enemie into a citie as riches and faire promises neither can bodily torments so soone preuaile against a good conscience as will worldly pleasures and faire promises in regarde whereof wee must take heede that wee bee not deceiued by the world for the view of the glory and pompe thereof will sooner steale from a man both religion and good conscience then any persecution possibly can do and indeede who doe so oft change their religion when trialls come as they that haue the world at will the eight example of suffering is this they were slaine with the sword there can be nothing saide of this which hath not beene spoken in the former examples and therefore i omit it the ninth and last example of suffering is this they wandred vp and downe in sheepes skinnes and goates skinnes being destitute afflicted and tormented that is being either banished or constrained by flight to saue their liues they wandred vp and down in base attire and were destitute of ordinary foode and comfort and so in great affliction and torment heere wee see these servant of god were driuen from their owne country friends and families by persecution whence we obserue that in time of persecution a christian man may lawfully flie for his safety if hee be not hindred by the bond of priuate or publique calling for these servant of god here comended for their faith did flie when they were persecuted and that by faith therfore the action is lawful as i might prooue at large but that i haue spoken of it heeretofore vvhen our sauiour christ knewe that the pharisies heard of the multitude of disciples which he made ioh hee left iudea where they had greatest iurisdiction and came into galile for his safety the prophet in the old testament did fly as elijah from iezabel king and so did the apostles in the new and that by christs direction math obiect but some will say persecution is the hand of god amp therfore no man may flie from it for so he should seeme to flie from god himselfe ans wee must consider persecution two waies first as it is the hand of god secocondly as it is the worke of the wicked enemy of god church for them god vseth sometimes a instruments in laying his hand vpon his church either for chastisement or for triall now a christian being persecuted for the truth and hauing libertie to flie cannot bee said to flie from god hand vnlesse he went away contrary to god command as ionas did beeing sent to niniue and beside he knowes that is impossible but his intent is to flie from the wrath of his enemy to saue his life for the further good of god church again the reason is not good to say persecution is the hand of god therefore a man may not flie from it for so might a man conclude that non ought to flie from sicknesse or from war both which a man may doe with a safe conscience not beeing hindred by some speciall calling obiect but euery one is bound to testifie his faith amp religion before his enemy and therefore may not flie in persecution answer true indeede a christian man must so testifie his faith if he bee called thereto of god but if god giue him liberty and opportunitie to flie then he will not haue him at that time to iustifie his religion by that meanes obiect but if it be lawful to flie how then comes it to passe that some of god children when they might haue fled would not but haue stood to iustifie their profession vnto death ans we must iudge reueretly of the amp thinke they did it by som special instinct amp motio of god spirit as appeareth by their patience amp constancy in their greatest torments examples hereof wee haue in our english acts and monuments in man worthy of notable commendations for their constancy and zeale for the truth of the gospel quest if flight in persecution may bee an action of faith whether may not the minister of god word fly in time of persecution answer there be some cases wherein the minister may lawfully fly when that particular church and congregation ouer which he is placed is dispersed by the enemy so as he hath no hope to gather and call them back againe then no doubt hee may flie till his congregation be gathered againe if the persecutors doe specially aime at the ministers life then with the consent of his flocke he may goe apart for his owne safetie for a time so it was with paul when the ephesians were in an vproar about their diana paul in zeale would haue entred in among them but the disciples suffered him not act this they did for pauls safetie and the good of the church for they knew those idolaters would haue beene most fierce against paul and so ought euery particular church to haue speciall care of the life of their minister other cases there be in which he may flie but i will not stand to recite all because there bee so many circumstances which may alter the case as well respecting his enemy as himselfe and his people making that unlawful at one time amp to some persons which to others or at another time may be lawful secondly whereas it is said these servant of god wandred vp and downe wee doe learne that a man may lawfully go from place to place and trauell from country to country if so be he goe in faith as these man did againe their going was to keepe faith and a good conscience and for the same ende may any man lawfully trauell from place to place but when man goe not in faith nor yet for this ende the better to keepe a good conscience there vndoubtedly their trauell is not lawful by this then we haue iust cause to reprooue the badde course of many wanderers among vs as first of our common beggars whose whole life is nothing else but a wandring from place to place though not in faith nor for coscience sake but they finde a sweetnesse in their idle kind of life and therfore they wander because they would not worke now this their course hauing no other ground but loue of idlenesse and contempt of paines in a lawful calling cannot be but greatly displeasing vnto god who inioynes that euery man should walke in some lawful calling and eate his owne bread this they doe not and therefore the curse of god pursueth them for generally they are giuen vp to most horrible sinnes of iniustice and vncleannesse they walke inordinately for they range not themselues into any families but liue liker brute beastes than man they are not members of any particular congregation but excommunicate themselues from all churches and so liue as though there were no god no christ nor true religion and herein we may see god hand more heauy vpon them that they take all their delight in that course of wandring which in it owne nature is a curse amp a punishment secondly we may here also iustly reprooue the course of some others among vs who will needs be trauellers not for religions sake for that were commendable if they had such neede nor yet by vertue of their calling which were lawful but onely for this ende to see fashions and strange country and they refraine not from such places as rome spaine ampc wherein that cruell inquisition will hardly suffer any to passe with safetie of a good conscience but shall we thinke that this their trauell is commendable no surely for the ende of lawful trauell is the preseruation of faith and a good conscience r the bond of some lawful calling now these man trauelling vpon no such grounds but onely vpon pleasure how shal we think they will stand to the truth when they thrust themselues into such needlesse danger and triall the crazed consciences of many at their returne shew sufficiently the badnesse of that course further note the state of these beleeuers for their attire it was of sheep skins and goate skins the like may be obserued in other famous prophets and servant of god eliiah wore a garment of haire and thereby was knowen king and so did john baptist matth yes the false prophets went so arraied that they might the rather be respected of the people zach and our sauiour christ saith the false prophets shall come in sheeps cloathing like the true prophets when as indeede they are rauening woolues now the true prophets of god went thus basely attired that not onely by word and doctrine but also in life in conuersation they might preach repentance vnto the people and indeede euery minister of the gospell ought to bee a light vnto his people both in life and doctrine and he that preacheth well and doth not liue according to his doctrine buildes with the one hand and pulls downe with the other now whereas these servant of god went vp and downe in such base attire as sheepe skinnes and goat skinnes it was for pouerties sake beeing depriued of friends goods house and lands and so destitute of prouision for better attire in their example wee may note that god servant and children may bee brought to extreame pouerty and necessitie so as they shall want ordinary foode and raiment and bee faine to couer themselues with beast skinnes this was the poore state and condition of godly lazarus yes christ iesus for our sakes did vndergoe a meane estate for he had not a place whereon to lay his head and at his death hee had not so much ground of his owne as might serue for a buriall place but was laid in iosephs toombe which is a great comfort to any childe of god in like distresse for why should any be dismayed with that estate which christ iesus and his deerest servant haue vndergone for his example heere some may aske how this can stand with that saying of dauid i haue beene young and am olde yet i neuer saw the righteous forsaken nor his seede begging bread psalm verse answer dauids saying may be taken two wayes first as his owne obseruation in his time for he saith not the righteous is neuer forsaken but that hee neuer sawe it and indeede it is a rare thing to see the righteous forsaken secondly which i take to be dauids meaning the righteous man is neuer forsaken and his seed too for if god lay a temporall chasticement on any of his servant suffering them to want yet hee forsaketh not his seede after him but renueth his mercie towards them if they walke in obedience before him he may make triall of godly parents by want but their godly children shal surely be blessed so that this hindereth not but that the godly may be in want further whereas they are said to goe vp and downe in sheepes skinnes and goates skinnes we must vnderstand that they did it by faith from whence we learne that when all temporall blessings faile then the childe of god must by faith lay hold vpon god gracious promises of life eternal and stay himselfe thereon this point must be remembred carefully for say we should want all kind of temporall benefits must we thereupon despaire and thinke that god hath forsaken vs god forbid nay when all meanes faile and the whole world is against vs yet then we must lay holde vpon the promise of life eternall in christ and thereupon rest our soules thus did these beleeuers in this place and this faith did iob notably testifie when god had taken from him children goods health yes and all that he had yet then he said iob though he kill me yet will i trust in him and so must wee endeuour to doe if that case befall vs for when all worldly helpes and comforts faile vs this promise of life in christ will be a sweet and safe refuge for our soule being destitute afflicted and tormented here the apostle amplifieth their misery in their wadring estate by three degrees of crosses which did accompany the same first they were destitute of all temporall blessings secondly they were afflicted both in body and minde thirdly tormented that is euill entreated these are added for a speciall cause to shew that these servant of god were laden with afflictions they were banished amp driuen to extreme pouerty they were depriued of all their goods and of all society of man they were afflicted in body and in minde and euill entreated of all man no man would doe them good but all man did them wrong whereby we see that euen waues of miseries ouerwhelmed them on euerie side hence wee learne that god servant may be ouerwhelmed with manifolde calamities at the same instant being pressed down with crosses in goods in body minde friends and euery way this was iobs case a most worthy servant of god he was afflicted in body in friends goods amp childre amp which was greatest of all he wrestled in coscience with the wrath of god iob thou writest bitter things against me and makest mee to possesse the iniquities of my youth and the like hath beene the state of many of god children psalm my soule is filled with euils thou hast vexed me with all thy waues ampc question how can this stand with the truth of god word wherein are promises of all manner of blessings both temporall and spirituall to those that feare him deut ampc if thou obey the voyce of the lord thy god all these blessings shall come vpon thee and ouertake thee blessed in the citie and in the field in the fruite of thy body and of thy ground and cattell psalm they that seeke the lord shall lacke nothing that is good for godlinesse hath the promises of this life and of the life to come tim and therefore dauid compareth the godly man to the tree that is planted by the water side which bringeth forth much fruite and is greene and well liking psalme how then comes this to passe that god owne servant should be thus oppressed and laden not with one calamity or two but with sundry and grieuous afflictions at the same time answer true it is the scripture is full of gracious promises of temporal blessings vnto god children but they are conditionall and must be vnderstoode with an exception to this effect god children shall haue such and such blessings vnlesse it please god by afflictions to make triall of his graces in them or to chastise them for some sinne so that the exception of the crosse for the triall of grace or chastisement for sinne must be applied to all promises of temporall blessings and hence it comes to passe that the most worthy amp renowned servant of god for their faith are said to be afflicted and in miserie for his promises of temporall blessings are not absolute but conditionall all things are theirs as paul saith corinthian and they shall haue honour wealth fauour ampc vnlesse it please god to proue their faith or to chastice their sinnes by crosses and afflictions question how can god servant be able to beare so many and grieuous crosses at once seeing it is hard for a man to beare one crosse patiently the answere is heere laid downe to wit by faith for many and grieuous were the miseries that lay on these servant of god and yet by beleeuing the promise of life in the messias they were enabled to beare them all this is a soueraine remedy against immoderate griefe in the greatest distresse and vndoubtedly the flouds of affliction shall neuer ouerwhelme him that hath his heart assured by faith of the mercy of god towards him by iesus christ this made dauid say he would not feare euill though he should walke through the valley of the shadow of death psalm and paul speaking of tribulation anguish famine persecution yes and death it selfe saith in all these we are more then conquerers through him that hath loued rom and from this faith it was that hee was able to endure all estates to be hungry to want ampc philipp if this be true that god children may be afflicted with manifolde calamities at once then the opinion of naturall and vngodly man is false who iudge him to be wicked and vngodly whom god ladeth with manifolde calamities this was the iudgement of iobs three friends and the ground of all their disputation against him that because god had laid so great and so many crosses vpon him therfore he was but an hypocrite and this is the rash iudgement of naturall man in our dayes especially vpon those that make profession of religion when god hand of triall or correction lies vpon them they presently censure them for hypocrites but this is a wretched opinion for god dearest children may be pressed downe with manifold calamities secondly seeing faith in christ will support the soule vnder manifolde crosses be they neuer so grieuous wee must labour in the feare of god to haue our hearts rooted and grounded in this faith and when afflictions come we must striue to shew forth the fruite and power of it by bearing them patiently and thus much of the seuerall branches of affliction in this last example of beleeuers whom the world was not worthy of they wandred in the wildernesse and mountaines and dens and caues of the earth in these words the holy ghost doth answere to a secret obiection or surmise which a naturall ma might coceiue against the beleeuers spoken of before for it being said that they wandred vp and downe some man might thinke thus no meruaile though they wandred vp and down for it may be they were not worthy to liue in the worlde this the holy ghost doth flatly denie and auoucheth the cleane contrary of them to wit that they wandred vp and downe by faith and the lord caused them so to doe because the world was not worthy of them they were too good to liue in the world in this answere to this surmise wee may obserue what is the opinion of naturall man concerning the children of god to wit that they are not worthy to liue in the world but the earth whereon they tread is too good for them this hath beene is and will be the worldes estimation of god children matthew chapter verse ye shall be hated of all nation for my names sake john chapter verse they shall excommunicate you yes the time shall come that whosoeuer killeth you shall thinke hee doth god good seruice acts chapter verse away say the iewes of paul with such a followe from the earth it is not meete that he should liue and hence hee saith of himselfe and the other apostles corinthians chapter verse they were made the filth of the worlde and the off scouring of all things in the time of the persecuting emperours in the primitiue church when any common calamity befell the people or state as famine dearth pestilence or such like they straight way imputed it to the christians saying that they and their wicked religion were the cause thereof and though wee haue religion maintained among vs yet the poore servant of god finde the like welcom in the world for thus the wicked censure them euery where that they are dissembling hypocrites and none so bad and vile persons as they are now if any man aske how comes it to passe that the world should slander them so and thinke so vilely of them answer first because they be taken out of the world in regard of state and condition in grace ioh therefore the world hateth them ioh secondly the world knowes them not io and therefore speakes evil of them iude thirdly the wicked measure others by themselues and therefore despise the godly that ioyn not with them pet lastly there is a secret enmitie betweene the seed of the wicked amp the seede of the church ioh the wicked are of that euill one the diuell and therefore must needes hate the godly who are borne of god so that when wee shall see or heare that vngodly persons shall in any such sort abuse the children of god we must not maruell nor be troubled at it for it is no newe thing it hath been from the beginning but we must pray that god would open their eies that they might turne from their sinnes to repentance and then no doubt they will change their conceit and alter their behauiour towards them as paul did gal act to come to the words more particularly the holy ghost saith the world was not worthy of them that is the company of vngodly liuers without christ and voyde of grace were not worthy the societie of these holy ones amp for this cause did the lord take them from among them here note a singular fruite of true faith it brings a man to that estate and giues him that excellency that hee is more worth than the whole world i meane by the whole world the estate of all those that liue in the world out of christ if then a man would haue true and stable dignity let him labour for true faith for faith hath this priuiledge to aduance a beleeuer to true honour amp excellency and therefore our sauiour saith as many as receiued him by faith to them he gaue power or prerogatiue to bee the sonnes of god we take it for a great prerogatiue to be the childe of an earthly prince and so it is but to be the son of god who is king of kings is a preheminence and dignitie aboue all dignities and no tongue can expresse the excellency therof for what more can a man desire than to bee heire of glory in life euerlasting and yet true faith bringeth this to a beleeuer it is an excellent dignity to be matched with angels and no prince in the world by all humane wit or power can attaine vnto it but yet the childe of god can being ioyned to god by faith in christ wherby in some sort he is aboue the angels themselues for our nature in christ is aduanced aboue the nature of angels honours and dignities in politicke or ciuill estates are the good gifts of god and his owne ordinances wherby man are in higher places and in account are aboue another but yet all the dignity honour and pompe of the world seuered from that dignitie which faith bringeth to the beleeuer is nothing worth indeed if worldly preheminence be ioyned with faith it is a great and excellent prerogatiue for faith makes it acceptable vnto god but seuer faith from worldly dignities and what are they but vanitie of vanities which will turne to the greater condemnation of him that enioyeth them if a man haue fauour in the court and yet want the kings fauour it is nothing and such are all temporall dignities without god fauour for at his indignation they vanish away now his fauour without faith can no man haue for he that commeth vnto god must beleeue verse here all these that are in place aboue others either by birth or speciall calling must learne aboue all things to labour for the dignity of faith when wee haue such things wherein we delight wee desire continuance of them behold the dignity of faith is euerlasting and besides it sanctifies all ciuill dignities and makes the owners of them glorious amp acceptable both before god and man when as otherwise without faith they are nothing and they that haue them can doe nothing but abuse them againe the holy ghost saith the world was not worthy of these man for another cause and that is this euery christian man by his faith brings many blessings among those parties and to that place where he liueth now the world deserues no such blessings and therefore is vnworthy of the persons by whom they come question how doe christians bring blessings to places where they liue answere first by their presence for as god saide to abraham the father of the faithfull thou shalt be a blessing gen so is it with all beleeuers laban confesseth that hee perceiued that the lord had blessed him for iacobs sake gen and potiphar sawe that ioseph was a blessing in his house for the lord made all that he did to prosper gen while lot was in sodome the angell could not destroy it gen and if there had beene tenne beleeuers in sodome the lord would haue spared all for tennes sake gen now bringing good things and keeping backe god iudgements by their presence they are thereby blessings secondly they are blessings by their prayers abraham prayed for abimelech gen and god healed him and his family of barrennesse at moses prayer god iudgements were taken from egypt exod and his wrath appeased toward his people exod and some thinke that stephens prayer at his death for his persecuters was one meanes for mercy vnto saul that then consented to his death acts and thirdly they bring blessings vpon a place by their example for when man shall see godly persons walking before them in the feare of god and making conscience of all manner of sinne it is a speciall meanes to cause others to turne from their wicked wayes to newnesse of life and therefore peter exhorts the christians to haue their conuersation honest among the gentiles that they which speake euill of them as of euill doers might by their good workes which they should see glorifie god in the day of their visitation pet and he bids godly wiues so walke that their husbands may be wonne without the word by beholding their pure conuersation which is with feare pet and paul bids the philippians to walke blamelesse in the middle of a wicked and crooked nation as lights in the middle of the world philipp that those which were to be conuerted by their good conuersation might be wonne to the truth god sent a floud vpon the world for the greeuousnesse of mans sinnes now why doth hee not still send more flouds are not man now as wicked as they were then yes vndoubtedly man for his part deserues it now as well as they did then and therfore our sauiour christ saith as it was in the dayes of noah so shall it be in the dayes of the son of man so that euery day we deserue a new floud but yet the lord stayes the execution of his iudgements for a time that his elect may bee gathered and conuerted and so soone as that is done heauen and earth shall goe together and god will not stay one moment for all the world besides so that euery nation and people in the world haue benefit by god children because for their sakes doth the lord stay his wrath and deferre his iudgements euen the great iudgement of fire wherewith the world shall be consumed at the last day these things the world should take notice of as well to moue them to repentance of their sinnes whereby they are made vnworthy the presence of a godly man as also to perswade them to better behauiour and cariage towards the godly by whom they are so many wayes blessed the holy ghost addeth that they wandred in wildernesse and mountaines and donnes and caues of the earth these were desolate places and not inhabited and yet for the wickednesse of the world god will haue these beleeuer here to wander wee must not thinke that they betooke themselues voluntarily to this solitary life but onely vpon necessity being constrained by persecution to flie into the wildernesse for the sauing of their liues and the keeping a good conscience this serues to descry vnto vs the blinde errour of many ages afore vs wherein it hath beene thought and is by papists at this day to bee a state of perfection to liue a monke or hermite out of all societies in some desert place and there to spend the whole life in contemplation onely amp that voluntarily and they magnifie this estate so much that heereby they thinke to merit eternall life at the hands of god but these beleeuers did neither voluntarily nor with opinion of merit betake themselues to this solitarie life but on necessity and indeede this kinde of life hath no warrant in god word for euery christian is a member of two kingdomes of christs kingdome of grace and of that particular state where he dwelleth and by reason heereof hath a two folde calling a temporall and a spirituall calling in both of which he must walke diligently so long as hee can doing the duties both of a childe of god and of a member of that common wealth where hee liueth now when a man goes voluntarily to leade a solitary life he forsakes his temporall calling altogether and performes the other but negligently for hee withdrawes himselfe from many duties of piety whereby the people might be furthered to god ward which none can do with a good conscience further obserue the places where they are constrained to wander to wit in wildernesse caues and dennes places where wilde beast haue abode and recourse and yet heere they liue when as man will not suffer them to liue among them where note that many times more mercy may be found among wilde and savage beast than with some man so mercilesse are the wicked when god forsakes them and leaues them to themselues the lions entreate daniel better than darius courtiers and servant doe daniel chapter and lazarus findes more kindenesse with the dogges at diues gates then with him and all his family besides luke chapter verse the consideration whereof must teach vs to nippe sinne in the head at the beginning and not to suffer it to growe for if it get a head and raigne in vs it will make vs worse than brute or savage beast and cruell as the diuell himselfe as wee may see in the worldes vsage of these beleeuers thus we see the state of true beleeuers vnder many and greeuous miseries which wee must well obserue to arme our selues against the times of aduersities which god may sende vpon vs vvee must not iudge it a cursed estate to bee vnder the crosse for heere wee see the faith of his servant is commended for suffering nine seuerall kindes of miseries if wee shall thinke that these were but a fewe wee must knowe that in them the holy ghost setteth down the state of his church vnto the end for these things were written for ensamples vnto vs and therefore if calamities come and such miseries befall vs as doe driue vr toward distrust as though god had forsaken vs we must remember that god did not forsake these his children in their calamities and therefore also will not forsake vs and thus much for this last example and these all through faith obtained good report and recei not the promise the holy ghost hauing set down at large a worthie and notable catalogue of examples of faith in sundry beleeuers that liued from the beginning of the world to the time of the maccabees doth now for a further commendation of their faith rehearse the same things that before he had said in the and verses of this chapter in saying that by faith they all receiued good report his meaning is that they did beleeue in the true messias and looked for saluation in him alone whereupon they were approoued of god himselfe who gaue testimonie hereof partly by his word and partly by his spirit in their consciences and partly by his church by all which they were commended and assured to be god servant and yet notwithstanding this good report they receiued not the promise that is the promise of christs incarnation in their daies they receiued christ truely by faith and so saw his day but his actual incarnation in the flesh they liued not to see whereas it is said that by faith they obtained testimony here first obserue that there is nothing in man that makes him acceptable to god but faith onely god regards no mans person hee accepts not of a man because he is a king or because he is wise or rich or strong ampc but if a man beleeue then the lord is ready to giue testimony of him that hee likes well of him in regard whereof wee must all labour diligently aboue all other things to get true faith in christ that so we may haue approbation at god hands without which there is no saluation to be hoped for secondly here also learne the right way to get testimony approbation and credit with man a thing whereof many are exceeding glad and which the childe of god must not contemne now the way is this he must first labour to get approbation at god hands which indeede hee cannot doe any other way saue onely by a true and liuely faith as wee haue heard before now the lord god approouing of him hee hath the hearts of all man in his hands inclining them whither hee will and if it doth stand with his glory hee will cause them to like and to speake well of him that doth beleeue many indeede get great applause in the world which little regard true faith but in the ende this their glory and applause will be their shame for they that honour me will i honour saith the lord but he that despiseth me shal be despised sam lastly whereas the holy ghost saith that all these worthy man obtained testimony of god and yet receiued not the promise we are hereby taught that we which now liue in the church are much more bound in conscience to beleeue than they that liued in the old testament for wee haue receiued the promise of christs incarnation they receiued it not and yet beleeued wherefore in the feare of god let vs labour for true faith but some wil say what should we heare so much of faith we do all beleeue answer indeed we say so much with our mouthes but it is a rare thing to finde true and sound faith in the heart for gros e and palpable ignorance abounds euery where and yet man wil needs be good beleeuers which is a thing impossible for how should faith be without knowledge and as man are ignorant so they haue no care to learne nor to get knowledge that so they might come by true faith their hearts are wholly take vp with the world for matters of profit and delight that they can spare no time to seeke for this pretious gift of faith againe many haue knowledge with whom true faith is rare for faith purifies the heart it is ioyned with a good conscience and shewes it selfe by obedience through loue now to leaue the heart to god where almost is the man that walkes answerable to his knowledge may we not truely say of many that as the word commeth in at the one eare it goeth out at the other and among those which learne and beare away something there is little care to practice it in life but wee must knowe that if wee would be approoued of god wee must beleeue now so long as wee remaine ignorant or else hauing knowledge doe not ioyne practice therewith in obedience from a good conscience vndoubtedly we haue no sparke of true faith in vs wee may make a shewe of faith and so beare the world in hand we beleeue but certainely this will prooue a very dead faith and in the ende and finishing of all appeare to bee nothing but bare lip faith and meere presumption now to conclude this point we must know that vnlesse wee get true faith as these beleeuers had which wee must shewe by good fruits as they did euen they shall rise vp in iudgemet against vs to condemne vs at the last day for they beleeued though they had not the ground of faith so laid before them as we haue wherefore let them that want knowledge labour for it and they which haue it let them ioyne obedience with their knowledge that the faith of their hearts may be seene by the fruits of their liues for true faith cannot bee hid but will breake out in good workes god prouiding a better thing for vs that they without vs should not be made perfect because some man might much maruel that such man as receiued testimony of god for their faith should not yet receiue the promise therefore here the holy ghost renders a reason thereof to wit the good pleasure of god appointing that christ should bee incarnate at such a time as was most conuenient for the perfect consummation of the whole church consisting of gentiles as well as iewes for though these ancient beleeuers were in time long before vs yet god prouided christs incarnation so fitly for vs that they without vs should not haue perfect consummation in glory the exposition god prouiding a better thing for vs the word in the originall translated prouiding signifieth properly foreseeing wherein is likewise included god decree and ordination now this we must knowe that it is a peculiar prerogatiue belonging to the true god alone to be able to foresee things to come and that many thousand years before no creature of himselfe can doe it and yet it is true that this propertie to foresee is ascribed vnto god not properly but in regard of our capacitie for if we speake of god properly god cannot be said to foresee any thing because all things bee present to him whether past or to come this prescience or foreknowledge in god puts a difference betweene the true god and all false god yes betweene the true god and all creatures for the true god foresees all things that are to come so can no creature doe indeed some creatures foresee and foretell some things yet herein they come short of the diuine property for god foresees all things by himselfe without signes or causes or outward meanes but creatures onely foresee some things not of themselues but by meanes of signes and outward causes or by reuelation from god otherwise can no creature foresee things to come now as we said before this fore sight in god includes his decree and ordination for therefore did these things so come to passe because god ordained them whereby we see that god prescience of fore knowledge is not idle but operatiue and ioyned with his will for math an haire cannot fall from our head nor a sparrow light vpon the ground without his will as all things in time come to passe so god before all worlds willed that is decreed and appointed them and vnder this large extent of god will or decree wee must include the sinnefull actions of man for god doth not barely foresee them but decree the beeing of them and so will them after a sort though not to be done by himselfe yet by others when iudas betrayed christ and pilate with the wicked iewes condemned and reuiled him they sinned grieuously amp yet herein they did nothing but that which god hand and counsell had determined before to be done this point well considered confutes their opinion who indeed inlarge god prescience or fore knowledge ouer all things both good and euill but yet exclude sin from without the compasse of his decree and ordination but here we see god foresight includes his decree and nothing comes to passe simply without his will howsoeuer many things bee done against his reuealed will yet without his absolute will can nothing come to passe hee worketh all things according to the counsell of his owne will doing himselfe those things that bee good and willingly permitting euill to bee done by others for good ends but what did god here prouide amp foresee for vs ans a better thing that is god in his eternall counsell prouided a better estate for his church in the newe testament than he did for beleeuers in the olde hence we learne that as god hath his generall prouidence whereby he gouerneth all things so also hee hath his speciall and particular prouidence whereby in all things hee prouides and brings to passe that which is best for his church for in the olde testament god prouided that for his church which was meete for it but considering that the church in the new testament in som respects was to haue a better estate than the church in the olde testament had therefore he prouides for it a better state and looke as in his eternall wisdome he foreseeth what is best for all estates and times so in his prouidence doth he accomplish and effect the same for vs that is for the church in the newe testament where note that god church and the state thereof in the new testament is better than it was in the old before the comming of christ the holy ghost here speakes this plainely and therefore we need no further proofe therof qu how should it be better with the church now tha it was then ans true it is that god gaue the couenant of grace in the beginning to our first parents in paradise the summe whereof was this the seed of the woman shall breake the serpents head and this couenant did god renue and reuiue vnto his church from time to time in all ages vnto this day both circumcision and the passeouer were seales of this couenant as well as our sacraments bee so that in substance they differ not the free gift of grace in christ belonged to them as well as vnto vs the beleeuing iewes in their sacraments did eate the same spirituall meate and drinke the same spirituall drinke with vs as the apostle witnesseth corinthians chapter verse and beleeuers then obtained the same eternall life that wee doe now by faith and yet if wee regarde the manner of administring the couenant of grace in god church vnto the people of god heerein doth the church of the new testament farre surpasse the church of god in the olde and indeede heerein consists the preheminence of the church vnder the gospell which stands in fiue things especially first in the olde testament spirituall and heauenly were propounded vnto the church vnder temporall and earthly blessings this is plaine by god dealing with the patriarchs abraham isaac and iacob for the lord promised vnto them the temporal blessings of the land of canaan vnder which hee signified the gift of life euerlasting in the kingdome of heauen but in the new testament life euerlasting is plainly promised to the beleeuer without any such type or figure secondly in the old test christ was shewed amp signified vnto them in ceremonies rites and types which were in number many and in signification some of them dark and obscure but now these types and ceremonies are abolished the shadowe is gone and the substance come and in steade of darke signes and figures wee haue two most plaine and sensible sacraments more plainely the couenant of grace in the olde testament was sealed by the bloud of lambs as signes of the bloud of christ but now to his church in the new testament christ himselfe hath sealed his testament by his owne bloud thirdly in the olde testament all the knowledge they had was in the law and their vnderstanding in the gospel was obscure and very slender but in the new testament not onely the law is made manifest but also the supernaturall knowledge of the gospell fourthly the law was onely committed and published to one nation and people but the gospell is spred and preached to all the world and lastly the church in the olde testament beleeued in christ to come but now the church beleeues in christ which is already come amp exhibited in all which respects the church in the new testament doth exceed the church of the olde now where the text saith god prouided a better thing for vs we must not vnderstand it of all these prerogatiues but onely of the first and last touching the actuall exhibiting of christ in the flesh as christ also imports luke blessed are the eyes which see that ye see for i tel you many prophets and kings haue desired to see those things ye see and haue not seene them which things we must vnderstand of the incarnation of christ and that this is such a prerogatiue to the new testament appeareth by olde simeon who when hee had seene christ in the temple as it was promised to him sang vnto god this song luke lord now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace according to thy word for mine eyes haue seene thy saluation as if he should say i haue now lord liued long enough let mee now depart in peace seeing now i haue seene thy christ my sauiour where wee see hee makes it a matter of full contentment vnto his soule which the beleeuers vnder the law saw not hence we must learne our duty for if our state be now better then the state of the olde testament was and if wee enioy priuiledges denied to god ancient servant before and vnder the law then vndoubtedly we ought to striue to go before them in grace and obedience for euery mans accounts shal be according to his receites he that receiues fiue talents must make account to returne moe than hee that receiues two where god is more aboundant in his mercy there he lookes for answerable thankfulnesse and obedience wee goe beyond the auncient church in fiue things and therfore we must stirre vp our hearts to be answerable in grace and obedience going beyonde them but if for all this wee come short of them in these things then surely our case is fearefull and our punishment shall be the greater for they that had lesse prerogatiues shall be witnesses against vs if they goe beyonde vs in obedience that they without vs might not be made perfect that is might not be fully glorified heere is the reason why christ was not exhibited in their dayes indeede all true beleeuers before christ were iustified and sactified and in soule receiued to glory before vs yet perfected in soule and body both they must not be before vs but wee must all be perfected together now his will herein hee bringeth thus to passe all must be perfected in christ but he will not haue christ to come and suffer till the fullnesse of time came in these last dayes heb as the apostle speaketh that the beleeuers liuing in these last dayes might haue time of being in the church to be called iustified and sanctified that so they might bee glorified with them that liued before for put the case that christ had suffered in the dayes of abraham or dauid or there about then the end of the world must needes haue come the sooner for so it was foretolde that christ should come in the later ages of the world pet now if the world had beene sooner cut off then had there not beene time of birth and calling for all the elect that now liue and shall liue therefore for their sakes was christs comming deferred till the fulnesse of time and this i take to be the meaning of the words now in that the holy ghost here saith the members of christ in the new testament must bee perfected with all the ancient beleeuers in the olde wee must heereby be admonished to conforme our selues vnto these ancient fathers in the participation of grace amp practice of obedience in this life for how can we looke to be glorified with them after this life if heere wee be not like them in grace christ tells his followers that many should come from the east and from the west to sit with abraham isaac and iacob in the kingdome of heauen math because they were followers of these patriarchs in the faith when as the children of the kingdome that is many iewes by birth borne in the church should be cast into vtter darknesse now if christ denie to glorifie the children and posterity of these ancient beleeuers because they did not follow them in grace and in obedience how can we which are by nature sinners of the gentiles looke to bee glorified with them vnlesse in grace and obedience we conforme our selues vnto them thus much for these examples of faith now something must be added out of the next chapter because there the holy ghost makes vse of all these worthy examples wherfore let vs also seeing wee are compassed with so great a clowd of witnesses cast away euery thing that presseth down and that sinne that hangeth so fast on let vs runne with patience the race that is set before vs in these words the holy ghost propoundeth a worthy exhortation to the christians of the newe testament that they should labour to be constant in the profession of the faith that is in holding embracing and beeleeuing true christian religion and his reason is framed thus the saints of god in the olde testament were constant in the faith and therefore you must likewise be constant in the faith that liue in the new testament the first part of the reason is laid downe in all the exaples of the former chapter the conclusion or sequel is contained in this verse wherein wee may obserue two points an exhortation vnto constancy in true religion and the way or meanes to attaine thereunto the exhortation is inferred vpon the former examples which are all here applied as precedents and directions vnto vs for constancy and perseuerance in the faith in these words wherefore seeing we are compassed about with such a cloud of witnesses that is seeing abel enoch noe abraham and all the rest of the holy fathers who are a clowd of witnesses vnto vs that is lights and leaders before vs were constant in true religion whether we respect their faith in god promises or obedience to his commandements therefore we also must be constant in the faith the way or meanes hereunto stands in three duties in the words following let vs cast away ampc for the exhortation first in generall the very inferring of it from the former examples teacheth vs this speciall duty that euery one in god church must apply vnto himselfe those instructions that are laid downe either generally in doctrine or particularly in example and therfore the holy ghost here saith not let the galatians or the corinthians which were renowmed churches bee constant in the faith but let vs that is you hebrewes with my selfe bee constant in the faith following the example of your ancient fathers it is said of the ancient iewes that many of them heard god word but it was not profitable vnto them because it was not mingled with faith in them what is it to mingle the word with faith it is not onely to receiue it by faith beleeuing it to be true but also by the same hand of faith to apply it to a mans own soule to his heart and life and vndoubtedly god word thus applied to a mans particular person hath in it great power and fruite whether we regard information of iudgement or reformation of life but it is a hard thing to doe and rare to finde a man that doth sincerely apply vnto himselfe either generall doctrines or particular examples we are all prone to shift it from our selues and to lay it vpon others saying this is a good item or a good lesson for such a one or such a one if hee were here or if he would marke it in the meane while what benefit reape we to our owne soules for the word not applied to our selues doth vs no good it is like physicke not taken or food not eaten and hence it coms to passe that though we heare much yet wee profit little by the ministery of god word we must therefore learne to follow maries example who pondered christs words and laid them vp in her owne heart when an exhortation is giue we must not post it off and lay it vpon others mens shoulders but apply it to our selues and lay it to our owne hearts saying this instruction is for me hereby no doubt wee should feele greater blessings vpon the preaching of the word than yet wee doe and to mooue vs hereunto let vs consider that satan our vtter enemie who seekes nothing but our destruction is most busie to hinder this application of the word either by the minister or by a mans owne conscience as for example when the minister by occasion out of god word shall confute either errour in iudgement or misdemeanour in life then man that heare and are guilty thereof should say this is mine errour or my fault now am i confuted or reproued and god no doubt if man would thus do would make it effectuall vnto them at the length but in stead of this applying to our selues either through our owne corruption or satans suggestion or both we shift it from our selues and say now hee reprooues such a one and such a one and speakes against such and such and indeed satan by his good will would neuer haue a man to apply the word rightly to himselfe therefore seeing satan is so busie and this is his deceit to make a man shift off an exhortation or reproofe from himselfe and to lay it on others wee must be as carefull to apply it to our selues and to lay it to our owne consciences and then no doubt we shall finde it to be a word of power able to reforme both the misdemeanour of our liues and the errours of our mindes now to the reason more particularly wee must be constant in the faith because we are compassed about with so great a cloude of witnesses heere the ancient fathers of the olde testament which in the former chapter were commended vnto vs for their faith are compared to a cloude and then to a cloude compassing vs lastly to a cloude of witnesses they are compared to a cloude as i take it by allusion to the cloud which directed and led the israelites in the wildernesse for when they came from egypt and were yeares in the desert of arabia all that while they were directed by a pillar of cloud by day exod now looke as this cloud guided the israelites from the bondage of egypt to the land of canaan so doth this company of famous beleeuers direct all the true members of god church in the new testament the right way from the kingdome of darknesse to the spirituall canaan the kingdome of heauen and this is the true cause why these worthy beleeuers are compared to a cloud mark further they are called a cloud but what a cloude namely compassing vs a compassing cloud they are called by reason of the great company of beleeuers so as which way soeuer a man turnes him hee shall see beleeuers on euery side and they are said to compasse vs because they giue vs direction in the course of christianity as the cloud did the israelites in the wildernesse now wheras the whole company of beleeuers is called a cloud compassing vs heere is answered a comon obiection of temporizers which argue thus against religio there are so many kindes of religion now a dayes that no man can tell which to be of and therefore it is good to be of no religion till we be certified which is y e true religion this carnall reason is here answered for howsoeuer in som things there be variety of opinions in god church yet for the substance of religion all agree in one for the company of beleeuers in this world resembles a cloud that goes before vs shewing vs the right way which we are to walke in to the kingdome of heauen secondly in that these ancient beleeuers are called a cloud compassing vs we are taught that as y e israelites did follow the cloud in the wildernes fro the land of egypt to canaan so must we follow the example of these ancient beleeuing fathers amp prophets to the kingdom of heauen it is a strange thing to see how the israelites followed that cloud they neuer went till it went before them and when it stood still they stood still also though it were yeares together and when it began to moue they moued with it so in the same maner must we set before our eyes for a pattern of life the worthy examples of beleeuers in the old testament for whatsoeuer was written was written for our learning we must therfore be followers of them in faith obedience and other graces of god and so shall we be directed to life euerlasting in the spirituall canaan the kingdom of heauen and yet we must not follow the absolutely for all of the had their infirmities amp som of the had their grieuous faults wherby they were tainted amp their comendation somwhat blemished but we must follow them in the practice of faith amp other graces of god the cloud that guided the israelites had two parts a light part amp a dark the egyptians who were enemy to god people had not the light part before them but the dark part amp so following that they rushed into the red sea amp were drowned whe as the israelites folowing the light part went through in safety euen so these beleeuers had in them two things their sins which be their darke part which if we follow we cast our soules into great danger amp destruction and faith with other graces of god which are their light part which we must follow as our light which if we doe carefully it will bring vs safe to the kingdome of heauen so paul bids the corinthians be followers of him yet not absolutely in euery thing but as he followes christ and so must we follow the fathers as they went on in faith in christ further they are a cloud of witnesses that is a huge multitude of witnesses and they are so called first because by their owne bloud they confirmed the faith which they professed secondly because they did all confirme the doctrine of true religion whereof they were witnesses partly by speaches and partly by actions in life and conuersation and so is euery member of christ a witnesse as the lord often calls the beleeuing israelites his witnesses quest how came this to passe that these beleeuers should bee god witnesses answere surely because they testified the truth and excellencie of god holy religion both in word and action in life and conuersation now seeing these in the olde testament were christs witnesses first hereby all ignorant persons must be stirred vp to be carefull to get faith and to learne true religion if any thing will moue a man to become religious this will for out of all the world god will chuse faithfull man to be his witnesses to testifie of his religion vnto others if a man were perswaded that some worthy mighty prince would vouchsafe to call him to beare witnesse of the truth on his side he would be wonderfull glad thereof and take it for a great honour to him how much more then ought wee to labour for knowledge faith and obedience in true religion that we may become witnesses vnto the lord our god if it be a dignity to be witnesse to an earthly prince oh then what a great prerogatiue is this for a silly sinfull man to becom a witnesse to the truth of the euerliuing god who is king of kings amp whose word needes no confirmation this must make vs al to labour for knowledge amp for faith and for the power of religion but if we wil remaine stil in our ignorance and neuer labour for knowledge then shall these servant of god that beleeued in the olde testament stand vp and witnesse against vs at the day of iudgement for they had not such meanes as we haue and yet they became most faithfull witnesses secondly this must teach vs to be careful that as in word we professe christ so indeed we may confesse him expressing the power of his grace in vs for by this true confession of christ we are made his witnesses but when wee confesse christ in word onely and yet in life amp practice denie him then we are vnfaithful witnesses for we say amp vnsay in an earthly court if a ma should one while say one thing amp another while another thing he would not be accepted for a witnesse but rather be excepted against as altogether vnworthy and so would prooue a discredit to his friends cause amp a shame to himself so it is with vs in christs cause if we professe in word amp deny indeed we discredit christ and his profession amp shame our selues for euer and therfore we must be carefull not only in word and iudgement but in life amp conuersation to make a true amp constant confession of christ and of his truth and thus much for the exhortation now followeth the point to be obserued in this verse namely the manner how god church amp people may put in practice this worthy exhortation of the holy ghost to be constant in the faith and this consists in three duties they must cast away that which presseth downe they must cast away that sin that hangeth so fast on or sin which so readily doth compasse vs about they must run the race that is set before them with patience whosoeuer in god church either iew or gentile can performe these things shall be able no doubt to follow the counsell of the holy ghost amp cotinue costant in the faith vnto y e end of these in order the thing then to be done is this we must cast away that which presseth down or thus cast away the waight or burthen for so much the word in the originall signifieth euen that burthen which so presseth down the poore christian that he cannot goe on forward in the course of godlinesse and christianity by burthen or weight here we must vnderstand things the loue of this temporall life care for earthly things riches amp temporal wealth worldly honour amp preferments worldly delights and pleasures all these are things which lie heauy on mans soule as weighty burthens which presse it downe especially then when the soule should lift vp it self to seek heauenly things so in the parable of the sower riches pleasures amp cares for the things of this life are called thornes which choake the word of god in a mans heart and make it vnfruitfull and surfetting amp drunkennes are said to be things which oppress the heart and make it heauy and easie it were to shewe by many testimonies that all these fiue things do press down the heart especially then when it should be lifted vp in the seeking of heauenly things now in this that these things are waighty burdens we may learne first what is the cause that in these our daies euery where the gospel of christ being published preached amp expouded takes so little place in mes hearts whether we regard knowledge amp vnderstanding or affection and obedience for god word is a word of power mighty in operation how comes it to passe then that the ground is barren where it is cast why makes it not man learned amp religious ans surely in euery place where the word of god is preached especially among vs these fiue things possess the hearts of man amp exercise all the thoghts of the minde and affections of the heart from whence it commeth to passe that after long preaching there is little fruit or profit either for knowledge or obedience for where the heart is pressed downe with the waight of these earthly things there the word of god can take no place nor bring forth fruit and this is generally true among vs though we heare god word from year to year and thereby might increase in knowledg amp obediece if we would yet in many there is little shew of either and the cause is in these worldly cares which take place in our hearts for this is a most certaine truth that so long as our hearts are addicted to the greedy seeking after these earthly things honour pleasures ampc so long will the ground of our hearts bee barren the good seed of god word may be sowen therein but little fruit shall come thereof saue briers and weeds which will increase our damnation again whereas the loue of teporal life amp care of earthly things ampc are sore burdens pressing downe a mans heart from heauen to earth and making it heauy and sad and dead in regard of all spirituall exercises and contemplations hereby we are taught oftentimes to giue our selues to eleuate and lift vp our mindes and hearts to god partly by meditation in his word partly by inuocation on his name and partly by thanksgiuing and to doe these things the better we must remember to set apart some speciall time euery day for this speciall worke so as we may say with dauid psalm lord i lift vp my heart vnto thee dauid was well acquinted with this exercise and so was daniel for both of them vsed this as we may read psalm euening and morning saith dauid and at noone wil i pray amp make a noyse and daniel vsed to pray vnto god times a day wherein he would heartily amp vnfainedly call vpon god with thanksgiuing and great reason we should do so for wee liue in this world wherein are innumerable waighty things which press down our hearts fro looking vp to heauen amp therfore we must often practice our selues in holy meditatio amp prayer vnto god that so we may lift vp our soules vnto god from the things of this world to vse a fit copariso we know that those who keep clocks if they would haue the clock stil going must once or twice a day winde vp the plumets which cause the wheels to go about because they are still drawing downward euen so seeing our hearts haue plummets of lead which are worldly cares and desires to press them down from seeking vp to heauen we must doe with our hearts as the clock keeper doth with his plummets winde them vp vnto god euery day amp for this ende must set apart some particular time to do the same in holy duties why doth god command the day to be sanctified and set apart from all bodily exercises amp worldly cares vndoubtedly it is for this end to cause man to eleuate their hearts from all wordly things to seeke the things aboue else if the minde should be alwaies pressed down with worldly cares it could neuer attain to heaues ioys he that hath not cosciece on the lord day to lift vp his heart to heauen by prayer and hearing god word with meditation theron cannot possibly haue any soundnes in religion nor his heart firmely settled on heauenly things thirdly whereas the holy ghost saith that the hebrewes must cast away the weight that presseth downe here wee are taught in what manner and how farre forth wee must vse the things of this life as riches honours and lawful pleasures yes and all temporall blessings whatsoeuer namely so farre forth as they will further vs in the course of religion and in the exercises of godlinesse and vertue and no further but finding by experience that these temporall things be a burden vnto vs pressing vs downe and making vs vnfit for spirituall exercises we must leaue the and abstaine from them this is that moderation which we must vse in temporall things for the maine ende that euery man must propound to himselfe in all things is this that god may bee glorified now that a man may glorifie god it is necessary that hee should walke in the waies of godlinesse and of true religion therefore looke as riches and worldly commodity may further vs in christian religion and godlinesse so farre forth must wee vse them and therein giue glory to god but when they hinder vs therein then we must leaue them and cast them off the mariner that is vpon the sea in a great tempest seeing his ship too sore laden will cast out any of his commodity first that that is the heauiest and at last if neede bee the most pretious iewels that bee in his ship before he will see it lost euen so must wee doe in the sea of this world when wee see riches honours and lawful pleasures to make vs vnfit amp vntoward for the exercises of pietie and religion then away with them wee must cast them off how deare soeuer they be vnto vs and thus much for the first duty the second duty that we must performe for constancy in religion is this wee must cast away the sinne that hangeth so fast on or as the words will better beare we must cast away the sinne that is so fit or so ready to compasse vs about euery way by sinne here wee must not vnderstand actuall sinne the practicing of vngodlinesse in life and conuersation but originall sinne which is the corruption of nature in which man are conceiued and borne now this originall sinne is said to be ready to compasse vs about because as paul saith of himselfe when a man would doe good it causeth euill to be present with him so as that good thing which he would doe that he doth not but the euill which he would not doe that doth he and it is said to compasse vs about because whatsoeuer in heart a man doth desire or affect or purpose to do this originall sinne doth corrupt and defile the same vnto him and whatsoeuer in action a man would bring to passe it doth likewise pollute it by reason whereof it comes to passe that we may truly say that all the thoghts affections wills and purposes yes and euery action of god children are all mixed and stained with the corruption of this sinne so that this hinders god deare servant and children that they cannot goe on in the course of godlinesse and christianity as they would but either they fall in their iourney many times or if they stand yet they doe often stagger and goe very faintly and haltingly forward from this that the holy ghost saith originall sinne compasseth the beleeuer about we are to obserue and learne sundry points first this serueth notably to confute some errors maintained and vpheld by the church of rome for they say that after a man is regenerate by god spirit there is nothing in him that god can iustly hate and they doe curse all other that holde the contrary now to ratifie this their doctrine that original sinne after regeneration is not sinne properly they say that after regeneration it is no more sinne than tinder is fire which in it selfe is no fire but very apt and fit vpon the least occasion to be set on fire but this opinion is here ouerthrowen by this that the holy ghost saith that the beleeuing hebrewes that is god church must cast away this sinne where it is plain that after regeneration whereby a man receiueth the spirit of sanctification and adoption hee hath sinne in him for this sinne is most apt and ready to hinder him in the course of christianity and godlinesse now if sinne were not properly sinne it must lose it owne nature and quality and if it had lost it proper quality it would not be so ready to hinder a man in the course of godlinesse both in thought wordes and deedes so that here it is manifest and plaine that in a regenerate man there is sinne properly and howsoeuer hee be free from the guilt and punishment of sinne yet the corruption remaineth still in him though greatly weakened through sanctification againe here obserue that the opinion of many man concerning their sanctification is erroneous for some there be who haue thought that a man might be perfectly sanctified in this life and haue originall sinne quite abolished but this is most false for this church of the hebrewes had as worthy man in it for godlinesse and sanctification as any are in these daies yes and the author of this epistle was no doubt a man that had receiued a great measure of sanctifying grace yet including himselfe among them he exhorts the hebrewes thus let vs cast off the burden and sinne that is so ready to compasse vs about what had the apostle amp these christians sinne in them yes or else the holy ghost would neuer bid them cast it off for it were a vaine thing to bid them cast off that which they had not therefore they were not perfectly sanctified as indeede no man euer was or shall be in this life christ onely excepted wee must not maruell at this that no man is perfect in this life nay we must rather maruell at this that god hath giuen to any of vs any droppe of sound grace beeing such miserable wretched sinners as we are the lord himselfe hath giuen many reasons why man should not bee perfect in this life as first if a man were perfectly sanctified in this life then were hee perfectly iust and righteous in himselfe euen before god and so should be saued yet not by free grace and mercy alone in christ and thus should christ not bee a whole and alone sauiour but onely a meanes to conuay into a man that sauing grace whereby a man should be saued but christ is our whole and onely righteousnesse whereby wee are iustified and saued and this may our corruption teach vs which stil remaines in vs not quite mortified till the houre of death secondly whatsoeuer grace we receiue of god it comes by meanes of faith which god worketh in vs and looke how it stands with vs in regard of faith so is it with vs for all other graces but faith in the best beleeuer is imperfect in this life and mixed with much doubting and therefore all other gifts and graces which come by faith as righteousnesse repentance and sanctification are also imperfect in this life from this that sanctification in this life is imperfect we learn for the ouerthrowing of another error of the church of rome that no man can stand at god tribunall seate iustified by inherent iustice or righteousnesse for that which wee call sanctification the papists call the iustification of a sinner making two parts of iustification the first whereby a sinner of an euill man is made good by the pardon of sinnes and the infusion of inward righteousnesse standing in hope and charity especially and the second wherby of a good man one is made better and more iust and this they say may proceede from the merite of a mans owne workes of grace and hereby they hold a man stands righteous before god but looke how it standes with grace in vs in this life so likewise shal it stand with the same graces at the last day if they bee imperfect now and so not able to iustifie vs before god they shall also be found imperfecte then to that purpose and effecte but now they are imperfect as hath beene shewed and therefore cannot then stand for our righteousnesse vnlesse we will imagine that god will then accept of an imperfect iustice wherefore their doctrine is erroneous amp a doctrine of all terrour and desperation for who dare adventure the saluation of his soule vpon his owne righteousnesse wee denie not but that god accepteth of our sanctification yet not as the matter of our iustification vnto life that onely is the obedience and righteousnesse of iesus christ accepted of god for vs and made ours by faith for that alone is aunswerable to the rigour of the law thirdly this also sheweth the errour of those who hold that concupiscence or originall sinne is not a quality but an essence or substance liuing and subsisting by it selfe for here wee see a plaine difference betweene a mans body and soule and originall sinne that compasseth them else the holy ghost would not bid vs to cast off this sinne for that which is of the substance of man cannot by man bee cast off and to make this more plaine we must knowe that in man descending from adam there be three things the substance of his soule and body the powers and faculties in them both the corruption or bad disposition in those powers and faculties whereby a man is vnconformable to the will of his creator and prone to that which is euill and this third thing is it which is here spoken of different from mans substance and faculties and so is not a substance in man or mans nature corrupted but an ill disposition therein fourthly hence also wee learne what a regenerate man doth most feele in himselfe namely originall sinne the corruption of his nature for that hangs on fast and hinders him in the practice of all good duties this paul knew well and therefore confesseth that hee saw another law in his members rebelling against the law of his minde and leading him captiue vnto the law of sinne which was in his members rom this caused him to leaue vndone the good which he would haue done and to do the euill which he would not doe verse and dauid felt the same thing when he saide i will runne the way of thy commaundements when thou shalt enlarge my heart why doth dauid speak of the enlarging of his heart surely he felt in himselfe this originall sinne which did streicten his good affections so as hee could not put them forth so much as hee would toward the law of god and when hee saith psalm stablish me oh lord by thy free spirit he would giue vs to vnderstand that by originall corruption hee was restrained of his christian liberty and hindred in all good affections holy actions and heauenly meditations which causeth him to pray for liberty and freedome by the spirit so that it is plaine the servant of god feeles this corruption clogging and hindering him from all good duties this serues to admonish all secure persons which neuer felt sinne to bee a clogge or burthen vnto them of their fearfull and dangerous estate for to euery childe of god originall corruption is a grieuous burthen now conferre with a natural man and aske him what imperfections and wants he feeles in himselfe his answer is he neuer was hindered by any corruption in all his life he neuer felt doubting or want of loue either to god or to his brother he feeles no pride of heart no guile or hypocrisie nor vaine glory ampc if wee take these man vpon their words they are angels among man but indeede they are blinde and ignorant and wonderfully deceiued by satan for all god servant in this life doe continually bewaile the corruption of their nature crying out against originall sinne that it hinders them in doing the good things which they would doe and causing them to doe that euill which they would not these man therefore that are neuer troubled with corruption but to their owne thinking haue grace at will are in a fearefull case their mindes are still blinded and their hearts hardned they are dead in sin abiding in darknesse vnto this houre and if they goe thus on to death they shall finde that sinne will vnvizor himselfe and then they shall knowe what sinne meanes and finde the terrour and feele the burthen of it when it is too late like the foolish virgines that knew what the want of oyle meant when the doores were shut secondly this shewes vnto vs what is the state and condition of the childe of god in this life he is not heere a saint feeling no corruption perfectly sanctified amp freed from all sinne but such a one as feeles the burthen of corruption hindering him in his christian course vnder which hee sighes and groanes labouring by all good meanes to bee disburthened and to cast it off it is indeede a matter of great comfort for a man to feele god graces in himselfe as faith loue repentance sanctification and such like but no childe of god can alwayes or alone feele the comfort of grace most commonly hee shall be troubled with sinne if he be god childe now if feeling it hee dislike himselfe and striue to bee eased of it this is a sure argument of his happy estate fiftly this commaundement to cast away sinne that presseth downe teacheth euery childe of god to labour earnestly for the gouernment and direction of god spirit for wee haue within vs originall corruption that like an armed man besets vs about and hindereth vs in euerie good thing wee take in hand wee must therefore pray vnto god daily that hee would guide vs by his good spirit for by reason of the corruption of our nature and the deceitfulnesse of sinne wee shall vtterly faile vnlesse god spirit gouerne vs both in the thoughts of our hearts in the words of our mouthes and the actions of our liues this dauid knew well and therefore prayeth to the lord for his good spirit to leade him into the land of righteousnesse psalm lastly seeing wee haue this corruption of nature in vs wee must keepe our hearts with all diligence and set watch and ward about them so salomon saith counterguard thy heart my son prouerbs why doth salomon giue this commandement surely for special cause for euery man while he liues on earth is compassed about with his owne corrupt nature which like a home borne traytor seekes to deliuer the heart into the possession of satan and so to defraud god of his right againe the heart is mans treasury from whence come all actions good and badde now if it bee well kept and guarded the lord will dwell in thy heart and thence will proceede the issues of life but if it bee left open for corruption to enter and take place then is it made an habitation for the diuell if a citie were besieged about by bloody enemy the inhabitant thereof would set watch and ward in euery place to keepe out the enemie so wee hauing originall sinne as a fierce enemie compassing vs about for to work our destruction some way or other must labour to haue our hearts guarded with a watch of grace that our corruption may not let in satan there to dwell or to haue any abode but will some say how shall we get a watch that may thus keepe our hearts answer wee must labour that the word of god may dwell plentifully in our hearts and there as the scepter of christ to be held vp by the grace of faith ruling our wills and affections amp bringing into subiection euery thoght to the obedience of christ in such a heart christ dwells who is stronger than satan and here can neither corruption set open the doore to satan nor satan enter but all things are in safetie also the actions that proceede hence shall be the issues of life beeing holy and pleasing vnto god and thus much of the second point the third duty to bee performed for our continuance in the faith is this wee must runne with patience the race that is set before vs in these words the holy ghost borroweth a comparison from the games of man that did runne a race and thus we may conceiue it the race that the holy ghost propounds vs to runne is the race of christian religion the parties that must runne in this race are all christians man or woman high or lowe not one excepted the price and crowne for which we runne is euerlasting glory the iudge of the runners is the lord himselfe who hath appointed this race vnto euery christian in this life who also will giue the reward to euery one that runneth well in this comparison wee may obserue many good instructions first in that christian religion is compared to a race we are taught that euery one that professeth religion must goe forward therein growing in knowledge faith piety and in euery grace of god he that runnes a bodily race must neither stand still nor goe backward for then then he shall neuer get the price but still goe forward to the race ende so must euery christian goe forward in grace following hard towards the marke for the price of the high calling of god if wee care not for eternall life then we may take our ease and let grace alone but if wee tender our owne saluation wee must goe on in the graces of religion as a runner doth goe forward in his race this beeing wel obserued would rowze vp our drowzie christians that make no progresse in religion secondly this resemblance of christianity to a race teacheth vs al to striue to go one before another in knowledge faith and holy obedience thus runners doe that run a bodily race also in the world the manner of man is to labour and striue to goe one before another in riches preferment in fine apparell and in all bodily delights now shall man striue to bee first in these transitory things and shall wee neglect our duty about these spirituall graces wherein the more we excell the more acceptable wee are to god and shall bee more glorious in the world to come thirdly seeing christianity is a race wee must remember to be constant therein till we come to the ende of our faith euen the saluation of our soules it hath beene the manner of our people to turne in religion with the state and time and yet to this day many thousands come to our assemblies that would turne to popery if that abhomination should be set vp againe for say they it was a merry world when that religion was vp but this is not the property of good runners if wee would haue the crowne of life we must hold true religion constantly vnto the death lastly like good runners we must minde our way and haue our hearts set vpon the ende of our race which is euerlasting life each ordinary traueller is very inquisitiue of his way and all his care is to goe the neerest way he can to his iourneys ende behold wee are trauellers and our iourney is to heauen we must therefore endeauour to goe the straightest way we can to come to life euerlasting neither must we make delaies in this way but vse all helpes to further vs herein for the matter is of great importance whereabout we goe here some will say we like this well but true religion hath alwaies many enemy and fewe hearty friends besides if a man run this way hee must runne alone and suffer also many crosses and reproaches answer this is most true and therefore the holy ghost addeth that wee must runne this race with patience we must not be discouraged because of these crosses and afflictios but labour with patience to beare that part of affliction what euer it bee that shall light vpon vs in our iourney this is christs counsell to his disciples luke possesse your soules in patience as if hee should say if you would saue your soules you must labour to beare all crosses that fall on you with patience in the parable luke they that receiue the seed in good ground are they which with an honest and good heart heare the word and keepe it and bring forth fruite but how with patience euery one that heares god word amp makes conscience thereof shall haue enemy to scoffe and mock and to afflict him which the diuell sets a worke to hinder the growth of the word in his heart but must he therefore cease to bring forth fruite no hee must bring forth fruite with patience and so must we doe in the race of true religion for crosses afflictions and mockings will come but these stormes must not turne vs backe nay the more they beate vpon vs the more must we arme our selues with patience by which wee shall be able to beare them all and thus much for this third duty as also of the exhortation vnto constancie in the faith after the example of all these godly fathers

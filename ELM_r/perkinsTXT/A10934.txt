every one that will be saued must first know and be perswaded in heart of his miserable estate lay de foorth in these eight poynts following amp be truly humbled thereby that we were created happy in the loynes of adam which happinesse he lost by his fall and we through him and so are brought to vtter miserie that this our miserie consisteth first in our guiltinesse by adams transgression amp our owne both originall amp actuall sinnes and secondly in the desert and punishment thereof which is death temporall of the body amp eternall both of body amp soule with all the calamities that appertaine to them both that our sinfulnesse is such as it continually defileth all our actions our thoughts wordes and deedes and that the punishment which is god curse is such as lieth vpon vs alwayes and in all places so that we are nothing but a lumpe of sinne and vnder the wrath of god continually that no man is able to satisfie for his sinne to appease god wrath and to come out of this miserie by any thing that he can doe or that may be done by any other man for him and that none is able to beare and ouercome the intollerable waight of that curse of god which hangeth ouer him for his sinne that they which know not this still goe forwards in it without trouble of minde thinking their case good enough they that onely know it being full of poyson and rebellion for the most part rage against the doctrine thereof amp become more greedy to goe on in all euill when they see their sinne forbidden or at least they abide still in it but if any be pricked in conscience and humbled by this he maketh a right and profitable vse of it as shall be seene in the sixt poynt that seeing it is thus with man they who haue not mourned and yet see they haue cause must sorrow and weepe turning their laughter into wayling and their ioy into heauinesse till they see themselues deliuered from this woe for they are not to be ignorant that there is hope that to attaine this mourning which is hardly wrought in vs these meanes and such like are to be vsed that we harden not our heartes in hearing the law but suffer it to worke vpon vs to be willing to examine our heartes and liues for the finding out of some speciall sinnes and when wee see them wee do not lightly passe them ouer and confesse them but aggrauate them to humble vs that wee consider the greatnesse of the punishment with the eternitie thereof an holy despaire of any remedie from our selues or any other creature a perswading of our selues that many are damned for those sinnes which we liue in that wee weigh and consider our mortalitie in this life amp the vncertaintie of our death and finally vse all the afflictions which god layeth vpon vs vnto this end that this mourning amp sorrowing for sinne and the woe it hath brought vpon vs cannot appease god wrath towards vs but is required of all vnbeleeuers to breake their hearts and cause them to lament after god not to iustifie them before god but to make them fit to receiue the ghospell and prepare them to heare his voyce that sayth come vnto mee all yee that trauell and are laden and i will giue you rest for although man can not make account of the remedie except they feele their need and miserie yet if any rest in this sorrow and seeke not the remedie following in the next part he shall neuer be happie for it shall either vanish and be forgotten in time leauing no fruite behinde or driue them to vtter despayring hee must know and be persvaded that he is as fully and clearely restored vnto happinesse as he was deeply plunged into miserie which is declared in the eight poyntes following that god hath prouided a remedie against all this miserie by which we may be set free from it this remedie is perfect satisfaction and perfect righteousnesse whereby onely wee may be freed from death and restored vnto life so as god iustice may be fully answered all our sinnes forgiuen and wee adopted vnto euerlasting life that this remedie is not to be found but onely in christ iesus who being both god and man hath in our nature suffered the punishment due vnto our sinnes to deliuer vs from the same and fulfilled the righteousnesse of the law to iustifie vs before god and so deliuering vs from sinne and death hath restored vs to righteousnes and life being made vnto vs from god his father wisedome righteousnesse sanctification and redemption that whosoeuer glorieth may glory in the lord that the onely meanes to receiue christ and in him saluation is fayth in the person mentioned in the former part of this direction seeing christ hath plainely affirmed that he is a phisition to such sicke ones and calleth them to receiue that is to beleeue it which fayth is a woonderfull and supernaturall grace of god whereby we receiue christ amp all his benefites and is ordinarily wrought in mens heartes by the outward preaching of the word and the inward operation of the holy ghost therefore such as seeke this must heare sermons often amp diligently they must be much mooued amp drawne by the reports of other godly as andrew by peter and nathaniel by philip and they must be encouraged to beleeue by the example of others who were as farre off as they they must vse good company as paul when he was cast downe sought to ioyne himselfe to the apostles and reuerence god graces in the ministers and in his people by these meanes many haue been added to the church and beleeued that by this glad tidinges preached in his name and the other meanes god draweth the hearts of such as shall enioy it after they know that there is a remedy to hunger after it and desire it aboue all other thinges not fleetingly nor houertly but feruently and constantly so as nothing can satisfie them without it amp to prize it aboue all other things which grace being a peculiar gift of the spirit is not without fayth in some measure and though it be not in full assurance by and by yet so as they neuer cease till they can apply it to themselues which shall be when they haue felt the sweetnesse of christ when they see they take the yoke vpon them and be willingly subiect to his word and commaundement then they shall finde rest vnto their soules that we therefore feeling what great need wee haue of it as hauing been pricked in our hearts for our sinne and damnable estate and beene broken hearted and hauing this feruent desire after it amp so highly esteeming it as nothing more may apply it to our selues and doe rest perswaded for all our vnworthinesse that it is ours amp freely bequeathed to vs of god because christ is giuen of god and hath giuen himselfe for such and for our better encouragement hereunto wee are to know that christ commaundeth exhorteth and beseecheth vs to beleeue in himselfe so that wee neede not feare that it is presumption thus to doe and seeing we are so fearefull at our first calling that we dare not thinke we haue fayth know that these are sure tokens of it if we striue against doubting if we not feeling it complaine bitterly of the want of it if we seeke feruently to be setled in beleeuing if we desire to search out the sinne which may possibly hinder vs to expell it and some one of these or other graces like them shall euer be seene in the beleeuer by such as can iudge though not alwayes perceiued of the partie himselfe euen as by moouing breathing feeling ampc it is gathered that life is in the body which lyeth for dead that by all good meanes we confirme this fayth in vs dayly the meanes are partly those which are set downe in the third poynt of the third part and namely the examples of others who of weake became strong the often and due considering of god loue that it is vnchangeable and our owne experience who beleeuing the promise when wee thought it impossible may much more now be perswaded of it and of the fauour of god especially seeking it penitently as we did then but if we grow not we began but counterfaitly that if our fayth be confirmed and we perswaded of our saluation and god fauour it will appeare in vs by these signes which may be called inseparable companions to it first that we haue peace with god and reioyce for it sensibly secondly that we loue the lord most dearely and god people heartily thirdly that wee haue our heartes enlarged to prayse god secretly and openly for so great kindnesse as to preferre vs before so many thousandes fourthly to woonder at it in giuing thankes fiftly if we pittie comfort and strengthen others sixtly if we long to goe hence where we are absent from the lord and seuenthly desire to goe home to him and lastly if we mourne for our vnkindnesse past towardes god who was so kind to vs euen while we wandred from him hee must vnderstand and practise to the end of his life that maner of conuersation which god hath appoynted and commaunded euery faythfull christian to walke in after he hath once beleeued as it is shewed in the eight poynts following that he that is saued by christ is also by him mortified vnto sinne and regenerate vnto righteousnesse amp true holinesse and finally is become a new creature and being now by fayth in christ made the childe of god doth withall receiue of god a mind to know him an heart to loue him a will to please him and in some measure also strength and power to obey him and although with imperfection yet with manifest difference from his former estate and contrarily he doth hate sin as he loueth goodnesse that the beleeuer being thus sanctified and changed must giue all diligence to keepe his heart in that estate afterward amp endeauour to practise the godly life in his particular actions that is deny all vngodlynesse in his behauiour and worldly lustes in his heart and contrarily liue soberly himselfe in moderating his affections in all lawful lyberties righteously towardes man in giuing euery one their due and holily towards god in worshipping and seruing him onely in which thinges standeth our true repentance that vnto euery one that hath fayth and is truly though in weakenesse reformed god giueth willingnesse readinesse and desire to vse the meanes which he hath ordained for the keeping and confirming of himselfe in this christian course vnto which are necessarie these two thinges a certaine direction and order of proceeding in this estate by obseruing our selues that in one thing as well as another wee keepe a good conscience or if wee be ouertaken and step out of the way yet that wee lie not still but returne and that armour of a christian set downe the chiefe partes whereof are these sixe sinceritie righteousnesse fayth hope preparation for afflictions and knowledge of god word to descerne the deceitfulnesse of sinne for the keeping of these wee must pray often and earnestly with watching adding thereunto hearing of the word preached and the vse of the sacramentes reading meditation conference good example of others god benefites and chastisements dayly meditated of and rightly vsed and our owne experience that out of all that hath been before set downe and namely in these three former poyntes wee gather out a direction to guide our selues euery day vnto our end a summe whereof is this first that euery day as wee search and finde out our sinnes we heartily dislike and renounce them amp repent secondly that euery day we be raysed vp in assured hope of the pardon of them by the promise of god in christ thirdly that euery day we keepe our heartes in frame weaned from carnall libertie and fitte to any duetie fourthly that euery day we be strongly armed against any knowne sinne fiftly that euery day we endeauour to do any duety commaunded sixtly that euery day we pray for all necessaries and namely that wee watch and pray to be strengthned against sinne and steadfast in our christian course seuenthly that euery day our thankes for benefites already receiued and other still certainely hoped for be continued eightly that euery day we hold fast and keepe peace with god and so lie downe in it these are not so enioyned euery day as though it were enough barely to thinke of them euery day but that we be accompanied with the most of them through the day and strengthned with the rest i meane prayer and thanksegiuing so that by the helpe of them all wee may be made able to passe the day both in company amp solitarinesse at home and abroad in afflictions and prosperitie and in all our actions of the day to honour god therein according to that which is written whether we eate or drinke ampc that wee be watchfull to withstand and auoyd all the lets which may hinder this course as want of the meanes and namely the helpe of the word preached slouthfulnesse carelesnesse in obseruing our wayes a yeelding to temptation commonnesse and boldnesse in sinne and a thinking that we are well enough already wearinesse in doing good vntowardnes custome in sinne amp long lying in it the vsing of ill company worldlinesse prophanenesse of heart loosenesse of the eye eare tongue ampc that the lord hath commaunded and doth promise to performe that euery one of his faythfull seruantes shall perseuere in this course by that power he giueth them by fayth this perswasion is no small encouragement vnto continuance and constancie in hope patience and well doing that least we deceiue our selues we be able to proue amp doe often indeed proue as we shall see cause that our repentance is sound which may appeare to vs by these notes first if our heartes be changed secondly if we auoyde one sinne as well as another thirdly if we keepe our hearts with all diligence hauing so often found them false and deceitfull so that good life may come fro thence fourthly if we labour to please god according to his word as well in well doing as in the deedes themselues fiftly if wee still goe forward in this course without fainting or discouragement as our knowledge increaseth and if we fall asleepe amp offende against our knowledge that we complaine of our corruption and be not quiet vntill by relenting for our sinne and earnest suing to god he returne to vs againe and receiue vs which he will doe and then be more carefull afterwards against the least occasions that this course bringeth sound wisedome experience and comfort and teacheth vs how to carry our selues in all estates amp conditions of life whether of trouble or peace and to answere all the ca els and quarrels of the diuell and his instruments it bringeth vs into most inward acquaintance and communion with god and christ maketh vs ready to die fit to liue and to finde greater gaine in both then in any other estate and in one word happy heere and happy euer whereas without it the beautie and benefite of the christian life is smally or not at all enioyed nor after the kingdome of glory possessed i haue set before thee gentle reader a frame of a christian course in these three partes now when in knowledge liuing and going about the practise hereof it is entred vpon amp thus farre raysed vp yet it is but an house vntiled amp vndawbed without windowes doores implements and other furniture and therefore not so to be left some neuer doe so much as enter vpon it some beginning doe not finish it and yet the first sort may be long beating about it the last are grosely deceiued to let it stand vnperfected amp therefore neuer reape the benefite of it such are they who hauing begun in all these three partes leaue off as though they had done all but the true christian hauing laide for himselfe this good foundation buildeth therevpon proportionably as the apostle sayth and so reapeth a sure amp constant fruite of his labour notwithstanding all the troubles and dangers that may assayle him and if thou go about to be directed by this take heed it waxe not loathsome to thee in time and so vsed for fashion and not to gouerne thee for then thou loosest the benefite of it as one that eateth meate with a full stomacke and not for hunger and it shall loose her beautie with thee and yet through slouth negligence and loue of this world with the pleasures of it and manifold discouragements this will come to passe in the morning awake with god and before all other thinges offer vp vnto him thy morning sacrifice of prayer therein remembering first to giue heartie thankes vnto him for all his mercies bodily and spirituall and namely for thy late preseruation secondly make an humble confession of thy sinnes with earnest desire of pardon thirdly aske such necessaries as are requisite for thy soule and body with feruent request to be relieued in them and namely desire his blessing vpon thy labours in thy calling in the day to come in what place soeuer thou article let this perswasion abide in thine heart that thou article before the liuing god and let the remembrance hereof strike thine heart with awe amp reuerence and make thee afrayde to sinne make conscience of idle vaine vnhonest amp vngodly thoughts for these are the seedes and beginnings of actuall sinne in word and deede haue speciall care to auoyde those sinnes which thou findest thy nature most prone vnto and eschew those prouocations which were woont most to preuaile against thee follow with faythfulnesse and diligence thy lawful particular calling in which thou article placed thinke euer more thy present estate and condition to be the best estate for thee what soeuer it be because it is of the good prouidence of god looke well to thy carriage in company that thou do no hurt by word or example nor take any from others but endeauour rather to doe good vse ciuill honestie towardes all man good conscience and good manners must goe togeather if at any time against thy purpose thou be ouertaken with any sinne lie not in it but speedily recouer thy selfe by repentance when any good m tion or affection doth arise in thine heart suffer it not to passe away but feed it by reading meditating or praying esteeme of euery present day as of the day of thy death and therefore liue now euen as though thou were now dying and doe those good duties euerie day which thou wouldest doe if this were thy dying day at the end of the day before thou lie downe in thy bedde call to minde how thou hast spent the day that is passed thy misdoinges repent and prayse god for assisting thee with his grace in the dueties which thou hast performed sleepe not at night before thou hast commended thy selfe by prayer into the handes of god for thou knowest not whether falne asleepe thou shalt rise againe aliue let prayer be the key to open the morning and the barre to shut in the euening as the iust liue by fayth so the iust liue the life of fayth now they liue the life of grace one day they shall liue the life of glory thinke that the greatest worke thou hast to finish in this world is to die well and to make an happie departure out of this world they which die well die not to die but to liue eternally be euery day readie to leaue this life that man doth finish his dayes in best sort that euery day esteemeth the last day of his life to be present amp at hand endeauour before death come vpon thee to pull out this sting amp take from him his power amp strenght by humbling thy selfe in the time present for all thy sinnes past amp by turning thy selfe vnto god for the time to come that man can neuer die ill that hath a care to liuewel inure thy selfe by litle amp litle to die before thou come to that poynt that thou must needes die he that leaues the world before the world leaues him giues death the hand like a welcome messenger and departs in peace chiefly when thou article visited with sicknesse or old age thinke either of these a summoner warning thee ere long to appeare before the great lord iudge of all the world therefore now prepare to set all things in good order and make thine accountes ready make a new examination of thy life and conuersation passed make a new confession vnto god of thy new and particular sinnes as god sendes new corrections and chastisementes make new prayers and more earnest then euer before for pardon of thy sinnes amp reconciliation with god in christ by all meanes auoyde those sinnes which thou findest and feelest to incense the wrath of god against thee seek reconciliation with thy neighbour by free forgiuenesse of them that haue offended thee and earnestly desire to be forgiuen of all that haue been offended by thee set thine house and familie in order by disposing of thy worldly goodes in thy will and testament thereby shalt thou die not the more quickly but the more quietly and preuent the brawles and iarres that otherwise when thou article gone may arise among thine heires thou partest from earthly possessions and article going to take possession of heauenly in the last agonie of death when all things in and of the world doe fayle and forsake thee rest thy selfe by fayth on the fauour and mercie of god in christ and comfort thy selfe in the lord thy god what shall separate from the loue of god in christ nor life nor death let thine heart and tongue be still imployed in prayer to the lord first for patience in thy trouble second for comfort in thine affliction third for strength in his mercy fourth for deliuerance at his pleasure yes endeauour euen to die praying when thou article in the deapth of miseries and at the gates of death there is a deapth of god mercy which is ready to heare amp helpe thee miserie must call vpon mercie be willing and ready to depart out of this world without murmuring or repining whesoeuer wheresoeuer or howsoeuer it shall please the lord to call thee for why shouldest thou vnwillingly suffer a short death that will bring thee to the fruition of eternall ioyes perswade thy selfe that if thou liue by the mercie of god thou shalt do well but if thou die doubt not but thou shalt doe better and with a free heart speake it come lord iesu lastly when thou feelest death approaching commende thy departing soule into the holy hands of god hee gaue it to him surrender it againe so laying thy selfe downe to sleepe amp rest god shall make thee dwell in euerlasting safetie a good life till death and a good death after a good life are the best meanes to attaine an eternall happie life in heaue as death leaueth thee so shall iudgement find thee christ is to mee both in life and death aduantage often meditate of god amp good things carefully watch ouer thine outwarde senses chiefly thine eyes and thine eares be alwayes doing something that is good forethinke whether it be lawful and fit to be spoken auoyde all superfluitie of wordes and needlesse speaches affirme no more then thou knowest to be true doe all things as in god sight eschew the company of those that are ill disposed thinke dayly of thy death and that last great account good sir i know the lord hath giuen you the tongue of the learned to be able to minister a word in time to him that is wearie therfore i pray you helpe me in my miserie ah my good brother what is the matter with you and what would you i liued a long time the lord he knoweth it after the manner of the world in all the lustes of my filthy flesh and then i was neuer troubled but it hath pleased god of his infinite mercie to touch my heart and to send his owne son that good shepheard iesus christ to fetch me home to his owne fold euen vpon his owne necke and since that time it is a woonder to see how my poore heart hath bin troubled my corruption so boyles in mee and sathan will neuer let me alone your case is a blessed case for not to be troubled of sathan is to be possessed of him that is to be helde captiue vnder the power of darkenesse and to be a slaue and vassall of sathan for as long as the strong man keepes the hold all thinges are in peace contrariwise he that hath receiued any true sparkle of fayth shall see the gates of hell that is the deuill and all his angels in their full strength to stand vp against him amp to fight with an endlesse hatred for his finall confusion but this is my trouble of minde hath made me oftentimes feare least god would reiect me and vtterly depriue me of the kingdome of heauen but there is no cause why it should so doe for why or how should heauen bee your resting place if on earth you were not troubled how could god wipe away your teares from heauen if on earth you shedde them not you would be free from miseries you looke for heauen vpon earth but if you will go to heauen the right way is to saile by hell if you will sit at christes table in his kingdome you must be with him in his temptations you are as god corne you must goe vnder the flaile the fan the milstone and the ouen before you can be god bread you are one of christes lambes looke therefore to be fleeced and to haue the bloody knife at your throate all the day long if you were a market sheepe brought to be sold you should be stalled and kept in a fatte pasture but you are for god owne occupying therefore you must pasture on the bare common abiding stormes tempestes sathans snatches the worlds woundes contempt of conscience and frettes of the flesh but in this your miserie i will be a simon vnto you to helpe you to carry your crosse so be it you will reueale your minde vnto mee i will doe it willingly my temptations are either against my fayth in christ or against repentance for my sinnes what is your temptation as touching fayth oh woe is mee i am much afrayde least i haue no fayth in christ my sauiour what causeth this feare diverse thinges what is one i am troubled with many doubtinges of my saluation amp so it comes into my minde to thinke that by my incredulitie i should quite cut off my selfe from the fauour of god but you must know this one thing that hee that neuer doubted of his saluation neuer beleeued and that hee which beleeueth in truth feeleth many doubtinges and wauerings euen as the sound man feeles many grudginges of diseases which if that hee had not health he could not feele but you neuer knew any that hauing true fayth doubted of their saluation what will you then say of the man that sayd lord i beleeue lord helpe my vnbeliefe and of dauid who made his moane after this manner is his mercie cleane gone for euer doth his promise fayle for euermore hath god forgotten to be mercifull hath he shut vp his tender mercie in displeasure yes he goeth on further as a man in dispaire and i said this is my death hereby it is manifest that a man indued with true fayth may haue not only assaults of doubting but of desperation this further appeareth in that he saith in an other place why article thou cast downe my soule why article thou disquieted in me waite on god for i will yet giue thanks he is my present helpe and my god and in very trueth you may perswade your selfe that they are but vnreasonable man that say they haue long beleeued in christ without any doubting at all of their saluation but dauid hath more in him then i haue for mee thinkes there is nothing in this wicked heart of mine but rebellion against god nothing but doubting of his mercie let me know but one thing of you these doubtinges which you feele doe you like them or do you take any pleasure in them and do you cherish them nay nay they appeare very vile in mine eyes and i doe abhorre them from my heart and i would faine beleeue in man you must consider his estate by n ure amp his estate by grace in the first he and his flesh are all one for they are as man and wife therfore one is accessarie to the doinges of the other when the flesh sinneth the man also sinneth that is in subiection to the flesh yes when the flesh perisheth the man likewise perisheth being in this estate with the flesh a louing couple they liue and die togeather but in the estate of grace though a man haue the flesh in him yet he and his flesh are diuorced a sunder this diuorcement is made when a man begins to dislike and hate his flesh and the euill fruites of it this separation being made they are no more one but twaine and the one hath nothing to do with the other in this case though the flesh begette sinne amp perish therefore yet the christian man shall not endure damnation for it to come more neare the matter you say the flesh begets in you wauerings doubtinges and distrustinges what then it troubleth you but feare not remember your estate you are diuorced from the flesh and you are new married with christ if these sinnes be layd at your doore account them not as your children but renounce them as bastardes say with paul i doubt indeed but i hate my doubtinges and i am no cause of these but the flesh in mee which shall perish when i shall be saued by christ this which you haue said doth in part content mee one thing more i pray you shew mee concerning this poynt namely how i may be able to ouercome these doubtinges for the suppressing of doubtinges you are to vse three meditations the first that is god commaundement that you should beleeue in christ so s john sayth this is his commaundement that we beleeue in the name of his son iesus christ thou shalt not steale is god commandement amp you are loath to breake it least you should displease god and pull his cursse vpon your head this also is god commandement thou shalt beleeue in christ and therefore you must take heed of the breach of it least by doubting amp wauering you bring the cursse vpon you secondly you must consider that the promises of saluation in christ are generall or at the least indiffinite excluding no particular man as in one for al may appeare god so loued the world that he gaue his onely begotten son that whosoeuer beleeueth in him shoud not perish but haue euerlasting life now then so often as you shal doubt of god mercie you exclude your owne selfe from the promise of god whereas he excludeth you not and as when a prince giues a pardon to all theeues euery one can apply the same vnto himselfe though his name be not set downe in the pardon so the king of kings hath giuen a generall pardon for free remission of sinnes to them that will receiue it beleeue therefore that god is true in his promise doubt not of your owne saluation challenge the pardon to your selfe indeed your name is not set downe or written in the promise of grace yet let not any illusion of sathan or the consideration of your owne vnworthinesse exclude you from this free mercie of god which he hath also offered to you particularly first in baptisme then after in the lordes supper and therefore you are not to wauer in the applying of it to your selfe thirdly you are to consider that by doubting and despayring you offende god as much almost as by any other sinne you do not aboue hope beleeue vnder hope as you should do secondly you robbe god of his glorie in that you make his infinite mercie to be lesse then your sinnes thirdly you make him a lyer who hath made such a promise vnto you and to these three meditations adde this practise when your heart is toyled with vnbeliefe and doubtings then in all haste draw your selfe into some secret place humble your selfe before god poure out your heart before him desire him of his endlesse mercie to worke faith and to suppresse your vnbeliefe and you shal see that the lord ouer all is ritch vnto all that call vpon his name the lord reward you for your kindnesse i will hereafter doe my indeauour to practise this your counsell now i wil make bold to shew an other that makes me to feare least i haue no fayth and it is because i doe not feele the assurance of the forgiuenesse of my sinnes fayth standeth not in the feeling of god mercie but in the apprehending of it which apprehending may be when there is no f eling for faith is of inuisible things and when a man once commeth to enioy the thing beleeued then he seaseth to beleeue and this appeareth in jobs example when he sayeth loe though hee slay mee yet will i trust in him and i will reproue my wayes in his sight he shall be my saluation also for the hipocrite shall not come before him hee declareth his fayth yet when he sayth presently afterward wherefore hidest thou thy face and takest mee for thine enimie hee declareth the want of that feeling which you speake of yet euery true beleeuer feeles the assuraunce of fayth otherwise paul would not haue said proue your selues whether you be in the fayth or not indeed sometimes he doth but at some other times he doth not as namely at that same time when god first calleth him and in the time of temptation what a case am i in then i neuer felt this assurance onely this i feele that i am a most rebellious wretch abounding with a whole sea of iniquities mee thinkes i am more vgly in the sight of god then any toad can be in my sight o then what shall i doe let mee heare some comfort from thy mouth thou man of god tell mee one thing plainely you say you feele no assurance of god mercie no indeed but doe you desire with all your heart to feele it i doe indeed then doubt not you shal feele it o blessed be the lord if this be true why it is most true for the man that would haue any grace of god tending to saluation if he doe truely desire it he shall haue it for so christ hath promised i will giue to him that is a thirst of the well of the water of life freely whereby i gather that if any want the water of life hauing any appetite after it he shall haue enough of it and therefore feare you not onely vse the meanes which god hath appoynted to attaine faith by as earnest prayer reuerent hearing of god word and receiuing of the sacramentes and then you shall see these thinges verified in your selfe all this which you say i finde in my selfe by the mercy of god my heart longeth after that grace of god which i want i know i doe hunger after the kingdome of heauen and the righteousnesse thereof and further though i want the feeling of god mercie yet i can pray for it from the verie roote of my heart be carefull to giue honour to god for that you haue receiued alreadie for these thinges are the motions of the spirit of god dwelling in you and i am perswaded of this same thing that god which hath begun this good worke in you will perfect the same vnto the day of iesus christ the third thing that troubles me is this i haue long prayed for manie graces of god and yet i haue not receiued them whereby it comes oft to my minde that god loues mee not that i am none of his child and therefore that i haue no fayth you are in no other case then dauid himselfe was who made the same complaint i am wearie of crying my throate is dry mine eyes faile whiles i waite for my god but dauid neuer prayed so many yeares without receiuing an answere as i haue done good zachary waighted longer on the lord before he graunted his request then euer you did it is like he prayed for a child in his younger yeares yet his prayer was not heard before he was olde and further you must note that the lord may heare the prayers of his seruantes and yet they be altogeather ignoraunt of them for the manner that god vseth in graunting their request is not alwayes knowen as may appeare in the example of our sauiour christ who in the dayes of his flesh did offer vp prayers and supplications with strong crying and teares vnto him that was able to saue him from death amp was also heard in that which he feared and yet wee know that he was not freed from that cursed death but must needes suffer it how then was he heard on this manner hee was strengthned to beare the death hee had an angell to comfort him hee was afterward freed from the sorrow of death and so it is with the rest of christes bodie as it was with the head some being in want pray for temporall blessinges god keepes them in this want and yet he heares their prayers in giuing them patience and strength to abide that want some being in wealth and aboundance pray for the continuing of it if it be the will of god the lord linges them into a perpetuall miserie and yet he heares their prayers by giuing them blessednesse in the life to come you pray for the increase of fayth and repentance and such like graces you feele no increase after long prayer yet the mercifull god hath no doubt heard your praier in that by delaying to performe your request he hath stirred vp in you the spirit of prayer he hath humbled you and made you feele your owne wantes the better to depende on his mercie for the beginning amp increasing of euery particular grace the fourth thing that troubles me is that i can not feele fayth purifie my heart amp to worke by loue in bringing foorth liuely fruites if this be so continually that fayth bringes foorth no fruite it is verie dangerous amp argueth a plaine want of fayth yet for a certaine time it may be so fayth hath not onely a spring time and a summer season but also a winter when it beareth no fruite and there is many a true christian like the brused reed that is ouerturned with euery blast of wind and like the flaxe that hath fire in it which by reason of weakenesse giues no heate nor light but onely a smoake thus much shall suffice for my first temptation wherein i take my selfe satisfied now if you please i will be glad to rehearse the second i am content let vs heare it i am afrayd least i haue not truly repented and therefore that all my profession is onely in hipocrisie what mooueth you to thinke so two causes especially the first is they which repent leaue off to sinne but i am a miserable sinner i do continually displease god by my euill thoughts wordes and deedes you need not feare for where sinne aboundeth that is the knowledge and feeling of sinne there grace aboundeth much more i finde not this in my selfe but yet you finde thus much in your selfe those corruptions which you feele and those sinnes which you commit you hate them you are displeased with your selfe for them and you endeauour your selfe to leaue them yes that i do with all my heart then how miserable soeuer you feele your selfe by reason of the masse of your sinne yet you are not subiect to condemnatio but shall most certainely escape the same take this for a most certaine trueth that the man that hates and dislikes his sinnes both before amp after he hath done them shall neuer be damned for it i am euen heart sicke of my manifold sinnes and infirmities and those good wordes which you speake are as flagons of wine to refresh my wearie laden amp wealtring soule i haue begun to leaue sinne and wickednesse and to detest it long agoe i haue been oft displeased with mine infirmities and corruptions when i offend god my heart is grieued i desire to leaue sinne i flie the occasions of sinne i would faine fashion my life to god word and i pray vnto god that he would giue mee grace so to doe and yet which is my griefe by the strength of the flesh by the sleight and power of sathan i am verie often ouertaken and fall marueylously both by speach and by deed haue courage my good brother for whereas you haue an affection to doe the thinges that are acceptable vnto god it argueth plainely that you are a member of christ according to that of pau they which are of the spirit sauour the thinges of the spirit well then if sathan euer obiect any of your sinnes to you make answere thus that you haue forsaken the first husband the flesh and haue espoused your selfe to chri iesus who as your head amp husband hath taken vpon him to answere your debtes and therefore if he vrge you for them referre them ouer vnto christ for there is no sute in law against the wife the husband liuing yes i adde further if you be ouercarried with sathans temptation and to fall into any sinne you shall not answere for it but sathan it shall surely be reckoned on his score at the day of iudgement for he was the author of it if you fall by the frayltie of your flesh it shall perish therefore but you shall still haue christ your aduocate indeed as you say i haue in mee an aflection to please god but when i come to performe my obedience there i fayle therefore marke this further as long as the children of god are in this life god regardeth more the affection to obey then the obeydience it selfe and they shall be vnto mee sayth the lord of hoastes in that day i will doe this for a flocke and i will spare them as a man spareth his owne son that serueth him the father when he shall set his child to doe any businesse though he doe it neuer so vntowardly yet if he shew his good will to doe the best he can his father will be pleased and so is it with the lord toward his children you looke to haue some perfection in your selfe but in this life you shall receiue no more but the first fruites of the spirit which are but as a handfull of corne in respect of the whole corne field and as for the accomplishment of your redemption you must waite for it after this life you would be kissed with the kisses of christes mouth but here in this world you must be content if you may with mary magdaline kisse his feete for the perfection of a christian mans life standes in the feeling and confession of his imperfections and as ambro e saith that the obedience due vnto god standes more in the affection then in the worke but why will god haue those whom he hath sanctified labour still vnder their infirmities the causes are diverse first hereby he teacheth his seruantes to see in what great need they stande of the righteousnesse of christ that they may more carefully seeke after it secondly he subdueth the pride of mens heartes and humbleth them by counteruayling the graces which they haue receiued with the like measure of infirmities thirdly by this meanes the godly are exercised in a continuall fight against sinne and are daily occupied in purifiing themselues but to goe on forward in this matter there is an other cause that makes mee feare least i haue no true repentance what is that i often times find my selfe like a very timber log voyde of all grace and goodnesse froward and rebellious to any good worke so that i feare least christ hath quite forsaken mee as it is in the straight seas the water ebbes and flowes so is it in the godly in them as long as they liue in this world according to their owne feeling there is an accesse and recesse of the spirit otherwhiles they be troubled with deadnesse and dulnesse of heart as dauid was who prayed to the lord to quicken him according to his louing kindnesse that hee may keepe the testimonie of his mouth and in an other place hee sayth that god promises quickned him which could not be vnlesse he had been troubled with great dulnesse of heart againe somtime the spirit of god quite withdraweth it selfe to their feeling as it was in dauid in the day of my trouble sayth hee i sought the lord and my soule refused comfort i did thinke vpon god and was troubled i prayed and my spirit was full of anguish againe will the lord absent himselfe for euer and will he shew no more fauour hath god forgotten to be mercifull ampc the church in the canticies coplaineth of this in my bed i sought him by night whom my soule loued i sought him but i found him not and againe my welbeloued put in his hand by the hoale of the doore and my heart was affectioned towardes him i rose vp to open to my welbeloued amp my hands did drop downe mirrhe my fingers poure mirrhe vpon the handles of the barre i opened to my welbeloued but my welbeloued was gone and past mine heart was gone when hee did speake i sought him but i could not finde him i called but he answered me not contrariwise god at some other times sheds abroad his loue most aboundantly in the heartes of the faythfull and christ lyeth betweene the breastes of his church as a poesie of mirrhe giuing a strong smell but how can he be a christian that feeles no grace nor goodnesse in himselfe the childe which as yet can vse no reason is for all that a reasonable creature and the man in a swounde feeles no power of life and yet he is not dead the christian man hath many quames come ouer his heart and he falles into many a swounde that none almost would looke for any more of the life of christ in him yet for all that hee may be a true christian this was the state of peter when he denied our sauiour christ with cursing and banning his fayth only fainted for a time it fayled not i haue now opened vnto you the chiefe thinges that trouble mee and your comfortable answeres haue much refreshed my troubled minde the god of all mercie and consolation requite you accordingly i haue spoken that which god out of his holy word hath opened vnto me if you find any helpe thereby giue god the prayse therefore and carrie this with you for euer that by many afflictions both in the body and the minde you must enter into the kingdome of heauen raw flesh is noysome to the stomacke and is no good nourishment before it be sodden and vnmortified man and woman be no creatures fit for god and therefore they are to be soaked and boyled in afflictions that the fulsomenesse and ranckenesse of their corruption may be delayed amp that they haue in them some rellish acceptable vnto god and to conclude for the auoyding of all these temptations vse this sweete prayer following which that godly man m bradford made oh lord god and deare father what shall i say that feele all things to be in maner with me as in the wicked blinde is my minde crooked is my will amp peruerse concupiscence is in mee as a spring of stinking puddle o how faint is fayth in mee how little is my loue to thee or thy people how great is my selfeloue how hard is my heart by reason whereof i am mooued o doubt of thy goodnesse towardes mee whether thou article my mercifull father and whether i be thy child or no indeed worthily might i doubt if that the hauing of these were the cause and not the fruite rather of thy children the cause why thou article my father is thy mercifull goodnesse grace amp trueth in christ iesus which can not but remaine for euer in respect whereof thou hast borne me this good will to bring mee into thy church by baptisme and to accept me into the number of thy children that i might be holy faythfull obedient and innocent and to call mee diverse times by the ministerie of thy word into thy kingdome beside the innumerable other benefites alwaies hitherto powred vpon me all which thou hast done of this thy good will which thou of thine owne mercie bearest to mee in christ before the world was made the which thing as thou requirest straightly that i should beleeue without doubting so wouldest thou that i in all my needes should come vnto thee as to a father and make my moane without mistrust of being heard in thy good time as most shall make to my comfort loe therefore to thee deare father i come through thy son our lord our mediatour and aduocate iesus christ who sitteth on thy right hand making intercession for me i pray thee of thy great goodnesse and mercie in christ to be mercifull to me a sinner that i may in deed feele thy sweete mercie as thy child the time o deare father i appoynt not but i pray thee that i may with hope still expect and looke for thy helpe i hope that as for a litle while thou hast left me so thou wilt come and visit me and that in thy great mercie whereof i haue great need by reason of my great miserie thou article wont for a litle season in thine anger to hide thy face from them whom thou louest but surely o redeemer in eternall mercies thou wilt shew thy compassion for when thou leauest vs o lord thou dost not leaue vs very long neither dost thou leaue vs to our losse but to our lucre and aduantage euen that thy holy spirit with bigger portion of thy power and vertue may lighten and cheare vs that the want of feeling of our sorrow may be recompenced plentifully with the liuely scent of hauing thee to our eternall ioy and therefore thou swearest that in thine euerlasting mercie thou wilt haue compassion on vs of which thing to the end wee might be most assured thine oath is to be marked for thou sayest as i haue sworne that i wil neuer bring any more the water to drowne the world so haue i sworne that i will neuer more be angrie with thee nor reprooue thee the mountaines shall remooue and the hilles shall fall downe but my louing kindnes shal not mooue and the bond of my peace shal not faile thee thus sayest thou the lord our mercifull redeemer deare father therefore i pray thee remember euen for thine owne trueth and mercies sake the promise amp euerlasting couenant which in thy good time i pray thee to write in my heart that i may know thee to be the onely true god and iesus christ whom thou hast sent that i may loue thee with all my heart for euer that i may loue thy people for thy sake that i may be holy in thy sight through christ that i may alwayes not onely striue against sin but also ouercome the same dayly more and more as thy children doe aboue all thinges desiring the sanctification of thy name the comming of thy kingdome the doing of thy will on earth as it is in heauen ampc through iesus christ our redeemer mediatour and aduocate amen those temptations shall be laide to your charge wherevnto you yeelde ampc yeelde not therefore but resist as saint i mes biddeth no motion shall hurt you wherevnto you giue not consent in heart you haue no sinne which in heart you long to be freed from you want no goodnesse which in heart you couet to haue where sicknesse is at the highest there is hope of diminishing so likewise in temptation it is a great mercie of god to discerne a temptation in time of temptation when you would doe any good or receiue any good offer vp your endeauours actions and meanes in a sacrifice to god in christ beseeching god to giue his holy spirit to sanctifie his owne sacrifice if you haue receiued but a litle release of temptation giue thankes and you shall haue more it is a sinne aswell to denie god giftes as to presume of them temptations smoothereth as fire burnes more inwardly be perswaded alwayes you are in the presence of god amp his christ and frame your actions accordingly be more afraide of secret sinnes then of open shame lay this foundation sure that there is mercie with christ iesus remember the former mercies you haue receiued and thinke your present estate to be none other then the estate of god children if you be grieued pray to god if relieued prayse him there is a vicessitude of griefe and comfort as of light and darknesse beware of a discontented minde in any case yes be contented to haue your desires denied you of god and if your prayer be not heard of god vexe not your selfe too much neither vehemently couet nor be grieued for any thing sauing the hauing or losse of the fauour of god labour for meeknes amp patience and be readie to kisse the rodde and to offer vp all to him of whom you haue receiued your selfe for if you struggle it will fare with you as with a birde in a grinne the more she striueth the faster she is we must vse the word in troubles amp temptations as a sicke man doth his meat which though he eate against the stomacke and presently feeleth no benefite of it yet we know by experience it doth him good and himselfe afterwards shall perceiue it the patient bearing of miserie is an acceptable sacrifice to god for when the gold smith putteth a peece of gold into the fire to make better vse of it it seemeth to the vnskilfull that he vtterly marreth it so the children of god in affliction seeme to the iudgement of the naturall man vndone and brought to nothing but spirituall thinges are spiritually discerned beleeue alwayes your estate to be the worke of god and vary not therein for your humiliation your consolation is the glory of god and the good of many others beware that you doe not often alter your iudgement of your estate as saying sometimes it is god worke sometimes melancholy somtimes your weakenesse and simplicitie sometimes witcherie sometimes sathan for the diverse thoughts wil much trouble you you may thinke melancholy to be an occasion but no cause amp so of the rest therfore looke steadfastly to the hand of god surely trusting on this that hee not onely knoweth thereof but that whatsoeuer is done directly or indirectly by meanes or immediatly all is done and gouerned by his diuine prouidence for our good say not you cannot be helped for that may hinder the worke of god say not if i were in such a place and such a place i should be well for god is infinite and therefore euery where aswell where you are as where you would be whereas in consideration of the falling away of many excelling you both in the ages and graces of the new birth you feare you shall not perseuere vnto the end your meditating and collection is good so long as it preserues you from the carelesnesse of the flesh but it is euill when it would dissolue the assurednesse of your fayth indeed so long as you looke vpon your selfe you haue cause to feare because you are vnable to prolonge as you are to begin new birth but if you looke to god you haue nothing but matter of fayth for that when he once loueth he loueth for euer againe as a man swimming in the deepe of water is neuer in danger of drowning so long as his head continueth aboue the water so though you swim in deepe seas of dangerous temptations yet are you sure and secure because christ iesus your head is still aboue all your troubles and therefore able to draw you his members to the shoare of saluation without all perill of perishing beleeue that god the father doth gouerne your temptation that the holy ghost shall and doth assist you that iesus christ was tempted to ouercome in you that the saintes on earth doe pray for you euen those which neuer knew you but doe pray for the tempted ones none can iudge of the worke of the spirit but by the light of the spirit as none can iudge of the sun but by it selfe dispute not with god least you be confounded nor with sathan least you be ouercome be euer perswaded your punishment is farre beneath your sinne in such multitudes of god mercies as you inioy maruell not you haue some crosses least wee should despaire likewise crosses with blessinges least we should presume in any outward blessing which you see you can not haue beg god you may neuer be vexed for it no shame griefe or sorrow pleaseth the lord which goeth altogeather separated from a sweete perswasion of his fauour againe our pleasing our selues in the assurance of pardon is not acceptable to god which altogeather respecteth the care of espying bewayling and auoyding of sinne wherefore let this be the barre and bond of your affection in these cases so long as christ goeth with you so long as the mercies of god accompanie you so long as the grace of the spirit shineth vpon you be dealing with your sinnes amp condemne the vnto death likewise while you are tender of conscience afrayde of sinne reuerently perswaded to walke holily with your god laugh at sathans accusation despise destruction set at naught the terrours of hell you neuer erre but by fayling of one or both these poyntes that is eythere in your griefes you are grieued without comfort or in your ioyes you reioyce without reuerence and as in vnnecessarie griefes you find no spirituall pleasure so in vnaduised ioyes you can finde no spirituall profit it is the pollicie of sathan to blind and besot with a quiet possession of an vniust mirth thereby to keepe them from the true sight of their sinnes so to oppresse the sweete flocke of christ with false and causelesse feares thereby to keepe them from the glorious feeling of their redemption hee knoweth to his griefe that ioy may be temporally interrupted but not finally or eternally be denyed you therefore he plyeth himselfe though he cannot extinguish it yet to diminish your iust and royall right in your christ in regard whereof you stand guiltie of not maintayning the lordes royaltie giuen to the elect if in the least measure you yeeld to these slauish feares of the aduersarie this subtill serpent is not ignorant that by these pensiue practises he doth weare to a dulnesse the edge of your prayers amp that he draweth from you with an vncomfortable teadiousnesse the fruites of your fayth and consequently by these meanes you are depriued of the fruite of a more comfortable seruice to your god the weake ones fearing also by your example the profession of christ to be strickt and comfortlesse a straight course of religion is somewhat an vncomfortable companion but blessed be that mortification which so farre estrangeth vs from the world that it changeth vs to the similitude of christ to whom we must be confirmed in sufferings that wee may be like him in glory suffer not your heart to be straight narrow and vncomfortable in heauenly thniges this draweth away both the breath blood and life of true godlinesse the lord keepe you from euill the lord satisfied you with gladnes the lord giue you the spirit of prayer and heare your prayers the lord be your teacher and your comfort oh pray pray pray it is the best sacrifice to god and the most comfortable duetie you can doe i am not loath to put you in mind of these things you haue many carfull for you in other thinges oh pardon mee if i be bold in this one thing i trust i reioyce more in the good of your soule then euer i should reioyce in the fruite of mine owne body it should bee a thousand deathes yes a thousand hels vnto mee to see your soule miscarrie oh let me be accepted more then a ciuill friend more then a frind of the world giue mee this benefite to be thought further then a friend of the flesh the scriptures doth teach vs that all sicknes of body proceedeth from god as appeareth by these places the lord shall make pestilence to cleaue vnto thee vntill he hath consumed thee from the land whither thou goest to possesse it the lord shall smite thee with the consumption and with a feuer and with a burning ague and with feruent heate the hand of the lord was against the citie with a very great destruction and he smote the man of the citie both small amp great and they had emrods in their secret partes in that god is the author of sicknesse we may learne these lessons wee must not ascribe our sicknesse to chaunce or fortune for it is the will of god looke not too much to the meanes of thy sicknesse as to cold surfeting infected houses ampc but lift vp thine eyes to heauen remembring that the lord hath sent it storme not against sicknesse with murmuring or impatience for thou canst not resist it the lord hath sent it and who hath resisted his will iu sicknesse seeke to the lord for remedie for he sent it amp he must take it away so it is written come and let vs returne to the lord for he hath spoyled and he will heale vs he hath wounded vs and he will binde vs vp wee must not therefore either seeke ease by unlawful meanes as by witchcraft coniuring charming ampc for ahazia is rebuked for that in his sicknesse he sent to aske counsell concerning his recouerie of baal zebub the god of ekron depend too much vpon the lawful meanes as vpon the phisition ampc it is noted for the sinne in asa that being diseased in his feete hee sought not the lord in his disease but to the phisitios that is the phisitions onely the scripture doth teach vs that the sinne of man is commonly the cause why he is smitten with sicknesse if you will not obey me nor doe all the commaundementes ampc then will i also doe this vnto you i will appoynt ouer you fearefulnes or a hastie plague a consumption and the burning ague to consume the eyes and to make the heart heauie dauids mistrust in numbring the people was scourged with a plague of three score and ten thousand man of the plague we haue among the rest these particular sinnes set downe as the causes of it the neglect of god seruice moses and aaroa desire pharaos leaue to goe and sacrifice to the lord in the desart least for want thereof he bring vpon them the pestilence the abuse of the sacraments for this cause saith paul that is for abusing the lord supper as is before in that chapter many are weake and sicke among you and many sleepe disobedience to gouernours the israelites for rebelling against moses and aaron dyed of the plague fourteene thousand and seauen hundred murmuring against god the israelites murmured against god because he led them no sooner into the land of canaan and because the land was no better therefore threatned to smite them with the pestilence and to destroy them and no doubt these sinnes and offences principally are among others the most sensible amp apparant causes of the plague among vs in that sinne is commonly the cause of sicknesse learne these less ns looke not too much on the meanes whereby or the manner how thou article afflicted but looke especially to thy sinne as the principall cause of it wee say commonly i tooke my sicknesse by such a iourney by such a surfet in such an infected house ampc true those were the outward meanes but it was thy sinne within thee which prouoked god to offer those meanes to thee and to make them strong and effectuall to afflict thee when thou article visited with sicknesse enter into examination of thine owne heart what sinnes do principally raigne in thee and doe prouoke god to smite thee in that maner by fasting and prayer amp repentaunce turne to the lord thy god that he may in mercy forgiue thy sinne and consequently take away thy affliction learne thereby to loath amp auoyde sinne which so incenseth god and afflicteth thee but note by the way that sinne is not alwayes the cause of the crosse as may appeare by the answer of christ to his disciples cocerning the man which was borne blind those that are afflicted are not alwaies greater sinners then others as appeareth by the answere of christ to those which shewed him of the galileans whose blood pilate had mingled with their owne sacrifices therefore when thou seest thy neighbour afflicted neither iudge him rashly to be worse then thy selfe nor excuse thy selfe presumptuously to be better or more righteous then hee god which is infinitely good seeketh nothing in afflicting his children but their good as namely he doth visit vs with sicknesse for these causes to draw vs to repentance amp amendement of life least our sinne be our destruction when we are iudged we are chastened of the lord because wee should not be condemned of the world to humble the pride of our hearts by the feeling of our owne frayltie and miserie when he humbled their hearts with heauinesse they fell downe and there was no helper to try amp examine vs whether we still stand as fast to god in the time of aduersitie as we seemed amp promised to stand to him in the time of prosperitie christ when he suffered is sayd to be tempted and they that suffer are sayd to be tempted that is tryed and prooued in affliction as gold is tryed in the furnace to shake off from vs carnall securitie for prosperitie maketh vs carelesse in my prosperitie i sayd i shall neuer be m oued for thou lord of thy goodnesse hadest made my mountaine to stand strong but thou didest hide thy face and i was troubled therefore this must teach vs to apply our sicknesse vnto the right end not the more the hand of god is vpon vs the more to harden our heartes as pharaoh did in aeg pt but our visitation must make vs better namely it must make vs more penitent for our sinnes more humble in heart more steadfast in fayth and more watchfull ouer our soules least that if wee profite not by so effectuall a meanes our sicknesse be vnto vs but the beginning of euils let the sicke man consider that his visitation is sent of god who is rich in mercie amp abaundant in goodnesse and trueth and loueth him in christ from thence he shall gather that god correcteth him of loue as a father and punisheth him not as a iudge god will lay no more vpon him then he will make him able to beare god will giue an issue to the temptation in due time as shalbe best for him let the sicke man consider how little his paine is in respect of that which god could send doth thy head ake or thy heart pant or thy foote or belly grieue thee is one member distressed yet is not thy case like iobs all his members were afflicted at once hee was smitten with boyles from the soale of his foote vnto his crowne is thy whole body afflicted yet is not thy case like dauids when being distressed in soule he cryed out saying my heart trembleth within me and the terrours of death are come vpon me feare and trembling are come vpon me and an horrible feare hath couered me is thy soule distressed yet is not thy affliction like those which lie yelling in hell in fire inquenchable weeping and wayling and gnashing their teeth and haue not so much as a drop of cold water to coole their tongue then thinke thus with thy selfe is one member grieued god could smite all am i heart sicke god could inlarge mine heart and therewith all my paine seauen fold more am i distressed in soule god could giue me ouer into desperation am i distressed both in body and soule god could throw both body amp soule into hell fire thus mayest thou gather comfort in thy greatest paine by considering how much lesse thy paine is then god is able to inflict let the sicke man consider how much lesse his paine is then he deserueth all are gone out of the way and in many things we offend all now the reward of sinne is death that is the curse of god hel fire vtter confusion both of body amp soule the damned in hell would gladly suffer the panges of death for euer that they might be eased of their tormentes but for a while thus mayst thou gather comfort to thy selfe by considering how sparingly the lord scourgeth thee when as for thy desert he might vtterly confound thee let the sicke man consider that the best saintes of god haue been subiect to the like distresse and haue been visited with the like crosse of sicknesse jacob wrestled with god and preuayled with man yet subiect to sicknesse job an vpright man and a iust yet was he smitten with vlcers from the head to the foote elizeus an holy prophet the spirit of elijah was double vpon him yet he sickened and dyed hezekiah an holy king there arose none like him either before or after him yet was he sicke to the death jesus loued lazarus yet he sickened and died of it of this meditation the sicke man may gather this comfort surely notwithstanding my sicknesse my part may be among the holy patriarkes prophets and saints of god beloued of iesus christ for thus were they visited yes this argueth that i am of their number for god scourgeth euery son that he receiueth let the sicke man consider how great the ioyes of heauen are which are layd vp in store for him if he patiently abide the lordes visitation euen such as the eye hath not seene neither hath the eare heard neither is the heart able to conceiue so will hee say with paul i count that the afflictions of this present time are not worthy of the glory which shall be shewed to vs thus will the hope of the ioy to come asswage the paine of the present maladie let the sicke man consider that such thinges christ himselfe suffered and so entred into his glorie and now being in his glorie he seeth feeleth and pittieth the distresse of his members for we haue not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities but was in all thinges tempted in like sort amp therefore knoweth the better to pittie vs from this meditation will arise this comfort doth hee which redeemed mee both see and feele mine afflictions surely then will the same my redeemer comfort me in measure sufficient amp release me in time conuenient concerning spirituall thinges let the sicke man thus exercise himselfe let him be occupied in prayer in which prayer let him craue of god the sight of his sinnes sorrow for his sinnes forgiuenes of his sinnes fayth to beleeue that his sinnes are forgiuen patience and constancie in his trouble deliuerance in good time which way it pleaseth god so are we commaunded to doe and so haue the sainctes left vs an example is any man afflicted let him pray is any merrie let him sing psalmes ezekiah being sicke turned his face to the wall and prayed to the lord let him be occupied in reading of the word for he shall find examples of god mercie shewed vpon the afflicted comfortable promises of strength and deliuerance made to the saints instructio how to beare and what vse to make of his visitation all these and more then these shal he find in the word whereof dauid sayd thy word is sweeter then hony and the hony combe except thy law had been my delight i should haue perished in mine affliction let him meditate of the other life which he is passing vnto where he shal haue saboth vpon saboth that is rest for euer more where the lord shall wipe away all teares from his eyes and there shall be no more death neither sorrow neither crying neither shall there be any more paine for the first thinges that is the worst thinges are there passed ouer concerning temporall thinges let the sicke man obserue these poyntes let him seeke the helpe of the physition amp all other lawful meanes of recouering health honour thy physition for thy necessities sake for god hath created him the lord healeth not now either miraculously as he did peters wiues mother or contrary to meanes as he did hezekiah with a cluster of figges or the eyes of the blind with clay but he smyteth by meanes and he healeth by meanes to that end hath he giuen to man the knowledge of the secrets and properties of naturall thinges and to that end also hath he put that nature and strength into hearbes spice rootes ampc that they may be soueraigne to our diseases so that whosoeuer despiseth in sicknesse the lawful meanes which god offereth for recouerie that man is guiltie of his owne blood in the presence of the lord let him dispose the goods of this world which god hath giuen him by his will and testament isaiah the prophet willeth hezekiah to put his house in order because he should die and not liue of this so doing will follow this good hee may dispose of his goodes which god hath lent him as they may most glorifie god which gaue them after his decease hee

and so mightest thou had not the lord defended thee from it to meditate vpon thy sinnes thy deliuerance from the guilt and punishment thereof by christ as also vpon the changes and alterations in the

shall commune with thee when thou wak st amp guide thee when thou walkest as euerie day a true christian so soone as hee is waking should awake with god so specially vpon this day which the lord commaundeth so straightly to be kept holy vnto himselfe and therefore vpon the saboth day early thou must awake with god and separate thine affections from all earthly thinges and thou must haue a care to be stirring somewhat more betimes vpon this day then vpon the other dayes that so thou mayest beginne to keepe it holy euen at the very beginning of the day being risen assemble thy familie togeather ioyntly vpon your knees with humble amp sincere deuotion make your prayers vnto him humbly thanking his diuine maiestie for all his benefites particularly for his protection ouer you the

there assembled learne to demeane thy selfe after this manner when thou article entring into the house of god into the church the place of publike meeting looke vnto both thy feete sayth salomon that is consider whither thou article going and what to doe for the place thou article going into is god house there thou goest to heare god speaking vnto thee by his minister and to speake vnto him by prayer and therefore looke that thou come thither with a zealous and godly preparation when thou article thither come if the publike exercise be not yet begunne then as soone as thou commest into thy seate fall downe vpon thy knees and make this or some such like oratorie meditation o most mightie and eternall god before whose presence togeather with the rest of this congregation i vile and sinfull wretch at this time doe present my selfe to heare thy holy word and to offer vp the sacrifice of prayer and thankes giuing vnto thee blesse i beg thee this our meeting sanctifie and prepare my heart that it may be apt and fitte for this exercise which now we haue in hand enflame my heart with zeale and teach me how to pray open mine eares that i may heare and mine heart that i may vnderstand that which shall at this time out of thine holy word be taught vnto mee take from me all wandring and by thoughts and graunt that now and euer i may heare thy word effectually and pray vnto thee sincerely through iesus christ this preparation made and the publike exercises beginning in the publike prayer of the assemble bee not rash with thy mouth to vtter a thing before god for god is in the heauen and thou article on earth therefore let thy wordes be few thinke not that the mumbling ouer a few prayers doth merit at god hands or that thou shalt be heard for thy much babling but let thy prayer come from thine heart when the minister prayeth in the behalfe of the whole congregation let thine heart ioyne with him oft times stirre vp thy selfe in prayer and rouze thy selfe vp from thy naturall dulnesse and backwardnesse in this kind by inward sighes and grones and take heed that thy heart be not tossed about with vaine imaginations and fantasies when thou shouldest lift vp pure handes and heart as the apostle speaketh vnto god the like obserue in the singing of psalmes which is a kind of prayer then after publike prayer in time of the sermon when the word of god is preached before thee remember the counsell of the wise man be neare to heare that is be attentiue hearken with reuerence to that which shall be deliuered which that thou mayest the better doe obserue these directions haue thine eye fixed most commonly on the preacher that so thou mayest keepe it and thy thoughts from idle wandring marke the text obserue his deuision marke how euery poynt is handled quote the place of scripture which he alleadgeth for his doctrine proofe fold downe a leafe in your bible fro whence the place is recited that so at your leasure after your returne fro the church you may examine it apply that which is spoken to thy selfe and endeauour to be bettered by it continue in thy attentiue hearing without wearinesse from the beginning vnto the end of the sermon and see that thou depart not vnlesse infirmitie of health or some other very necessarie occasion call thee away before with the rest of the congregation by after prayer and singing of psalmes thou hast rendred thankes for the comfort and instruction which thou hast receiued after the returne from church reuiue thy memorie with a briefe repetition in thy minde of that which thou hast heard before thy sitting downe to dinner amp then with thanksgiuing receiuing the blessing of god to thy bodily comfort be mindfull to season the same with good and godly talke to the glory of god the comfort of thy

lordes day the lord may giue thee an holy amp quiet rest and prosper thee the better the weeke following yes the whole residue of thy life as concerning the sacraments when the sacraments of baptisme is to be administred haste not foorth of the church as many doe but continue thy presence that there thou mayest aright vnto thy comfort consider with thy selfe thine owne receiuing heretofore into the visible body of christs church and congregation as also that thou mayest offer prayers vnto god for the infant which is to be baptized like as others did heretofore for thee and for the sacrament of the supper of the lord so prepare thy selfe according to the direction in the catechisme as to be ready to receiue it if it may be euen so often as thou shalt perceiue it to be administered and when thou approchest to the table of the lord to receiue it come with all reuerence and let thine heart be rapt with heauenly meditation when thou seest the bread amp wine deliuered let thine heart within thee meditate so zealously amp feruently vpon the passion of our blessed lord and sauiour for thy redemption as if with thine owne eyes thou diddest then behold his body nayled on the crosse and his precious blood shedde for thy sake let this and such like meditations enter into thy minde and be not found vnthankfull in reading first take heede what booke thou doest read that they be not leawd and wanton nor needlesse and vnprofitable not sauouring of popish superstition but either the holy scriptures or other sound and godly authors in reading of the scriptures read not heere and

selues and our prayers vnto thee in the name and mediation of thy son our sauiour humbly beging and crauing both these our former petitions and all things else needfull for vs in that forme of prayer which he hath taught vs saying our father which article in heauen ampc that i be carefull to keepe a better vvatch ouer my thoughts words or deedes then heretofore i haue done to doe them more vvarily for god glory mine owne comfort and my brethrens benefit that i cleanse my heart from the very first motions of all sinfull thoughts as of lust anger envy pride couetousnesse malice stubbornesse euill suspicion knowing that the least sinne deserueth death and doth depriue me of part of the comfort of my saluation that all my lawful affections be moderate and without excesse and greater alwayes vpon heauenly things then on earthly that i fulfill not my minde in all things for then shall i often sinne i must therefore consider whether that be lawful which i doe desire and for the glory of god that i bestow no more care or thought vpon the world then i must needs for the moderate maintayning of my selfe and those that belongs to mee lest my thoughts be too much distracted from heauenly things that i suffer not my minde to be occupied with vnprofitable cares or vaine meditations for which i cannot giue a sufficient reason to god or man if i were asked that i thinke better of my brother then of my selfe and the more that i excell in any thing the more humble i be before god and man that i take some time euery day to meditate vpon the word of god or some other good bookes and the rather for the miseries of the time and the iniquirie of the age wherein i liue and pray to god for remedie that i thinke often on the vanitie of my life vpon my departure hence daily looking for my sauiour in the clouds and wishing rather a godly life then a long that i carefully meditate and remember euery good thing that i heare or learne that i may readily practise it when time and occasion shall serue that i remember that such as my speech is such is my heart for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh and that both my heart and mouth goe together that my speech be gracious to the edification good and benefit of them with whom i speake and not to their euill or sinning that my speech be alwayes more and more ioyfull earnest and comfortable when i speake of heauenly things then earthly things and matters that i remember i shall answere for euery idle word that multitude of words be often sinfull let me speake therefore as few as i may yes to be rather silent then to speake vnprofitably that my words be no greater or any more then my matter deserueth nor beare a shew of vice in me or of any excessiue affection that as i beleeue not all things that are told mee so i tell not all i heare but tell the truth onely though not alwaies that i delight not to speake of other mens infirmities especially behinde their backes and speaking before them with griefe and wisedome that i speake not of god but with reuerence knowing that i am not worthy to take his name in my mouth that in praises i be discreete in salutations courteous in admonitions brotherly that i vse daily prayer to god euery morning noone and euening that he would guide me in my affaires for his glory and mine owne comfort that i register vp all my sinnes committed against him in euery matter and with griefe bewaile them at fit time crauing pardon for them and strength against them that euery day something of god word be read and meditated on that i may thereby increase in godlinesse that whatsoeuer i take in hand i first take counsell at god word whether it be lawful or no be it for my profit or pleasure and then that i doe it with prayer at least in my heart that i giue thankes to god for euery benefit i receiue and then dedicate the same for promoting of his glory and the benefit of his chruch that i sanctifie god sabbath duely in vsing the holy exercises of prayer preaching meditating and receiuing the sacraments at their time that any meanes that god hath appoynted for any matter be not more relied vpon then god himselfe but that hee be first prayed vnto for the prosperous vse of the meanes that i sticke to god as well in aduersitie as in prosperitie knowing the one to be as necessary for mee as the other yet let me pray for my necessaries and be humble when i haue them that i vse them well that i lose them not that i marke my profiting in religion prepare my selfe to heare god word attend when i am there consider and meditate of it after my departure that i loue all things for god sake and god onely for his owne that i make god my friend and then nothing can bee mine enemie and couet in all things to serue god sincerely that i refraine my eares from hearing my eyes from seeing my soule and body from fulfilling any vaine or wicked thing that my apparrell meate and recreation be needfull lawful amp moderate that with all care i redeeme the time knowing that i shall answer for euery idle houre that i bee as sorrowfull for the good deedes i haue omitted as i am ioyfull of the good deedes i haue fulfilled that my especiall sinnes and corruptions be inquired into and thought vpon vvith griefe vvhether they are weakned in me or remaine still in their olde strength and whether i resist them with more amp more faithfulnes euery day that i remember with humility all the good motions and actions god worketh in me that they be pledges of my saluation spurres to godlinesse and comfort against tentations that i suffer not my selfe to bee pleased with vnprofitablenesse that is with vnwillingnesse toward good that i follow my lawful calling so carefully for the good of god church or common wealth as feeling my misery by adam i be humble thereby that i take reuenge of my selfe for my slippery sinnes or sinning beating downe my body that i sinne not againe that i neuer make more shew of holinesse outwardly then i haue inwardly in heart that i remember that whatsoeuer i haue which may be vsed toward others god hath bestowed the same vpon me for others benefit that i count it not sufficient that i my selfe serue god onely but also that i cause all that are in my charge by all meanes to doe the same that i consider that i am but god steward in his benefits he hath lent me amp therefore i ought to imploy them vvisely to those that need heartily amp intirely that i behaue my selfe toward all so sincerely that i may win the weake comfort the strong and make ashamed the wicked that as i receiue good in company so i doe them some good to my power that when i know others to sinne i mourne for it and amend it if i may by brotherly admonition that i reioyce and praise the lord for any good thing that he sendeth vnto man acknowledging it is for mine and other godlies sake through christ that god vpholdeth the world that i striue not vvhether they should do good to me or i to them first but that i benefit euen mine owne enemy knowing my reward is with god that i be carefull to vse the good i can receiue by any man knowing i am but a member of the body and stand in need of other members that i carefully craue the prayers of other brother and their praises to god also for the gifts i haue receiued and so shall i feele my fellowship in the body more effectually the word of the lord teacheth vs that it is not onely required of maisters parents and hous holders that they them selues haue a care to liue in the feare of god but also they ought to see their whole families to doe the same and that this charge is laide on them note these places of scripture following for as we are maisters and fathers in earth and looke to be serued and obeyed so i acknowledge for mine owne part that i haue a father and maister in heauen whose will i must obey in gouerning the people committed to my charge according to his will this did faithfull abraham called the father of the faithfull genes whose example by god assistance i intend in some measure to follow to shew my dutifull obedience that the lord may shew his mercy on me and mine as he promised and performed to abraham and therefore haue taken this order for the gouernment of my house as followeth first because our god hath sanctified one day to himselfe that is the sabbath i ordaine amp command that all my people shal repaire to the church accompanying me both fore noone and after noone there to stay amp abide during the exercise of the word of god read and preached prayers and partaking of the sacraments and shall behaue themselues there reuerently as those that come to appeare before god maiestie none shall trauell on the sabbath without vrgent necessitie nor absent themselues from the church without iust cause made knowne before to me none shall vse at that day running to reuels haunting of ale houses ampc but spend the time after the publique exercise of the word in such godly manner as god teacheth in his word as reading the scriptures singing of psalmes talking of his commaundements and meditating of god creatures to his glory againe seeing the sabboth is the market day or day of preparing food for our soules euery one shall being demanded giue an accompt of some thing that hee hath learned as wel in the church to the minister as also in my priuate house when i my selfe or some other by mine appoyntment shall examine him that i may know how he hath spent the sabboth and profited in knowledge secondly i ordaine and take order that euery morning there be a generall meeting of my servant before they goe about their ordinary businesse all excuses set apart ioyning themselues together and commending themselues to god by faithfull and hearty prayer amp blessing without which our watching and labour is in vaine as dauid noteth also our rest and sleepe being a gift of god for the obtayning whereof i appoint in like manner that there shall be euery euening the like assembling of all my people worldly excuses put apart to bestow together some conuenient time in prayer singing of psalmes and reading the scriptures or some other godly matter thirdly seeing the creatures of god are sanctified vnto vs by the word of god and prayer and that wee ought not to receiue them without giuing thankes to god for them as saint paul teacheth therefore i commaund that some one in the behalfe of the rest both before and after meate whensoeuer they receiue it doe with all reuerence praise god for the same the residue yeelding consent by their reuerent silence fourthly concerning the common behauiour of my people euery where i straitly forbid to sweare in vaine by the reuerend name of god or otherwise to vse it vainely and vnreuerently i vtterly forbid all iesting and scoffing at god most sacred word his true religion the preachers and the professors of the same all cursing lying slandering and filthy and vncleane talking i vtterly forbid all maintenance of popery and superstition and what else soeuer may offend the maiestie of god if any offend against these or any of these orders aboue mentioned through weaknesse and not of malice he shall be once gently admonished mat if he offend the second time to be more sharply reproued timoth but if he offend the third time he shall confesse his fault before the vvhole household assembled together shewing himselfe sorrowfull for his fault crauing pardon of god and reconcile himselfe to the houshold whom he hath offended but if there be any of my family that obstinatly refuse to beare this the lord yoke and to be subiect to his ordinance he shall not continue in my house but i learne of dauid psalm a man chosen after god owne heart to driue such wicked ones out of my house and sight and seeke for such as feare god and will make such my servant least entertaining and nourishing the wicked into my house my negligence be punished as was elies who being a hous holder amp a father was said to haue honoured his children more than god because he entertained them without punishment hee was depriued of both his son in one day and himselfe brake his necke ampc sam sam sam and salomon saith that the curse of god is in the house where the wicked are but he powreth his blessings vpon the habitation of the righteous therefore i further adde that such guests as repaire to my house refusing to be subiect to these ordinances of the almightie and will not ioyne with mee and my people to serue the lord i refuse to be companion with such or to receiue him to be my guest for such procure god wrath as afore is said but i will say with dauid psalmes those shall be my companions that feare god and keepe his commandements and those shalbe my guests that be godly iust and feare god and as for the wicked and rebellious against the ordinance of god seeing they are darknesse with whom light hath no communion and seeing they are as pitch very likely to defile a man i will say to such as our sauiour said of the like away from mee ye workers of iniquitie and with that godly house keeper dauid away from me ye wicked for i will keepe the commandements of my god cornelius with his houshold feared god accompt not of your selfe better then you are for the more base you are in your owne conceit the more glorious are ye in the sight of god for god regardeth a lowly minde as the poore publican that did deny himselfe had more fauour in the sight of god then the proud pharisie that boasted of himselfe speake not of god but with reuerence knowing that wee are not worthy to take his name in our mouth much more we ought not to take it vainely hold fast to god aswell in prosperitie as in aduersitie for in aduersitie we come to god but in prosperitie we forget our selues often also if you be in aduersitie despaire not but waight vpon god for deliuerance and he will send it when there is no hope of it to the glory of his owne name and for the good of his children as daniell from the lyons buy and redeeme the time past with repentance looke to the time present with diligence and to the time to come with prouidence let not malice make you to reueale that vvhich friendship bound you once for to conceale in praysing be discreet in saluting courteous and in admonishing brotherly not hastily and angerly reade something of god word daily and doe not onely count it sufficient that you serue god truely your selfe but also looke that all your charge and houshold doe the same truely whatsoeuer blessings yee craue of god aske them in the name of christ for no man commeth to the father but by me saith christ whatsoeuer you take in hand before you doe it aske counsaile of god vvhither it be lawful and then doe it with peace of heart if it be lawful looke that meate apparell amp recreation be needful lawful amp moderate take heede of presumptuous sins for though many presume that god is a god of mercy yet though he be a god of mercy to the penitent yet he is a god of iustice also forsake the world amp flye to god for it is vnpossible that a man louing the world should haue any comfort from god for the loue of the world is enmity with god besides keepe not any thing of the world to you that may draw you from god for god will not haue part of the man but the whole man be alwayes armed against temptations for those that belong to christ must looke for temptations alwayes and thinke not if that ye haue ouercome any temptation once or twice or often that then you are freed for christ was tempted often so were the apostles they had one time peace and then persecution and then peace and after persecution so alwayes an intercourse and when they were in peace they made ready to be armed for temptation knowing that they should haue temptation therefore this life is called a christian warfare besides if yee are tempted and tryed it sheweth manifestly that ye belong to god for god scourgeth euery son that hee receiueth besides those that haue no temptation or tryall it sheweth manifestly they belong to the diuell for what need hath bee to tempt them whom he hath already in bondage flye from all sinnes in generall indeuour and then god will accept your indeuours though weake and imperfect through the perfection of christ and sticke to no darling sinnes for the diuell can as well hold a man insubiection by one sinne as by all sinnes let the words that you speake proceede from the good spirit and not from the flesh for if they doe god abhorreth them as god doth abound in mercy and goodnesse towards you so be you inlarged to him in obedience when ye are tempted at any time by the diuell or his ministers be sure to haue the word of god to answere him for the word is compared to a two edged sword that doth not onely defend vs but also offend our enemy christ he vsed scripture to repell the diuel he could haue driuen the diuel away with the breath of his nostrils but hee did answere him with scripture to shew vs example that if wee were tempted at any time wee should with scripture repell him and that euery one may know them the better they must reade them often vse conference and marking the true meaning of the vvords and conferring one place of scripture with another and praying to god for to giue them the blessing of vnderstanding it truely and the like follow your betters obserue and marke the wise accompany the honest and loue the godly the text is a prayer of moses and it hath three parts the lesson to number our dayes which may be numbred foure wayes the account which moses maketh the dayes of our life are threescore yeeres and ten this number euery child can tell by comparison of three times past which being once gone and and past is nothing now it is past were it a thousand yeeres it is but a thought ii future which being to come it is not yet certaine whether it will be to vs or no iii present which is but at the instant deduction or abstraction thus take from yeeres spent in sleepe and fifteene yeeres of our child hoode the time of our vanitie and tenne yeeres allowed for eating recreating idle talke iourneyes ampc then there will be found but tenne yeeres remaining well spent whereof lord how little is spent in thy seruice these three wayes of numbring may be taught vs by man the fourth way god onely can teach by a christian and heauenly arithmeticke that is so to number as we may by due consideration of the shortnes and vncertaintie of our life apply our hearts vnto wisedome the lesson contains an eleauen points of wisdome to be learned from the vanitie of our life for if by god spirit we be perswaded that euery houre may be our last it will cause vs to set our house in order that is to haue our last will alwayes ready as god charged ezechia esay lest death preuent vs to repent speedily with haste to turne from all our sinnes lest hereafter it be too late while it is called to day harken to beare all affliction with quiet and patient mind seeing they cannot be long patient the lord is at hand to redeeme our time hauing mispent much and the remnant being so little and vncertaine as haruest man and trauellers which haue loytered the forepart of the day the more bestirre themselues the latter part to be fruitfull in all good workes and constant in wel doing without wearinesse seeing the time is short and there will be an end and the hope shall not perish and that wee shall finde all our good workes in life eternall to esteeme wisely of the things of this life which tarry with vs but a while as comforts of our pilgrimage and testimonies of god loue and pledges of better things layd vp in heauen for his so to vse the world as if we did not vse it fixing our delight on god and the things of heauen which wither not to be more studious of holy scripture seeing the things which we are to learne are many and weighty and our space to learne in so little to busie our selues much in the religious education of our children seeing we are shortly to leaue them and religion is the best inheritance vvee can leaue them and wee to leaue them to a wicked world to be full of good counsell toward others and our selues to bee more capable of counsell to thinke euery word of god to be sweet and comfortable to our selues and to feare god the scholler moses vvho had learned the wisedome already yet desireth to be taught how much more cause haue we so to doe the schole maister god by his spirit to whom wee must therefore pray in faith amp submit by our obedience the most iust and mercifull god hauing from euerlasting propounded to glorifie himselfe by mankind and to that end decreed to create all man righteous in adam also to suffer adam for iust cause being left to his owne vvill to fall and by his will in disobedience to enwrap his whole kinde in sinne and death setting all man being now a lumpe of corruption in his sight there vvere some of them in vvhom he tooke pleasure setting his loue on them for no other reason but because he vvould and was pleased so to doe being pleased vvith some hee chose them and seuered them from the rest by eternall election whom he had thus chosen and culled out as it were of the whole lost masse them hee purposed to saue to the glory of his mercy vessels of mercy after this he predestinated that is fore ordained or appointed afore to giue them a sauiour euen his owne son to be incarnate and dye for their redemption and to giue them to him as his peculiar to be grafted in him as his members and made partakers of all his graces according to this fore determination and appointment hee called them in time putting faith into them to receiue christ being offered in the word and sacraments then euen at the same time he iustifieth them by faith in his son he sanctifieth them also by his sp r to liue a new life lastly at the end of their life he glorifieth them as a builder comming to a heape of stones first he liketh some secondly he chuseth them thirdly he purposeth to vse them fourthly he fore ordaines with himselfe to hew them fiftly hee sets man on worke to square them so is god proceeding those that shall be glorified are predestinated to be like to christ first in the end which is glory ioy and dominion in heauen secondly in the meanes which be holinesse of life suffering affliction christ the first borne excelleth all his brother first in nature diuine being the onely begotten son of god humane his manhood being conceiued by the holy ghost secondly in office being that prophet to teach the church perfectly the whole will of god that high priest by sacrifice and intercession to pacifie god wrath that king mightily to protect and rule his people thirdly in glory blisse and dominion you who haue walked in this little garden and gathered such flowers as may make a nosegay smelling sweet vnto your soules amp to expell such stinking weeds of sinne as might bring poyson to the same be not lesse mindfull to apply the soueraigne salue of these sacred comforts to the vpholding of your soules then man are vsed to be for the preseruing and curing of their weake and decayed bodyes and for this purpose behold the carking care of vvorldly man who to aduance themselues in these outward things neuer cease to afflict both soule and body so they may effect what themselues so much desire and that they may the better perceiue the increase of their laborious toyle who doeth not often with a serious eye behold and see into his present estate whereby they may discerne in what estate they stand if therefore man be thus carefull and prouident for those things which concerne this present life both which euen life and estate in a moment may be taken from them and the inioying of them bringeth no true comfort but manifold griefes and sorrowes to the soule how carefull then should wee bee to take an account of our spirituall estate by considering how much more precious the soule is then the body the estate of grace then the state of nature how we haue growne rich in the graces of god spirit which bring not onely true comfort to vs for this present life but giue assured testimonie of eternall happines in the life to come and as no man can truely know his profit or losse in temporary things but by knowing his first and present estate so no man can vvell discerne his progresse and gaines in spirituall things till he truely know his first and naturall estate for the better examination and triall of our spirituall estate let vs consider vvhat wee are by nature the apostle ephesian telleth vs that all man by nature are in the state of condemnation euery man by nature is dead in sinne ephesian he is as a loathsome carraine or a dead corps lying rotting and stinking in the graue hauing in him the seede of all sinne from this estate none are exempted as iob which wofull estate came vpon mankinde by the fall of adam rom we being then in him and now of him that is wee are so descended out of his loynes that of him we haue not onely receiued our naturall and corrupt bodyes but also by propagation haue inherited his foule corruptions as it were by hereditary right this infection extendeth it selfe vniuersally through the whole man both soule and body both reason vnderstanding will and affections ephesian for first in the minde there is nothing but blindnesse and ignorance concerning heauenly matters secondly the conscience is defiled being alwayes eyther benummed with sin or turmoyled with inward accusations and terror thirdly the will of man onely willeth and lusteth after euill fourthly the affections of the heart as loue ioy hope desire ampc are moued and stirred to that which is euill to imbrace it and they are neuer stirred to that which is good vnlesse it be to eschew it lastly the members of the body are the instruments and tooles of the minde for the execution of sinne in this estate no man can please god in whatsoeuer he doth for till we be in the state of grace our best actions are sinnefull as preaching prayer almesdeedes and the like as it is written iob who can bring a cleane thing out of that which is vncleane a man in the state of nature may doe those things vvhich are of themselues good but they vtterly fayle in the manner of doing them they doe them not as they should be done that is in faith loue zeale conscience of obedience neither yet with cheerefulnes delight or feeling but euen as it were forcing themselues to do the outward action as caine the pharises ananias and saphira so long as man be meerely naturall they haue no sight of their owne miserable estate or of the blessed estate of the godly for the naturall man vnderstands not the things that be of god he being at enmity with god and so depriued of his fauour consider his estate in the soule of man there are but two faculties the vnderstanding and the will the spirit of god so discribes his vnderstanding that not onely he saith the naturall man vnderstands not the things that are of god and as if it were not sufficient to expresse mans miserable estate he addeth neither indeed can he vnderstand them because they are spiritually discerned and againe his will hee describes it that it is not subiect to the law of god neither in deede can be hereby we may perceiue the miserable estate of those who are strangers from god what an vnhappy condition of life it is that a man should liue in such an estate wherein doe what hee can hee cannot please god let caine sacrifice with abell let esau with teares seeke a blessing from his father let the pharisie pray in the temple with the publican yet all nor any of these shall please god or goe home iustified and for worldly glory let him be neuer so high amongst man he is but abhominable vnto god in this state he is not onely an enemy to god but in bondage and a slaue to the diuell hauing him to raigne in his heart as god which may be perceiued in that he giueth obedience to him in his heart and expresseth it in his conuersation and this appeareth if he take delight in the euill motions that sathan puts in his hart and doe fulfill the lusts of the diuell and in this estate he continueth neither seeing nor feeling his misery nor desirous to come out of it neither can he be perswaded that hee is in such a wofull case as appeareth in the example of the ruler luke and by the church of laodicia which being poore wretched miserable blinde and naked yet she thought hir selfe rich and wanting nothing thus he remaineth vnder sathans dominion till he be regenerate amp borne againe and so brought into the state of grace so that man liuing amp dying in the state of nature for any thing i see cannot be saued i speake not of infants and children whereof some no doubt are saued by vertue of the promise and couenant through the election of grace seeing then that the estate of a naturall man is most miserable and none growne to yeeres of discretion can be saued for any thing vve know but the regenerte and such as are in the state of grace i vvill therefore for the better tryall of our present estate shew vvhat regeneration is and the properties of those in whomsoeuer this new birth is wrought amp such quallities as doe vsually shew forth themselues in those in whom soeuer the spirit of christ dwelleth regeneration is renewing amp repayring of the decayed estate of our soules or an act of the holy ghost in god elect whereby they are entred into a constant and faithfull exercise of a godly life as there is a naturall birth of the whole man so there is a spirituall birth of the whole man which is where as the naturall faculties of the soule as reason vnderstanding will affection and the members of the body also are so sanctified and purged by grace that we vnderstand vvill and desire that vvhich is good for till a man be borne againe he can no more desire that which is good then a dead man can desire the good things of this life the signes of regeneration are first a true touch of conscience for our sinnes both originall and actuall secondly a godly sorrow and griefe of heart for offending god by our transgressions thirdly an earnest desire after christ and his righteousnesse testified by a constant and diligent vse of the meanes the word prayer and sacraments wherein god giues grace and assurance of mercy fourthly an vnfained turning to god from all sinne by new obedience in life to please god in all things further there are eight signes and tokens whereby all man may certainly know that they are sanctified regenerated and shall be saued first a loue to the children of god secondly a delight in his vvord thirdly often and feruent prayer fourthly zeale of god glory fiftly denyall of our selues sixtly patient bearing of the crosse with profit and comfort seauenthly faithfulnesse in our callings eightly iust and conscionable dealings in all our actions amongst man in whomsoeuer this worke of regeneration is wrought there is euer found the action of mortification for he that is resolued to endeuour his godly repentance and laboureth the reformation of his sinfull life must labour two things principally and of necessirie mortification and regeneration hee must first destroy his sinnefull estate before hee can obtaine the estate of grace for god and the gifts of god are so absolutely holy as that they cannot admit any mixture with sinne and wicked actions mortification is a decay and perishing of the deeds of the flesh by the grace and operation of god spirit vvhich deeds of the flesh are not onely our euill actions but our desires and carnall affections also which mortification of a christian consists in two things first in subduing by an holy discipline our inordinate lusts which naturally rebell against the loue of god secondly in a patient bearing of the crosse of iesus except we make some profit in the first it is certaine we shall neuer proceede in the second wheresoeuer mortification is there is also sanctification seeing that mortification is the forerunner of sanctification hereby we may try how farre we haue gone in the same experience teacheth that the nearer a man drawes to death the lesse motion is in him but being dead he moues not at all so is it with the spirituall man the farther he goes in mortification the greater is his progresse in sanctification by which sanctification trie thy selfe and see whether or no thou hast gotten life by the righteousnesse of christ deceiue not thy owne hart in the matter of saluation assure thy selfe so farre forth thou dost liue as thou article sanctified as health is in the body so is holines in the soule a body without health fals out of one paine into another till it dye and so a soule without holines is polluted with one lust after another till it dye our sanctification must be both in soule and body it is not enough to cleanse the hands feet eyes and tongue but we must goe yet further and be penitent in heart for blessed are the pure in heart such shall receiue the blessing we must consider in this worke of sanctification from the direction of god word whether our thoughts words and workes be cleansed from their inward and outward corruptions and that they be sequestred and made impropriate to god so that if wee haue set our very thoughts apart to god then there is holinesse begun and then we are meete for a sanctified vse so if we be to serue for a holy vse wee must not be for when and for what we list but taken vp in thought word and deed to serue the lord wee are not to bestow our thoughts on all things but refer them to the lord mediately or immediately if our sanctification be effectually wrought in vs it will be constant and continuall so that we shall not deliuer an holinesse to god for a time or in some causes or for some persons but we must throughly fulfill the dayes of our holinesse not presenting a maymed holinesse as in the law it was not permitted to offer a lame or maymed beast though it wanted but the tayle which was a small thing yes euen for that defect the lord refused it there are many professors vvhich would needes be man sanctified but they are loath to be cleansed others when they cannot away with this strictnesse to continue say on this manner let vs prepare river of sinne for christ shed streames of bloud the more we sinne the greater glory will come to christ and thus they stand at a stay their holinesse is a standing holinesse it fils not they still lye in their pollutions their motion is but from the house to the church and from the church home againe and at the yeeres end they are as at the beginning like a horse in a mill that makes many circuits from morning till night and then is but where he was at first from sanctification ariseth repentance for a man cannot hate his sins before he be sanctified amp he cannot truely repent for them before he hate them repentance is a constant returning from all sinne vnto god or an inward sorrowing and continuall mourning for sinne ioyned with faith and humiliation and both inward and outward amendment inward in changing the thoughts and affections of the heart and outward in changing the words and workes from euill to good i say it is a turning not from one sinne vnto another as from whoredome to theft and the like neither is repentance euery sorrow but sorrow for sinne not for some sinne but for all sinne not for an houre but for euer euery sorrow is not repentance for so should worldlings repent euery pant for sinne is not repentance so should pharaoh repent all weeping and lamenting is not repentance so should esau iudas and caine repent euery little humbling of our soules is not repentance for so should ahab repent all good wordes and good purposes is not repentance for so should euery sicke man repent euery cry to god for mercy is not repentance for so should euery foole repent hereby it may appeare what repentance is as also how many are deceiued in repentance and therfore that we may the better try our repentance let vs know that repentance is when a man turnes to god and brings forth fruits worthy amendement of life this turning to god hath two parts the first is a purpose of heart and resolution neuer to sinne any more but to leade a new life the second is an holy endeauour and labour in mans life and conuersation to purifie and cleanse himselfe from sinne for a man must be renewed and come to an vtter disliking of his owne sinne before he will turne from them and leaue them by this it may appeare that there is one manner of sinning in the godly and another in the vngodly though they fall both into one sinne a wicked man when hee sinneth in his heart hee giueth full consent to the sinne but the godly though they fall into the same sinne with the wicked yet they neuer giue full consent for they are in their vvills mindes and affections partly regenerate and partly vnregenerate and therefore their wils doe partly will and partly abhorre that which is euill according to that of paul rom and that the godly man neuer giueth full consent to sinne it is euident by three tokens first before he come to doe the sinne hee hath no purpose or desire to doe it but his purpose and desire is to doe the will of god contrary to that sinne secondly in the act or doing of the sinne his hart riseth against it yet by the force of temptation and by the mighty violence of the flesh hee is exhaled on and pulled to doe wickednesse thirdly after he hath sinned he is sore displeased with himselfe for it and truely repenteth a manifest example hereof wee haue in peter and iudas peter before the denying of his maister had no purpose so to doe but rather to dye in his cause in the act he had a striuing with himselfe as appeares by this that first hee answered faintly i know not what thou sayest and yet after when the assault of sathan more preuayled he fell to swearing cursing and banning after his fall he repented and wept bitterly for it all was contrary in iudas who went with a full intent to betray his maister for the diuell made him yeeld amp fully consent to doe it hauing long tempted him vnto it and entred into him afterwards when christ was betrayed iudas was not sorrowfull for his sin with godly sorrow but in a dispayre of mercy hung himselfe although this which hath beene said may be sufficient to proue our repentance whether true or false good or bad yet to make it more apparant consider seauen special signes set downe by the apostle corinthian the first is care euery one that hath a godly sorrow and true repentance is not sloathfull but diligent not carelesse but carefull to auoid all sin as well as any one as also he is most carefull to doe that which is good not for feare but for loue not because man but because god commandeth the second is a clearing of our selues that is to say when a man hath the feeling of sinne and shunneth it and sathan accusing him he cannot abide and beare that accusation but is disquieted till hee haue gotten pardon of his sinne with as much earnestnesse as for the most waightiest thing in the world confessing the action and inditement and desiring the pardon of it by which hee may be able to answere his accusers the third is indignation making man angry against those sinnes which before they liked yes to be out of patience vvith themselues that they vvere such wretches and so carelesse to be ouer taken with them and to take on as it were with themselues that they haue slipped into such sins for true godly sorrow doth euer bring such indignation the fourth is feare that is an affection fearing sinne because it is sinne fearing to offend god because of his mercy and goodnesse and benefits receiued not flying or departing from god but drawing neerer vnto him when they haue offended him the fift is a desire which is a feruent affection to god and his word amp to spirituall and heauenly things this is manifest in the example of the iaylor who after he was smitten with sorrow and true repentance came with this note to paul saying what shall i doe to be saued the sixt is zeale which maketh man zealous for god and his worship zealous of pietie and good workes not to doe them carelesly and negligently but it maketh them doe though with great labour and cost yes danger and hazard those things which they see they ought to doe the seauenth is reuenge that is the penitent man is so offended with the sin hee hath committed that hee will be reuenged of himselfe for it as for example if hee haue offended in gluttony he will reuenge himselfe by fasting two or three daies after if he haue offended in whoredome hee will be reuenged of his lusts by bewayling of them euer after and so of other sinnes by these it may appeare what true repentance is in whomsoeuer true repentance is thus found it euer proceedeth from a true and iustifying faith for none can repent or practise this duety of repentance but those vvho haue faith and grace without faith it is impossible to please god i will therefore first declare vvhat faith is secondly the tryall of faith thirdly the fruits of faith and lastly how faith is kept faith is a wonderfull grace of god spirit whereby the elect doe apprehend and apply christ and all his benefits vnto themselues particularly to make tryall in our selues whether our faith be true and sound or not this will appeare two wayes first by the beginning and degrees of the workes of the spirit which goe before a true and liuely faith which be three first a true sight of our sinne with an apprehension of the wrath of god for the same secondly a true sorrow and griefe of heart for offending god by these our sinnes and lastly an hungring and thirsting after the mercy and grace of god in christ aboue all worldly things where these things are there is grace but where these things are wanting there is no true faith but presumption secondly faith wil appeare by the work of loue for in loue will saith bring forth all the duties of the morall law both to god and man for faith worketh by loue and loue is the fulfilling of the law further for the tryall of our faith christ tels vs that the more we are distracted with worldly cares the lesse is our beliefe in god for distrustfull care comes from vnbeliefe in god prouidence and the lesse we trust in god for temporall things the lesse doe wee beleeue eternall mercies for the same faith layes hold on both but if we can truely depend vpon god for temporall blessings in the sober vse of lawful meanes then wee shall relie vpon his mercy for the saluation of our soules this tryall is not made in prosperitie for when god sends aboundance euery one will trust in him but vvhen vvant comes then is tryall of thy faith if then thou relie on god though meanes fayle thy faith is strong but if thy heart be opprest vvith sorrow and feare and thou make no conscience of unlawful meanes then suspect thy selfe thy faith is none at all for the iust shall liue by faith thus much of faith and the tryall thereof now follow the fruits and benefits thereof by meanes of this speciall faith the elect are truely ioyned vnto christ and haue a heauenly communion vvith him and therefore doe in some measure feele his holy spirit mouing and stirring in them the elect being thus ioyned to christ there ariseth three wonderfull benefits from it iustification adoption and sanctification iustificationn is when the elect being in themselues rebellious sinners and god owne enemy yet by christ they are accepted of the lord as perfectly pure and righteous before him from true iustification proceedeth many other benefits the first is reconciliation by vvhich a man iustified is perfectly reconciled to god because his sinne is done away and hee is perfectly arayed with the righteousnes of christ the second is that afflictions to the faithfull are no punishments for sin but onely fatherly and louing chastisements for the guilt and punishment of sinne vvas boren in christ now therefore if a christian be afflicted it is no punishment for then god should punish one fault twice once in christ and the second time vpon the christian which thing doth not agree with god iustice the third is that the man iustified doth merit and deserue at god hands the kingdome of heauen for being made perfectly righteous in christ and by his righteousnesse he must needs merit eternall life in and by the merit of christ inward benefits proceeding from iustification are those which are inwardly felt in the heart and serue for the better assurance of iustification and they are cheifly foure the first is peace of conscience arising from this perswasion that his sinnes are freely pardoned amp the wrath of god fully appeased by the merit and suffering of christ iesus by a liuely faith applyed the second is enterance into god fauour and a preseuerance in it vvhich is indeed a vvonderfull benefit vvhen a man that is freely pardoned and iustified in christ doth boldly approch to god presence and they are ready to aske and sue and also to obtaine any benefit that is their good the third is a spirituall ioy in their hearts euen then when they are afflicted because they looke certainly to obtaine the kingdome of heauen the fourth is that the loue of god is shed in the hearts of the faithfull by the holy ghost that is that the holy ghost doth make the faithfull very euidently feele the loue of god towards them and doth as it were fill their hearts with it in whomsoeuer these singular benefits are thus to be found there is euer to be found assuredly that the spirit of god dwelleth in them and in that the spirit of god dwelleth in them it imports not onely a familiar presence but also a continuance thereof hee dwels not for a month as a guest for a night but for euer how euer by temporall distractions he humble vs yet shall he neuer depart from that soule vvhich once hee hath sanctified to be his owne habitation and this comfort is confirmed to vs by three sure arguments the first is taken from the nature of god hee is faithfull saith the apostle by whom we are called to the fellowship of his son who will conserue vs to the end and againe saith he i am perswaded that hee which hath begun his good worke in you will performe it vntill the day of christ the second argument is taken from the nature of that life which christ communicateth to his members it is no more subiect to death we know that christ raised from the dead dye no more this life is communicated to vs for it is not wee that liue but christ that liues in vs the third is taken from the nature of that seed whereof wee are begotten for as the seede is so is the life that comes of it now the seed saith the apostle is immortall wee are borne anew not of mortall seed but immortall our life therefore is immortall as the first greatest question in religion is concerning the sauiour of the world mat so the second is concerning them who are to be saued if the iudgement be referred to man euery man accompts himselfe a christian if iudgement be sought for from the lord hee giues an answere to all if any man haue not the spirit of christ the same is not his hereby euery christian may haue a notable rule how to try his owne estate for to destroy the pride of all their glory with one word who esteeme somewhat better of themselues for the priuiledge of their estate when they excell others here it is said rom if any man he speakes without exception be what thou wilt beside neuer so noble neuer so rich neuer so learned if thou hast not the spirit of christ thou article none of his againe we see that christ and his spirit cannot be sundred let no man say hee hath christ except he haue the spirit of christ hee is not a man who hath not a soule so hee is not a christian who hath not the spirit of christ john and as christ and his spirit cannot be sundred so cannot the spirit be sundred from the fruits of the spirit now the fruits of the spirit are loue ioy peace long suffering gentlenesse goodnesse faith meekenesse temperance if the spirit of christ dwell in vs and if we liue in the spirit let vs walke in the spirit and this may be a conuiction to carnall professors that while they say the spirit of christ is in them they declare none of his fruits in their liues and conuersations we are to know that the operations of the spirit are two fold the one is general and the common operation which hee hath in the wicked for hee illuminates euery one that commeth into the world that caiaphas and saul can prophesie and iudas can preach it is from him this way hee worketh in the wicked not for any good to them but for advancement of his owne worke the other kind of the holy ghosts operation is speciall amp proper to the godly by which he doth not onely illuminate their mindes but proceedes also to their hearts and workes this three fold effect in it sanctification intercession amp consolation first he is vnto them a spirit of sanctification renewing their hearts by his effectuall grace he first rebukes them of sinne awakes their consciences by the sight thereof and giues them a sence of that wrath which sinne hath deserued whereof arises heauines of heart sadnesse in their countenance lamentation in their speech amp such an alteration in their vvhole behauiour that their former pleasure becomes painefull vnto them and others who knew them before wonder to see such a change in them from this he leades them to a sight of god mercy in christ he inflames their hearts vvith an hunger and thirst for that mercy and workes in their hearts such a loue of righteousnesse and hatred of sinne that now they become more affrayd of the occasions of sinne then they were before of sinne it selfe this resistance of sinne and care to auoid the occasions of sin are vndoubted testimonies that christ dwels in vs this is the first operation of the spirit but it is not all he proceedes further by degrees for the kingdome of god is as if a man should cast seed into the earth which growes vp hee cannot tell how first it sends forth the blade secondly the eares amp then the corne so proceeds the kingdom of god in man by degrees in the second place the holy spirit becomes a spirit of intercession so long as we are bound with the cord of our transgression we cannot pray but when hee looseth vs from our sinnes hee openeth our mouth to god hee teacheth vs to pray not onely with sighes and fobs which cannot bee expressed but also puts words in our mouthes such as wee our selues who speaks them are not able to repeate them againe and thirdly he becomes vnto them the spirit of consolation if he be vnto thee a sanctifier and intercessor he shall not faile at last to be thy comforter if at first after thou hast sent vp supplications thou finde not his consolation descending vpon thee be not discouraged but be more humbled for our sin shortens his arme and the hardnes of heart holds out his comforts wee must fall downe with mary and lye still washing the feete of christ with our teares before he takes vs vp in his armes to kisse vs and if wee finde these effects of his grace going before the humiliation of the heart amp the grace of prayer we may be out of doubt that this consolation shall follow after by this it is euident that he that hath the spirit of iesus knowes that hee hath him and herein consisteth the chiefe glory of a christian that he hath such a guest to abide with him for euer whereby vnspeakeable blessings are vouchsafed vnto him first where this holy spirit comes to dwell he repayres the lodging man by nature being like to a ruinated pallace is restored by the grace of christ as to the soule the lord stirres vp new lights in the minde restores life to the heart communicates holinesse to the affections so that vvhereas before the soule vvas an habitation for vncleane spirits that is defiled with all sorts of vilde and vncleane affections the lord iesus hath sanctified it to be a holy habitation to himselfe the body is repayred partly vvhen the members thereof are made weapons of righteousnes in this life and partly in deliuering them from mortality vvhich shalbe done in the resurrection againe by his dwelling in vs we haue the benefit of prouision hee vvill neuer suffer vs to vvant any thing that shalbe good for vs he is not burthenable after the manner of earthly kings but his reward is with him we may further consider those excellent benefits that vvee haue by the spirit of christ dwelling in vs first hee giues life to the soule and makes it to liue the life of christ gal secondly when soule and body are sandred by death he leades the soule to liue with him in glory and thirdly he casts not off the care of the body but preserueth the very dust and ashes thereof till the day of the resurrection o what a kindnesse is it that the lord will honour the dead bodyes of his children surely there was neuer a house so well paid for in the world o how happy is he who hath such a guest to dwell with him vvhat recompence hast thou to looke for he dwells with thee on earth thou shalt dwell with him in heauen he a few yeeres with thee thou with him for euer the second maine benefit arising from our vnion with christ is adoption whereby they which are iustified are also accounted of god as his owne children from adoption proceeds many other benefits first the elect childe of god is hereby made a brother of christ secondly he is a king amp the kingdome of heauen is his inheritance thirdly hee is lord ouer all creatures saue angels fourthly the holy angels minister vnto him for his good fiftly all things yes grieuous afflictions amp sin it selfe turne to his good though in it owne nature it be neuer so hurtfull and lastly being thus adopted hee may looke for comfort at god hands answerable to the measure of his afflictions as god hath promised the inward assurance of adoption is by two witnesses the first is our spirit which being often feeble and faint god hath giuen vs of his owne spirit to be a fellow witnesse with our spirit this testimony of the holy ghost is best discerned in the time of tryal amp at the houre of death which a reprobate cannot haue at all though indeed a man flattering himselfe and the diuell imitating the spirit of god doth vsually perswade carnall man and hipocrits that they shalbe saued but that diuellish illusion and the testimony of the spirit may be discerned by two notes the first is feruent and hearty prayer to god in the name of christ for the same spirit that testifieth vnto vs that we are the adopted children of god doth also make vs cry that is feruently with sighes and groanes pray to god now this feruent praying can the diuell giue to no hipocrite for it is the speciall worke of the spirit of god the second is they which haue this speciall testimony haue also in their hearts the same affections to god which children haue to their father namely loue feare reuerence obedience thankefulnesse and the like for they call not vpon god as vpon a terrible iudge but they cry abba that is father and these affections they haue not whom sathan deludeth with a fantasticall imagination of their saluation the third maine benefit is inward sanctification by vvhich a christian in his minde in his will and in his affections is freed from the bondage of sinne and sathan and is by little and little inabled by the spirit of christ to discerne amp approue that which is good and to walke in it now this sanctification is through the whole man in the spirit soule and mind the sanctification of the mind is the inlightning of it with the true knowledge of god word it is of two sorts eyther spirituall vnderstanding or spirituall wisedome spirituall vnderstanding is a generall conceiuing of euery thing that is to be done or not done out of god word spirituall wisedome is a speciall grace of god spirit peculiar only to the elect whereby a man is able to vnderstand out of god word what is to be done or not to be done in any particular things or action according to the circumstances of the person time and place the principall point of this wisedome is to determine of true happinesse whereunto the whole life of man ought to be directed which happinesse is the loue and fauour of god in christ to obtaine this heauenly wisedome we must be carefull of these two things first to get the feare of god into our hearts which is a reuerent awe of the heart towards god whereby a man is fearefull to offend and carefull to please god in all things amp this we shall get if we receiue the word of god with reuerence and apply it to our owne soules when we heare it trembling thereat vvhen it toucheth our consciences and humbly submitting our selues vnto it vvithout raging or repining secondly wee must close vp the eyes of our mindes that is we must deny our owne wisedome and suffer our selues in all things to be ouerruled and ordered by the written word of god to walke in the course of our liues by this heauenly vvisedome wee must in euery good action obserue these foure rules first the thing wee doe must be iust secondly the meanes of effecting it must also be iust thirdly we must keepe our selues therein within the lymits and compas of our calling fourthly we must doe the thing with an honest and vpright heart and for this purpose we must alwayes heare the word of god to tell vs what is iust the sanctification of the memory is when it can both keepe and remember that which is good amp agreeable to god will where as naturally it best remembers lewdnesse wickednesse and vanity sanctification of the conscience may be discerned by this that it checkes for the least sins before actuall repentance be performed and likewise approues our vpright walking in the whole course of our life it procures peace with god and with man so farre as it is profitable amp expedient and breedes contentment in the life in all occasions it procures cheerfulnesse in the countenance and readinesse in all our businesse it makes vs couragious in the truth and willing to defend the same it makes vs victorious in troubles and ready to yeeld vp our liues into the hands of god sanctification of the will is descerned hereby that it is so far forth freed from sin that it can will and chuse that which is good and acceptable to god and resist that which is euill it is further perceiued by our cheerefulnesse in well doing not by compulsion but of a willing minde by resisting as well the occasions as sinne it selfe and by yeelding to sinne with griefe rising by repentance out of the same sanctification of the affections are knowne by this that they are moued and inclined to that which is good to imbrace it and in that wee can more ioy or grieue for spirituall causes then carnall that they tend to the crucifying of the flesh and building forward of the new man and are not commonly affected and stirred with that which is euill vnlesse it be to eschew it amongst these sanctified affections foure especially are to be marked first zeale of god glory by which a christian is thus affected that rather then god should lose his glory hee could be contented to haue his owne soule damned as it was with moses exod and also paul the second is the feare of god without it a man cannot be vvise it is the first step to vvisedome in this feare of god their be two parts the first is a perswasion of heart that we are in god presence the second is that being in god presence we stand in awe of him which is when a man takes heed to his wayes lest he offend god the third is the hatred of sinne because it is sinne and especially of a mans owne corruptions wherewith a christian is so turmoyled that in regard of them and for no other cause he desireth to be out of this most miserable world that he may leaue to displease god the fourth is ioy of heart in consideration of the neerenesse of the terrible day of iudgement and second comming of christ in regard whereof they shall lift vp their heads because the full accomplishment of their redemption is at hand the sanctification of the body is when all the members of it are carefully kept and preserued from being meanes to execute any sinne and are made the instruments of righteousnesse for euery member is to be kept pure and holy to maintaine and keepe a true and iustifying faith by vvhich wee are vnited to christ and thereby inioy all blessings is to maintaine true religion both in life and death and for this end these rules must be remembred first we must haue in our hearts sincere loue to god in christ to his church and true religion secondly we must not onely know and beleeue that christ died for our sinnes and rose againe for our iustification but we must labour to feele the power and efficacie of his death killing sin in vs and the vertue of his resurrection raising vs vp to newnesse of life thirdly wee must not content our selues to know and professe that god is mercifull but withall we must take obseruation of his louing fauour towards vs particularly adding one obseruation to another so our hearts may be grounded in the loue of god because there is nothing that doth more euidently distinguish between the regenerate and vnregenerate man then such fruits as each of them doe vsually bring forth in their liues and conuersations i will therefore shew the vertues of the one and the vices of the other with their seuerall discriptions whereby euery man may perceiue in what estate hee stands whether the childe of god or the childe of the diuell whether in the state of grace or in the state of nature the graces of god spirit euer in some measure appearing in the childe of god effectually called iustified and sanctified are loue mercy meekenesse patience humilitie long suffering peace loue is properly an affection of the heart which bindes vs to loue god because hee hath loued vs and to doe vnto man as we would be done vnto or wherby one man is well pleased with another now our loue to god must appeare by the effects thereof first it is the nature of loue that it earnestly desires and seekes to obtaine that vvhich is beloued hereby thou shalt know whether thy affection of loue be ordered by christ or remaine as yet disordered by sathan the affection which christ hath sanctified vvill follow vpward seeking to be there where he is so carnall loue will carry miserable man captiued to the bottomles pit of hell but holy loue being as a sparkle of heauenly fire kindled in our harts by the holy ghost ascends continually towards god from whom it came not suffering vs to rest till we inioy it the second tryall of our loue is obedience and an holy care in all our callings to serue and honour the lord the third tryall of loue is bountifulnes experience proues that euery louer bestoweth bountifully on that which he loueth the fourth tryall of loue is readinesse to suffer affliction for the cause of god for the farther tryall of our loue let vs consider vvhat our sauiour christ saith math i say vnto you loue your enemy blesse them that curse you doe good to them that hate you and pray for them that hurt and persecute you the loue here commanded comprehendeth these two things first to be louingly affected in heart towards an enemie secondly to be louingly affected in speach amp action for the first loue in heart comprehendeth all good affections that one man beareth to another as mercy compassion meekenesse and desire to doe him good for the second it is set out vnto vs in three branches first blesse them that curse you vvhere is commended all good speach both vnto and of our enemy secondly doe good to them that hate you where is prescribed all louing vsage in action by affording all the helpe and comfort vvee can thirdly pray for them that persecute you that is for their good estate in this life so farre forth as it serueth for god glory and for their conuersion and saluation in the world to come for the affection of the heart take christs example who so loued his enemy that he shed his owne heart bloud for their saluation for loue in courteous speech see dauids practise towards saul his professed enemie sam and chap for doing good in action read exod if thou meete thine enemy oxe or his asse going astray thou shalt bring him home againe and pro if thy enemy be hungry giue him bread to eate if he be thirsty giue him drinke see the practise hereof in elisha when god deliuered them into his hands that did seeke his life he brought them to samaria and when the king of israell would haue slaine them he forbad him nay he caused the king to refresh them with water and bread and so sent them away to their owne master for praying for our enemy we haue the example of our sauiour the prophets and steuen vvho prayed for them that put him to death mercy is an holy compassion of the hart whereby one man is moued to help another in his misery first i call it a compassion of heart because it makes one man to put on the person of another amp to be grieued for the miserie of another as if it were his owne secondly it is called the bowels of compassion because when a mans heart is touched therewith his very lyuer and intrailes doe stirre in his body and are troubled in him thirdly this vertue of mercy moueth the heart to helpe another that is in miserie for helpe in misery is a notable fruit of true compassion neither can they be seuered for in the compassion of the heart and in the act of reliefe stands true mercy the duties of mercy are answerable to mans misery now mans miserie is eyther in soule or body the greatest miseries of man are in his soule as ignorance impenitency and trouble of conscience mans bodily miseries are sicknes thirst nakednesse and the like and to these the workes of mercy are answerable mercy towards the soule is when a man is carefull for the saluation of another vsing meanes to bring a man from spirituall darkenesse vnto light from the power of sathan to god from the estate of sinne and danger of hell fire to the state of grace in true faith amp repentance and so eternall life and looke how far the soule is more excellent then the body so farre doth this vvorke exceede any vvorke of mercy that concernes the body mercy towards the body is called almes or releefe whereby a mans outvvard necessity for foode rayment or such like is supplied hereby it may appeare who is a mercifull man namely such a one as hath his heart touched vvith compassion towards the misery of another amp thereby is moued to help and releeue him in soule and body according to his estate and such a man is blessed by the testimony of christ himselfe howsoeuer in the vvorld he may be dispised to moue vs to this duty let vs marke these things first the state of the merciful is here pronounced blessed of christ secondly mercy is a gift of the spirit and the grace of god elect vvhich alwayes accompanyeth the happy estate of those that be in christ thirdly hereby vve become like vnto god our heauenly father fourthly hereby wee are made instruments of god mercy to them that be in misery for the furtherance of vs in this so excellent a duty we must obserue certaine rules first wee must exercise three of our senses seeing hearing and feeling in other mens miseries for seeing deut we must be very wary it grieue vs not to looke vpon our poore brother but wee must see and behold his misery amp distres whether it be in soule or body this is the lord practise exod secondly if we cannot come to see a mans misery then we must be content to here of it and giue heed and credit to the true reports that others make thereof to vs this was the practise of nehemiah nehem and ch thirdly for feeling if the lord shall afflict our body with sicknes or our soules with temptations wee must be willing to suffer the same patiently that thereby wee may be fitted to take more compassion vpon others in like case and to comfort them the better this did paul and timothie secondly we must make our particular callings wherein we liue the instruments of mercy and in doing the duties thereof shew forth compassion towards others first the maiestrate must rule and gouerne in mercy secondly the minister must preach in mercy thirdly euery priuate man must make the duties of his calling workes of mercy the rich man must know himselfe to be not a lord but a steward of god blessings and therefore must imploy the same in mercy by giuing amp lending vnto the poore freely as god shall minister vnto him iust occasion the trade man must buy and sell in mercy dealing iustly with the rich and shewing liberality to the poore the maister must thus in mercy vse the labour of his servant and the servant thus in mercy doe seruice to his maister for conscience towards god and happy were it with all estates if this rule of mercy were obserued the want whereof is the bane of all societies thirdly for the more chearefull practise of mercy wee must lay aside some part of our goods for the releefe of them that be in misery many are giuen to great excesse in fare and attyre but they may doe well to abate somewhat thereof to bestow it on the poore for hereby will the rest be sanctified to their more free and comfortable vse nay in case of necessity wee ought to sequester some part of our necessaries for the refreshing of the poore so did the church of macedonia giue aboue their power to the releefe of the afflicted brother corinthian meekenesse is a gift of god spirit whereby a man doth moderate his affections of anger and bridle in himselfe impatience hatred amp desire of reuenge it is a vertue whereby a man is gentle in behauiour towards all persons both good and bad it makes a man with patience and a quiet heart to beare god iudgements and to put vp iniuries and to beare wrongs when occasion of reuenge is giuen him meekenesse is not to be shewed in the matters of god when his glory is impeached for therein we must haue zeale as hote as fire but in the wrongs and iniuries that concerne our selues moses was the meekest man on earth in his time numb and yet when the israelits had made a golden calfe exod in zeale of god glory hee brake the two tables of stone and put to sword the same day two thousand man that had so dishonoured god the like we see in dauid psalm and in our sauiour christ math the ground or cause of meekenesse is affliction and pouerty of spirit for hardly can hee be meeke and patient in spirit that hath not beene acquainted with the crosse to induce vs vnto this vertue let vs first consider christs precept and example bidding vs to learne of him for he is meeke and lowly againe consider god own dealing with vs we daily wrong him with our offences and yet he beares with vs lastly the fruition and practise of this grace hath the promise of blessednes belonging to it and therefore as we vvould be happy so we must get into our hearts the spirit of meekenesse and expresse the vertue and power thereof in our liues patience is a voluntary and continuall suffering for the loue of vertue and honesty and therefore whatsoeuer hapneth a wise man by this vertue he is prepared to digest amp turne it to the best or othervvise it is a grace of the spirit flowing from grace and hope whereby we so suffer things that are euill that we forsake not those things that are good by which we may attayne to those that are better amongst all the graces of god spirit this prayse may be giuen to patience that it is the keeper of the rest if our patience be not first broken vvee cannot be induced to the committing of any sinne sinnefull concupiscence proceeds from the impatience of continence couetousnesse from this that wee are impatient of our sober estate it is the will of god that through manifold afflictions wee should enter into the kingdome of heauen and therefore when any crosse befals vs walking in our lawful callings we must indeuour to subiect our selues patiently to the vvill of god in prosperity we are cherefull and thankefull but vvhen affliction comes our nature vvill repine o remember vvee say in all estates thy will be done and therefore in the most bitter crosses that can befall vs we must labour to say with iob the lord giueth and the lord taketh blessed be the name of the lord the practise whereof we see in dauid sam touching shimei long suffering is a vertue whereby a man doth beare with other mens wants as morositie and hastines and in bearing yeelds for the maintenance of peace thus dealt abraham with lot when their herdsmen were at variance though hee were the superiour both for age and place yet for peace sake hee put lot to choose the place of his abode whether on the right hand or left humilitie is a vertue whereby one man thinkes better of another then of himselfe for this makes a man thinke basely of himselfe in regard of his owne sinnes and corruptions whereupon he is contented to giue place vnto others and to yeeld of his owne right for the maintenance of peace when as on the other side pride causeth man to seeke for more then their due amp so causeth contention peace is a vertue whereby wee haue vnitie and concord with god and one with another now peace is two folde good or euill good peace is that which standeth with a good conscience and true religion euill peace is an agreement and concord in euill as in the praise of any sin against god commandements and is such as cannot stand with true religion and good conscience the good peace is three folde peace with god with our selues and our christian brother this peace hath sixe heads first peace betweene man and god which is properly called reconcilation whereby god in ghrist is at one with man and man through christ is at one with god of which when a man is once perswaded in his heart then comes this peace secondly peace vvith the good angels for man being at peace vvith god then angels become servant and ministring spirits vnto them thirdly peace with a mans selfe consisting of two things first when the conscience sanctified ceaseth to accuse and assurance of god fauour beginneth to take his part to excuse and speake for him before god secondly when the will affection amp inclinations subiect themselues to the enlightened minde of which if eyther be wanting man is at war with himselfe amp the peace of god ruleth not in his heart fourthly peace of true beleeuers amongst themselues who before they beleeue vvere as lyons and cockatrises but now in the kingdome of christ haue put off that savage nature and become peaceable fiftly peace of the faithfull vvith professed enemy namely vvhen they indeauour to haue peace with all man sixtly concord of the enemy themselues with the true church for often the lord restraineth the mallice of his enemy and inclines them to peace the way to get and keepe true peace for euer is this first vvee must call vpon god for the pardon of our sinnes euery day secondly we must follow after peace vvith man in the practice of forgiuenesse and reconciliation vvhen offences grow for when we are at one with god and man vve haue a blessed peace and hence will follow peace in our owne hearts vvhich is that peace vvhich the world cannot giue which while wee retaine we need not feare any euill no not death it selfe for if god be with vs who can be against vs there are many other vertues propounded in the scriptures which might here be discribed but these may be sufficient to declare in whom the spirit of christ dwelleth for where christ dwelleth by his spirit there are euer the fruits of the spirit perceiued for the spirit and the effects thereof cannot be sundred for euery thing bringeth forth that vvhich is of his owne nature fire sendeth forth nothing but heate the fountaine nothing but cleere water and the like now that these vertues may the more apparently shew themselues to bee the fruits and effects of the spirit in the regenerate man i will therefore set downe and discribe such vices as commonly shew forth themselues in the wicked and are the fruits and effects of the vnregenerate for hereby the childe of god renewed by grace and the vnregenerate remayning in the state of nature may as easily be distinguished as white from blacke being layd together i will first begin with pride because as one saith it may well stand in the forefront since it is a maister diuell and the very bane of the soule pride is said to be the timpany of the soule because it is a puffing vp of the heart and minde proceeding from the opinion of some good thing in vs more then in others his companions are envy anger impatience indignation selfe will and obstinacy pride is full of enuy because the proud man thinketh himselfe onely the worthiest and that euery mans greatnes is a hinderance to his it is full of anger supposing himselfe neuer so wel thought of as he deserues full of impatience in that he will not suffer himselfe to be reproued but will haue his vices accounted vertues amp lookes to be commended for them full of indignation esteeming euery man vnworthy of any good that befalles him in comparison of himselfe full of obstinacie by stifly holding his owne opinion notwithstanding any proofe alledged to the contrary this sinne of pride of all other is the most dangerous because other sinnes proceede from euill deedes but pride is to be feared euen in good and vertuous actions of pride their are nine branches presumption obstinacy hipocrisie boasting ingratitude contempt disobedience ambition and curiosity pride if we consider the cause thereof is momentary and very vncertaine for if it proceede from riches who knowes not that they may be lost in a moment if from nobility or great birth it may be stayned if from knowledge it is full of error if from strength it may soone decay if from honour it is but a ceremony if from beauty age may wrinckle it if from good successe time may alter it if from dainty foode it may breed surfetting vvhich commonly bringeth death if from clothing what is it but skinnes and wooll nay the very excrements of bruit beast and stones of the earth if from health sicknesse may destroy it if from multitude of friends are they not like to vvater brookes that in summer become dry and in winter frozen if from sharpnesse of wit there is no man liuing but is guilty of folly the onely and chiefe remedy against pride is humilitie for as by pride vve are banished from the presence of god so by humilitie we are recalled to him againe because without humility no other vertue vvhatsoeuer is acceptable in his sight the second maine and capitall sinne is couetousnesse which we may call the dropsie of the soule because the couetous man the more he hath the more still he desireth it is also a kinde of bad motion whereby the diuel intiseth vs vnlawfully to withholde our owne goods or vniustly to couet other mens of this sinne there are foure sorts the first is to desire that vvhich is another mans not caring how we get it by right or wrong the second is when vve study to get money wealth or fauour by wicked means the third is vvhen vve will not restore that which vve know to be another mans the fourth is when we treasure vp much vvealth and neither vse it our selues nor imploy it to the benefit and reliefe of others this viper hath nine heads by which it snatcheth at the trash of the vvorld fraud vnquietnes periury bribes sacriledge theft vsury rapine and simony consider that the matter thereof which is riches is most vild and abiect or else our sauiour would neuer haue committed the purse to iudas christ chose not his apostles and best beloued from amongst princes but poore fishermen that no man can serue two masters god and the world no more then hee can at one time behold heauen and earth that riches for the most part are gotten with paine preserued vvith feare and lost with sorrow that the couetous or most wealthiest man is but as the mill wheele which though it turne all day about yet at night is found where it vvas in the morning so howsoeuer we runne about this world for wealth yet at our death we shal be found as poore as wee were at our birth that the couetous man are but as camels that all day carry the kings treasure and at night are turned into a filthy stable being able to shew no signe or appearance thereof but their galde backes the onely remedy against couetousnesse is liberalitie which is a distribution of those good things that are in our possession to the benefit of others for we haue nothing which wee haue not receiued from god who hath giuen them for the good of others and will require an accompt thereof at our hands the third capitall sinne is luxurie which may be called the leprosie of the soule and is an inordinate appetite of lasciuious and fleshly pleasures there are sixe kindes of this sinne the first is fornication which is an unlawful societie of one single person with an other the second is rape or rauishment when a virgin is deflowred either with her consent or against her will for although it be with her consent yet it is counted rauishment in respect of the haynousnesse thereof by reason it violently breakes the lists of chastitie and opens a gap many times to further vncleannesse a third is adultery when the maried body is defiled and this is of two sorts either simple as when the maried sinnes with the vnmaried or double when the maryed sinnes with the maried the fourth is incest when the abuse of fleshly lust is committed by such as are of one kindred bloud or affinitie which sinne makes man of the nature of bruit beast the fift is sodomie which is of two sorts when man iusteth after man or man after beast this is a crying sinne calling for vengeance vpon the offenders the sixt is excesse of carnall action euen amongst the maried which although it seeme lawful yet it offends god if it exceed measure or modesty there are nine fore runners of this sin voluptuous eating scurrulous talke a discouered dug a naked breast frizled hayre artificiall paynting costly perfumes a rowling eye an vnchaste foote consider that the obiect whereto it tendeth which is the corporall fruition of vnchaste persons is though candyed with a faire out side inwardly the receptacle of vilde and corruptible basenesse that lust is neuer satisfied but alwayes poore euen in plenty that the pleasure thereof is momentany the punishment eternall that it defileth the temple of the holy ghost which is mans body consecrated vnto christ by his precious bloud that it is no sooner inioyed but it breeds annoy that it weakens the powers of the soule and fils the body vvith many diseases that it shorteneth the life and shadoweth good report that it is a fire whose substance is gluttony whose flame is pride whose sparkles are corrupt speeches vvhose ashes filthines and whose end is hell the best remedy against luxury is chastity which is of foure sorts either of nature as of such as are borne chast or by article as such as are made chast by man or by prayer and industry as of such as haue made themselues chast for the kingdome of heauen or by marriage as of such as liue chastly in wedlocke enuy the fourth capitall sinne may be said to be the canker of the soule for that it eates and frets into the inward man no otherwise then rust doth into iron it is a reioycing at another mans hurt and sorrowing at his good it is of two sorts good and bad good enuy is that when beholding the perfections of another we are angry with our owne imperfections and labour seriously to be equall or at least to imitate the good qualities which we see to flourish more in others then in our selues this is called emulation bad enuy is when we grieue that the like good qualities are not in vs or not as vvell in vs as in another and of this there are fiue branches detraction discord murmuring hatred hurt consider that enuy is the bagge and cognisance of the diuell for the diuell is not better knowne then by his enuious disposition and therefore such as giue place in their harts to this vice are said to be the servant of the diuell if servant of the diuell they are enemy to god if enemy to god they become subiect to eternall damnation of all other sinnes it is accounted the iustest for that it taketh vengeance vpon it selfe for although it euer leuels the dart of mischiefe against others yet it vvounds it selfe and is to the heart of man as the vvorme bred in the tree to the wood thereof by whom at last it is deuoured but say it were pleasing and plausible in it selfe yet consider god will be reuenged vpon it as by the example of caine his envy towards abel saul towards dauid haman towards mordechay it is to be loathed and abhorred but being so that it consumeth the heart dryeth vp the body vexeth the minde and indangereth the soule what can be thought more detestable the remedy against envy is charity or loue to doe vnto others as we vvould be done vnto gluttony the fift capitall sinne may be called the deluge or inundation of the soule because it is a rauenous desire to see amp fill the stomacke beyond the rule or bonds of nature amp there are two sorts of it the first consisteth in greedy often amp immoderate desire of delicate meates and variety of dishes the second is when instead of refreshing the body vvith sufficient moysture we drowne it in the superfluity of drink of this sinne there are eleuen dangerous effects the first is dulnesse of wit whereby we are made vnfit for any duty of good christians the second is impotencie vvhen through gluttony our body are infected with many diseases the third is scurrility which is an impudent behauiour of the body whereby we prouoke man to laugh vs to scorne the fourth is fury when through this ill disposition of excesse we spurne at reason amp good counsell the fift is superfluous talke when through the force of wine we vomit out detractions cursings and horrible oathes and blasphemies filthy idle amp vnchast words the sixt is drousinesse when vve are fit for nothing but sleepe the seuenth is beastly nastines when our surcharging stomackes bewrayes our intemperance by vomiting belching amp stinking of the breath the eight is lust for belly cheere and drunkennesse are the bellowes to concupiscence the ninth is pouerty when for abusing of plenty we are plagued and pinched with penury the tenth is the losse of credit amp estimation in the world the eleuenth and last is the wrath and indignation of god whom of a mercifull and louing father vve make a rigorous and punishing iudge besides the reasons before mentioned there are eight other circumstances inducing vs to the detestation of it first it hasteneth the desolation of the body secondly it taketh part with the flesh in the combat betweene it and the spirit thirdly it inureth the body to an euill custome fourthly it playes the hipocrite with vs appearing sweet and pleasant at the first but in the end it byteth like a scorpion fiftly it liues continually vnder the curse of god sixtly it destroyeth the sence seuenthly to be subiect to the desire of the belly is a perpetuall slauery eightly because of the iudgements of god inflicted vpon offenders in his kinde to auoyd gluttony we must imbrace temperance and sobriety which consisteth in chastning and taming the body by fasting and abstinence the sixt capitall sinne is wrath which may be called the frensie of the soule and is defined to be a vehement motion of the heart tending to reuenge whereby the blood boyling exceedingly sendeth vp hot and burning vapours to the braine so that reason is smothered and the will made obedient to the affections of this sin there are eleauen branches malice fury impatience malediction blasphemy reproch reuenge contention threatning crueltie and murther the meanes whereby wee are taught to detest wrath and anger are these first the example of bruite beastes though neuer so fierce will alwayes shew themselues meeke and gentle to them of the same kinde the lyon will not hurt the lyon nor the dragon the dragon secondly in that wee are brought forth naked and vnarmed signifies we ought to loath crueltie thirdly to remember what christ hath done for vs amp to think that if we expect mercy at his hands wee ought to shew mercy to others fourthly so long as wee continue in wrath all our actions are abhominable to god fiftly the wrathfull man liues in a continuall purgatory and hell of conscience lastly wee must not let the sun goe downe vpon our wrath anger or wrath is to be auoyded two manner of wayes first in respect of others secondly in respect of our selues we shall the sooner auoid the wrath of another man if eyther wee giue place to his fury or staying by him vse milde and gentle speeches the best way to auoid anger in our selues is patience in suffering of euill with a quiet minde thinking whatsoeuer is laid vpon vs in this life whether affliction persecution or the like yet nothing can touch our soule and therefore not to be regarded of vs besides to bridle anger consider the party with whom we are displeased if it be a stranger impute it to his ignorance if a childe to his folly if a master or father to his authoritie if a wife to her loue if a friend to his care if a brother to his boldnesse if a servant to his negligence if a neighbour to his rashnesse no doubt vpon better consideration they will repent them of their ouer sight idlenesse or sloth the seauenth capitall sinne may be called the lethargie of the soule being a lazy deiecture of the whole man from the laudable exercise of vertue for that in a manner hee becomes sencelesse but in truth altogether vnprofitable of this sinne there are eleauen branches protraction remissenes negligence improuidence indeuotion sluggishnesse persillanimitie irresolution desperation misprision and omission remember that sloth is a vice which impouerisheth both soule and body the soule of naturall graces the body of externall goods remember likewise it captiuates and brings vs vnder the slauish tiranny of our worldly and spirituall enemy remember it is the root amp nest of many other vices as by the example of dauid who no sooner gaue himselfe to rest after his painefull war but he fell into the sinnes of adultery and murther remember it is a vice that the very bruite beast abhorre as may be seene by the bee the ant and other small contemptible creatures lastly consider all other creatures not hauing life are so opposite to sloth as they continually keepe their first course in which they were created without intermission vn vnlesse it be vpon some violent and accidentall cause as we may see by the sun moone and starres by the ebbing and flowing of the sea and by the iust returne of summer and winter spring and autumne and the like consider that we enter into this world as it were to runne a race if therefore wee runne not so as wee may get the goale wee lose the reward the best remedy therefore against sloath and idlenesse is deuotion which is a ready and willing performance of the seruice of god and of all other duties required of vs in this life the off spring or branches proceeding from these seauen master sinnes are seuerally described in a booke called two guides of a good life wherein you may see and learne how to auoid sinne and follow vertue to delight in the one and to detest the other if you should not aske me hauing shewed how to detest and auoid some sinnes in particular what sinne is and the reward thereof as also how to auoid sin in generall ile tell you briefly what i haue learned from the mouth of a right worthy instrument in the church of god sinne is euery breach of the law of god if it be no more but the least omission of what the law requireth and the punishment thereof is plagues in this life death in the end of this life and eternall damnation after this life s iames chap verse saith resist the diuell and hee will flye from thee in vvhich wordes is both a precept and a promise in the precept is two things to be considered the action and the obiect the action is to resist the obiect is the diuell for the performance of this action three things are requisite first a preparation before the combat secondly how vve are to demeane our selues in the combat thirdly how to carry our selues after the combat first for the preparation obserue these rules set downe in the sixt chapter of the ephesians from the to the verses which weapons there prescribed are both defensiue and offensiue those defensiue are fiue first for this combat wee must stand fast hauing our loynes girt about with veritie which is to be grounded in the setled truth of god word without vnconstancy secondly vve must put on the brest plate of righteousnesse which is a setled purpose not to displease god in any thing though neuer so seeming good in it selfe thirdly wee must haue our feet shod with preparation of the gospell of peace which is a constant resolution to professe the truth euen vnto death yes if it should procure the losse of life goods vvife children and all fourthly aboue all to take the shield of faith which is such a faith as vvholy relieth on god in christ with particular application which will quench the fiery darts of the wicked fiftly to take the helmet of saluation which is to stand assured that our saluation is sealed vp vnto vs which assurance vvill cause vs with confidence to withstand all sathans assaults vvhatsoeuer sixtly we must get the sword of the spirit which is an offensiue weapon which is the word of god wherewith our head and captaine christ repeld the diuell seuenthly and lastly that we pray with all maner prayer and supplication in the spirit and watch thereunto with all perseuerance which two vveapons being added to the rest are of force to strike through the very heart of the diuell the second thing to be obserued is the manner how vve must behaue our selues in this combat and herein obserue these rules first kill sinne in the very conception for it is like a canker which groweth not to ripenesse but by degrees otherwise it vvill grow from motion to liking from liking to consent from consent to action from action to custom from custom to hardnesse of heart and from hardnesse of heart to the height of all sinnes if the serpent once get in his head he will afterwards wring in all his body timothy giueth warning to take heed of couetousnesse vvhich being once entertayned giueth vvay to many noysome temptations ahab desiring nabaoths vineyard no sooner imbraced that euill motion but presenting it vvith a further desire brought forth fearefull and euill effects that man that vvill first vvalke in the counsell of the vngodly will next stand in the way of sinners and lastly will sit in the seate of the scornefull iudas was first a cunning dissembler secondly a secret theefe thirdly an impundent lyer fourthly a bloody traytor and lastly a desperate reprobate peter first denied christ faintly secondly with an oath thirdly vvith cursing and swearing wherefore kill sinne in the conception secondly be sure to put no confidence in thy owne strength for thereby peter fell grieuously thirdly beleeue not the diuell although hee bring truth in his mouth our sauiour christ could not abide the diuell to speake the truth in the mayd hauing a spirit of diuination fourthly be carefull euer to make resistance vnto it and this is performed either by weakening the abilitie of sin or els by opposing his contrary vnto sinne first to weaken the ability of sinne is by taking away all occasions to sinne and by remouing all the sustainements thereof and also making a holy couenant with euery member of our body and soules euer to repell it neuer to admit it by vvhich meanes sinne may come to be as a lake into which the current of no streame runneth which must needes be dryed vp secondly it is done by opposing his contraries vnto sinnes as charity to melice temperance and sobriety to gluttony and drunkennesse liberalitie to niggardice vigilance to security confidence to distrust faith to infidelity truth to lying chastity to intemperance and so of the rest the practise of one particular was in ioseph with potifars wife how saith he shall i commit this euill and sinne against god fiftly that thou be carefull neuer to compare the paine of resistance with the pleasure of the sin for sin is sweet in committing but rather compare the horror and gripings of the conscience with the paine of resistance which will be a good meanes to keepe thee from sinne sixtly be assured that if once thou giue the diuell the foyle he will be afterwards lesse able to assault thee amp thou more able to resist him and that with more courage seuenthly amp lastly thou must be carefull and diligent to finde out the subtiltie deuices and sleights of the diuell by which he doth assault thee very cunningly for he hath a neare coniecture vnto what sins thou article most inclined by nature and accordingly he fits his temptations if thou be inclined to couetousnes he will offer thee naboths vineyard and rather then faile he will plot meanes to slay him so thou may effect thy desire if vaine glorious he will make thee thirst after the life of poore mordecay if ambitious he will stirre vp meanes to driue dauid out of his kingdome that absolon may enioy it amp thus he fitteth his temptations to mens naturall inclinations amp thus much of the second place namely how we should behaue our selues in the combate when we are grappling hand to hand with the diuell the third and last thing to be considered is what wee are to doe after the combate and that is presently to prepare our selues for a new combat for if wee shall consider the malice of the diuell how he euer seeketh our subuersion and ouer throw and hauing once taken the foile yet is not at rest but by other meanes seeketh againe to assault vs for so he did with our head and captaine christ iesus three seueral times one after another it should in this case teach vs to take heed of carelesse securitie as not to thinke our selues safe when wee haue giuen the diuell the foyle but euer to stand vpon our guard for if hee dealt thus with christ our head vvhat vvill hee doe with the members which being conscionably and carefully regarded we may then expect an happy issue which is that the diuell will flye from vs whereby we may obserue and note god especiall care ouer vs who euer giues a happy issue with the temptation to those that vvalke in holy obedience before him and if we would alwayes in temptations call to minde god goodnesse his mercy and kindnesse formerly bestowed vpon vs it would be as a bulwark of defence against the temptations of the diuell this did ioseph when he was tempted to filthinesse by his mistresse gen hee instantly considered how god had exalted him to great honour making him chiefe of his masters house and ruler ouer all how saith he shall i commit this euill and sinne against my god by this that hath beene said we may learne how to auoid sinne as also to repell the diuell which if through the blessing of god vpon our carefull endeuour through the vse of the meanes we shall in some measure attaine vnto yet wee are not to thinke vvee haue done enough and there to rest but wee must labour and endeuour to doe good and to bring forth fruits vvorthy amendement of life for euery tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewen downe and cast into the fire it is not said euery tree that bringeth forth euill fruit or that bringeth forth no fruit but that bringeth not forth good fruit now what those fruits are vvhich the trees of righteousnesse doe vsually beare hath beene formerly declared now because vvee may bring forth such fruit as in themselues may seeme to be good yet for want of knowledge fayling in the manner of doing of them they are displeasing and dishonourable to the lord know that in euery action pleasing and acceptable to the lord in the doing thereof these fiue rules are to be obserued first the person of him must be pleasing to the lord who performes any action to him before abels sacrifice vvas accepted his person vvas accepted it may be demaunded how we shall know when our persons are pleasing vnto god consider by nature we are enemy vnto him and so long our persons cannot please him as we be not of christ therefore finde thy selfe to be in christ and then thou article acceptable vnto god for god sayth this is my beloued son in whom i am well pleased looke how christ is vnto god so is euery one being in christ if then thou would know whether thou be in christ looke to thy faith whether it be a iustifying faith secondly thou must haue the word of god for thy warrant being sure that the action thou doest be such as his word alloweth thirdly the end of the action must be intended to the glory of god fourthly it must be done in loue which respecteth the good of others amp lastly it must be done within the compasse of our callings it is not lawful for one to doe that which another may euery man may not preach nor euery man may not gouerne therefore content thy selfe with thy calling and know what the duties are that god requireth of thee within the limits and bounds thereof if these be wanting either faith the word the end or loue or out of our calling the action though neuer so seeming good cannot please god if any shall looke backe to that which hath beene sayd and considereth the estate of the regenerate and vnregenerate man as also thereby beholdeth his owne present estate and cannot finde in himselfe faith and the graces of god spirit so apparant as hath beene shewed and so doubteth whether he be the child of god or not remembring the zeale of moses the faith of dauid the repentance of peter as also finding in himselfe that hee can power forth teares more abundantly for a temporary losse as of vvife children friends goods and the like then for committing many grieuous sins whereby god is dishonoured and himselfe in danger to incurre the losse of his fauour for euer and heerevpon remembring that nothing should be more deare vnto him then the honour of god nothing more precious and delightfull then his word his sacraments and sabbaths wherein as yet he seeth in himselfe but small delight and doubteth of his own saluation therefore yet know this for thy comfort and be assured that to doubt of faith is a testimony of faith for he that neuer doubted neuer beleeued and although thou hast not the zeale of moses the faith of dauid the repentance of peter inso full a measure as they had consider they had a great measure of god spirit and accordingly the graces thereof appeared in them for god requireth according to the grace giuen and although thou hast not these appearing in thee yet if thou doest vnfaynedly desire them and labourest in the vse of the meanes to attaine them thou hast them all in some measure and they are true in thee the scruple of gold may be perfect gold as well as the whole wedge so faith though but as a scruple may be true faith as vvell as the greatest measure and whereas thou doubtest of thy saluation in that thou canst more grieue for a temporary losse then for the committing of some sinne whereby thou mayst loose god fauour consider to the one thou hast both nature and grace to help thee but to the other grace onely if then thou findest not this great measure of grace in thee be not discouraged for if any man haue a desire to obey god in all his commandements he hath the spirit and he who hath the spirit is in christ and hee who is in christ shall neuer see damnation and though he faile greatly in the action of obedience yet god will accept his affection to obay as obedience acceptable vnto him and will approue of thee for his owne worke which he hath wrought in thee and not reiect thee for thine so be it he may haue a measure of knowledge of the true god and of his workes and gouerning the world also of the trinitie and that iesus christ dyed for the sinnes of mankinde which knowledge euen the pagan had yes euen so as few christians attaine vnto so great knowledge and yet hee may be damned if he goe no further for sathan knoweth all this better then any man being a spirit and hauing the knowledge of angels and of the scriptures also the reprobates haue the like knowledge hee may not onely know these things before named but also confesse them publikely and beleeue them to be true also he may be able to talke and dispute of any point of diuinitie very cunningly and be so great a maintainer of it that he may be a publike preacher yet if he goe no further he may be damned for the diuell beleeueth and publikely confesseth christ agrippa also beleeued all these things also iudas was a preacher and worker of miracles so shall many reprobates thirdly hee may come to the hearing of god word preached which few of the world commonly doe or will doe yes he may receiue the word and that gladly not scorning of it or thinking hardly of it or of the preachers but the cursed ground did so so herod also heard john baptist fourthly at the preaching of god word hee may be so wonderfully affected that hee may tremble againe which most man neuer come vnto desiring to heare it as a tale or for newes or for bare knowledge but euen this did cursed felix and agrippa cryed out that hee was almost perswaded to be a christian both reprobates hee may haue a knowledge of his grieuous sinnes and a feeling of them and complaine of them to be great and grieuous but so did damned caine after hee hath committed sinne he may be very sory and troubled before he commit a sinne amp vse all meanes not to doe it which few christians doe committing sinne without remorse yet if he goe no further he may be damned for wicked pilate did this striuing to set christ free and pleading for him also herod being to behead john baptist after he hath committed a sinne he may be very sory for it yes mourne and make satisfaction yet if he goe no further he may be damned for achab did this mourning and fasting and iudas also who was so sory that he hanged himselfe and made satisfaction he may be accounted so glorious a member of the visible church as the best minister may haue nothing to say against him yes hee may make such a good confession of his faith as he may be partaker of the sacraments yet a reprobate for iudas was such a one and simon magus he may leade such a godly outward life that the true children of god may thinke him so good as themselues he may reuerently vse all holy and diuine exercises he may make much of preachers he may shew great zeale at the beginning yet a reprobate for iudas was so thought of by the apostles he vsed all holy exercises with the apostles and our sauiour herod made much of john baptist iehu was zealous at the beginning he may not onely pray publikely at the church which most man doe for fashion feare shame or company but also alone between god amp himselfe which few doe and god may heare his prayers also he may desire the godly to pray for him if he goe no further he is but a reprobate for the pharises went alone to the temple to pray also god heard achab pharao desired moses to pray for him also simon magus peter he may thinke in his owne heart that he is a very good christian and beloued of god and thanke god for it and excell in the vvorkes of a christian mooue himselfe to thanke god vse prayer fasting almes and vpright dealing with all man and yet may be damned if hee goe no further for the pharises had all these whom if our righteousnes exceed not we shall not enter into the kingdome of heauen after all this godly life led lying on his death bed he may often remember god amp call vpon him he may talke of the ioyes of heauen and thinke them happy that be there and wish himselfe there yes he may dye like a lambe and yet for all this be a damned creature for many shall say lord lord and yet not enter into the kingdome of heauen and assuredly they neuer sayd it oftner then when they were sicke and the foolish virgin desired to enter in vvith christ and yet were shut out feare therefore and tremble till you stride the thirteenth step the thirteenth step without the vvhich no man can enter into heauen and be saued is true repentance which whosoeuer hath not is yet no true christian and that is a true and vnfained turning of the heart amp soule vnto the lord god from all our sinnes and is caused in vs by the fearefull sight of god iudgement hanging ouer our heads moouing vs to lament our sinnes from our hearts bitterly hauing a stedfast faith in the mercies of christ iesus applying them to our selues for our agreement vvith god and leading a godly life according to god commandements till our death vvhich true repentance vvhen it is in any hath the seauen properties which are before spoken of

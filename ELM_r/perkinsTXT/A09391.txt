the government of the tongue is a vertue pertaining to the holy usage of the tongue according to god worde and for the well ordering of it two things are requisite a pure heart and skill in the language of canaan the pure heart is most necessarie because it is the fountaine of speech and if the fountaine be defiled the streames that issue thence can not be cleane and because the heart of man by nature is a bottomlesse gulfe of iniquitie two things are to be knowen first howe it must be made pure and then howe it is alwayes afterwarde to be kept pure the way to get a pure heart is this first thou must seriously examine thy life and thy conscience for all thy sinnes past then with a heavie and bleeding heart confesse them to god utterly condemning thy selfe thirdly with deepe sighes and grones of spirite crye unto heauen to god the father in the name of christ for pardon i say for pardon of the same sinnes as it were for life and death and that day and night till the lord send downe from heauen a sweete certificate into the perplexed conscience by his holy spirite that all thy sinnes are done away nowe at the same instant in which pardon shall be graunted god likewise will once againe stretch forth that mightie hand of his whereby he made thee when thou wast not to make thee a newe creature to create a newe heart in thee to renewe a right spirite in thee and to stablish thee by his free spirite for whome he justifieth them also at the same time he sanctifieth the purified heart appeareth by these signes i if thou feele thy selfe to be displeased at thine owne infirmities and corruptions and to droupe under them as man doe under bodily sicknesse ii if thou beginne to hate and to flie thine owne personall sinnes iii if thou feele a griefe and sorow after that thou hast offended god iiii if thou heartily desire to abstaine from all manner of sinne v if thou be carefull to auoid all occasions and intisements to euill vi if thou trauell and doe thine indeauour in euery good thing vii if thou desire and pray to god to wash and rinse thine heart in the blood of christ when the heart is pure to keep it so is the speciall worke of faith which purifieth the heart faith purifieth the heart by a particular applying of christ crucified with all his merites kin elisha when hee went up and lay upon the dead childe and put his mouth on his mouth and his eyes upon his eies and his hands vpon his hands and stretched him selfe upon him the flesh of the childe waxed warme afterward elisha rose and spread him selfe upon him the second time then the child neesed seaven times and opened his eies so must a man by faith even spread himselfe upon the crosse of christ applying hands and feete to his pearced hands and his feet and his wretched heart to christes bleeding heart and then hee shall feele him selfe warmed by the heat of god spirite and sinne from daie to daie crucified with christ and his dead heart quickened and reviued and this applying which faith maketh is done by a kinde of reasoning which faith maketh thus hath god of his mercie given his owne son to be my saviour to shed his blood for mee and hath hee of his mercie graunted unto mee the pardon of all my sinnes i will therefore endeavoure to keepe my heart and my life unblameable that i doe not offende him hereafter in worde or deede as i have done heretofore the language of canaan is whereby a man endewed with the spirite of adoption unfainedly calleth upon the name of god in christ and so consequently doth as it were familiarly talke and speake with god this language must needes be learned that the tongue may be well governed for man must first be able to talke with god before he can be able wisely to talke with man for this cause when man are to have communication one with another they are first of all to be carefull that they often make their prayers to god that he would guide and blesse them in their speeches as david did set a watch o lorde before my mouth and keepe the dore of my lippes and againe o lord open thou my lippes and my mouth shall shew forth thy praise where we may see that the mouth is as it were locked up fro speaking any good thing untill the lord open it and paul having the gift of ordering his tongue in wonderful measure yet desireth the ephesians to pray for him that utterance might be given him and good reason because god ruleth the tongue the gouernment of the tongue containeth two parts holy speech and holy silence in holy speech must be considered the matter of our speech and the manner the matter is commonly one of these three either god our neighbour or our selues as concerning god this caueat must be remembred that the honourable titles of his glorious majestie be neuer taken into our mouthes unlesse it be upon a weightie and just occasion so as we may plainly see that glorie will redound to him thereby and for this cause the thirde commandement was giuen that man might not take up the name of god in vaine that is rashly and lightly and therefore lamentable and fearefull is the practise euery where for it is a common thing with man to begin their speech and to place the titles of god most high majestie in the forefront almost of euery sentence by saying o lorde o god o good god o mercifull god o iesu o christ ampc if a man be to say any thing he will not say yes or nay but o lorde yes or o lorde nay if a man be to reprooue his inferiour he will presently say o lorde have mercie on vs what a sloubacke article thou what a lye is this ampc an earthly prince if he should haue his name tossed in our mouthes at euery worde would neuer beare it and how shall the euerliuing god suffer it nay how can he suffer it i say no more but thou with thy selfe thinke how for in the third commandement the punishment is set downe that he will not hold him guiltlesse that taketh his name in vaine and the angels in reuerence to god majestie couer their faces isa concerning our neighbour we are to consider whether the thing which wee are about to speake be good or evill this being weighed if it be good and so commendable then we are readily and cheerefully and that upon every occasion ro utter it especially in his absence whether he be a friend or a foe as s john writeth of demetrius demetrius saith he hath good report of all man and of the trueth it selfe yes and we our selves beare recorde and ye knowe that our testimonie is true as for the evill which any man shall knowe by his neighbour he is in no wise to speake of it whether it be an infirmitie or a grosse sinne unlesse in his conscience he shall finde him selfe called of god to speake a man is called to speake in three cases i when he is called before a magistrate amp is lawfully required to testifie the evill which he knoweth by another ii when any is to admonish his brother of any fault for his amendement iii when the hurt or daunger that may arise of the evill is to be prevented in others as a man may say to one well disposed take heede of such a mans company for he is given to such or such a vice to this ende they of the house of cloe doe certifie paul of the disorders in corinthian and ioseph certifieth his father of his brethrens slaunders in this case all treasons are to be revealed as tending to the ruine of the whole common wealth thus elisha revealeth the secret of the king of syria and if it shall be thought convenient to mencion the evill which we know by any man it must be done onely in generall maner the person amp all circumstances which will descrie the person concealed concerning things which are secret in our neighbour we are not to be suspicious but to suspend both speech and judgement love suspecteth no evill iudge nothing saith paul before the time untill the lord come who will lighten things that are hidde in darknesse and make the counsells of the heart manifest augustine hath a good and a speciall rule to this purpose that there be three thinges of which wee must give no judgement god predestination the scriptures and the estate of man uncalled as touching a mans selfe he is neither to praise nor dispraise him selfe as salomon saieth let another man praise thee and not thine owne mouth a straunger and not thine owne lippes yet otherwhiles the times doe fall out that a man may use an holy kinde of boasting especially when the disgrace of the person is the disgrace also of the gospell and of religion and of god himselfe as paul did but wherein saith he any vvill use boldnesse i speake foolishly i vvill use boldnesse they are hebrevves so am i ampc thvs much of the matter of our speech nowe followeth the manner in the manner of our speaking three thinges are to be pondered what must be done before we speake what in speaking what after we have spoken before we speake consideration must be used of the thing to be spoken and of the end iames requireth that man should be slowe to speake and swift to heare salomon saith he that answereth a matter before he heare it it is follie amp shame to him the minde is the guide of the tongue therefore man must consider before they speake the tongue is the messenger of the heart and therefore as oft as we speake without meditation going before so oft the messenger runneth without his arrand the tongue is placed in the middle of the mouth chrys homily ad pop antioch and it is compassed in with lippes and teeth as with a double trench to shewe us howe we are to use heede and preconsideration before we speake and therefore it is good advise to keepe the key of the mouth not in the mouth but in the cupbourd of the heart augustine saith well that as in eating and drink man make choyce of meates so in manifolde speeches we should make choyce of talke here are condemned idle wordes that is such wordes as are spoken to little or no ende or purpose and they are not to be esteemed as little sinnes when as man are to give account of every idle worde when we are in speaking two thinges are to be practised first care must be had of the speach that it be gratious secondly it is to be uttered with convenient bondes of trueth the speech is gratious when it is so uttered that the graces of god wrought in the heart by the holy ghost are as it were pictured and painted foorth in the same for speach is the very image of the heart contrarie to this is rotten speach that is all such talke as is voide of grace which is the heart and pith of our speach and by this it appeareth ephesians psalm that no vice can be named but with disliking amp hereupon in scriptures when by occasion a vice should be named in token of a loathing thereof the name of the vice is omitted and the name of the contrarie vertue used in the roome thereof as in these wordes iob kin for iob thought it may be that my sonnes have sinned and blessed that is blasphemed god this being true then by proportion the visible representation of the vices of man in the worlde which is the substance and matter whereof playes and enterludes are made is much more to be avoyded god graces which we are to shewe foorth in our communication are these wisedome trueth reverence modestie meekenesse sobrietie in judgement vrbanitie fidelitie care of others good name but let us consider of them in order wisedome in our speach is a goodly ornament the apostles when they waited for the holy ghost in hierusalem it descended upon them in the forme of fiery tongues amp then it is said that they spake as the holy ghost gave them utterace in apophthegmes or wise sentences and he that governeth his tongue wisely addeth doctrine to the lips that is so speaketh as that others be made wise thereby this wisedome is then shewed when a man can in judgement apply his talke and as it were in good maner make it fit to all the circumstances of persons times places thinges a foole powreth out all his mind but a wise man keepeth in till afterwarde a worde spoken in his place is like apples of golde with pictures of silver now he that would have his speach to be wise must first of all him selfe become a wise man and the wise man of whome the holy scriptures speake is a godly man and such an one as feareth god because this feare of god is the beginning and head of wisedome as on the contrarie the foole whereof the scripture often speaketh is the ungodly person that maketh no conscience of any sinne and indeede such a one is the most senselesse foole of all he that shall ever and anon be casting him selfe into the fire and water and runne upon daungerous places to breake his legges armes necke and further shal take pleasure in doing al this is either a foole or a mad man now the ungodly man as oft as he sinneth he indevoureth as much as in him lieth to pitch his soule into hel amp wheras he taketh pleasure in sinne he sports him selfe with his owne destruction furthermore the man fearing god must have two things in his heart a perswasion of god presence and awe the perswasion of god presence is whereby a man is continually resolved that wheresoeuer he is he standeth before god who doeth see even into the secrets of his heart this was in cornelius now therefore saith he we are in god presence to heare all things that are commaunded thee of god awe in regard of god is that whereby a man behaveth him selfe reuerently because he is in god presence awe is either in regard of sinne or of chastisements awe in respect of sinne is when one is afraide to sinne fearing not so much the punishment as sinne it selfe because it is sinne for he feareth god indeede which is of this minde that if there were no iudge to condemne him no hell to torment him no divell nor conscience to accuse him yet he would not sinne because god blessed majestie is by it offended and displeased and if he had it in his choyce whether he would sinne or loose his life he had rather dye then willingly and wittingly sinne against god this awe being in ioseph was the cause that mooved him not to commit follie with putiphars wife gen how then saith he can i doe this great wickednesse and sinne against god awe in chastisements is when one humbleth him selfe under the mightie hande of god with all meekenesse and patience when god layeth his hande on him more or lesse when shemi came foorth and cursed david and flung stones at him what did he truely he stoode in awe of god and therefore saide sa what have i to doe with you ye sonnes of zerviah for he curseth even because the lorde hath bidden him curse david who dare then say wherefore hast thou done so when a man is thus made wise that is righteous and fearing god he is so guided by the spirite of feare that he can not but speake wisely salomon saith prov the lippes of the righteous knowe what is acceptable but the mouth of the wicked speaketh frowarde thinges and againe the heart of the wise guideth the mouth wisely contrarie to this is fond and foolish talke an example hereof we have in luke where pilate wanting the feare of god saith i finde no fault in christ let us therefore chastise him luke and send him away trveth of speach is a vertue whereby a man speaketh as he thinketh and so consequently he speaketh as every thing is so farre forth as possiblie he can it is made a note of a righteous man to speake the trueth from the heart and they that deale truely are god delight this is alwayes required in all our doctrines accusations defences testimonies promisses bargainings counsels but especially in iudges and magistrates sitting on judgement seate because then they stand in god steade who is trueth it selfe to this place belongeth apollogie which is when a christian called before a magistrate and straightly examined of his religion confesseth christ boldly and denieth not the trueth contrary to this is lying cogging glosing smoothing dissembling as for example gehazi after hee had received money and garments of naaman the syrian against elis es will he went and stoode before his master who saide unto him whence commest thou gehazi who making it nothing to lye for a vantage smoothed it over finely and sayde thy servaunt went no whither to the like effect and purpose report is made of a rich man that had two chestes the one whereof he calleth all the worlde the other his friende in the first hee putteth nothing in the seconde he putteth all his substance when his neighbour came to borrowe money he useth to answere truely i have never a penny in all the worlde meaning his emptie chest but i will see saith he what my friend can doe looking thereby for interest by the money out of his other chest this vice is very common and it is a rare thing to finde a man that maketh a conscience of a lye lying is when a man speaketh otherwise then the trueth is with a purpose to deceive here note that there is great difference betweene these two speeches it is an untrueth and it is a lye the first may be used when a man speaketh falshoodes but in using the seconde we must be heedie and sparing for when a man is challenged for a lye three thinges are layde to his charge i that he speaketh falsely ii that he is willing to doe so iii that he hath a desire and purpose to deceive quest whether may not a man lye if it be for the procuring of some great good to our neighbour or to the whole countrey where we are answer no reasons are these i lying is forbidden iam prov as an abomination to the lord ii rom we are not to doe any evill that good might come thereof iii he which lyeth in so doing conformeth him selfe to the devill who ioh is a lyar and the father thereof object i such lying is for our neighbours good and not against charitie answer no for corinthian charitie rejoyceth in the trueth object ii the holy scriptures haue mentioned the lyes of the patriarches answer we must not live by examples against rules of god worde object iii rahab and the mydwives of egypt in saving the spies and in preserving the israelites infantes used lying and are commended for their factes answer they are commended for their faith not for any lying as trueth is required in speech so also reuerence to god and man reuerence to god is when we so speak of god and use his titles that wee shew reuerence our selues and mooue reuerence in others deu if thou wilt not keepe saith the lorde and doe all the wordes of this lawe that are written in this booke and feare the glorious and fearfull name the lord thy god then the lorde will make thy plagues wonderfull here take heede of all maner of blaspheming which is when man use such speeches of god as doe either detract any thing from his majestie or ascribe any thing to him not beseeming him a sinne of all to be detested reasons i a blasphemer is viler then the rest of the creatures for they praise god in their kinde and shew foorth his power goodnesse and wisdome but he dishonoureth god in his wretched speech ii hee is as the madde dogge that flyeth in his masters face who keepeth him and giueth him bread iii custome in blasphemies sheweth a man to be the child of the deuill and no child of god as yet a father lying on his death bed called the three children to him which hee kept and tolde them that onely one of them was his owne son and that the rest were onely brought up by him therfore unto him hee gaue all his goods but which of these three was his naturall son he would not in any wise declare when hee was deade euery one of the three children pleaded that hee was the son and therefore that the goods were his the matter being brought before a iudge could not be ended but the iudge was constrained to take this course hee caused the dead corpes of the father to be set up against a tree and commaunded the three sonnes to take bowes and arrowes and to shoote against their father and to see who could come neerest the heart the first and seconde did shoote at their father and hitte him the thirde was angrie with both the other and refused to shoot this done the iudge gaue sentence that the two first were no sonnes but the third onely and that he should haue the goods the like triall may be used to know who be god children such persons with whome blaspheming is rife are very devil incarnate and the children of the deuill who rend god in pieces and shoote him through with their dartes as it is said of the egyptian when hee blasphemed that hee smote or pierced through god name againe here wee must be warned to take heede of that customable swearing and also of perjurie it is a very strange sinne for the perjured person doeth not onely sinne himselfe but withall he endeavoureth to intangle god in the same sinne with himselfe further take heede least thou doest either make or recite the jestes which are contrived out of the phrases of scripture which are very many and verie usually rehearsed in company the oyle wherewith the tabernacle and the arke of the testament and the priestes were annointed was holy and therefore no man might put it to any other uses as to annoint his owne flesh therewith or to make the like unto it john pilate a poore painyme when he heard the name of the son of god was afraid and we much more ought to tremble at the word of god not to make our selves merry with it and therefore the scoffing of iulian the apostata is very fearefull who was wont to reach christians boxes on the eare and with all bidde them turne the other and obey their masters commandement whosoever shall smite thee on the right cheeke turne to him the other also and he denied pay and like reward to his souldiers that were christians because he saide he would make them fitte for the kingdome of heauen considering that christ had said blessed are the poore in spirite for theirs is the kingdome of heaven here also man must learne to take heed of all manner of charmes and inchauntments which commonly are nothing else but words of scripture or such like used for the curing of paines and diseases both in man and beastes as for example the first words of s iohns gospell in the beginning was the worde and the worde was with god ampc are used to be written in a paper and hung about mens neckes to cure agues but the truth is such kinde of practises are deuilish patrones of charmes holde that in such wordes as are either diuine or barbarous is much efficacie but whence is this efficacie from god from man or from the deuill if it shall be saide from god we must knowe that the worde used in holy maner is the instrument of god to convey unto us spirituall blessings as faith regeneration repentance but it doeth not serve to bring unto us corporall health well then belike wordes take vertue from the speaker and are made powerfull by the strength of his imagination indeed of this opinion are some phisitians as avicenna and paracelsus who thinke that phantasie is like to the sun which worketh on all things to which his beames doe come and the latter that by imagination miracles may be wrought but this opinion is fonde and the reasons alledged for it are without weight for imaginations are no things but shadowes of things and as an image of a man in a glasse hath no power in it but only serves to resemble amp represent the bodie of a man so it is with the phantasie and conceit of the minde amp no otherwise and if imagination haue any force it is only within the spirits and humour of a mans owne bodie but to give force to worke in the body of others it can not no more then the shadow of one bodie can ordinarily cure the body of another on which it lighteth wherefore words used in the way of bodily cure be they in they in them selues never so good are no better then the devil sacraments and when they are used of blinde people he it is that comming under hand worketh the cure amp by turning himselfe into an angell of light deludes them but it were better for a man to die a thousand times then to use such remedies which in curing the body destroy the soule lastly avoid all imprecations and cursings either against man or other creatures for god in judgement to punish such cursed speaking often brings to passe such imprecations as may appeare in the iewes who at the arraignment of christ cryed saying his blood be upon us and upon our children which imprecation is verified upon them till this day at newburge in germany a certaine mother cursed her son saying get thee away i would thou mightest never come againe alive the very same day he went into the water and was drowned againe a mother brought her child to the vniversitie of wittemberge by reason he was possessed with an uncleane spirit beeing demaunded how it came to passe she answered in the hearing of many that in her anger shee saide the devill take thee and thereupon presently the childe was possessed and in our countrey man often wish the plague the poxe the pestilence to their children their servant their cattell and often it falles out accordingly reuerence to man is in two respects either because he is created after the image of god or because he is aboue us in age giftes authority in the first consideration man must haue care to giue such names to children as are proper and fit usuall and knowne the signification whereof may admonish them of the promises of god of godlines or of some good duty and there be foure allowed endes of giving names i to preserue the memory of some thing by the name giuen as adam israell isaac ii to signifie some thing to come as evah abraham john peter iii to preserue the name and memorie of parentes and kindred which was used in the birth of john baptist this custome may still be retained if there be any good example in the ancetours that the childe may follow iiii that the life and profession of good man may be revived in the renuing of their names here we must take heed in no wise to giue to children the proper names or titles of god as iesus immanuel ampc neither are the professours of the gospell to be intituled by the names of such as have beene famous instruments in the church as to be called calvinists lutheranes ampc now this i say that every one of you saith i am paules and i am apollos i am cephas and i am christes is christ divided or was paul crucified for you either were ye baptized in the name of paul and it is a bold part of the pestilent generation of papistes who take to themselves the name of jesuit for the name of christian was given to the disciples at antioch not by the devise of man but by devine oracle reverence to man as he is superiour is in using fitte titles of reverence sara is commended in scriptures for obeying her husband and for calling him syr but excesse must here be avoided when titles of honour proper to god are given to man as head of the catholique church to the pope lady and queene of heaven to the mother of christ this fault christ this fault christ reprooved in the young man saying why callest thou me good there is none good but god modesty in speech hath diverse caveats first if a man speake any thing of him selfe that is in his owne commendation let him alter the person and speake of him selfe as of another i know a man saith paul speaking of him selfe in christ above fourteene yeres agoe ampc which was taken up into paradise and heard wordes which can not be spoken and john saith of himselfe when iesus sawe his mother and the disciple whome he loved standing by ampc here take heede of boasting whereby man imitate the devill who said all this power will i give thee and the glorie of those kingdomes for that is delivered unto me and to whomsoeuer i will give it againe when a man shall have occasion to speake of his owne faultes and corruptions let him speake the uttermost against himselfe as paul called him selfe the first of all sinners but be to mention any thing of him selfe that may minister matter of commendation let his speech rather incline to the defect then to the excesse as paul saith i am the least of the apostles which not meete to be called an apostle because i persecuted the church of god secondly in the mentioning of things which moove blushing we are to use as seemely wordes as may be chosen gen afterwarde adam knewe hevah his wife which conceived and bare cain sam and when he came to the sheepecoates by the way where there was and saul went in to cover his feet that is to doe his easement meekenesse also required in communication which is when a man useth and faire speech remembrance ampc that they be courteous shewing all meekenesse to all man for we our selves also were in times past unwise disobedient ampc meekenesse and gentlenesse shewes it selfe in salutations answeres and reproofes for the first daily experience sheweth that it maketh much for the maintaining of love to call man by their proper names or surnames and this was a signe of speciall favour that god called moses by his proper name yet more convenient it is to salute our betters by names of honour or office thus the disciples call our saviour christ rabbi and it was the usuall manner among the iewes to call their betters adon that is lorde or syr the formes of salutations are to be after the order practised in scripture an angell saluted gedeon thus the lorde be with thee thou valiant man and boaz came to bethlehem and said to the repers the lorde be with you and they answered the lorde blesse thee and the angell saluted mary haile freely beloved the lorde is with thee ampc christ comming among his disciples saide peace be among you and he taught them comming to any house to say peace be to this house by this it appeareth that our common formes of salutations are commendable which are of diverse sortes as when one meetes another god save you when one goes away god be with you in the morning god give you a good morning after noone god give you a good evening when one is going on his journey god speede your journey when one is working god speede you in eating much good doe it you when one hath a new office god give you joy of your office when one is sicke god comfort you ampc and when children salute their fathers and mothers after this manner i pray you father blesse me i pray you mother blesse me it is a seemely thing for god hath made parents to be the instruments of blessing to their children in nurtoring them and praying for them as the fift commaundement saith honour thy father and mother that they may prolong thy dayes it is use in all places when a man neeseth to salute him by saying christ helpe you but there is no cause why the words should then be used more then at another time the reasons are i it is an olde custome fetched from the gentiles before christ and hath no ground at all for they used with the like wordes to wish man health because they thought neesing to be a sacred and holy thing and because some take it to be a signe of unhappie and evill successe which indeed is otherwise ii if there be any danger in the brain before neesing when a man hath neesed the danger is past as learned phisitians teach therfore there is no cause of the using such words then more then at coughing our answeres must be soft that anger be neither kindled nor increased a soft answere putteth away wrath but grievous words stirre up anger nabal by language provoked david to wrath but abigail by the contrarie appeased him gedeon spake gently to the man of ephraim when they were angry against him and appeased them for the text saith when he had thus spoken then their spirits abated towards him therefore salomon saith well a joy commeth to a man by the answere of his mouth but how good is a word in due season now if any shall raile on us our duty is not to raile againe blesse them that persecute you blesse i say and curse not be curteous not rendring evill for evill neither rebuke for rebuke but contrariwise blesse knowing that ye be thereunto called that you should be heires of blessing this thing was notably practised by david psalm for my friendship they were mine adversaries but i gave my selfe to prayer and therefore in this case either silence is to be used or at the most onely a just and manifest defence of our innocencie to be made ezechias commaunded the people to be silent and not to say any thing to the speech of rabsachai now flattering now threatning when eli spake hardly of anna amp badde her put away her drunkennesse she answered nay my lorde i am a woman troubled in spirite i have neither drunke wine nor strong drinke but have powred out my soule before the lorde thus ioseph cleareth him selfe saying i have done nothing wherefore they should put me in the dungeon and daniel to nabuchodonosor vnto thee o king have i done no hurt and our saviour christ when the iewes saide unto him say wee not true that thou article a samaritane and hast a devill answered i have not a devill but i honour my father and yee have dishonoured me and paul beeing to make an apologie for himselfe begins thus man and brother i have in all good conscience served god untill this day now when a man hath thus cleared him selfe though his owne worde in his owne behalfe take no effect yet let him patiently commit his cause to god who in time will manifest the trueth and bring it to light as david did iudge me o god saith he for i have walked in mine innocencie and againe the wicked watcheth the righteous and seeketh to slay him but the lorde will not leave him in his hande nor condemne him when he is judged meekenesse in reproofes is when any shall admonish his brother of any fault for his amendment with the like moderation that chirurgeons use who beeing to set the arme or legge that is forth of joynt handle it so tenderly that the patient shall scant feele when the bone falles in againe this counsell paul giveth breethren if any man be fallen by occasion into any fault ye which are spirituall restore such a one or set him in joynt againe with the spirite of meeknesse this was practised by abraham towardes lot when their heardmen were at variance saying let there be i pray thee no strife betweene thee and me neither betweene mne heardmen and thine for we are brother and this is done foure wayes first when wee reproove a man generally as nathan did david by a parable secondly when in the roome of a reproofe we put an exhortation in the exhortation insinuating an oblique reproofe as when a man shall sweare in his talke i shall not need alwaies to say yee doe verie ill to sweare and so to dishonour god but i w ll lappe it up in the forme of an exhortation as pilles are lapt in sugar by saying yes and nay yes and nay shall serue among us rebuke not an elder but exhort him as a father and young man as breethren saieth paul to timothie thirdly when the reproofe is propounded in a mans owne person as though hee were faultie which reprooveth paul practised this novv these things breethren saieth hee i have figuratively applyed to mine owne selfe and apollos for your sakes that yee might learne by us that no man presume above that which is vvritten fourthly when the fault is directly reprooved but yet partly with prefaces that wee doe it of love that wee wish well to the partie that wee speake as considering our selves that wee also are in daunger of the same fault and partly by framing the reproofe out of the worde of god that the partie may see him selfe rather to be reprooved by god then by us after this manner the inferiour may admonish his superiour especially when there is no other way of redresse and hee is to listen yeelding himselfe tractable naaman is advised by his servant who said father if the prophet had commaunded thee a great thing wouldest thou not have done it how much rather then when he saieth to thee wash and be cleane then went hee downe and washed him selfe seven times in iordan when any shall in this manner be admonished of a fault they are to yeeld themselves tractable and thankefull and heartily glad of so good a friend notable is the speech of the psalmist let the righteous smite me it is a benefite amp let him reproove me it is the chiefe ointment let it not be wanting to my head and salomon saith a reproofe entreth more into him that hath understanding then an hundreth stripes into a foole and open rebuke is better then secret love sobrietie in judgement is when a man either suspendeth his opinio of his neighbours sayings or doings or else speaketh as charitably as he can by saying as little as may be if the thing be euill or by interpreting all in better parte if the speech or action be doubtfull therefore doe thus despise not thy neighbour but thinke thy selfe as badde a sinner and that the like defectes may befall thee if thou canst not excuse his doing excuse his intent which may be good or if the deede be euill thinke it was done of ignorance if thou canst not no way excuse him thinke some great temptation befell him and that thou shouldest be worse if the like temptation befell thee and giue god thankes that the like as yet hath not befallen thee despise not a man being a sinner for though he be euill to day he may turne to morrow here is condemned all headie and rash judgement whereby man make things either worse then they are or else they take and turne all things to the worse parte thus the deuill dealt with iob saying doeth iob feare god for naught ampc but stretch out thine hand now and touch all that he hath to see if hee will not blaspheme thee to thy face such was the dealing of doeg with david i sawe the son of ishai saith he when he came to abimelech the son of ahitub who asked counsell of the lorde for him and gave him victuals and he gave him also the sworde of goliah the philistin here the backe bither concealeth the necessarie circumstances whereby achimelech might have beene excused as that david asked bread being hungrie and that he told not ahimelech that he was out of saules favour but he turneth all his speech to this end to bring the priest into suspicion with saul thus the pharises dealt john came neither eating nor drink and they say hee hath a devill the son of man came eating and drink and they say beholde a glutton and a drinker of wine and a friend of publicanes and sinners contrarie to this sobrietie is flatterie whereby for hope either of favour or gaine man and especially such as are of dignitie and place are soothed up in their sinnes and extolled above measure even to their faces as when herode arayed in royall apparell and sate on the judgement feare and made an oration the people gave a showte saying the voice of a god and not of a man but marke what salomon saith he that praiseth his friend with a lowde voice rising earely in the morning it shall be counted to him for a curse one being asked which was the worst of all beastes answered of wild beast the tyrant of tame beast the flatterer and another said that flatterers were worse then crowes for they eate onely dead carrion these feed on living man and of all kindes of flatterie that is the worst when a man shall speake faire to his neighbours face and praise him but behinde his backe speake his pleasure and euen cut his throate david complaineth of his familiar friend that the words of his mouth were softer then butter yet war was in his heart that his wordes were more gentle then oyle yet they were swordes the pharises behinde christes backe tooke counsell howe they might intangle him in talke but before his face they say master wee knowe that thou article true and teachest the way of god truely neither carest thou for any man for thou considerest not the person of man vrbanitie is a grace of speech whereby man in seemely manner use pleasantnesse in talke for recreation or for such delight as is joyned with profite to them selues and others the preacher saith there is a time to laugh and a time to weepe when the lorde brought againe the captivitie of sion we were like them that dreame then was our mouth filled with laughter and our tongue with joy now this mirth must be joyned with the feare of god otherwise salomon saith well i have saide to laughter thou article madde and of joy what is that thou doest and christ saith woe to you that now laugh for yee shall weepe secondly with compassion and sorow for god people in affliction and miserie they drinke wine in bowles and annoint themselves with chiefe oyntments but no man is sorie for the affliction of ioseph thirdly it must be sparing and moderate paul condemneth such as are lovers of pleasures more then of god fourthly it must be void of the practise of sinne moses is commended that he refused the pleasures of sinne the usuall time of mirth is at meates and here sampsons practise may bee followed who at his mariage feast propounded a riddle or harde question to his friendes and ambrose thinketh that he did this to stoppe the mouthes of talkers and to occupie their wits withall it must bee remembred to be a christian dutie even at the table to maintaine talke of religion and of duties of godlinesse after the practise of our saviour christ though many upon little ground thinke otherwise tertullian recordeth of the christians of his time that they used in their love feasts to talke togither as considering with themselves that they had god him selfe as an earewitnesse to them chrysostom of this point saith well i would to god saith he that in tavernes and feastes and at bathes man woulde talke and dispute of hell for the remembring of hell would hinder a man from falling to hell and it was the manner of the primative church at dinner and supper to use the reading of the scriptures when ye come to the table saith augustine heare that which is reade according to custome without any stirre or striving that your mouthes may not onely receive the meate but your eares may hunger after the worde of god and this holy rejoycing at meates is specially to be used with such as are godly as salomon saith that hee vvhich eateth at the covetous mans table shall vomite his morsels and shall loose his sweete wordes the faithfull at ierusalem did breake bread togither with gladnesse and singlenesse of heart quest whether jesting be tollerable in any sort or not answer that jesting which standeth in quippes tauntes and girdes which serveth onely for the offence of some with the delight of others is not tollerable because all speech must edifie and minister grace to the hearers neither doeth it agree with christian gravitie and modestie but two kindes of jesting are tollerable the one is moderate and sparing mirth in the use of things indifferent in season convenient without the least scandall of any man and with profite to the hearers the second is that which the prophets used when they jested against wicked persons yet so as withall they sharpely reprooved their sinnes at noone eliah mocked them and saide crie alowd for he is a god either he talketh or pursueth his enemy or is in his journey or it may be he sleepeth and must be awaked as for laughter it may be used otherwise god woulde never have given that power and facultie into man but the use of it must be both moderate and seldome as sorrowe for our sinnes is to be plentifull and often this we may learne in christ his example of whome wee reade that hee wept three times at the destruction of ierusalem at the raising of lazarus and in his agonie but wee neuer read that hee laughed fidelitie is constancie in all our lawful sayings and promises a promise is to be made with this condition if god will and then if a man be prevented by death or by any like meanes hee is not to be blamed otherwise a mans lawful worde and promise bindeth him according to the will and pleasure of him to whome it is made nowe if afterwarde it be hurtfull to him that made it he may crave to be free from his promise and libertie being graunted take it but a promise bound with an oth is to be kept though private hinderances follow yet so as the magistrate may order the matter and proceed in equitie that the dammage may be the lesse the last grace which is to be used in speech is care of our neighbours good name which is farre better to him then great riches here is condemned the tale bearer which of an euill mind telleth a thing of another to bring him into hatred or to reuenge himselfe or to get something which otherwise he could not obtaine this talebearing is of diverse sortes one is when man whisper abroade secretly the fault of another whereas they shoulde rather admonish the partie as cham when he had seene his fathers nakednesse ranne straight and tolde his breethren the second when they adde to or change the thing said or done as it serveth for their purpose some of the witnesses which came against christ charged him to say i will destroy this temple which is made with hands and in three dayes builde another without handes where first they chaunge his meaning for christ spake of the temple of his bodie secondly they adde to the wordes for christ saide not i will destroy this temple but destroy yee this temple therefore the holy ghost noteth them with the name of false witnesse bearers the thirde when man surmise and tell that which was never done when ieremie was going out of ierusalem to the lande of benjamin and was in the gate of benjamin irijah tooke him and saide thou fleest to the chaldeans then saide ieremie that is false i flee not to the chaldeans but hee would not heare him the fourth is the coloured tale bearing when one speaketh evill of another with fine prefaces and preambles feigning that he is very sory that his neighbour hath done such or such a thing that he speaketh it not of malice but of a good minde that hee is constrained to speake that he speaketh not all he could speake that the partie to whome the tale is tolde must keepe it secret luther writeth of this fault very well this vice saith he whereby wee tell abroad the things which we heare of others and take them in worse parte is very rife and of great force to sowe discordes the rather because it often sheweth it selfe under the pretence and name of counsell and good advise and it is a notable visard for a talebearer to transforme him selfe into an angell of light and under zeale for god glorie to backbite anll accuse his neighbour of heresie errour and wicked life therefore the prophets meaning is that we should conceale the evil that be in our neighbour and not speake them to others though he be an enemie and deserve it at our handes and onely speake of those good things in him which seeme to preserve concord for this we would that man shoulde doe unto us yes and let us take heede that we judge not or condemne any mans saying or doing rashly augustine saieth that this was the care which his mother had towards her enemy to doe this is a notable point of just dealing but indeed there is no man utterly without this fault in this life such is our wretched state in this worlde for though some are of this minde that they desire not to have other mens wants tolde them and will not take all in worse part yet if they be told and taken in worse parte of others they can willingly heare them neither will they checke the teller but suffer bad surmises to take place with them but gedaliah the son of ahicham excelled in the contrarie vertue who chose rather to hazard his life then to suspect evill by ismaell this tale bearing is the common table talke in england and it is wonderfull to see how those who are otherwise godly are overtaken with it but man must learne to stande more in awe of god commaundement and also to consider that the same thing a man speaketh of another commeth home againe by his owne dore wherfore when man shall enter any evill communication of others we are to interrupt it by other talke as not regarding it here remember that when governours and magistrates shall use harde wordes not in the way of defamation but for the reprooving of a vice it is not to slaunder as o foolish galathians o generation of vipers and christ tearmeth herod foxe thvs much of grace in speech now followeth bondes of trueth whereby the trueth of our talke is testified and confirmed there are three a simple assertion an asseveration an othe a simple assertion is either a simple affirmation as yes yea or a simple negation as nay nay they are to be used only in our familiar and common talke let your communication be yes yea nay nay and whatsoever is more commeth of evill if the trueth which we affirme or denie be doubtfull or contingent then such clauses as these it is so or it is not so as i thinke as i remember as i take it are to be added if one shall say it is so and afterwards it proove otherwise hee receiveth discredite because he spake an untrueth but if he shall say i thinke it is so though it fall out otherwise yet he saveth his credite because he deceiveth not but onely is deceivrd an asseveration is when one doeth vehemently affirme or deny any thing this is not to be used at euery worde but then onely when a trueth of greater importance is to be confirmed when the false prophets among the iewes and the priestes would not beleeve that ieremie was sent of god what saith he not simply the lord hath sent me but in trueth the lorde hath sent me our saviour christ when he used to speake any waightie matter used to say amen amen verily verily which is a plaine asseveration for amen is more then a simple affirmation and it is lesse then an othe as the very sence of the worde doth import which is no more but truely certenly the thirde is an othe which must not be made by any thing in heaven or earth but onely by the name of god alone it must be used as the last refuge and remedie of all for when any trueth of great importance is to be confirmed and all signes evidences proofes witnesses faile among man on earth then wee may lawfully fetch the lorde as a witnesse from heauen who is the knower of all trueth and in this case an othe may be taken either publikely before a magistrate or privately among private persons if it be done with reverence and consideration as it was betweene iacob and laban after a man hath spoken his minde very fewe wordes more are to be added he that hath knowledge spareth his words in many words there can not want iniquitie but he that refraineth his lippes is wise he that speaketh many wordes speaketh either false things or superfluous or both as when a river overfloweth the water gathereth much slime so many wordes many faultes when a vessell being smitten maketh a great noise it is a token that it is emptie and so the sound of many wordes shewes a vaine heart the gentiles have said that god gave a man one tongue and two eares that hee might heare more and speake lesse valerius maximus reporteth of xenocrates that being in the company of some that used railing speeches held his tongue and being asked why he did so answered that it had repented him that he had spoken but it never repented him that he had helde his peace and the proverbe is he that will speake what he will shall heare what he would not to the framing of our speech ambrose requireth three things a yoke a ballance and a metwand a yoke to keepe it in a stayed gravitie a ballance to giue it weight of reason a metwand to keepe it in measure and moderation this rule must be practised carefully for the avoiding of chiding brawling and contention let nothing be done by contention philip let students and schollars learne to practise this for what shall another mans opinion hurt thee though in reasoning he be not of thy minde in every point here take heede of the spirit of contradiction whereby some by thwarting and contradicting euery man at length prooue either obstinate heretikes or lewde atheists and make no bones to contradict the holy ghost and to call the scriptures in question and dispute that there is no god nowe if a man speake necessarie thinges though he continue his speech till midde night as paul did it can not be called immoderate or superfluous talke all this which is set downe concerning speech must as well be practised in writing as in speaking whereby are condemned ballads bookes of loue all idle discourses and history being nothing els but inticements and baites unto manifold sinnes fitter for sodom and gomorrah then for god church and it must be followed as well in speaking of latine or any other tongue as english which students haue not marked for whereas they will not sweare in english yet in latine they make no bones of it saying mehercule medis fidis aedipol per deos immortales and whereas they holde but one god in judgement yet in their latine exercises they speake of iupiter and of the immortall god after the manner of the heathen what a shame is this that a christian and that in christian schooles should either be ashamed or not use to speake as a christian but as atheists do if thou haue many tongues and knowest not howe to use them well hee which hath but his mother tongue ordering it aright is a better linguist then thou wise and godly silence is as excellent a vertue as holy speech for hee knoweth not howe to speake which knoweth not howe to holde his tongue the rule of our silence must be the lawe of god by meanes of which wise consideration must be had whether the thing which we haue in mind be for god glory and our neighbours good which done wee are answearably to speake to be silent here must be considered the things of which silence must be used and the persons before whome the things are many first if any trueth be to the hinderance of god glorie or of the good of our neighbour it must be concealed the concealing of the trueth is either in whole or in parte in whole when the speaking of the least worde is hurtfull as for example the father and the son are both sicke at once the son dieth first the father asketh whether his son be dead or not if it be said no an untrueth is told if yes then the fathers griefe is increased and his death hastened therefore silence is the best in dayes of persecution holy martyrs haue chosen rather to suffer death then to reueale their brother that haue bene of their priuate assemblies with them the concealing of a thing in part is when a man speakes a little of the trueth and concealeth the rest which is warranted in all good and lawful proceedings which manifestly tend to the glorie of god when samuel david he answereth the lord and saith an i goe for if saul of it he will kill me then the lord answered with thee and say i am come to sacrifice to the and call for to sacrifice and i will thee had shewed king zedekiah how he might escape death then the king said unto him let no man knowe of these wordes ampc but if the princes understand that i have talked with thee and they come unto thee and say unto thee declare unto us what the king hath said unto thee ampc then shalt thou say unto them i humbly besought the king that he would not cause me to to house to die there and afterward he so answered and the matches was not perceived the like was practised by actes secondly thou article to conceale thine owne secrets sampson revealing his owne secret iudg overthrewe himselfe if thou desire ease by revealing then ell them but fewe and to such as are faithfull that which thou wouldest not haue knowen for howe shall another keepe thy counsell when thou canst not doe it keepe thy friendes likewise if it be not hurtfull and let ministers conceale the sinnes and wantes that trouble the conscience of such as are dying let magistrates conceale thinges done in the senate especially concerning war least they be reuealed to the enemie if god bring any strange thing to passe speake not boldely of it but in silence wonder iob at the consideration of god majestie in his workes saith beholde i am vile what shall i answere thee i will lay my hande upon my mouth na b and abehu for offer incense with strange fire before the lord were both distroyed with fire which beeing done moses told aaron that god would bee sanctified in them that come neere him and be glorified before all the people and then the text saith but aaron helde his peace when peter had taught the gentiles and after returned to hierusalem they of the circumcision contended with him he then rendreth a reason of his fact which being made they were silent for so the text is when they heard these thinges they helde their peace and glorified god when god judgementes befall man among us if wee speake any thing we must judge charitable blessed is hee that judgeth wisely of the poore the lorde shall deliver him in the time of trouble thirdely the infirmities and sinnes of our neighbours are alwayes to bee concealed unlesse it be in the case before named that wee finde our selues called of god to speake he that covereth a transgression seeketh love if god in mercie cover his sinnes why shouldest thou reveale them salomon saith it is the glorie of a man to passe by an infirmitie fourthly all unseemely matters all thinges unknowen thinges which concerne us not things above our reach are in silence to be buried the persons before whome silence must be used are these i malitious enemy of religion give not that which is holy unto dogges neither cast your pearles before swine this was among the rest one cause of the silence of christ before caiaphas and pilate ii secondly before magistrates in their open courtes where such as come before them are not to speake till they bee bidden then paul after that the governour had beckened unto him that he should speake answered iii in the presence of our elders and betters who must have leave and libertie to speake first and must of others be heard with silence the practise of this was in elihu to elithaz and bildad a company of man as some say is like to the alphabet in which are vowels halfe vowels and mutes vowels are olde man learned wise expert halfe vowels are young man and woman who are then onely to speake when they are asked mutes are the same parties who beeing not occasioned are in silence to heare their betters and here all servant and children must remember when they are justly reprooued to be silent and not to answere any thing againe iiii fooles and pratlers are not to be answered unlesse it be to let them see their follie thvs have i in parte set downe howe the tongue is to be governed and i heartily desire that christians woulde put these rules in practise reasons i if any man seeme to bee religious and restraine not his tongue he deceiveth himselfe and his religion is in vaine ii the man of an euill tongue is a beast in the forme of a man for his tongue is the tongue of a serpent under which lyeth nothing but venime and poison nay hee is worse then a serpent for it can not hurt unlesse it be present to see a man or to bite him or to strike him with his taile but he which hath not the rule of his tongue hurteth man as well absent as present neither sea nor land nor any thing can hinder him and againe his throate is like a graue that hath a vent in some parte and therefore sendeth foorth nothing but stinke and corruption iii as the holy man of god when they preached had their tongues as it were touched with a cole from the altar of god and as godly man when they speake gratiously haue their tongues inflamed with the fire of god spirite so contrariwise when thou speakest euill thy tongue is kindled by the fire of hell and sathan comes from thence with a cole to touch thy lippes and to set them on fire to all manner of mischiefe chrysostom saith that when man speake good things their tongue is the tongue of christ but all manner of ungodly and cursed speaking is the devil language iiii the moderating of the tongue is a matter of great difficultie s iames saith the whole nature of beast and of birdes and of creeping things ampc but the tongue can no man tame it is an unruly evill pambus one without learning came to a certaine man to be taught a psalme who when hee had hearde the first verse of the psalme i said that i will keepe my wayes that i offend not in my tongue would not suffer the next verse to be read saying this verse is ynough if i coulde practise it and when his teacher blamed him because he sawe him not of sixe moneths he answered that hee had not yet done the verse and one that knewe him many yeres after asked him whether he had yet learned the verse i am fourtie yeeres olde sayeth hee and have not yet learned to fulfill it now then the harder it is to rule the tongue the more care is to be had therein v the straunge judgements of god for the abuse of the tongue especially in blasphemies and perjuries are many and fearefull three man conspired together against narcissus bishoppe of hierusalem a man that ledde a godly and blamelesse life and they charged him with a most heynous crime all three confirme their accusation by othe the first wisheth if it were not so that he were burnt the second that hee might die of the jaundise the third that he might loose his eyes afterward in processe of time the first had his house set on fire in the night and hee with all his family was burnt the second had the jaundise from the head to the sole of the foote and died thereof the third seeing what was befallen these twaine repented and confessed the conspiracie against narcissus and yet for all that hee lost his eyes againe in the dayes of q mary as iames abbes was ledde by the sheriffe to execution diverse poore people stoode in the way and asked their almes he then having no money to give them did pull off all his apparell saue his shirte and gave it unto them to some one thing to some another in the giving whereof hee exhorted them to be strong in the lorde and to stande steadfaste to the trueth of the gospell while he was thus instructing the people a servant of the sheriffes going by cryed out alowde and blasphemously saide beleeue him not good people he is an heretique and a mad man out of his witte beleeue him not for it is heresie that hee saieth and as the other continued in his godly admonitions so did this wicked wretch blowe foorth his blasphemous exclamations untill they came unto the stake where he shoulde suffer but immediatly after this martyr was bounde to the stake and fire put to him such was the fearefull stroke of god justice upon this blasphemous railer that hee was there presently in the sight of all the people stricken with a frensie wherewith hee had before railingly charged that good martyr of god who in this furious rage and madnesse casting off his shoes and the rest of his cloth cryed out unto the people and saide thus did iames abbes the true servant of god who is saved but i am damned and thus ranne hee rounde about the towne of burie still crying that iames abbes was a good man and saved but i am damned againe children sitting in company together fell into communication of god and to reason what god was and some saide one thing some another among the rest one saide he is a good olde father to which another named dennis benfielde replyed with a most outragious blasphemie what he said shee is an old doting foole but shortly after this young gyrle was so stricken that all the one side of her was blacke and shee became speechlesse and died againe one leav a ploughman railing said that he saw the favoured knaue latimer when he was burned and also in despite saide that hee had teeth like an horse at which time and houre as neere as could be gathered the son of the saide leaver most wickedly hanged himselfe againe in the time of k edward a young gentleman of cornwall being in company with other moe gentlemen togither with their servant beeing about the number of twentie horse man among whome this lustie yonker entred into talke and began withal to sweare and use ribauld speech being gently reprooved the young gentleman tooke snuffe and said to the reproover why takest thou thought for me take thought for thy winding sheete well quote the other amend for death giveth no warning for he soone commeth a lambs skinne to the market as an old sheepes skinne god wounds saith he care not thou for me raging still in this maner worse and worse in wordes till at length passing on their journey they came riding ouer a great bridge standing ouer a piece of an arme of the sea upon which bridge this gentleman swearer spurred his horse in such sorte as hee spring cleane over with the man on his backe who as he was going cried saying horse and man and all to the devill againe there was a serving man in lincolnshire who had still in his mouth an use to sweare god pretious blood and that for very trifles being often warned by his friendes to leave the taking of the lord blood in vaine did notwithstanding still persist in his wickednesse untill at the last it pleased god to acite him first with sicknesse and then with death during which time of the lordes visitation no perswasion could moue him to repent his foresaid blaspheming but hearing the bell to towle did most hardly in the anguish of his death start up in his bed and sware by god blood this bell towled for me whereupon immediatly the blood abundantly from all the joynts of his body as it were in streames did issue out most fearfully from mouth nose wrestes knees heeles and toes with all other joyntes not one left free and so dyed these and such like judgements must be as warnings from heauen to admonish us and to make us afraid of the abuse of the tongue especially when it tendeth to the dishonour of god and we are to imitate the example of policarpe the martyr who when hee was bidden to take his othe and curse christ answered fourescore and sixe yeeres haue i beene his servant yet in all this time hath he not so much as once hurt me how then may i speake euill of my king and soueraigne lorde which hath thus preserued me vi lastly god hath honoured thy tongue with the gifte of speech and utterance and the great excellencie of this gift thou shouldest perceiue if thou werest stricken dumme for a time therefore let thy tongue be applyed to the honouring of god and to the good of thy neighbour

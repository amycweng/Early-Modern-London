a reprobate hath in his mind a certain ro psalm knowledg of god of common equitie among man of the difference of good from bad and this is partly from nature partly from the contemplation of god creatures in which the wisedom the power the loue the mercie the maiestie of god is perceiued this knowledge is only generall and imperfect much like the ruines of a princes pallace it is not sufficient to direct him in doing of a good worke for example the reprobate knoweth that there is a god and that this god must be worshipped come to particulars who god is what a one hee is howe hee must bee worshipped here his knowledge faileth him and he is altogether vncertaine what to doe to please god by reason of this knowledge the reprobate doth giue consent and in his heart subscribeth to the equitie of god lawe as may appeare by the saying of medea video meliora probque deteriora sequor that is i knowe what is best to be done and like it yet i doe the worst this approbation in the reprobate commeth from constraint and is ioyned with a disliking of the lawe in the elect ro being called the approbation of the lawe it proceedeth from a willing amp ready mind and is ioyned with loue and liking and by reason of this light of nature a meere natural man and a reprobate may be subiect to some temptations for example he may be tempted of the deuill and of his owne corrupt flesh to beleeue that there is no god at all as ouid saith of himselfe eleg sollicitor nullos esse putare deos i am often tempted to thinke there is no god the reprobate for all this knowledge in his heart may be an atheist as dauid saith psalm rom the foole hath saide in his heart there is no god and a man may nowe a daies finde houses and townes full of such fooles nay this glimering light of nature except it be preserued with good bringing vp with diligent instruction and with good company it will be so darkened that a man shall knowe very little and leade a life like a very beast as experience telleth and dauid knew very well who saith psalm man is in honor and vnderstandeth not he is like to beast that perish wherfore this knowledge which the reprobate receiueth from nature amp from the creatures albeit it is not sufficient to make him doe that which shall please god yet before god iudgement seat act rom it cutteth off all excuse which he might alleage why he should not be condemned heb pet beside this naturall knowledge the reprobate may be made partaker of the preaching of the word and be illuminated by the holy ghost and so may come to the knowledge of the reuealed will of god in his word thus when they heare the preaching of the word god profereth saluation to them and calleth them matthew luke prov ver john luke yet this calling is not so effectuall in them as it is in the elect children of god for the reprobate when he is called he liketh himselfe in his owne blindnes and therefore neither will hee and if he would yet could he not answer and be obedient to the calling of god the elect being called with speede he answereth and commeth to the lord and his hart being ready giueth a strong and a loud eccho to the voice of the lorde this eccho wee see in dauids heart psalm when saith he thou saidest seeke ye my face mine heart answered vnto thee o lord i wil seeke thy face and god himself speaketh the same of his children zacha they shall call on my name and i will heare them i will say it is my people nowe marke the eccho and they shall say the lord is my god after that he hath an vnderstanding of god word he act he may acknowledge the truth of it and confesse it amp if need require be a defender of it as iudas was amp iulian the apostata the reprobate may haue a feeling of his sins amp so acknowledge them amp the punishment due vnto them sam as saul did who said i haue sinned come againe my son dauid for i will doe thee no harme because my soule was pretiou in thy eies this day behold i haue done foolishly and haue erred exceedingly thus did cain gen when he said my punishment is greater then i can beare eus li cap galerius maximinus a vile persecutor of christias had his bowels rotting within him so that an infinite number of wormes continually craulled foorth of his bodie and such a poysoning stinke came from him that no man could abide him being thus plagued with the hand of god hee began to perceiue his wickednes in persecuting christians and he confessed his sins to the true god and assembling the chiefe about him he commaunded that all within his dominions shoulde cease to trouble christians and in all hast he made a law for the peace and liberty and the publike meetings of christians the reprobate hath oftentimes feare and terror of conscience but this is onely because he considereth the wrath and vengeance of god which is most terrible when paul preached before foelix amp by the maiestie of god spirit did as it were thunder from heauen against his sinnes doubtlesse he made his heart to ake and euery ioint of him to tremble ecebolius a philosopher of constantinople in the daies of constantius professed christian religion and went beyond all other in zeale for the same religion yet afterward vnder iulian he fell from that religion vnto gentilisme but after iulians death making meanes to bee receiued into the church againe ouerwhelmed with the horror of his owne conscience for his wicked reuolting hee cast himselfe downe on the ground before the dores of the church crying aloude calcate me salem insipidum trample on me vnsauerie salt and the diuel beleeueth the word of god and at his owne damnation he trembleth these seruile feares though they harden the heart of the reprobate as heate doth the iron after it hath beene in the furnace yet these feares in the children of god act rom are very good preparations to make them fitte to receiue grace like as wee see the heedle which soweth not the cloth yet it maketh a passage and enterance for the threede which serueth for this vse to sowe cloth together a reprobate before he commit a sinne is often vexed within himselfe and feareth to commit it not because hee hateth and disliketh the sinne for it selfe but because he can not abide the punishment due vnto the sin mark when the daughter of herodias daunced before herode and pleased him that hee might doe her a pleasure hee bad her aske what shee woulde shee asked john baptists head in a platter herode did graunt her request but yet hee had a grudging in heart and he was sore grieued at it mat in like maner pilate was very much troubled inwardly before he condemned our sauiour christ after he hath committed a sinne he mat heb sorroweth and repenteth yet this repentance hath two wants in it first hee doth not detest his sinne and his former conuersation when he repenteth he doth bewaile the losse of many things which he once enioyed he cryeth out through very anguish and through the perplexities which god in his iudgement layeth on him yet for his life he is not able to leaue his filthy sinne and if he might be deliuered he would sinne as before gen amp amp esau wept before his father with great yelling amp crying but after hee was gone from his fathers presence hee hated his brother who had got his blessing and in contempt of his father chose him a wife against his fathers liking pharao as oft as the lorde laide any calamitie on him exo he euermore desired to bee deliuered from it yet afterward alwaies hee returned to his olde bias againe foelix trembled before paul for all that he coulde not leaue his couetousnes but euen then he sought for a bribe secondly the repobate when he repenteth hee can not come vnto god and seeke vnto him he hath no power no not so much as once to desire to giue one little sobbe for the remission of his sins if hee would giue all the worlde hee cannot so much as giue one rappe at god mercie gate that he may open to him he is very like a man vpon a racke who cryeth and roreth out for very paine yet cannot desire his tormentor to ease him of his paine gen sa mat caine would haue been voide of his trembling but hee coulde not aske pardon of his sinne from his heart neither coulde saul or iudas or now can the diuel the reprobate may humble himselfe for some sinnes which he hath committed and may declare this by fasting amp teares when eliah reproued ahab for his idolatry and threatned him from the lord it is said that when hee had heard these wordes re hee rent his cloth and put sackcloth vpon him and fasted and went softly in token of mourning and this humiliation staied god wrath for a time he may confesse his sinnes euen his particular sinnes before man but this is onely then when his soule is tormented for them and can find no ease for then hee sticketh not to vtter his secret filthinesse to the hearing of all man and to the open shaming of himselfe when god smote all that was in the fieldes of egypt with hayle then pharao sent and called for moses amp aaron amp sayd vnto them ex number i haue now sinned the lorde is righteous but i and my people are wicked pray ye vnto the lord for it is enough that there be no more mightie thunders ampc so iudas when he saw that christ was condemned and felt an hell in his conscience brake out and said i haue sinned in betraying the innocent bloud and the experience of these dayes giueth fearefull examples for the proofe of this point he hath often a desire to be like the children of god and to be saued not becaus he hath anie loue to the kingdome of god but because he is afraide of hell as balaa ouerpressed with a feare of god iudgemet prayed thus oh that my soule might die the number death of the righteous and that my last ende might be like his the wicked in their distresse may pray to god and god may heare their prayers and graunt them their request number as the israelites wickedly murmuring against god desired flesh in the wildernes god heard their crie and rained quailes among them but god heareth the wicked after one sort and them that feare him after an other the that feare him he graunteth their requestes of loue amp mercie to the other of indignation and anger number psalm as may appeare in the israelites who when they were in eating of their quayles and the meat was within their teeth god in his anger stroke them with a sore plague and which is more strange then this god hath performed that which he hath promised to the vnbeleeuers though they refused to aske it at his handes isa of this thing wee haue a worthie example in king achas who vtterly refused to haue a signe of his deliuerance and the confusion of his ene ies when god offered it to him and yet e lord deliuered him the reprobate may yet goe further in the rofession of religion and may seeme for a ime to bee planted in the church for hee doth beleeue the promises of god made in christ iesus yet so that hee cannot applie them to himselfe in this thing the elect and the reprobate differ the reprobate luke generally in a confused maner beleeueth that christ is a sauiour of some man and he neither can nor desireth to come to the particular applying of christ the elect beleeueth that christ is a sauiour of him particularly the reprobates faith may perish in this life but the faith of the elect cannot the reprobate may be perswaded of the mercie and goodnes of god towardes him for the present time in the which hee eeleth it the elect is not onely perswaded of the mercies he presently inioyeth but also he is perswaded of his eternall election before the foundation of the world amp of his euerlasting life which yet he doth not inioy yes iob if god would confound him and he sawe nothing but present death and hell fire yet such is his nature that still he would beleeue for faith and hope are no grounded vppon sence and feeling but are the euidence of those thinges which were neuer yet seene or felt the life of the faithfull is hid in christ as the sappe in the roote of the tree their life is not in sence and feeling but in hoping and beleeuing which often times or contrary to mans sence and feeling is in dauid who saith create a newe heart in me psalm after that hee hath receiued a generall amp a temporal faith in god heauenly word and his most mercifull promises of euerlasting life contained therein by the power of the spirite of god h b math he commeth to haue a tast in his heart of the sweetnes of god mercies and a reioycing in consideration of the election adoption iustification and sanctification of god children but what is this tast i expresse it thus after the meaning of god word suppose a banket prepared in which are many sweete and pleasaunt and dainty meates at this banquet they which are the bidden guests they must be set downe they see the meates they tast them they chawe them in their mouthes they digest them they are nourished fed and strengthned by them they which are not bidden to this east may see the meates handle them and ast of them to feele how good they are but hey must not eate and feede of them the first resemble the elect which truely eate digest and are nourished by christ vnto euer asting life because they haue great aboundance of the vitall heate of god holy spirit in them and doe feele sensibly his grace and vertue in them to strengthen them and guide them the second sort truly resemble the reprobates which neuer in truth enioy christ or any of his benefites appertaining to saluation but onely see them and haue in their heartes a vanishing but no certaine or sound feeling of them so that they may be changed and strengthened and guided thereby to vse another similitude the reprobates haue no more feeling and enioying of christ and his benefites than those man haue of the sun which see onely a glimmering of his light at the dawning of the day before it riseth pet ioh luke isaiah contrarywise the elect they haue the day star euen the son of righteousnes iesus christ rising in their hearts the day spring from an high doth visite them the glorie of god doth rise vpon them they haue their eies annointed with the ointment of the spirite which is the true eie salue and do plainely behold this son of righteousnes they inioy his presence they effectually feele his comfortable heate to quicken an reuiue them from this sence and taste of god grace proceede manie fruites as first generallie he may do outwardly all things which true christians doe and he may leade such a life here in this world that although he cannot attaine to saluation yet his paynes in hell shall bee lesse which appeareth in that our sauiour christ saith it shall bee easier for math tyrus amp sydon for sodome and gomorrah than for capernaum and other cities vnto which hee came in the day of iudgement also the reprobate may haue a loue of god but this loue can bee no sincere loue for it is only because god bestoweth benefites and prosperitie vpon him as appeareth in saule sa who loued god for his aduauncement to the kingdome and here is a difference betweene the elect and reprobate the elect loue god as children their fathers but reprobates as hirelings their maisters whome they affect not so much or themselues as for their wages also a reprobate hath often a reioycing n doing those things which appertayne to he seruice of god as preaching amp praier mark herod heard john baptist preach gladlie mat and the seconde kinde of naughtie ground receiueth the word preached with ioy a reprobate often desireth them whom he thinketh to be the children of god to pray for him exod as pharao desired aaron amp moses to pray to god for him act so did simon magus desire peter to pray that none of the things which hee had spoken against him should come to passe but yet they cannot pray them selues ro because they want the spirit of christ he may shew liking to god ministers he may reuerence them and feare to displease them act thus did simon magus who at phillips preaching beleeued wondered at his miracles and kept company with him mark and herod is saide to feare john knowing that he was a iust man amp holie also he gaue reuerence to him antonius the emperour called pius though hee was n christian euseb lib yet in a general parliament hel at ephesus he made an act in the behalfe of christias that if anie ma should trouble o accuse a christia for being a christian the party accused shuld go free though he were found to bee a christian and the accuse should be punished plin lib epi and plinius secundus gouernour of spaine vnder traianus the emperour when he sawe an innumerable company of christians to be executed being moued with compassion he wrote in their behalfe being no christian vnto traianus to spare them that coulde be charged with no crime and his letter is yet extant hee may bee zealous in the religion which he professeth and fall from that profession as the galathians did gal who after that they had receiued paule as an angell and woulde haue plucked out their eies to haue done him good yet they fell from the doctrine which hee had taught them to iustification by the works of the lawe which flat ouerthroweth iustification by faith alone kin the same appeareth in iehu who was very zealous for god cause and for the defacing of idolatry and thereupon god blessed him in his children yet neuer helesse he was a wicked man amp and followed ha vile sinnes of ieroboam his father pet hose sam after that hee hath sinned hee doth in many things in which he is faultie amende and reforme his life and doth professe great holines outwardly herode hee did manie thinges which john baptist in preaching moued him vnto saule when he was to be chosen king professed great humilitie sam they may represse their vices amp corruptions and so moderate themselues that they breake not out hest as did haman of whom it is written that when he was full of indignation against mardocheus yet he refrained himselfe and herein the elect and the reprobate differ for thess the elect are somewhat reformed in euerie one of their sinnes but the reprobate though hee be amended in manie faults yet some one fault or other he cannot abide to haue it reformed and by that in a vile manner the diuel wholly possesseth him as herode who did manie thinges yet woulde not leaue his brothers wife and no doubt in iudas most of his sinnes in appearance were mortified and yet by couetousnes the diuel possessed him and held him fast chained in bondage vnd him for one sinne is sufficient to him th by it he may bring a man to damnation beside this he may haue the gift of wo king miracles of casting forth diuels of he ling and such like math mat and this power of d ing strange miracles shall be vsed as an e cuse of some of the reprobates in the day iudgement ofrentimes vnto him is giuen the gift of the holie ghost to discharge the mo waightie calling that can bee in anie common wealth and this is meant when go is saide sam to giue saule another heart that is such vertues as were meete for a king a reprobate may haue the word of go much in his mouth and also may be a preacher of the word mat for so prophesying in christ name shall bee vsed as an excuse of reprobates and we know that among the twelue apostles act coloss tim iudas was a reprobate and this may bee well perceiued in the resemblance of tasting which the author to the hebrewes vseth we know that cookes commonlie which are occupied in preparing of banquets haue as much feeling and seeing of the meate as anie other and yet there is none that eateth lesse of it than they for their stomacks are cloied with the smell and tast of it so in like manner it may come to passe that the minister which dresseth and prouideth the spirituall foode may eate the least of it himselfe and so labouring to saue others he may be a reprobate when as a reprobate professeth thus much of the gospel though in deede he be a goate yet hee is taken for one of god sheepe hee is kept in the same pastures and is foulded in the same fould with them ioh he is counted a christian of the children of god amp so he taketh himself to be no doubt because through the dulnes of his heart he cannot trie and examine himself and therfore truely cannot discerne of his estate whether hee be in christ or not and it may be thought that satan is readie with some false perswasion to deceiue him for this is his property that vpon whom god threatneth death there satan is bolde to pronounce life and saluation as on the contrarie to those to whom god pronounceth loue and mercie to those i say he threateneth displeasure and damnation such malice hath he against god children and hereby it commeth to passe that an hypocrite may be in the visible church and obey it in the word and discipline and so bee taken for a true member of christ when as a man in deede regenerate may be excommunicate and end his life before he be receiued againe for this is the end of excommunication corinthian that the flesh that is the part vnregenerate may be destroied and the spirit that is the part regenerate may be kept aliue in the daie of the lord nowe the man in whom is spirite and flesh rom must needes be the child of god because this argueth that he hath the sanctifying spirite of christ againe paule when he biddeth the corinthians to comfort the incestious man corinthian least through the sleight of satan he should be ouerwhelmed of ouermuch heauines giueth man to vnderstand that he might haue ended his life in great extremitie of sorrowe before hee had been visiblie receiued into the church againe though god will neuer adopt any reprobate yet by the adoption of the elect they may receiue profite for they finde he blessing of god to be on them by rea on that they dwell together and haue soci tie with the children of god gen gen amp amp for nohes ake euerie one in his familie is saued in the lood for lots cause the man of zoar are reserued from the fire and god woulde haue spared sodome if there had beene but ten good man in it for rahabs cause her familie and kindred are at libertie in ierico when ioseph was in putiphars house all thinges prospered well sam for samuels cause the israelites were deliuered from the philistines act and for paules cause they which were with him in the ship were preserued and againe a reprobate by meanes of the faith of either of his parents may be within god couenant and so may be made partaker of baptisme one of the seals of the couenant forso god made his couenant with abraham gen that he woulde be not only his god but also the god of his seede after him gal which paule expoundeth not of a fewe but of all nation also he saith manifestly that those children either of whose parents are beleeuers corinthian rom or holie which holines is not inherent in their persons but onely outwarde and it is a spirituall prerogatiue graunted them of god in that he vouchsafeth them to be in his couenant whereby they are distinguished from the wicked and prophane man of the world besides this reprobates haue some prerog atiues of god rom amp gen as that he is patiet towards them that before he will destroy them he vseth many meanes to winne them that they commonly spend all the daies of their liues in prosperitie insomuch that it is saide of them in the psalme psalm that they goe in continuall prosperitie vnto their death and pine not away as the children of god doe pet tim the isaiah but after a certaine time god in his iust iudgement hardeneth their harts blindeth the eies of their minds he maketh their heads giddie with a spirituall drunkennes and by the strength of their inward lusts as also by the effectuall operation of satan they fall to open infidelitie and contempt of god word and so runne headlong to their own damnation and perish finally theodor lib history cap jacob bergom chronicle iulian the apostata was first a man learned and eloquent and professed the religion of christ but afterward he fell and wrote a booke against the religion of christ answered by cyrill and on a time in a battell against the persians was thrust into he bowels with a dart no man then knewe ow which dart he pulled out with his own and and presently bloud followed which s it gushed out he tooke it in his hand and loong it into the aire saying vicisti galilaee icisti o thou galilean meaning christ thou article the conquerour thou article the conquerour thus he ended his daies in blaspheming christ whom he had professed the reason of this apostasie is euident math seede that is not deepely rooted in the earth at the beginning of the yeare springeth vp it is green and bringeth forth leaues and flowers and it may bee some kinde of fruit too when the heate of sommer commeth it parcheth the earth and the corne wanting deepe rooting and therefore wanting moisture withereth away god word is like seede which that it may bring forth fruit vnto euerlasting life it must bee first receiued of the ground secondly it must be rooted the receiuing of it is when it pearceth to the heart and the affections take holde of it this rooting is of two sorts the first is when the word rooteth but not with the residue of the affections the second is a deepe and a liuely kind of rooting of the word when the word is receiued into the minde and into the heart the first kind of rooting of the word befalleth to a reprobate who vnderstandeth and reioyceth in the promises of saluation yet hee doth not put any confidence in them he cannot rest in them hee doth not reioice that his name is written in the booke of life hee doth not worke out his saluation with feare amp trembling in a worde his heart is in part softened to reioice at the preaching of the worde of god act psalm yet his heart is not opened as lydias was nor inlarged as dauid saith to imbrace the trueth but the elect hee receiueth the word not only into his mind least it should be onely an imagination but also it is deeply rooted in his heart for thus it commeth to passe that the reprobate falleth away from faith in the day of triall and temptation but the elect can not be changed by this which hath beene saide the professors of christian religion are admonished of two things first philipp pet rom that they vse most painefull diligence in working their saluation in attaining to faith in dying to sinne in liuing to newnes of life and that their harts be neuer at rest till such time as they go beyonde all reprobates in the profession of christ iesus seest thou howe farre a reprobate may goe presse on the straite gate with maine and might with all violence lay hold on the kingdome of heauen shall herode feare and reuerence john baptist and heare him gladly and wilt thou neglect the ministers and the preaching of the worde shall pharao confesse his sinne nay shall sathan beleeue and tremble and wilt not thou bewaile and lament thy sinnes and thy wicked conuersation it behoueth thee to feare and take heede least wicked man and the diuel himselfe rise in iudgement and condemne thy life for if thou shalt come short of the dueties of a reprobate and doe not goe beyonde him in the profession of the gospell sure it is thou must looke for the reward of a reprobate the second thing is that the professor of the gospell corinthian psalm amp ver diligently try and examine himselfe whether hee is in the state of damnation or in the state of grace whether he yet beare the yoke of sathan or is the adopted child of god thou wilt say this neede not thou professest the gospell and article taken for a christian yet marke and consider that this often befalleth reprobates to be esteemed christians and they are often so like them math that none but christ can discerne the sheep from the goates true christians from apparent christians wherefore it behoueth all man that shewe themselues to bee christians to lay aside all pride and all selfeloue and with singlenes of heart to put themselues into the ballance of god word and to make iust triall whether in them repentance faith mortification sanctification ampc giue weight answerable to their outward profession which if they doe let them praise god if not let them with al speed vse the meanes that they may be borne a new to the lord and may be inwardly guided by his holy spirite to giue obedience to his will least in the day of god triall they start aside from him like a broken bowe and fall againe to their first vncleanes to conclude let the most zealous papist that is trie him and his whole estate with a single heart as in the presence of god maiestie and he shal find that for all his profession hee dooth come short of a reprobate or at the least not goe beyond him in these points before named god open their eies that they may see it the ephesians verse elect are they whome god of the good pleasure of his will hath decreed in himselfe to choose to eternall life for the praise of the glorie of his grace for this cause the elect onely are said to haue their names written in apocrypha verse the booke of life whom god electeth them hee calleth in the time appointed for the same purpose this calling of the elect is nothing else but thess verse a singling and a seuering of them out of this vile worlde and the customes thereof to ephesians be citizens of the kingdome of heauen to bee of god housholde to pet verse bee liuing stones in the spirituall temple which is the church of god gal verse the company of predestinate to eternall life and this separation must bee made before the ende of this life for this is the order which god taketh hee will haue all them to be in his kingdome in this life that shall bee in the kingdome of heauen after this life and the time of their calling is termed in scriptures corinthian verse luke verse the day of visitation the day of saluation the time of grace this colloss verse john verse seuering and choosing of the elect out of the worlde is then performed when god by his holy spirite indueth them with true sauing faith a wonderfull gift peculiar to the elect for the better knowing of it there is to be considered first what faith is secondly howe god doth worke it in the hearts of the elect thirdly what degrees there bee of faith fourthly what are the fruits and benefites of faith faith is a wonderfull grace of god by which the elect doe apprehende and apply christ and all his benefites vnto themselues particularly here first it is to bee considered that the verie nature of faith standeth in a certaine power of apprehending amp applying christ this is declared by paule when hee saith coloss verse ye are buried with him through baptisme by whome ye are also risen againe with him by the faith of the power of god who raised him from the deade where it appeareth that faith is made a meanes to communicate christ himselfe his death and buriall and so all other benefites to the beleeuer againe to beleeue in christ and to john verse rom verse receiue or to laie holde on christ are put one for an other by s john which declareth that there is a speciall applying of christ euen as we see when a man hath any thing giuen him hee reacheth out his hand and pulleth it to himself and so makes it his owne moreouer faith is called gal verse the putting on of christ which cannot bee vnlesse christs righteousnes bee specially applyed to the heart as the garment to the backe when it is put on lastly this may appeare in that faith is called john verse the eating and drink of christ for there is no eating of meate that nourisheth but first it must bee tasted and chawed in the mouth then it must be conueyed into the stomack and there digested lastly it is to be applied to the partes of th body that are to bee nourished and paul praieth for the ephesians that christ ephesians verse ma dwell in their hearts by faith which plainly importeth this apprehending and applying of christ i adde further that faith is a wonderfull grace of god which may appear first in that paule calleth it column the faith of god power because the power of god is especially seene in the begetting of faith secondly experience sheweth it to bee a wonderfull gift of god when a man neither seeth nor feeleth his sinnes then to say he beleeueth in god mercie it is an easie matter but when a man shall feele his heart pressed downe with the weight of his sinnes and the anger of god for them then to applie god free mercie to his owne soule it is a most hard matter for then it is the propertie of the cursed nature of man to blaspheme god and to dispaire of mercie iudas who no doubt often preached mercy and redemption by christ in the security of his hart when god hand was vpon him and the lorde made him see the vilenes of his treachery hee coulde not comfort himselfe in christ if one woulde haue giuen him ten thousand worlds but in an hellish horror of conscience hanged him selfe desperately which sheweth what a wonderfull harde thing it is at the same instant when a man is touched for his sinnes then to apply god mercie to himselfe yet a true christian by the power of faith can doe this as it may appeare in dauid psalm verse in the daie of my trouble saith he i sought the lorde my sore ranne and ceased not in the night my soule refused comfort i did thinke vpon god and was troubled i praied and my spirite was full of anguish and hee addeth the worde selah a note of some wonderfull thing psalm verse againe he being almost in the gulfes of hell euen then cried to the lord for help iob saith iob verse if god should destroy him yet he would for all that beleeue in him still vndoubtedly strang is the bad of faith knitting christ and his members together that the anguish of spirite cannot and the strokes of god hand doe not vnloose this apprehending of christ is not done by anie corporall touching of him but spirituallie by assurance which is when the elect are perswaded in their harts by the holie ghost of the forgiuenesse of their owne sinnes and of god infinite mercie towards them in iesus christ according to that of corinthian verse paul nowe we haue receiued not the spirit of the word but the spirit which is of god that wee might know the things which are giuen vs of god the things which the spirit of god maketh knowen to the faithfull particularlie are their iustification adoption sanctification eternall life and thus when anie are perswaded of these things concerning themselues they doe in their heartes distinctlie applie and appropriate christ and his benefites to them selues the manner that god vseth in the begetting of faith is this first he prepareth the heart that it maie be capable of faith secondlie he causeth faith by little and little to spring and to breed in the heart the preparation of the heart is by humbling and softening of it and to the doing of this there are foure things requisite the first of them is the knowledge of the word of god both of the lawe and of the gospell without the which there can bee no faith according to that saying of esaiah esai verse by his knowledge shall my righteous servant iustifie manie and that of john ioh this is eternall life that they knowe thee to bee the onely verie god and whome thou haste sent iesus christ the iob ro onelie ordinarie meanes to attaine faith by is the word preached which must bee heard remembred practised and continuallie hid in the heart the least measure of knowledge without which a man cannot haue faith is the knowledge of elements or the fundamentall doctrines of a christian religion a fundamentall doctrine is that which being once denied all religion and all obtaining of saluation is ouerthrowen this knowledge hath a generall faith going with it which is an assent of the heart to the knowne truth of god word this faith when it is growen vp to some great measure it is called the coloss ver rom full assurance of vnderstanding and it is to be seene in the martyrs who maintained god truth against the persecutions of the false church vnto death although both elect and reprobate may be enlightened to know the word of god yet the elect in this thing goe farre beyond all reprobates for it is speciallie said of the ioh eze esay psalm psalm apo ioh that god is their schole master that he softeneth their stonie heartes amp maketh them pliable that hee draweth them that he openeth their senses heartes eares vnderstandinges that the holie ghost is their anoyntment and their eye salue to cleare the eies of their minde to conteine the misteries of god word and the difference of illumination in them is threefolde first the knowledge which the reprobate hath concerning the kingdom of heauen is onelie a generall amp confused knowledge but the knowledge of the elect is pure certaine sure distinct and particular for philipp it is ioined with a feeling and inwarde experience of the thing knowne though indeede the minde of man is able to conceiue more than anie christian heart can feele and this is to bee seene in gal cum rom amp ro cum ro paul who vseth not onelie to deliuer the pointes of god word in generall manner but also setteth them downe speciallie in his owne experience so that the enlightning of the reprobate may be compared to the sight of the blind man who sawe man walking like vnto trees that is in motion like man but informe like trees and the elect are like the same blind man who afterward sawe man a far off cleerely secondlie the knowledge of the wicked corinthian amp puffeth them vp but the knowledge of the godlie humbleth them lastlie the elect besides the knowledge of god word haue psalm tim tit a free amp franke heart to performe it in their liues and conuersations which no reprobate can haue for their illumination is not ioyned with true and sincere obedience by this it is easie to discerne of the illumination of anabaptistes or familistes and manie other which brag of the spirit the second is the sight of sinne arising of the knowledge of the lawe to this ieremie exhorteth the iewes of his time saying ier know thine iniquitie for thou hast rebelled against the lord thy god ampc the chiefe cause of the sight of sinne is christ by his holie spirit luke ioh who detecteth the thoughts of manie harts and iudgeth the world of sinne the manner of seeing our sinnes must be to knowe them particularlie for the vilest wretch in the world can generallie and confusedlie saie he is a sinner but that the sight of sin may be effectuall to saluation it must bee more speciall and distinct euen in particular sins so that a man may saie with dauid ps my sins haue taken such holde of me that i am not able to looke vp they are more in number then the haires of mine heade therefore my heart hath failed me againe a man must not barely see his particular sins but hee must also see the circumstances of them as namely the feareful curses and iudgements of god which accompanie euerie sinne for the consciences of many tell them of their sinnes in particular yet they cannot bee humbled for them and leaue them because they haue not seene that vgly taile of the curse of god that euerie sinne draweth after it the meanes to attaine to the sight of sin is by a diligent examination of a mans owne self this was the practise of the children of israell in affliction iames verse let vs trie saie they and search our waies and turne again to the lord and dauid giueth the same counsell to saules courtiers psalm verse tremble and sinne not examine your owne heart on your bed and bee still this examination must bee made by the commandements of the lawe but specially by the tenth which ransacketh the heart to the verie quicke and was the meanes of paules conuersion for he beeing a proude pharisee rom verse this commaundement shewed him some sinnes which otherwise hee had not knowen and it killed him that is it humbled him if so be it that after examination a man cannot finde out his sinnes as no man shall finde out all his sinnes for iere verse the heart of man is a vast gulf of sinne without either bottome or banke and hath infinite hidden corruptions in it then hee must in a godly iealousie suspect himselfe of his vnknowen sinnes as dauid did saying psalm verse who can vnderstande his faultes cleanse mee from my secrete faults and as paule did corinthian verse i know nothing by my selfe yet am i not thereby iustified and good reason it is why man should suspect themselues of those sinnes which as yet they neuer saw in themselues luke verse for that which is highlie esteemed amongst man is abhomination in the sight of god and the verie iob verse angels are not clean in his sight the third is a sorrow for sinne which is a paine and pricking in the heart arising of the feeling of the displeasure of god and of the iust damnation which followeth after sinne this was in the act iewes after peters first sermon and in habba verse habacucke at the hearing of god iudgments when i heard saith he my bellie trembled my lips shooke at the voice rottennes entred into my bones and i trembled in my selfe that i might rest in the daie of trouble this sorrow is called the rom verse spirite of bondage to feare because whe the spirit hath made a ma see his sins he seeth further the curse of the law amp so he finds himselfe to be in bondage vnder satan hel death damnatio at which most terrible sight his heart is smitten with feare and trembling through the consideration of his hellish and damnable estate this sorrowe if it continue and increase to some great measure hath certain symptomes in the bodie iob verse as burning heat lame amp osea rowling of the intrals psalm verse a pining and fainting of the solide partes in the feeling of this sorrow three things are to be obserued the first all man must look that it be seriously amp soundly wrought in their hearts for looke as man vse to break hard stones into many small pieces and into dust so must this feeling of god anger for sinne bruse the heart of a poore sinner and bring it to nothing and that this may so be sorrow is not to be felt for a brunt but very often before the ende of a mans life the godly man psalm verse from his youth suffereth the terror of god iacob wrestling with the angel gets the victory of him gen verse but yet hee is faine to goe halting to his graue and trale one of his loines after him continually exo zach the paschal lamb was neuer eaten without sowre hearbes to signifie that they which will bee free from the wrath of god by iesus christ must feele continually the smart of their owne sinnes the second all man must take heede least when they are touched for their sinnes they besnare their own consciences for if the sorrow be somewhat ouer sharpe they shall see themselues euen brought to the gates of hell and to feele the pangues of death and when a man is in this perplexitie he shall finde it a most hard matter to be freed from it without the maruelous power and strength of christ iesus who onely is able to helpe him and comfort him yes many when they are once plunged in this distresse and anguish of soule shall neuer escape it as may appear in caine saul achitophel iudas and now of late in john hoffmeister a monke amp latomus who for the space of certaine daies neuer left crying that hee was damned because that hee had wilfully persecuted the gospell of christ and so he ended his life therefore most worthie is paules counsell for the moderating of this sorrow corinthian verse it is sufficient saith he vnto the incestuous man that hee was rebuked of manie so that now contrariwise ye ought rather to forgiue him and comfort him lest he shoulde be swallowed vp of ouermuch heauines and further hee giueth another reason which followeth lest sathan should circumuent vs for we are not ignorant of his enterprise and indeed como experiece sheweth the same that whe any man is most weak then satha most of all bestirreth himselfe to worke his cofusion the third is that all me which are hubled haue not like measure of sorrow but some more some lesse iob felt the hand of god in exceding great measure whe he cried iob verse o that my grief were well weied amp my miseries were laid together in the ballance for it would be now heauier then the sand of the sea therefore my words are now swallowed vp for the arrowes of the almightie are in me and the venome thereof doth drinke vp my spirite and the terror of god fight against me the same did ezechia when on his death bed he said esai verse he brake al my bones like a lion and like a crane or a swallow so did i chatter i did mourne like a doue ampc contrariwise the thiefe vpon the crosse and lydia in her conuersion neuer felt any such measure of grief for it is said of her that god act verse opened hir heart to be attentiue to that which paule spake amp presently after she intertained paul and silas cheerefully in hir house which she coulde not haue done if shee had beene pressed downe with any great measure of sorrowe neither are any to dislike themselues because they are not so much humbled as they see some others for god in great wisedome giueth to euery one which are to bee saued that which is conuenient for their estate and it is often seene in a festred sore that the corruption is let out as well with the pricking of a small pin as with the wide lance of a raser the fourth thing in true humiliation is an holy desperation which is when a man is wholly out of all hope euer to attaine saluation by any strength or goodnes of his owne speaking and thinking more vilely of himselfe then any other can doe and heartily acknowledging himselfe to haue deserued not one onely but euen tenne thousand damnations in hell fire with the diuell and all his angels this was in paule when hee said of himselfe that he was the chiefe of all sinners this was in daniell when in the name of the people of israell he praied and said daniel verse o lorde righteousnes belongeth vnto thee and to vs open shame as appeareth this daie ampc lastly the same was in the prodigall childe who saide luke cerse father i haue sinned against heauen and against thee and i am no more worthie to bee called thy son many are of opinion that this sorrow for sin is nothing else but a melancholike passion but in trueth the thing is farre otherwise as may appeare in the example of dauid who by all coniectures was least troubled sam ver with melancholie and yet neuer any tasted more deepelie of the sorrow and feeling of god anger for sinne then hee did as the booke of psalmes declareth and if anie desire to knowe the difference they are to bee discerned thus sorrow for sinne maie be where health reason senses memorie and all are sound but melancholike passions are where the body is vnsound and the reason senses memorie dulled amp troubled secondlie sorrow for sinne is not cured by any phisicke but onelie by the sprinkling of the bloud of iesus christ melancholike passions are remoued by physicke diet musicke and such like thirdlie sorrowe for sinne riseth of the anger of god that woundeth amp pearceth the conscience but melancholike passions rise onelie of meere imaginations stronglie conceiued in the braine lastlie these passions are long in breeding and come by little and little but the sorrow for sinne vsuallie commeth on a sudden as lightning into a house and yet howsoeuer they are differing it must be acknowledged that they may both concurre together so that the same man which is troubled with melancholie maie feele also the anger of god for sinne thus it appeareth how god maketh the hart fit to receiue faith in the next place it is to be considered howe the lord causeth faith to spring and to breed in the humbled hart for the effecting of this so blessed a worke god worketh foure things in the hart first when a man is seriously humbled vnder the burden of his sinne the lord by his spirit makes him lift vp himselfe to consider amp to ponder most diligentlie the great mercie of god offered vnto him in christ iesus after the consideration of god mercie in christ he commes in the second place to see feele and from his heart to acknowledge himselfe to stande in neede of christ and to stand in neede of euerie drop of his most pretious bloude thirdlie the lorde stirreth vp in his heart a vehement desire and longing after christ and his merites this desire is compared to reu verse isay luke thirst which is not onelie the feeling of the drines of the stomacke but also a vehement appetite after drinke and dauid fitlie expresseth it when he saith i stretched foorth my psalm ver prayer for the pardon of sinne handes vnto thee my soule desireth after thee as the thirstie land lastlie after this desire he beginnes to praie not for anie worldly benefite but onelie for the forgiuenesse of his sinnes crying with the poore publican o god be merciful to me a sinner now this praier it is made not for one day onelie but continuallie from daie to daie not with the lippes but with greater sighes amp groanes of the heart then that they can be expressed with the tongue nowe after these desires and prayers for god mercie ariseth in the heart a liuelie assurance of the forgiuenesse of sinne for god who cannot lie hath made his promise math esay knocke it shall bee opened and againe before they call i will aunswere and while they speake i will heare therefore when an humbled sinner commes crying amp knocking at his mercie gate for the forgiuenesse of sinne either then or shortlie after the lord worketh in his hart a liuelie assurance thereof and re oh whereas hee thirsted in his hart being scorched with the heate of god displeasure beating vpon his conscience christ iesus giueth him to drink of the well of the water of life freelie amp hauing dronken thereof he shall neuer be more a thirst but shall haue in him a fountaine of water springing vp into euerlasting life for the better vnderstanding of this that god worketh sowing faith in the hart of man after this manner it must bee obserued that a sinner is compared luke math to a sicke man oft in the scriptures and therefore that the curing of a disease fitly resembleth the curing of sinne a man that hath a disease or sore in his bodie before hee can bee cured of it hee must see it feele paine of it and be in a feare lest it bring him into danger of death after this he shall see himselfe to stande in neede of phisick and he longeth till he be with the phisitian when he is once come to him he desireth him of all loues to helpe him amp to shew the best skill he can he will not spare for any cost then he yeeldes himselfe into the phisitians handes perswading himselfe that by god blessing he both can and will helpe him after this he comes to his former health againe on the same manner euerie man is wounded with the deadly wound of sinne at the very heart and he that woulde bee saued and escape damnation must see his sinne bee sorrowfull for it and vtterlie dispaire of his owne strength to attaine saluation thereby furthermore he must see himselfe to stande in neede of christ the good phisition of his soule and long after him and crie vnto him with deepe sighes and grones for mercie after this christ iesus will temper him a plaister of his owne heart bloud which beeing applied he shall finde himselfe reuiued and shall come to the assurance of the forgiuenes of all his sinnes so it was in dauid when he repented of his adulterie and murther first god made him see his sinnes for he saith psalm verse i know mine iniquities and my sinnes are euer before me secondly he felt god anger for his sinnes verse make me saith he to heare ioy and gladnes that the bones which thou hast broken may reioice thirdly hee vtterly dispaired of his owne strength in that he said verse stablish me with thy free spirit signifying therby vnlesse the lord woulde staie him with his glorious power he should run headlog to his own cofusio fourthly he comes to see himselfe stand in great neede of god fauour verse one mercie will not content him hee praieth for the whole innumerable multitude of his mercies to bee bestowed on him to doe away his iniquities fiftly his desire and his praier for the forgiuenes of his sin are set down in the whole psalme and in his praier hee gathereth some comfort and assurance of god mercie towardes himselfe in that he saith the sacrifices of god are a contrite spirit verse a contrite and broken heart o god thou wilt not despise there are diverse degrees and measures of this vnfained faith according as there be diverse degrees of christians some revelation verse gal verse are yet in the wombe and haue their mother the church traueling of them some corinthian verse are new borne babes feeding on the milk of the word some are ephesians verse perfect man in christ come to the measure of the age of the fulnes of christ the least measure of faith that any christian can haue is compared to the math graine of mustard seede the least of all seedes and to flaxe esai that hath fire in it but so weake that it can neither giue heate nor light but onely maketh a smoake and is called by the name of a math litle faith and it may be thus described when a man of an humble heart doth not yet feele the assurance of the forgiuenes of his owne sinnes and yet hee is perswaded they are pardonable desiring that they might be pardoned and therfore praieth to god that he woulde pardon them and giue him strength to leaue them a litle faith may more plainly be known by considering these foure points first that it is onely in his heart who is humbled for sinne esai verse for the lord dwelleth with him that is of a contrite and humble spirite to receiue the spirite of the humble and to giue life to them that are of a contrite heart secondly it is in a man especially at the time of his conuersion and calling to christ after which hee is to growe from faith to faith thirdly this faith though it be in the hart yet it is not so much felt in the heart this was in dauid at some times psalm verse my god my god why hast thou forsaken me saith he the first wordes my god my god are speeches of faith yet the latter why hast thou forsaken me shewe that then he had no feeling of god mercie a little faith then is in the heart of a man as in the spring time the fruit is in the bud which yet appeareth not but only hath his nature and substance in the bud lastly the beginnings and seed of this faith are three the first is a persuasion that a mans own sins are pardonable this perswasion though it bee not faith yet it is a good preparation to faith for the wicked cut themselues of quite from god mercie in that with cain gen a desire of grace they say their sinnes are greater then that they can be forgiuen the second is a desire of the fauor amp mercy of god in christ amp of the meanes to attaine to that fauour math luke psalm psal amp number this desire is a speciall grace of god and it hath the promise of blessednes and it must be distinguished from that desire which wicked man haue who though they desire life eternal as balam did yet they cannot desire the meanes as faith repentance mortification ampc the third is praier for nothing in this world but onely for the forgiuenes of their sins with great sighes and grones from the bottome of the heart which they are not able to expresse as they feele them nowe this hearty praying and desire for the pardon of sinne can neuer come from the flesh but onely from the spirite who ro stirreth vp these heauenly motions of longing desiring sighing after remission of sinne and all other graces of god which hee bestoweth vpon his children and where the spirit of christ dwelleth there must needs be faith for christ dwelleth in the harts of the faith full by faith therfore as rebecca whe she felt the twins striue in hir wombe though it pained hir yet shee knewe both that she had conceaued and that the children were quicke in hir so they who haue these motions amp holy affections in them before mentioned may assure themselues that the spirit of god dwelleth in them amp cosequently that they haue faith though a weake faith examples of this small faith are euident in the apostles who though math they beleeued that christ was the sauior of the world yet they math luke were ignorant of his death and resurrection which are the chiefe meanes of saluation after his resurrection they were ignorant of his ascention amp of his spiritual kingdome for they dreamed act of an earthly kingdome amp at his death they all fled from him and peter fearefully denied him they being in this estate are not saide to haue no faith but to be of mat litle faith another example we haue in dauid who hauing continued a log space in his two great sins adultery amp murther was admonished therof by nathan the prophet being admonished he cofessed his sins and strait way nathan declared vnto him from the lord the forgiuenes of the yet afterward dauid humbleth himselfe as it appeareth in the psalme and praieth most earnestly for the forgiuenes of those and all other his sins euen as though it had not beene true that they were forgiuen as nathan tolde him the reason is howsoeuer they were remitted before god yet dauid at his first repenting of them felt none assurance in his heart of the forgiuenes of them onely he had a persuasion that they might be pardoned and therefore hee vehemently desired and praied to the lorde to remitte them and to sanctifie him anewe this then beeing the least measure of faith it must be remembred that he who hath not attained to it hath as yet no sauing faith at all the greatest measure of faith is a full perswasion of the mercie of god for it is the strength and ripenes of faith rom verse abraham not weake in faith but beeing strengthned in the faith was fullie perswaded that he who had promised was able to doe it this full assurance is when a man can saie with paul i rom am perswaded that neither life nor death nor angels nor principality nor powers nor thinges present nor thinges to come nor height nor depth nor anie other creature shall bee able to separate vs from the loue of god which is in christ iesus our lord and lest any should think this saying is peculiar to paule the whole church in the caticles vseth the same in effect saying cant verse loue is strong as death iealousie is as cruell as the graue the coals thereof are fierie coals amp a vehement flame much water cannot quench loue neither can the flouds drown it if a man should giue all the substance of his house for loue they would contemne it no christian attaineth to this full assurance at the first but in some continuance of time after that for a long space hee hath kept a good conscience before god and before man and hath had diverse experiences of god loue and fauour towardes him in christ this paul declareth to the romans rom verse in afflictions god sheds abroad his loue in their hearts by the holie ghost which is giuen to them hence ariseth patience from patience commeth experience from experience hope and hope neuer maketh ashamed or disappointeth him of eternall life this is euident in dauids practise psalm verse doubtlesse saith he kindnes and mercie shall followe mee all the daies of my life and i shall liue a long season in the house of the lord marke this his resolute perswasion and consider howe hee came vnto it namely by experience of god fauour at sundry times and after sundrie manners for before he set down this resolution he numbred vp diverse benefites receaued of the lord that psalm he fed him in greene pastures amp led him by the refreshing water of god word that he restoreth him amp leadeth him in the pathes of righteousnes that he strengthneth him in great dangers euen of death and preserueth him that in despight of his enemy hee enriched him with many benefites by meanes of all these mercies of god bestowed on him he came to be perswaded of the continuance of the fauour of god towards him againe dauid said before king saul sam let no mans heart faile him because of goliah thy servant wil go and fight with the philistine and saul saide ver to dauid thou article not able to goe against this philistine to fight with him for thou article but a boy amp he is a man of war from his youth dauid answered he was able to fight with amp to slaie the vncircumcised philistine and the ground of his perswasion was taken from experience for thus he said ver thy servant kept his fathers sheep and there came a lyon and likewise a beare and tooke a sheepe out of the flocke and i went out after him and smote him amp took it out of his mouth and when he arose against me i caught him by the beard and smote him and slewe him ver so thy servant slew both the lion and the beare therefore this vncircumcised philistine shalbe as one of the seeing he hath railed on the host of the liuing god the like proceeding must bee in matters concerning eternall life litle dauid resembleth euery christian goliah and the army of the philistines resembleth sathan and his power hee therefore that will be resolued that he shall be able to ouercome the gates of hell and attaine to life euerlasting must long keep watch amp ward ouer his own hart amp he must fight against his own rebellious flesh and crucifie it yes he must haue experieces of god power stregthning him in many teptatios before he shal be assured of his attaining to the kingdome of heauen thus much concerning faith it self now followe the fruits and benefites of faith by meanes of this speciall faith the elect are truely ephesians vnio with christ ioined vnto christ and haue an heauenly communion and fellowshippe with him and therfore doe ephesians eph corinthian in some measure inwardly feele his holie spirite moouing and stirring in them as rebecca felt the twins to stirre in hir wombe christ is as ephesians the heade in the bodie euerie beleeuer as a member of the same body now as the head giueth sense and motion to the members and the members feele themselues to haue sense and to moue by meanes of the head so doth christ iesus receiue and quicken euerie true beleeuer and by his heauenly power maketh him to doe the good which he doth rom ioh ephe and as from the stocke sappe is deriued to the graft that it may liue and grow and bring foorth fruite in his kinde so doe all the faithfull that are grafted into christ the true vine and as the graft loseth his wilde nature and is chaunged into the nature of the stocke and bringeth forth good fruit so in like manner it is with them that are in christ who by little and little are whollie renewed act from euill to good the elect being thus ioyned vnto christ receiue three wonderfull benefites from him iustification adoption sanctification iustification is when the elect being in themselues rebellious sinners and therefore firebrandes of hell fire and god owne enemy corinthian cor yet by christ they are accepted of the lord as perfectlie pure and righteous before him this iustification is wrought in this maner sinne is that which maketh a man vnrighteous and the childe of wrath and vengeance in sinne there are three things which are hurtfull to man the first is condemnation which commeth of sinne the seconde is the disobedience of the law in sinne the third is the root and fountaine of sinne originall corruption these are three deadly woundes and three running sores in the hearts and consciences of all sinners luke coloss ioh mark now christ iesus is perfectly righteous and in him a sinner may find three inestimable benefits answerable to the three former euils first the suffringes of christ vpon the crosse sufficient for all mens sinnes secondly the obedience of christ in fulfilling the law thirdly the perfect holines of the humane nature of christ these are three soueraigne medicins to heale all wounded consciences and they are as three running streames of liuing water to bathe and to supple the bruised and contrite heart coloss gal ephe now commeth faith and first laieth hold of the sufferinges of christ and so a sinner is freed from the punishment and guilt of sinne and from eternall damnation and thus the first deadly wounde is cured rom mat philipp isaiah againe faith laieth hold of the perfect obedience of christ in fulfilling the lawe amp thus the second wound is cured rom ioh thirdly faith applieth the holines of christs humane nature to the sinner amp then his nature is accepted of god as perfectly sanctified and so his third deadly wound is cured thus a sinner is made righteous by the righteousnes of christ imputed to him from true iustification proceede rom reconsiliation manie other benefits and they are either outward or inward outwarde benefites are three the corinthian first is reconciliation by which a man iustified is perfectly reconciled to god because his sinne is done awaie and he is arrayed with the perfect righteousnes of christ the corinthian heb sa sam afflictions onelie chastisments second is that afflictions to the faithfull are no punishments for sin but only fatherly and louing chastisements for the guilt and punishment of sinne was borne of christ now therefore if a christian bee afflicted it is no punishment for then god shoulde punish one fault twise once in christ and the seconde time vpon the christian which thing doth not agree with his iustice it remaineth therefore that afflictions are only corrections in the faithfull the third benefite is that the man iustified doth mat apocrypha amp deserue and merite at god hands the kingdome of heauen for being made perfectly righteous in christ he must needs merite eternall life in and by christ and therefore paul called it the iustification of life rom inward benefites proceeding from iustification are those which are inwardlie felt in the hart and serue for the better assurance of iustification and they are principallie fiue the first is peace and quietnes of conscience as al man naturallie in adam are corrupt so all man naturallie haue corrupt and defiled consciences accusing them amp arraigning them before god iudgement for their sinnes in such wise that euerie suspition of death and feare of imminent danger maketh a naturall man stand agast at his wits end knowing not what to doe heb rom ro but by faith in christ the christian is perswaded of remission of his sins and so the disquietnes of his conscience is appeased and hee hath an inwarde peace in all extremities which cannot be taken from him the slumbring amp dead conscience is much like to the good conscience pacified amp manie through ignorance take the one for the other but they maie be seuered and discerned thus first let the beleeuing christian examine himselfe whether his conscience was afflicted with the sense of god iudgements and pressed downe with the burden of his sinne before hee came to that quietnes for then he may be in good hope that it was the spirit of god who brought that peace because god hath promised ioh esay that he will dwell with the humble and contrite to reuiue and quicken them but if hee haue alwayes had that peace from the beginning of his dayes he maie easilie deceiue himselfe by taking the numnesse and securitie of a defiled conscience for true peace of coscience secondly let him search from whence this peace of his conscience proceedeth rom heb for if it come from anie thing else but from the certaintie of the remission of sinne it is no true peace as manie flattering themselues in sinne and dreaming of a pardon are therevpon quieted and the deuill is readie enough to put this into their mindes but this can bee no true peace thirdlie let him examine himselfe if he haue a care to keepe a good conscience which if hee haue he hath also reciued from the lord a good and a quiet conscience act amp for if god bestowe vpon anie man a gift concerning his saluation he giueth him also a care to keepe it the seconde inwarde benefite is ephesians rom entrance with boldnes into god presence an entrance into god fauour and a perseuerance in it which is indeede a wonderfull benefite when a man commeth into fauour with his prince then hee is bolde to come vnto his prince and hee maie haue free accesse vnto his presence and he may sue to his prince for anie benefite or preferment whereof he standeth in neede and may obteine it before anie other so they which are in god fauour by reason that they are freely pardoned and iustified in christ do boldlie approach into god presence and they are readie to aske and sure to obteine anie benefite that is for their good rom amp ioye the third is a spirituall ioy in their harts euen then when they are afflicted because they looke certainely to obtaine the kingdome of heauen the fourth is rom that the loue of god is hed in the hartes of the faithfull by the holie ghost that is that the holie ghost doth make the faithfull verie euidentlie to feele he loue of god towards them and doth as it were fill their harts with it the second maine benefite is ioh gal adoption whereby they which are iustified are also accepted of god as his owne children fro adoption proceed many other benefits first the elect child of god hereby is made a brother to christ secondly he is a king and the kingdom of heauen is his inheritace thirdly he is lord ouer all creatures saue angels fourthly the holie angels minister vnto him for his good they garde him and watch about him fiftlie all things yes greeuous afflictions and sin it selfe turne to his good though in his owne nature it bee neuer so hurtfull heb corinthian amp threfore death which is most terrible vnto him is no entrance into hell but a narow gate to let him into euerlasting life lastly being thus adopted he may look for comfort at god hand answerable to the measure of his afflictio as god hath promised the inward assurance of adoption is by two witnesses the first is our spirit that is an heart and conscience sanctified by the sprinckling of the bloud of christ now because it commeth to passe that the testimonie of our spirit is feeble and weake god of his goodnes hath giuen his owne spirite to bee a fellow witnes with our spirit for the elect haue in themselues the spirit of iesus christ testifying vnto them amp perswading them that they are the adopted children of god ro gal pet for this cause the holie ghost is called the spirit of adoption because it worketh in vs the assurance of our adoption corinthian and it is called a pawne or earnest for as in a bargaine when part of the price is paied in earnest then assurance is made that man will pay the whole so whe the child of god hath receiued thus much fro the holy ghost to be perswaded that he is adopted amp chosen in christ he maie be in good hope and he is alreadie put in good assurance fullie to inioy eternall life in the kingdom of heaue ro ioh coloss corinthian ephe indeed this testimonie is weake in most man amp can scarce bee perceiued because most christians though they may be old in respect of yers yet they are babes in christ amp not yet come to a perfect grouth amp may find in themselues great strength of sin and the graces of god to be in small measure in the and again the children of god being most distressed as in time of triall amp in the houre of death then the inward working of the holy ghost is felt most euidently but a reprobate cannot haue this testimonie at al though in deede a man flattereth himselfe and the deuill imitating the spirit of god doth vsuallie perswade carnall man and hypocrites that they shall bee saued but that deuilish illusion and the testimonie of the spirite may bee discerned by two notes the first is heartie and feruent prayer to god in the name of christ for the same spirite that testifieth to vs that wee are the adopted children of god doth also make vs crie that is feruentlie with grones and sighes filling heauen amp earth pray to god now this heartie feruent and loud crying in the eares of god can the deuill giue to no hypocrite for it is the speciall marke of the spirite of god the other note is that they which haue the speciall testimonie fro the spirite of god haue also in their harts the same affections to god which children haue to their father namelie loue feare reuerence obedience thankefulnes for they call not vpon god as vpon a terrible iudge but they cry father father and these affections they haue not whome sathan illudeth with a phantasticall imagination of their saluation for it may bee that through hypocrisie or through custome they may call god father but in truth they cannot doe it the elect beeing thus assured of their adoptio amp iustificatio are indued with hope rom amp corinthian hebr by which they looke patiently for the accomplishing of all good things which god hath begunne in them and therefore they can vndergoe all crosses and afflictions with a quiet and contented minde because they knowe that the time will come when they shall haue full redemption from all euils this was thess rom the pat ence of paules hope whe he said that nothing in the world could seuer him from the loue of god in christ and like to this was the patience of policarpe amp of ignatius who when he was codemned and iudged to be throwne to wilde beast and now heard the lyons roring he boldly amp yet patiently said i am the wheate of christ i shalbe ground with the teeth of wild beast that i may be founde good breade also the same was the patience of the blessed martir saint lawrence who like a meeke lambe suffred himself to be tormented on a fiery gridiron and when he had beene pressed downe with fire pikes for a great space in the mightie spirit of god spake vnto the emperor that caused him thus to be tormeted on this wise the third maine benefit is act psalm eze psalm inward sanctification by which a christian in his mind in his will and in his affections is freed from the bondage and tyrannie of sin amp sathan and is by litle and litle inabled through the spirit of christ to desire amp approue that which is good amp to walke in it and it hath two parts gal column the first is mortification when the power of sin is continually weakned consumed amp diminished ephesians corinthian the second is vi ificatio by which inherent righteousnes is really put into the amp afterward is cotinually increased this sanctification is wrought in al christians after this manner after that they are ioined to christ and made misticallie bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh christ worketh in them effectually by his holy spirite and his workes are principallie three first ro column amp he causeth his owne death to worke effectuallie the death of all sinne and to kill the power of the flesh for it is as a corrasiue which being applied to the part affected eateth out the venime and corruption and so the death of christ by faith applyed fretteth out and consumeth the concupiscence amp the corruption of the whole man viuificatio in the first resurrection secondly the buriall of christ is the buriall of sinne as it were in a graue phi rom thirdly his resurrectio sendeth a quickning power into them amp to make them rise out of their sinne in which they were dead and buried to worke righteousnes amp to liue in holines of life lazarus bodie lay foure daies and stancke in the graue yet christ raised it and gaue him life againe and made him do the same works that liuing me do so also christ dealeth with the soules of the faithfull they rotte and stincke in their sinnes and would perish in them if they were left alone but christ putteth a heauenlie life into them amp maketh them actiue and liuely to doe the will of god in the workes of christianitie and in the works of their callings and this sanctification is throughout the whole ma in the spirit soule and mind thes and here the spirit signifieth the mind and memorie the soule the will and affections the sanctification of the minde is the enlightning of it with the true knowledge of god word it is of two sortes either sprituall vnderstanding or spirituall wisedome spirituall vnderstanding is a generall conceiuing of euerie thing that is to be done or not to bee done out of god word spiritual wisdome is a worthie grace of god by which a man is able to vnderstand out of god word what is to be done or not to be done in any particular thing or action according to the circumstances of person time place ampc both these are in euery christian otherwise paul would neuer haue praied for the colossians column that they might bee fulfilled with knowledge of god will in all wisedome amp spirituall vnderstanding in both these excelled dauid who testified of himself that god psalm word was a lanterne to his feete and a light to his path and that verse god by his commandements had made him wiser then his enimies that he had more vnderstanding then all his teachers because god testimonies were his meditations that hee vnderstoode more then the auncient because he kept god precepts the properties of the mind enlightened are speciallie two the first is that by it a christian sees his owne blindnes ignorance vanitie as appeareth in dauid who being a prophet of god yet prayed open mine eyes o lord that i may see the wonders of thy law and hence it is that the godly so much bewailes the blindnes of the minds cotrariwise the wicked ioh man in the middest of his blindnesse thinkes himselfe to see the second is that it runneth and is occupied in a continual meditation of god word so dauid saith the psalm righteous mas delight is in the law of the lord amp in his law doth he meditate day and night the memorie also is sanctified in that it can both keepe and remember that which is good and agreeable to god will whereas naturallie it best remembreth lewdnes amp wickednes amp vanitie this holie memorie was in dauid psalm ver i haue hid thy promises in mine hart that i might not sinne against thee and marie luke kept all the sayings of christ amp pondered the in hir hart and to the exercise of this memorie salomon hath a good lesson my son hearken vnto my words incline thine eares vnto my sayings pro let them not depart from thine eyes but keepe them in the midst of thine hart furthermore the will of a christian is renewed amp purified by christ which appeareth in that it is so far foorth freed from sin that it can wil amp choose that which is good and acceptable to god amp refuse that which is euill according to that of paul phi it is god which worketh in you the will amp the deede euen of his good pleasure now if a man be considered naturally he can neither will nor performe that which is good but onely that which is euill iob ephe luke for he is sold vnder sinne as the oxe or the asse amp committeth iniquitie as the fish draweth in water yes he is in bondage vnder sathan who inspireth his minde with vile motions amp boweth his will affections and the members of his bodie to his cursed will so that for his life he is not able to do anie thing but sinne amp rebell against god and it must be remembred that although the christian mans will be freed from the bondage of sinne in this life yet it shall not be free fro the power of sin vntil the life to come for paul that worthie saint saith of himselfe being regenerat that he was carnall and sold vnder sin sanctified affections are knowen by this that they ro are moued and inclined to that which is good to imbrace it amp are not comonlie affected and stirred with that which is euill vnlesse it be to eschew it examples hereof are these which follow ro to reioyce with the that reioice and to weepe with the that weepe luke to reioice because a mans name is writte in heauen ps to desire god presence amp fauour as the drie land desireth water isaiah to feare and tremble at god word psalm to long and to faint after the places where god is worshipped pet ps to be vexed in soule from daie to daie in seeing amp hearing the unlawful deedes of man amp to shed river of teares because man breake god commandements ro in feruencie of spirite to serue the lord coloss to put on the bowels of compassion towards the miseries of man ephesians to be angrie and sinne not corinthian to sorrow for the displeasing of god ioh to loue the brother in christ psalm to admire at the word of god verse to loue god commandments aboue gold mat to admire at the graces of god in others psalm in feare to serue god and to reioice in trembling act to walke in the feare of god and to be filled with the ioie of the holie ghost pet to bee heauie through manifold temptations pe to reioice in being partaker of the sufferings of christ psalm to waite on the lord to reioice in him amp to trust in his holie name ro to waite for the full redemption corinthian ver to sigh desiring to enioie eternall life psalm to loue the habitation of god house amp the place where his honor dwelleth philipp to esteeme al things as losse amp dong in respect of christ but among al these sanctified affections there are foure speciallie to be marked the first is a zeale for god glorie by which a christian is thus affected that rather then god shall loose his glorie he is content to haue his own soule damned as it was with moses who feared least god should loose his glorie if he did vtterlie destroy the israelits for their idolatry whom he had chosen to be his people amp therefore in this respect praied vnto the lord exo therefore nowe if thou pardon their sinne thy mercie shall appeare but if thou wilt not i pray thee rase me out of the booke which thou hast written rom and paul could haue wished with all his hart to bee cut off from all fellowship with christ and to bee giuen vp to eternal destructio for his country man the iewes amp for god glory speciallie some may say this affection is not comon to all but particular to such as are led with such an affection as these holie man were led amp which haue their harts so pearced amp kindled with diuine loue and so rauished with the same out of themselues that they forget al other things yes themselues hauing nothing before their eyes but god and his glorie to this i answere that this affectio is comon to al though the measure of it be diverse in some more in some lesse which appeareth in that our sauiour christ teacheth euery one in his praier which hee made before he craue any other thing either concerning god or himselfe to pray that god name may be sanctified for by this all christians are taught that they are to ouerpasse all considerations of themselues their owne pleasure and profit their saluation or damnation and with an heartie affection to seeke after the glorie of god in all their doinges that as god glorie is most deare vnto himselfe so it may appeare also that it is most deare vnto them if any think it strange that moses paule or any other shoulde bee content to fall into miserie to loose their liues and to be cast into eternall perdition in hell fire with reprobate and damned spirites rather then god honor shoulde bee turned into dishonor and blasphemie let them consider that wonderful is the power of true loue corinthian ver which makes all things easie cant ver which is as strong as the graue that ouercomes all and was neuer yet ouercome which is as a flaming fire that a whole sea of water cannot quench and the loue which these man had to god did so rauish them that they felt no feare of hell fire the second affection is the feare of god a most excellent and wonderfull grace of god salomon eccle matcheth it yes and preferreth it too before al things in this world making it the end of all without it a man cannot be wise it is the first steppe to wisedome prou in it is assured strength also it is a welspring of life to eschewe the snares of death the churches of iudaea being in peace were edified and walked in the act feare of god and were aboundantly filled with the comfort of the holy ghost in this feare of god there be two partes the first is a perswasion in the heart that a man is in god presence and when any by infirmitie forgets god a drawing of himselfe into god presence as it was in dauid psalm i haue saith he set the lorde alwaies before mee for he is at my right hande therefore i shall not slide and this his beeing in the presence of god hee setteth downe most excellently in the psalme gen enoch walked with god ge abraham is commaunded to walke before god and to bee vpright the second part of the feare of god is in god presence to stand in awe of him which is when a man takes heede to his waies lest hee offende god this aduise dauid giues to saule counsellers psalm stande in awe and sinne not pharao commanded the midwiues of egypt to kill all the male children of the israelites at the birth they did it not because exo they stoode in awe of god fearing to displease him and hence it is that the esay godly heare god word with feare and trembling the third is the hatred and detestation of sinne specially of a mans owne corruptions wherewith a christian is so turmoiled that in regarde of them and for no other cause he most heartily desireth to be foorth of this most miserable worlde that hee may be disburdened of his sinne and leaue off to displease god paule feeles in himselfe a huge masse of deadlie corruption it makes him deeme himselfe most miserable and to mourn because he was not deliuered fro it saying ro oh miserable man that i am who shall deliuer me from this bodie of death againe it is sin that makes the church coplain that cant she is black that the sun hath looked vpo hir amp therfore she cries revelation come lord iesus come quickly the fourth is ioy of heart in consideration of the nearenes or presence of the terrible day of iudgement the luke reprobate either trembleth at the consideration of the daie of iudgement or else in the securitie of his heart hee regardeth it not and when hee shall see the signes of the comming of christ tim corinthian his heart shall faile him for verie feare and he shall luke call the hilles to fall vpon him but contrariwise the faithfull loue the second comming of christ and therefore wait and long for it and when they shall see the signes of it they shall lift vp their heads because the ful accomplishment of their redemption is at hand the sanctification of the bodie is when all the members of it are carefully preserued from being meanes to execute any sin and are made the instruments of righteousnes and holines so paule praied for the thessalonians that they might knowe howe to possesse their vessels in holines and in honour and not in the lust of concupiscence as the gentiles doe which know not god and iob iob ver made a couenant with his eies not to looke on a woman in whose example it appeareth how euery member is to be kept pure and holie if any humbled christian finde not this measure of sanctification in himselfe yet let him not bee discouraged for if any man haue a rom ver willingnes amp a desire to obey god commandements he hath the spirit and he who hath the spirit is in christ and he who is in christ shall neuer see damnation and though he faile greatly in the action of obedience yet god will accept his affection to obey as obedience acceptable to him god will approue of thee for his owne worke which he hath wrought in thee and not reiect thee for thine from sanctification ariseth repentance for a man cannot hate his owne sinnes before he be sanctified and he cannot truely repent for them before hee hate them repentance is when a man act turnes to god amp brings forth fruites worthie amendment of life this turning vnto god hath two parts the first a purpose and resolution of heart neuer to sinne any more but to leade a new life this was in dauid psalm who fully purposed to keepe god commandements and psalm applied his heart to fulfill his statutes vnto the end and vnto this did barnabas exhort the brother at antioch act that with full purpose of heart they would cleaue vnto the lord the second part is an holy labour in mans life and conuersation to purifie and cleanse himselfe from sin of this speaketh john ioh ver and euerie one that hath this hope in him purgeth himselfe euen as hee is pure this did dauid practise as may appeare in that hee saide psalm certainely i haue cleansed my heart in vaine and washed my handes in innocencie if anie maruaile howe repentance followeth sanctification considering it is the first thing of all that the prophets apostles and ministers of god preach vnto the people whome they woulde winne to christ i answere that all other graces are more hidden in the heart whereas repentance is open and sooner appeareth to a mans owne selfe and to the eies of the worlde it is like the budde in the tree which appeareth before the leafe the blossome the fruite and yet in nature it is the last for a man must bee renewed and come to an vtter disliking of his owne sins before hee will turne from them and leaue them by this it may appeare that there is one maner of sinning in the godly and another in the vngodly though they fall both into one sinne a wicked man when he sinneth in his heart he giueth ful consent to the sin but the godly though they fall into the same sinnes with the wicked yet they neuer giue full consent for they are in their minds willes and affections partly regenerate and partly vnregenerate and therefore their willes will partly abhorre that which is euill according as saint paule saith of himselfe ro i delight in the lawe of god according to the inner man but i see an other lawe in my members rebelling against the lawe of my minde and leading mee captiue ampc and that the godlie man neuer giueth full consent to sinne it is euident by three tokens first before hee commeth to doe the sinne hee hath no purpose nor desire to doe it but his purpose and desire is to doe the will of god contrarie to that sinne secondly in the act or doing of the sinne his heart riseth against it yet by the strength of temptation and by the mightie violence of his flesh hee is haled and pulled on to doe wickednesse paule saith of himselfe that hee was solde vnder sinne that is hee was like a slaue who desireth to escape out of his maisters handes and yet is faine in great miserie to serue him thirdly after hee hath sinned hee is sore displeased with himselfe for it and truelie repenteth as math peter before the denying of his maister had no purpose to doe it but rather to die in his cause in the act hee had a striuing with himselfe as appeareth by this that first hee answered faintly i knowe not what thou saist and yet after when the assault of sathan more preuailed he fell to swearing cursing and banning after his fall he repented himselfe and wept bitterly for it all was contrarie in iudas who went to betra e his maister with full intent and purpose for the diuell long tempting him vnto it entred into him that is made him yeelde and resolue himselfe to doe it john afterward when christ was betraied and condemned iudas was not sorrowfull for his sinne with a godly sorrow but in dispaire of mercie hanged himselfe fruites worthy of amendment of life are such fruites as the trees of righteousnes beare namely good workes for the doing of a good worke there be three things requisite first it must proceede from iustifying faith for the worke cannot please god except the person please him and the person cannot please him without this faith secondly it is to bee done in obedience vnto god reuealed word to obeie is better then sacrifice and to hearken is better then the fatte of rams thirdly it is to be referred to god glorie corinthian whether ye eate or drinke saith paule or whatsoeuer ye doe doe all to the glorie of god the speciall workes of christians which they and none but they truly performe are these fiue which follow the first is the good hearing of the worde john iohn my sheepe saith christ heare my voice and followe me and againe he which is of god heareth his voice and this was one note of the faithfull in the primatiue church to assemble to heare the worde this good hearing of the worde is the sauing hearing that bringeth life eternall in this action christians are vsually thus disposed before they come to heare the worde of god they make themselues readie to heare it as the man of berea did act who receaued the worde with all readines this preparation standeth in two points first they disburden themselues of all impedimentes that like vnto runners in a race they may iam psalm be swift to heare these impedimentes are sinne and troubled affections and they come with humble heartes corinthian as fooles that they may become wise secondly they quicken vp themselues and come vnto the assemblies hungring and thirsting after the worde of god as man doe after meate and drinke when they are in hearing god worde their minds are fixed and attentiue onely to that which is spoken as act lydias was thirdly they truly beleue the word of god amp carefully applie it to their owne soul fourthly they feel the liuely power of it in theselues it is as marke salt in them to drawe out their inward corruption it is to them the ephesians sworde of the spirite and as a rom sacrifising knife in the hande of god minister by which their flesh is killed and they are offered vp in a liuing sacrifice to god it is ioh spirite and life to quicken and reuiue their soules that are dead in sin and the reason of this is plaine the word of god preached is as a cuppe of wine the true christian is the lord guest but he hath sauce of his owne he bringeth his suger with him namely his true faith which he tempereth and mingleth with god worde and so it becommeth vnto him as a cuppe of sweete wine and as water of life nowe the hypocrite because hee bringeth no faith with him drinketh of the same but thinketh the wine to bee sowre and tarte and voyde of relishe and in truth it is vnto him as a cuppe of ranke poyson againe act esay they heare the worde of god as in god presence and therefore their hearts are full of feare and trembling and they receiue the worde not thess as from man but as from christ iesus the onely math pet doctor of the church and they regarde not so much the embassadour or his abilitie as the embassy of reconciliation sent from the king of heauen after they haue hearde the worde they are bettered in knowledge and in affection and they psalm remember it and meditate vpon it continuallie that they may frame all their doinges by it worldlie man vse to buie bookes of statutes and to haue them in their houses to reade on that they may knowe howe to auoide daunger of lawe and so the faithfull doe alwaies sette before them god worde and in all their dooinges it is their psalm counseller lest they shoulde come into daunger of god displeasure the second worke is the receauing of the sacraments of baptisme once onely when a man is admitted into the church and of the lord supper often the first sealeth vp to the heart of a christian that he is vnited vnto christ and hath true fellowshippe with him in being fullie iustified before god and inwardly sanctified the second serueth to seale vp in the heart of a christian the continuall growing and increasing of the same graces this thing euerie true beleeuer shall haue often experience of either in or after the receauing of the sacrament and yet it shall not bee so alwaies for sometimes the church being cant brought into christes wine celler shall fall into a sounde and not feele any refreshing there yet the beleeuer is not to bee dismaied if he feele not alwaies comfort presentlie after the sacrament a sicke man feeles no comfort or nourishment when hee eateth meate and yet it preserueth his life so the weake christian though hee feele himselfe not nourishe at the sacrament by christes bodie and bloud yet hee shall see in time that his soule shall be preserued thereby vnto euerlasting life furthermore when a christian feeleth no comforte by the sacrament let him then humble himselfe before the lorde more heartily then euer before confessing his sinnes and praying for increase of grace and then hee shall feele the fruite of the sacrament the third worke is a relieuing of the poore bretheren in christ proceeding of a brotherly kindenesse towardes them this is a speciall woorke not to bee done to all man alike as saint paule saith gal doe good to all man but especiallie to them of the housholde of faith directions for this matter are the faithfull of hierusalem act who were all in one place and had all thinges common act namely in vse and they solde their possessions and goods and parted them to all man as euerie one had neede also the bretheren at corinthian in their extreame pouertie corinthian relieued the churches of macedonia liberallie not onelie according to their power but also straining themselues beyonde their power yes this reliefe must goe further euen to the bestowing of a mans life if neede so require as saint john saith john hereby wee haue perceaued loue that hee laide downe his life for vs therefore wee ought also to laie downe our liues for the bretheren the fourth worke is true praier and saint luke setteth out the faithfull and the children of god by this description act that they call on the name of the lorde as on the contrarie it is saide of the wicked psalm that they call not vpon god psalm the true christian calleth on the lorde in truth for the rom spirite of adoption which is the zach spirite of praier is his schoolemaister to teach him to doe it in praier hee is thus disposed first before hee praieth eccle daniel hee is stricken with some feare and reuerence in regarde of god maiestie for hee considereth that praier is a familiar talking with god secondlie hee is inwardlie touched with a liuelie feeling of his owne wants but especially hee is vexed and grieued at his owne sinne and rebellion and this sense of his miserie is as a spurre to quicken his benummed heart thirdly hee humbleth himselfe before his god and laieth sam open his heart before the lorde shewing a feruent and longing desire to obtaine those thinges of which he findeth an extreame want in himselfe as the prophet dauid did whose psalm amp desire was like the yawning of the drie ground and this proceedeth from rom the spirite of god which stirreth vp groaninges in the heart which a man oftentimes for his life cannot expresse fourthlie when hee maketh his request mark hee doubteth not but by faith hee beleeueth that god will graunt his requestes which hee maketh according to his worde the ground of this perswasion is double first ro christ iesus by whose merites as hee hath obtained remission of sinnes so he looketh to obtaine all things else the john other ground is the comfortable promises of god which he hath made that he will heare them who truely call vpon him fifthlie hee praieth not for a brunt or two but hee continueth in praier and although god seeme not to heare him at the first thess yet hee patiently waiteth on the lord and still calleth vpon him the first worke is to walke in some lawful calling with painefulnesse and vprightnesse so that in performing all the dueties of it a man may keepe a good conscience before god and man thus dauid determined to walke in the gouernement of his house and kingdome psalm i will doe wiselie saith hee in the perfect waie till thou commest to mee i will walke in the vprightnesse of mine heart in the middest of mine house i will sette no wicked thing before mine eies i hate the worke of them that fall awaie it shall not cleaue vnto me this sinceritie of dauids behauiour in his calling made him bold to offer himselfe to be tried not onely by man but much more by the lord god himselfe and to bee punished accordingly psalm psal psalm iudge mee o lorde saith hee for i haue walked in mine innocencie prooue mee o lorde and trie mee examine my reines and mine heart so vpright and cleare was hee in all his doings thus much of faith and the benefites that come by faith nowe followeth the spirituall exercise of a christian in his manifolde temptations which are in this life inseparable companions of grace the reason is because the diuell hateth christ with a deadly hatred and sheweth this hatred in a continuall persecution of his members as saint john saith revelation the dragon was wrothe with the woman and went and made war with the remnant of hir seed which kept the commandementes of god and haue the testimonie of iesus christ now therefore as soone as christ iesus beginneth to shewe anie token of his loue to anie man the deuill contrariwise sheweth foorth his enmitie and stirres vp his fellow champions the flesh and the worlde to war against him for his confusion and furthermore the lord in great wisedome permits temptations to the last ende of a christian mans life deut corinthian to trie his faith to purge him of sinne to humble him and to make him depende of his maiestie to quicken and reuiue the graces of his spirit which otherwise would be dead and decay the temptations of a christian are specially sixe the first is when inwardly in his hart iam he is drawen away and entised by his owne concupiscence vnto anie sinne the christians exercise in temptation is gal fight and battell between the flesh and the spirit and this fighting standeth in foure things first the flesh stirres vp euill thoughtes and desires as a burning furnace continually endeth vp smoke and sparkes of fire and it ggeth a man forward to euill wordes and deeeds according to that of saint marke mark for from within euen from the hart of man proceed euill thoughts adulteries fornications murders theftes couetousnes wickednes deceite vncleannesse a wicked eye backbiting pride folishnes the flesh hindreth and choketh the good motions amp desires of the hart as paul saith ro i see an other law in my members rebelling against the law of my mind and leading me captiue to the law of sinne which is in my members again the same flesh mingleth euerie good motio and desire with some corruptions so that the godlie mislike the best thing they doe esay saith of his owne amp the peoples righteousnes that it is but as a isaiah menstruous cloute reu the prayers of the saintes must be performed with swete odours before they can ascend vp sweete amp sauorie into the nostrilles of god and paul said of himself he did that which he disliked not that he was ouertaken with grosse sins but because when hee was to do his dutie the flesh hindred him that he could rom not do that which he did exactly and soundly according to his wil and desire euen as a man who hath a iorney to go his mind is to dispatch it in all hast yet when he is in his trauel he goes but slowly by reason of a lamenesse in his ioints the spirit on the contrarie kindles in the hart good motions amp desires amp puts a man forward to good words and deeds as it was in dauid gal psalm i will praise the lord saith he who hath giuen me counsell my reines also teach me in the night season the spirit rebuks a man for his evil intents amp desires and represseth the face of them and as it were nips them in the head thus esay describeth the inward motions of the spirit isaiah and thine eares shal heare a word behind thee saying this is the way walke yee in it when thou turnest to the right hand and when thou turnest to the left and saint john saith the spirit ioh iudgeth the world of sinne this was in dauid who when he did any euill his hart smote him sam out of this doctrine issueth a notable difference between the wicked amp the godly in the godly when they are tempred to sin there is a fight between the hart amp the hart that is betwene the hart amp it self in the wicked also there is a fight when they are tempted to sinne but this fight is onely betweene the heart and the conscience the wicked man whatsoeuer hee is hath some knowledge of good and euill and therefore when hee is in doing anie euill his conscience accuseth checketh and controuleth him amp he feeles it stirring in him as if it were some liuing thing that crauled in his body and gnawed vpon his hart and therevpon he is verie often greeued for his sinnes yet for all that hee liketh his sinnes verie well and loueth them and coulde finde in his hart to continue in them for euer so that indeede when hee sinneth hee hath in his hart a striuing and a conflict but that is onlie betweene himselfe and his conscience but the godlie haue an other kinde of battell and conflict for not onelie their consciences pricke them and reproue them for sinne but also their hartes are so renewed that they rise in hatred and detestation of sinne and when they are tempted to euill by their flesh and sathan they feele a luste and desire to doe that which is good the second temptation is a quietnesse in the hart of a christian because hee cannot according to his desire haue fellowshippe with christ iesus hee is exercised in this temptation on this manner cant christ let him see his excellencie amp how he is affected towards him verse then the christian considering this desireth christ and his righteousnes he delighteth himselfe in christ and hath some inioying of his benefits verse then he comes into the assemblie of the church as into god wine celler that in the word and sacraments he may feele a greater measure of the loue of christ but he ver falles loue sicke that is hee becomes troubled in spirit because he cannot eioy the presence of christ in the saide manner as he would ver in this his spirituall sicknes hee first feeles the power of christ supporting him that the spirite bee not quenched and hee ver heares christ as it were whispering in his heart as a man speakes to his friende when hee is comming towardes him a farre off ver after this christ comes neerer but the christian can no otherwise enioy him then a man enioyes the company of his friend who is on the other side of a wall looking at him through the grate or lattesse then his eyes are opened to see the causes why christ so withdrawes himselfe to be his owne securitie and negligence in seeking to christ his slacknes in spirituall exercises as in prayer and thankes giuing the deceiptfulnesse and malice of false teachers then he comes to feele more liuelie his fellowship with christ lastlie he prayeth that christ would continue with him to the end the third temptation is trouble of mind because there is no feeling of christ at all who seemeth to be departed for a time the exercise of a christia in this tentatio is this the fourth temptation is securitie of hart rising of ouermuch delight in the pleasures of the world the exercise of a christian in this temptation is this the first temptation is a fall into some great sin as noah into drunkennes dauid into adulterie and murder peter into the deniall of christ the exercise of a christian in this temptation is this a care to leaue that sin into which he is falle as they which crucified our sauior christ whe they were pricked in their harts at peters sermo they shewed this care in saiing act man amp brother what shal we do to be saued an apologie which is whe a man in the heauines of his hart shall not excuse or defend his sin but cofesse it to the lord amp vtter ly condene himselfe for it acknowledging withal y t there is no way to escape y t wrath of god but by hauing god fre pardo in christ indignation which is an inward anger and fretting against his owne selfe because he was so carelesse in looking to his owne waies peter whe he had denied his maister he wept amp that bitterly which sheweth y t with sorow he had also an anger against himself a feare rising not so much fro the iudgments of god as fro this lest he shold hereafter fall into the same sin againe and by so doing more greeuouslie displease god a desire euer after more carefully to plese god zeale in the seruice of god reuenge vpon himselfe for his former offences for example if a man sin in surfetting and dronkennes if he euer repent hee will bring vnder his corrupt nature by sparing and moderating himselfe the sixt temptation is outward afflictios which the godly in this life must suffer math if any will go after christ he must denie himself take vp his owne crosse amp follow him pet and s peter saith that iudgment begins at god house act and paul that we must enter into the kingdome of heauen through manifold temptations the exercise of a christian in afflictions is this if the afflictions bee for christes cause vnto death then he in more speciall maner is filled with the ioy of the holie ghost and he is then stablished with the greatest measure of the strength of christ that no torment is able to foyle him and to bring him fro christ though the christian should die a thousand times for it according to that of paul philipp to you it is giuen for christ not onelie to beleue in him but also to suffer for his sake and this is grounded vpon the promise of god isaiah whe thou passest through the water i wil be with thee amp through the flouds that they do not ouerflow thee when thou walkest through the very fire thou not be burnt neither shall the flame kindle vpo thee hence ariseth a notable differece betwen the godly amp the wicked in the suffering of afflictions a reprobate the more the lord laieth his hand on him the more hee exod murmureth amp rebelleth against god it is contrary with the true christian none feeleth more the power amp rebellion of sin then he none is more assalted by sathan then he amp often times it cometh to passe that god withdraweth the signes of his fauor from him amp lets him feele his wrath and this is the greatest temptation of all other when a man shall see the lord to be his enimie amp to his thinking to arme himself against him to his destruction as isaiah ezechias did who iob saith that the lord did crash his bones like a lion or as iob saith that the arrowes of the almightie were in him amp the venime thereof drunke vp his spirit amp the terror of god did fight against him yet the true christian when the world the flesh amp the deuill amp god himself too are against him doth euen then most of al rest in the lord amp by faith cleue to him iob though god should destroy me yet would i trust in him saith iob psalm and dauid saith my god my god why hast thou forsaken me when he saith that god had forsaken him it may seeme to be the complaint of a desperate ma not hauing so much as one spark of faith yet then he saith my god my god which words contain a confession proceeding fro true faith so y t in dauid it appeareth that the faithful whe they feele theselues forlorne amp vtterly reiected of god according to y e sense amp iudg ment of y e flesh yet by faith they can apprehend his hidde mercy amp behold it a far off in the glasse of his promise and so they do often shew contrary affectios in their praiers as dauid doth gen iacob when he wrastled with the angel for life amp death neuer gaue ouer amp whe he was foild he wold not cease before the lord had blessed him this his wrastling is a type of the coflicts which the faithful are to haue with y e lord himself who vseth to bring his own children as it were to the field amp he assaileth the with the one hand amp with the other he holdeth them vp that so he may proue amp exercise their faith and for this cause the church psalm is called israel by the name of iacob an exaple may be had in the woman of canaan math first our sauior christ gaue hir faith amp by y t faith she was moued to seeke to him but when she was once come to him he gaue hir three repulses first by saying nothing secondly by denying hir thirdly by calling hir dog thus christ in apperance made shew as though he wold neuer haue granted hir request but she at euery repulse was more instat crying more earnestly vnto him amp she plainly opposed hir self to him amp wold take no denial for such is the nature of true faith wherefore the faithfull when they feele theselues ouerwhelmed with sin turmoiled with coflicts of satan whe they feele y e anger of god offended with the yet they can euen the lift vp their eie lids amp giue a glimps at the brase serpent iesus christ amp can fling theselues into the armes of god mercy amp catch hold of the hand of god buffetting the amp kisse it by these tetatios it coms to pas that a christia though he cannot fall finally fro christ yet he may fall very dangerously fro his former estate first the graces of god may be by his defalt lessned in him else paul wold not haue giuen out these exhortatios thess quench not the spirit ephesians grieue not the holy spirit of god by who ye are sealed vnto the day of redemptio secondly the graces of god may be buried in him amp couered for a time so that he may bee like a man in a traunse who both by his own sense amp by the iudgement of the phisition is take for dead this was the estate of peter who though he cofessed that christ was the son of the liuing lord mat yet he denied him amp forswore him at the voice of a damsel thirdly he may fal againe into the same sin after repentance indeed this is a dangerous fal yet it may befal a true christian otherwise whe as the israelits god people had fallen away fro him by their sins amp idolatries he wold not stil haue offered the mercie isaiah as he doth by his prophets and corinthian paul praieth the corinthians in christs stead that they would be recociled to god who neuertheles had once before bene reconciled to god fourthly he may commit a sinne of presumption which is a fearefull sinne being done wittinglie of knowledge and willinglie and with some wilfulnesse therefore dauid prayed ps keepe thy servant presumptuous sinne and to shewe himselfe to be in danger of it hee prayeth further let them not haue dominion ouer mee lastly hee may fall into dispaire of god mercie for a time and this is a dangerous sinne for he which dispaires makes all the promises of god to bee false and this sinne of all other is most contrarie to true sauing faith in this estate was dauid whe being in trouble hee said psalm this is my death and paul shewes that the incestuous man might haue fallen into desperation corinthian when hee sayth comfort him least hee bee swallowed vp of ouermuch heauinesse and it must bee remembred that the church of rome erreth in this that she teacheth desperation to bee a sinne against the holie ghost this sinne against the holie ghost is a blasphemie spoken against the knowen truth of god worde of a wilfull and obstinate malice but desperation may arise through ignorance of a mans owne estate through horror of conscience for sinne through an often relapse into some sinne through the ouerdeepe consideration of a mans owne vnworthines lastly by abiuration of the truth through compulsion amp feare this befell francis spira who after his apostasie dispaired yet they are much ouerseene that write of him as of a damned creature for first who can tell whether hee dispaired finally or not secondly in the verie middest of his desperation he complained of the hardnes of his heart which made him that he could not praie no doubt then he felt his hardnes of heart and the feeling of corruption in the heart is by some contrarie grace so that he was not quite bereft of al goodnes though he neither felt it then nor shewed it to the beholder the cause why a christia canot fall away fro grace is this after that he is sanctified he receiueth fro god another special grace which may be called corroboratio for he hath in him not only the sanctifying but also the strengthning power of christ therfore paul praieth for the ephesias ephesians that they may be strengthned in the inner ma for the collossias colloss that they might be strengthned with the glorious power of christ and of himself he saith philipp that he is able to do al things through the power of christ that stregthen him psalm dauid saith that god renueth the that fear him as the eagle renueth hir decaied strength iob and iob shewes worthily that they which by preaching of the word are reconciled vnto god are restored againe and gather new strength so that their flesh becomes as the flesh of yong children from hence as from a special cause ariseth patience amp perseuerance vnto the end for when a man is supported by the power of christ hee may be able to beare many crosses patietly with a co ented mind amp perseuer in bearing of it how long so euer the crosse endureth thus much of the estate of a christian in this life now i wil ad some reasons in the way of perswasion to all me but especially to worldlings amp to loose professors of the gospell that they woulde vtterly deenie themselues corinthian amp vse all meanes to become true christias by being made new creatures in christ and tit by leading such a life as may adorne the gospell of christ my first reason is this the man that liueth in this world nor beeing a true christian is farre more vile then the basest creature of all euen the dogge or toade for first he is nothing els but a filthy dunghill of all abhomination and vncleannes the ro stinke whereof hath infected heauen and earth and no perfumes coulde euer delaie it in the nostrils of god but onely the suffering of christ beeing ephesians a sacrifice of a sweet smelling sauour to god wee make it very daintie to come nere a lazar man that is full of botches blaines amp sores but much more are those man to bee abhorred which haue lien many yeares starke ephesians dead in sins and trespasses amp therfore now do nothing els but rot amp stinke in the like vgly lothsome carrions secodly he which is no christia is vnder the power of darknes hauing sathan for his prince corinthian and god and giuing vnto him in token of homage his best partes euen his minde and conscience luke to bee his dwelling place and his whole conuersation is nothing else but a perperuall obedience to sathan if atheists amp worldlings amp carnal gospelers were perswaded of the truth of this as it is most true it would make them howle amp cry though now they liue at ease without feeling any prick of conscience for sinne and if they had but the least sense of it in the worlde it woulde make their flintie hearts to bleede and it woulde make them shedde river of teares but how long shall they continue in this vile estate truely vntill they come to christ awake therefore thou that sleepest and stand vp from the dead and christ shall giue thee light open thine heart to receiue christ and then hee will come amp binde the strong man sathan and cast him out and dwell in thee himselfe thirdly hee which is no christian is in danger of al the iudgements of god so that euery moment some of them may befall him he may perish sodainly by water with the olde world he may bee consumed with fire and brimstone with sodome and gomorrha hee may bee swallowed vp of the earth with core dathan and abyram hee may hang himself with iudas he may haue his braines dashed against the grounde and bee eaten vp of dogs with iesabell he may die in the hardnes of heart with pharao he may dispaire with caine and iudas he may be stricken with sodaine death with ananias and saphira his wife he may be eaten of wormes with herode hee may bee smitten with trembling that he cannot heare god worde with foelix hee may voide his guts at the stoole with arius he may crie at his death that he is damned with latomus he may bee left vnto himselfe to mocke blaspheme and renounce christ with iulian and hee may suffer manie more fearefull iudgements whereof the lord hath deut great store and all tende to the confounding of them which will not be humbled vnder his hand contrariwise the true christian is so farre out of the reach of god iudgements that they cannot hurt him esal christ is a couering and a cloude against the heat and tempest of god iudgementes exo when a mans heart is sprinkled with the bloud of this immaculate lambe all the plagues of god passe ouer him in the destruction of ierusalem the ezec righteous beare a marke in their foreheads and are saued therefore let him that hath regard to his owne safetie become a christian thirdly the man which is no christian is in danger of eternall death and damnation in hell fire and they which fall into this estate it had beene ten thousand folde better for them if they had neuer beene borne thess for they are quite separated from the presence of god and from his glorie al the company they haue is with the diuell and his angels their body and soules are tormented with infinite horrour and anguish arising of the feeling of the whole wrath of god in which as into a bottomlesse sea they are plunged thus they are alwaies dying and yet are neuer deade furthermore the length of this torment must bee considered which greatly aggrauates the paine if a man might be deliuered from the panges of hell when he had suffered them so many yeares as there be droppes in the sea or little sands in the whole earth it were some comfort but after that those yeares be expired there shall come no release but the damned shall continue in shriking yelling and gnashing of teeth enduring the consume heate of god wrath without any ende for euer and euer yes to goe further a wicked man carrieth an hell about him in this life namely an euill conscience which if it bee neuer so litle touched with any of god anger a ma shall feele himselfe to haue euen the panges of hell in his heart nowe therefore all they that woulde escape out of this hellish and damnable estate while they haue time let them pray for the pardon of their sinnes in christ and walke according to the spirite in newnes of life and then they may assure themselues that there is no condemnation can belong to them and it must be alwaies remembred that he which would liue when he is dead must die while he is aliue namely to sinne and againe he which would rise to eternall life in the daie of iudgement must rise from sin before he die vnto newnes of life the fourth reason god hath appointed vnto euerie man that liueth in the church a certaine time of repentaunce and of comming to christ and hee which mispendeth that time and is not made a christian then can neuer bee saued this made our sauiour christ weepe for hierusalem and say luke o if thou hadst knowne at the least in this thy daie those things which belong to thy peace but now are they hidden from thine eies and further signifieth the destruction of hierusalem ver because she knew not the time of hir visitation againe the neglecting of this time is one cause why not one or two but manie luke ver shall seek to enter into the kingdome of heauen and yet shall not be able it is a maruailous thing that they which seek to be saued should perish but the fault is theirs which seeke when it is too late nowe therefore thou secure worldling thy conscience telleth thee that thou hast not yet repented and that thou article not as yet a liuely member of iesus christ and thou knowest further that howsoeuer thou article aliue at this time yet thou hast no lease of thy life god may call thee foorth of this worlde the next yeare the next weeke the next howre yes he may strike thee with sodaine death at this very present and in very truth if thou goest foorth of this world beeing no christian thou goest damned to hell wherefore delaie not one minute of an hower longer but with all speede repent and turne vnto god and bring forth fruites worthie of amendment of life that all thy sinnes may be done away when the day of death or the day of iudgement shal be and doe not thinke with thy selfe that it shall be sufficient to differre thy turning vnto god till the last ende for late repentance is seldome true repentance and he which continueth long in any sinne is in a dangerous case if a man lie long in any disease he will scarce recouer his former health and hee which is growen in the custome of any sin and the sinne is become ripe in him it is a thousand to one he is neuer saued according to that of saint iames iam sinne being perfected bringeth forth death the fift reason eternall life is a thing desired of all man yet none shall be made partakers of it but the true christian and the glorious estate of this life woulde mooue any man to be a christian first of all they which haue eternall life are freed from all pains sickenesses infirmities hunger thirst cold wearines from all sin as anger forgetfulnes ignorance from hell death damnation sathan amp from euery thing that causeth miserie according to that of saint john and reue god will wipe away all teares from their eies amp there shall be no more death neither sorrow neither crying neither shall there be anie more paine for the first things are passed secodly the faithful shall be in the presence of god maiesty in heauen there to behold his face that is his glorie as our sauiour christ saith father ioh i will that they which thou hast giuen me be with me euen where i am that they may beholde my glorie which thou hast giuen me and dauid saith in psalm revelation thy presence is fulnes of ioy and at thy right hand there are pleasures for euermore thirdly they corinthian shall haue such an excellent communion with god that he shalbe vnto them all in all for in the end of the world whe the whole number of the elect is accomplished christ shall present them to his father and as he is mediator he shal cease to be a king a priest a prophet as paule saith corinthian then shall be the ende when he hath deliuered vp the kingdome to god euen the father when he hath put downe all rule al authoritie and power againe among the elect there shall not bee king and subiect father mother child maister servant noble ignoble rich poore liuing dead some will say what then shall there be i answere one glorious and euerlasting god the father the son and the holie ghost shall be in all the elect all that heart can wish and desire man shall not be in darkenesse neither shall they neede the light of the sun moone or starres god himselfe immediately shall be their light revelation as john saith and the citie hath no neede of the sun neither of the moone to shine in it for the glorie of god doth light it and the lambe is the light of it man shall not then neede meate drinke clothing sleepe recreation fire shade respiration or any other such like but god himselfe immediately shal be their life and all things concerning life by christ which john signifieth when he saith that he revelation saw a pure river of water of life cleere as christal proceding out of the throne of god amp of the lamb there being by either side of it the tree of life which bare two manner of fruites and gaue fruit euerie moneth and whereas god is continually to be worshipped in heauen they neede no other tabernacle or temple thereunto but god himselfe shall be their temple as john saith revelation i saw no temple therein for the lorde god almightie and the lambe are the temple of it fourthly from this glorious communion which is betweene god and christ as he is man and all the saints which are his members there ariseth an vnspeakeable ioy and gladnes wherewith they are filled dauid saith psalm that god children shall be satisfied with the fatnes of his house and that he shall giue them drinke out of the river of his pleasures this ioye vndoubtedlie is infinite and the saintes are not onelie replenished with it but they are also swallowed vp of it as with an huge and infinite sea of water as may appeare in peter who at the transfiguration of christ was so rauished out of measure with ioy at the sight of it that he quite forgot himself saying mat to christ maister it is good being here let vs make three tabernacles here one for thee one for moses and an other for elijah lastly out of this communion ariseth a perfect loue of god whereby the saints loue god with all their hearts with all their soules and strength and this loue sheweth it self in that they are eternally occupied in revelation ver worshipping god by singing of songes of praise and thankes giuing vnto him now the seeing the kingdome of heauen is so glorious and none can haue it but the true christian let all man accompt the best thinges in this worlde philipp as drosse and dung so that they may obtaine christ and his righteousnes the last reason is the endlesse loue of iesus christ shewed in his death and passion thou article by nature the childe of wrath and vengeance sathan hath wounded thee with manie a deadlie wounde of sinne thou liest bleeding at the heart and and article like to die eternally thou being in this estate there is no man on earth no no saint in heauen no angell no creature at all is able to helpe thee christ onely was able hee therefore came downe from heauen and became man for this cause to worke thy deliuerance furthermore in the curing of the wounde of sin no hearbe no water no plaister no phisicke can doe thee any good onely the bodie and bloude of christ is soueraigne for this matter being stieped in the wrath of god hee therefore subiected himselfe to the death euen the death of the crosse vpon which hee suffered the wrath of god due to the sinne of mankinde and of his owne heart bloude hee tempered for thee a soueraigne medicine to heale all thy woundes and sores nowe therefore despise not this mercie seeke vnto christ lay open all thy sores pray him that hee woulde vouchsafe thee if it bee but one droppe of his bloude then he will come vnto thee by his holy spirite he will wash and supple thy wounds in his bloud and binde them vp he is the revelation tree of life the leaues whereof heale the nation if thou get but one leafe of him thou article well it will heale thee and restore thy dead soule that thou maiest liue eternallie in the kingdome of heauen if this reason will not mooue thee to be a christian thy case is desperate it is the best reason that paule could vse to this purpose as obedient children saith he fashion not your selues vnto the former lustes of your ignorance pet ver but as hee which hath called you is holie so bee yee holie in all manner of conuersation his reason followeth ver knowing that yee were not redeemed with corruptible thinges as siluer and golde from your vaine conuersation receaued by the tradition of the fathers but with the precious bloud of christ as a lamb vndefiled and without spotte thus much haue i spoken to the worldling who in his heart makes no more account of christ then of his olde shooes and who had rather bee without christ math then be without his pigges with the gaderenes nowe for the true christians i haue nothing to saie but this the lorde increase the number of them and colloss ver the lorde fulfill them with the knowledge of his will in all wisedome and spiritual vnderstanding that they may walke worthie of him and please him in all thinges beeing fruitfull in all good workes and increasing in the knowledge of god and whereas they are at continuall war against the flesh the world and the diuel lord jesus strengthen them with all might through thy glorious power vnto all patience and long suffering with ioyfulnes and deere father of all mercie plant that gouernement in thy church euerie where which thou hast reuealed in thy worde that thy saintes may worshippe thee in o those meanes in that order and comelines which thou hast appointed abounding in righteousnes peace of conscience and ioy of the holy ghost amen because of our auncient acquaintance and familiaritie deare friende eusebius i will make bolde with you to aske such questions as may be for my edification and comfort and of no other matters but euen of religion whereof i see you are an olde professor and first of all let me be bold to aske this question of you how it pleased god to make you a true christian and a member of christ iesus whom i see you serue continually with a feruent zeale for that olde acquaintance that was betweene vs and for that you are desirous to liue a godly life in christ iesus i will not conceale the good worke of my god in me therefore i pray you marke a little what i shall say and i will declare vnto you the truth euen foorth of the feeling of mine owne conscience the fall of adam did make mee the heire of vengeance and wrath of god and heire of eternall damnation and did bring mee into captiuitie and bondage vnder the diuell and the diuell was my lorde and my ruler my heade my gouernor and my prince yes and my god and my will was locked amp knit faster vnto the will of the diuell then coulde an hundred thousand chaines binde a man vnto a post vnto the diuels will did i consent with all my heart with all my minde with all my might power strength will and life so that the lawe and will of the diuell was written as well in my heart as in my members and i ran headlong after the diuel with full soule and the whole swing of all the power i had as a stone cast vp into the aire commeth downe naturally of it self with al the violent swing of his own weight o with what deadly amp venemous heart did i hate mine enimies with howe great malice of minde inwardlie did i sley and murther with what violence and rage yes with what seruent lust committed i adulterie fornication and such like vncleannes with what pleasure and delectation like a glutton serued i my bellie with what diligence deceiued i howe busilie sought i the things of the world whatsoeuer i did worke imagine or speak was abhominable in the sight of god for i could referre nothing vnto the honour of god neither was his lawe or will written in my members or in my hart neither was there anie more power in me to followe the will of god then in a stone to ascend vpward of it selfe and besides that i was a sleepe in so deepe blindnesse that i could neither see nor feele in what miserie thraldome and wretchednes i was till moses came and awaked mee and published the lawe when i heard the lawe truelie preached how that i ought to loue and honour god with all my strength and might from the lowe bottome of the heart because hee did create mee lord ouer it and my neighbour yes mine enemy as my selfe inwardlie from the ground of my heart because god hath made them after the likenesse of his owne image and they are his sonnes as well as i and christ hath bought them with his bloud and made them heires of euerlasting life as well as i and howe i ought to doe whatsoeuer god biddeth and to abstaine from whatsoeuer god forbiddeth with all loue and meekenesse with a feruent and burning lust from the entire of the heart then beganne my conscience to rage against the lawe and against god no sea bee it neuer so great a tempest was so vnquiet for it was not possible for mee a naturall man to consent to the lawe that it should be good or that god should be righteous which made the lawe in as much as it was contrarie vnto my nature and damned mee and all that i could doe and neuer shewed mee where to fetch helpe nor preached any mercy rom but onelie set mee at variance with god and prouoked and stirred mee to raile on god and to blaspheme him as a cruell tyrant and indeed it was not possible to doe otherwise to thinke that god made me of so poisoned a nature and gaue me an impossible lawe to performe i beeing not borne againe by the spirite and my wit reason and will beeing so fast glewed yes nailed and cheined vnto the wil of the diuell this was the captiuitie and bondage whence christ deliuered mee redeemed and loosed me his bloud his death his patience in suffering rebukes and wronges and the full wrath of god his prayers and fastings his meekenes amp fulfilling the vttermost points of the lawe appeased the wrath of god brought the fauour of god to mee againe obtained that god should loue mee first amp be my father and that a mercifull father that would consider my infirmitie amp weaknesse and would giue mee his spirit againe which hee had taken awaie in adam to rule gouerne and strengthen mee and to breake the bandes of sathan wherein i was so straight bound when christ was on this wise preached and the promises rehearsed which are cotained in the booke of god which preaching is called the gospell or glad tidings and i had deepelie considered the same then my heart began to waxe soft amp melt at the bounteous mercie of god and kindnesse shewed of christ for when the gospell was preached the spirite of god me thought entred into my heart and opened my in warde eyes and wrought a liuely faith in me and made my woful conscience feele and taste how sweet a thing the bitter death of christ is amp how merciful amp louing god is through christs purchasing and merits and made mee beginne to loue againe and to consent to the lawe of god how that it is good and ought so to bee and that god is righteous that made it lastlie it wrought in me a desire to bee whole and to hunger and thirst after more righteousnesse and more strength to fulfil the law more perfectlie and in all that i doe or leaue vndone to seeke god honour and his will with meeknesse euermore condemning the imperfectnes of my deeds by the law now then this good work of god to my saluation standeth in two pointes the working of the law and the working of the gospell the preaching of the lawe was a key that bound and damned my conscience the preaching of the gospell was an other key that loosed me againe these two salues i meane the lawe amp the gospell vsed god amp his preacher to heale and cure mee a wretched sinner withall the lawe did driue out my disease and made it appeare and was a sharpe salue and fretting corasiue amp killed the dead flesh and losed and drewe the sore out by the roote and all corruption it pulled from me all trust and confidence i had in my selfe and in mine owne workes merits deseruings and ceremonies and robbed me of all my righteousnes amp made me poore it killed me in sending me downe to hell and bringing mee almost to vtter desperation amp prepared the way of the lord as it is written of john baptist for it was not possible that christ should come vnto mee as long as i trusted in my selfe or in any worldly thing or had anie righteousnes of mine owne or riches of holie workes then afterwarde came the gospell a more gentle plaister which oupled and swaged my wounds of my conscience and brought me health it brought the spirit of god which loosed the bandes of sathan and coupled me to god amp his wil through a strong faith amp feruet loue which bands were to strong for the diuell the world or anie creature to loose and i a poore amp wretched sinner felt so great mercie that in my selfe i was most sure that god would not forsake mee or euer withdrawe his mercie and loue from mee and i boldlie cryed out with paul saying who shall separate me from the loue of god ampc finallie as before when i was bound to the diuell and his wil i wrought all manner of wickednes for i coulde doe no otherwise it was my nature euen so nowe since i am coupled to god by christes bloud i do good freelie because of the spirit and this my nature and thus i trust i haue satified your first demaund yes but mee thinkes you doe too much condemne your self in respect of sinne for i can remember that from your child hood your were of a good and gentle nature and your behauior was alwaies honest and ciuill and you could neuer abide the company of them which were roisters and ruffians and swearers and blasphemers and contemners of god word and drunkards which nowe are tearmed good fellowes and your dealing with all man hath beene euer commended for good faithfull and iust what meane you then to make your self so abhominable and accursed and to say you were so wholie addicted vnto wickednesse and your will so fearefully and miserablie in captiuitie vnto the will of the diuell brother timoth i know what i say god giue mee grace to speake it with more liuelie feeling of my weaknes amp with a more bitter detestation of my sinne by nature through the fall of adam am i the childe of wrath heire of the vengeance of god by birth yes and so from my first conception and i had my fellowshippe with the damned diuels vnder the power of darknes and rule of sathan while i was yet in my mothers womb and although i showed not the fruites of sinne as soone as i was born nor log after yet was i full of the naturall poyson fro whence all wicked deeds do spring amp canot but sin outwardly as soone as i am able to work be i neuer so yong if occasion be giuen for my nature is to sinne as is the nature of a serpent to sting and as a serpent yet young or yet vnbrought foorth is full of poyson and cannot afterwarde when time and occasion is giuen but bring forth the fruites thereof and as an adder a toad or a serpent is hated of man not for the euill it hath done but for the poyson that is in it and hurt which it cannot but doe so am i hated of god for that naturall poyson which is concieued and borne with mee before i doe anie outwarde euill and as the euill which a venemous worme doth maketh it not a serpent but because it is a venemous worme therefore doth it euill and poysoneth euen so doe not our euill deedes make vs euill first but because wee are of nature euill therefore doe we euill and thinke euill to eternall damnation by the lawe and are contrarie to the will of god in our will and in all things consent vnto the will of the fiend as yet i neuer had such a feeling of my sinne as you haue had and although i woulde bee loth to commit anie sinne yet the lawe was neuer so terrible vnto me condemning me pronouncing the sentence of death against mee and stinging my conscience with feare of euerlasting paine as i perceiue it hath beene vnto you therefore i feare oftentimes least my profession of religion should be onelie in truth meere hypocrisie i praie you let me heare your minde a true saying it is that the right waie to goe vnto heauen is to sayle by hell and there is no man lyuing that feeleth the power and vertue of the bloude of christ which first hath not felt the strange paynes of hell but yet in these paines there is a difference and it is the will of god that his children in their conuersion shall some of them feele more and some lesse ezechias on his death bedde complaineth that the lorde breaketh his bones like a lion that he could not speake by reason of paine but chattered in his throte like a crane and mourned like a doue iob saith that god is his enemie and hath set him vp as a marke to shoote at and that the arrowes of the almightie are vpon him and that the poison of them hath dronke vp his spirite dauid bewaileth his estate in manie psalmes but especiallie in the psalme where he beginneth on this manner out of the deepe places haue i called vnto thee o lorde which is as though hee shoulde saie o my poore soule fall not flatte downe vexe not thy selfe out of measure the burden of thy sinnes presse thee sore indeede but bee not for all that quite ouerwhelmed thou article thrust downe so lowe into the depth of deepes that thou had neede crie aloude to bee hearde of him which dwelleth in the highest heightes and the euerburning hell fire is not farre from that lake whither thine iniquities haue pluged thee o that thou maiest perceiue as it were the eccho of their cries and desperate how nges which bee there cast out of all hope of euer comming forth but the lord which bringeth foorth euen to the borders of hell his best beloued when they forget them selues knoweth also how well to bring them backe againe goe no further then downwarde but li t vp thy heart together with thine eie and seeke vnto the lord to reach vnto thee his mercifull and helping hand againe in the scriptures wee finde examples of man conuerted vnto the lord without anie vehement sorrowe of their sinnes what anguish of coscience had the theefe vppon the crosse for his former life in his present conuersion at the houre of death how was lidia dismayed and cast downe in respect of hir wickednesse like as dauid was or iob whose heart god onelie is saide to haue opened to giue attendance to the preaching of paul and silas who also euen presentlie after was readie to entertaine them and to make them a feast in hir house which she could not haue done if shee had beene in the perplexities of ezechias or dauid the same may be spoken of the iailer and of them which hearde peters sermon at ierusalem who for all that they had murdred our sauior christ yet in their conuersio their harts were onely for the time pricked so then god in preparing vs which in truth are nothing but fleshly and stincking doung hils of sinne nay verie vncleannesse amp pollution it selfe i saie in preparing vs to be the teples of his holy spirit to dwell in amp the store houses to horde vp his heauenlie graces in doth otherwhilesvse a milde and gentle remedie amp maketh the law to looke vpon vs though with no louing amp gentle yet with no feareful countenance amp otherwhiles in some he setteth a sharp edge vpon the law amp maketh it to wound the hart very deepe and as a strong corasiue to torment them amp to frette amp gnawe vpon their consciences and we see by experience that a botch or a bile in a mans bodie is as wel eased of the corruptio that is in it by the pricking of the point of a small needle as by the launcing of a great raser wherfore if god by his spirit haue wrought in you sorrowe for sinne in anie small measure though not in as great measure as you desire you haue no cause to complaine and in that you are greeued amp sorrowfull for your sinnes it is a good token of the grace of god in you surelie this is a great comforte ou giue mee god make mee thankefull or it and i praie you more plainely shew me the state of your life till this houre that i and all other may take warning by it that which may doe good vnto other man i will neuer conceale though it be to my perpetuall shame as i was conceiued amp born in sin so my parets brought me vp in ignorace amp neuer shewed me my shame and miserie by god law amp i liued a long time euen as a man in a dead sleepe or trance and in truth i liued as though there were neither heauen nor hell neither god nor diuel and the diuel himself as now i perceiue did often perswade my secure conscience that i was the child of god and shoulde be saued as well as the best man in the world and i yeelded to this perswasion and did verilie thinke it so that when the preacher for wickednesse and securitie denounced god iudgementes and hell fire i haue saide vnto my neighbours that i hoped i should be saued and he should goe to hell and when i was asked whether i could keepe all the commandements of the lawe i saide that i coulde and being asked whether i neuer sinned i saide i thought that otherwhiles i did marrie for them which were but fewe i hoped god woulde haue mercie and haue me excused and all my neighbors were glad of my company they spoke well of me and i was taken for an honest man when as indeed before god i was a vile beast amp the childe of wrath inspired with the spirite of the diuell continuallie well afterward i heard the law preached and i sawe and remembred manie fearefull iudgements of god vpon man whom i in reason thought were as good man as i then i beganne to consider mine owne estate and to perceiue my sinnes and my cursednesse and vpon a time aboue all other the curse of the lawe made mee inwardlie afraide and my flesh then beganne to tremble and quake then i could not sleepe in the night season i was afraide of euerie thing if i were in my house i thought the house would fall on my head if abroade i thought euerie crannie of the earth would open it selfe wider and swallow me i started at euerie strawe and at the moouing of a flie my meate was lothsome vnto me and i thought i was not worthie of so good a creature of god and that god might iustlie turne it to my bane the greefe of my heart for my life past made me shed abundance of tears and vpon that i remembred that i had heard read in the church in dauids psalmes that his teares were his drinke and that hee did wette his bed with teares and now the deuill changed both his coate and his note amp in fearefull manner cryed in my eares that i was a reprobate his childe that none of god children were as i am that this griefe of my soule was the beginning of hell and the greater was my paine because i durst not open my minde vnto anie for feare they shoulde haue mocked mee and haue made a iest of it wherefore i was fayne to go to a godlie learned preacher i shewed myne estate vnto him after i had continued with him the space of two or three daies i receiued comfort both by the promises of mercie which hee shewed mee in the booke of god and by his feruent godlie and effectuall prayers and i thanke god euer since i haue had some assurance in spite of the deuill that i doe apperteine to the kingdome of heauen and am nowe a member of iesus christ and shall so continue for euer how know you that god hath forgiuen your sinne because i am a sinner amp he is both able and willing to forgiue me i graunt that hee is able to forgiue you but how know you that he will you know your sinnes are very great i graunt but christs passion is far greater and although my sinnes were as red as scarlet and as purple yet they shall be as white as snow and as soft as wooll oh but you haue sinned verie often tell mee not i pray you what i haue done but what i will doe what will you doe by god grace it is my full purpose and my earnest praier to god is hereafter to take better heede and to amend my former life is that inough thinke you what lacketh the fauour and mercie of god that may cleane forsake you nay that i will neuer graunt for i am certainly perswaded of the fauour amp mercie of god euen to the saluation of my soule oh shewe mee that that is the thing i earnestly desire to bee assured of god speciall goodnes euen by your feeling according as god hath giuen me to feele the same so will i shewe it you and first of all the dealing of god towards me is a good argument to mee in the first commandement god hath commaunded me to take him to bee my god and in the lord praier he teacheth me to call him father he hath created the world generallie and euerie creature particularlie for man amp so for me to serue for my commoditie necessity and admonition also he hath made me after his owne image hauing a reasonable soule body shape where he might haue made me a toad a serpent a swine deformed frantick moreouer he hath woderfullie preserued me in my infancie childhood youth middle age hitherto from manifold dagers amp perils all which do confirm in me a perswasion of god fatherlie loue amp that i should not doubt hereof where i might haue beene borne of turks lo it was the wil of god that i should be borne of christian parets amp be brought into god church by baptisme which is the sacrament of adoption amp requireth faith as wel of the remission of my sins as of sanctification and holines to bee wrought of god in mee by his grace and holie spirite where i might haue been borne in an ignorant time and region god would that i shoulde be borne in these daies and in this country where is more knowledge reuealed then euer was here or in manie places els is where i might haue beene of a corrupt iudgement amp entangled with manie errours of popery amp of the familie of loue amp of that hypocritical brown by god goodnes my iudgement is reformed and he hath lightened mine eies to see amp my heart to imbrace his sincere truth by all which things i doe confirme my faith of this that god alwaies hath beene is and wil be for euer my father amp at my departing forth of this world will giue me the crowne of euerlasting glorie secondlie when as man is euermore doubting of the promises of god be they neuer so certain god of his infinite mercie to preuent all occasions of doubting promiseth to giue his owne spirit as a pledge pawne or earnest pennie vnto his children of their adoption amp election to saluation now since it pleased god to call me from hypocrisie to bee a member of his church i feel that in my self which i neuer felt or heard of before in times past i came to praiers and to the preaching of god word euen as a beare commeth to the stake now the word of god is meate and drinke to me and praier is no burden vnto me but my ordinarie exercise if i rise in the morning i am not well till i haue praied and giuen thankes to god if i doe any thing it commeth into my minde to pray in my praiers i finde great ioy and comforte and the exceeding fauour of god i neuer think i can well take my rest or doe anie thing else except first i aske it at god hande in christ lastlie when my minde and heart is whollie occupied in worldlie matters i am stirred vp and as it were drawne to pray vnto god for the remission of my sinnes and the assurance of my saluation and in praier i haue had those grones which for their greatnes cannot bee expressed nowe from whence commeth all this from the diuell no in these actions i haue found him my enemie and a continuall hinderer of them for he by his craft when i haue beene heauie and weake hath assailed to prouoke me to some sinnes whereunto my cursed nature was most giuen and i hauing yeelded to him haue beene so hardened and blinded by those sinnes that for a time i haue made light account of the worde of god and praier well then peraduenture this came from mine owne selfe no neither this cursed nature of mine hath beene more pleased and delighted with sinne and with the pleasures of the world then with such exercises from which it draweth mee amp presseth me down as lead i cannot think that such a poisoning cockatrice can laie such good egges or that wild crabbe trees such as all man are in adam can bring foorth sweete fruites according to the will of god except god plucke them foorth of adam and plant them in the garden of his mercie and stocke them and graft the spirite of christ in them wherefore these are the workes of god spirit and my conscience is thereby certified that god hath giuen me the spirite of adoption and therefore that his fauour and mercie shall continue towardes me for euer for the giftes of god are without repentance and whome god once loueth him hee loueth for euer thirdlie there bee certaine fruites of god children which i finde in mee by which i am confirmed in god fauour saint john in his first epistle saith that hereby wee know that wee are translated from death to life because we loue the bretheren truelie feele in my heart a burning loue towardes them which are good christians though i neuer knewe them nor saw them and i am verie desirous to doe anie good for them and if drops of my heart bloude would doe them good they should haue them moreouer i hate all sinne and wickednesse with a bitter hatred and i long to see the comming of my sauiour christ to iudgement i am grieued and disquieted because i cannot fulfill the law of god as i ought all which i haue learned foorth of god word to be tokens of god children and thus you see what euidence i haue to shewe that i am a true member of the church militant and in the fauour of god haue you a stedfast faith in christ as these arguments seeme to proue without all wauering doubting and distrusting of god mercie no no this my faith which i haue in christ is euen fought against with doubting amp euer assailed with desperation not when i sinne onely but also in tentations of aduersitie into which god bringeth me to nurture me amp to shew me mine owne heart the hypocrisie amp false thoughts that there lie hid my almost no faith at al and as litle loue euen then happily whe i thought my self most perfect of all for when tentations come i cannot stand when i haue sinned faith is feble when wrong is done vnto mee i cannot forgiue in sicknes in losse of goods in al tribulation i am vnpatient whe my neighbor needeth my helpe that i must depart with him of mine owne then loue is cold and thus i learne amp feele that there is no power to do good but of god only and in al such tentations my faith perisheth not vtterlie neither my loue and consent to the law of god but they be weake sicke wounded amp not cleane dead as i dealt with my parents being a child so now deal i towards god my louing father when i was a child my father and mother taught me nurture amp wisedome i loued my father amp all his commaundements and perceiued the goodnes he shewed mee that my father loued mee and all his precepts are vnto my wealth and profit and that my father commandeth nothing for anie need he hath thereof but seeketh my profit onelie and therefore i haue a good faith vnto all my fathers promises and loue all his commaundements and doe them with good will and with good will goe euerie daie to the schoole and by he waie happilie i sawe company plaie and with the sight was taken and rauished of my memorie and forgot my selfe and stoode and beheld and fell to plaie also forgetting father and mother amp all their kindnes all their lawes and mine owne profite also how beit the knowledge of my fathers kindnes the faith of his promisses and the loue that i had againe vnto my father and the obedient minde were not vtterlie quenched but laie hid as all things doe when a man sleepeth or lieth in a traunce and as soone as i had plaied out all my listes or else by some had been warned in the meane season i came againe to my olde profession notwithstanding manie temptations went ouer my heart and the lawe as a right hangman tormented my conscience and went nie to perswade mee that my father would thrust me awaie and hang me if hee catched me so that i was like a great while to runne away rather then to returne to my father againe feare and dread of rebuke and of losse of my fathers loue and of punishment wrastled with the trust which i had in my fathers goodnesse and as it were gaue my faith a fall but i rose againe as soone as the rage of the first brunt was past and my minde was more quiet and the goodnes of my father and his olde kindnes came vnto my remembrance either by mine owne courage or by the comfort of another and i beleeued that my father would not put me away or destroie me and hee hoped that i woulde doe no more so and vpon that i got me home againe dismaied but not altogether faithlesse the olde kindnes would not let me dispaire how beit all the worlde coulde not set mine heart at rest vntill the paine had beene past and vntill i had heard the voice of my father that all is forgotten seeing that you haue thus plainelie and truelie shewed the weaknes of yours and consequentlie of all mens faith shewe mee i praie you howe by the weakenes of faith a christian is not rather discomforted then comforted and assured of his saluation god doth not so much regarde the quantitie of his graces as the truth of them hee approoueth a litle faith if it bee a true faith yes if faith in vs were no more but a graine of mustard seede which is the least of al other seedes it should be effectual and god would haue respect vnto it the poore diseased beggar with a lame hande hauing the palsie also is able neuerthelesse to reach out the same and receiue an almes of a king and so in like manner a weake and languishing faith is sufficietly able to reach out it selfe and to apprehende the infinite mercies of our heauenlie king offered vnto vs in christ faith in the of john is compared vnto the eie of the israelite which although it were of dimme sight or looked a squint yet if it could neuer so little beholde the brasen serpent it was sufficient to cure the stings of the fiery serpets amp to saue life seing that you satisfie me in euery point so fully shew me i pray you whether a man may be wicked amp haue faith amp whether faith entring expelleth wickednes for i haue heard some saie that a ma might beleeue the word of god and yet be neuer the better in his life or holier the before he was many there are which when they heare or read of faith at once they consent thereunto amp haue a certain imagination amp opinio of faith as whe a man telleth a storie or a thing done in a strage land that perteineth not to the at al which yet they beleeue amp tel as a true thing amp this imagination o opinion they call faith therfore as soone as they haue this imagination or opinion in their heartes they saie verilie this doctrine seemeth true i beleeue it euen so the they thinke that the right faith is there but afterward when they feele in themselues no maner of working of the spirite neither the terrible sentence of the law amp the horrible captiuity vnder satan neither can perceiue any alteration in theselues amp that any good works follow but find they are altogether as before amp abide in their old state the think they y t faith is not sufficient but that works must be ioined with faith to iustificatio but true faith is only the gift of god amp is mightie in operation euer working being full of vertue it renueth man amp begetteth him a fresh altreth him changeth him amp turneth him altogether into a new creature amp conuersatio so that a ma shal feel his hart clean changed amp far otherwise disposed then before amp hath power to loue y t which before he could not but hate amp delighteth in that which before he abhorred amp hateth y t which before he could not but loue and it setteth the soul at liberty amp maketh hir free to follow the wil of god amp is to the soul as health to y e body after y t a ma is pined with log sick es the legs cannot bear him he cannot lift vp his hands to help him his tast is corrupt sugar is better in his mouth his stomacke longeth after slubbersauce and swash at which a whole stomacke is ready to cast his gorge when health commeth shee changeth and altereth him cleane giueth him strength in all his members lust and will to doe of his owne accorde that which before he could not doe neither coulde suffer that anie man should exhort him to doe amp hath now lust in wholsome things and his members are free and at libertie and haue power to doe all things of his owne accord which belong to a sounde and whole man to doe and faith worketh in the same manner as a tree bringes foorth fruite of his owne accorde and as a man neede not bidde a tree bring foorth fruite so is there no lawe put to him that beleeueth and is iustified through faith neither is it needefull for the lawe is written and grauen in his heart his pleasure is dailie therein and as without commaundement euen of his owne nature he eateth drinketh seeth heareth talketh goeth euen so of his owne nature without anie compulsion of the lawe bringeth foorth good workes and as an whole man when hee is a thirst tarrieth but for drinke and when he hungreth abideth but for meate and then drinketh and eateth naturallie euen so is the faithfull euer a thirst and an hungred after the will of god and tarrieth but for an occasion and whensoeuer an occasion is giuen hee worketh naturallie the will of god for this blessing is giuen them that trust in christs bloude that they thirst and hunger to doe god will he that hath not this faith is but an vnprofitable babler of faith and workes and neither worketh what hee bableth nor whereunto his words pretend for he feeleth not the power of faith nor the working of the spirit in his heart but interpreteth the scriptures which speake of faith and workes after his owne blinde reason and foolish fantasies not hauing any experience in himselfe euerie member of christs congregation is a sinner and sinneth daily some more amp some lesse for it is written ioh if we saie we haue no sin we deceiue our selues and the truth is not in vs and paule rom that good which i would that do i not but that euill which i would not that doe i so it is not i that doe it saith hee but sinne that dwelleth in mee so the christian man is both a sinner and no sinner which how it can be shew it me by your experience i being one man in substance and two man in qualitie flesh and spirite which in me so fight perpetuallie the one against the other that i must goe either backward or forwarde and cannot stand long in one state if the spirite ouercome in tentations then is shee stronger and the flesh weaker but if the flesh get a custome then is the spirit none otherwise oppressed of the flesh then as though she had a mountaine on hir backe and as we sometime in our dreames thinke we beare heauier then a milstone on our breasts or when we dreame nowe and then that wee would runne awaie for feare of some thing our legges seeme heauier then leade euen so is the spirite oppressed and ouerladen of the flesh through custome that shee strugleth and striueth to gette vp and to breake loose in vaine vntill the god of mercie which heareth my grone through iesus christ come and lose hir with his power and put something on the backe of the flesh to keepe hir downe to minish hir strength and to mortifie hir so then no sinner i am if you regard the spirit the profession of my heart toward the lawe of god my repentance and sorrowe that i haue both because i haue sinned and am yet full of sinne amp looke vnto the promises of mercie in our sauiour christ and vnto my faith a sinner am i if you looke to the frailty of my flesh which is a remnant of the olde adam and as it were the state of the wild oliue tree euer and anone when occasion is giuen shooting forth his branches leaues bud blossome and fruite also which also is as the weakenes of one that is newlie recouered out of a great disease by the reason whereof all my deedes are imperfect and when occasions be great i fall into horrible deeds and the fruit of the sinne which remaineth in my members breaketh out notwithstanding the spirit leaueth me not but rebuketh mee and bringeth mee home againe vnto my profession so that i neuer cast of the yoke of god from of my necke neither yeelde vp my selfe vnto sinne to serue it but fight a fresh and beginne a new battaile and i had rather you should vnderstande this foorth of the scriptures by the example of ionas and the apostles ionas was the friende of god and a chosen seruaunt of god to testifie his will vnto the worlde hee was sent from the lande of israell where he was a prophet to goe amongest an heathen people and the greatest citie of the worlde then called niniuie to preach that within fortie dayes they shoulde bee destroyed for their sinnes which message the free will of ionas had as much power to doe as the weakest hearted woman in the worlde had power if shee were commaunded to leape into a tubbe of liuing snakes and adders as happelie if god had commanded sara to sacrifice hir son isaac as he did abraham she would haue disputed with god ere shee had done it or though shee were strong enough well ionas hartned by his owne imagination and reasoning after this manner i am here a prophet vnto god people the israelits which though they haue god worde testified vnto them daylie yet despise and worshippe god vnder the likenesse of calues amp after all maner of fashions saue after his owne worde and therefore are of all nation the worst and most worthie of punishment and yet god for loue of a few that are among them amp for his names sake spareth and defendeth them how then shal god take so cruel vengeace on so great a multitude of the to who his name was neuer preached amp therefore are not the tenth part so euill as these if i therefore shall goe preach i shal lie amp shame my selfe and god too amp make them the more to despise god vpon this imagination hee fledde from the presence of god and from the country where god is worshipped when ionas entred into the ship he laide him downe to sleepe for his conscience was tossed betweene the commandement of god which sent him to niniuie and his fleshlie wisedome which disswaded and counselled him to the contrarie amp at last preuayled against the commaundement and carried him an otherway as a shippe caught betweene two streames as the poets faine the mother of meleager to be betweene diverse affections while to adventure hir brothers death shee sought to sley hir owne son wherevpon for verie payne and tediousnesse shee laye downe to sleep to put the commandement out of minde which did so gnawe and fret hir conscience as the nature of all the wicked is when they haue sinned in earnest to eeke all meanes with riote reuell and pa time to driue the remembrance of sinne oorth of their hearts as adam did to co er his wickednesse with apperns of figge eaues but god awoke him out of his reame and set his sinnes before his face for when the lott had caught ionas the be sure that his sin came to remebrance again amp that his conscience raged no lesse the the water of the sea and then he thought he onely was a sinner and thought also that as verilie as he had fled fro god as verily god had cast him awaie for the sight of the rod maketh the naturall child not onely to see and acknowledge his fault but also to forget all his fathers old mercie and goodnes and then hee confessed his sinne openlie and of verie desperation to haue liued any longer hee had cast himselfe into the sea betimes except they woulde bee lost also for all this god prouided a fish to swallow ionas when ionas had beene in the fish bellie a space the rage of his conscience was somewhat quieted and hee came to himselfe againe and had receiued a little hope and the qualmes and panges of desperation which went ouer his heart were halfe ouercome then hee prayed to god and gaue thankes vnto him when ionas was cast vppon the lande againe then his will was free and he had power to go whether god sent him and to what god commanded him his owne imagination laid apart for he had ben at a new schole amp in a fornace wher he was purged of much refue amp drosse of fleshlie wisedom which resisted y e wisedom of god for as far as we be blind in adam we cannot but seeke and will our own profit pleasure amp glorie amp as far as we be taught in the spirit we cannot but seeke and will the pleasure of god only then ionas preached to niniuie and they repented the ionas shewed again his corrupt nature for all his trying in the whale bellie he was so displeased because the niniuits perished not he was weary of his life amp wished death for very sorrow that hee had lost the glory of his prophecying in y t his prophecy came not to passe but hee was rebuked of god as in his prophecy you may read the apostles christ taught the euer to be meek amp to humble theselues yet oft they striued among themselues who should be greatest the son of zebede would sit one on y e right hand of christ the other on the left they would pray that fire might descend fro heaue amp consume the samaritans whe christ asked who say man that i am peter answered thou article the son of the liuing god as though peter had beene as perfecte as an angell but imediatlie after when christ preached nto them of his death and passion peter was angry and rebuked christ and thought earnestlie that hee had raued and not wist what hee had said as at another time when christ was so feruentlie busied in healing the people that he had no leasure to eate they went out to holde him supposing that hee had beene beside himselfe and one that cast foorth diuelles in christes name they forbadde because hee waited not on the so glorious were they yet and though christ taught alway to forgiue yet peter after long going to schole asked whether man should forgiue seauen times thinking that eight times had beene too much and at the last supper peter woulde haue died with christ but yet within fewe houres after he denied him both cowardly amp shamefullie and after the same manner though he had so long hearde that no man must auenge himselfe but rather turne the other cheeke to the smiter againe yet when christ was in taking peter asked whether it were lawful to smite with the sworde and taried no answere but laide on rashlie so that although wee bee once reconciled to god yet at the first we be but children and yong scholers weake and feeble and must haue leasure to growe in the spirite i knowledg loue and deeds thereof as yong children must haue time to growe in their body and so in like manner the sting of the serpent is not pulled out at once but the poyson of our nature is minished by little and little and cannot before the houre of death be wholie taken awaie i perceiue by your godlie discourse the manifolde conflictes betweene the flesh and the spirite and that the flesh is like to a mightie giant such a one as was goliah strong lustie stirring enimie to god confederate with the diuell and the spirite like to a little childe such a one as was little dauid new borne weake and feeble not alwaies stirring nowe then what meanes do you vse to weaken the flesh and strengthen the spirit i vse to tame my flesh with praier and fasting watching deedes of mercie holie meditations amp reading the scriptures and in bodilie labour and in with drawing all manner of pleasures from the flesh and with exercises contrarie to the vices which i finde in my bodie most inclined to and with absteining from all things that encourage the flesh against the spirit as reading of toyes and wanton bookes seeing of plaies and enterluds wanton communication foolish iesting amp effeminate thoughts and talking of couetousnes which paul forbiddeth ephesians magnifying of worldly promotions if these will not mortifie my flesh then god sendeth me some troubles and so maketh me to grow amp waxe perfect and fineth and trieth me as gold in the fire of tentations and tribulations thus verie often he maketh me to take vp my crosse amp naileth my flesh vnto it for the mortifying thereof marke this if god send thee to the sea amp promise to go with thee he wil raise vp a tempest against thee to prooue whether thou wilt abide by his word and that thou maist feele thy faith amp weakenes and perceiue his goodnes for if it were alwaies faire weather and thou neuer brought into such ieopardie whence his mercie onlie deliuereth thee thy faith should bee onelie a presumption amp thou shouldest be euer vnthankefull to god and merciles vnto thy neighbour if god promise riches the waie therevnto is pouertie whom he loueth him he chasteneth whom he exalteth hee casteth downe whom he saueth he first damneth hee bringeth no man to heauen except he send him to hell first if hee promis life he slayeth first when he buildeth he casteth downe all first he is no patcher hee cannot abide another mans foundation he will not worke till all bee past remedie and brought to such a case that me may see how that his had his power his mercy his goodnes his truth hath wrought altogether hee will let no man be partaker with him of his praise and glorie his works are wonderfull amp contrarie to mans workes who euer saue he deliuered his own son his only son his deere son his darling vnto the death amp for his enimies to win his enimies to ouercome the with loue that he might see loue amp loue again and of loue likewise to doe to other man amp to ouercome them with well doing ioseph saw the sun and the moone and seauen starres worshipping him neuertheles ere that came to passe god laid him where he could see neither sun nor moone neither anie star of the skie and that many yeres and also vndeserued to nurture him to make him humble amp meeke amp to teach him god waies and to make him apte and meete for y t roome amp honor again he came to it that he might be strong in the spirit to minister it well god promised the children of israel a land with river of milke amp honie yet hee brought them foorth the space of fortie yeares into a lande where in river of milke and honie were but where so much as a drop of water was not to nurture and teach them as a father doth his son and to doe them good at the latter ende to seduce their cankred nature to make them strong in the spirite to vse his benefites aright lastlie god promised dauid a kingdome and immediatelie stirred vp saul against him to persecute him and to hunt him as man doe hayres with gray houndes and to ferret him out of euerie hole and that for the space of manie yeares to turne him to make him to mortifie his lustes to make him feel his own diseases in fine to make him a good man and a good king but how if it come to passe that you be tempted to anie great sinne and the fleshe ouercome the spirit in what case are you then there is no bodie here but you amp i and i take you to bee a christian and a faithfull friende therefore i will shewe a little of my exhortation the last yeare by reason of the dearth i and my familie were put to great pinches and most commonly we had nothing but bread and water here vpon i bethought mee howe i might get somewhat to releiue my familie it came into my minde that in our towne a rich man had a great flocke of sheepe and that i might take one of them without any hurt of him i was verie loath at the first but because there was such great stealing of sheepe amp i was in extremitie in the night i went among his sheep and tooke a lambe and told my familie that it was giuen me i presently killed it the skinne and the entralles i burned on my backeside the fleshe wee dressed by quarters and did eate it with thanksgiuing as my manner is but surely verie coldlie and mee thought my prayer was abhominable in god sight after i had thus done we fared wel for the space of two daies but i felt my heart hardned and my lips were almost locked vp that i could not as i was wont praise the lord the third night after i went with a quiet conscience mee thought to my bedde and then i slept soundlie till three of the clocke in the morning but i dreamed that one came to carrie me to pryson vpon that on a sudden i awaked and beeing afraide looked about mee and fell to consider why i should be afraide and i remembred that i had sinned against god by robbing my neighbor then my feare increased and i thought that hell gaped to deuoure me and the law looked vpon me with such a terrible countenaunce and so thundred in myne eares that i durst not abide in my bed but vp amp to goe then the diuell assailed me on euerie side to perswade that god had cast mee awaie saying they that be god haue power to keepe his law thou hast not but breakest them therefore thou article a cast awaie and a damned creature amp hell gapeth and setteth ope his mouth to deuour thee and i thought with my selfe that i had beene alwaies a ranke hypocrite for as the cloudes of the ayre doe couer the sun so that sometimes a man cannot tell by anie sense that there is anie sun the clouds amp windes hiding it from our sight euen so my cecitie and blindnesse and corrupt affections and the rage of my conscience did so ouershadow the sight of god seed in me and so ouerwhelme his spirite as though i ha beene a plaine reprobate and thus i came to passe that dauid making his praier to god according to his owne sens and feeling but not according to the truth desired of god to giue him againe his spirite which thing god neuer doth indeede although hee made mee to thinke so for a time for alwaies hee holdeth his hande vnder his children in their falles that they lie not still as other doe which are not regenerate i being thus turmoiled and stong with the conscience of sinne and the cockatrice of my poisoned nature hauing behelde hirselfe in the glasse of the righteous law of god there was no other salue or remedie but to runne to the brasen serpent christ iesus which shedde his blood hanging vppon the crosse and to his euerlasting testament and mercifull promise that it was shed for mee for the remission of my sinnes therefore i got me speedilie into a close corner in my house and there vpon my face groueling i confessed my sinne and prayed after this manner in effect father what an horrible monster am i what taytor what rascall and villaine thy mercie is woonderfull that hell hath not deuoured me hauing deserued a thousand damnations i haue sinned i haue sinned against thy godly holy amp righteous law and against my brother by robbing him whome i ought to loue for thy sake as dearlie as my selfe forgiue mee father for thy son christ his sake according to thy most mercifull promisses and testament forget not good lorde thy olde mercies shewed vppon me let them not at this time in me be quite remooued on this manner praiing i continued fiue howers and god which is neere to all them that call vppon him heard me eased my paine and assured mee of the remission of my sin after presently for the more easing of my conscience i went to my neighbour amp betweene him and me vpon my knees confessed my fault with teares desiring him to forgiue me amp i woulde as god lawe requireth restore that which i stole foure folde he i thanke him was contented and toke pittie on me and euer since hath beene by god mercie my good friend so by little and little god restored mee to my first estate but mee thinkes i haue not that feeling which i had before and haue bene worse euer since god of his mercie amende me and increase his graces in me praised be god that we fel into this communicatio for i had thought that no ma had ben in such a case but i for i fro my hart detest that babbling which in time past i haue vsed and i haue vowed with my selfe to vse it no more and god hath giuen mee strength and will to paie my vowes amp to keepe them halfe a yere or tweluemonth together and then falling into a company of the honester sort of good fellows i take otherwhiles a cuppe of nimis for which afterwards i am so touched in my conscience and so grieued inwardlie that often i haue no delight in my meate and then i vse praier and reading and meditating of the scriptures and do receiue much comfort but i praie you what thinke you will not god condemne his children if they sinne no for the ground worke of our saluation is laide in god eternall election and a thousande sinnes nay all the sinnes in the worlde nay all the deuilles in hell cannot ouerthrow god election and it maie bee that sins doe harden our hartes weaken our faith make sadde the spirite of god in vs but take awaie faith or altogether quench the spirit they canot god codemneth no man for his sinnes if he bee adopted in christ for then ioseph abraha dauid peter marie magdalene should bee condemned god is like a father amp a father if his childe be sicke and therefore be froward and refuse and cast away his meate amp hauing eaten it spew it vp againe and in his fit be impacient and raue and speake euill of his father yet i say the father wil not cast him forth of his dores but pittieth him and prouideth such things as may restore him to health and when hee is whole remembreth not his disordered behauior in his sicknes what means do you finde most effectuall to strengthe your faith to increase god graces in you and to raise you vp againe when you are fallen surely i haue very great comfort by the sacrament of the lord supper for whereas i am spirituallye diseased and am prone and readye to fall and am most cruelly oftentimes inuaded of the feend the flesh and the law when i haue sinned and am put to flight and made to runne awaye from god my father therefore hath god of all mercie and of his infinite pitty amp bottomlesse compassion set vppe his sacrament as a signe vpon a hie hill whence it may be seene on euery side far and neare to call againe them that be runne awaye and with this sacrament he as it were clocketh to them as a hen dooth for hir chickens to gather them vnder the wings of his mercy and hath commanded his sacrament to be had in continuall vse to put vs in minde of his cotinuall mercy laid vp for vs in christs blood and to witnesse and testifie it vnto them and to be the seale therof for the sacrament dooth much more liuely print the faith and make it sincke downe into the hart then do bare words onely now when the words of the testament and promises are spoken ouer the bread this is my body that was broken for you this is my blood that was shed for you they confirme the faith but much more when the sacrament is seene with the eies and the bread broken the wine powred out and looked on and yet more when i taste it and smell it as you see when a man maketh a promise vnto another with light words betweene theselues amp so they departed he to whom the promis is made beginneth to doubt whether the other spake earnestlye or mocked amp doubteth whether he will remeber his promise to abide by it or no but when any ma speaketh with aduisement the words are more credible amp if he swear it cofirmeth the thing more and yet the more if hee strike hands if hee giue earnest if hee call recorde if he giue hand writing amp seale it so is the more amp more beleeued for the heart gathereth o he spake with aduisement deliberation amp good sadnes he clapped hands called recorde and put to his hande and seale the man cannot bee so faint without the feare of god as to denie al this shame shal make him abide his promise though hee were such a man as i could not compel him if he woulde denie it and thus we dispute god sent his son in our nature and made him feele our infirmities that moue vs to sinne and named his name iesus that is a sauior because he should saue his people fro their sinnes and after his death he sent his apostles to preach these glad tydings to thrust them in at the eares of vs and set vp a sacrament of them to testifie them amp to seale them and to thrust them in not at the eares onely by rehearsing the promises of the testament ouer it neither at our eies onely in beholding it but beat them in through our feeling tasting amp smelling also and to bee repeated dailie amp to be ministred to vs he wold not think we make half so much a do with vs if he loued vs not amp wold not haue his sacrament to bee a witnes and testimonie between him amp vs to confirm the faith of his promisses that wee should not doubt in them when we looke on the seales of his obligations wherewith he hath bound himselfe amp this to keepe the promisses amp couenants better in mind and to make them the more deepely to sinke into our hearts and be more earnestlie regarded considering that this which you saie is too plaine great shame it is that there is such neglect of the sacrament as there is and that it is so seldome vsed but surelie want of faith and the security which ouerspreadeth this our country is the cause of it the lord if it be his will remoue the same now let me heare a litle how you lead your life and haue your conuersation among man i haue my conuersation among man as sincere as i can in righteousnes and holines which is after god commaundements our sauiour saith let your light so shine before man that they may see your good works and glorifie your father which is in heauen it is but a dim light which wee can carrie before man and small are our good works and to be esteemed of no value if we were preachers or rich man or noble man then we might saue soules giue good cousel help manie by our almes but you amp i are poore man of base birth amp of low degree how can we then do anie good works as touching good works by that measure of knowledge that god hath giuen me i thinke that all works are good which are done according to the obedience of god law in faith amp with thankesgiuing to god amp with a mind desirous of his glorie alone amp i think that i or any ma els in doing the please god whatsoeuer i do within the law of god as when i make water and trust me if either winde or water were stopped i should feel what a pretious thing it were to do either of both amp what thaks ought to be giuen god therfore moreouer i put no difference betweene workes but whatsoeuer commeth into my hands that i do as time place amp occasio giueth amp according to my degree for as touching to please god there is no work better then other god looketh not first on my works as the world doth or as though he had neede of them but god looketh first on my hart what faith i haue to his word how i beleeue him trust him and how i loue him for his mercie that he hath shewed mee hee looketh with what heart i work amp not what i work how i accept the degree hee hath put me in not of what degree i am let vs take an example you are a minister and preach the worde i am a kitchen boy amp wash my maisters dishes of the ministerie hark what the apostle saith if i preach i haue nought to reioice in for necessitie is put vpon mee if i preach not the gospel as who should saie god hath made me so woe is to me if i preach not if i do it willinglie saith he then i haue my reward that is then am i sure that god spirite is in me amp that i am elect to eternall life if i do it against my wil the office is committed to me that is if i do it not of loue to god but to get a liuing therby amp for a worldlie purpose amp had rather otherwise liue then do i that office which god hath put vpon mee but do not please god so then if you preached not or in preaching had not your hart aright you minister the office amp they that haue the spirit of god heare his word yes though it were spoke by an asse amp the woe belongeth to you but amp if you preach wil ingly with a true hart amp coscience to god then shal you feel the earnest of eternal life and the working of the spirit of god in you and your preaching is a good work in you now i that minister in the kitchin and am but a kitchin boy receiue all thinges at the hand of god knowe that god hath put me in such an office submit my selfe to his wil and serue my maister not as a man but as christ himselfe with a pure heart according as paul teacheth me putting my trust in god and of him seeke my reward moreouer there is not a good deede done but mine heart reioiseth therein yes when i heare that the word of god is preached by you and see the people turne vnto god i consent to this deede my heart breaketh out in me yes it springeth and leapeth in my breast that god is honoured and in my heart i doe the same that you doe with the like delectatio amp feruency of spirit now he that receiueth a prophet in the name of a prophet receiueth a prophets reward that is he that consenteth to the deede of a prophet and maintaineth it the same hath the same spirite and earnest of euerlasting life which the prophet hath and is elect as th prophet is nowe if wee compare worke to work there is a difference between washin of dishes and preaching the word of god but as touching to please god none at all for neither that nor this pleaseth god bu as farre foorth as god hath chosen a man and hath put his spirite in him and purified his heart by faith amp trust in christ as the scriptures call him carnall which is not renued by the spirit amp borne again in christs flesh amp al his works like euen the verie motions of his heart and mind as his learning doctrine and contemplation of hie things his preaching teaching and studie in the scripture building of churches founding of colledges giuing of almes and whatsoeuer he doth though they seeme spirituall amp after the law of god neuer so much so contrariwise he is spirituall which is renued in christ and all his workes which spring from faith seeme they neuer so grosse as the washing of the disciples feete done by our sauiour christ and peters fishing after the resurrection yes deedes of matrimonie are pure spirituall if they proceede of faith and whatsoeuer is done within the laws of god though it be wrought by the bodie as the verie wiping of shooes and such like howsoeuer grosse they appeare outwardlie yet are sanctified what be the speciall thinges in which you lead your conuersation one thing is the reading of the scripture it is dangerous to read the scriptures you that haue no learning may easilie fall into errors and heresies as he which knoweth his letters perfectlie and can spell cannot but read if he be diligent and as hee which hath cleare eies without impediment or let and walketh thereto in the light amp open daie cannot but see if he attend and take hede euen so i hauing the profession of my baptisme onelie written in my heart and feeling it sealed vp in my conscience by the holie ghost cannot but vnderstad the scripture because i exercise my selfe therein amp compare one place with another and marke the manner of speech and aske here and there the meaning of a sentence of them that be better exercised then i for i feele in my hart and haue a sensible experience of that inwardlie which the spirite of god hath deliuered in the scriptures so that i find mine own feeling as a good comentarie vnto me we are all baptized belike the we shall all vnderstand the scriptures but alas verie few there be that are taught amp feele their ingrafting into christ their iustification their inwarde dying vnto sin amp liuing vnto righteousnes which is the meaning of their baptisme and therefore we remaine all blinde generallie as well the great rabbins which brag of their learning as the poore vnlearned laie man and the scripture is become so darke vnto the that they grope for the dore amp can find no waie in amp it is become a maze vnto the in which they wader as in a mist or as we saie led by robin goodfellow and their darkenes can not comprehend the light of the scriptures but they read them as me do tales of robin hood as riddles or as olde priests read their ladies mattins which they vnderstand not and vntil a ma be taught his baptisme that his heart feele the sweetnes of it the scriptures are shut vp fro him amp so dark that he could not vnderstad it though peter paul or christ himself did expound it vnto him no more then a man starke blinde can see though thou set a candle before him or shew him the sun or point with thy finger vnto that thou wouldest haue him looke vpon as for heresie there is no danger if a man come to the scripture with a meeke spirit seeking there to fashion himselfe like vnto christ according to the profession and vowe of his baptisme but contrariwise hee shall there finde the mightie power of god to alter and chaunge him in the inner man by litle and litle til in processe he be full shapen after the image of our sauiour in knowledge and loue of all truth amp power to worke thereafter heresies spring not of scripture no more then darkenes of the sun but are darke cloudes which spring out of the blind hearts of hypocrites giuen to pride and singularitie and doe couer the face of the scripture and blind their eies that they cannot beholde the bright beames of the scripture by this i also can gather that the papists which cannot reade the scriptures except they fall into errours haue not the spirite of christ working in them and teaching them but the lying spirite of antichrist the diuel and that if god woulde giue them anie true feeling and open their eies they would quite change their minds but what other exercises haue you praier and thankesgiuing to god for god hath promised verie bountifullie vnto them which praie in truth and it is one of the greatest comforts i haue at all times again god which commandeth me not to steale commandeth me also to pray and his will is that one commandement should be as well kept as an other and therfore i am perswaded that condemnation will befall me as well for the one as for the other and that praier ought to be continuallie euen in euerie thing a man doth me thinketh it most agreeable to god will for if i shoulde come into my neighbours house and take his goods and vse them not borrowing them or asking anie leaue they would laie handes on mee and make mee a thiefe the world and all the thinges in the world are the lord not mine so then if i shall dailie vse them neuer seeking to the lorde by praier for the vse of them before god i am an vsurper nay a ranke thief and therfore i desire of god heartily that i may vse all his good creatures with feare and reuerence and that i may sanctifie his name in the which paule sheweth me to be done by the worde of god and praier the worde showing me the lawful vse of his creatures praier obtaining at god hands that i may vse them aright if this practise were vsed of man in their professions and callings i am perswaded there would be a thousand vices ut off which are in euerie ma most aboun ant and are committed without shame timoth i thinke the rest of your christi n exercises bee the practising of the commandements of the lawe yes they are indeed me thinkes it is an hard point of the law for a man to loue his enemie it is indeede yet in the faithfull it wilbe so for they haue in their harts a perswasion that wheras they are daned in theselues yet in christ the mercie of god is most plentiful to their saluation and all this god confirmeth and sealeth vnto them by his holie spirite and therefore they cannot but loue god again and that with a feruent loue euen aboue al things in the world and so they loue all god creatures and euen their enemy because they beare the image of god whom they loue like as if i haue a friend and loue him i loue all of his name all his kinred and all that appertaine vnto him and by the waie here is a good waie to know whether we haue faith or not though faith onelie iustifie and make the marriage betweene our soule and christ and is properlie the marriage garment yes and the signe tau that defendeth vs from the smiting and power of euill angels an is also the rocke on which christs churc is built and standeth against all weather o winde and tempest yet is faith neuer seu red from hope and charitie then if a man will be sure that his faith is perfect let him examine himselfe whether he loue the law and in like manner if he will know whether hee loue the lawe that is loue god and his neighbour then let him examine himselfe whether he beleeue in christ onelie for the remission of sin and obtaining the promises made in the scripture and euen so let him compare his hope of the life to come with faith and loue amp to the hatred of sin in his life which hatred the loue of the law ingendreth in him and if they accompanie not one another all three together then let him be sure all is but hypocrisie yet by your leaue faith cannot make a man iust before god without hope and charitie then they also with faith haue some stroke in iustification i answere though they be inseparable yet i praise god i doe conceiue howe these three haue three separable amp sundrie offices faith onlie is an vndoubted amp sure oue in christ amp in the father through him ertifieth the conscience that the sin is forgiue amp the danation of the law taken awaie and with such perswasions mollifieth the article amp maketh it loue god again amp his law and as oft as we sin faith only keepeth that we forsake not our profession and that loue vtterlie quench not amp hope faile amp onlie maketh the peace again for a true beleeuer trusteth in christ alone and not in his own workes nor ought else for the remission of sins the office of loue is to powre out againe the same goodnes that it hath receiued of god vpon hir neighbor to be to him as it feeleth christ to be to it self the office of loue is onelie to haue compassion and to beare with hir neighbour the burden of his infirmities pet loue couereth the multitude of sins that is to saie cosidereth the infirmities amp interpreteth al to the best amp taketh for no sin at al a thousand thinges of which the least were inough if a man loued not to goe to lawe for amp to trouble amp disquiet an whole towne and sometime a whole realme too the office of hope is to comfort in aduersitie and to make patient that we faint not nor fall downe vnder the crosse or cast it of our backes thus these three inseparable haue separable offices amp effects as heat amp drynes being inseparable in the fire haue yet their separable operations for drynes onelie expelleth the moistnes of all that is consumed by fire and hea onelie destroieth the coldnes and it is not all one to saie the drynes onelie and the drynes that is alone neither is it all one to saie faith onelie and faith that is alone you are to be commended you are so perfect in these high points of religion but i know you speake of experience for in you faith amp hope towardes god amp charity towards your neighbor are inseparable i require no commendations shame and confusion befall mee eternallie that all glorie may be vnto god but let vs talke on further of our dueties which we must performe if we will liue christian like among man and i praie you tell mee what doe you meane that you giue so much vnto the poore considering you are so poore your self i speake my conscience if you had abilitie you woulde doe more the an hundred of those rich man do god knowes my heart it is a hell vnto me to see my brother for whom christ shed his bloud to want if i haue anie thing in the world to giue him among christian man loue maketh all things common euerie man is others debter and euerie man is bound to minister to his neighbour and to supplie his neighbours lacke of that wherewith god hath indued him christ is lord ouer all amp euerie christian is heire annexed with christ amp therefore lord ouer all and euerie one is lord of whatsoeuer another hath if then my brother or neighbour need i haue to helpe him and if i shew not mercie but withdrawe my hands from him then rob i him of his owne amp am a thief a christia ma hath christs spirit now christ is merciful if i shall not be mercifull i haue not christs spirit if i haue not christs spirit the am i none of his and though i shew mercie vnto my brother yet if i doe it not with such burning loue as christ did vnto me i must knowledge my sinne and desire mercie in christ if a man must be franke and free then a man must giue of his owne stocke to the poore and diminish his own substance yes indeed we are made stewards of those goods which god hath giuen vs amp shal a steward take all vnto himself without reproof i am sure that they which were couetous at peters first sermon after christs ascention diminished their substance when they sold them amp gaue them to the poore i am sure that the churches which were in macedonia which sent reliefe vnto their churches euen aboue their abilitie they beeing in extreame pouertie did dimisse their possessions and god graunt our conuersations may be like theirs and that wee should be like the their examples of great compassion are recorded in the scriptures many of vs haue our selues wife children father mother amp kinsfolke to relieue so y t it wil be hard to deale after this manner had not these man i named so yes i warrat you had they and the wat of loue which you deeme of the gospell of christ knoweth not y t a ma should begin at himself amp the desced i wot not by what steps loue seeketh not hir own profit but maketh a ma to forget himself amp turn this profit to another ma as christ sought not himself or his own profit but ours this terme my self is not in the gospel neither yet father mother sister brother kinsma y t one should in loue be preferred before another the loue that springeth out of christ excludeth no man neither putteth difference betweene one amp other in christ wee are all of one degree without respect of persons notwithstanding though a christian mans hart be open to all man amp receiueth all man yet because his abilitie of goods extendeth not so farre this prouision is made that euerie man should care for his owne housholde as father mother thine elders that haue holpen thee wife children and servant when a man hath done his duetie to his houshold and yet hath further aboundance of the blessing of god that he oweth to the poore that cannot labour and cannot get worke and ar destitute of friendes to the poore i meane which he knoweth and to them of his owne parish for that prouision ought to be had in the church that euerie parish prouide for the poore if his neighbours which hee knoweth bee serued then is hee debter to the brother a thousand miles off if he heare of their necessity amp haue himself anie plentie yes to the verie infidel he is a debter if they need as farre forth as he doth not maintaine them against christ thus is euerie ma that needeth my help my father mother sister amp brother in christ euen as euerie man that doth the will of the father is father mother sister and brother vnto christ now ye somewhat perswade me of that which me thought at the first blush was against common sense by god grace i will perswade you more yet how if our sauiour christ iesus should now dwell vpon the earth in pouertie amp want could you not be contented to bestow halfe your goods on him halfe my goods nay truely all and my heart blood for i knowe if i should loose my life for him i should saue it verie well christ is all in all euerie christian man to another is christ himselfe and whatsoeuer is doone to the poore is doone to christ himselfe and therefore your neighbours neede hath as good right in your goods as hath christ himselfe which is heire and lord ouer all and looke what you owe to christ that you owe to your neighbours neede to your neighbour owe you your heart and life and whatsoeuer you haue or can doe wee need not giue our reliefe except the poore require it aske or not if they want you are bound to relieue them as christ loued you so loue them christ loued you being his enimie when i am sure of it you neuer asked remission of sinnes wee neede not releeue them often need we yes as long as you are able and as oft as they want if christ should forgiue vs but once we should come short of heauen the world is full of naughtines and lewde people take pleasure in dooing wrong and in slandering and in hindering their brother how can you liue among them in quietnes do you vse to giue like for like no you must vnderstand that there bee two states or regiments in the worlde the kingdome of heauen which is the regiment of the gospell and the regiment of the worlde which is the temporall kingdome in the first state there is neither father nor mother neither maister mistres maide nor servant nor husband nor wife nor lord nor subiect nor inferior woman but christ is all amp each to other is christe himself there is none better then other but all alike good all brother and christ onlie is lord ouer all neither is there any other thing to doo or other law saue to loue one another as christ loued in the temporall regiment is husband wife father mother son daughter mistres maide manseruant subiect lord now euery person is a double person and vnder two regimets in the first regiment i am a person of mine owne selfe vnder christe and his doctrine and maye neither hate nor be angrie and much lesse fighte or reuenge but must after the example of christe humble my selfe forsake and denie my selfe and hate my selfe and caste my selfe awaye and bee meeke and patient and let euery man goe ouer mee and treade mee vnderfoote and doo mee wronge and yet i am to loue them and praye for them as christ did for his crucifiers for loue is all and whatsoeuer is not of loue is damnable and cast foorth of that kingdome in the temporall regiment thou article a person in respect of an other thou article husband father mother daughter wife lord subiect and there thou must doe according to thine office if thou be a father thou must doe the office of a father and rule or else thou damnest thy selfe thou must bring all vnder obedience whether by faire meanes or by foule thou must haue obediencc of thy wife of thy servant and of thy subiects if they will not obeye in loue thou must chide fight and correct as farre as the lawe of god and the lawe of the lande will suffer thee now to the purpose whether a man maie resist violence and defend or reuenge himhimselfe i saie naie in the firste state where thou article a person for thy selfe alone and christs disciple there thou must loue and of loue doe studie and enforce yes amp suffer all thinges as christ did to make peace that the blessing of god may come vppon thee which saith blessed are the peacemakers for they shall bee the children of god if thou suffer amp keepe peace in thy selfe onely thy blessing is the possession of this worlde but if thou so loue the peace of thy brother that thou leaue nothing vndoone or vnsuffered to further it thou shalt possesse heauen but in this worldlie state where thou article no priuate man but a person in respect of other thou must and article bounde vnder paine of damnation to execute thine office of thy servant thou must exact obedience and must not suffer thy selfe to bee dispised if thou article a ruler thou must take imprison and sley to not of malice and hate to reuenge thy selfe but to defende thy subiectes and to maintaine thine office the ruler must not oppresse his subiects with rentes fines and customes at all neither pill them with taxes and such like to maintaine his owne lustes but bee louing and kinde vnto them as christ was to him for they be the price of his bloode i will shewe my minde more plainelie by one example you are in your fathers house among your brother and sisters there if one fight with another or if anie doe you wrong you maie not reuenge or smite for that pertaineth to the father onelie but if your father giue you authoritie in his absence and commaunde you to smite if they will not bee ruled but abuse you then you are another person notwithstanding yet you haue not put off the first person but are a brother still and must euer loue and proue all thinges to rule with loue but if loue wil not serue then you must vse the office of an other person or sinne against your father euen so when you are a temporall person you put not of the spirituall therefore you must euer loue but when loue will not helpe you must with loue execute the office of the temporall person you must loue your neighbour in your hart because he is your brother in the first state yet you must obeie your ruler who hath power ouer you and when neede requireth at his commandement you must goe with the constable or like officer and breake open your neighbors doore if hee will not open it in the kings name yes if he will not yeld in the kings name you maie smite him to the ground till he bee subdued and looke what harme he getteth that be vppon his owne heade i vnderstand you well as i am a member of the spirituall bodie of christ i must in all my conuersation follow him with patience meekenes and long suffering ouercomming other mens euils with weldoing yet if the hurt be greater then i can beare i must take a new person on me and if i be a ruler with loue seeke amendment if a subiect then in the feare of god complaine to my ruler but further i pray you soile me this doubt if i shall be taken for a soldier me thinks that i should then shake off all loue and meekenes amp then i could not practise this christian rule yes if our queene god saue her grace should send you on warfare into another country you must obeie at god commandement and go and auenge your princes quarrell which you knowe not but that it is right when you come thether remember the two stats in which you are and knowe that in the firste state that is the regiment spiritual you must loue them with whome you fight and that they are your brother bought with christes blood as well as you and for christes sake hate them not yet as you are in the second state a souldior at your princes commandement you must fight against them and mainteine your princes quarrell and bring them vnder hir power and therewithall be content with your princes wages neither desire your aduersaries life or goods saue to aduantage your prince so then a souldior neede not cast away meekenes for he may fight with his enemie and slaye him and yet loue him another thing i would knowe of you which now commeth to my minde i haue a landlord he seemeth to be a verye good man he countenanceth all the good prechers in our country amp he rideth vsually ten miles to hear sermons i hold of him an house amp a little land not scarse enough to find my poore family my lease is come out amp i haue taken a new lease but i haue paide such a great fine and my yearly rents are so racked that i feare i amp all my houshold are like to beg our bread this is it disquieteth me and almost maketh me at my wits end what is your counsell and aduise surelie it maketh my hearte to bleede to see how manie man bragge of the gospell and yet what little fruite the gospell hath in them and what little loue they shew euen they which abound in rents and landes my poore aduise is this that you would with patience depende vppon god prouidence it is said blessed are the meeke for they shall inherite the earth then let all the world studie to doe you wronge yes let them studie to bring you to extreeme miserie and doe it too yet if you bee meeke you shall haue foode and raiment enough for you amp yours and no doubt god who is alwaies true of his promise shall raise vp some to helpe you and my counsell is that you giue your landlorde now and then a capon now a pigge now a goose and if you bee able a lambe or a calfe and let your wife visite your land ladie nowe and then with spiced cakes with apples peares cheries and such like and bee you readie with your oxen or horse fiue or sixe times in the yeare to fetch home thei wood to plowe their land then no doubt god maie soften their hartes amp moue them to haue some pittie amp compassion on your oore estate i haue done all this naie maie t be spoken betweene you and me i am at commandement amp am as a drudge to the o do their busines and to leaue my owne ndone and yet haue neither meat drinke or monie more is the pittie but remember hat they which cannot come to see man eale vprightly in the world yet do in their arts hunger and thirst after this righteous es are pronounced blessed to let this passe shew me one ule howe i might generallie in all matters e haue my selfe among man and then for his time i will cease to trouble you aske your own conscience what ou maie or ought to do would you man id so with you then doe you it would ou not bee so delt with then doe it not ou would not that man should doe you rong and oppresse you you would not at man should doe you shame amp rebuke e on you kil you haue your house fro you tice your servant away or take against ur wil ought that is yours you wold not at me shold sell you false ware when you put the in trust to make it readie or to lay it out for you and you woulde not that man should deceiue you with great othes swearing that to be good which is indeed verie nought you would not that man should sel you ware that is nought amp too dere to vndoo you doe no such thing then vnto your neighbours but as loth as you woulde bee to buie false ware and too deere for vndoing your selfe so loth bee you to sell false ware or too deere for vndooing your neighbor and in al cases how glad would you be to bee holpen so glad bee to helpe your neighbour so in all things aske your conscience what is to bee done betweene your neighbour and you and she wil teach you but because you are wearie of reasoning i will also end desiring god to encrease in vs his heauenlie graces as faith and repentance and loue according to his good pleasure a reprobate may in truth be made partaker of all that is contained in the religion of the church of rome and a papist by his religion cannot goe beyong a reprobate he which may in truth be made partaker of the chiefe pointes of the popish religion may bee made partaker of all but a reprobate may be made partaker of the chiefe points of the popish religion therefore a reprobate may be made partaker of all the proposition is plaine and euerie papist will graunt it all the controuersie is of the assumption wherefore i prooue thus the sacrament of penaunce as they all it is one of the chiefe thinges in the ligion of the church of rome for it is such a sacrament catech rom pag that by the power amp efficacie of it the bloude of christ is deliuered to vs to washe awaie our sinnes and they saie ibid pag tho dist quest article canis amp pec exp it hath such vertue that the kingdome of heauen is promised to it in the scriptures and that it is not regeneration but an healing of a man regeneration but an healing of a man regenerate amp that it pardoneth sin as baptisme and as touching contrition papistes write catech rom pag lumb lib dist it hath power to do away sinne and to obtein pardon at god hand the same they speake o confession which they saie deliuereth from death openeth paradise and giueth hop of saluation and hereby it maie appeare that penance is one of the greatest pointe of the popish religion but a reprobate maie be truely made partaker of the popish sacrament of penance amp indeed performe all in it there be three partes of penaunce contrition of the heart confession of the mouth satisfaction in th deed all these three iudas performed fir he had contrition for when he saw that o sauiour christ was condemned math ver then he saw his owne sinne and was striken with griefe for his owne treacherie amp repente and presentlie after he ver confessed his sin openly vnto the chiefe priestes and elder also he made satisfaction when he brought againe the thirtie peeces of siluer which he tooke to betraie his maister again contrition of the hart is the ground of penaunce amp papists saie it is not an act of the holy ghost carec rom pag but an act of mans freewil proceding fro it amp therfore a reprobate may haue it and as for satisfaction if a reprobate canot do it by himself yet he may performe it by another for so they saie tho li dist qu article that one may satisfie by an other wherfore for anie thing i ca see a reprobate may haue al that is coteined in the popish sacramet of penance faith is an other of the chiefest points that is the religio of the church of rome for trid consil sess cap rhem te rom they saie it is the foundatio amp groundwork of iustificatio but reprobats may haue that faith which they meane for they say that it is nothing els but canis oper ca pa a gift of god amp a certain light of the mind wherwith a ma be ing enlightned giueth sure amp certain assent to y e reuealed word of god and the rhemists say it is onely an acte of the vnderstanding and andradius saith that faith is onely in generall actions and can not come to the particular applying of anie thing now all this reprobates maie haue heb luke iam for their minds are englightened to know the trueth and to be perswaded of it and therfore they haue this acte of the vnderstanding and this generall faith yes the diuell himselfe can do thus much who beleeueth amp trembleth and the implicite faith which saueth the laye man what reprobate cannot haue it for there is nothing else required but to beleeue as the church beleeueth though he know not howe the church beleeueth and the papistes themselues say as much for their trid co sess cap andr lib pag councels hold that a wicked ma and an heretike maye haue confidence in christ and that an heathen man by the naturall knowledge of god and by the works of creation might haue faith and in a generall manner beleeue in christ that religion whose precepts are no directions to attaine peace of conscience leaueth a max still in a damnable case but the precepts of the religion of the church of rome are no directions to attaine peace of conscience therefore it leaueth a man in a damnable case which if it be true a reprobate may bee as sound a professor of it as anye other the proposition is certaine because as long as any man hath his conscience to accuse him of sinne before god hee is in state of damnation ioh as s john saith if our hart condemne vs god is greater than our hart and knoweth all things and this is peculiar and proper to the elect children of god rom to receiue these gifts and graces fro god heb the enioying of which bringeth peace of conscience true it is indeed that reprobates receiue many graces and giftes at god hand but they are no other then such as may be ioyned with the trembling of the conscience as the deuill is said to beleeue but withall to tremble the assumption namely that the religion of the church of rome cannot pacifie the conscience may be easily prooued on this wise a man whose conscience must be truely quieted must first of all be truely humbled math come vnto me saith our sauiour christ all yee which are wearied and burdened and i will ease you whereby it appeareth that they who are to haue their consciences refreshed in christ must first of all be afflicted with the sense of god iudgement yes they must be pressed down to helward with the weight amp burden of their sins that they may see it amp from their hearts confesse it that in theselues there is no way to escape damnation the good phisition christ iesus cannot heale vs before he hath lached our wounds to the very bottom he neuer can find any of his sheepe before they be quite lost hee neuer powreth into vs the liuing water of his spirit before we be barren amp dry ground voide of all moisture amp that ma must condene himself that wold not haue christ to pronounce sentece of danatio against him now this true humiliation of a sinner ca not be wrought in any mans hart by the religion of the church of rome true amp soud humiliation is wrought by two meanes first by making a man to see the greatnes of his sinne and wickednesse secondly by making him to acknowledge that he is destitute amp quite bereft of all goodnes for if a man either see not the greatnes of his sin or haue confidece of any thing in himself he canot be humbled but neither of these things are performed in the church of rome as touching the first the roman rel gion is so farre fro amplifying amp enlarging the greatnes of mens sins that it doth extenuate the and lessen them out of measure for it maketh some sinnes to be veniall gal when as the least sinne that can bee against god lawe deserueth damnation canis ope cat pag it teacheth that less sinnes are doone away by an humble accusation of a mans self by saying the lord praier by knocking vpon the breast and by such like that greater sinnes may be doone away by almes deeds and such like satisfactions but how can any sinne be great that may bee doone awaie with such easie and sleighr meanes furthermore it teacheth that euill thoughts amp desires and motions of the heart without consent are no sinnes and this opinion cutteth off all true humiliation for rom paule neuer repented before he vnderstood the meaning of the last commandement amp perceiued thereby that the desires and lusts of his hart to which he did not yeeld his consent were sinnes damnable before god and knowing this he then saw himself to be most miserable amp renoucing his owne righteousnes he sought for righteousnes in christ lastly conc colon pag it teacheth that originall sinne is done away in baptisme and that is the least sinne of all other what is this but to extenuate mas corruption for when the root of corruptio is take away and it is made so little a sinne actuall sinnes cannot bee taken for such heinous matters and for the second point the church of rome dooth too too much extoll the power of man and his naturall strength andr li trid con sess ca it saith that all actions of man vnregenerate are not sinnes and that originall sinne needeth no repentance trid co sess ca that a man hath some free will to do spirituall things that gabr biel sen dist a man by meere naturales may loue god aboue all things feare god beleeue in christ if we respect the very acte of the worke andr lib pa that the gentiles might gather out of philosophie knowledge sufficient for saluatio andr lib p that a man without the helpe of the holy ghost may performe things acceptable to god catech rom in prim that the minde of man vnderstandeth of it selfe manye things which be spirituall and heauenly trid co sess c that a man regenerate may fulfill the whole lawe of god that a man may prepare himself to receiue grace amp to merit grace at god hands that he may do works of supererogation ampc by this it appeareth y t the church of rome ascribeth to much to the nature of ma gen ephesians which is only amp altogether euill dead in sinne chained vp in miserable bodage vnder satha the prince of darknes and therefore it is euident that all the preaching that is vsed in that church will not humble a sinner and make him denie himselfe amp therefore their preaching may peraduenture benumme a corrupt conscience and make it secure but it cannot pacifie the troubled conscience nor disquiet it by the threatnings of the law that by the promises of the gospell it maie be quieted againe trid con sess cap this religion teacheth that a man must doubt of his saluation as long as he is in this life behold a racke or gibbet erected by the church of rome for the tormenting of tender consciences for when a man doubteth of his saluatio he also doubteth of god loue and mercie to him amp he which doubteth of god loue cannot loue god again for how can anie man loue him of whose good will he doubteth and when a man hath not the loue of god in him he hath no grace in him amp therefore his conscience must needes be defiled and voide of true peace yes he must needes be a wicked man and that pro saying of salomon must needes agree to him the wicked flieth whe no man pursueth by reason of the guiltines of his conscience but the godlie is bold as a lion againe blessed is the man saith dauid whose sinnes are pardoned where hee maketh remission of sinnes to bee true felicitie nowe there is no true felicitie but that which is inioied and felicitie cannot be inioied vnlesse it bee felt and it cannot be felt vnlesse a man know himselfe to be in possession of it amp a man cannot know himselfe to be in possession of it if he doubt whether hee hath it or not and therefore this doubting of the remission of sinnes is contrarie to true felicitie amp is nothing else but a torment of the conscience for a man cannot doubt whether his sinnes be pardoned or not but strait waie if his conscience bee not seared with an hoat iron the verie thought of his sinne will strike a great feare into him for the feare of eternall death and the horror of god iudgements will come to his remembrance the consideration of which is most terrible vndoubtedlie this religion must needes be comfortlesse alas poore man as we are we are no better then passengers in this worlde our waie it is in the middle of the sea where wee can haue no sure footing at all and which waie so euer wee cast our eies wee see nothing but water euen opening it selfe to deuoure vs quicke the diuell and our rebellious flesh raise vp against vs infinite thousandes of tempestes and stormes to ouerthrowe vs but beholde god of his great and endlesse mercie hath brought vs to christ as to a sure ancker holde hee bibddeth vs to vndoo our gables and fling vp our anckers within the vaile and fasten them in christ we do it as we are commanded but a sister of ours i meane the church of rome passing in the ship with vs as it seemeth who hath long taken vppon hir to rule the healme dealeth too too vnkindelie with vs shee vnlooseth our anckers and cutteth in pieces our gables shee telleth vs that wee maie not presume to fasten our ancker on the rocke shee will haue vs freelie to roue in the middle of the sea in the greatest fogges and the fearefullest tempestes that bee if wee shall follow hir aduise wee must needes looke for a shippewracke for the least flawe of winde shall ouerturne vs and our poore soules shall bee plunged in the gulphs of hell lastlie iustificatio by works causeth trouble amp disquietnes to the coscience no mas conscience can bee appeased before god wrath be appeased amp god wrath canot be appeased by anie workes for the best works the regenerate can doe are imperfect and are stained with some blemish of corruption as isaiah rom may appeare both in the prophet esai and in paule both which had a great misliking of that good which they did because it was mingled with sin and againe euerie man is bound by duetie to keepe the whole lawe so that if a man could keepe it perfectlie he should doe no more then that he is by duetie inioined to doe and therefore he which looketh to merite eternal life at god hand by keeping the lawe trusteth but to a broken staffe and is like the bankrupt that will paie one debt by another for by his sinne euerie man is indebted to the lord and is bound to answere to the lord the full punishment of all his sinnes this debt the papist saith we maie discharge by obedience to the law that is by a new debt which we are as well bounde to paie to our god as the former to end this point let a man looke to bee saued by works and therefore let a man imploie himselfe to do the best works he can yet he shall neuer come to knowe when he hath done sufficient to satisfie god wrath and this vncertaintie all his life but especiallie in the houre of death must needes disquiet him and truelie when a man shall haue done manie thousand workes yet his heart can neuer be at quiet as it appeareth in the young man who though hee had laboured all his life to fulfill the law thereby to be saued yet distrusting all his doings he asketh further of our sauiour christ what he might doe to be saued furthermore it is the doctrine of the church of rome that there is nothing in the regenerate that god can hate and that they are inwardlie pure and without spot a doctrine that will make anie christian conscience dispaire for if a man shall fall to examine himselfe he shall finde rom that he is sold vnder sinne heb compassed about of sinne psalm hee shall see his particular sinnes to be as the heires of his head at the sight and feeling of which he shal find that there is much matter in him worthie of hatred amp damnation too hee beeing in this case will begin to doubt whether he be the childe of god or not and perseuering in this doubting he shall be driuen to dispaire of god loue towards him considering that he cannot finde anie such purenes in himselfe as the doctrine of the church of rome requireth lastlie experience it selfe teacheth that the roman religion can bring no peace to the conscience in that some for the maintaining of it haue dispaired as frauces spira who against his own coscience hauing abiured the truth and subscribed to the doctrine of the roman church most fearefullie dispaired of his saluation which coulde not haue beene if that doctrine had been agreeable to god word which is spirite and life to the receiuer for the same cause latomus a doctor of louane dispaired crying that he was damned because he had opposed himselfe to the knowen truth this also befell gardner at his death as the booke of acts and monuments declareth that religion which agreeth to the corruption of mans nature a reprobate maie truelie professe it the religion of the church of rome agreeth to the corruption of mans nature therefore a reprobate maie truelie professe it i neede not stand to prooue the proposition the assumption is rather to bee confirmed which first i will proue by induction of particulars that a man should be iustified by workes is an opinion settled in nature as maie appeare in them that crucified our sauiour christ for when they were pricked in their hearts at peters sermon acts ioh mat they saide man and bretheren what shall we doe to bee saued and this saide the young man before named not what should i beleeue but what should i do to be saued for that in them it appeareth that it is a naturall opinion of all man to thinke that they must bee saued by dooing of somewhat a papist wil saie though this be naturall thus to thinke yet it maie bee good for there is some goodnes in nature i answere that the wisedome of the flesh is enmitie to god wisedome rom and all man by nature are nothing but flesh for naturallie they are the children of wrath the worshipping of god in images is a great matter in the church of rome but this maner of worshipping is nothing but a worke of the flesh which thus i proue gal idolatry is natural and a worke of the flesh but to worship god in images is idolatry the children of israell when they erected the golden calfe they did commit idolatry and yet they did not worship the calfe it selfe but god in the calfe for when th calfe was made they exo proclaimed an holidaie not to the calfe but to the lorde and baal that detestable idol was nothing but the image of god as appeareth in hosea the prophet at that daie saith th the lorde thou shalt call mee no mo baal it remaineth therefore that to serue go in an image is a work of the flesh and altogether agreeth to the vile corruption nature mat pride and a desire to be adua ced aboue other is a naturall corruption this agreeth the popes primacie his do ble sword and triple crowne yes the ou ragious pompe of that seate is as a paire o bellowes to kindle the concupiscence and to make the hidden sparkes of pride to breake out into a great flame doubting of god prouidence and mercie is naturall corruption in all man to this agreeth and from hence issueth that foolis and vaine opinion concerning doubting our saluation and of the remission of sinne selfeloue and selfeliking or naturall co ruptions to this agreeth that doctrine the papistes not ouermuch to abase ou selues but to maintaine free will by nature and to thinke that we haue so much goodnes that wee are able to prepare our selues to receiue and in some sort to merit grace idlenes and riotousnes is a corruption naturall and to it verie fitlie answereth the great number of feasts of holidaies of halfe holidaies which the church of rome vseth couetousnes is a natural corruption and o the feeding of this vice serueth purgato ie a fire of great gain which in verie truth f it had not burned very hoat the fire in the popes kitchin had burned verie colde hi herto serue pilgrimages saying of masses nd selling of pardons for money to be t libertie is the desire of nature answerable o this is that opinio that the spiritualitie is o bee exempted from subiection to magistrates to commit adulterie is naturall to this agreeth the stewes and the permission of simple fornication ignorance is a filthie corruption in nature this the church of rome maketh the mother of deuotion and it is inioined the laie man as a means of his saluatio for he must beleeue as the church beleueth he is not bound to know infidelitie is naturall and to this agreeth that they cal vpo saints amp angels the lord hauing commanded them to call vpon him in the name of christ what argueth this els but hearts distrusting god goodnes and guilty consciences images in the church of rome came from infidelitie because man in reason coulde no perswade themselues that god was presen vnlesse that were made manifest by som signe and image which thing the israelites declared when they saide to aaron the wildernes in moses absence make god to go before vs satisfactions fo sinne are naturall for wicked man whe they haue offended god they haue alwai vsed some ceremonies to pacifie god with which when they haue performed the they think they haue done inough th church of rome saith that the scripture are darke and obscure the blinde man fin deth fault with the darkenes of the sun if the scriptures appeare to anie to bee obscure the fault is not in the scriptures bu in the blindnes of the minde of him whic readeth and heareth them lastlie pardons they open a gappe to all licentiou nes therefore they agree to mans corrup nature for who almost will not sinne whe he maie get a pardon for his sinnes for a li tle piece of money as twentie shillings or foure nobles it is naturall to a man to serue god in certaine ceremonies without the power of godlines amp this seruice is prescribed by the religion of the church of rome which standeth onelie in outward and corporall ceremonies as the outwarde succession of bishops garments vestures gestures colours choise of meate difference of daies times and places hearing seeing saying touching tasting numbring of beades gilding and worshipping of images building monasteries rising at midnight silence in cloisters abstaining fr flesh and whitmeat fasting in lent keeping imberdaies hearing masse and diuine seruice seeing and adoring the bodie in forme of bread receiuing holie water and holie breade creeping to the crosse carrying palmes taking ashes bearing candles pilgrimage going censing kneeling knocking al ers superalters candlestickes pardons in orders crossing annointing shauing for swearing ma i ge in baptisme salting crossing spatling ex i ng washing of hands at easter confessio irge satisfaction and in receauing with ew shauen to imagine a bodie where they nd though he were there present to bee seene he outwarde seeing and touching of him of ithout faith conduceth no more then it did iewes at rogation daies to carrie banners to follow the crosse to walke about the fields after pentecost to goe about with corpus christi plaie at hallowmas to watch in the church to saie a dirge or commendation and to ring for all soules to pa tithes truelie to giue to the high altar and if a man will bee a priest to sa e masse and mattens to serue the saint of that daie and to lif well ouer the heade in sickenesse to bee anneled to take his rites after his death t haue funerall and obites saide for him an to bee rong for at his funerall moneths minde and yeare minde this is the summe o the catholique religion standing in bodilie actions not in anie motion or woorke o the holie ghost woorking in th heart the morall lawe conteining perfect righteousnesse is flatte opposite to mans corrupt nature therefore whatsoeue religion shall repeale and make of none effect the commaundements of the morall lawe that same religion must neede ioine handes with the corruption of nature and stand for the maintenance of it this doth the religion of the church o rome it maie bee it doth not plaineli repeale them yet in effect it doth mat an if it shall frustrate but anye one pointe of anye one commaundement the whole commaundement yes the whole law therby is made in vaine the first commandement requireth that wee haue the true iehoua for our onely god the church of rome maketh other god beside this true god it maketh the bodie of christ to be god because they hold it may be in many places in heauen in earth at the same time which thing is onely proper to god it maketh euery saint departed to bee god because it holdeth that saintes doo heare vs now being vpon the earth and that they knowe our thoughtes when wee praye to them which none but the true god can doo it maketh the pope to bee god and that in plaine woordes dec dist satis euidenter pope nicholas saith constat summum pontificem pio principe constantino deum appellari it is well knowne that the pope of the godlie prince constantine was called god againe in extraua ioh cu inter in glossa the extrauagants of the same cannon lawe it is written dominus deus noster papa our lorde god the pope and againe concil later sess christopher marcellus saide to the pope tu es alter deus in erris thou article another god vpon earth amp the pope toke it to himself as the pope in plaine words is made god so the power giuen to him declareth the same hee can make holie that which is vnholie amp iustifie the wicked and pardon sins dist can lect in gloss dist can presb hee maie dispense contrary to the saying of an apostle he can change the nature of things and of nothing make somewhat what is all this but to place the pope in god roome and to rob the lord of his maiestie againe the church of rome maketh marie the mother of iesus to be as god in the breuiarie reformed amp published at the commandement of pius in officio par beatae mariae ad matut shee is called a goddes in expresse words and she is further tearmed the queene of heauen the queene of the world the gate of heauen the mother of grace and mercie yes shee is farre exalted aboue christ and he in regarde of her is made but a poore vnderling in heauen for papistes in their seruice vnto her they praie on this manner saying shew thy selfe to bee a mother and cause thy son to receiue our prayers set free the captiues and giue light to the blinde breuiar refor infesto exalt crucis lastlie the verie crosse is made as a god for they salute it by the name of their onelie hope and praie it to increase iustice to the godlie and to giue sinners pardon wherefore the church of rome beside the one true god distinguished into three persons the father the son the holy ghost maketh also manie other and so in truthe hath repealed this first commandement and they haue verie plainely repealed the second commandement in that they teach it lawful to make images of the true god and to worship him in them for the flat contrarie is the verie scope of this commandement namelie that no image must be made of the true iehoua nor any worship be performed vnto him in an image which appeareth thus in deutronomie moyses maketh a large commentarie of this commandement and this verie point he sets downe expresselie saying take heed to your selues for yee sawe no image in the day that the lord spake vnto you in horeb out of the middest of the fire that yee corrupt not your selues and make you a grauen image or representation of anie figure ampc his argument i set downe thus as god appeared in mount horeb so he is to be coceiued and represented but he appeared in no image in mount horeb onelie his voice was hard therefore he is not to be conceiued or represented in anie image but man are to bee content if they may heare his voice againe that sinne to which the people of israell were speciallie giuen euen that dooth the lorde especially forbid but to this were the people of israell speciallie giuen not so much to make images of false god as to make images of the true god and to worship him in them which i proue thus in the booke of iudges it is saide that the children of israell did wickedlye in the sight of the lord and serued baalim now these baalim what are they surely idoles resembling the true god as the prophet hosea declareth and at that daie saith the lord thou shalt call me ishai and shalt call mee no more baali heere it appeareth that the israelites meaning was not to worship a false god but the true god in baalim and aaron when he made the golden calfe proclaimed that the next daye should be holie daie not of anie false god but of the lorde that brought them out of egypt the prophet esaie after that he had set foorth god maiestie verie worthelye he comes in with this conclusion to whome then will yee liken god or what similitude will yee set vp of him which declareth that the iewes after the manner of the gentiles ran a whoring after idoles that is images not onely of false god but also of the true god i conclude therefore as i began that the church of rome by maintaining images hath repealed this commaundement neither dooth it shewe lesse fauour to the third commaundement which also is repealed first in that they teach man to giue the glorie which is proper to god to some thing else it is proper to god after the daie of iudgement to be all in all this they giue to marie saying that shee is all in all it is proper to christe in respect of other creatures to bee a light lightning all that come into the worlde yet they praye to marie to giue light to the blinde it is proper to christe to bee the redeemer of mankinde and this worke of redemption is ascribed to marie whome papists call their hope their ioye their mediatresse a medecine for the diseased a defence from the enemie a friend in the houre of death againe they make saint martin a priest according to the order of melchisedecke which is proper to christe secondly they holde that the people is to be barred from the reading of the scriptures vnlesse it be in an vnknowne tongue and so they mainteine ignorance and the profaning of god name for the free preching of the worde and therefore also the hearing learning reading searching of it is the glorifiyng of the word and so the glorifying of god name the fourth commaundement is repealed in that they require that their feast daies should be kept as solemnlie as the lord sabaoth day for they must be kept in all honour and comlines and man must rest from all their laboures from morning to euening as on the sabaoth whereas contrariwise the lord hath giuen permission to his servant to labour the sixe daies sobeit on the seauenth they wil rest from the works of their callings and do the workes of the spirit they repeale the fift commaundement in that they teach that their cleargie hath an immunitie and therfore is not bound to performe obedience to magistrates for so they haue decreed that clarkes are to be iudged onely of bishops and that they are onely to reskue them from iniuries againe that the bishop must not bee iudged of the secular power and that the pope himselfe oweth no subiection to kings princes emperors but hath power to make them and to put them downe at his pleasure but s paule for the maintening of the fift commandement bids euery soule be subiect to the higher powers and therefore the pope with his cleargie as chrysostom hath expounded it must be subiect to ciuill magistrates vnlesse they wil exclude themselues out of the number of man for paul speakes to all against the sixte commandement they haue decreed asyles for murderers plainly permitting them which feare authoritie to haue safetie in the lap of their mother the church thus they annihillat god commandement yes and more then this whether tends all that they teach but the very murthering of soules for example saluation by workes of grace is one of their chiefe oints but that man that is perswaded that he must be saued by his workes must also ut his trust in them and he which trusteth o his workes is accursed before god for ursed is that man that trusteth in man whether t be himselfe or other the seauenth commaundement is re ealed diverse waies first in that they maintaine the occasions of adulterie and fornication namelie the vowe of single life both in man and woman when as they haue not receiued the gift from god to be continent which gift when they want amp yet are boud to single life they must needs breake out into much loosenesse this sin made mantuan palingenius and petrarch to crie out against the church of rome againe some papistes defende the tolleration of the stewes in rome for the auoiding of greater euils and in the councell of trent chastitie and priestes marriage are made opposite so that marriage with the is a filthie thing although god hath ordained it for the auoiding of fornication in all furthermore that which is most abhominable and proues the church of rome to be an antichristian church they maintaine marriages within the degrees forbidden both by the law of nature and of god word for in the table of consanguinitie they which are placed in the transuerse vnequall line cannot marrie because they are as parents and children yet if they bee distant foure degrees on diverse sids from the common stocke they may marrie together by the cannon lawe as for example the graund vncle maie marrie his sisters nephewes neece a thing verie filthie in nature considering that a man cannot marry with any honestie his sisters child to go further by god word they which are distat degrees in the transuerse equall line may marrie together as cosin germanes thus the daughters of zelophehad were married to t eir fathers brothers son this example i take it is warrant of the lawfulnesse of this marriage else where yet the cannon lawe condemnes this marriage of cousin germanes and the marriage of their children after them though they bee eight degrees distant thus the church of rome doth ouerwhart the lord where he giues liberrie they restraine it and when hee restrai eth man then they giue libertie they repeale the eight commandement by their spirituall marchandize in which they sell those things which are not to bee solde as crosses to deade man images praiers the sound of belles remission of sinnes and the merites by which man maie come to the kingdome of heauen their shaueling priests will do no duetie without they be feed with monie hence comes the rouerbe no pennie no pater noster they teach man to beare false witnesse and so to sinne against the ninth commandement in that they holde that marie is the queene of heauen whereas indeede shee is no queene but doth continuallie cast downe hir crowne before christ with the rest of the saintes and a man may as wel beare false witnes in speaking too much as in speaking too little in the tenth commandement the first motions that go before consent are forbidden otherwise there shall be no difference betweene it and the rest for they also are spirituall and forbid inward motions but the difference is that they forbidde onelie the motions that goe with consent now the papistes saie that these motion are no sinne properlie vnlesse consent followe and therefore they in expresse words repeale this commandement for if concupi cence and the first motions bee no sinnes properlie then there neede no prohibition of them that religion which is contrarie to it selfe onelie a meere inuention of man the religion the church of rome is quite contrarie to it self herefore it is onely an inuenti on of man which if t be true as well a reprobate as any other may performe the things required in it the proposition is most true because it is a priuiledge of god worde and so of he true religion gathered foorth of it to be consonant to it selfe in al points which pro erly no doctrines nor writings beside can aue the assumption may bee made ma ifest by an induction of particular exam les the church of rome saith that man re saued by grace and againe it saith that man are saued by works a flat contradicti n for paule saith if election be of grace it s no more of workes or els were grace no more grace but if it bee of workes it is no more grace for els were worke no more worke answer is made y t in this place paul speaketh of workes of nature which indeed re contrarie to grace but not of workes of regeneration which are not contrarie to grace this answer is false for paul in a like lace vnto this opposeth grace amp works of regeneration yee are saued by grace saith he through faith and that not of your selues for it is the gift of god not of works least any should boast himselfe for we are his workmanship created in christe iesus vnto good workes that we should walke in them now let the church of rome speake what are the workes of which a man may most of all boast and what are the work for the doing of which we must be fashioned a new in christ iesus assuredly the must be the works of regeneratio dipped amp died in the bloud of christ as they speake wherefore it is euident that pauls meanin is to conclude that if we be saued by grace we canot be saued by works of regeneratio the church of rome confuteth an condemneth in councels amp derideth thi doctrine that we teach that man are to b iustified by the imputation of the righteou nes of christ which righteousnes is not i vs but in christ and the rhemists call it phantasticall iustice a new no iustice b herein that church is contrary to it self fo it defendeth workes of supererogation an works of satisfactio of one ma for an othe amp their ground is because the faithfull all mebers of one bodie amp haue fellowshi one with an other amp therefore one may satisfie for an other heereby it is plaine that the church of rome most of all defendeth that imputation of righteousnesse which most of all it hath oppugned for when one man satisfieth for an other the worke of one ma is imputed to another but what shall one ma satisfie for an other amp shal not christ by his righteousnes satisfie for vs shall god accept the worke of one man for an other amp not acept the righteousnes of christ for vs truely there is greater fellowship and coniunction betweene the head and the members than of the members among themselues because they are ioyned together by meanes of the head it holdeth that the guilt amp fault of sin may be remitted by christ amp yet the temporall punishment of sinne be vnremitted but these are quite cotrarie paul saith there is now no condemnation to them that are in christ iesus yet if a man were punished for his sinne after he were in christ amp had the fault of sin remitted some condemnation should now remaine him and dauid saith blessed is the man to whom the lord imputeth no sin therefore he to whom the lord imputeth no sinne hath not only the guilt of sinne but also the punishment of his sinne remitted otherwise he could not be blessed but miserable and this agreeth not with god iustice whe the fault is quite pardoned and a man is guiltie of no sinne that then anie punishment should be laide on him and s augustine saith that christ by taking vpon him the punishment of sin and not taking vpon him the fault tooke awaie both the punishment and the fault wherefore this opinion that christ hath taken awaie the guilt of sinne ouerthroweth al satisfactions amp purgatorie bicause the fault and guilt being taken away all punishment for sinne is also taken away transubstantiation is a monster standing on manifolde contradictions first it maketh christes bodie to bee in manie places an euident contradiction for it is of the nature and essence of a bodie to be in one place only which i proue thus a bodie is a magnitude a magnitude is a continued quantitie a continued quantitie cannot be but in one place therefore a bodie cannot be but in one place in this argumet the doubt is only of the last part which vndoubted is most true for it is called a continued quantitie because his parts are continued and knit together the one with an other by a common terme or bond as a line by a point a plane and his parts by a line a solide by a superficies or plane now these points ca in no wise be cotinued vnles euery one of the keepe one only special place for examples sake supose the plane a b c d to be deuided into partes l k l by two lines e g f h which doe both deuide the three partes amp continue the the one with the other now i saie that euerie one of the parts maie be continued with his next fellow it is necessarie that euerie one of them should haue one special and distinct place that the first place of the plane i maie be continued with k it must be situated only there where it is and no where els for if it shall be situate elswhere as in the place m then it cannot be continued with k nowe then if the partes must of necessitie haue their owne particular place onely then the whole figure a b c d must also be onely in one place and this is that which the prince of philosophers teacheth that euerie magnitude hath his partes sited in some one place one by an other so that a man maie saie of them here it is amp there it is not to conclude therefore this must need agree to a bodie and to the parts of it to be in one onely place alone so that the church of rome when it saith that christs bodie is in many places in effect they say that christs bodie is no bodie for if it be a body it is only in one place amp if it be in many places it is no bodie they obiect that god is omnipotent true indeede but there bee some things the doing of which agreth not with god power as to make contradicentia things contradictorie to bee both true of which sort these are for that christes bodie is a true bodie and that it is in manie places at once are flat contrarie because as hath ben shewed it is essentiall to all magnituds to be in one place and therefore to a bodie and god cannot take away that which is essentiall to a thing the essence remaining whole again transubstantiation maketh the accidents of breade and wine to remaine without the substance here also is another contradiction as impossible as the former for it is a comon saying in scholes accidentis esse est inesse it is of the essence of an accident to be in the substance nowe therefore if the accidents bee there is also the bread and wine and if there be no substance of bread or wine neither can there be anie accidents it holdeth that bread is turned into the bodie of christ amp therefore it must needs holde that christs body is made of bakers bread and yet it holdeth and teacheth that christes bodie is onelie made of the seed of mary quite ouerthrowing the former transubstantiation it teacheth that a man must alwaies doubt of his saluation and likwise it teacheth that in praying we are to call god father which are things quite contrarie for who can truely call god father vnlesse he haue the spirite of adoption and be assured that hee is the childe of god for if a man shall call god father and yet in his heart doubt whether hee bee his father or not he plaieth the dissembling hypocrite wherefore to doubt of saluation and to say our father ampc in truth are contrarie the church of rome maketh praier to be one of the chiefe means to satisfie for sinnes but praier indeede is an asking of pardon for sinne now asking of pardon and satisfaction for sinne are contrary therfore by the iudgement of the papists praier which is a satisfaction is no satisfaction and in deed let vs consider what madnesse is conteined in this popish diuinitie the poore begger commeth very hungry to the rich mans doore to craue his almes and straightwaies by his begging he will merit and deserue it the same dooth the papist he praieth very poorely for the thing which he wanteth yet he looketh very proudly to merite no lesse than the kindome of heauen by it doubting of saluation and hope cannot agree together for hope maketh a man not to be ashamed that is it neuer disappointeth him of the thing which he looketh for and therefore it is called the anchor of the soule both sure amp stedfast which entreth into that which is within the vaile so that true hope and the certaine assurance of saluation goe together true praier and iustification by works cannot stand together for he which praieth truely must be touched inwardlie with a liuely feeling of his owne miserie and of the want of that grace whereof he stands in need now this cannot be in the heart of at man that looketh to merite the king ome of heauen by his workes for he that n doo this maie iustlie conceiue some hat of his owne excellencie papists teach that it is great boldnes come immediatlie vnto god without e intercession of saints and therefore ey vse to breuiar amp missali refor vbique pray to marie that she would raie to christ to helpe them yet on the ontrarie when they haue so doone they ray to god immediatlie that he would re eiue the intercession of marie for them and thus they are become intercessors be eene marie and god yes when they ffer vp christ praying god to accept heir gifts and sacrifices the humble priest hat will not praie to god but by the editation of saints is then a mediator etweene christ iesus and god his father it holdeth that in the masse the priest ffereth vp christ to his father an vnbloudie acrifice this is a thing impossible for if christ in the masse be sacrificed for sin the e must die amp his bloud must be shed heb and in the scriptures these two sayings christ is dead christ is offered vp in sacri ice are all one so then the papist when he upposeth that there maie be an vnbloudie sacrifice in effect he saith thus much ther is a sacrifice which is no sacrifice in the canon of the masse the church of rome praieth on this wise we humblie beg thee most mercifull father by iesus christ thy son amp our lord y t thou wouldest accept these gifts and oblations amp these holy sacrifices which we thy church offe to thee ampc where first they offer vp christ to god the father in the name of christ amp so they make christ to be his owne mediator againe they desire god to blesse amp to accept his owne son for they offer vp christ if they say he needeth now the blessing of his father they make christ a weak and imperfect christ if hee neede not the blessing of his father their praier is needelesse also they desire god to accept not one gift or one sacrifice but in the plurall number these gifts and sacrifices whereas they hold that christs body is one only bodie and therfore but one sacrifice and thus they are at variance with themselues papists in word they say that they beleeue and put their trust in god yet wheras they looke to be saued by their workes they set the confidence of their hartes in truth vpon their owne doings they put such holines in matrimo ie that they make it one of their sacra ets which rhem test pag confer grace to the partakers f them yet they forbidde their cleargie to arrie pap syric us decret epistle sess c because to liue in marriage is to ue according to the flesh and the coun el of trent opposeth marriage amp chastitie it teacheth that soules kept in pur atorie maie bee redeemed by sacrifices nd suffrages against this is a canon of heir lawe taken out of saint hieromes can in present q we nowe that in this life wee maie helpe one nother either by praiers or by good ounsell but when wee shall come be ore the iudgement seate of christ nei her iob nor daniel nor noe maie intreate or anie but euerie man to beare his owne burthen and according to another canon going vnder the name of gelasius bishop of rome either there is no purgatorie or the soules which goe thither shall neuer returne and to conclude the most points of their religion are contrarie to their canons as by searching may appeare in these examples by this which hath beene saide it doth in part appeare that the religion of the church of rome is repugnant to it self and it could not so be if it were from the worde of god a man beeing indued with no more grace then that which he maie obteine by the religion of the church of rome is still in the state of damnation ovile helhound thou article my slaue and my vassall why then shakest thou off my yoke by nature i was thy vasal but christ hath redeemed me christ redeemeth no reprobates such as thou article i am no reprobate thou article a reprobate for thou halt be condemned lucifer to pronounce dam ation belongeth to god alone thou article no iudge it is sufficient for thee to bee an accuser though i cannot condemne thee yet i know god will condemne thee yes but god will not condemne me goe too let vs trie the matter is not god a lorde and a king ouer thee and maie he not therefore giue thee a lawe to keepe and punish thee with hell fire if thou breake it yes and hast thou kept the lawe o this thy lord and king no let vs proceede further is not the same lord also a most righteous iudge amp therfore a most sharpe reuenger of sinne yes truelie why then wilt thou flat thy selfe thou hypocrite god cannot winke a thy sins except he should be vniust wher fore there is no remedie thou article sure to b damned hell was prouided for thee amp now it gapeth to deuoure thee there is remedie inough to deliuer me from condemnation for god i not onelie as thou affirmest a lord and iudge but also a sauing and a most mercifull father but thou fire brande of hell fire and childe of perdition looke for no mercie at god hands because thou article a most grieuous sinner for originall sinne runneth whollie ouer thee as a lothsome botch or leprosie thy minde knoweth not the thinges that be of god in the lawe of god thou article starke blinde sauing that thou hast a fewe principles of it to make thee inexcusable the gospel is foolishnes and madnes vnto thee thou makest no better accompt of it then of thine owne dreame thy conscience is corrupt because it flattereth thee and excuseth thy sinne thy memorie keepeth and remembreth nothing but that which is against god word but thinges abhominable and wicked it keepeth long thy will hath no inclination to that which is good but onelie to sinne and wickednesse thy affections are set onelie on wickednes they are as mighty giants and princes in thee they haue thee at commandement remember that for verie anger thou ast beene sicke that the lust of thy flesh hath driuen thee to madnes forget not thy atheisme thy contempt of god worde thy inward pride thy envy hatred malice thy couetousnes and infinite other wicked desires which haue led thee captiue and made thee outragious in all kind of naughtines thy actuall sinnes committed partlie in secrete partlie in publike are most filthie and most infinite remember howe in such a place at such a time thou didst commit fornication in another place thou diddest steale ampc god saw this i warrant thee yes all thy sinnes are written in his booke wherefore thou cursed wretch all hope of mercie is cut off from thee but god mercie farre exceedeth all these my sinnes and i cannot bee so infinite in sinning as god is infinite in mercie and pardoning darest thou presume to thinke of god mercie why the least of thy sinnes deserueth damnation none of my sinnes can feare me or dismaie me christ hath borne the full wrath and vengeance of his father vpon the crosse euen for me that i might be deliuered from condemnation which was due vnto mee if god purpose were not to condemne thee perswade thy selfe hee would neuer laie so manie afflictions and crosses on thee as he doth what is this want of good name this weaknes and sicknesse of the bodie these terrours of thy minde this dulnesse and frowardnes of thy hart what are all these i saie and manie other euils but the beginnings and certaine flashings of the fire of hell nay rather my afflictions are liuelie testimonies of my saluation for god as a louing father partlie by them as with courges chastneth my disobedience and bringeth me into order partly conformeth me vnto my sauiour christ and so by little and little layeth open to mee mine owne sinnes that i may dislike my selfe and hate them and maketh mee to renounce the or de thy eldest son and stirreth me vp to call vpon him amp to praie earnestly with grones and sighes which i am not able to expresse with anie wordes as i feele them thy afflictions are heauie and omfortlesse therefore they can not be arguments of god fauour indeed their nature is to bring griefe and heauines to the soule but i haue had ioy in the middest of my afflictions amp strength sufficient to beare them and after them haue ben many waies bettered which befalleth to none of the wicked and for that cause it is a great perswasion to mee that shal not be damned with the wicked world but in spite of all thy power passe fro death to euerlasting life after these thy manifold afflictions thou must suffer death which is mo terrible and a verie entrance to hell death hath lost his sting b christes death and vnto me it shall be nothing els but a passage vnto euerlasting life admit thou shalt bee deliuere from hell by christ what will this auail thee cosidering that thou shalt neuer com to the kingdome of heauen for christe death only deliuereth thee from death eternal it can not aduance thee to euerlastin life i am nowe at this time a member of christs kingdome and after this lif shall raigne with him for euer in his euerlasting kingdome thou neuer didst fulfill the law therefore thou canst not come into the kingdome of heauen christ hath perfectlie fulfilled euerie part of the lawe for mee and by this his obedience imputed vnto mee i my selfe do keepe the lawe be it so for all this thou article farre inough from the kingdome of heauen into which no vncleane thing shall euer enter thou although that christ hath suffered death and fulfilled the lawe for thee yet thou article in part vncleane thy cursed nature and the seedes of sinne are yet remaining in thee christ in the virgin wombe was perfectly sanctified by the holie ghost and this perfect holines of his humane nature is imputed to me euen as iacob put on esaus garments to get his fathers blessing so i haue put on the righteousnes of christ as a long white robe couering my sinnes amp making me appeare perfectlie righteous euen before god iudgement seat indeed god hath made promise vnto mankinde in all these mercies and benefits in christ but the condition of this promise is faith which thou wantest and therfore canst not make anie accompt that christes sufferings christes fulfilling of the lawe christes perfect holinesse can doe thee anie good i haue true sauing faith thou sayest that thou hast true faith but i shall sift thee and disproue thee the gates of hell shall neuer preuayle against my faith doe what thou canst tell me then doest thou thinke that all the world shall be saued no what shall some be saued and some condemned so saith the worde of god thou then are peswaded that god is true euen in his mercifull promises and that he will saue some man as peter and paul amp dauid ampc and this is the onely be leefe by which thou wilt be saued naie this i beleeue and more too that i particularly am in the number of those man which shall be saued and this is the beleefe that saueth me it may bee thou article perswaded that god is able to saue thee but that god will saue thee that is that he hath determined to aduance this thy body and this thy soule into his kingdome amp that he is most willing to performe it in his good time heerein thou wauerest and doubtest nay sathan i in mine owne heart am fully perswaded that i shall be saued and that christ is specially my redeemer and o lord for christes sake helpe thou my doubting and vnbeliefe this thy full perswasion is onely a phantasie and a strong imagination of thine owne head it goeth not with thee as thou thinkest it is no imagination but trueth which i speake for me thinks i am as certaine of my saluation as though my name were registred in the scriptures as dauids and pauls are to be an elect vessell of god and this is the testimonie of the holy spirit of iesus christ assuring me inwardly of my adoption and making me with boldnesse and confidence in christ to pray vnto god the father still thou dreamest amp imaginest thou louest and likest thy self and therefore thou thinkest the best of thy selfe yes but god of his goodnesse hath brought foorth such tokens of faith in me that i cannot be deceiued i am displeased with my selfe for my manifold sinnes in which sometime i haue delighted and bathed my self rom i purpose neuer to commit them againe if god giue me strength as i trust he will i haue a verie great desire to be doing those things which god commandeth those that bee the children of god if i doe but heare of them i loue them with my hart and wish vnto them as to my selfe john my heart leapeth for gladnesse when i heare of the preaching of the word i long to see the comming of christ iesus that an end may be made of sinning and of displeasing god apocrypha i feele in my heart the fruites of the spirit ioy loue peace gentlenes meekenes patience temperance the workes of the flesh i abhorre them fornication adulterie vncleannesse wantonnesse idolatry strife envy anger drunkennesse bibbing and quaffing and all such like galathians all these they cannot proceede from thee sathan or from my fleshe but onelie from faith which is wrought in me by god holie spirite if this were so god would neuer suffer thee to sinne as thou doest i shall sinne as long as i liue in this worlde i am sure of it because i am taught to aske remission of my sinnes continually but the manner of my sinning now is otherwaies than it hath beene in times past i haue sinned heretofore with ful purpose and consent of will but now doubtles i doo not before i commit anie sinne i do not go to the practising of it with deliberation as the carnall man doth who taketh care to fulfill the lustes of the flesh but if i doo it it is flat beside my minde and purpose in the doing of anie sinne i woulde not doe it my heart is against it and i hate it and yet by the tyrannie of my flesh being ouercome i doe it afterwardc when it is committed i am grieued and displeased at my selfe and doe earnestlie with teares aske at god hands forgiuenesse of the same sinne indeede this is verye true in the children of god but thou article solde vnder sinne and with great pleasure doest commit sinne amp louest it with thy whole heart otherwise thou wouldest not fall to sinne againe after repentance and commit euen one and the same sinne so often as thou doest thou hypocrite this thy behauiour turneth all the fauour of god from thee nay it is the order of the prophets to call man to repentance which haue fallen from the feare of god and from the repentance which they professed and god in thus calling him putteth them in hope of obtaining mercie and the law had sacrifices offered euery day for the sinnes of all the people and for particular man both for their ignorances and their voluntarie sinnes which signifieth that god is readie to forgiue the sinnes of his children yes if they sinne daily abraham twise lied and swore that sara was not his wife ioseph swore twise by the life of pharao dauid comitted adulterie often because he tooke vnto him bathsheba vriahs wife amp also kept sixe wiues and ten concubines god will is that me forgiue till seuentie seuen times and therefore he will shew much more mercie and for my part so oft as i shall fall into the same sin so oft i shall haue christ my aduocate and intercessour to the father for me who will not damne me for the infirmitie which he findeth in me i will abstaine from externall iniquitie and i wil not make my members servant vnto sinne and so long i trust my imperfections shall haue no power to damne mee for christes perfection is reputed to be mine by faith which i haue in his bloud god is not displeased if my bodie be sicke and subiect to diseases no more is he displeased at the disease and sicknesse of the soule a naturall father will ot slay the bodie of his childe when he is sicke and abhorreth comfortable meates and my heauenly father will not condemne my soule although through the infirmitie of faith and the weakenesse of the spirit i commit sinne and often loath his heauen y word the food of my soule nay which s a strange thing i know it by experience hat god hath turned my filthie sinnes to my great profit and to the amendment of my life like as the good phisition of ranke oison is able to make a soueraigne medicine to preserue life well be it that now thou article in the state of grace yet thou shalt not continue so but shalt before death depart from christ i know i am a meber of christs misticall bodie i feele in my selfe the heauenlie power and vertue of my head christ iesus and for this cause i cannot perish but shall continue for euer and raigne in heauen after this life with him thy minde is full of ignorance and blindnes thy heart is full of obstinacie rebellion and frowardnes against god thou article whollie vnfit for anie good work wherfore thou hast no faith neither canst thou be iustified and accepted before god if i haue but one drop of the grace of god and if my faith bee no more than a litle graine of mustard seede it is sufficient for mee god requireth not perfect faith but true faith yes but thou hast no faith at all i haue had faith thou neuer hadst true faith fo in time past when according to thine own opinion thou didst beleeue then thou hadst nothing but a shadow of faith and a foolish imagination which all hypocrites haue i wil put my trust in god for euer amp his former mercies shewed mee heretofore strengthe me now in this my weaknes he created me when i was nothing he created me a man when he might haue made me an vglie toade he made me of comelie bodie and of good discretio wheras he might haue made me vglie amp deformed franticke amp mad i was borne in the daies of knowledg when i might haue beene borne in the time of ignorance and superstition i was borne of christian parents but god might haue giuen me either turks or iewes or some other savage people for my parents i might haue perished in my mothers wombe but he hath preserued me and prouided for me by his prouidence euen vnto this houre soone after my birth god might haue cast me into hell but contrariwise i was baptized and so receiued the seale of his blessed couenant i haue had by god goodnesse some sorrowe for my sinnes past and haue called on him in hope and confidence that he would heare me god might haue concealed his wor from mee but i haue heard the plentifu preaching of it i vnderstand it and hau receiued comfort by it lastly at this time god might pow his full wrath on me which he dooth no but mercifully maketh me to feele mi owne wants that i might be humbled a giue all glorie vnto him for his blessing wherefore there is no cause why i shou bee disquieted but i will trust still in t lord and depend on him as i haue done thou feelest no grace of the h lie ghoste in thee nor anie true tokens faith but thou hast a liuely sense of the r bellion of thy heart and of thy lewde a wretched conuersation therefore th canst not put anie confidence in christ death and sufferings yet i will hope against all hop and although according to mine ow sense and feeling i want faith yet i will b leeue in iesus christ and trust to be sau by him though the children of god haue beene in many perplexities yet neuer any of them haue bin in this case in which thou article at this present heerein thou prouest thy selfe to be a lying spirite for the prophet dauid aith of himselfe that he was foolish and as a beast before god and yet he euen then trusted in god and paule was so led cap iue of sinne that he was not able to do the good he would but did the euill which hee ated and so in great pensiuenes of heart desired to be deliuered from this world that ee might bee disburdened of his corrupt esh thou miserable wretch doest ou feele thy selfe gracelesse and wilt thou eare the face of a christian and by thy ypocrisie offend god as thou article so shew y selfe to the world auoide sathan christe hath anquished and ouercome thee for my ause that i might also triumph ouer thee am no hypocrite for whereas i haue had eeretofore some testimonie of my faith at his time i am lesse mooued though faith eme to be absent like as a man may seeme bee dead both in his owne sense and by the iudgement of the phisition and yet maie haue life in him so faith maie bee though alwaies it doe not appeare but thou article a man starke dead in sin god hath now quite forsaken thee hee hath left thee vnto me to be ruled hee hath giuen me power ouer thee to bring thee to damnation he will not haue thee to trust in him anie longer strengthen me good lord remember thy mercifull promises that thou wilt reuiue the humble amp giue life to them that are of a contrite heart these promises concerne not thee which hast no humble and contrite but a froward and a rebellious heart good lorde forget not thy former mercies giue an issue to these temptations of mine enemie satan and you my bretheren which know my estate praie for me that god woulde turne his fauourable countenance towards me for this i know that the ptaier of the righteous auaileth much if it be feruent everie christian containeth in himselfe two natures flat contrarie the one to the other the flesh and the spirite and that he may become a perfect man in christ iesus his earnest indeuour must bee to tame and subdue the flesh amp to strengthen and confirme the spirit answerable to these two natures are the two parts of god worde first the lawe because it is the ministerie of death it fitlie serueth for the taming and maistering of the rebellious flesh and the gospell containing the bountifull promises of god in christ is as oile to powre into our wounds and as the water of life to quench our thirstie soules amp it fitlie serueth for the strengthening of the spirite well then article thou secure article thou prone to euill feelest thou that thy rebellious flesh carrieth thee captiue vnto sinne looke nowe onelie vpon the lawe of god applie it to thy self examine thy thoughts thy words thy deedes by it pray vnto god that he would giue thee the spirit of feare that the law maie in some measure huble amp terrifie thee for as salomon saith blessed is the man that feareth alwaies but cursed is he that hardeneth his heart in the law these are most effectuall meditations to humble and bridle the flesh which follow first meditate on the greatnes of thy sinnes and of their infinite number and if it may be gather them into a catalogue set it before thee and looke vnto it that thou think no sinne to be a small sin no not the bare thoughts and motions of thy heart often with diligence consider the strange iudgements of god vpon man for their sinnes which thou shalt find partlie in the scriptures partlie by dailie experience doubtlesse thou must thinke that euerie iudgement of god is a sermon of repentance thinke oft on the fearefull curse of the law due vnto thee if thou shouldest sin neuer but once in al thy life and that neuer so litle remember that whensoeuer thou committest a sin god is present and his holie angels amp that he is an eie witnes that he taketh a note of thy sin amp registreth it in a booke thinke dailie of thy ende and know that god maie strike thee with sodain death euerie moment and that if then thou haue not repented before that time there is no hope of saluation thinke on the sodain comming of our sauiour christ to iudgement let it moue thee continually to watch and praie if these will not moue thee think on this that no creature in heauen or in earth was able to pacifie the wrath of god for thy sins but his owne son must come downe from heauen out of his fathers bosome and must beare the curse of the lawe euen the full wrath of his father for thee when by these meanes thou article feared and thy minde is disquieted in respect of god iudgement for thy sin haue recourse o the promises of mercie contained in the ld and new testament is thy conscience stung with sin and doth the law make the feele it with all speede runne to the brase serpent christ iesus look on him with the eie of faith and presently thou shalt be healed of thy sting or wound when thou doest meditate on the promises of the gospell diligentlie conside these benefites which thou enioiest by christ through adam thou article condemned to hell by christ thou article deliuere from it through adam thou hast transgre sed the whole law in christ thou hast fulfilled it through adam thou article before go a vile amp a lothsome sinner through chri thou doest appeare glorious in his eies b adam euerie litle crosse is the punishmen of thy sin and a token of god wrath by christ the greatest crosses are easie profitable and tokens of god mercie by adam thou diddest loose all thinges in christ a things are restored to thee again by adam thou article dead by christ thou article quickne and made aliue againe by adam thou article slaue of the diuel and the childe of wrat but by christ thou article the child of god adam thou article worse than a toade amp mo detestable before god but by christ tho article aboue the angels for thou article ioined vnto him and made bone of his bone misticallie through adam sinne and sathan haue ruled in thee and led thee captiue by christ the spirite of god dwelleth in thee plenteouslie by adam came death to thee amp it is an entrance to hel by christ though death remain yet it is onelie a passage vnto life lastlie in adam thou article poore and blinde and miserable in christ thou article rich and glorious thou article the king of heauen and earth fellow heire with him and shalt as sure be partaker of it as he is euen now adam when he must needs tast of the fruit which god had forbidde him he hath made vs all to rue it euen till this daie but here thou seest the fruits that grow not in the earthlie paradise but on the tree of life which is within the heauenlie hierusalem fear no danger be bold in christ to eate of the fruit as god hath commanded thee it wil quicken thee amp reuiue thee being dead thou cast not do satha a worse displeasure tha to feed on the godly fruit of this tree amp to smell on the sweete leaues which it beareth cotinuallie that giue such a refreshing sauour most man now a daies are secure amp cold in the professio of the gospel though they haue the plentiful preaching of it and the reason is because they feel not in theselues the vertue and mightie operation of god word to renue them amp they cannot feel it because they do not applie the word aright vnto their own soules plaisters except they be applied in order amp time amp be laied vpon the wound though they be neuer so good yet they canot heal amp so it is with the word of god amp the parts of it which except they be vsed in order amp time conuenient wil not humble and reuiue vs as their vertue is the common christian euerie where is faulty in this thing whereas hee loueth himselfe amp wisheth al good that maie be to himselfe hee doth vsuallie applie vnto his owne soule the gospell alone neuer regarding the law or searching out his sins by it tell him what ye will his song is this god is merciful god is merciful by this meanes it cometh to passe that he leadeth a secure life amp maketh no conscience of couetousnes of vsurie of deceit in his trade of lying of swearing of fornication wantonnes int mperacie in bibbing amp quaffing ampc but he plaieth the vnskilful chirurgio he vseth healing plaisters before his poisoned and cankred nature haue felt the power amp paine of a corasiue and it will neuer be wel with him vntill he take a new course on the contrarie part many good christians leaue to apply the comfort of the gospel to themselues and onlie haue regard to their owne sinnes and god infinite vengeance and euen when sathan accuseth them they will not sticke to giue eare to sathan and also accuse themselues and so they are brought into feareful terror and often draw neere to desperation there is a third sort called sectaries who addict themselues to the opinion of some man these commonlie neuer applie the law or the gospell to themselues but their whole meditation is chieflie in the opinios of him whom they follow as they that follow luther few of them follow his christia life they regard not that but about consubstantiation and vbiquity about images and such like trumperie they infinitelie trouble themselues and all europe too and in england there is a scismaticall and vndiscreet company that would seeme to crie out for discipline their whole talke is of it and yet they neither knowe it nor will be reformed by it and yet they are enemy to it as for the lawe of god and the promises of the gospell they little regarde they maintaine vile sins in refusing to heare the reading or the preaching of the worde and this is great contempt of god benefites amp vnthankefulnesse to him they are full of pride thinking themselues to be full when they are emptie to haue all knowledge when they are ignorant and had need to be catechized the poison of aspes is vnder their lippes they refuse not to speake euill of the blessed servant of god well doe they aboue al things seeke the kingdome of god then let them be sincere seekers of it which they shall doe if in seeking christs kingdome they seek the righteousnes therof vnto which they can neuer come but by the applying of the threatninges of the law and the comforts of the gospell to their owne consciences but whereas they seeke the one and not the other they giue all man to vnderstand with what spirit they speake good syr i knowe esay c the lord hath giuen you the tongue of the learned to be able to minister a word in time to him that is wearie therefore i praie you helpe me in my miserie ah my good brother what is the matter with you and what aile you i liued a long time the lorde he knoweth it after the manner of the worlde in all the lustes of my filthie flesh and then i was neuer troubled but it hath pleased god of his mercie to touch my heart and to send his own son that good shepheard iesus christ to fetch me home to his owne fold euen vppon his owne necke and since that time it is a woder to see how my poore heart hath beene troubled my corruption so boiles in me amp sathan will neuer let me alone your case is a blessed case for not to be troubled of sathan is to bee possessed of him that is to be held captiue vnder colloss c the power of darknes and to be a slaue amp vassall of sathan for luke c as long as the strong man keepes the hold all things are in peace contrariwise he that hath receiued anie sparkle of true faith shall see mat c the gates of hell that is the diuell and all his angels in their full strength to stand vp against him and to fight with an endlesse hatred for his finall confusion but this my trouble of minde hath made mee oftentimes feare lest god would reiect me and vtterlie depriue me of the kingdome of heauen but there is no cause why it should so doe for how should heauen bee your resting place if on earth you were not troubled how could god wipe awaie your teares from your eies in heauen if on earth you shead them not you woulde bee free from miseries you looke for heauen vpon earth but if you wil go to heauen the right waie is to saile by hell if you will sit at christs table in his kingdome you must be with him in his temptations you are as god corne you must therefore goe vnder the flaile the fanne the milstone and the ouen before you can bee god bread you are one of christes lambes looke therefore o be fleeced and to haue the bloudie knife t your throte all the daie long if you were marke sheepe bought to bee solde you hould be stalled and kept in a fatte pasture ut you are for god own occupying there ore you must pasture on the bare comon biding stormes tempestes sathans snat hes the worldes woundes contempt of onscience and frettes of the flesh but in his your miserie i will bee a simon vnto you o helpe you to carrie your crosse so bee it ou will reueale your minde vnto mee i will do it willingly my temp ations are either against my faith in christ r against repentance for my sinnes what is your temptation as ouching faith ah woe is mee i am much fraide least i haue no faith in christ my sauiour what causeth this feare diverse things what is one i am troubled with manye doubtings of my saluation and so it comes nto my minde to thinke that by my incredulitie i should quite cut off my selfe from the fauour of god but you must knowe this one thing that hee that neuer doubted of his saluation neuer beleeued amp that he which beleeueth in trueth feeleth manie doubtings amp wauerings euen as the ound man feeles manie grudgings of diseases which if he had not health he could not feele but you neuer knewe anie that hauing true faith doubted of their saluatio what will you then saie of the man that saide mark lorde i beleeue lorde helpe my vnbeleefe and of dauid who made his moane after this manner is his mercie cleane gone for euer doth his promise faile for euermore hath god forgotten to bee mercifull hath he shutt vp his tender mercie in displeasure yes hee goeth on further as a man in dispaire and i saide this is my death hereby it is manifest that a man indued with true faith maie haue not onelie assaults of doubting but of desperation this further appeareth in that he saith in another place psalm why article thou cast downe my soule why article thou disquieted within mee waite on god for i will yet giue thankes hee is my present helpe and my god and in verie truth you maie perswade your self that they are but thes vnreasonable man that say they haue long beleeued in christ without anie doubting of their saluation but dauid had more in him then i haue for me thinkes there is nothing in this wicked heart of mine but rebellion against god nothing but doubting of his mercie let me know but one thing of you these doubtinges which you feele do you like them or doe you take anie pleasure in them and doo you cherish them naie naie they appeare verie vilde in mine eyes and i doe abhorre them from my hearte and i woulde faine beleeue in man wee must consider his estate by nature and his estate by grace in the first he and his flesh are all one for they are as man and wife therefore one is necessarie to the doings of the other when the flesh striueth the man also striueth that is in subiection to the flesh yes when the fleshe perisheth the man likewise perisheth being in this estate with the fleshe a louing couple they are they liue and die together but in the estate of grace though a man haue the flesh in him yet hee and his flesh are diuorced a sunder this diuorcement is made when a man beginnes to dislike and to hate his flesh and the euill fruites of it this separation beeing made they are no more one but twaine and the one hath nothing to doo with the other in this case though the flesh beget sin and perish therefore yet the christian man shall not incu damnation for it to come more neere the matter you saie the fleshe begettes in you wauerings doubtinges and distrustinges what then it troubleth you but feare not remember your estate you are diuorced from the flesh and you are newe married vnto christ if these sinnes be laide at you doore accompt them not as your children but renounce them as bastards saie with paul i doubt indeede but i hate my doubtings and i am no cause of these but the the flesh in mee which shall perish when i shall be saued by christ this which you haue saide doeth in part content mee one thing more i praie you shewe mee concerning this point namelie how i maie be able to ouercome these doubtings for the suppressing of doubtings you are to vse three meditations the first that it is god commandement that you should beleeue in christ so saint john saith this is his commandement that wee beleue in the name of his son iesus christ thou shalt not steale is god commandement amp you are loth to breake it least you should displease god and pull his curse vpon your head this also is god commandement thou shalt beleeue in christ and therefore you must take heede of the breach of it east by doubting and wauering you bring he curse vpon you secondlie you must onsider that the promises of saluation in christ are generall or at the least indefinite xcluding no particular man as in one for ll maie appeare god so loued the worlde that e gaue his onely begotten son that whosoeuer eleeueth in him should not perish but haue euerla ing life nowe then so often as you shall oubt of god mercie whereas hee exclu eth you not and as when a prince giues pardon to all theeues euerie one can ap lie the same vnto himselfe though his ame bee not set downe in the pardon so e king of kings hath giuen a generall par on for free remission of sinnes to them that ill receiue it beleeue therefore that god true in his promise doubt not of your wne saluation chalenge the pardon to your selfe in deede your name is not set downe or written in the promise of grace yet let not anie illusion of sathan or the consideration of your owne vnworthinesse exclude you from this generall amp freemercie of god which hee also hath offered to you particularlie first in baptisme then after in the lord supper and therefore you are not to wauer in the applying of it to your selfe thirdlie you are to consider that by doubting and dispairing you offend god as much almost as by anie other sinne yo do not aboue hope beleeue vnder hope as you shoul doo secondlie you robb god of his glorie is that you make his infinite mercie to bee lesse then your sinnes thirdlie you make him a lier who hath made such a promisse vnto you and to these three meditations adde this practise when your hart is toiled with vnbeliefe and doubtings then in all hast drawe your selfe into some secrete place humble your selfe before god powre out your hart before him desire hi of his endles mercie to worke faith and t suppresse your vnbeliefe and you shall see that the lord ouer all is rich vnto all that call vpon his name the lord reward you for your kindnes i will hereafter doo my endeuour to practise this your counsell nowe i will make bold to shew another that makes me to feare least i haue no faith and it is because i doe not feele the assurance of the forgiuenesse of my sinnes faith standeth not in the feeling of god mercie but in the apprehending of it which apprehending maie bee when there is no feeling for faith is of inuisible things and when a man once commeth to enioy the thing beleeued then hee ceaseth to beleeue and this appeareth in iobs example when he saith lo though hee sleie me yet will i trust in him amp i will reprooue my waies in his sight he shalbe my saluation also for the hypocrite shal not come before him hee declareth his faith yet when he saith presentlie afterwarde wherefore hidest thou thy face and takest me for thine enimie hee declareth the want of that feeling which you speake off yet euerie true beleeuer feeles the assurance of faith otherwise paul would not haue said proue your selues whether you are in the faith or not indeed sometimes he doth but at some other times he doth not as namely at that same time when god first calleth him and in the time of temptation what a case am i in then i neuer felt this assurance onelie this i feele that i am a most rebellious wretch abounding euen with a whole sea of iniquities me thinkes i am more vglie in the sight of god then anie toade can be in my sight o then what shall i doo let mee heare some worde of comfort from thy mouth thou man of god tell me one thing plainly you say you feele no assurance of god mercie no in deede but do you desire with all your hart to feele it i doo indeed then doubt not you shal feele it o blessed be the lord if this be true why it is most true for the man that would haue anie grace of god tending to saluation if hee do truelie desire it hee shall haue it for so christ hath promised i will giue to him that is a thirst of the well of the water of life freely whereby i gather that if any wante the water of life hauing an appetite after it he shall haue inough of it and therefore feare you not onely vse the meanes which god hath appointed to attaine faith by as earnest prayer reuerent hearing of god worde and receiuing of the sacraments and then you shall see this thing verifyed in your selfe all this which you saie i finde in my selfe by the mercie of god my harte longeth after that grace of god which i want i know i doe hunger after the kingdome of heauen amp the righteousnes thereof and further though i want the feeling of god mercie yet i can pray for it from the verie roote of my heart bee carefull to giue honour to god for that you haue receiued already for these thing are the motions of the spirite of god dwelling in you and i am perswaded of this same thing that god which hath begon this good worke in you will perfect the same vnto the day of iesus christ the third thing that troubles me is this i haue long prayed for manie graces of god and yet i haue not receiued them whereby it comes oft to my minde that god loues me not that i am none of his child amp therefore that i haue no faith you are in no other case then dauid himselfe who made the same complaint i am wearie of crying my throate is dri mine eies faile whiles i waite for my god but dauid neuer praied so manie yeares without receiuing an answere as i haue done good zachary waited longer on the lord before he granted his request then euer you did its like hee praied for a child in his yonger yeres yet his praier was not heard before he was old and further you must note that the lord may heare the praiers of his servant and yet they bee altogether ignorant of it for the manner that god vseth in graunting their requests is not alwaies knowen as maie appeare in the example of our sauiour christ who in the daies of his flesh did offer vp praiers and supplications with strong crying and teares vnto him that was able to saue him from death and was also heard in that which he feared and yet wee knowe hee was not freed from that cursed death but must needes suffer it how then was he heard on this manner hee was strengthened to beare the death he had an angell to comfort him hee was afterward freed from the sorrowes of death and so it is with the rest of christes bodie as it was with the head some being in want pray for temporall blessings god keepes them in this want and yet hee heares their praiers in giuing them patience and strength to abide that want some being in wealth and aboundance praie for the continuing of it if it be the will of god the lorde dinges them into a perpetuall miserie and yet hee heares their praiers by giuing the blessednesse in the life to come you praie for the encrease of faith and repentance and such like graces you feele no increase after long praier yet the mercifull god hath no doubt heard your praier in that by delaying to performe your request he hath stirred vp in you the spirite of praier hee hath humbled you and made you feele your owne wants the better to depend on his mercie for the beginning and encreasing of euerie spirituall grace the fourth thing that troubles me is that i cannot feele faith purifie my heart and to worke by loue in bringing foorth liuelie fruits if this bee so continuallie that faith bring forth fruit it is verie dangerous and argueth a plaine want of faith yet for a certaine time it maie be so faith hath not onelie a spring time and a sommer season but also a winter when it beareth no fruit and there is manie a true christian like the brused reede that is ouerturned with euerie blast of wind and like the flaxe that hath fire in it which by reason of weakenes giue neither heate nor light but onelie a smoke thus much shall suffice for my first temptation wherein i take my selfe satisfied nowe if you please i will bee glad to rehearse the second i am content let vs heare it i am afraide least i haue not truelie repented and therefore that all my profession is onelie in hypocrisie what mooueth you to thinke so two causes especiallie the first is they which repent leaue off to sinne but i am miserable sinner i am laden with great burdens of sinne i doo continuallie displease god by my euill thoughts words and deeds you need not feare ro for where sinne aboundeth that is the knowledge and feeling of sinne there grace aboundeth much more i finde not this in my selfe but yet you finde thus much in your selfe those corruptions which you feele and those sinnes that you commit you hate the you are displeased with your selfe for them and you endeuour your selfe to leaue them yes that i doo with all my heart then howe miserable so euer you feele your selfe by reason of the mas e of your sinne yet you are not subiecte to condemnation but shall most certainely escape the same take this for a most certaine truth that the man that hates amp dislikes his sins both before and after hee hath done them shall neuer be damned for them i am euen hart sicke of my manifolde sinnes and infirmities amp these good words which you speak are as flagons of wine to refresh my wearie laden and weltting soule i haue begunne to flee sinne and to detest it long agoe i haue beene oft dipleased with mine infirmities and corruptions when i offende god my heart is greeued i desire to leaue sinne i flee the occasions of sinne i woulde faine fashion my life to god word and i praie vnto god that he woulde giue mee grace so to doo and yet which is the griefe by the strength of the flesh by the sleights and power of sathan i am often ouertaken and fall maruellouslie both by speach and by deed haue courage my good brother for whereas you haue an affection to doo the thinges that are acceptable vnto god it argueth plainely that you are a meber of christ according to that of paul they which are of the spirite fauour the things of the spirite well then if sathan euer obiect anie of your sinnes to your make aunswere thus that you haue forsaken the first husbande the fleshe and haue espoused your selfe to christ iesus who as your head and husbande hath taken vpon him to answere your debts and therefore if he vrge you for them referre him ouer vnto christ for there is no sute in lawe against the wife the husbande liuing yes i adde further if you bee ouer caried with sathans temptations and so fall into anie sinne you shall not answere for it but sathan it shall surely be rekoned on his score at the daie of iudgmet for he was the author of it if you fal by the frailtie of your flesh it shal perish therefore but you shal stil haue christ you aduocate indeede as you saie i haue in me an affection to please god but when i come to performe my obedience there i faile therefore marke this further as long as the children of god are in this life gen malac god regardeth more the affection to obeie then the obedience it selfe and they shall bee vnto mee saith the lorde of hostes in that daie that i shall doe this for a flocke and i wil spare them as a man spares his owne son that serueth him the father when he shall set his childe to doe anie busines though he doe it neuer so vntowardlie yet if he shew his good will to doe the best hee can his father will bee pleased and so it is with the lorde towarde his children you looke to haue some perfection in your selfe but in this life you shall receiue no rom more but the first fruits of the spirite which are but as a handfull of corne in respect of the whole corne fielde and as for the accomplishment of your redemption you must wait for it til after this life you would bee kissed with the kisses of christs mouth but here in this world you must bee content if you maie with marie magdalen kisse his feete for the perfection of a christian mans life standes in the feeling and confessing of his imperfections and as ambrose saith obedience due to god stands more affectu magis qua effectu in the affection then in the worke but why will god haue those whom he hath sanctified labour still vnder their infirmities the causes are diverse first hereby hee teacheth his seruaunts to see in what great neede they stand of the righteousnes of christ that they maie more carefullie seeke after it secondlie he subdueth the pride of mens hearts amp humbleth them by counteruailing the graces which they haue receiued with the like measure of infirmities thirdlie by this meanes the godlie are exercised in a continuall fight against sinne and are dailie occupied in purifieng themselues but to goe on forward in this matter there is another cause that makes me feare lest i haue no true repentance what is that i often times finde my selfe like a verie timberlog void of all grace amp goodnes frowarde and rebellious to anie good worke so that i feare lest christ haue quite forsaken me as it is in the strait seas the water ebbes and flowes so is it in the godlie in them as long as they liue in this world according to their own feeling there is an accesse and recesse of the spirit otherwhiles they bee troubled with deadnes and dulnes of heart as dauid was who praied to the lorde to quicken him according to his louing kindnes that he maie keepe the testimonies of his mouth and in another place he saith that god promises quickened him which coulde not be vnlesse he had beene troubled with great dulnes of heart againe sometimes the spirite of god quite withdraweth it self to their feeling as it was in dauid in the dai of my trouble saith hee i sought the lorde and my soule refused comfort i did thinke vpon god amp was troubled i praied and my spirite was full of anguish againe will the lord absent himselfe for euer and will he shew no more fauour hath god forgotten to be mercifull ampc the church in h canticles complaineth of this in my bedd sought him by night whom my soule loued i sought him but i found him not and againe my welbeloued put in his hand by the hole of the dore and heart was affectioned towardes him i rose pen to my welbeloued and my hands did myrrhe my fingers powre myrrhe vppon dles of the bar i opened to my welbeloued my welbeloued was gone and past mine heart was gone when hee did speake i sought him but i coulde not finde him i called but he answered me not contrariwise god at some other times sheds abroad his loue most aboundantlie in the hearts of the faithfull and christ lieth betweene tho breasts of his church as a posie of myrrhe giuing a strong smell but how can he be a christian that feels no grace nor goodnes in himselfe the child which as yet can vse no reason is for all that a reasonable creature and the man in a soune feeles no power of life and yet he is not dead the christian man hath manie quaumes come ouer his heart and he falles into manie a soune that none almost would loke for anie more of the life of christ in him yet for al that he may be a true christian this was the estate of peter when he denied our sauiour christ with cursing and banning his faith onelie fainted for a time it failed not i haue nowe opened vnto you the chiefe things that trouble me and your comfortable answers haue much refreshed my troubled minde the god of all mercie and consolation requite you accordinglie i haue spoken that which god out of his holie word hath opened vnto me if you finde anie helpe thereby giue god the praise therfore and carrie this with you for euer that by manie afflictions both in the bodie and the mind you must enter into the kingdome of heauen rawe flesh is noisome to the stomacke and is no good nourishment before it be sodden and vnmortified man and woman be no creatures fit for god and therefore they are to be soaked and boiled in afflictions that the fulsumnes amp rancknes of their corruption maie be delaied and they maie haue in them some rellish acceptable vnto god and to conclude for the auoiding of all these temptations vse this sweet praier following which that godlie saint maister bradford made oh lorde god and deere father what shall i saie that feele all thinges to bee in manner with me as in the wicked blind is my minde crooked is my will and peruerse concupiscence is in me as a spring of stinking puddle o howe faint is faith in mee how little is my loue to thee or thy people how great is my selfe loue how hard is my heart by reason whereof i am mooued to doubt of thy goodnes towards me whether thou article my mercifull father and whether i be thy childe or no indeed worthilie might i doubt if that the hauing of these were the cause and not the fruit rather of thy children the cause why thou article my father is thy mercifull goodnes grace and truth in christ iesus which cannot but remaine for euer in respect whereof thou hast borne mee this good will to bring mee into thy church by baptisme and to accept me into the number of thy children that i might be holie faithfull obedient and innocent and to call me diverse times by the ministerie of thy word into thy kingdome besides the innumerable other benefites alwaies hitherto powred vpon me all which thou hast done of this thy good will which thou of thine owne mercie barest to me in christ before the world was made the which thing as thou requirest straitlie that i shoulde beleeue without doubting so wouldest thou that i in all my deedes shoulde come vnto thee as to a father and make my mone without mistrust of being heard in thy good time as most shall make to my comfort lo therefore to thee deere father i come through thy son our lorde our mediatour and aduocate iesus christ who sitteth on thy right hand making intercession for mee i praie thee of thy great goodnes and mercie in christ to be mercifull to mee a sinner that i maie indeede feele thy sweet mercie as thy childe the time oh deere father i appoint not but i praie thee that i maie with hope still expect and looke for thy helpe i hope that as for a little while thou hast left me so thou wilt come and visite me amp that in thy great mercie wherof i haue great need by reaso of my great miserie thou article wont for a little season in thine anger to hide thy face from them whome thou louest but surelie o redeemer in eternall mercies thou wilt shewe thy compassions for when thou leauest vs oh lord thou doest not leaue vs very long neither doest thou leaue vs to our losse but to our lucre and aduantage euen that thy holie spirite with bigger portion of thy power and vertue maie lighten and cheere vs that the want of feeling of our sorrowe maie be recompenced plentifullie with the liuelie sent of hauing thee to our eternall ioie and therefore thou swearest that in thine euerlasting mercie thou wilt haue copassion on vs of which thing to the ende wee might be most assured thine oath is to be marked for thou saiest as i haue sworn that i will neuer bring anie more the water to drowne the worlde so haue i sworne that i will neuer more be angrie with thee nor reproue thee the mountaines shall remooue and the hilles shall fall downe but thy louing kindnes shal not mooue and the bond of thy peace shall not faile thee thus saiest thou the lorde our mercifull redeemer deere father therefore i praie thee remember euen for thine owne truth amp mercies sake the promise and euerlasting couenant which in thy good time i praie thee to write in my heart that i maie know thee to bee the onelie true god and iesus christ whome thou hast sent that i maie loue thee with all my heart for euer that i maie loue thy people for thy sake that i maie bee holie in thy sight through christ that i maie alwaies not onelie striue against sinne but also ouercome the same dailie more and more as thy children doe aboue all things desiring the sanctification of thy name the comming of thy kingdome the doing of thy will on earth as it is in heauen ampc through iesus christ our redeemer mediatour and aduocate amen

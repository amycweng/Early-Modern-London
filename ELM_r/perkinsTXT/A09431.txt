not conuenient to haue prognostications reasons concerning the byer immoderate care ioyned with distrust in god contempt of the prouidence of god in not reuerently regarding it concerninge the maker his vnability in prognosticating proued by the true end of the heauens by want of good experience by ignorance of perticular causes his manifold vntrueths his impieties and prophane speaches and actions not seeming a christian his trickes of deceit good reader i haue thought it couenient for some speciall causes in this short treatise to disclose a part of my mynde vnto thee concernyng the makyng of prognostications and if it might be to perswade thee not to spend thy money in buying any of them i haue long studied this article and was neuer quyet vntill i had seene all the secretes of the same but at y e length it pleased god to lay before me y e prophanenes of it nay i dare boldly say idolatry although it bee couered with fayre and golden shewes wherfore that which i will speake with griefe the same i would desire thee to marke with some attention my reason shall partely concerne thee partly y e prognosticatour himselfe first on thy behalfe i reason thus as a man doth see the blessinges of god vpon him so he must also labour with a carefull diligence to maintayne the state of this life but because the affection of man is caried headlong vnto a greedy couetousnesse this desire of ouermuch carpyng and caryng must bee bridled with two strong bittes first all our care must extende it selfe no further then the present day secondly in caryng we must not trust vnto our selues but fixe all our confidence in the mercy and prouidence of god who blesseth all and without whose goodnesse nothyng can come to passe doe what we will as touching the first we haue the direction of our sauiour christ who teacheth vs to pray on this wise giue vs this day our dayly bread whereby we are giuen to vnderstand that we are onely to seeke for the present time resting with this persuasio that he which hath blessed vs this day wil also to morow amp the next day shew his like goodnes vnto vs again in y e same place our sauiour christ speaketh on this wise care not the for the morow for the morow shall care for it selfe the day hath inough with his owne griefe by this we learne that god will prouide for euery day all things necessary though we do not encrease the present grief with caryng and casting in our heades how we shall liue in the time to come nowe tell me what is the cause that thou yearely doest buye a prognostication amp one of those whiche tell the straungest thynges is it because thou hast a delite to read the style of prognostications or because thou wouldest learne to prognosticate or because the pictures and characters whiche they make delite thy mynde it were follie to be persuaded of this seyng the very cause it selfe is manifest thy whole desire is to fil thy coffers amp to heape vp wealth thou article afrayde least thou shalt become poore therfore thou greedely buyest thee prognostications and cotinually searchest all the corners of them to see the state of the yeare to come eue thus in mynde reasoning with thy self i can neuer be quiet nor take my sleepe vntill such time as i haue knowne the state of the yeare ensuing that i may frame my busines accordingly this next yeare there will be much rayne it will rotte corne vpon the groud it wil be spoyled i will keepe my corne vntill the next yeare following i finde that corne wil be deare about halfe a yeare hence i wil not sell my corne now but keep it that i may haue plenty of money for it and sufficient beside to maintaine my house the sea and land is calme amp quiet this yeare the next yeare many shipwrackes amp troubles in many countreys will fall now i will fraught my ship that then i may be quiet these imaginations are liuely argumentes of thy diffidence amp despayre in the goodnesse amp louing kindnes of god if thou feare god loue god put thy whole trust in god y u article content to referre thy whole preseruation vnto the handes of god now these proling and raingeing conceites of the time to come argue that either thou neuer thinckest on god or at the least perswadest thy selfe that either he will not or cannot helpe thee and if thou in thy couetous mind pray vnto god thou cast not pray according to the institution of christ without hypocrisie giue vs our dayly bread this day uuherefore seyng the hauing of prognostications commeth of so wicked causes as is the greedy desire of prosperitie amp wealth and argueth some kinde of diffidence in god when thou readest these my wordes examine thine own hart if thou finde my sayings true as certainely thou shalt neuer hereafter desire to know the state of the yeare before hand except it be for the seasons of the yeare which i am perswaded y u mayst know in some part without any skill euen by thine owne experience concerning the contept of god prouidence thus much i say the prognosticatour if hee be asked whether he confesse the prouidence of god he will with all his hart confesse it but by his deedes he doth deny it for all the thinges whatsoeuer which can happen in a whole yeare he attributeth them to the starres amp so he publisheth his predictions alwayes mentionyng starres neuer or very slederly making any significatio of the power amp iustice mercy and euerlastyng wisedome of god and surely euen for the very paring of thy nailes for the cuttyng of thy hayre for the puttyng on of thy shoes for taking a iourney two or three miles fro thine house for obtayning at god handes thy request for makyng thy bargaine with thy neighbour for all thine actions bee they neuer so small these wise man if thou wilt aske their aduise will giue thee counsell from the stars now whe these their irreligious predictions shalbe had in thy bosome and red of thee dayly thou being a man vnlearned amp worldly giuen neuer hearyng any mention of the speciall prouidence amp hand of god in euery thyng but long discourses of the vertues of planets amp signes doest neuer thincke vpon the wonderfull and most infinite power of god working after a speciall maner in euery matter but article drawne straightwayes into an admiratio of the astrologer and a great feare of the constellations of heauen an experience of this i found in thee about two yeares ago a learned man yet in this case far deceiued wrote an astrologicall discourse of the coiunctio betwene iupiter amp saturne wherein he shewed of great alteratio in euery thing to fall at this thou wast sore agast thy mind was incobred with ettling thy goodes to set the in order against that day thy sog for halfe a yeare was nothing els but the coiunction the coiunction the day being come what staryng was there and gazing into heauen to see the meetyng of those planets now all this while where was god prouidence where was that trust and reioysing in him where was that praysing of his name for all thinges whatsoeuer should come to passe where was that meditation of his infinite amp vnsearcheable wisdome these thinges were neuer thought nor hard of and if they were hard of yet by reason of thine earthly affections they tooke no place in thine hart this thy dealyng is like vnto the follie of that man who hauyng a costly clocke in his bosome neuer extolleth or thinketh on the wit and inuention of the clockemaker but is continually in admiration of the spring or watch of the clocke by whose meanes all the wheeles haue their swifter or flower their backeward or forward motios and by which the whole clocke keepeth his course wherefore me thincketh that in a christian common wealth those onely bookes should bee published for thine vse which might beate into thine head and make thee euery houre and momet to thincke on the prouidence of god which being once settled in thy minde the consideration of the meanes which god vseth will follow it of selfe contrarywise to tell thee the meanes whiche god doeth vse to thunder out the aspectes and constellations of starres and seldome to mention of his prouidence maketh thee to feare and admire and loue the means quite forgetting the worke of god in the meanes this fault was very rife amongest the israelites who came yearely vnto astrologers and wise me wherefore that whiche is spoken by ieremie vnto them is also spoken vnto thee heere ye the word of the lord that he speaketh vnto you o house of israell thus saith the lord learne not the way of the heathen and bee not afrayd for the signes of heauen though the hethen be afraid of such in like sort god forbiddeth his people of england to giue credite or feare the costellations amp coniunctions of starres and planettes which haue no power of themselues but are gouerned by hym amp their secret motions and influences are not known to man amp therfore there can be no certain iudgement therof if thou wilt not heare amp folow this which i say see what will ensue thou seest that the greatest matters which these diuinours and prognosticaters foretell fall out flat otherwise then they say to to their perpetual shame truely i am perswaded that it is the iudgement of god vpon them although they cannot see it who maketh them when they thinke they are moste wise to be most fooles for so the lorde vsed the wise man and astrologers of chaldea as he speaketh by his prophet esay i am the lord that made al things that spred out the heauens alone amp stretch out the earth by my self i destroy the tokens of soothsaiers amp make the that coniecture fooles and turn their wise man backward amp make their knowledge foolishnes doest thou then o carelesse and miserable man thinke to escape the same or greater punishment being a cause of this fault for if none desired to know what is to come none would busie themselues in that vanity wherefore read the worde of god in the of deut when thou shalt come sayth the spirite of god into the land which the lorde thy god geueth thee thou shalt not learne to doe after the abhominations of those nation in the wordes following moses numbreth abhominations as to make his child go throgh the fire to vse witchcraft to regard tims this is thy falt to mark the flying of foules to be a sorcerer to be a charmer to counsell with spirites to be a soothsayer to aske counsell at the dead al these horrible abhominations being rehearsed marke what followeth for al that do such things are an abhomination vnto the lord amp because of their abhominations the lorde thy god doth cast the out before thee now seing most of these abhominations amp especially the is vsed of vs why should we not fear y e like iudgments vpon vs vnlesse we will repent and that with speede the reasons which concerne the prognosticatour and maye auayle to the perswading of thee not to buy any more of their vnprofitable bookes as these which follow first their vnhability in prognosticating secondly their manifest vntruthes thirdly their impieties fourthly their tricks of deceit what can they not foretel that which is to come can they not make coniectures of that whiche is like to ensue no surely and i will vse argumentes to confirme it vnto thee the true vse of the heauens consisteth in many pointes to declare the glory of god the heauens saith dauid declare the glori of god amp the firmament sheweth the worke of his hands it is an alphabet written in great letters in which is described the maiestie of god and that by these foure speciall poyntes first the maiestie of the worke it selfe the infinite multitude of starres by the wonderfull varietie of starres by the greatnesse of the starres secondly it maketh sinners and wicked menne inexcusable before the iudgement seate of god for the inuisible things of him saith paule that is his eternall power and godhead are seen by the creation of the world being considered in his workes to the intent that they should be without excuse thirdly they serue to the appointing of times as day night moneth yeare which are both measured and described by the course of the son and moone and other starres and so the feast of the israelites and the computation of the yeare in our church dependeth thereupon and without them there would be great confusion both in the common wealth and church fourthly they serue to be signes that is to foretell things to come and they are signes either of extraordinary thinges or thinges which be ordinary whe they are signes of extraordinary thinges then there is and appeareth in them some extraordinary work of god as appeareth in these examples which follow at the suffering of christ not onely the vayle of the temple rent and the dead rose foorth of their graues but also the sun was wholly eclipsed the moone being in y e full at whiche sight dyonisius areopagita a good astronomer spake these words either the frame of this world is destroied or the god of nature suffereth the prophet ezechiel being commaunded of god to prophecie the destruction of egypt he first putteth downe extraordinary signes and when i wil put thee out i wil couer the heauen and make the starres therof darke i will couer the sun with a cloud and the moone shall not giue her light all the lights of heauen wil i make darke for thee and bring darkenesse vpon the land saith the lord before the second coming of our sauiour christ there shall be signes in the sun and moone and in the starres lastly the extraordinary going backe of the sun signified the lengthning of the life of king ezekias secondly the starres or signes of generall things which happen ordinarily euery yeare in nature among vs as of approching and dedeclining of the spring sommer haruest vvinter ordinary weather in these quarters ebbing and flowing of the sea seasons of plowing sowing setting plant cutting felling reaping i say generall because the perticuler estate and affayres of menne can in no wise before signified by the stars i saye ordinary because the thinges which fall out seldome and are besides the common course of nature as plentie of all things famyne plague war euersions of kingdomes ampc doe not depende vppon the starres for the confirming of this i haue three reasons first in the of genesis god saith that he made the lights to be signes and yet the same god in the of esay sayth he will destroy the signes of them which diuine flatly forbidding vs to vse starres as meanes to iudge of any thing to come sauing onelie of those of which they are expresely made signes of god in the creation al which are put downe before secondly this is manifest by the order of the creation the third day god created vpon the earth hearbs amp trees amp the earth brought forth fruites and was fertile the fourth day god commaunded lights to be made in the firmament of heauen to seperate the dai and the night and to be for signes amp for seasons and dayes and monethes and then it was so and then god sawe it was good out of which i gather that it cannot be a signe causing famyne or plenty and fertilnes because fertilitie went before the creation of the host of heauen also of war and plagues and the particular estates of man they can bee no signes because man was not yet created and yet euen then they were signes some will saie they were no signes of those matters in the creation but nowe they may be and are no for the woorkes which god created he now preserueth neither increasing nor diminishing anie thinge in them philo iudeus in his booke de opificio mundi sayth hee was perswaded that god foreseeing the mindes of man geuen to search strange matters to come did in this order create the heauens to confute and dysprooue theyr imaginations thirdly the heauens and starres were made for the vse of manne and man is theii ende so that it is absurde to imagine they haue anye force in the affayres of man nowe then prognosticatours if they will foreshowe of straunge thinges to come they must vndoe the worke of their creator and giue vnto it newe vses otherwise they shal not bee able to prognosticate as they yearelie doe the prouidence of god is his decree by which he appointeth how euerie thing shall come to passe the continuall execution of this decree is ordinarily by meanes but often without meanes the meanes which god vseth are either generall or speciall generall are these by which hee gouerneth all the whole worlde and euerie perticuler thinge whiche concerneth this life vnto this kinde are referred spirituall creatures called angelles by whome the philosophers saie the heauens are gouerned and wee see that whole kingdomes prouinces and citties haue been kept and defended by them as also consumed and destroied againe the starres and heauenly body are vsed of god to gouerne and order things here below as it is in the psalme nothing is hid from the heate of the sun and by the prophet hosea the lord speaketh thus i will heare the heauens the heauens shall heare the earthe the earth shal heare the corne the corne shall heare israell but this instrument is onelie a generall instrument and hath his wor in ordinary matters of nature beside these meanes there be manie her by whiche god ruleth the world in the beginning hee sette ouer the whole worlde that hee foules beast and al things set the first born before their brother abell princesse and tirauntes ouer citties kingdomes common wealthes and therfore by reason of their dignitie calleth the god there be also gouernours of families ouer their families fathers ouer their children maisters ouer their servant yet god hath a more neare care in preseruing and gouerning his chosen as appeareth in the of esaye thus saith the lorde god that created thee o iacob and hee that fourmed thee o israell feare not for i haue redeemed thee i haue called thee by thy name thou article mine when thou passest through the water i wil be with thee amp through the floudes that they doe not ouerflowe thee when thou walkest thorough the verye fire thou shalt not be burnt neyther shall the flame kindle vpon thee for i am the lorde thy god the holy one of israell thy sauiour this is also manifest by that sympathie which is in the lord when hys children are afflicted as appeareth by the of zachary hee which toucheth you toucheth the apple of myne eye and in the of the actes saule saule why persecutest thou mee that is my electe uuherefore there bee also speciall meanes by whiche hee more carefullie gouerneth the elect as bee aungelles whome paule to the hebrewes calleth ministring spirites it is certayne they defend euery one of the elect perticularly hitherto may be referred the preaching of the word of god the ministring of the sacraments besides this god vseth the diuels and wicked man and tiraunts to exercise the faith of his elect and to confirm them in patience whereby they are called the seruauntes of the lord axes hammers sawes and swordes in the hand of god as pharao and nabuchadnezzar and senacherib moreouer as the meanes by which hee worketh vpon y e wicked are also many as angels good and evil ex frends and familiars iere amos wilde beast ierem heauen aboue deut diseases plague exod famyne hos fire hos fury hos hardnes of hart rom captiuitie ierem all these meanes god prouidence vseth first that he might shew his goodnesse towards vs secondly y t hee might be known to be the lord ouer al thirdly that we might be thankeful because he not onely himself gouerneth vs but also maketh his creatures to serue our turnes ma ie this must be noted as i said before that in all these secondarie causes beside their naturall worke which god hathe giuen them there is also the speciall worke of god his speciall h d showed god worketh not by second causes as magistrates gouerne their comon wealths by their inferiour officers for they so gouerne by them that they doe nothing or very little themselues and peraduenture neuer know what is done god gouerneth not the world so but in euery perticuler worke he hath his perticuler stroke that the thunder burneth moueth hurteth it is the generall prouidence of god but that it burneth or hurteth this or that manne on this or that part in this or that manner it is the special prouidence of y e same god the lord hath s wed his special prouidence in one excellent example if the hatchet sayth god fall forth of the hand of him whiche loppeth the tree and kill a man in the way i the lord haue killed him god also gouerneth the worlde immediately and hys prouydence woorketh without meanes and manie thinges he bringeth to passe agaynst all meanes which is manifest by that of matthew man liueth not by bread onely but by euerie worde which proceedeth out of the mouth of god for example without meanes the spirite of god did moue vpon the water and couer them in the creation immediatly the first garment which was made was of leather and god alone without means made it noe in the arke was preserued by god alone an whole yeare against the force of the water without meanes did he keepe the shoes and garmentes of the israelites whole fortie yeares he alone ius ifieth sanctifieth and conuerteth a sinner against the course of nature he made y e sea to diuide it self the sun to go backward the fire not to burne the children the lyons not to deuour daniel the causes of this are these that we may knowe when god worketh by causes he doth by no necessitie but freely that wee might know when god vseth meanes that then he is not idle but worketh al in all that if meanes want naye if meanes bee agaynst vs yet we should not dispayre of god prouidence now to come to oure prognosticatours and moone prophettes how shall they be able to knowe what will come to passe hereafter for first the heauens being onely one particuler instrument of god prouidence amongst manie they cannot certainly and truely saye this thing or that thinge proceedeth from the heauens secondly they cannot determine whether god in extraordinarie matters as plague famyne barrennesse distempered weather earthquakes war ampc doth worke immediatelye or wyth meanes if with meanes they cannot determine whether the heauens or aungelles or menne or anye other thinges bee the meanes of hys prouidence thirdly if they were able to knowe what the heauen woorketh naturallye yet they were neuer the better for god beside the power of the heauens hath in all thinges his particular workyng prouidence alteryng and framyng and bendyng a waxe his instruments to his good will truely by this consideration a christian man will be brought to leaue of to seeke what euent the workes of god shall haue before they come to passe if a man shall come into a ioyners shoppe can hee by knowing the vse of all his tooles tell what thinges he hath made in his shoppe no what is the cause of that he vseth not onely his tooles in his worke but thereunto adioyneth his owne hand by which he handleth and tourneth the toole to his own pleasure and so maketh diverse kinde of workes with the same instrumentes the same may bee sayd of our prognosticatours whiche i would to god they would somewhat consider if our prognosticators haue any means to foretell thinges to come they haue those meanes either without experiece or with experience if they haue them without experience then must thou accompt all which they do to be foolish dreames amp deceite for all kinde of humaine learning whiche is profitable amp hath vse in the life of man is taken fro often obseruations and experience if it be sayd that they haue their directions in prognosticating from experience and that of all tymes i will conuince them thus true experience of the causes of thinges is an often obseruing of the effectes of the same causes with this grounde that they can proceede from no other thyng the phisician sayth rhoubarbe doth purge choler well how knoweth he this hee hath often tryed this and that in olde man young man children and hath found that in the body of all man the cause of purgyng this humor could be ascribed to nothyng els uuherefore hee may peremptorily conclude rhoubarbe purgeth choler our prognosticatours in the heauens can haue no such experience for they can not obserue often the same position of starres in the heauen the order and cause of the fixed starres and planets whiche we finde in the heauens this day the next day wil be chaunged and neuer the like agayne they will say in deede although the same position of the whole heauen neuer happen yet the same coniunctions of notable starres the same visinges and settynges and the same constellations of the chiefest stars are marked often i say agayn that when these eclipses and great coniunctions happen the rest of the starres beyng otherwise affected then they were before amp hauyng new positions may either encrease and diminish their effectes or els hinder them and quite take them away as we see when the sun casting his beames into a chamber the light of candels and torches and fires doe make it shine dimme yet these beyng absent it will shine bright agayne they are not able to saye that constellations whiche they haue marked are causes of those effectes whiche followe as war diseases distepered wether earthquakes famine ampc for in those thinges which happe together the one is not the cause of the other when nero played vpon his harpe rome was on fire yet neroes playing on the harpe was no cause of the burning of rome also these effects may haue others causes in the heauen then those which they marke and they may come immediately fro god they may come onely from the will of man uuherfore seyng that they cannot assure themselues that those eclipses amp coniunctions are the workes of such effectes vpon earth amp they cannot haue often obseruations of the course of heauen their rules of predictions are feyned and supposed amp not built vpon true experience let a man whiche knoweth not one hearbe take all kindes of hearbes and put them into a great vessell yet so that there be more of some hearbes and lesse of other some let him beate them all together amp make a compound vertue of all their vertues can he now tell the nature and operation of euery particular hearbe can he deuide and seuer by any helpe the vertue of one hearbe fro another no in deede the same thing may be sayd of the starres of heauen all their lightes and all their influences as they terme it are in the lower body more plainly euery earthly body hath in it all the secret powers amp workyng of euery particular starre so that they make as it were a compounde operation rising of all or of the most of their vertues ioyned together for the astrologers hold that although the light may be hindred by the thickenes of the body yet the heauenly influence pearceth through all therefore they are not able to seuer and learne the nature of these starres except they ca stoppe the influence of what starres they list and bring them into what copasse they will yet thus much i will graunt them that they may haue a litle knowledge of the vertue of the sun and moone and some other starres as we see those hearbes in the former coposition whose vertues be the chiefest though not fully yet somewhat doe represent their nature and shew themselues aboue the rest but what is this to the purpose if i confesse the operations of the sun amp moone if i shall graunt that saturne is in nature cold amp dry iupiter warme amp moyste mars hot amp dry venus cold and moiste mercurie in nature mixt the notable fixed starres in the zodiacke to bee of the nature of planets and to haue manifest operations as the rising of the gg to make heate amp tempestuous seas the rising of arcturus to make rayne and showers pleiades to be of the nature of mars amp the moone ampc what will all this suffice to make a prognostication for seyng all starres haue their owne powers amp peraduenture also the least starres whiche we make no accompt of haue great effectes amongest vs as one grayne of muske in the apothecaries shoppe maketh a greater smel then all other powders bee they neuer so many nothyng will the knowledge of the operation of some starres preuaile the rest beyng not knowne and neuer regarded they will say they haue some experience but yet vnperfite i haue showed how they haue no true experience at all and their vnperfite experience maketh them perfite lyers a man whiche will iudge rightly of any matter by the causes must not onely consider the common causes but hee must also with them conferre the particular causes of all thinges which happen amonges vs so he shall iudge a right in heauen the starres be common causes of all thinges amongest vs because they shew their vertue on euery matter one way or other the same things haue their peculiar efficientes and matters and formes by whiche amp not by the heauens they are made that whatsoeuer they are these proper causes because their natures be vnknowen vnto vs i cannot see how the prognosticatour is able to foretell any thyng to come in good and conuenient maner laying aside all deceiuyng and forgeing of vntruthes to make this more playne i wil vse this similitude suppose an henne to sit vppon many egges some of her owne some of diverse other foules she imparteth her heate equally vnto them at the length she hatcheth and some of her chickens are cockes some hennes some crowes some patriches some doues some black some white some like and liue some dye some are killed of the kite some are rosted no man i thincke will professe so much skill as to say that he by the considering of the henne and her heate which is a common cause of the chickens and all that befalleth them is able to tell why of this egge came a partriche of that a crowe why this egge had no chicken why that had a dead chicken ampc except hee doe therewith all adioyne the consideration of the particular effectts the heauen is as it were an henne fostring vnder her winges all earthly thinges imparting his vertue and heate vnto all can our prognosticatour by the erectyng of figures by consideryng the disposition of euery planet in their houses and the significations of euery thyng iudge why this man is wealthy that man a begger why this noble man dyeth this yeare none the next yeare why it is nought to trauell this way good to trauaile that waye why these diseases abounde and not other why corne shalbe deare this quarter not the next why this weeke is fayre and temperate that weeke that moneth vnseasonable and tempestuous truely it is a thing flatte impossible they must hereunto adioyne the particular nature of the countrey the particular causes both in mens myndes and body as education place honestie byrth bloud sicknesse health strength weaknesse meate drincke libertie of mynde learnyng ampc and all other speciall circumstaunces whiche they neuer doe as we may see in their prognostications and if they woulde doe it yet they could not wherefore i muste needes saye this that their follie is greate in publishyng their prognostications and thou also greatly to bee blamed whiche by thy greedie desire giuest them great occasion to be so vnprofitably occupied to shew more briefly amp plainly of their vnabilitie in prognosticating although i graut the stars haue great force yet i say they cannot iudge of thinges to come and there be impedimentes the first impedimet is imbecillicie of wit for as mans eye from the earth beholding the heauens amp the starres perceiueth them not in their iust quatitie but as very small lightes for in deede the sun is an hundred amp threescore amp sixe times bigger the the earth saturne times iupiter mars one and an halfe the moone is the part of the earth the biggest sixed stars containe y e earth times the stars of the secod magnitude the third times the fourth magnitude times y e fift magnitude times the sixt magnitude times so the weaknes of mans vnderstanding is not able to conceiue and learne the thinges whiche the heauens do bring to passe on earth the impediment y e infinite nuber of stars which no doubt all haue great power although we do not finde it for the prognosticator onely marketh starres amp of these he taketh onely heede vnto a very fewe which is as though a man should iudge the power of an army by the powers of one or two souldiours and captaines not by the power of the whole company the impedim t is the infinite varieties of the vertues of stars amp the parts of heaue which astrologers graut to be yet they do not know the as touching y e nature of the fixed stars they know nothing but by the colour which is red leady white pale ampc resembling some planet and because they know not y e vertue of all stars amp euery part of heaue they are not able to iudge any thing but to their owne shame no more then the phisitian is able to know the nature of the copounde medicine without the knowing of euery simple the impedimet the manifold and dayly chaunge of the motions positios and configurations of the stars for if a man could tel both the number and nature of starres yet the varietie of positions breedeth trouble amp hindreth right iudgement because by this meanes the powers of stars are increased diminished amp chauged and these rules which serued for auncient tymes to foretell things wil not serue vs because all the fixed stars haue chaunged their places and the rest are dayly chaunged the impedimet the infinite varietie of inferior things which do hinder peruert chauge receiue or not receiue y e vertue amp predictions of stars as y e nature of the soile the dispositio naturall of ayre orders amp costitutions of the comon wealth occasions education institution kindes of meate and drinke ampc the impediment the will of man which freely in comon matters chuseth this amp refuseth that there are many thinges which are caused without any worke of starres onely by the will of man amp study as we may see in socrates demosthenes and other ampc thus much shall suffice to shew that they cannot prognosticate of things ensuyng now follow their manifold vntruthes and most false rules in disclosing them i will keepe the same order they vse in their almanackes in the first or second leafe of their books thou shalt finde a picture of mas body with the signes rounde about it they call it the anatomie of mans body shewing how the signes haue gouernemet of the same for the moone or any other significatour of any thing being in the signe they say that it is daugerous to boxe to seare that part or to let bloud in it whiche is subiect to the dominion of that signe all these are nothyng but vayne fables as i will manifestly proue whereas they call it an anatomy me thincketh it is a butcherly anatomy nay that of the butchers is far better for they ioyne head amp appurtenauce together these man being sparing giue aries the head leo and cancer the hart amp longes as for the liuer i know not which signe hath it peradueture in old time man had no liuers at the anatomye of a carrian crowes deale frendly for euery one hath somewhat but in the diuision of mans body signes play foule playe for capricorne hath got nothyng but a paire of knees it is like that the signes scramblyng for their portions capricorne beyng slowe got nothyng hereupon compassion being had there was a gathering made and sagittarius gaue the lower part of the thighe aquarius the higher part of the legge whiche both together make the knee but to deliuer thee out of all doubt marke these reasons whiche follow the signes cannot haue any such dominion ouer mans body i make it manifest thus there is no corporall heauen in deede aboue the firmament yet because the firmament or sphere hath many motions to giue reasons of those motions the astronomers haue feyned two heauens aboue the firmament the christaline heauen and the first moueable or sphere which they deuide into twelue partes whiche partes they call signes now i praye you tell me is it possible to conceiue that an imagined part of any imagined heauen voyde of all starres shall either haue in it selfe or giue vnto other starres power to gouerne the parts of mans body more reasonable was that man who beyng asked what was the cause of the sandes in sandwiche hauen he aunswered the buildyng vppe of tenterton steeple secondly the gouernement of the signes in the body is not taken from experience in nature but feyned long ago by some drowsie pate and now because it hath a cloake of antiquitie it is allowed more naturall was this kinde of waye that hote signes should gouerne hote partes cold signes cold partes earthy signes earthy partes so aries should gouerne the hart and the vitall bloud not the head amp the rest of the signes those partes whiche are of their nature and disposition thirdly great experience of many man dayly confuteth this rule for many learned phisitians amp expert chirurgians haue by infinite exaples found that if a man be let bloud in the signe or lanched or boxed or seared no harme ensueth nay they haue giuen testimony that the patients haue found euen then great comfort wherefore let not these thynges trouble thy mynde any more but let them be nombred euen amongest vaine and vnprofitable fables next after followeth elections of dayes and houres necessary for all matters as followeth speciall dayes to prepare humors let bloud purge with vomite electuaries potions pilles cut hayre comforte the vertue bathe attractiue digestiue retentiue expulsiue put children to schoole trauell marrye hunte hauke fishe plante geld cattell laye foundations here i pray thee marke their naughtie dealinges how they abuse thy ignoraunce to make themselues skilfull and to doe more then they can doe for if the iudgementes of the best astrologers may be taken certainly most of these elections cannot be prescribed to thee vnlesse they knowe beforehand the figure of thy natiuitie for all election which concerne thy person must be moderated to speake as plainly as their toyes will suffer mee by the direction of the roote of thy natiuitie and by the monthly and diurnall progressions of thy present reuolution if anie of these pretende some euill the perticuler election may bee a meanes to increase and to bring it to passe for example suppose thou being a man toward marriage in the almanacke thou findest a good daye noted by the prognosticatour to marry in thou takest thy opportunitie after a while thou article wearie of thy life the first daye of thy marryage was the last daye of thy ioye uuhat is the cause of this all the planettes which were signifiers of thy marriage in thy natiuitie were then euilly affected and peraduenture also at the first thou wast borne they receaued some disgrace so then thou maiest laye all blame partly vpon thy selfe for beleeuing and partlie vpon the prognosticator who deceiued thee but to come vnto particulers the elections of daies to purge the bodie with anie kinde of purgation and to comfort the same are most ridiculous why do they not also prescribe houres of eating meat why do they not appoint the kinds of meats and drink which wee must eate amp vse daily if thou see that god doth dayly blesse the enterprise of those phisitians which neuer regarde those elections in ministring to their patients neuer esteeme of them let them goe as lyes to the diuell from whence they came concerning the electios of days to sowe to sett to plant to lop they are also foolish the generall obseruation of the season of the yeare in whiche these things are to be done is sufficient and s augustine in his book de ciuitate dei laugheth at the folly of them whiche choose perticuler daies to do their husbandrie as thogh some certain positios of starres had some speciall influence to the thinges which are sowne then his reason is because manie grains of corn beeing cast into the grounde together springing vp together and riping al at one time yet some of them are blasted some are eaten of birds some are trode down vnder foot some stand and are neuer touched the rest of the elections and especially that of laying foundations is most absurde they saye that if an house a citie a town haue his foundation when the starres be well affected the inhabitauntes shall haue prosperous and quiet liuing if when the starres be euill disposed then trouble amp disquietnes they haue no experience of this but y t onely which is most false for they knowe not the foundations of cities and towns neither the positions of the stars when they were built let rome and venice be examples because these are most alledged of astrologers the time in whiche they were built is vncertaine and the planets are falsly sette in the figure of the foundation of rome because mercurye is contrarie to the sun a thinge flatte impossible agayne the folly of this is thus manifest that an house or citie or common wealth may remayne the people being gone as it is in the time of plague and banishment and conquestes of princes and the inhabitantes also may be safe and remain the building quite ransumed and beaten downe as we may see in carthagena the people and common wealth remai ned the cittie quite defaced that al elections are unlawful saint augustine writing vnto ianuarius prooueth it forth of the to the galathians by these wordes ye obserue months and times and yeares therfore saith he let vs not obserue dayes amp yeres and monethes and times least wee heare this of the apostles i am afraid least i haue taken labour in vayne with you for he rebuketh them which say i wil not goe because the moone is thus or thus mooued or i will take my iourney that i may haue good successe because there is such a position of starres i will not doe my businesse this moneth because suche a starre gouerneth this moneth or i will doe my businesse this moneth because such a starre ruleth how then shall a man doe not to breake the worde of god article thou a man that desirest to leade a christian life then take the example of paule as a patterne to gouerne all the actions of thy life without ceassing saith he i make mention of you in my praiers beseeching that by some meanes one time or other i might haue prosperous iourney by the will of god to come vnto you so thou if thou hast anye businesse in hand any iourney to take any thing to buy or sell or anie other matter neuer regard the constellations of heauen committe thy selfe to the onely prouidence of god in whome thou hast thy life and motion and beyng who directeth all thy steppes pray vnto him priuately with thy selfe to blesse thee and all thy actions that they may tende to his glory thy welfare thou shalt finde that all thy enterprise wil haue better successe then if the whole hoast of heauen and all the prognosticatours of england had promised neuer so much prosperitie now let vs shew their absurd folly in prognosticating of the state of the yeare of which their predictions are either generall for the whole yeare or speciall for euery day in their general predictions are considered either the grounds of them or the matters which they foretell their groudes are especially two the figure of the reuolution of the yeare erected when the sun entreth into the first minute of aries the figure celestiall for the time of the eclipse of the sun and moone for vp n these twaine say they dependeth the whole state of the yeare in their celestiall figures they consider the erecting of them and the finding of the lord of the figure the erecting of the figure containeth very many absurdities they follow that way which regiomontanus did inuent neuer as yet prooued by anie experience and flatly differing from those waies whiche of ancient astrologers wer vsed and were inuented by gazulus and campanus nay oftentimes it maketh the planet or fixed starre to signifie a flat contrary thing to that which these two other do the casting of the heauens into twelue partes signifieng twelue didistinct kind of matters is ridiculous because it being imagined and voyde of starres can haue no force yet some will say other starres beeing in those places may haue and signifie suche or such effectes i answere that if starres of diverse natures comming to such an house always signifieng some one kind of thing then the house must of necessitie giue some force vnto the planet and so it shall haue not onely an augmenting but also an effectually working power which astrologers deny and no reason can proue they make the twelfth and eleuenth houses being higher aboue the horizon then the first to bee of lesse force then it and the fourth house to bee of greater power then any aboue the horizon not cardinall and the ende of the ninthe to be more in power then the begynning of the eleuenth house al which are against reason because a planet the more perpendicular his beames are the more is hys force they aunswere althoughe the force of the light be greater yet the secret influence is lesse and the first house hath more forcible influence the the twelfth or eleuenth if the influence be secret how can they knowe it againe they can by no good experience showe that those houses haue more influence then the rest this influence maketh against them i say they cannot prognosticate because thei know not one starres vertue for whereas they saye that the sun and moone and planets haue most force i aunswere that it is by reason of their light not their influence which is small and there is farre greater in the smallest fixed starres so that the fixed starres althoughe they haue no light or very small light perceiued yet they haue most influece and so these man must needes dreame because they iudge by wrong causes well their figure beeing framed and distinguished with faire characters then goe they on to find the lord of the figure that is that planet which hath most dignities in the figure these toyes be so foolish that a reasonable man woulde not vouchsafe to refute them yet a worde or twaine if the houses of the planettes shall be battered and puld downe all the rest of their worship and dignitie will lye in the dust aries and scorpius are appointed the houses of mars taurus and libra the houses of venus gemini and virgo the houses of mercury cancer the house of the moone leo the house of the sun sagittarius and pisces the houses of iupiter aquarius and capricornus the houses of saturne uuhat reason doe they giue of this leo and cancer say they are the houses of the sun and moone because they resemble the nature of these planets and because they come most neare our heads such reason they giue of the rest what feeble groundes are these as in the north parte of the worlde cancer and leo resemble the nature of the sun so in the south part in the contrarie climats capricornus and aquarius doe resemble their natures also in euery countrey some diverse signes be either verticall or els come neare the topp of the countrey and so all signes shall be the houses of the sun and moone now then the sun being displaced i cannot finde how the rest of the planets can keep their hold to go further the exaltations of planets in like maner are verie dreames they suppose exaltations be those degrees in whiche the planets were in the beginning of the world but why shuld those places giue more force then any other and if they could giue more force yet they haue falsly assigned them for the sun was not in aries when it was created of god but was placed in libra whiche i proue by this reason god created man and beast in perfect age giuing vnto them all kindes of fruites beeing then ripe so that in the beginning was the time of the yeare whiche wee call haruest now because god neuer afterward chaunged the seasons and wee finde that in the time of ripenesse the sun is alwaies in libra wee must needes also saie that hys place in the creation was in libra in the of exodus god commandeth that the feast of tabernacles should bee celebrated in the ende of the yeare when the isralites had gathered their fruites out of the fieldes wherefore it must needes be that haruest was in the beginning of the yeare the begynning and ending beeing both togither and so by compting backwardes we shal find that the sun was in libra in the beginning of the worlde to this agreeth iosephus de antiquit lib cap rabbi eleazer vpon genes and rabbi abraham abem esra vppon the of daniel the rest of the dignities of the planets consist of principles more weake then water first what is more vnreasonable to a reasonable man then this that swift motion shoulde giue vnto a planet two dignities and slow motion two debilities it seemeth to be plaine contrary for a swift course hindereth the force of the planet a slowe course helpeth the same and the stations of anie planett make an effectuall and sensible operation a cole of fire in a mans hand if it be shaken about very much it heateth verie little if it be shaken more slowly it heateth more but if it lie still it burneth violently beside this also experience confirmeth my assertion in the yeare of our lorde the sun enteryng into pisces was almost in trine aspect with saturne stationarie a little while after there was a great frost and snowe continuing many dayes and when saturne began agayne to be direct the weather was indifferent warme in the yeare in aprill iupiter almost in secunda statione beholding saturne in statione prima caused a great heate considering the time of the yere in the yeare saturne as i sayde before beeing stationarie made suche a colde that spoyled the grapes and made wine deare uppon these examples and manie other i may conclude that the worke and influence of of planettes is moste felte when they are stationarie because their vertue is fixed as it were in one place by reason of the slowe motion combustion is in like sorte a feyned thing uuhat reason can astrologers geue why it should geue vnto a starre fiue debilities they talke howe that experience teacheth them that planettes beeing vnder the beames of the sun doe loose a great nay some say all their force it is a manifest vntruthe for mercurie beeing of the nature of that planett with which hee is conioyned if he goe from coniunction with saturne vnto the sun hee getteth no debilities thereby but rather losing the feeble and vnfortunate nature of saturne receiueth a more strong and fortunate nature of the sun if any manne say against me that mercurie combust hathe no force he deceiueth himselfe for if he be not hindered hee naturallye will cause windes beeing combuste he not onely engendreth windes but causeth tempestuous windes and foule weather in aries taurus cancer hee maketh tempestes in virgo and scorpius raging seas in sagittarius capricornus aquarius and pisces rayne and snow againe when many dayes together there hath bene faire weather the sun if it come to be in coniunction or any other aspect with saturne maketh very foule weather and therefore the aspectes of the sun and iupiter are called apertiones portarum pro pluuia this could not com to passe if saturne had his force diminished by the beams of the sun a planet also being in cazimi that is being within minutes of the suns middle haith therby dignities which cannot well be if that cobustion giue debilities for the planet is in the middle of his combustion and the sun casteth his beames and force verie vehemently vpon it these suns shew how absurde a dreame combustion is yet if it were a good amp sound principle of astrologie and gaue vnto euery planet debilities yet it could not be proued that libertie from combustion shuld giue fiue dignities being onely a meere absence and priuation of the other magnes at the presence of the adamant is hindred from drawing iron yet if the adamant be away the attractiue vertue of the magnes is not increased here i might with ease confute y e triplicities of planets directions aspects applications preuentions refrenations with many such like but my intent at this time is onely to shew thee some vntruthes of oure prognosticatours thus muche of the groundes of their predictions now followe the matters of which they prognosticate and they are very manie nay there is no matter almost of which they will not giue their verdite but how they do this i will briefly make it manifest vnto thee that their lyes amp their vnchristian dealing may bee more loathed of thee they foretell of comets earthquakes famynes and plagues ampc but they do it as the blind man which casteth hys staffe hee knoweth not where no man as yet euer knewe the true causes of these as for cometes and blazing starres they do not rise of the influence of any starres neither are they anye earthly thinges but are in heauen moste commonly far aboue the moon as by geometrical amp astronomical demonstrations may be be proued how this cometh to passe the lord only knoweth and surely they do thee great iniurie that when as no doubt god doth lighten them and send the rest extraordinarily as threatnyng tokens of his sore displeasure yet they will rocke thee a sleepe in the cradle of securitie by telling that such tokens came from the ordinary course of the heauens they foretell all thinges whiche happen in ciuill affaires amongst man as are these which follow as loue and hatred of kinsfolke mariages encrease of farmes and liuings iniuries and quarells raysing of rentes exactyng of subsidies by officers false rumors imprisonmentes hard intreating of ecclesiasticall persons buying selling vnderminyng the studying of sciences frendes fall out for trifles solemne progresses fauour of noble man men shall fall body and goodes into the princes handes marchandise vnprofitable ampc these and such like proceede onely from the will of man the constellations of starres are neither signes nor causes of them some will say non imponere necessitatem sed inclinare stellas that is that starres doe not constraine but onely incline the myndes of man a most wicked saying although most commonly spoken of and defended for y e inclinyng of the wil of man is onely the work of god as the holy scriptures doe teache vs the hart of man sayth salomon purposeth his wayes but the lorde directeth hys steps o lord sayth ieremy the prophet that the waye of man is not in himself neither is it in man to walke and direct his steppes hee speaketh this because that nebuchadnezzar purposed to haue made war agaynst the moabites and ammonites but hearyng of zedekias rebellion hee turned his power to goe agaynste ierusalem therefore the prophet sayth that whereas hee had otherwise purposed yet this was the lordes inclination and direction agayne in the prouerbes we read this that the hart of the kyng is in the handes of the lord as the river of water he directeth it whether he will it will be sayd that although god properly and immediately inclineth the will of man yet also some small inclination must be giuen vnto the starres and that immediately for say some constellations worke vpo the elementes by the foure first qualities elementes worke vpon and alter the compound body and humors compounde body by their qualities change the senses the senses beyng altered the vnderstandyng is altered the vnderstanding lastly altereth and inclineth the wil of man therefore constellations incline the will this reason is not much vnlike that whiche the dronken man maketh seruing as well for the defence of his vice as the former for approuing of truth in diuination the deceites and vntruthes whiche be in their reasons are very many the starres worke vpon mens body yet so y t the nature of the country and soyle the meates and drinkes haue most commonly greater force why are the body of gentlemen of england and poore labouring me of diverse dispositions are they not both in one countrey do not the starres shew their force in them alike yes truely but the kinde of life and diet preuaileth in the same region why are they which dwel vpon hills of other temperatures then they which dwell vpon playne amp champion grounde why doe not the same influences of starres make them of like natures is it not because the nature of the soyle preuayleth so then when as there be many causes effectuall and differing in altering mens body to builde an argument vpon one cause is most vnreasonable the starres worke vpon the elementes earth water ayre by makyng heate cold moisture drines the elementes how worke they on mens body they will also say by making heate cold moysture dryenesse which is most vntrue for the whotter and dryer the elementes be the colder and moyster by nature are mens body accordyng to that saying of empedocles nature placed a whote body in a cold countrey and a cold body in a whote countrey the philosophers say that all causes are either per se or per accidens now the heauens being causes of the alteration of the senses per accidens they must not bee causes of the inclination of the will either per se or per accidens but per accidentis accidens whiche is most ridiculous this long chayne by whiche they lincke the will of man to the starres if it shalbe applyed vnto particulars it must needes breake for the actions of the will is buying selling trauailyng lying heaping vp wealth murdering spreading of false rumours offer of discourtesies hatyng of kinsfolkes and such like whiche our heauengazers foretell haue no coherete with the first qualities heate cold moisture drynesse neither can they any waye proceede from them and therfore the starres cannot be causes of them for they worke onely by these qualittes this reason is nothyng to their purpose for because they graunt that a man may freely resiste the inclination of the starres amp he may hinder that vnto which the stars bend his wil how dare they presume to say this or that will come to passe the heathen man gaue vp theselues to their own lustes amp vanities and followed euery litle and vayne inclination amp of them in this order did auncient astrologers among them diuine that this or that time such actions such vices such enterprise such affaires should be amog them in like maner our english wiseme speake of vs as though we were beastes not reasonable man as thogh we neuer had heard the blessed gospell of god neuer tasted of the grace of god neuer learned what is good and what is bad neuer laboured to subdue our lustes amp affections alwayes turned to and fro with the blast of any influence working very slenderly in vs thus muche of ciuill affaires they make mentio also yearely of the diseases whiche shall reigne but the way which they follow is taken forth of the barren and vncertaine rules of of the old astrologers who do so ascribe vnto euery planet certaine diseases that if neede shall require they may referre the same disease vnto many significatours as in the plague the putrefaction of humors is attributed vnto iupiter the sharpe feuer vnto mars the madnesse whiche followeth vnto mercurie the whole plague vnto mars in the plurecie the inflammation of the bloud betwene the skinne called pluritis and the ribbs is attributed vnto iupiter the suppuration of the bloud vnto saturne and the whole pluresie vnto iupiter in the iaundes the inflamation and corruption of humors vnto iupiter the yelow humor in the gaule vnto mars the obstruction of the partes vnto saturne the whole iaunds beyng white vnto mars blacke vnto saturne and so in euery disease they vse this inconstancie and ambiguitie in prognosticating it is a rule among the astrologers that if the planets signifiers of diseases be well affected then there shalbe no diseases but health if they be euilly affected then diseases follow our prognosticatours neuer marke this rule but howsoeuer the planets bee affected they straightwayes pronounce that such diseases shall reigne for exaple the last winter quarter it was said by one of them that y e diseases which should afflict mens body were rewmes coughes cold laskes swelling of the face amp throte fallyng of the colmel sore eyes deafenesse the stone goute dropsie greenesicknes madnes quarterne feuers ampc and all the planets signifiers of diseases in that quarter were indifferet well affected wherfore thou hast not one cause to feare their threatninges but rather to be sorie for their continuall deceites wishing them myndes that they may one day see their owne follie concernyng the time when the constellations take their effectes our prognosticators say that some take their effectes the same yeare some not the same yeare but long after as great coniunctions and eclipses for they say if the moone be eclipsed one houre she worketh her effect a moneth after if two houres two monethes after and the sun for euery houre it is eclipsed taketh his effect an whole yeare after truely this rule whiche they follow must needes be agaynst all reason for why should not all coniunctions and oppositios of the sun and moone differre their effectes as well as those coniunctions and oppositions in which the sun and moone is eclipsed if they showe forth their power immediately after why should not these also do the same moreouer the epignosticall astrologers who haue conferred the course of the heauens with history shew very manifestly that eclipses do not deferre the time of working their spite vpon the earth in the yeare of our lord the sun was eclipsed in aries and presently after shewed all his force there was a great sedition in prage that yeare in paris an vprore betwene them of the citie and the uniuersitie and two thousand scholers were slayne then also wenzeslaus king of bohemia being in a great palsie dyed in the yeare there was a coniunction of saturne and iupiter in scorpius amp also a great eclipse of the sun in iune whiche tooke their effectes the same yeare charles king of fraunce driuen forth of his countrey war betweene danes and the man of sleswicke there was a great plague in germany ciuill dissention amongest the princes of the empire and them which tooke the part of john husse an eclipse of the sun in sagittarius his effectes began presently and lasted a great while euen then constantinople was taken by the turke the hungarians and bohemians besieged fredericke the emperour the of aprill the sun was eclipsed in taurus mars beyng in aries and iupiter in sagittarius the same yeare in sommer was such heate and drynesse of weather that woodes euen withered and one might wade ouer deepe river in the yeares of our lord and many yeares after there were both great coniunctions amp straunge eclipses which tooke their effectes presently not one or two or three yeares after as our heauengazers beare thee in hand all these examples whiche i bring agaynst them i haue not fayned but taken forth of those bookes which they haue in greatest estimation and could if neede should serue bring an hundred more all to shew their lyes when as they comonly say thus there shalbe an eclipse this yeare mary i will not here determine his effectes but reserue them to be declared in my prognostication one yeare or two yeares hence when it will take place to know where the effectes of the starres shall take place they haue appointed vnto euery signe certaine countreys as ouer europe they haue set the fiery triplicitie ouer the orientall and north partes of the asia the ayrie triplicitie the waterie triplicitie ouer aphrica ouer y e south partes of the asia the earthie triplicitie amp so euery peculiar signe hath his dominion ouer some partes of those now therefore when a coniunction or eclipse is in any of these signes the cities and countreys subiect vnto them feele the force of that constellation especially this is a most manifest vntruth and may bee confuted by many reasons the nature of the signes is not the same now as it was in tymes past and by the confession of the learned haue other effectes now then they had in the dayes of yet we see the nature of countreys and people to remayne the same still as may bee seene by readyng tacitus plinie caesar strabo america whiche is halfe the worlde hath no signes appointed ouer it why it was founde out of late true it is but this is an argument that y e rules of astrologie are absurde and were the bare inuentions and imaginations of idle braynes for there is no doubt but that america his partes and ilandes as br silea peru pari terra florida iaua major iaua minor puloana pauilonga subath massana mattan iuuacana cozumella iamaica ampc haue felt the force of those constellations whiche they attribute to some partes of the olde world because these countreys bee about the middle zone and haue both planetes and signes full ouer them and therfore if the starres threaten any straunge thynge to come they must especially feele it experience the cause of all actes is agaynst them as is manifest in these examples yeares before the natiuitie of our sauiour christ there was a coniunction of the higher planets in scorpius and then was ciuill war betwene caesar and pompey and the chaunge of the empire was in europe but according vnto the institution of astrologers all these troubles should haue bene in aphrike because scorpius hath his dominion there in the yeare of our lord there was a great coniunction of planets in leo and then sayth one very prophanely was the gospell preached through the worlde but if hee make this coniunction to be a signe of the preachyng of the gospell then it should more haue bene preached in the partes of europe then asia which is not true in the yeares of our lord and there were great coiunctions in virgo and yet the countreys subiect to this signe felt no harme but italy was troubled with the popes superstitions and arrius his heresie was broched there was a meetyng of planetes in sagittarius yeares after christ when as otho galba vitellius and vespasian troubled the romaine empire yet there was no where more gre uous war then in palestine and no greater slaughter then of the iewes who are subiect vnto scorpius and not vnto sagittarius in the yeare a coniunction of higher planets was in pisces vnder whose dominion although europe be not placed yet it most felt the smart by troubles and ciuill war so and two eclipses of the sun the one in leo the other in capricorne tooke their effectes in germany when as leo and capricorne doe not rule that countrey it is vayne to shewe the absurditie of this rule by moe examples these shalbe sufficient this shall suffice to haue spoken of their generall predictions now follow their speciall determinations of the state and temperature of the weather wherein i will set forth first of all a most manifest and absurde contradiction whiche most of them make amp that is this they vse as i haue sayd to set downe their iudgementes of the whole quarter that it should be either moyst hote cold or drye afterward iudging particularly they disproue by particular dayes that whiche they sayd before in the yeare of our lord one sayd that in y e autumne quarter should be a great drought yet i perusing his particular iudgements vpon the dayes of the quarter i finde it should haue pletie of rayne in the yeare last past an other sayd the s mmer should be so hote amp drye that euen welles amp river should be dryed vp and fish be scarce and cattell drye for want of water yes the same partie in his particular iudgement of the weather maketh dayes of the same quarter at the least rayne and misling and other either temperate or very cold in one worde the iudgementes whiche are set downe of the weather they are more tolerable then the rest yet as long as the world endureth no man shalbe able to prognosticate truely what weather shalbe in euery day of the yeare the causes of this i haue set downe before and neede not now to repeate uuherefore they might leaue of anie longer to busie themselues in this kind and it shalbe sufficient for thee leading a christian lyfe to know the generall and ordinarie estate of the partes and seasons of the yeare besides all this the impious speeches and vngodly practises whiche these man vse might moue a christian man to loath their predictions first yeerely some of them doe foretel whether man shall study and imbrace or forget and neglecte true religion uuhat a filthie and diuelish thinge is this not to bee suffered in a common wealth where the gospell of christ is preached euery man naturally is the childe of wrathe the vnprof table servant dead in all kinde of sinne hys vnderstanding it is enmitie agaynst god his affections are rebellious against his will none doth good no not one not one hath anie facultie to receaue or keep true religion we are as sawes in the hands of god as the prophet esay speaketh howe then become wee religious by the onely worke of god no man can come to me saith christ except the father draw him and as god draweth vs first vnto true religion so he also maketh vs continue in the professing of the same as s paul saith hee whiche hath begon a good worke in you wil finish the same ampc by what meanes doth god do this by the outward preaching of the law and the gospell and by the inwarde working of his holy spirite other meanes the scripture neuer mentioneth on the contrary part if anie manne refuse the grace of god and wil not imbrace the true religion it proceedeth from the hardnesse of his owne heart and wilfull rebellion seeing therefore the rebellion of man commeth from his owne will and the imbracing of true godlinesse from god alone uuhy dare they presume without great impietie to adioyne y e constellatios as adiuuats either vnto man or god in this diuine work again these predictions are verie perillous for if a manne be wickedly giuen they hinder him from the acknowledging of his sinne because they make him lay part of his faultes vppon the starres when as all indeede come from his owne soule and if a man be a penitent sinner and feele the grace of god yet being weake in faith and coscience they make him not to put hys whole trust in god and to loue hym with all his soule with all his strength but allure him in som part to attribute that vnto the stars whiche is the onely work of god and not of any creature they vse to foretell what vices shall raigne as in these examples as there shall be much unlawful and secret whoredome great robbing by hyewayes sides vvanton and young woman shall sit in their ladies lappes by reason of theyr goddesses well placing many shall vse deceite and cousening by these and such like lewd amp dissolute people take occasions amp ar stirred vp to liue prophanely amp to folow those vices vnto which y e lusts of their nature carry them a iugler which taketh vpon hym to doe straunge things must vse manie sleightes least if the stander by shall see his trickes of ligierdemayne he be descried and all his former cunning turne to his shame our prognosticatours vnderstanding this haue thought it conuenient to vse in their kind some trickes of deceiuing iuglers i can cal them by no better name for so they are in deede first publishing their predictions in thy behalfe they vse such absurde vnknowne and insolent wordes as i thinke neuer the lyke were red or hard amongest vs in england as are these which follow thou wilt saye what meanes all this here is great learning no doubt it passeth my capacitie who woulde not haue an almanacke if it wer for nothing but for this to see and heare how profounde oure prognosticatours are thou farre deceiuest thy self for they perceiuing well that their deceits and lies may bee soone espied haue inuented straunge tearmes to colour them and to cast a mis e before thine eyes that thou mayst not see their naughtie dealing for any manne the more true and honest he thinketh his matter the more desirous is he to speake plainly to the vnderstanding of all it was a point of the knauerie of the diuell otherwise called apollo as the heathen man asked his counsell to aunswere doubtfully because when as hee was ignoraunt of the euent yet woulde not but seeme to know as in this aunswere it is vnderstood two wayes either that aeacides might vanquish the romaynes or the romaynes aeacides our prognosticatours haue chosen a verie good patterne to follow their dealing with thee is the like when they doubt and cannot tell what to prognosticate then they vse two wayes of foretelling eyther to speak that which is tru euery way or that which is true euerie yeare for the first amongest many examples i will put one or two that thou mayst see their dealing in true not forged examples examples of those predictions which may agree to euerie yeare are common with them as these agayne beside these wayes there is also a third and that is this they fearing lest their prognostications should not bee regarded because of their lyes and that they might winne man vnto the vsing of them haue adioyned astronomicall matters of the rising and settyng of starres of the aspectes and motions of planetes whiche are no profit to thee here also they haue annexed tables of all the faires in the land and of the chief high wayes which beyng of some price with thee make that whiche is naught of it selfe to be of some accompt thus much good reader i hope shalbe sufficient to perswade thee of the vanitie of prognostications if not i beg thee accept of my simple endeuour seruing in som part vnto thy profite for if thou be a christian man thou oughtest only to be conteted with knowing the times and ordinarie seasons of the yeare not regarding nor searching any secret and speciall predictions for whiche the lorde neuer gaue anie man warrant but in plain words hath forbidden the nay they which be ingrafted into iesvs christ indeed are so far from searching what shall be fall hereafter that they lead a life which is a continuall meditatio of present death the which the lord for iesvs christes sake graunt vnto vs that wee may in some measure behold our own vanities

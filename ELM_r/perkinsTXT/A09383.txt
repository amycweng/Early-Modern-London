two things are generally to be considered the occasion of this epistle and the scope the occasion that mooued paul to write this epistle was because certen false apostles slaundered him both in respect of his calling as also in respect of his doctrine teaching that he was no apostle and that his doctrine was false and by this means they seduced the churches of galatia perswading them that iustification and saluation was partly by christ and partly by the lawe the scope of the epistle is in three things first the apostle defends his calling in the first and second chapters secondly he defends the truth of his doctrine teaching iustification by christ alone and vpon this occasion he handles the greatest question in the world namely what is that justice whereby a sinner stands righteous before god in the and and in the beginning of the fift thirdly he prescribes rules of good life in the fift and sixt chapters paul an apostle not of man nor by man but by iesus christ and god the father who raised him from the dead the epistle hath parts a preface an instruction and the conclusion the preface is in the fiue first verses and it hath two parts an inscription and a salutation the inscription sets downe the persons that write the epistle and the persons to whome it is sent the persons that write are two paul amp the brother paul is mentioned in the first verse in which in comely and decent manner he commende himselfe to the galatians by his office and function as apostle that is one called to be a planter and founder of the church of the newe testament among the nation and because the title of an apostle in generall signification may agree to all teachers therefore he goes further and sets downe the cause of his apostleship and first he remooues the false causes in these words not of man that is not called by man as by authors of my calling or not called by the authoritie of man and in this paul opposeth himselse to the false apostles who were called notby god but by man againe he saith not by man that is not called of god in and by the ministerie of any meere man and in this paul opposeth himselfe to all ordinarie ministers of the gospell whatsoeuer who are called of god by man this done he propounds the true cause and author of his apostleshippe of whome he was called immediately against this it may be obiected that paul was ordained to be an apostle by the imposition of hads of the church of antioch i answer that this imposition was rather a confirmation then a calling secondly they of antioch had not imposed hands on paul but that they were commanded by the spirit of god further paul addes that he was called by christ and god the father for three causes the first was to signifie the consent of will in the father and christ the second was to teach vs howe we are to conceiue of god namely that he is the father and iesus christ and the holy ghost for the godhead may not be conceiued out of the trinitie of persons the third is because the father is the fountaine of all good things that come to vs by christ lastly he sets downe the effect or action of the father who raised him from the dead and that for two causes one was to prooue christ to be the naturall son of god for he professed himselfe to be so and that was one cause why he was crucified and put to death nowe when he was dead if he had not bin the son of god indeede he had neuer risen againe but had perished in death and in that the father raised him againe to life he gaue testimonie that he was his own naturall son and therefore paul saith that christ was declared to be the son of god by the resurrection from the dead and he applies the words of the psalme thou article my son this day haue i begotten thee to the time of christs resurrection againe paul mentions the resurrection of christ to note the time of his owne calling for though the rest of the apostley were called when christ was in the estate of humiliation yet paul was called afterwards when christ was entred into his kingdome and sate at the right hand of his father the vse first whereas paul in the very fore front of his epistle beginnes with his owne calling i gather that euery minister of the gospell ought to haue a good and lawefull calling a man cannot preach vnlesse he be sent christ tooke not vnto him the office of a mediatour till he was called and sent of the father therefore the opinion of the anabaptist is foolish and phantasticall who thinke that euery man may preach that will without any speciall calling they alleadge that the house of stephanas ordaine themselues to the ministerie of the saints answer the meaning of the place is not that they called themselues but that they set themselues apart to the ministerie of the saints in the purpose and resolution of their owne hearts againe they alleadge that all christians in the newe testament are kings and priests and the office of the priest is to teach i answer all are priests in that they are to offer themselues in sacrifice to god and to teach priuately within their places and callings as the master his servant the father his children ampc and to make a confession of their faith when they are called so to doe thirdly they alleadge that the power of the keies is giuen to the church i answer it is indeed yet so as the vse and administration thereof belongs to the ministers alone in the dispesation of the word secondly whereas paul saith not of man but of christ i gather that euery lawefull calling is of god and not of man as authors thereof and that the right to call belongs to god the father thrusts forth labourers into the vineyard the son giues pastors and teachers the holy ghost makes ouerseers it may be alleadged that the church hath authoritie to call and ordaine ministers i answer that the churches authoritie is no more but a ministerie or seruice whereby it doeth testifie declare and approoue whome god hath called thirdly whereas paul thus proclaimes his calling paul an apostle of iesus christ i gather that the callings of the ministers of the gospell must be manifest to their owne consciences and the consciences of their hearers and that for diverse weightie causes first they are imbassadours instruments and the mouth of god and for this cause they are to speake in the name of god and this they cannot doe vnlesse they knowe themselues to be called secondly that the calling of the ministerie may tend to edification there is required the assistance of god spirit in the teacher the protection of him and his ministerie the effectuall operation of the spirit in the hearts of the hearers and he that wants the assurance of his calling cannot pray to god in faith for these things neither can he apply the promises of god to himselfe thirdly the knowledge of our callings breeds conscience of our duties diligence and the feare of god lastly knowledge of our callings in the consciences of the hearers breeds a reuerence in their hearts and obedience to the ministerie of the word vpon this some may demaund howe they may knowe that they are called of god to the ministerie of the word answer they may knowe it if they finde three things in themselues the first is the testimonie of their consciences that they entred not for praise honour lucre but in the feare of god with a desire to glorifie him and to edifie the church the second is a facultie to doe that to which they haue a desire and will in this facultie are two things knowledge of god and his waies and aptnesse to deliuer that which they knowe the third is the ordination of the church which approoues and giues testimonie of their will and abilitie he that hath these things is certainely called of god nowe put the case a man wants the first of these three because he entred with euill conscience beeing carried with ambitious and couetous desires then i answer that his calling still in respect of the churh is good and lawefull and when he repents of his bad conscience it is also accepted of god the fourth point to be obserued is that paul makes three kinds of callings in the church one is when man are called by man and not by god and thus are all false teachers called the second is when man are called of god by the ministerie of man thus are all ordinarie ministers of the word called the third is when man are called not by man but by christ immediately and paul here signifieth that he himselfe and the rest of the apostles were called according to this third way and in this respect he puts a difference betweene the apostles and all the ministers of the newe testament for in that they were called immediately they were also taught by immediate inspiration and also aided by the infallible assistance of god spirit and of all this they had promises math luke hence we may gather the certenty of our religion the essentiall note of the church is faith faith stands in relation to the word of god and the word of god is no word vnto vs vnlesse we knowe it to be so and we knowe it to be so because it was written by the apostles who in preaching and writing could not erre secondly hence i gather that the doctrine of the apostles it the immediate word of god because it was giuen by inspiration both for matter and words whereas the doctrine of the church in sermons and the decrees of councels is both the word of god and the word of man the word of god as it agrees with the writings of the apostles amp prophets the word of man as it is defectiue and as it is propounded in tearmes deuised by man it may be obiected that paul spake some things of himselfe and not from the lord corinthian not the lord but i answer the meaning is not the lord by any expresse commaundement but i by collection and interpretation of scripture and that by the assistance of god spirit v seeing then the writings of the apostles are the immediate and meere word of god they must be obeyed as if they had beene written without man by the finger of god lastly seeing it is the propertie of an apostle to be called immediatly by iesus christ hence it follows that the authority office and function of apostles ceased with them and did not passe by succession to any other therefore it is a falshood that the pope of rome succeedes peter in apostolicall authoritie and in the infallible assistance of the spirit when he is in his consistorie and where paul saith he was called by iesus christ and not by man that is meere man he giues a pregnant testimonie that christ is both god and man and whereas paul was called by christ raised from the dead hence i gather the dignitie of the apostle paul aboue all other apostles in that he was called after the resurrection of christ when he was entred into his kingdome the text and all the brother that are with me to the churches of galatia the exposition by brother we are to vnderstand such as seperated themselues from the pagan and receiued the faith of christ corinthian and here more specially such as taught and professed the faith that is both pastors and people whether of antioche as some thinke or of rome as others and paul writes his epistle as well in their names as in his owne and with their consent for two causes one was that he might not be thought to deliuer any priuate doctrine deuised of his owne head and this care he had alwaies and therefore taught nothing but that which was in the writings of moses and the prophets act and this was the care of christ who saith my doctrine is not mine but his that sent me john and at this daie this must be the care of the ministers of the gospell to deliuer nothing of their owne first therefore their doctrines must be founded in the writings of the prophets and apostles and secondly that they may be sure of this they must haue the consent of the true church specially of such as haue beene the restorers of the gospell in this last age this rule paul giues timothie to continue in the things which he had learned of paul and the rest of the apostles tim hence it appeares to be a fault in sundrie priuate persons when they read the scriptures to gather priuate opinions to broch them to the world this practise hath beene the foundation of heresies and schismes in the church secondly paul writes with consent that he might the better mooue and perswade the galatians to receiue his doctrine which he is nowe to deliuer hence it appeares that the consent of pastors and people is of great excellencie for the better conceiuing of it and the meaning of the text i will handle three points the first is what is the force of consent wherein stands it and where it is nowe to be found for the first consent is of force to prepare the heart and to mooue it to beleeue as augustine saith i had not beleeued the gospell except the authoritie of the church had mooued me and this is all it can doe for it is the word that is the obiect and the cause of our faith the word it selfe workes in vs that faith whereby it is beleeued and paul in this place vseth consent not to worke a faith in the galatians but onely to stirre vp a liking of his doctrine two errors of the church of rome must here be auoided one that consent is a certaine marke of the church it is false for consent may be among the wicked in the kingdome of antichrist revelation in the kingdome of darkenesse all is in peace againe dissention may be among the godly as betweene paul and barnabas paul and peter in the church of corinthian there were schismes corinthian consent therefore simply vnles it be ioyned with true faith and true doctrine is not of force to declare vnto vs the true church the second errour is that the catholike consent of beleeuers in pointes of religion is the true and liuely scripture and that he written word is but a dead letter to it and to be iudged by it for his sense and meaning but all is contrary for the written word is the first amp perfect pattern of the mind and will of god and the inward consent in the hartes of man is but a rude and imperfect extract and draught of it the second point is wherein standes this consent it must haue his foundation in christ amp thence flow to the members as the oile from aarons head to his garments psalm and it standes in three things consent in one faith and doctrine consent in affection whereby man be of one hart act consent in speach corinthian the third point is where it is now to be found the papists say that they haue true and perfect consent among themselues and that fathers and councells be on their side and that we haue no consent among our selues i answer first that they haue not the cosent which they pretend for the proper points of popery were not known to the apostles nor to the apostolicall churches but were taken vp in the ages following by little and litle secondly such doctrines as the papists make articles of faith are but opinions and coniectures in the fathers and councles thirdly the things which the papists hold are the same peraduenture in name but they are not the same indeede with that which the fathers hold neither are they holden in the same manner as for example the purgatory which the fathers hold is a thing far different from the purgatory of the papists and so all the rest of consent they may bragge but they cannot shew it as for our selues we all consent in the foundation of religion there is difference about the descent of christ into hell the thing we all hold namely a descent the difference is in the manner whether it be vertually or locally there is difference about the paines of christ in his agony and passion yet all acknowledge the infinite merit and efficacy of the death of christ there is difference about the gouernement of the visible church on earth for the substance of gouernemant all agree but for the manner of execution and administration they doe not that christ is present in the eucharist amp that his body and blood is there to be eaten and drunken all our churches agree and the difference is only touching the manner of his presence namely whether it be spirituall or locall and this is the mercy of god that in all our differences the foundation of religon is not rased let vs pray for the continuance and increase of this consent thus much of the persons that write now follow the churches to which the epistle is sent to the churches of galatia at this time the galatians had made a reuolte and were fallen from iustification by the obedience of christ so as paul was affraid of them chap and yet he called them churches still vsing great meekenes amp moderatio his example must we follow in giuing iudgement of churches of our time and that we may the better doe this and the better releeue our consciences marke three rules the first is that we must rightly consider of the faultes of churches some are faultes in manners some in doctrine if the faults of the church be in manners and these faults appeare both in the liues of ministers and people so long as true religion is taught it is a church amp so to be esteemed and the ministers must be heard math yet may we seperate from the priuat company of bad man in the church corinthian and if it be in our liberty and choise ioyne to churches better ordered if the errour be in doctrine we must first consider whether the whole church erre or some few therein if the errour be in some and not in all it remaines a church still as corinthian did where some denied the resurrection because a church is named of the better part secondly we must consider whether the church erre in the foundation or no if the errour or errours be beside the foundation of religion paul hath giuen the sentence that they which build vpon the foundation haie and stubble of erronious opinion may be saued corinthian thirdly inquiry must be made whether the church erre of humane frailty or of obstinacie if it erre of frailty though the error be in the foundation yet it is stil a church as appears by the example of the galatias yet if a church shall erre in the foundation openly and obstinately it seperates from christ and ceaseth to be a church and we may seperate fro it amp may giue iudgement that it is no church when the iewes resisted the preaching of paul and had nothing to say but to raile paul then seperated the church of ephesus and rome from them act amp it may here be demaunded why paul writes to the galatians as brother and calls them churches seeing they haue erred in the foundation and are as he saith verse remooued to another gospel i answer he could doe no otherwise if a priuate man shall erre he must first be admonished and then the church must be told of it if he heare not the church then iudgement may be giuen that he is a publican and not before much more then if the church shall erre there must first be an examination of the errour and them sufficient conviction and after conuiction followes the censure vpon the church and iudgement then may be giuen and not before and paul had nowe onely begun in this epistle to admonish the church of galatia great therefore is the rashnes and want of moderation in many that haue beene of vs that condemne our church for no church without sufficient conuiction going before if they say that we haue beene admonished by bookes published i say againe there be grosser faults in some of those books then any of the faults that they reprooue in the church of england and therefore the bookes are not fit to conuince specially a church and though paul call the galatians churches of god yet may we not hence gather that the church of rome is a church of god the name it may haue but it doeth in trueth openly amp obstinately oppugne the manifest principles of christian religion if any demaunde what these churches of galatia are i answer that they were a people of asia the lesse and though they were famous churches in the daies of the apostle yet now the country is vnder the dominion of the turke this shewes what god might haue done to vs in england long agoe for the contempt of the gospell this againe shewes what desolation will befall vs vnlesse we repent and bring forth better fruits of the gospell grace be with you and peace from god the father amp from our lord iesus christ who gaue here is laid downe the second part of the preface which is the salutation propounded in the forme of a praier grace and peace ampc grace here mentioned is not any gift in man but grace is god and in god and it signifies his gratious fauour and good will whereby he is well pleased with his elect in and for christ thus paul distinguisheth the grace of god from the gift that is by grace rom v and sets grace before the gift as the cause of it here comes the errour of the papists to be confuted which teacheth that the grace which makes vs gratefull to god is the infused gift of holinesse and charitie whereas indeed we are not first sanctified and then please god but first we please god by grace in christ and then vpon this we are sanctified and indued with charitie peace is a gift not in god but in vs and it hath three parts the first is peace of conscience which is a quietnesse and tranquilitie of minde arising of a sense and apprehension of reconciliation with god rom v the second is peace with the creatures and it hath fiue branches the first is peace with angels for man is redeemed by christ and by meanes of this redemption sinfull man is reconciled to good angels coloss the second is peace with the godly who are all made of one heart and mind isai the third is peace with our selues and that is a conformitie of the will affections and inclinations of mans nature to the renewed minde the fourth is peace in respect of our enemy for the decree of god is touch not mine annointed and doe my prophets no harme againe all things turne to the good of them that loue god the fift is peace with the beast of the field god makes a couenant with them for his people ose the creatures desire amp waite for the deliuerance of god children rom they that trust in god shall walke vpon the lyon and the bafiliske psalm the third part of peace is prosperitie and good successe whatsoeuer the righteous man doth it prospers and all things prospered in the house of potipher when ioseph was his steward because he feared god gen to proceed paul sets downe the causes of grace and peace and they are two god the father and iesus christ and here it must be remembred that the father and christ as they are one god they are but one cause and yet in regard of the manner of working they are two distinct causes for the father giues grace from none but himselfe by the son and christ procures grace and peace and he giues it vnto man from thefather furthermore christ is described by his propertie our lord and by his effects in the next verse the vse whereas paul beginnes his praier with grace we learne that grace in god is the first cause and beginning of all good things in vs election is of grace rom v vocation to saluation is of grace tim faith is of grace philipp iustification is freely by grace rom loue is by grace ioh euery good inclination is of grace philipp euery good worke is of grace ezech ephesians life euerlasting is of grace rom to auoide any euill is the least good and euery good is of god it may be said that will in man is the cause and beginning of some good things answer in the creating or imprinting of the first grace in the heart will is no cause at all but a subiect to receiue the grace giuen after the first grace is giuen will is an agent in the receiuing of the second grace and in the doing of any good worke yet this must be remembred that when will is an agent it is no more but an instrument of grace and grace in god is properly the first middle and last cause of grace in vs and of euery good acte hence it followes that there be not any meritorious workes that serue to prepare man to their iustification and that the cooperation of mans will with grace in the acte of conuersion whereby we are conuerted of god is but a fiction of the braine of man lastly this doctrine is the foundation of humilitie for it teacheth vs to ascribe all to grace and nothing to our selues secondly we learne that the cheife good things to be sought for are the fauour of god in christ and the peace of a good conscience consider the example of dauid psalm v amp psalm v and of paul who accounted all things dung for grace and peace in christ and the peace of good conscience is as a guard to keepe our hearts and minds in christ philipp the fault of most man is they spend their daies and their strength in seeking riches honours pleasures and they thinke not on grace and peace after the manner of beast they vse the blessings of god but they looke not at the cause namely the grace of god our dutie aboue all things to seeke for grace and peace the reason true happinesse which all man desire consists in peace and is founded in grace they are said to be happie amp blessed that mourne amp suffer persecution for iustice sake mat because in the middest of their sorrows amp miseries they haue the fauour of god amp the peace of good conscience thirdly in that grace amp peace are ioyned we learn that peace without grace is no peace there is no peace to the wicked saith my god isai last they which make a couenat with hel amp death are soonest destroyed isai laughter saith salomon is madnes namely when it is seuered from grace and peace when man say peace peace then comes destruction thess the prosperitie of the man of this world ends in perdition read ps paul saith not simply that grace and peace comes fro god but from god the father and from iesus christ that he may teach vs rightly to acknowledge and worship god for god is to be acknowledged and worshipped in the father in christ amp in the holy spirit it was the fault of the pagan and it is the fault of sundrie christians to worship an absolute god without the father and without christ this fault must be amended for it turnes god to an idol againe when paul saith that grace proceeds first from the father and secondly from iesus christ he sets downe the order which god obserueth in the communication of grace amp peace the father is the fountaine of grace and giues it from none but from himselfe christ againe is as it were a conduit or pipe to conuaie grace from the father to vs of his fulnesse we receiue grace for grace ioh in him we are complete column election iustification saluation and all is done in and by christ tim the vse i let them that trauell vnder the burden of a bad conscience and a bad life come to christ by turning from their sinnes and by beleeuing in him and they shall obtaine grace amp finde rest to their soules ii in our miseries our hearts may not be troubled ouermuch but we must alwaies moderate our sorrowes for if we beleeue in christ we shall alwaies haue grace and peace read ioh iii we must moderate our cares for this life for if we trusting in christ haue grace and peace we shall want nothing read psalm v iesus christ that giues grace and peace is called our lord for two causes one is to teach vs to acknowledge christ aright and that is as well to acknowledge him to be our lord as wel as our sauiour he is a priest to procure life a prophet to teach the way of life a lord to command them to walke in the way of life the fault of our times all man professe christ yet many allowe of no christ but of their owne deuising namely a christ that must be a sauiour to deliuer them from hell but not a lord to commaund them that they cannot brooke the second cause why christ is called our lord is to signifie the persons to whome grace and peace belong and they are such as acknowledge christ for their lord and yeild subiection to him in heart and life they finde rest to their soules that take vp the yoke of christ in newe obedience and the patient bearing of the crosse math v who gaue himselfe for our sinnes that he might deliuer vs out of this present euill world according to the will of god our father to whome be glorie for euer and euer amen in these words the second argument is propounded whereby christ is described namely the effect of christ which is that he gaue himselfe and he is said to giue himselfe for two causes first because he presented himselfe as a price and sacrifice for sinne to god the father math ephesians tim the second because he did publikely propound and set forth himselfe to the world as a sacrifice and price of redemption rom ioh and act in this giuing there are fiue things to be cosidered the first the giuer christ the second the thing giuen and that is christ himselfe the third is the ende of his giuing for sinne that is that he might make satisfaction for our sinnes the fourth is another end of his giuing that he might deliuer vs out of this present evil world here the present world signifies the corrupt estate of me that liue according to the lusts of their own hearts ioh and man are here said to be deliuered amp take out of the world when they are seuered from the condition of sinnfull man by sanctification and newnes of life and by diuine protection whereby they are preserued from euill after they are sanctified tit and ioh and this deliuerance is not in this life in respect of place but in respect of qualitie the fifth thing is the cause that mooued christ to giue himselfe and that is the will of god in the verse there is set downe a corollarie or conclusion which containes the praise of god the vse followes whereas christ is the giuer of himselfe hence it followes that his death and sacrifice was voluntarie and this he shewed in two things when he was to be attached he fledde not but went to a garden in the mount as his custome was which was knowne to iudas ioh and in the very separation of bodie and soule he cried with a loud and strong voice which argued that he was lord of death amp died because his will was to die this must be remembred for otherwise his death had not beene a satisfaction for sinne in that christ gaue himselfe to be a sacrifice we learne many things first that the worke of redemption exceedes the worke of creation for in the creation christ gaue the creatures to man in the redemption he gaue himselfe and that as a sacrifice secondly in that he gaue himselfe it appeares that he gaue neither angel nor meere man nor any thing out of himselfe and that all merits of life and satisfactions for sinne are to be reduced to the person of christ and consequently that there be no humane satisfactions for sinne nor meritorious workes done by vs because they pertaine not to the person of christ but to our persons and they were neuer offered of christ vnto god as merits and satisfactions because he gaue nothing but himselfe and the things which appertained vnto his owne person thirdly in that christ giues himselfe we must take and receiue him with hungering hearts nay he is to suffer violence of vs and the violent are to take him to themselues lastly in that he giues himselfe to vs we againe must giue our body and soules vnto him in way of thankefulnes and dedicate all that we haue or can doe to the good of man the creatures at our tables present vs with their body and so must we present our body and soules to god the first ende of this giuing is that christ might be a sacrifice and ransome for sinne the knowledge of this point is of great vse first it workes loue in vs on this manner we must in minde and meditation come to the crosse of christ vpon the crosse we are to behold christ crucified and in his death and passion his sacrifice in his sacrifice for the sinnes of his enemy his endles loue and the consideration of this loue will mooue vs to loue him againe and the father in him secondly the consideration of his endles paines for our sinnes in the sacrifice of himselfe must breede in vs a godly sorrow for them for if he sorrow for them much more we thirdly this knowledge is the true beginning of amendment of life for if christ gaue himselfe to redeeme vs from iniquitie we must take vp a purpose of not sinning and neuer wittingly sinne more lastly this knowledge is the foundation of comfort in them that truly turne to christ for the price is paid for their sinnes and they which are eased of their sinnes are blessed psalm and in temptation they may boldly oppose the satisfaction of christ against hell death the law and the iudgement of god and if at any time they sinne they must recouer themselues and remember that they haue an advocate with the father iesus christ the iust ioh and whereas paul saith that christ gaue himselfe for our sinnes he teacheth that euery man must applie this gift and sacrifice of christ to himselfe this applying is done by faith and the right manner of application is this we must turne to christ and in turning by faith applie and when we applie christ by faith we must withall turne faith goeth before conuersion in order of nature yet in the order of teaching and practise they are both together they which vse to applie christ and his benefits vnto themselues and yet will not turne themselues to christ misapplie and presume because the right apprehension of christ is in the exercises of inuocation and repentance the second ende for which christ gaue himselfe is that he might take vs out of this euill world and hence we are taught three things first that we must be grieued and displeased at the wickednes of the world as lot was pet secondly that we must not fashion our selues to the wicked liues of the man of this world but we must in all things prooue what is the goodwill of god and doe it thirdly seeing we are taken out of this world we must not dwell in it but our dwelling must be in heauen revelation the beast out of the sea perfequutes them that dwell in heauen that is such as dwell on earth and for affection haue their conuersation in heauen and seeing this must be so we must not loue the world but loue the comming of christ and euery day prepare our selues against the day of death that we may enter into our owne home and whereas paul calls this world an euill world he doth it to signifie that there is nothing in man but sinne till they be regenerate yes that ciuill vertues and ciuill life that are excellent in the eyes of man are no better then sinnes before god it is the errour of the papists that man may thinke and doe some thing that is morally good without grace the cause that mooued christ to giue himselfe is the will of god hence it appeares that god giues christ to no man for his foreseene faith or works for there is no higher cause of the will of god the foreknowledge of things that may come to passe goes before will but the foreknowledge of things that shall come to passe and therefore the foreknowledge of faith and works followes the will of god because things that shall come to passe are first decreed and then foreseene the will here mentioned is said to be the will of god that is the first person the father for when christ is opposed to god then god signifies the father and he is most commonly called god because he is god without communication of the godhead from any whereas the son and holy ghost are god by communication of godhead from the father and this god is called our father by paul and hereby he signifies that the scope of the gospel is first to propound god vnto vs not only as a creator but as a father secodly to inioyne vs to acknowledge him to be our father in christ and consequently to carrie our selues as dutifull children to him in all subiection and obedience they which doe not this know not the intent of the gospel and if they know it in deede they denie it the conclusion annexed to the salutation to whome be glorie for euer teacheth vs so oft as we remember the worke of our redemption by christ so oft must we giue praise amp thaks to god yes all our liues must be nothing els but a testimonie of thankfulnes for our redemption and all our praise and thankes to god must proceede from the serious affection of the heart signified by the word amen that is so be it imaruell that you are so soone remooued away to another gospell from him that hath called you in the grace of christ which is not another gospel but that some trouble you and intende to ouerthrowe the gospell of christ here beginnes the second part of the epistle in which he giues instruction to the galatians and it hath two parts one concernes doctrine the other manners the first part touching doctrine beginnes in this sixt verse and continues to the verse of the chapter the summe of it is a reproofe of the galatians for reuolting from the gospell and it is disposed in this syllogisme if i be immediately called of god to teach and my doctrine be true ye ought not to haue reuolted from my doctrine but i was called immediately of god to teach and my doctrine is true therefore ye should not haue reuolted from my doctrine if i be immediately called of god to teach and my doctrine be true ye ought not to haue reuolted from my doctrine but i was called immediately of god to teach and my doctrine is true therefore ye should not haue reuolted from my doctrine the proposition is not expressed because it was needelesse the minor is handled through the whole epistle the conclusion is in the and verses the meaning whereof i will briefely deliuer so soone that is presently after my departure remooued carried away by the perswasions of false teachers to another gospel to another doctrine of saluation which in the speech and opinion of the false teachers is another manner of gospel more sufficient and more excellent then that which paul hath deliuered from him that is from me beeing an apostle who haue called you by preaching the gospell of christ in the grace that is haue called you freely without any desert of yours to be partakers of the fauour of god in christ which is not another which pretended gospell of the false apostles is not indeed another gospell from that of paul because there is but one but it is an inuention of the brame of man but there be some that is but i plainely perceiue the cause of your reuolt that some trouble you and seeke to ouerthrowe the gospell of christ in these words two points are to be considered the first is the manner which paul vseth in reproouing the galatians he tenders their good and saluation and seeks by all meanes their recouerie and therefore in his reproofe he doth two things first he reprooues them with meekenesse and tendernesse of heart following his owne rule gal for he might iustly haue said ye may be ashamed that ye are remooued to another gospell but he saith onely i maruell that is i was well perswaded of you and i hoped for better things but i am deceiued amp i wonder at it secondly he frames his reproofe with great warinesse amp circumspection for he saith not ye of your selues doe remooue to another gospell but ye are remooued and thus he blames them but in part and laies the principall blame on others againe he saith not ye were remooued but in the time present ye are remooued that is ye are in the acte of reuolting and haue not as yet altogither reuolted and hereby he puts them in minde that although they be in a fault yet there is nothing done which may not easily be vndone according to his example we are in all reproofes to shewe loue and to keepe loue to shewe loue to the partie reprooued and to frame our reproofe so as we may keepe his loue the second point is the fault reprooued and that is the reuolt of the galatians which was a departure from the calling whereby they were called to the grace of christ if it be demaded what kind of reuolt this was i answer there be two kinds of reuolt particular and generall particular when man professe the name of christ and yet depart from the faith in some principall points thereof of this kinde was the apostacie of the tenne tribes and such is the apostacie of the romane church a generall reuolt is when man wholly forsake the faith amp name of christ thus doe the iewes and turkes at this day againe a reuolte is sometime of weakenesse and humane frailtie and sometime of obstinacie nowe the reuolt of the galatians was onely particular in the point of iustification and of weakenesse and not of obstinacie and this paul signifies when he saith they were carried by others of this reuo t things are to be considered the time so soone from whome or what from the doctrine of paul amp consequently the grace of christ to what to another gospell by meanes of whome but some trouble you ampc touching the time it was short they were soone carried away this shewes the lightnesse and inconstancie of mans nature specially in matter of religion while moses tarried in the mount aaron and the people set vp a golden calfe and departed from god osea saith the righteousnesse of the israelites was like the morning dewe which the rising of the sun consumeth chap john was a burning light amp the iewes reioyced in this light that is well but marke what is added for an houre or moment john they which cried osanna to the son of dauid shortly after cried crucifie him crucifie him the crosse and persecution will make man call the gospell in question if not forsake it luke the multitude of people among vs are like waxe and are fit to take the stampe and impression of any religion and it is the law of the land that makes the most imbrace the gospell amp not conscience that we may constantly perseuere in the profession of the true faith both in life and death first we must receiue the gospell simply for it selfe because it is the gospell of christ and not for any other by respect secondly we must be mortified and renewed in the spirit of our mindes and suffer no by corners in our hearts where secret vnbeleefe secret hypocrisie and spirituall pride may lurke and lie hid from the eies of man heb thirdly we must not onely be hearers of the word but also doers of it in the principall duties to be practised of faith conuersion and newe obedience to come to the second point when paul saith the galatians were remooued from him that called them that is himselfe he shewes christian modestie because speaking things praiseworthie of himselfe he speaks in the third person from him that hath called ampc the like he doeth corinthian i knowe a man taken vp into the third heauen that is himselfe and john saith the disciple that leaned on the breast of christ whome christ loued asked whome he meant ioh after this practise we are to giue praise to god and to his instruments but neither to praise nor dispraise our selues this is christian ciuilitie to be ioyned with our faith secondly when he saith who hath called you in the grace of christ we learne that the scope of the gospel is to bring man to the grace of christ to this very ende god hath vouchsafed vs in england the gospel more then fourtie yeares and therefore our words and deedes and liues should be seasoned with grace and sauour of it and shew forth the grace of god secondly we owe vnto god great thankfulnes and we can neuer be sufficiently thankefull for this benefit that god calls vs to his grace but it is otherwise the sun is a goodly creature yet because we see it daily it is not regarded and so it is with the grace of god thirdly the galatians are remooued not onely from the doctrine of paul but also from the grace of god and the reason is because they ioyned the workes of the law with christ and his grace in the cause of their iustification and saluation here it must be obserued that they which make an vnion of grace and workes in the cause of iustification are separated from the grace of god grace admits no partner or fellow grace must be freely giuen euery way or it is no way grace hence it followes that the present church of rome is departed from the grace of god because it makes a concurrence of grace and workes in the iustification of a sinner before god and we may not make any reconciliation with that church in religion because it is become an enemie of the grace of god the third point is to what thing the galatians reuolt to another gospel that is to a better gospel then that which paul taught compounded of christ and the workes of the law and this forged gospel the false apostles taught and the galatians quickly receiued here we see the curious nicenes and daintines of mans nature that cannot be content with the good things of god vnlesse they be framed to our minds and if they please vs for a while they doe not please vs long but we must haue new things our first parents not content with their first estate must needes be as god nadab and abihu offer sacrifice to god but the fire must be of their owne appointment king achas will offer sacrifice to god but the altar must be like the altar at damascus false teachers beside the doctrine of the apostles had profound learning of their owne the iewes beside the written law of moses must haue their cabala containing as they supposed more mysticall and excellent doctrine the papists beside the written word set vnwritten tradition which they make equall with the scripture we that professe the gospel are not altogether free from this fault we like that christ should be preached but sermons are not in common reputation learned neither doe they greatly please the most vnlesse they be garnished with skill of arts tongues and varietie of reading this curiousnes and discontentment the lord condemnes when he forbids plowing with the oxe and the asse and the wearing of garments of linsi wolsie and it is the worst kind of discontment that is in things pertaining to saluation it is called by paul the itching of the care and it is incident to them that follow their owne lusts the remedie of this sinne is to learne the first lesson that is to be lear ned of them that are to be good schollers in the schoole of christ and that is to feele our pouertie and in what extreame neede we stand of the death and passion of christ and withall to hunger amp thirst after christ as the bread and water of life read isa ioh psalm the example of dauid psalm when the heart and conscience hath experimentally learned this lesson and not the braine and tongue alone then shall man beginne to sauour the things of god and discerne of things that differ and put a difference betwene grace and workes mans word and god word and for the working of our saluation esteeme of mans workes and mans word as offols that are cast to dogges paul addes which is not another gospel that is though it be an other gospel in the reputation of false teachers yet indeede it is not an other but is a subuersion of the gospel of christ hece i gather that there is but one gospel one in number and no more for there is but one way of saluation by christ whereby all the elect are saued from the beginning of the world to the ende act corinthian it may be demanded how they of the old testament could be partakers of the bodie amp blood of christ which then was not answer the bodie and blood of christ though then it was not subsisting in the world yet was it then present to all beleeuers two waies first by diuine acceptation because god did accept the incarnation and passion of christ to come as if it had beene accomplished secondly it was present to them by meanes of their faith which is a subsistance of things that are not seene and consequently it makes them present to the beleeuing heart againe hence it appeares to be a falshood that euery man may be saued in his owne religion so be it he hold there is a god and that he is a rewarder of them that come vnto him for there is but one gospel and if the former opinion were true then so many opinions so many gospels paul saith that the world by her wisdome could not know god in his wisdome and for this cause he ordained the preaching of the word to saue man corinthian and though he that comes to god must beleeue that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that come to him yet not euery one that beleeues generally that there is a god and that he is a rewarder of them that come to him comes to god for this the deuills beleeue the fourth point is concerning the authors of this reuolt and paul chargeth them with two crimes the first is that they trouble the galatians not onely because they make diuisions but because they trouble their consciences setled in the gospel of christ it may be alleadged that there be sundrie good things which trouble the conscience as the preaching of the law the censure of excommunication the authoritie of the magistrate in compelling recusants to the congregation i answer these things indeede trouble the consciences of man but they are euill consciences and the ende of this trouble is that they may be reformed and made good but the crime wherewith the false apostles are charged is that they trouble the consciences of the godly or the good consciences of man here then is set downe a note whereby false and erroneous doctrines may be discerned namely that they serue onely to trouble and disquiet the good conscience and by this we see the romane religion to be corrupt and vnsound for a great part of it tends this way iustification by workes is a yoke that none could euer beare act the vowe of single life is as a snare or as the noose in the halter to strangle the soule corinthian so is the doctrine which teacheth that man after their conuersion must still remaine in suspence of their saluation and that pardon of sinne is necessarily annexed to confession in the eare amp to satisfaction for the temporall punishment of sinne in this life or in purgatory on the contrary the gospell of christ as here it appeares troubles not the good conscience but it brings peace and perfect ioy john rom and the reason is plaine for it ministers a perfect remedy for euery sinne and comfort sufficient for euery distresse and this is a note whereby the gospell is discerned from all other doctrines whatsoeuer the second crime where with the false apostles are charged is that they ouerthrow the gospell of christ the reason of this charge must be considered they did not teach a doctrine flat contrary to the gospell of christ but they maintained it in word and put an addition to it of their owne out of the law namely instification and saluation by the workes thereof and by reason of this addition paul giues the sentence that they peruer and turne vpside downe the gospell of christ vpon this ground it appeares that the popish religion is a flat subuersion of the gospell of christ because it ioynes iustification by workes with free iustification by christ the excuse that the works that iustify are workes of grace and not of nature will not serue the turne for if christ by his grace make workes to iustifie then is he not onely a sauiour but also an instrument to make vs sauiours of our selues he beeing the first and principall sauiour and we subordinate sauiours vnto him but if christ haue a partner in the worke of iustification and saluation he i no perfect christ but though we or an angell from heauen preach vnto you otherwise then that which we haue preached vnto you let him be accursed as we said before so say i now againe if any man preach vnto you otherwise then ye haue receiued let him be accursed an obiection might be made against the former conclusion thus but the most excellent among the apostles iames peter john by your leaue teach an other gospel then that which paul had preached to this obiection he makes answer in this verse negatiuely that whosoeuer teacheth another gospell is accursed whatsoeuer he be in this answer three things are to be considered a sinne the punishment thereof and a supposition seruing to amplifie the sinne the sinne is to preach in the cause of our iustification any other thing beside that or diverse to that which paul taught the galatians though it be not contrarie thus much the very words import and the same wordes are againe vsed in the next verse and paul bids timothie auoid them that teach otherwise that is any diverse doctrine as necessarie to saluation beside that which he taught tim and the reason of this sinne is because god hath giuen this commandement we may not depart from his word to the right hand or to the left neither may we adde thereto or take therfrom iosu v deut amp before i gather any doctrine hence this ground is to be laid downe that paul preached all the counsell of god act and that which he preached beeing necessarie to saluation he wrote or some other of the apostles ioh this beeing graunted which is a certen trueth two maine conclusions followe one that the scriptures alone by themselues without any other word are aboundantly sufficient to saluation whether we regard doctrines of faith or manners for he that deliuers any doctrine out of them and beside them as necessarie to be beleeued is accursed the second conclusion is that vnwritten traditions if they be tendered to vs as a part of god word and as necessarie to saluation they are abominations because they are doctrines beside the gospell that paul preached and the romane religion goes to the ground because it is founded on tradition out of and beside the written word learned papists to helpe themselues make a double answer one is that they are accursed which preach otherwise then paul preached and not they which preach otherwise then he writ but it is false which they say for that which he preached he writte augustine hauing relation to the text in hand saith that he is accursed which preacheth any thing praeter quam contra petilian l c beside that which we haue receiued in the legall and euangelicall scriptures againe he saith that he must non aliud quid amp us not teach any more or any other thing then that which is in the apostle whose words he must expound the second answer is that to preach otherwise is to preach contrary because as they say precepts and doctrines may be deliuered if they be diverse and not contrary as the gospell of john and the apocalyps were written after this epistle to the galatians which are diverse to it though not contrarie the like they say of the canons of councells and that paul rom put beside for contrarie i answer thus the proposition translated beside or otherwise signifieth thus much properly and we are not to depart from the proper signification of the words vnlesse we be forced by the text and the place in the romans in his proper and full sense must be turned thus obserue the authors of effences besides the doctrine which ye haue learned and pauls minde is that they should be obserued that teach any other diverse or distinct doctrine though it be not directly contrarie the gospell of john and the apocalyps written afterward propound not any diverse doctrine pertaining to the saluation of the soule but one and the same in substance with that which paul wrote the canons of councels are traditions touching order and comelinesse amp they prescribe not any thing as necessarie to iustification and saluation againe the embassadour that speakes any thing beside his commission is as well in fault as he that speakes the cotrarie though not so much the second point is the punishment let him be accursed here are three things to be considered the first what is it to be accursed ans god hath giuen to the church the power of building and it hath degrees admonition suspencion from the sacraments excommunication anathema and this last is a censure or iudgement of the church whereby it pronounceth a man seuered from christ and adiuged to eternall perdition rom corinthian and he is here said to be accursed that stands subiect to this censure the second part is who are to be accursed answer hainous offendours and desperate persons of whose amendment there is no hope and therefore this iudg ment is seldome pronounced vpon any we finde but one example in the newe testament paul accursed alexander the copper smith tim and the church afterward accursed iulian the emperour other examples we finde not any the third point howe the church should accurse any man and in what order answer in this action there be foure iudgements the first is god which is giuen in heauen whereby he doeth accurse obstinate and notorious offendours the second iudgement pertaines to the church vpon earth which pronounceth them accursed whome god accurseth it may be said howe comes the church to knowe the iudgement of god whereby he accurseth answer the word sets downe the condition of them that are accursed and experience and obseruation findes out the persons to whome these conditions are incident the third iudgement is giuen in heauen whereby god ratifies and approoues the iudgement of the church according to that whatsoeuer ye binde on earth shall be bound in heauen the last iudgement pertaines to euery priuate person who holds him in execration whome god hath accursed and the church hath pronounced so to be if he heare not the church the church pronounceth him to be as a publican and heathen amp then saith christ let him be a publican to thee thus must the text be vnderstood hence we we are taught to be carefull in preseruing the puritie of the gospell because the corrupters thereof are to be accursed as the damned spirits hence againe it appeareth that the church in accursing doth but exercise a ministerie which is to publish and testifie who are accursed of god lastly hence we learne that priuate persons must seldome vse cursing because god must first accurse and the church publish the sentence of god before we may with good conscience vtter the same they therefore which in a rage accurse themselues amp others deale wickedly we are called ordinarily to blessing amp not to cursing the third point is the fupposition of things impossible on this manner put the case that i paul or any other of the apostles should teach otherwise then i haue taught you neither i nor they must be beleeued but be accursed againe put the case that an angell from heauen should come and preach otherwise then paul preached to the galatians who must be beleeued paul or the angel the answer is not the angell but paul and the angel must be accursed and the reason is because paul in preaching and writing did represent the authoritie of god and god puts his owne authoritie into the word which he vttered and he was assisted by the extraordinarie immediate and infallible assistance of god spirit from this supposition sundrie things may be learned the first that the word preached and written by paul is as certen as if it had bin written by god himselfe immediately it may be obiected that paul saith corinthian to the remnant i speake not the lord i answer paul saith i not the lord not because he was deceiued in his aduise for he spake by the spirit of god c v but because he gaue counsell in a case of marriage whereof the lord had made no expresse lawe the meaning then is this i speake by collection from the lawe of god and not the lord by any particular and expresse lawe secondly it appeares hence that the articles of faith or the doctrine of the gospell is in excellencie and authoritie aboue all man and angeis and hence it followes that the church and councels cannot authorize the word of god in the minde amp conscience of any man for the inferiour and dependent authoritie addes nothing to that which is the principall and superior authoritie therefore the opinion of the papist is false that we cannot knowe the scripture to be the word of god but by the testimony of the church as though the letter of a prince could not be knowne to be so without the testimonie of the subiects the principall authoritie is sufficient in it selfe to authorize it selfe without externall testimonie thirdly since the daies of the apostles sundrie doctrines haue bin receiued and beleeued touching intercession of saints praier to the dead and for the dead purgatorie and such like and these doctrines haue bin confirmed by sundrie revelations and here we learne what to iudge both of the doctrines and of the reuelations namely that they are accursed because the doctrines are beside the written word and the reuelations tend to ratifie and confirme them lastly hence we learne what to thinke of the writings of papists and schoolemen whereof some are called seraphicall cherubicall or angelicall doctors they broch and maintaine sundrie things beside that which the apostles preached amp wrote as iustification by workes and a mixture of the lawe and the gospell they giue too little to grace and too much to mans will in this regard paul hath giuen the sentence that they are accursed for this cause students of diuinitie are warily to read them with praier that they be not led into temptation and they are to vse them onely in the last place and they are greatly to be blamed that preferre them almost aboue all writers they shewe that they haue little loue of the gospell in their hearts as we said before so say i now againe if any man preach vnto you otherwise then ye haue receiued let him be accursed in these words paul repeates againe that which he said before and the repetition is not in vaine but for three weightie causes the first is to signifie that he had spoken not rashly but aduisedly whatsoeuer he had said before the second is that the point deliuered is an infallible truth of god the third is to put the galatians and vs in minde that we are to obserue and remember that which he hath said as the foundation of our religion namely that the doctrine of the apostles is the onely infallible truth of god against which we may not listen to fathers councels or to the very angels of god if this had bin remembred and obserued the gospel had continued in his puritie after the daies of the apostles in this verse one thing is to be obserued before paul saide they are accursed which teach otherwise then he had taught here he saith they are accursed which teach otherwise then the galatians had receiued whereby it appeares that as paul preached the gospel of christ so the galatians receiued it and they receiued it first in that they had care to know it secondly in that they gaue the assent of faith vnto it as to a truth against which the very angels could take no exception and for this also are the thessalonians commended that the gospel was to them in power and much assurance the great fault of our times is that where as the gospel is preached it is not accordingly receiued many haue no care to know it and they which know it giue not vnto it the assent of faith but onely hold it in opinion and this is the cause that there is so small fruit of the gospel this sinne will at length haue his punishment the places that are not seasoned by the water of the sanctuarie are turned to saltpits ezech v for now whether preach i man or god or seeke i to please man for if i should yet please man i were not the servant of christ the interrogations in this place doe i preach and doe i please are in stead of earnest negations i doe not preach i doe not please and when he saith doe i now preach man or god his meaning is this heretofore i haue preached the traditions of man but now beeing an apostle i preach not the doctrine of man but of god and when he saith doe i seeke to please man his meaning is this i doe not make this the scope of my mini sterie to frame and temper my doctrine so as it may be sutable and pleasing to the affections of man for otherwise we are to please man in that which is good and for their good corinthian rom this verse containes a double reason of his former speach and of the repitition thereof the first is this though heretofore i taught the traditions of man yet now i teach the word not of man but of god and therefore i accurse them that teach otherwise the second is framed thus if i should yet please man i were not the servant of god but i am the servant of god therefore i seeke not to please man but if neede shal be i will denounce curses against them here first we see the proper matter of the ministerie which is not the word or doctrine of man but of god by this the ministers of the gospel are taught to handle their doctrine with modestie and humilitie without ostentation with reuerence and with a consideration of the maiestie of god whose the doctrine is which they vtter that god may be glorified pet secondly the hearers in hearing are to know that they haue to deale with god and that they are to receiue the doctrine taught not as the word of man but as the very word of god as the thessalonians did thess the want of this consideration is the cause that some contemne the ministerie of the word and others are not touched and mooued in hearing againe here is set downe the right manner of dispensing the word which must not be for the pleasing of man but of god hence it appeares that ministers of the gospel must not be man plea nor applie and fashion their doctrine to the affections humour and dispositions of man but keepe a good conscience and doe their office the lord tells ieremie he must not turne to the people but the people must turne to him ierem thus god shal be with them and they shal bring forth much fruit and the people must know it to be a good thing for them not to be pleased alwaies by their ministers the ministerie of the word must be as a sacrificing knife to kill and mortifie the old adam in vs that we may liue vnto god a sicke man must not alwaies haue his minde but he must often be crossed and restrained of his desire and so must we that are sicke in our soules in respect of our sinnes it is a fault therefore of man that desire to be pleased amp to haue matters smoothed ouer of their teachers this is dauids balme which he wisheth may neuer be wanting to his head psalm the ende of this verse sets downe a memorable sentence that if we seeke to please man we cannot be the servant of god hence i gather that our nature is full of rebellion and enmitie against god because they which please man cannot please god againe here is set downe what is the hurt that comes by pride and ambition it keepes man that they cannot be the servant of christ ye beleeue not saith christ because ye seeke glorie one of another ioh ambition so fills the minde with vanitie and the heart with worldly desires that it cannot thinke or desire to please god wherefore he that would be a faithfull minister of the gospel must denie the pride of his heart and be emptied of ambition and set himselfe wholly to seeke the glorie of god in his calling and generally he that would be a faithfull servant of christ must set god before him as a iudge and consider that he hath to deale with god and he must turne his minde and senses from the world and all things therein to god and seeke aboue all things to approoue his thoughts desires affections and all his doings vnto him lastly the profession of the servant of god is here to be obserued in the example of paul who saith doe i now preach man and doe i yet please man as if he had said i haue done thus and thus i haue preached the traditions of man heretofore and i haue pleased man in persequnting the church of god but i doe not so still neither will i and he that can say the like with good conscience i haue sinned thus and thus heretofore but now i doe not neither will i sinne as i haue done is indeede the servant of god v now i certifie you brother that the gospel which was preached by me was not after man the meaning is this that it may the better appeare that i haue iustly accursed them which teach any other gospel and iustly reprooued you for receiuing it i giue you to vnderstand that the gospel which i preached was not after man that is not deuised by man or preached of me by mans authoritie but it was from god and preached by the authoritie of god and this sense appeares by v and in these words is laid downe the reason of the conclusion or the assumption of the principall argument which was on this manner if i be called to teach and that immediatly of god and my doctrine be true then ye ought not to haue reuolted from the gospel which i preached but i was called to teach immediatly of god and my doctrine is true the first part of this assumption is here set downe and handled to the ende of the second chapter and the conclusion as we haue heard was set downe in the premises hence two maine points of doctrine that are of great consequent may be gathered the first is this it is a thing most necessarie that man should be assured and certified that the doctrine of the gospel and the scripture is not of man but of god this is the first thing which paul stands vpon in this epistle it may be demanded how this assurance may be obtained i answer thus for the setling of our consciences that scripture is the word of god there be two testimonies one is the euidence of god spirit imprinted and expressed in the scriptures and this is an excellencie of the word of god aboue all words and writings of man and angels and containes points the first is the puritie of the law of moses whereas the lawes of man haue their imperfections the second i that the scripture setteth downe the true cause of all miserie namely sinne and the perfect remedie namely the death of christ the third is the antiquitie of scripture in that it fets downe an historie from the beginning of the world the is prophecies of things in sundrie bookes of scripture which none could possibly foretell but god the is the confirmation of the doctrine of the prophets and apostles by miracles that is works done aboue and contrarie to the strength of nature which none can doe but god the is the consent of all the scripture with themselues whereas the writings of man are often at iarre with themselues the is the confession of enemy as namely of heretickes who in oppugning of scriptures alleadge scriptures and thereby confesse the trueth thereof the is an vnspeakable detestation that sathan and all wicked man beare to the doctrine of scripture the is the protection and preseruation of it from the beginning to this houre by a speciall prouidence of god the is the constant confession of martyrs that haue shedde their blood for the gospell of christ the is that fearefull punishments and iudgements haue befallen them that haue oppugned the word of god the is holinesse of them that professe the gospell the last is the effect and operation of the word for it is an instrument of god in the right vse whereof we receiue the testimonie of the spirit of our adoption and are conuerted vnto god and yet neuerthelesse the word which conuerteth is contrarie to the wicked nature of man the second testimonie is from the prophets and apostles who were embassadours of god extraordinarily to represent his authoritie vnto his church and the pen man of the holy ghost to set downe the true and proper word of god and the apostles aboue the rest were eie witnesses and eare witnesses of the sayings and doings of christ and in that they were guided by the infallible assistance of the spirit both in preaching and writing their testimonie touching the things which they wrote must needes be authenticall if it be said that counterfeit writings may be published to the world vnder the name of the apostles i answer if they were in the daies of the apostles they by their authoritie cut them off and therefore paul saith if any teach otherwise let him be accursed and they prouided that no counterfeits should be foisted vnder their names after their departure and hereupon john the last of the apostles concludes the new testament with this clause if any man shall adde vnto these things god shall adde vnto him the plagues that are written in this booke reu if any demand of what value is the testimonie of the church i answer consider the church distinct from the apostles and then the testimonie thereof is farre inferiour to the apostolicall testification concerning the word of god for the church is to be ruled by the testimonie of the apostles in the written word and the sentence of the church is not alwaies and altogether certen nor ioyned with that euidence of the spirit wherewith euery testimonie apostolicall is accompanied furthermore that we may be capable of these two testimonies and take the benefit thereof we our selues for our parts must yeilde subiection and obedience to the word of god in this our obedience shall we be assured that it is indeed of god as our sauiour christ saith ioh v this doctrine touching the certentie of the word is of great vse for when the minde and conscience by meanes of the double testimonie before mentioned plainely apprehends it there is foundation laid of the feare of god and of iustifying faith amp before we be assured that the scripture is the word of god it is not possible that we should conceiue and hold a faith in the promises of god and the want of this certentie in many is an open gappe to heresie apostacie atheisme and all iniquitie secondly by this it appeares that the church of rome erreth grossely in teaching that we cannot knowe the scripture to be the word of god without the testimonie of the church in these latter times and that without it we could haue no certentie of religion whereas the testimonie of the spirit or the euidence thereof in scripture with the testimonie of the apostles will doe the deede sufficiently though the church should be silent the second maine point is that it is necessarie that man should be assured in their consciences that the calling and authoritie of their teachers is of god it may be demanded howe we in these daies should be assured hereof i answer thus a diverse consideration must be had of the first ministers of the gospel and of their successors touching the first ministers and planter of the gospel within these yeares we must consider that a calling is of two sorts ordinarie and extraordinarie ordinarie is when god calls by the voices and consent of man following the laws of his word extraordinarie is when god calls otherwise and this he doth waies first by immediate voice thus god called abraham and moses and thus were the apostles called the second is by the message of a creature thus aaron and the tribe of leui was called by moses elizeus by elijah philip was called by an angel to baptize the eunuch act the third is by instinct thus philip a deacon preached in samaria act thus the man of cyprus and cyrene preached among the gentiles and the hand of god was with them though otherwise they were but priuate persons act of this kind was the calling of the first preachers of the gospel it may be obiected that they did not confirme their callings and doctrine by miracles which they should haue done if their callings had beene extraordinarie i answer they preached no new doctrine but the old amp auntient doctrine of the prophets and apostles which they had heretofore confirmed by miracles now old doctrine needes no newe miracles but new doctrine such as are the popes decrees amp decretals againe it may be alleadged that man may falsly pretend extraordinarie calling i answer if three rules be obserued they cannot the first is that extraordinarie neuer takes place but when there is no roome for ordinarie the second that they which plead a calling extraordinarily must be tried by the word both for doctrine and life for this is an infallible way to discouer false teachers math deut iohns authoritie is said to be from heauen because his baptisme that is his doctrine was so luke the third is that extraordinarie teachers in these last daies after they haue brought man to receiue the gospel are to be ordained as other ordinarie ministers after the laws of god word for they are not extraordinarie in respect of their doctrine which is the doctrine of the word nor in respect of their office or function in which regard they are pastors amp teachers and not apostles or euangelists but their callings are extraordinarie in respect of the common abuse of the office of teaching and in respect of the common corruption of doctrine these rules as caueats obserued we may easily perceiue who are called extraordinarily who not and they are all fully verified in the first preachers of the gospell thirdly it is obiected that they which are lawfully called are ordained by them whose auncetours haue bene successiuely ordained by the apostles i answer succession is threefold the first is of persons and doctrine joyntly together and this was in the primitiue church the second is of persons alone and this may be among infidel and heretikes the third is of doctrine alone and thus our ministers succeede the apostles and this is sufficient for this rule must be remembred that the power of the keyes that is of order and iurisdiction is tied by god and annexed in the new testament to doctrine if in turkey or america or els where the gospel should be receiued of man by the counsell and perswasion of priuate persons they shall not neede to send into europe for consecrated ministers but they haue power to choose their owne ministers from within themselues because where god giues the word he giues the power also touching the successours of the first preachers their calling was altogether ordinarie and they were ordained of their predecessours it is obiected that their callings are corrupt i answer thus all actions ecclesiasticall that tende to binding or loosing appertaine properly to the person of christ and man are but ministers and instruments thereof and therefore to call man to the ministerie and dispensation of the gospel belongs to christ who alone giueth the power the will the deede and the church can doe no more but testifie publish and declare whome god calleth by examination of parties for life and doctrine by election and by ordination this is for substance all that the church can doe and all this is allowed and prescribed by the lawes of this church and land and therefore our callings for their substance are diuine whatsoeuer defects there be otherwise this assurance that our callings are of god is of great vse it makes the minister to make a conscience of his dutie it is his comfort in trouble isa corinthian and to the hearers it is a meanes of great reuerence and obedience for neither receiued i it of man neither was i taught it but by the reuelation of iesus christ the meaning is this paul here saith he receiued not the gospel of man because he receiued not the office to teach and preach the gospel from any meere man for here he speakes of himselfe as he was an apostle and then an apostle properly is said to receiue the gospel when he receiues not onely to know and beleeue it but also to preach it and he addes further that he was not taught it that is that he learned the gospel not by the teaching of any man as formerly he learned the law at the feete of gamaliel the last words but by the reuelation of iesus christ carrie this sense but i learned and receiued it of christ who taught me by reuelation further reuelation is twofold one ordinarie the other extraordinarie ordinarie is when christ teacheth man by the word preached and by his spirit in this sense the holy ghost is called the spirit of reuelation ephesians extraordinarie is with the word preached and that foure waies first by voice thus god taught adam and the patriarkes the second by dreames when things reuealed were represented to the minde in sleepe the third is vision when things reuealed are represented to the outward senses of man beeing awake the fourth is instinct when god teacheth by inward motion and inspiration thus did god vsually teach the prophets pet now the reuelation which paul had was not ordinarie but extraordinarie and that partly by vision partly by voice and partly by instinct act amp it may here be demanded where christ was whether on earth or in heauen because paul heard his voice amp saw him visibly i answer he was not on earth but in heauen and that paul both saw and heard him it was by miracle whereas stephen in like manner saw christ he saw him not on earth but standing at the right hand of god in heauen for otherwise the opening of the heauens had bin a needles thing these wordes then are a confirmation of the former verse on this manner the authoritie whereby i teach and the doctrine which i teach i first receiued and learned it not of man but immediatly of christ therefore the gospel which i preach is not humane but diuine and preached not by humane but by diuine authoritie in the scope and sense of the words many points of doctrine are contained the first that christ is the great prophet and doctour of the church math heare him and one is your doctour namely christ and he is called the great shepheard of the sheepe hebr his office is in three things the first is to manifest and reueale the will of the father touching the redemption of mankind ioh amp this he hath done from the beginning of the world the father neuer speaking and appearing immediately but in the baptisme and transfiguration of christ and this he doth to paul in this place the second is to institute the ministerie of the word and to call and send ministers as my father sent me so send i you ioh he it is that giues some to be pastours some to be teachers ephesians and thus appoints paul to be an apostle the third is to teach the heart within by illuminating the mind and by working a faith of the doctrine which is taught he openeth the vnderstandings of his disciples that they may vnderstand the scriptures luke thus here he inlightneth and teacheth paul furthermore it must be obserued that this office of teaching is inseparably annexed to the person of christ and is by him accordingly exequuted euen after his ascension as appeares in the conuersion of paul and therefore isai saith they shall be all taught of god isa as for the ministers of the gospel they in teaching are no more but instrumets of christ to vtter and pronounce the word to the eare this is all they can doe therefore paul saith he that plants or water is not any thing but god that giueth the increase the teacher then properly in the ministerie of the new testament to the very ende of the world is christ himselfe this must teach vs reuerence in hearing god word and care with diligence in keeping of it hebr ampc secondly this teacheth vs that they which imbrace not the gospel among vs are contemners of christ and shall indure eternall condemnation ioh amp hebr thirdly if we want vnderstanding we must pray to christ for it and because we haue so excellent a teacher we must pray vnto him that he would giue vnto vs hearing eares that is hearts tractable and obedient to his word that we may be fitte disciples for so worthie a master the second is that there be two waies whereby christ teacheth those that are to be teachers one is immediate reuelation the other is ordinarie instruction in schooles by the means and ministerie of man the like saith amos i was neither prophet nor son of a prophet but the lord sent me to prophecie to israel amos the third point is that they which are to be teachers must first be taught and they must teach that which they haue first learned themselues tim abide in the things which thou hast learned christ taught that which he heard of the father the apostles that which they heard of christ ordinarie ministers that which they haue learned of the apostles this is the right tradition and if it be obserued without addition or detraction the gospel shall remaine in his integritie here our auncetours are greatly to be blamed who haue not contented themselues with that which they haue learned of the apostles but haue deliuered things of their owne which they were neuer taught hence sprang vnwritten traditions and the corruption of religion againe such are here to be blamed that take vpon them to be teachers of the gospel and were neuer taught by reuelation or by any ordinarie way thirdly priuate persons are much more to be blamed that broch and deliuer such doctrines and opinions as they themselues neuer learned by any ministery for teachers themselues must first learne and then teach the fourth point is that they which are to be teachers are first to be taught and that by man where reuelation is wanting this kind of teaching is the foundation of the schoole of the prophets and it hath bin from the beginning the patriarkes till moses were prophets in their families amp they taught not onely their families in generall but also their first borne that they might succeede as prophets after them there were cities of the leuites dispersed through all the tribes where not onely the people were taught but also schooles erected that they might be taught which were to be priests and leuites number one citie among the rest is called cireath sephar iosu that is the citie of bookes or as we say the vniversitie samuel a yong man was sent to the tabernacle in shilo to be taught and trained vp of eli the priest samuel when he was iudge of israel erected colledges of prophets and ruled them himselfe sam in the decaied estate of the ten tribes elijah and elizeus set vp schooles of the prophets in bethel carmel ampc and the yong students were called the sonnes of the prophets king christ himselfe beside the sermons made to the people trained vp and taught himselfe his apostles and his disciples paul commaunds timothie to teach that which he had learned to such as shal be fit to teach others tim furthermore this teaching is of great vse for it serues to maintaine the true interpretation of scripture the puritie of doctrine and it is a meanes to continue the ministerie to the ende of the world the meanest arte or trade that is is not learned without great teaching then much more teaching is required in diuinitie which is the arte of all arts the true interpretation of scripture and the right cutting of the word is a matter of great difficultie and a matter whatsoeuer man think of the greatest learning in the world therefore it is necessarie that teachers should first be taught and learne aright the gospel of christ eleauen hundred yeares after christ man began to lay aside moses and the prophets and the writings of the new testament and to expound the writings of man as the sentences of peter lumbard hence ignorance superstition amp idolatry come headlong into the world seeing then the teaching of them that are to be teachers is of such antiquitie and vse all man are to be exhorted to put to their helping hands that this thing may goe forward princes are to maintaine it by their bountifulnesse and authoritie as they haue done and doe still and that which they doe they must doe it more parents must dedicate the fittest of their children to the seruice of god in the ministerie and not to vse it in the last place for a shift as they doe for commonly the eldest must be the heire the next the lawyer the youngest the diuine students must loue and affect this calling aboue all other corinthian lastly all man must make praier that god would prosper and blesse all schooles of learning where this kind of teaching is in vse here againe it appeares that christ is god and more then a meere man because he is opposed to man and that paul receiued authoritie and the keies of the kingdome of heauen immediately of christ as well as peter for ye haue heard of my conuersation in time past howe that i persecuted the church of god extreamely and wasted it and profitted in the iewish religion aboue many of my companions of mine owne nation and was much more zealous of the traditions of my fathers in the former verse the apostle set downe that he learned the gospel not of man but of iesus christ immediately this in the next place he goes about to prooue at large his reason is framed thus if i learned the gospell of any man i learned it either before or after my conuersion but i learned it neither before nor after my conuersion of any man the first part of his reason is here confirmed thus before my calling and conuersion i professed iudaisme and i liued accordingly persecuting the church and suppressing the gospel of christ and profiting in my religion aboue many others therefore i was not then fit to heare and learne the gospell of christ of any man this argument he further confirmes by the testimonie of the galatians thus that this was my conuersation in iudaisme ye are witnesses for ye haue heretofore heard as much in the example of paul two points are generally to be considered the first that the distinction of man and man ariseth not of the will or naturall disposition of man but of the grace and mercie of god for paul an elect vessell for nature and disposition before his conuersion is as wicked as any other and he saith rom that the difference betweene man and man before god is not in him that willeth nor in him that runneth but in god that sheweth mercie therefore it is a pelagian errour to thinke that man doing that which they can doe by nature occasion god to giue them supernatural grace the second point is that paul here makes an open and ingenious confession of his wicked life past and hence i gather that this apostle and consequently the rest writ the scriptures of the new testament by the instinct of god spirit and not by humane pollicie which no doubt would haue mooued them to haue couered and concealed their owne faults and not to haue blazed their owne shame to the world and therefore the bookes of scripture are not bookes of pollicie as atheists suppose to keepe man in awe but they are the very word of god againe the end of this plaine confessio is that paul might thereby cofirme and iustifie his owne calling to the office of an apostle this serues to giue a checke to such persons as vse to sit and rehearse their wicked liues past in boasting and reioycing manner in pauls example there be two things to be considered his profession before his calling and his conuersation his profession was iudaisme and this hindred him from imbracing the gospell it may here be demanded what iudaisme or the iewish religion is answer in the daies of christ and the apostles there were three speciall sects among the apostles esseis sadduceis and pharises and the pharises were the principall and their doctrine was commonly imbraced of the iewes and therefore by iudaisme as i take it phariseisme is here meant nowe the principall doctrines of the pharises were these i they held that there was one god and that this god was the father without any distinction of persons for when christ mentioned the distinction of the father and the son they would not acknowledge it john ii they acknowledged in the messias but one nature for when it was asked the howe christ beeing the son of dauid should neuerthelesse be his lord they could not answer math iii they held that the kingdome of the messias was an earthly kingdome and with this opinion the disciples of christ were tain ed iv they held that the keeping of the morall lawe stood in externall obedience as appeares by the speeches of christ reforming their errours math chap v they maintained a naturall freedome of the will in the obseruing of the law luke lord i thanke thee saith the pharisie i doe thus amp thus vi they held a iustification by the workes of the lawe without the obedience of the messias rom vii beside the written word and law of moses they had many vnwritten traditions which they obserued precisely and the obseruation of them was accounted the worship of god math other points they held but these are the principall it may further be demaunded how the iewes could hold such hereticall amp damnable opinions and yet be the people of god answer they had for their parts forsaken god but god had not forsaken them because the temple was yet standing and the sacrifices with the outward worship yet remained among them in this regard they were still a reputed people of god againe they are called a people of god not of the bigger but of the better part and the better part was a small remnant of them that truely feared god and beleeued in the messias of which sort were ioseph marie zachary elizabeth simeon anna ioseph of arimathia nicodemus againe it may be demanded howe the iewes beeing such a people of god should fall away to so danable a religion answer they neither loued nor obeyed the doctrine of moses and the prophets and therefore god in iudgment left them to the blindenesse of their owne mindes and the hardnesse of their own hearts isai the like may be our case if we loue and obey not the gospel more then we haue done our religion may ende in ignorance superstition and prophanenesse as theirs hath done the second thing in pauls example is his conuersation whereby he liued and conuersed according to his religion the like should be in vs for the profession of the faith and godly conuersation are to goe together philipp faith in the hart is a light and workes are the shining of this light math christ hath redeemed them that beleeue from their vaine conuersation pet heere many of vs doe amisse disioyning faith and good life and this fault is the greater because it is an occasion to our aduersaries to mislike and reiect our religion pauls conuersation hath two partes his persequution of the church and his profiting in his religion persequution properly is the afflicting of the people of god for their faith and religion in this we are not to follow paul but to doe the contrary that is by all meanes to seeke the good of the church after god glory immediatly we are to seeke the comming and advancement of the kingdome of god now this kingdome is a certen estate and condition of man whereby they stand subiect to the word and spirit of god and this subiection to god and christ is the propertie of them that be members of the church of god all both rich and poore conferred something according to their abilitie to the building of the temple which figured the church of god the fault of our times is that we build our selues and our worldly estates and little respect the common good of the church in the persequution of the church by paul two pointes are to be considered the manner and measure or accomplishment the manner is that he persequuted the church extreamely or aboue measure that which paul did in his religio we must doe in ours the good things that we are to doe we must doe them with all our might ecclesiastes our dutie is to keepe our hartes in the feare of god and we must doe it with all diligence prou it is our duty to seeke god kingdome and we must take it with violence to enter into life is our duty and we must striue to enter to pray is our duty and we must wrastle in praier rom iosias turnes to god with all his harte the law requires that we should loue god with all the powers of body and soule and with all the strengh of all the powers in earthly things we must moderate our thoughtes amp cares but spirituall duties must be performed with all our might the accomplishment of persequution is that paul wasted the church and made hauocke of it here i consider points what is wasted amp who is the waster for the first it is the church here questios may be demaded the firist is how the church can be wasted answer in respect of the inward estate thereof which standes in election faith iustification glorification it cannot be wasted in respect of his outward estate it may be wasted that is in respect of mens body and in regard of the publike assemblies and the exercises of religion the second question is why god suffers his enemy to wast his owne church answer iudgement beginnes in god house and his iudgements sometime are very sharpe whether they be inflicted for triall or correction of sinnes past or for the preuenting of sinnes to come as in the bodie sometime there is no hope of life except armes and legges be cut off euen so is it in the church hence it appeares that there shall be a last iudgement and that there is a life euerlasting in heauen because the wicked man florisheth in this world and the godly are often oppressed the waster of the church is paul by whome we learne that sinne where it takes place giues a man no rest till it hath brought him to a height of wickednes hatred hauing entred into caines heart leaues him not till it haue caused him to imbrue his hands in his brothers bloud coueteousnes makes iudas at length to betray his master and hange himselfe blind zeale makes paul not only to persequute but also to wast the church therefore it is good to auoide the first beginnings yes the very occasion of sinne the second part and point in pauls conuersion is that he profittes in his religion thus should we profit in the gospell of christ it is god commandement be ye perfect as your heauenly father is perfect that is indeuour to come to perfection all the faith we haue or can obtaine is little enough in the time of temptation iob that said in his affliction though the lord kill mee i will still trust in him saith also that god wrot bitter things against him and made him to possesse the sinnes of his youth it is a token that a man is dead in his sinnes when he doth not growe or increase in good things pet in this regard great is the fault of our daies for many are wearie of the gospell many stand at a staie without profiting many goe backward the cause is this commonly man liue as it were without the lawe and thinke it sufficient if they doe not grossely offend not considering that the lawe of god is a lawe to our thoughtes and affections and all the circumstances of our actions that we may hereafter make good proceedings in our religion we must remember caueats one that we must indeuour to see and feele in our selues the smalenes of our faith repentance feare of god ampc and the great masse of corruptions that is in vs thus with the beggar we shall be alwaies peecing and mending our garment the second that as trauellers we must forget things past and goe on to doe more good psalm the third that we must set before vs the crowne of eternall glorie amp seeke to apprehend it tim thus did moses heb in pauls profiting two things must be considered the measure and the thing in which he profited the measure in that he profited aboue many others hence we learne that in matters of religion there should be an holy emulation and contention among vs and our fault is that we contend who shall haue the most riches and honour or goe in the finest apparell and striue not to goe one beyond another in good things againe pauls modestie must here be obserued he doth not say that he profited more then all but more then many and he saith not more then his superiors but more then his equalls for time and he saith not more then all the world but more then they of his owne nation this modestie of his must be learned of vs for it is the ornament of our faith and therefore must be ioyned with our faith the matter or the thing in which paul profited is that he was aboundantly zealous for the traditions of the fathers here i consider three points i what zeale is answer it is a certen feruencie of spirit arising of a mixture of loue and anger causing man earnestly to maintaine the worship of god and all things pertaining thereto and moouing them to griefe and anger when god is any way dishonoured ii for what is paul zealous answer for the outward obseruation of the law and withall for pharisicall vnwritten traditions which therefore he cals the traditions of his fathers iii what is the fault of his zeale for he condemnes it in himselfe answer he had the zeale of god but not according to knowledge for his zeale was against the word in that it tended to maintaine vnwritten traditions and iustification by the workes of the lawe out of christ rom hence we learne sundrie things for that which paul did in his religion are we to doe in the profession of the gospell first we are to addict and set our selues earnestly to maintaine the trueth and the practise of the gospel christ was euen consumed with the zeale of god house ioh the angell of the church of laodicea is blamed because he is neither hotte nor cold reverand he is accursed of god that doeth the worke of god negligently ierem secondly we are to be angrie in our selues and grieued when god is dishonoured and his word disobeyed when the israelites worshipped the golden calfe moses in holy anger brust the tables of stone dauid wept and paul was humbled for the sinnes of other man psalm corinthian thirdly we are here taught not to giue libertie to the best of our naturall affections as to zeale but to mortifie them and to rule them by the word numb otherwise they will cause vs to runne out of order like wild beast as here we see in paul lastly let it be obserued that paul here condemnes zeale for the maintenance of vnwritten traditions and let the papists consider this but when it pleased god which had seperated me from my mothers wombe and called me by his grace to reueale his son in me or to me that i should preach him among the gentiles immediately i communicated not with flesh and blood neither came i to hierusalem to them which were apostles before me but i went into arabia and turned againe to damascus paul before prooued that he learned not the gospell of any man before his conuersion here he further prooues that he learned it of no man after his conuersion and the substance of his reason is this because immediately vpon his conuersion he conferred with no man but went and preached in arabia and damascus in the words i consider foure things first the causes of pauls conuersion and here he sets down three degrees of causes depending one vpon another the first is the good pleasure of god whereby he doth whatsoeuer he will in heauen amp earth in these words when it pleased the second is his seperation from the wombe which is an acte of god counsell whereby he sets man apart to be members of christ and to be his servant in this or that office this separation is said to be from the wombe not because it began then for it was appointed by god before all times euen from eternitie as all his counsels are but the h ghost hereby signifies that all our goodnesse and all our dexteritie to this or that office is meerely from god because we are sanctified dedicated and set apart in the counsell of god from all eternitie and therefore from the wombe or from our first conception and beginning the third cause is vocation by grace the accomplishment of both the former in the time which god hath appointed the second thing is the manner of forme of pauls vocation in these words to reueale his son to me the third is the end of his vocation to preach christ among the gentiles the last is his obedience to the calling of god in the and verses to begin with the efficient causes of pauls conuersion here we see the order and dependance of causes in the conuersion and saluation of euery sinner the beginning of our saluation is in the good pleasure of god then followes separation or election to eternall life then vocation by the word and spirit then obedience to the calling of god amp after obedience euerlasting life this order paul here sets down and the consideratio of it is of great vse hence it appeares to be a doctrine erronious which beginnes our saluation in the preuision of mans faith and good workes for in paul order workes haue the last place and it must be god pleasure that man shall doe a good worke before he can doe it and if seperation to eternall life should be according to faith or workes then we should make seperation of our selues as well as god and vocation is not for workes but that we might doe good workes ephesians secondly by this order it appeares that the saluation of them that beleeue is more sure then the whole frame of heauen and earth because it is founded in the vocation of god which is without repentance in the counsell of seperation and in the pleasure of god thirdly by obseruing well this order we may attaine to the assurance of our election for if thou hast beene called and hast in trueth answered to the calling of god by obedience thou maist assure thy selfe of thy seperation from the womb to euerlasting life because this order is as it were a golden chaine in which all the linkes are inseperably vnited lastly the consideration of this order serues to mortifie the pride amp arrogancie of our hearts in that it ascribes all to god and nothing to man in the cause of saluation read ezech againe by the consideration of these causes we gather that god hath determined what he will doe with euery man and that he hath in his eternall counsell assigned euery man his office and condition of life for there is in god a pleasure whereby he may doe with euery man what he will and by his eternall counsell he seperates euery man from the very wombe to one calling or other and accordingly he calles them in time by giuing giftes and will to doe that for which they were appointed and this i vnderstand of all lawful callings in the familie church or common wealth thus christ was called from the wombe and set apart to be a mediatour isai and john ieremie to be a prophet ierem christ is said to giue apostles prophets pastors teachers ephesians god sent ioseph vnto egipt to be the gouernour thereof and a releeuer of iacobs familie gen in this regard the medes and persians are said to be the sanctified ones of god isai and the man of his counsell isa the vse hence we are all taught to walke in our callings with diligence and good conscience because they are assigned vs of god hence we are taught to yeeld obedience to our rulers amp teachers because they that are our rulers and teachers were seperated from the wombe to be so and that by god himselfe without the will of man hence we may gather assurance of god protection and assistance in our callings for in that he hath appointed vs our callings he will also defend vs in them corinthian isay hence we may learne patience and contentation in all the miseries and troubles of our callings for in what calling soeuer thou article thou wast ordained to it by god from thy mothers wombe thinke on this hece we learne thankfulnes to god because our calings giftes and the exequution of our callings is wholy of god and this paul signifies when he saith that our seperation to our offices and callings was from our first conception hence we learne to depend on god prouidence for the time to come for if he prouided our callings when we were not he will much more aide and blesse vs in them now while we haue a beeing read psalme poore parents that cannot leaue landes and liuings to their children after their decease let them comfort themselues in this that there children are from their mothers wombe seperated to some good office and condition of life by the wisdome of god and that a good office or calling is better then land and liuing thirdly it appeares hence that the time of all euentes is determined in the counsell of god for god determines with himselfe the time in which he will call and conuert paul by this we are taught in our praiers not to limit god to any time for the accoplishment of our requests for the disposition of time is his and that is to be left to his wisdome againe in our afflictions and temptations we may not make hast for helpe and deliuerance before the time but waite the leasure of god who hath decreede the time of deliuerance he that beleeues makes no hast isai habacuk must waite because the vision is for a time appointed hab dauids eyes and strength failed in waiting on god psalm daniel waites on god yeares and then praies for deliuerance out of captiuitie the time beeing expired this serues to discouer the wickednes of them that beeing in any kind of miserie cannot staie the leasure of god till he deliuer them by good meanes but they will haue present remedie though it be from the deuill and if helpe cannot be had when they desire they presently make away themselues the second point is the forme of the calling or conuersion of paul in these wordes to reuele his son in me that is to teach me the doctrine of the redemption of mankind by the son iesus christ here i consider to whome reuelation is made and how for the first reuelation of the son is made to cruell and persequuting paul a desperate sinner hence euery man can gather that god hath mercy for great and notorious offenders as for paul and such like and the collection is good for god is much in sparing isai and yet here it must be remembred that all desperate offenders shall not finde mercie vnlesse they be great in their repentance as god is great in mercy for god mercy hath a double effect in vs one is remission of sinne by the imputaton of the merit of christ the other the mortification of originall sinne by his efficacie and these two be inseperable as we see in paul on whome god shewed great mercie whose repentance also was notable as the woman john had many sinnes forgiuen her so shee loued much v by this we see the great and common abuse of the mercy of god man euery where presume vpon the greatnes of god mercie and they make christ a packe horse lading him with their burdens and there is little or no amendment of life the manner that god vsed in reuealing the son to paul stands in two things preparation and instruction preparation is a worke of god whereby he humbled paul subdued the pride and stubbernenesse of his heart and made him tractable and teachable this humiliation is outward or inward the outward was partly by lightening from heauen that cast him to the earth and made him blinde and partly by a voice reproouing him saul saul why persecutest thou me the inward humiliation was in a sight and horrour for his sinnes the sinnes that god reuealed to him are these the first was an height of wickednesse that in persecuting the church he made war euen against god himselfe secondly god made manifest vnto him the meaning of the tenth commandement and that secret lust without consent of will was sinne rom and thus the lawe killed him that was aliue in his owne opinion when he was a pharise the instruction whereby god taught the same to paul hath two parts the first is the call of god whereby he inuites paul to become a member of the son of god and this he did first by propounding vnto him the commandement of the gospel which is to repent and beleeue in christ secondly by offer to him the promise of remission of sinnes and life euerlasting when he beleeued the second part of instruction is a reall and liuely teaching when god made paul in his heart to answer the calling according to that psalme v when thou saidst seeke ye my face mine heart answered i will seeke thy face o lord and in zachary he shall say it is my people and they shall say the lord is our god this is a spirituall eccho that is made in the heart the sound of god word goes through the world and the hearts of man which be as rocks and stones make answer and this worke of god that makes man yeild to the calling of god is in scripture a kind of diuine teaching thus the father is said to teach the son by drawing ioh and god is said to teach vs his waies when he guids vs by his spirit in the land of righteousnesse psalm that this reall and heauenly kind of teaching may take place god by his grace puts a kind of softnesse into the heart whereby it is made subiect and obedient to the word and it hath two parts one is an acknowledgement by faith that the son is our redeemer the second is regeneration which is the putting off the old man and the putting on of the newe which to doe by the vertue of christ is to learne christ ephesians thus then god reueales the son to paul by preparing him and making him teachable by propouding the doctrine of saluation to him and by causing him inwardly to beleeue it and to obey it and thus we see the manner of the calling and conuersion of paul for the better cleering of this doctrine fiue questions are to be answered the first is what was the preuenting grace in the conuersion of paul answer schoolemen and papists generally teach that it was the inspiration of good motions and desires into the heart of paul but it is false which they teach for the heart is vncapable of any good desire or purpose till it be regenerate the trueth is this that the preuenting grace in the first conuersion is the grace of regeneration and secondly the inspiration of good desires and motions when christ preuents lazarus that he may reuiue againe he first puts a soule into him and then he calls vnto him and saith come forth lazarus because he was dead in like manner we are dead in sinne and therefore regeneration which is the soule of our soules must be put into vs before any inspiration of heauenly motions can take place yet after we are once borne anew good motions and desires put into our hearts may be the preuenting grace for the doing of sundrie good workers the second question is whether the will of paul were an agent or cause in the effecting of his first conuersion answer no scripture makes two sorts of conuersion one passiue when man is conuerted by god in this man is but a subiect to receiue the impression of grace and no agent at all for in the creating setting or imprinting of righteousnesse and holinesse in the heart will can doe nothing the second conuersion is actiue whereby man beeing conuerted by god doth further turne amp conuert himselfe to god in all his thoughts wordes and deeds this conuersion is not onely of grace nor onely of will but partly of grace and partly of will yet so as grace is the principall agent and will but the instrument of grace for beeing first turned by grace we then can mooue and turne our selues and thus there is a cooperation of mans will with god grace and austen said truely he that made thee without thee doeth not saue thee without thee the third question is whether god did offer any violence to pauls minde and will in his conuersion ansvver there is a double violence or coaction one which doth abolish all consent of will and this he vsed not the other draws out a consent from the will by causing it of an vnwilling will to become willing this coaction or violence god offered to paul and in this sense they which come to christ are said to be drawne ioh the fourth question is wherein standes the efficacie of the preuenting grace whereby paul was effectually conuerted answer the councell of trent and sundrie papists incline to this opinion to thinke that it stands in the euent in that the will of man applies it selfe to the grace which god offereth but then the efficacie of grace must be from mans will and then man hath something whereof to boast and he is to thanke himselfe for the grace of god other papists place the efficacie of grace in the congruitie or aptnesse of motions or heauenly perswasios presented to the mind of the ma that is to be couerted but this opinion also is deuoid of trueth for there is no efficacie in any motions or perswasions till there be a change and newe creation of the will the true answer is this outward meanes are effectuall because they are ioyned with the inward operation of the spirit inward grace is effectuall because god addes to the first grace the second grace for hauing giuen the power to beleeue and repent he giues also the will and the deede and then faith and repentance must needs followe and herein stands the efficacie of the first grace that god addes vnto it and workes the will and the deede philipp the last question is whether it was in the power of pauls will to resist the calling or the grace of god answer the will for his condition is apt to resist grace neuer the lesse if we consider the efficacie of god grace and the will of god he could not resist the calling of god euery one that hath heard and learned of the father comes to christ ioh god will determines and limits the will of man and mans will is an instrument to effect the will of god it may be here demanded howe the efficacie of grace may stand with the libertie of mans will if it haue not libertie to accept or refuse the grace of god ans libertie and freedome of will in god is perfect libertie nowe god cannot will either good or euill but onely that which is good and mans will the neerer it comes to this will of god the greater libertie hath it therefore to wil that onely which is good so it be freely without compulsion is true libertie to be able to will that which is euill and to resist the calling of god is not libertie but impotencie and he that can onely will that which is good doth more freely will good and hath more libertie then he that can will either good or euill the vse ministers of the gospell must learne christ as paul learned him they may not content themselues with that teaching which they find in schooles but they must proceede further to a reall learning of christ and that is to beleeue in the son of god to die to their sinnes by the vertue of his death and to liue to god by the vertue of his life this is a reall amp liuely learning of christ they that must conuert others it is meete they should be effectually conuerted john must first eate the booke and then prophecy revelation and they that would be first ministers of the gospell must first themselues eate the booke of god and this booke is indeede eaten when they are not only in their mindes inlightned but their hartes are mortified and brought in subiection to the worde of christ vnlesse christ be thus learned spiritually and really diuines shall speake of the word of god as man speake of riddles and as preists in former time said their mattens when they hardly knewe what they saide againe students in euery faculty are with paul to learne christ and that as he learned him such persons desire and loue good learning nowe this is the best learning of all to learne to knowe and to acknowledge christ the knowledge of christ crucified is pauls learning the knowledge of the remission of our sinnes is the learning of dauid that great prophet for this title he giues to the psalme the vnderstanding of dauid lastly all man are on this reall manner with paul to learne the same for he is an example to all that shall beleeue in him to life euerlasting tim paul biddes vs doe the good things which we haue seene in him philip hoc vrge the third point is the end of paules conuersion in these wordes that he might preach him among the gentiles here i consider what he must preach namely the son christ and to whome i namely among the nation againe of the preaching of christ i consider two thinges the first is why christ must be preached rather then moses answer there be two causes one is because christ is the substance or subiect matter of the whole bible for the summe of the scriptures may be thus gathered together the son of god made man and working our redemption is the sauiour of mankind but iesus the son of marie is the son of god made man working our redemption therefore iesus the son of marie is the sauiour of mankind the major is the summe of the old testament the minor is the summe of the new and the conclusion is the scope of both the second cause is the law is the ministerie of death and the gospell which is the doctrine of saluation by the son is the instrument of god to beginne and to confirme all graces of god in vs that are necssarie to our saluation therefore the doctrine principally to be preached is the gospell and not the lawe secondly it may be demanded what it is to preach christ answer it is a great worke and it containes ministeriall actions the first generally to teach the doctrine of the incarnation of christ and of his three offices his kingly office his propheticall office and his priesthood with the exequution therof the second to teach that faith is an instrument ordained of god to apprehend and to applie christ with his benefits the third is to certifie and to reuele to euery hearer that it is the will of god to saue him by christ in particular so be it he will receiue christ for when the gospell is preached god thereby signifies vnto vs that his will is to giue vs life euerlasting ioh the last is to certifie and to reueale to euery particular hearer that he is to apply christ with his benefits to himselfe in particular and that effectually by his faith that a change and conuersion may followe both in hart and life ioh and thus when these things are rightly performed christ is preached hence it appeares that to learne christ is not only to know him generally but also effectually to apply him to our selues by our faith that there may be a change and renouation of the whole man they which learne christ must thus learne him els can they not be saued the second point is that paul must preach to the gentiles there be two causes of it one that the prophecies of the calling of the gentiles might be fulfilled psalm and isai the second because at the death of christ the deuision which was betweene the iewes and gentiles was quite abolished ephesians here i obserue the difference betweene apostles and ordinary ministers their charge is a sett and particular congregation whereas the charge of an apostle is the whole world the and last point is the obedience of paul to the calling of god in that he went and preached the gospell here a question may be demaunded whether paul performed his obedience by vertue of the grace which he had formerly receiued without the helpe of new and speciall grace or noe answer noe his obedience proceedes from the first grace helped or excited by speciall grace in the regenerate that haue power to doe good god workes the will and the deede in euery good worke philipp and it is a certaine truth we doe not that which we are able to doe vnlesse god make vs doe it as he made vs able to doe it therefore to the dooing of euery new acte there is new and speciall grace required in pauls obedience i consider points when he obeyed immediatly how without deliberation or consultation when in arabia and damascus for the first in that he obeied god in going to preach im mediatly we learne how we are to answer and obey the calling of god that calles to amendment and newnesse of life namely in all hast without deferring of time hebr to daie if ye will heare his voice harden not your hartes and v exhort one another while it is called to day psalm i made hast and did not delaie to keepe thy commandements and there be good reasons why we should no longer deferre our conuersi on to god the ende of our life is vncerten and looke as death leaues vs so shall the last iudgement find vs secondly when we delay our repentance we add sinne to sinne and so treasure vp wrath against the day of wrath rom thirdly when we deferre to obey and turne to god we growe to perfection in sinne and sinne beeing perfected bringes forth death i am lastlie late repentance is seldome or neuer true repentance for when man are dying their sinnes forsake them and they doe not commonly forsake their sinnes god hath called vs in england more then yeares together and yet many of vs haue not listned to the call of god but deferred to obey let vs now presently amend and turne to god least if we still deferre the time of our repentance god iudgements come forth in hast vpon vs the manner of his obedience is that paul did not communicate with man that is conferre and consult with them touching his doctrine and calling and this he amplifies by a comparison thus he did not consult with any man no not the apostles of hierusalem and he addes a reason of his doing because they were but flesh and blood in respect of god and indeede it is vnmeete to consult with man touching the matters of god hence i gather that god word whether preached or written doth not depend on the authoritie of any man no not on the authoritie of the apostles themselues it is sufficient to authorize it selfe christ receiues not the testimonie of man john and it is an errour to thinke that the church doth authorize the word and religion in the consciences of man for the church it selfe is founded on the word the church cannot consist without faith nor faith without the word secondly hence i gather that there is no consultation or deliberation to be vsed at any time touching the holding or not holding of our religion he that will followe christ may not put his hand to the plough and then looke backe againe to his friends to see what they will say luke he that would be wise must denie his owne wisdome and become a foole corinthian the three children would not consult touching the worshipping of the image but said be it knowne to thee o king that we will not worship thy god daniel when the iudge gaue cyprian the martyr leaue to deliberate a while whether he would denie his religion he answered that in diuine matters deliberation is not to be vsed by this i gather that the schoolemen haue done euill which haue turned all diuinitie into questions and haue made of the articles of our faith a questionarie diuinitie secondly by this we are taught that in the day of triall we may not consult of the change of religion but we must be resolute and tread vnder foote the perswasions of flesh and blood thirdly our obedience to god must be without consultation we must first trie what is the will of god and then absolutely put it in exequution leauing the issue to god abraham is called of god to forsake his country amp kindred gen he derectly then giues attendance to the commandement and goes as it were blind fold he knowes not whither god promised him a childe in his old age he beleeues god without any reasoning or disputing the case with himselfe too or fro rom but the common manner is though we knowe the will of god to dispute the case and to consult with our friends and to practise according to carnall counsell eue listens to the counsell of satan and neglects god commandement saul beeing forbidden to offer sacrifice in gilgal till samuel came to doe it consults with himselfe whether he may doe it or no and followes his owne reason against god commandement and lost his kingdome for it and this kind of deliberation whereby me consult what is to be done is the cause of the manifold rebellions of man in the world in that man is tearmed here flesh and blood we are taught not to put confidence in man we are taught to humble our selues before god we are taught euery day to prepare our selues against the day of death and the day of iudgement yes to account euery new day as the day of death because we are but flesh and blood the third point is where paul first preached namely in arabia and damascus arabia is a region of the world where mount sina standes and where the children of israel wandered yeares the inhabitant thereof were of two forts some more ciuill and some barbarous ciuill as the israelites amalechites madianites ampc yet were they professed enemy of the people of god barbarous as the easterne part of arabia to ward babylon for the inhabitant dwelt in tents and liued like wilde and savage man by robbing and stealing and consequently by killing isai ierem here we see pauls estate and condition when he first begins the exequution of his apostolicall function god then laies vpon him a sharpe and waightie triall for he goes alone into arabia and he must become a teacher to his owne professed enemy yes to a savage generation of whose conuersion he had no hope in mans reason and this hath bin an vsuall dealing of god with his owne servant when moses was called to deliuer the israelites and was in the way the lord for a defect in his family comes against him to destroy him exod da uid is annointed king of israel and withall saul is raised vp to persecute him and to hunt him as man hunt partridges in the mountaines ionas is called to preach to niniue and withall god forsakes him and leaues him to himselfe so as he is cast into the sea and deuoured of a fish and after this beeing deliuered he must goe preach at niniue when christ was in his baptisme as it were inaugurated the doctor of the church presently after before he begun to preach he is carried into the wildernesse to be with wild beast and to be tempted of the deuill mark v and the reasons of this dealing of god are manifest by this meanes sinnefull man are made fit for the office of teaching for the saying is true reading praier and temptation make a diuine againe by this meanes they are caused to depend on the prouidence and protection of god and they are made fit for the assistance and presence of god spirit who dwels onely with them that are of humble and contrite hearts nowe then let not them that in any notable change of their liues finde notable temptations be discouraged for this is a condition that befalls them by a wise and speciall prouidence of god for it was the spirit of god that led christ into the wildernesse to be tempted after his baptisme againe here we are taught to acknowledge three things in god his power in that he sets vp his kingdome where it is most oppugned and raignes in the middest of his owne enemy namely the wicked and savage arabians according to that in the psalme v his goodnes in that he sends paul to preach repentance to the people that are in the snare of the deuill at his will tim his trueth in that he nowe fulfils things foretold by dauid psalm the kings of sheba amp saba shall bring gifts that is ethiopians and arabians then after three yeares i came againe to ierusalem to visit peter and abode with him fifteene daies paul hauing prooued before that he learned not the gospel of any man no not of the apostles at hierusalem goes about nowe to answer exceptions that might be made against his reason and first of all it might haue beene obiected that he was seene at hierusalem sundrie times and therefore in all likelyhood went thither to be instructed to this he answers three things that he went thither three yeares after his conuersion and not before that he went to visit peter that he abode there fifteene daies for the first where he saith he preached yeares in arabia and damascus and then after went to hierusalem and abode there fifteene daies for some speciall causes we see paul is readie and able to make a good account of the spending of his time both for daies and yeares and good reason for time is pretious and great care ought to be had of the expending of it after pauls example we must so liue that we may be able to giue a good account of the spending of our daies that this may be done we must learne to number our daies and to redeeme the time to number our daies is to consider the shortnesse of our liues and that we are euery day subiect to death and withall seriously to bethinke our selues of the causer of this our condition namely our sinnes both originall and actuall when this twofold consideration takes place we then beginne to number our daies the numbring of our time and the parts thereof brings vs to the redeeming of it to redeeme our time is to take time while time serues specially for spirituall vses and for the amendement of our liues when time is thus numbred and redeemed then shall the good account be made before god and man wherefore miserable is the case of them that spend their daies in idlenes in riot and sporting in chambering and wantonnesse for they neither number time nor redeeme it and therefore they are farre from any good account the second point is that paul goes vp to hierusalem to visit peter that is to see him to be acquainted with him to talke and conferre with him hence it appeares that there is a lawefull kind of peregrination or pilgrimage in that paul iourneies fro arabia to ierusalem to see peter thus the queene of saba went vp to ierusalem to heare the wisdome of salomon the lawe of god was that all the males in israel should thrise in the yeare goe vp to the place which god had appointed deut this law was practised by elkana amp anna sam by ioseph and marie by the steward of candaces queene of ethiopia act neuerthelesse popish pilgrimage is vtterly to be condemned for two causes one is because it is made a part of god worship whereas nowe in the newe testament all religious distinction of places is abolished tim lift vp pure hands in euery place vnto god some alleadge that vows which were not commanded were neuerthelesse parts of god worship among the iewes i answer though man were not commaded to vowe yet the matter and forme of vowes was commanded and in that god commanded the manner of vowing he allowed the acte of vowe making let the papists shew the like allowance for their pilgrimage the second reason is because popish pilgrimage is not to liuing man but to the reliques and images of dead man which kind of peregrination was neuer vsed in the world till after the apostles daies for pilgrimage to reliques came in yeares after christ and pilgrimage to images after yeares in that paul goes about to visit peter the papists gather the primacie of peter ouer all the apostles but falsely for this visitation argues reuerence and reuerence is giuen not onely to superious but also to equalls againe primacie is twofold primacie of order and primacie of power primacie of order was due vnto peter in that he was first called to be an apostle and he was in the faith before paul and in this regard he was reuereced of him the third point is that paul abides with peter at ierusalem and that fifteene daies his abode with peter was in token of mutuall consent and fellowship like should be the consent of the ministers of the gospell for their office is to publish and perswade peace betweene god and man to which they are vnfit that cannot maintaine peace among themselues and all beleeuers should be of one minde speaking and thinking the same things and this cannot be vnlesse there be a consent of them that are guides this consent therefore is to be maintained and greatly to be praied for and when there cannot be consent of iudgement by reason of humane frailtie yet so long as the foundation is maintained there must be consent in affection and iniuries offered may not dissolue this bond though the church of ierusalem suspected paul and would not at the first acknowledge him for a disciple act yet did he for his part accept of their loue and fellowship whereas he addes that his abode with peter was but for daies hereby he signifies that he learned not the gospell of him for it could not be learned in so short a space neither could paul by the teaching of any man become an apostle in so little time and none other of the apostles sawe i saue iames the lord brother it might happily be obiected against the former verse that paul might be taught of some other apostle beside peter and that at ierusalem to this he answers two things one that there was none of the apostles at ierusalem but iames beside peter before named the second that he did but see iames here i gather that if there be any mother church in the world it is rather ierusalem then rome because the gospel was first preached there amp went thence into the whole world and ierusalem was for a time guided by two of the cheefe apostles iames and peter in that iames is called our lord brother three things may be demanded one which iames this was answer it was iames the son of alpheus for he liued yeares after this gal whereas iames the son of zebedeus liued not so long because he was put to death by herod the second thing is how iames should be the lord brother answer in scripture children of the same wombe are brother man of the same bloud are brother as abraham and lot gen man of the same country are brother thus sauls countrimen are called his brother chronicle and iames is called our lordes brother not beacuse he was of the same wombe but because he was of the same bloud or kindred for elie had two daughters marie espoused to ioseph amp marie cleophas who afterward was maried to alpheus of whome came iames here mentioned iames therefore was the cosin german of christ therefore heluideus failed when he went about to insringe the perpetuall virginitie of the virgin marie out of this place as if she had more sonnes beside christ the third thing is what benefit iames had by beeing the lord brother answer he is here called the lord brother only for distinctions sake in respect of the other iames the son of zebedeus and this brother hood doth not make him the better apostle or the better man outward things doe not commende vs to god and it is the spirituall kindred by meanes of faith and our new birth that bringes vs into fauour with god mathew nowe the things which i write i speake before god i lie not before paul hath auouched sundrie thinges of himselfe that he preached in arabia amp damascus that he went thence to ierusalem that he did not learne the gospell there of peter iames or any other apostle now some man might happily say that these sayings of his are but false and fabulous auochments therefore in this verse paul defends himselfe and iustifies his owne sayings by a diuine testimony the wordes containe partes an answer to an obiection concealed on this manner i may be thought to lie but indeede i lie not the second is a confirmation by oath before god i speake it touching the first parte there be two pointes to be handled what is a lie and whether it be a sinne or no a lie is when we speake the contrarie to that we thinke with an intention to deceiue more plainly in a lie there be thinges the first is to auouch and affirme that which is false the second is to speake with a double harte psalm that is to speake against knowledge and conscience as when a man saith that is true which he knowes to be false or that is false which he knowes to be true this makes a lie to be a lie and this distinguisheth an vntruth from a lie for here it must be obserued that a man may speake that which is false and not lie namely if he speake that which is false thinking it to be true for then though he erre and is deceiued yet he speakes not against conscience and consequently he speakes no lie againe a man may speake that which is true and yet lie for if he speake that which is true indeede and speake it as a trueth and yet thinke it to be false he lies indeed because he speakes the truth against his conscience the third thing in a lie is a minde or intention to deceiue or hurte for in the ninth commandement that is a false testimonie that is against our neighbour the pointe is that he which speakes that which is false vpon a vanitie of minde without reasonable cause is a lier thus bosters amp flatterers are liers and these are the things which concurre in the making of a lie for the better conceiuing of the nature of a lie we must put difference between it and sundrie other things incident to speach first we must put difference betwene a lie and a parable or figure in a parable indeed there is something supposed or fained as for example when the trees are brought in conferring and consulting aboute their king iud neuerthelesse a parable is farre from falsehoode or lying for by things fained it signifies and declares an vnfained truth againe difference must be put betwene a lie and the concealement of a thing for it is one thing to speake against our knowledge and another to speake that which we knowe and concealements if there be a reasonable cause and if it be not necessary for vs to reueale the thing concealed are not unlawful thus abraham speakes the truth in parte calling sara his sister and conceales it in part not confessing her to be his wife gen thus samuel by god appointment reueales that he came to gilgall to offer sacrifice and conceales the annointment of dauid that he might saue his life sam ionas preaches that niniue shall be destroyed within daies and he conceales the condition of repentance the like did isaie to ezechias isa thirdly a difference must be made between lying and fayning which some call simulation not dissembling but rather sembling if i may so terme it and that is when something is spoken not contrary but beside or diverse to that which we thinke and this kind of fayning if it be not to the preiudice of truth against the glory of god and the good of our neighbour amp haue some conuenient and reasonable cause is not unlawful it was not the will and counsell of god to destroy the israelites for their idolatry and he doth not speake vnto moses any thing contrary to his will but something that is beside or diverse vnto it when he saith let me alone that my wrath may waxe ho and i may destroy them exod and this he spake that he might stirre vp moses to feruencie in praier for the israelites and the israelites to vnfained repentance iosua hauing besiged ai meant not to flie yet doth lie faine a flight that he might draw his enemy out of the citie amp destroy the ios there is a kind of deceit called dolus bonus that is a good deceit and of this kind was the act of iosua thus physitians for their good vse to deceiue the senses of their impotent patients thus parets insinuate vnto their childre terrible things of the beare and bull begger that they may keepe them from places of hurt and danger and this may be done without fault for it is one thing to contrary the truth and an other to speake or doe something diverse vnto it without contrariety the second point is whether to lie be a sinne or no the answer is yes for euen in this place paul puts lying from himselfe and that with an oath the deuill is said to be the author of all lies ioh and it is god commandement that we should put away lying ephesians it is obiected that the sporting and officious lie is not against charitie to the hurt of any but for the good of man i answer first though it be not to the hurt of our neighbour yet is it to the hurt and preiudice of trueth secondly they are deceiued to whom these lies are told thirdly he hurts himselfe that tels a lie though it be for the good of man for when he speakes the truth indeede he is lesse beleeued lastly though these kind of lies seeme to be good in respect of their ende yet are they not good in respect of their nature and constitution for in speaking there should be a conformitie and consent betweene the tongue and the minde which is not when any lie is vttered secondly it is obiected that the egyptian midwiues saued the male children of the israelites and rahab the spies by lying exod ios and that they are commended for this i answer we must distinguish the worke done from the ex equution of the worke the worke in sauing the children and the spies was a fruite of faith and the feare of god and it is comended but the manner of putting these workes in exequution by lying is not approoued if it be said that faith and the feare of god cannot stand with a manifest sinne i say againe that faith and the feare of god are imperfect in this life and therefore they are ioyned with many frailties and actions of faith are mixed with sundrie defects and sinnes now then we are to be exhorted to make a conscience of lying and to speake the trueth from our hearts and there be many reasons to induce vs to the practise of this dutie first it is god commandement iam secondly lying is a conformitie to the deuill and by truth we are made conformable to god who is truth it selfe thirdly we are sanctified by the word of truth ioh and guided by the spirit of truth and therefore we are to detest lying and deceit fourthly truth is a fruit of god spirit gal and a marke of god child psalm v he hath the pardon of his sinnes in whose spirit there is no guile and psalm he shall rest in the mountaine of god who speakes the truth from his heart lastly destruction is the lyers reward psalm god will destroy them that speake lies and they must haue their portion in the lake that burnes with fire and brimstone revelation thus much of the answer to the obiection now followes the confirmation by oath before god here it may be demanded how these words can be a forme of swearing ans in an oath there be foure things the first is an asseveration of the truth the second is cenfession whereby the partie that is to sweare acknowledgeth the power presence and wisdome of god in searching the heart and that he is both witnes amp iudge of all our doings the third is invocation of god that he would be a witnesse with vs and to vs that we speake the truth the last is imprecation that god would be a iudge to take reuenge vpon vs if we lie now then the forme of an oath is a certen forme of wordes in which not all but some of the principall parts of an oath are expressed and the rest concealed and yet to be vnderstood ierem there is the forme of an oath the lord liueth and here onely confession is expressed the forme of swearing i call god to witnesse to my soule corinthian expresseth the third part namely inuocation the words ruth the lord doe thus and thus vnto me is an imprecation the common forme the lord thee helpe through iesus christ is partly praier and partly imprecation and the forme in this place is directly a confession that god is present to witnes and iudge the truth thus commonly in all formes of oaths one part is expressed and the rest are infolded here first we learne that the forme of an oath is to be plaine and direct in the name of god and not indirect or oblique in the name of the creatures god name concealed and it is the flat commandement of god math it is alleadged that paul corinthian sweares by his reioycing in christ i answer the words of paul by my reioycing are not an oath but an obtestation for the meaning of his wordes is this that his sorrowes and afflictions which he indured for christ would testifie if they could speake that he died daily thus moses called heauen and earth to witnes without swearing for in an oath the thing by which he sweares is made not onely witnes but also iudge neuerthelesse it is not unlawful to name the creatures in the forme of an oath if they be considered as pledges presented vnto god that he should punish vs in them if we lie thus paul sweareth i call god to witnes to or vpon my soule here they are to be blamed whose common fwearing is by the creatures as by their faith by their troth by the masse marie by this bread by this drinke ampc secondly here we learne to vse an oath onely in the case of extremitie namely when a necessarie truth is to be confirmed amp whe this cannot be don by any reason or proofe to be foud among man vpon earth then may we flie vnto heauen for proofe and make god our witnes thus paul confirmes his owne calling when all other proofes failed and it must further be obserued that in extremities he vseth an oath but seldome this seemes to condemne their wickednes that crie at euery word in their common talke before god before god thirdly before we sweare we are to vse great meditation consideration and preparation and therefore paul in swearing vseth a word of attention and saith behold i speake it before god this condemnes the rash and customable swearing of man in their common talke who also in that they commonly and rashly sweare commonly forsweare themselues in that paul confirmes his writings by oath it appeares that they are of god for if he had sworne falsly god would haue taken reuenge vpon him and his writings before this which he hath not done whereas paul saith before god i speake it he teacheth vs after his owne example to bring our selues into the presence of god to walke before him as enoch did gen and as abraham was commanded gen and to doe whatsoeuer we doe as in the sight and presence of god and to be afraid to sinne because of his presence this is the true feare of god and this is the right practise of religion after that i went into the coasts of syria and cilicia and i was vnknowne by face to the churches of iudea which were in christ but they had heard onely some say he which persequuted vs in times past now preacheth the faith which before he destroied and they glorified god in me here paul answers an other obiection which may be framed thus though paul learned not the gospel of the apostles at ierusalem yet might he happily learne it of them in other churches of iudea to this paul answers three things the first is that he went from ierusalem into syria and cilicia the second that he was not knowne in person to the churches of iudea but onely by hearsay and he sets downe the report that went of him the third is that the churches of iudea did not disgrace and slander him but they glorified god for him of these in order for the first that paul went from ierusalem straight into syria and cilicia the regions of the gentiles there be two causes one because paul was ordained specially to be the apostle of the gentiles act rom the second because cilicia was his owne countrey for he was borne in tarsus a towne in cilicia and his loue to his countrey no doubt was great for in the like case he could haue wished himselfe to be accursed for his countrimen the iewes from this first answer i gather two things first if any apostle aboue the rest be the pastour and vniuersall bishop of the church ouer the whole world it is paul and not peter because he specially was ordained to teach and conuert the nation the second is that pauls often and daungerous iourneies must teach vs to attend on our callings with care and diligence and not to be dismaied with the troubles that shall befall vs the second answer that paul was knowne to the christian iewes not by face but by hearsay this may seeme strange considering paul was at ierusalem and trauailed through iurie into syria and cilicia but it is the truth and the reason of it is plaine the office of an apostle is not to build vpon the foudation of an other or to succeede any man in his labours but to plant and found the church of the new testament where christ had not bin preached or named rom in this the apostles differ from all the ministers of the new testament whatsoeuer and this is the cause why paul was not knowne to the churches of iudea and here we see that succession which the papists magnifie is not alwaies a note of the true church and the true ministerie for the ministerie of the apostles and the apostolicall churches wanted it and this is for the greater commendation of them againe it is said that paul was not knowne to the churches of iudea which were in christ where let it be obserued that yeares after the ascension of christ the apostles had gathered and planted sundrie christian churches in iudea this greatly commends the efficacie and power of the gospel for hardnes of heart had ouerspread the nation of the iewes and they had reiected and crucified the lord of life and thus that is verified which christ saith that his disciples beleeuing in him should doe greater things then he had done ioh for he by preaching did not conuert multitudes of the iewes and range them into churches as the apostles did here againe we see that the gospel by means of the corruption of man is an occasion of diuisions for after the gospel was preached by the apostles there arose a diuision of churches among the iewes some were churches in christ and some out of christ namely the synagogues which refused christ we may not therfore nowe a daies take offence if schismes and dissentions followe where the gospel is preached it is not the fault of the gospel it is the fault of man that paul might the better shewe that he was known to the churches of the iewes onely by heare say he expresses the report that went of him hence i gather it is not unlawful to tell and heare reports or newes so be it they be not to the preiudice of the trueth of the glory of god and the good name of man nay it is commendable to report and heare newes that concernes the increase of god kingdome and the conuersion of wicked man in the report two things are set downe what paul did he once persecuted vs and destroyed the faith what he now doth he preacheth the gospel by this we see that verified which isai foretold that the lyon the wolfe the lambe ampc should peaceably liue togither againe here we see that all things vpon earth are subiect to change and alteration so as it may be said heretefore it was thus and thus but nowe it is otherwise therefore in miseries we may not be ouer much grieued for they are changeable and in earthly things we may not reioyce ouer much because they are mutable and subiect to daily alterations our speciall care must be to auoide eternall and vnchangeable euils as death and the cause of death namely sinne and to purchase to our selues the good things which are euerlasting namely the fauour of god and euerlasting life furthermore the thing which paul aimed at in persequuting the church is to be considered and that was that he might destroy the faith by faith we are to vnderstand the doctrine of the gospel and with all the vertue or gift of faith whereby it is beleeued for the deuill amp his instruments seeke the ouerthrow of both christ saith satan desired to sift his disciples that is to sift all their faith out of their hearts and to leaue nothing in the but chaffe luke here then it may be demanded whether faith may be lost specially in the children of god in the time of temptation and persecution i answer thus there be three degrees of faith the first consists in two things knowledge of the gospel and assent to the trueth of it this faith the devil haue and it may be lost and beleeuers by this faith may quite fall away the second kind of faith containes knowledge assent a taste or ioy in the goodnesse of god a zeale to the word of god and apparent fruits of holinesse this faith also beeing better then the former may be lost in the daies of persecution and beleeuers by this faith may fall quite away luke the third faith called the faith of the elect containes three parts knowledge of the gospel assent to the trueth of it and apprehension whereby we doe receiue and apply christ with his benefits to our selues or the promise of remission of sinnes and life euerlasting this faith may be greatly wasted for things appertaining to it may be lost as boldnesse to come vnto god the sense or feeling of spiritual ioy and such like againe it may be buried for a time in the heart and not shew it selfe either by fruits or any profession and in respect of the measure of it it may be lessened and maimed and if we respect the nature of it it is as apt to be lost as any other grace of god for there is nothing by nature vnchangeable but god neuerthelesse where this faith is in trueth it is neuer by affliction and temptation put out or exstingnished because god in mercie confirms it by newe grace christ saith to peter i haue prayed for thee that thy faith faile not luke and this priuiledge haue all the godly for god promiseth that they shall not be tempted aboue their strength corinthian indeede persecutors are said to destroy the faith because this is their intent and they indeauour to doe what they can but god preuents their desires by establishing true faith that it may not vtterly faile it may be obiected to the contrarie on this manner the child of god may fa l into persecution and denie christ by this fall he is guiltie of a grieuous offence beeing guiltie he hath not pardon of his offence and beeing without pardon he is without faith touching guiltinesse i answer thus the child of god when he falls is indeed guiltie but howe guiltie in respect of himselfe or as much as in him lies because he hath done that which is worthy of death and he hath done all he can to make himselfe guiltie but he is not guiltie to condemnation because god on his part doeth not breake off the purpose of adoption and adiudge him to wrath secondly touching the pardon of his offence i answer thus in pardon there be foure degrees the degree of pardon before all worlds the promise of pardon in the beginning of the worde the seed of the woman ampc the procurement of pardon vpon the crosse and the donation or the giuing of the pardon this donation is an action of god whereby he giues and communicates christ vnto vs and applies to our consciences the remission of our sinnes in this donation there is required a hand to giue and a hand to receiue the hand of god whereby he giues is the word preached and the sacraments the hand to receiue is our faith the giuing of pardon is necessarie for though sinnes be pardoned in the decree of god by his promise in the word and by procurement vpon the crosse yet pardon is no pardon to vs till it be giuen vnto vs by god furthermore this giuing is not altogether at one instant but it beginnes in the conuersion of a sinner and is often iterated in the vse of the word and sacraments to the death paul wils the corinthians reconciled to god still to be reconciled corinthian and we are taught euery day to pray to god to giue vs the pardon of our sinnes this giuing is twofold conditionall and absolute conditionall when god giues the pardon of sinne vpon condition thus in baptisme and in the first conuersion of a sinner all sinnes without exception are pardoned yes future sinnes yet not simply whether a man repent or no but vpon condition of future repentance the absolute donation is when a man repents or renewes his repentance for then the pardon of sinne is simply and fully without condition applied and reuealed to the conscience when dauid confessed his sin nathan in the name of the lord saith thy sinne is forgiuen thee sam now then to come to the point the child of god hath pardon of his fall in respect of the decree to pardon in respect of the generall promise of pardon in respect of the procurement of pardon in respect of the conditionall donation of pardon which is made in baptisme and he may be said to want pardon in that the pardon of his offence is not fully and absolutely giuen him till he recouer himselfe and renewe his repentance if it be here demaunded what the childe of god askes when he praies for pardon day by day i answer he praies for two things first that god would continue to shew his fauour and to impute the merits of christ vnto him wheras he for his part by his offence deserues to be depriued of all fauour secondly he asks the giuing of the pardon that is that god would certifie his conscience thereof the vse seeing the intent of the deuill and wicked man is to destroy the saith as it appeares in this place and in the first temptation wherewith satan assaulted christ math we must haue a speciall care of our faith and first we must looke that our faith be a true faith least we be dece ued as the foolish virgin secondly we must keepe and locke vp our faith in some safe and sure place namely in the store house or treasurie of a good conscience tim thirdly our care must be to increase in faith that our hearts may be rooted and grounded in the loue of god and for this cause we are to make continuall experiences and obseruations of the loue of god toward vs and to laie them all together and to build a ioyfull conclusion therevpon the third answer of paul is and they glorified god for mee that is the churches of iudea when they heard of my calling amp conuersion they considered therein the power the goodnes and the mercie of god and with ioy they gaue him thankes for it in this practise of the church we learne that our dutie is to sanctifie amp glorifie the name of god in euery worke of his and this sanctification hath partes the first is the consideration of the diuine vertues that shew themselues in euery worke of god as his wisdome power iustice mercie prouidence presence ampc the second is praise and thanks giuing to god for the same and this practise must be inlarged to all his workes without exception to his iudgements as well as to his workes of mercie therefore we are commaunded in persequution to sanctifie god in our hearts pet and moses because he failed in the doing of this duty was barred the land of canaan number in england god hath wrought his wonderous workes among vs he hath giuen vs peace and protection against our enemy with the gospell for the space of yeares and more and our dutie is to glorifie god in these workes of his but alas we doe it not for the gospell of saluation is little regarded of the most and little obedience is yeelded to it this neglect of ours in glorifying amp praising of god is a great sinne and it standes vs in hand to repent of it betime least god take away his word from vs and leaue vs to strange illusions to beleeue lies again here we see what is the right maner of honouring of the saints and that is to glorifie god in them and for them as for religious worship of adoration and inuocation it is proper to god and the saints desire it not revelation then yeares after i went vp againe to ierusalem with barnabas and tooke with me titus also and i went by reuelation and communicated with the of the gospel which i preach amog the gentiles but priuately with them that were the chiefe least by any meanes i should runne or had runne in vaine in this chapter paul proceedes to iustifie and defend his immediate amp extraordinarie calling and this whole chapter seemes to depend on the last wordes of the former chapter against which the aduersaries of paul might happily obiect on this manner though the churches of iudea glorifie god for thee yet will not the apostles doe it because thou teachest otherwise then they teach to this obiection paul makes a double answer in this chapter the effect and summe of the first is this i went vp to ierusalem i conferred with the apostles there i had their consent and approbation and the answer containes three parts the first of pauls iourney to ierusalem in the first verse the second of his conference with the apostles in the verse the third of the approbation which they gaue him from the v to the eleuenth in his iourney i consider foure things the first is the manner of his iourneying in these wordes i went vp or ascended to ierusalem and this he speakes because ierusalem was placed and seated vpon a mountaine and compassed with moutaines psalm or againe in respect of the dignitie and excellencie of the place as we in england are said to goe vp to london from all the parts of the land because it is the cheife citie the second thing to be considered in the iourney is the time when in these words then after fourteene yeares here two questions are to be demaunded the first is of which of his iourneies must this be vnderstood for he made fiue iournies to ierusalem the first from arabia the second when he and barnabas were sent by the church of the gentiles to carrie almes to ierusalem the third when he went to the councell at ierusalem the fourth when he went vp for the keeping of his vowe the last is mentioned act answer these words are not spoken of the first for that was but three yeares after his conuersion neither can they well be vnderstood of the second because paul then was sent by the church and therefore he went not by reuelation and they cannot well be vnderstood of the third for then paul would here haue mentioned the councell of ierusalem whereof he was a principall member specially seeing he hath occasion so to doe and it serued much for his purpose the fourth amp fifth iourneys were after a longer time then fourteene yeares it is likely therefore that this iourney here mentioned and described by paul is none of the fiue mentioned by luke but some other the second question is when these fourteene yeares must beginne ans it is vncerten some thinke they must beginne at his conuersion some three yeares after when paul went first to ierusalem and either may be a truth none must here take offece for though circumstances of time and place beeing things of lesse moment cannot alwaies be certenly gathered yet history for their substance and doctrines pertaining to saluation are plainly set downe and here we are put in minde to be content to be ignorant in some things because the spirit of god hath more darkly expressed them or againe because we cannot by reason of our blindnes gather them the third point is concerning the companions of paul in this iourney namely barnabas and titus and paul takes them with him that they might be witnesses to the iewes of the doctrine he taught among the gentiles and againe to the gentiles of the consent that was betweene him and the rest of the apostles for the law of god is that euery matter shall be established by the testimonie of two or three witnesses hence we learne that if a question arise of the doctrine which is deliuered in the publike ministerie then the hearers that are able to iudge must be witnesses and the triall is to be made by them thus saith christ in the like case why aske ye me aske them that heard me ioh therefore great care and circumspection is to be had of things publikely deliuered againe whereas paul makes barnabas a iew and titus a gentile his companions we are taught to imbrace with a brotherly loue not onely the man of our owne countrey but also such as be of other nation specially if they beleeue for then they are all children of one father and pertaine all to one familie and there is no difference of nation now it is a fault therefore that man of one nation carrie in their hearts a generall dislike and hatred oftentimes of them with whome they deale and conuerse and that because they are of such or such country the fourth point is the cause of his iourney in these words and i went by reuelation here we are taught that for the iournies we make we are to haue some good and sufficient warrant though not a reuelation yet a commandement or that which counteruailes a commandement as when we trauaile by vertue of our callings when noe had made the arke he enters into it at god commandement he abides in it and when the earth was in part dried he presumes not to goe out till the lord bad him here three sorts of man are to be blamed pilgrimes that trauell to ierusalem or other country in way of merit or religion for they haue no warrant secondly trauellers that goe from countrey to countrey and out of the precincts of the church vpon vaine curiositie to see fashions such when they trauell from their own country yet they trauell not from their vices but rather goe deeper into them and come home againe with many bad and corrupt fashions the last are beggers amp rogues that passe from place to place that they mayl ue in idlenes amp vpo the sweat of other mens brows thus much of the iourney now followes the conference in these words and i communicated ampc here generally i gather that conferences both priuate and publike are laudible and to be maintained specially when they tend to the maintenance of vni ie and consent in doctrine the papists blame vs protestant for condemning conferences as they say and councells but they doe vs wrong indeede the councell of trent we reiect and condemne for in it against all equitie the pope was both partie and iudge in it there was no libertie to make triall of truth for nothing was propounded but by the liking and consent of the pope againe the whole councell consisted of such as were of the italian faction whose faith was pinned on the popes sleeue neuerthelesse we allow all christian councells lawfully gathered and we desire there might be a generall councell for the triall of truth and for the staying of vnsetled minds these three caueats beeing remembred one that the councell be gathered by christian princes to whom the right of calling a councell belongs the other that the pope be no iudge but a partie the third that christ in his word be the iudge and that the delegates in the councell be but as witnesses determining all things by the written word in this conference we are first to consider the manner of conferring which was vsed paul saith he communicated with them that is he laid downe vnto them and expounded the gospel which he preached and this he did priuatly that is with the apostles one by one in plaine and familiar manner as one friend doth with an other therefore for the maintaining of this conference there was no assembly made neither was there any disputation held onely paul declares his doctrine and they giue assent hence it appeares that paul doth not submit the truth of his doctrine to triall for he was resolued of it and he accursed him that taught otherwise but his intent was to seeke the approbation of the apostles that he might stop the mouth of his aduersaries the second point is the matter of the conference and that is the gospel which paul preached here the papist gathereth that the church is the iudge in all questions pertaining to religion and the word because it is here the thing that is iudged i answer first that they gather amisse for paul doeth not here submit the gospel which he preached to the iudgement of the church of ierusalem and it is false which they teach for the soueraigne iudge of all questions and controuersies in religion is christ alone the power to determine and resolue in cases concerning faith and good life is inseperably annexed to his person and in it are we to rest the principall voice of the iudge and the definitiue sentence is the written word and the office of the church is no more but to gather declare testifie and pronounce this sentence it is obiected that when a question is propounded the scripture cannot speake nor christ in the scripture but the church onely i answer againe that god ascribes to the written word a voice or speech rom and the scripture speakes sufficiently to the resoluing of any mans conscience in all matters pertayning to saluation again they alleadge that the church is before the scripture and therfore it beeing most auncient must be the iudge i answer that the church was before the writing of the word but not before the word which is written for the church presupposeth faith and faith presupposeth a word of god vpon this our doctrine they further vpbraid vs that we wil be tried by nothing but by the scriptures euen as the malefactour that will not be tried by the quest but by the euidence i answer for the satisfying of our aduersaries we submit our selues to the triall of the church and councels so be it the three cautions before remebred be duly obserued specially that all things be iudged and tried by the written word and by reasons gathered thence againe the papists hence gather that the scriptures are to be approoued by the church ans thus much we graunt yet so as we hold that the principal approbatio of the word wherby we are mooued to beleeue and obey is in the word amp fro the word and not from the church for the scripture hath his euidence within itselfe which is sufficient to make vs beleeue the word to be the word though the church should say nothing the third point is concerning the persons with whome paul conferred namely with them that were the cheife that is with them that were in price and account as peter iames ampc here we see what is the honour and worshippe that is due to excellent man namely a pretious and reuerend estimation thus the name of dauid was in price in israel for his vertues sam last and thus with the papists are we content to honour the saints again here the papists gather that they are hereticks that after pauls example will not go vp to rome to peter and his successour to haue their doctrine and religion tried and examined i answer first we are content to be tried by the writings of peter iames john paul ampc and this is the commandement of god in doubtfull cases to the law and the testimonie isai secondly i answer that we haue a commandement not to goe vp to rome at this day to haue our religion tried revelation come out of babylon my people thirdly i answer that the bishop of rome is peters successour not in teaching but in denying christ and the learned papists confesse that for this succession they haue but a humane faith grounded vpon humane historie the fourth point is the ende of the conference least i should runne that is least i should preach or had preached in vaine these words of paul are not simply to be taken for the ministerie of man and euery sermon brings forth the fruite which god hath appointed and whether it be vnto the hearers the sauour of life or the sauour of death it is alwaies a sweet sauour vnto god the words therefore carrie this meaning least my preaching should be of lesse vse and profit or againe least i should preach in vaine in respect of that good which is looked for at the hands of an apostle and this paul speakes because a rumor went abroad that his doctrine in many things was contrarie to the other apostles and by this meanes many were kept from receiuing the gospell and the faith of weake beleeuers was quenched now then the ende of the conference was to stay this false report that the ministerie of paul might haue passage and that with greater profit hence the papists gather that the doctrine of paul was vncerten and vnprofitable till it was approoued by peter i answer that paul sought the approbation of his doctrine at the hands of peter and the rest not because it was vncerten and vnprofitable but because it was slaundered and the slaunder was that he taught otherwise then peter did nowe to cut off this slander he vseth meanes to manifest his consent with peter and therefore seekes approbation at his hand againe when paul saith least i should runne in vaine he giues vs to vnderstand that the ministerie of the word is not a worke of ease or pleasure but a labour nay a continued labour like to the running in a race it were therefore to be wished that ministers of the gospel would so labour and walke in this calling that they might be able to say with paul i haue fought a good fight i haue finished my course ampc tim thirdly hence it appeares that all beleeuers should haue a certen knowledge of their faith and religion the procuring of this was the thing that paul aimed at in this conference with the apostles at ierusalem we must not be as children carried away with euery winde of doctrine ephesians god word requires faith in vs and faith presupposeth certen knowledge the first and second commandements require that we knowe god and his will distinguish him from false god and his worshippe from false worshippe here comes the fault of our times to be considered most man among vs doe not knowe their religion neither can they distinguish it from errour and false religion a foule negligence we take paines to learne trade and occupations that we may haue wherewith to preserue this temporall life what a shame then is it that we learne not better to know the doctrine of true religion whereby our soules are to be saued lastly here we learne that the office of the minister is not onely to teach and preach but also to studie and take care howe by preaching he may doe the most good but neither yet titus which was with me though he were a greek was compelled to be circumcised after the conference followes the approbation which was giuen to paul it stands in foure things the first that the apostles did not compell titus to be circumcised v the second that they added nothing to his doctrine v the third that they gaue him the hands of fellowship v the laste that at his departure they required of him nothing but the giuing of almes v for the first the words and titus was not compelled to be circumcised carrie this sense i for my part was readie to circumcise titus if there had beene a meete occasion false brother would haue imposed a necessitie vpon vs then i and titus refused and the apostles did not vrge me to circumcise him here it may be demanded howe this text can well stand with act v for there paul circumciseth timothie a greek and here he refuseth to circumcise titus though he were a greek i answer thus circumcision was at this time a thing indifferent from the first institution to the comming and specially to the death of christ it was a thing commanded a sacrament and a part of god worship againe after the plant of the church of the newe testament it was vtterly abolished and a thing in respect of vse vtterly unlawful in the middle time that is while the gospel was in publishing to the world and the church of the newe testament was yet in founding it was a ceremonie free or indifferent it may be obiected that the whole ceremoniall law was abolished in the death of christ i answer it was so and circumcision was abolished in respect of faith and conscience yet so as the vse therof was left to the libertie of the people of god for a while circumcision at this time was as a corps that is dead yet vnburied and onely laid out and so it must remaine for a time that it may be buried with honour it may againe be obiected that baptisme was come in the roome of circumcision and that therefore circumcision was but an idle and emptie ceremonie i answer it was not vsed as a sacrament at this time or as a part of god worship or as a matter of necessitie but onely as a free ceremonie and that onely then when it tended to the edification of man beeing then a thing indifferent it might as occasion serued be vsed or not vsed therefore paul condescending to the weaknes of the beleeuing iewes circumcised timothie and that he might not offend the godly and hinder christian libertie he refused to circumcise titus here a great question is answered whether we may vse things indifferent as oft as we will and howe we will the answer is no things are not called indifferent because we may vse them indifferently or not vse them when we will and how we will but because in themselues or in their owne nature they are neither good nor euill and we may vse them well or ill amp we may againe not vse them well or euill furthermore there be two things which restraine the vse of things indifferent the lawe of charitie and the lawes of man the lawe of charitie is this things indifferent in the case of scandall cease to be indifferent and are as things morall that is either forbidden or commanded paul saith if to eate flesh be to the offence of his brother he will eate no flesh while the world stands corinthian and though he circumcised timothie yet would he not circumcise titus least he should offend the godly and by his example hurt christian libertie likewise the good lawes of man whether ciuill or ecclesiasticall tending to the common good and seruing for edification restraine the vse of things indifferent so that they which shall doe otherwise then these lawes command with a contemptuous or disloyall minde are guiltie before god yet here two cautions must be remembred one that the lawes of man doe not chaunge the nature of things indifferent for it is the propertie of god by willing this or that to make it good or euill neither doe they take away the vse of things indifferent for libertie graunted by a soueraigne power cannot be reuersed by an inferiour power therefore humane lawes doe no more but temper and moderate the ouer common vse of things indifferent the second caution is that when the ende of a law ceaseth when there is no contempt of the authoritie that made the law when no offence is giuen a thing indifferent remaines in his free vse without sinne or breach of conscience againe here we learne that a thing indifferent when it is made necessarie to saluation as circumcision was is not to be vsed this conclusion serues to ouerthrow the popish religion for it stands in the obseruation of things indifferent as meates drinkes apparell times ampc and the vsing or the not vsing of them is made necessarie euen in regard of mans saluation for the abstinence from things that are by nature indifferent is made a part of god worship and meritorious of eternall life for example to marrie or not to marrie is for nature a thing indifferent and therefore when abstinence from marriage is made necessarie as it is in diverse orders of man and woman the nature of the thing is changed which god hath left free and it is a doctrine of deuills which is taught here againe we learne to make difference of persons some are weake some are obstinate weake ones are such as hauing turned vnto god and carrying in their hearts a purpose in all things to please god neuerthelesse doe sundrie things amisse vpon simple ignorance or badde custome till they be better informed of these paul saith that he became all to all that he might saue some corinthian and for their sakes he condescended to circumcise timothie and if we that haue scarce a drop of mercie in vs must thus beare with them that are weake much more will god doe it who is mercie it selfe the good shepheard brings home the stray sheepe vpon his shoulders he carries his lambs in his bosome isa he will not quench the smoaking flaxe isa he spares them that feare him as a father spares his child malach this beeing alwaies remembred that weake ones truly turne to god and carrie in their hearts an honest purpose not to sinne against his lawes at any time wittingly and willingly obstinate persons are such as professe the faith and yet hold and practise bad things of wilfull ignorance and of malice these persons are not to be borne with nor to be respected and in respect of them paul would not circumcise titus lastly in that titus was not compelled to be circumcised it may be demanded whether recusants may be compelled to the exercises of religion i answer yes for exercises of religion are not things indifferent as circumcision was iosias made a couenant with the lord and he caused all his subiects to stand to it chronicle the king at the marriage feast of his son saith of the guests compell them to enter in luke it is obiected that man may not be compelled to beleeue i answer it is the commandement of god prooue the spirits ioh and this commandement pertaines to all persons therfore though man may not be compelled to beleeue yet may they be compelled to come to the congregation to heare our sermons and therein the reasons and grounds of our doctrine that they may trie what is the truth and cleaue vnto it for this is their dutie for all the false brother that crept in who came in priuily to spie out our liberite which we haue in christ iesus that they might bring vs into bondage to whome we gaue not place by subiection for an houre that the truth of the gospel might continue with you paul had said before that titus was not compelled to be circumcised now he addes for all the false brother that is though the false brother did what they could to the contrarie here then paul sets downe who were the cause that titus was not circumcised namely certaine persons at ierusalem and them he sets forth by two properties they are false brother and they crept into the church touching the first by it we learne that the church of god vpon earth euen when it is at the best hath wicked man and hypocrites in it in adams family there is cain in the arke there is cham in christs family or schoole there is iudas in the church of ierusalem planted and gouerned by the chiefe apostles there be false brother the true sheepe be often without and wolues within therefore we may not so much as dreame of a perfection of the church of god vpon earth so long as wicked man be mixed with true beleeuers againe these aduersaries of paul are called false brother because they ioyned circumcision with christ as a necessarie cause of iustification and saluation hence it followes that the church of rome is a false church because it ioynes workes with christ in the case of our iustification and that as meritorious causes their second propertie is that they crept into the church which i conceiue on this manner the church of god is as a sheepefold or house ioh christ is the onely dore now pastours that teach christ aright are saide to enter in by this dore they which teach any other way of saluation are said to clime in an other way and they which teach christ ioyning some other thing with him in the cause of saluation are said to creepe in because in appearance they maintaine christ and yet because they adde something to christ they neither enter nor continue in the true church with any good warrant from god in this they are like the serpent liuing creatures were all placed in eden and man was placed in the garden of eden called paradise and so were not beast how then comes the serpent in why in all likelihood it crept in and so doe false brother into the church hence i gather that false brother are not true and liuely members of the visible church though they be members in appearance for if they were in their right place they should not be said to creepe in the true members of the church creepe not into the mysticall bodie but are built and set vpon the foundation by god it may be alleadged that they are baptised and thereby made members of the church i answer that faith makes vs members of christ and consequently of the true church and baptisme doth but seale our insition into christ and serues as a meanes of admission into the outward societie of the congregation and the outward washing doth not make any man a member of christ againe it followes hence that false brother are not members of the catholike church for the visible church is part of the catholike and therefore they which are not reall members of the true visible church are not members of the catholike againe in that false brother creepe into the congregation hence it appeares that no man can set downe the precise time when errours had their beginning for the authors thereof enter in secretly not obserued of man the enuious man sowes his tares when man be asleepe math it sufficeth therefore if we can shew them to be errours by the word though we cannot designe the set time when they began the time when a shippe sinketh we often obserue but the time when it first drew water we doe not let the papists thinke vpon this paul hauing thus declared who were the causes that titus was not circumcised goes on and shewes how they were causes the effect and summe of his declaration is this they vrged the obseruation of the ceremoniall law as necessarie and hereupon we resused to circumcise titus first therefore paul sets downe how they vrged circumcision and that by three degrees first they come in priuily secondly they spie out their libertie thirdly they labour to bring them into bondage againe paul sets downe the manner of their refusall in three things we gaue not place for an houre we gaue not place by subiection we gaue no place that the truth of the gospel might continue with you the first degree or steppe in their vrging of circumcision was that they came in priuily that is they ioyned themselues in fellowship with the apostles amp in shew pretended the furtherance of the gospel amp yet indeed meant nothing lesse though their fraud amp wickednes was not perceiued here then the foudation they lay of all their naughtie dealing is their dissebling which paul here notes amp condemns on the contrarie our dutie is to be indeed that which we professe our selues to be amp to professe no more outwardly then we are inwardly and to approue our hearts to god for that which we professe before me the second steppe or degree is that they spie out the libertie vvhich paul and the rest had by christ that is they conferre with the apostles and inquire of them what libertie they haue by christ in respect of the ceremoniall lawe of god and this they doe not of a minde desirous to learne but for aduantage sake there be two kinds of spying one lawefull the other vnlawefull lawefull as when in iust and lawefull war we inquire into the counsells and doings of our enemtes numb vnlawefull when man prie into any thing or matter to finde a fault thus hypocrites spie faults in the persons and liues of man that they may haue somwhat whereby to disgrace them math thus atheists prie into the scriptures that they may confute them thus sundrie hearers come to sermos that they may carpe thus our enemy inquire into our religion that they may finde as they suppose exceptions vntruthes and contradictions and in the church of ierusalem false brother inquire how farre christian liberty extends that they may ouerthrow it this kind of spying is a common fault we must take heede of it and apply the eie of our minde to a better vse first we are to be spies in respect of our owne sinnes and corruptions to spie them out lam let us search our waies and inquire and turne againe to the lord again we are to plaie the spies in respect of our spirituall enemy that we may finde out the temptations of the flesh the world and the deuill thirdly we must be as spies in searching of the scriptures ioh that we may vnderstand the words of the lawe of god and find comfort to our soules the third and last degree of vrging is that the false brother seeke to bring the apostles in bondage that is to binde them to a necessarie obseruation of the ceremoniall lawe here let vs marke the practise and pollicie of the deuill libertie from sinne death and the ceremoniall lawe is the treasure of the church and therefore the deuill seekes to ouerthrow it by holding man in bondage vnder abolished ceremonies thus at this day they of the popish church are in bondage vnder an heape of humane traditions beeing indeede a yoake farre heauier then that of the ceremoniall lawe againe when man professe the name of christ the deuill is content with it and he indeauours with all his might euery where to hold them vnder the bondage of sinne and to hold them in his snare at his will thus vnder the name of christianitie there be swarmes of atheists epicures libertines worldlings and prophane persons at this time according to auncient custome we celebrate the memoriall of the birth of christ and yet no time so full of disorder as this for the most that professe christ take and challenge to themselues a licentious libertie to liue and doe as they list and this kind of libertie is flat bondage but they that are servant of christ indeed should take heede of this bondag for beeing free from sinne they should be servant of nothing but righteousnesse rom they that be of a corporation stand for their liberties what a shame then is it that man should loue bondage and neglect the spirituall libertie which they haue by christ thus we see howe the false brother vrged circumcision now let vs come to pauls refusall the first point is that they would not giue place for an houre it seemes they were requested to vse circumcision but once but they would not yeeld so much as once because their acte would haue tended to the preiudice of christian liberty in all places here we learne that we may not vse the least ceremonie that is in the case of confession before our aduersaries that is when they seeke to oppresse the trueth by face or by fraud and make ceremonies signes and tokens of the confession of any vntrueth iulian the emperour sitting in a chaire of estate gaue gold to his souldiers one by one withal comading to cast of frakincense so much as a graine into the fire that lay vpon an heathenish altar before him nowe christ in souldiers refuse to do it and they which had not refused afterward recalled their acte and willingly suffered death againe here we learne that we are not to yeeld from the least part of the trueth of the gospel that god hath reuealed to vs this truth is more pretious then the whole world beside and heauen and earth shall rather passe then the least tittle of it shall not be accomplished the commission of the apostles was to teach them to doe all things which god had commanded therefore the vnion or mixture of our religion with the popish religion is but a dreame of vnwise politickes for in this mixture we must yeeld and they must yeeld something but we may not yeeld a iot of the truth reuealed to vs there is no fellowship of light with darkenesse corinthian colacinthus a naughtie pot hearbe marred a whole pot of pottage king christ saith in the like case of the pharisies let them alone they are the blinde leaders of the blind math we may yeeld in things indifferent but not in points of religion in matters of this world we may be indifferent and of neither side but in matters of god we may not there is no halting betweene two religions the second point is they gaue not place by way of subiection the reason is the apostles were of highest authoritie simply to be beleeued in their doctrine and they had extraordinarie authoritie to punish them that rebelliously withstood them act amp amp act corinthian for this cause they were not to stand subiect to the iudgement and censure of any man they willingly suffered their doctrine to be tried yet were they not bound to subiection as other ministers of the new testament are corinthian ioh it may be said if they would not giue place by subiection howe then gaue they place answer there is two kinds of yeelding one by tolleration without approbation the other by subiection which is the greatest approbation that can be by the first it may be paul was content to giue place but not by the second here we see howe we are to yeeld to the corruptions of the times in which we liue whether they be in manners or in doctrine we are to giue place by meeke and patient bearing of that which we cannot mende but we are not to giue place by subiection the third point is the ende of pauls refusall that the truth of the gospell might continue that is that the gospel might be preserued in puritie and integritie in all things and by this paul giues vs to vnderstand that if circumcision be made a necessarie cause of iustification and saluation the truth of the gospel doeth not continue here let vs obserue that when iustification or saluation is ascribed to workes or sacraments the truth of the gospell giues place and falshood comes in the roome wherefore the religion of the church of rome is a meere deprauation of the gospel for it makes workes to be the meritorious causes of iustification amp saluation nay which is more it teacheth man to worship a peece of bread and to invocate dead man and to kneele downe to stockes and stones and of them that seemed to be great i learned nothing or i was not taught what they were in times past it makes no matter to me god accepteth no mans person for they that are the cheife did not communicate any thing to me here paul laies downe the second signe of his approbation namely that in conference he learned nothing of the cheife apostles and this he expresseth in the first words in which the concealement which he vseth is to be obserued for hauing begun a sentence he breakes it off in the middle and conceales the latter part and leaues it to be supplied by the reader thus of them that seemed to be great i was not taught or i learned nothing the like forme of speaking is vsed chronicle where iabez saith if the lord blesse me and be with me concealing the end of his sentence i will be thankefull thus and thus in the roome of this concealement paul puts an answer to an obiection for some man might take exception against his former speech thus thou callest the apostles great but thou speakest fainedly for thou knowest they were but poore fishermen to this he makes answer thus what they were once it makes no matter to me then he renders a reason of his answer god accepts no mans person this done he proceeds and renders a reason of his first speech he learned nothing of the cheefe apostles because they did not communicate any thing to him either in doctrine or counsell the vse this verse serues to expound other places in s john where christ promiseth to giue his spirit to his disciples to teach them all things ioh and to led them into all truth ioh now these promises directly and properly concerne the apostles and they are here verified in paul who was so farre forth taught by god and lead into all truth that the cheife apostles could not teach or communicate any thing to him for all this though paul and the rest were led into all truth that they could not erre yet were they not led into all holinesse of life that they could not sinne paul saith to will is present with me but he addes that he cannot doe the good he would christ saith to all the apostles he that is washed and is all cleane must still haue his feete washed ioh wherefore they are to be rebuked that thinke there must be no want at all in them that are preachers of the gospel and hereupon take occasion to despise their ministerie if they can spie any thing amisse in their doings vpon the same ground they might reiect the ministerie of the apostles for though they could not erre in preaching and writing and though they had no neede to be taught of any man yet were they not free from sinne in their liues and the chiefe of them sundrie times fayled againe here we learne that there is a good and lawful kind of boasting and that is when a man is disgraced and his disgrace is the dishonour of god and the disgrace of the gospel this makes paul here to say that he learned nothing of the chiefe apostles for if he had said otherwise he should haue bin reputed to be no more but an ordinarie disciple and the doctrine which he taught before this conference should haue bin called in question for this cause he stands vpon it that they did not communicate any thing vnto him vpon the like occasion he professeth that he will boast corinthian here the saying of salomon may be obiected let an other mans mouth praise thee and not thine owne prou i answer it sufficeth for the truth of sundrie prouerbs if they be commonly ordinarily and vsually true though they be not generally true thus ordinarily man are not to praise themselues yet in a speciall and extraordinarie case it may be otherwise and the manner which paul vseth in commending of himselfe is to be obserued first he doth it in great modestie because in speaking of himselfe he concealeth that part of the sentence which should haue serued to expresse his praise secondly in praising of himselfe he is not carried with envy but his care is to maintaine the good name of the rest of the apostles when he saith what they haue bin it is no matter to me here then we see that the atheists doe paul wrong who challenge him for pride and presumption as though he could not brooke an equall and withall skorned to learne of any againe by pauls example we are to take notice of a common sinne mens hearts are so possessed with selfe loue and they are so addicted to their owne praise that it is griefe to them to heare any praised beside theselues whereas loue binds vs as well to take care for the good name of others as of our owne when paul saith what they were in times past it matters not to me we learne that we are to esteeme of man not as they haue bin but as they are peter iames and john though they had bin fishermen yet are they honoured of paul as apostles therefore when man haue repented we may not vpbraid the with their liues past neither may we take occasion to contemne them that be in authoritie because we haue knowne what they haue bin heretofore but euery man is to be esteemed according to his calling and according to the grace of god giuen him like is god mercifull dealing toward vs for he accepts man not as they haue bin but as they are when they repent therefore if sathan shall at any time obiect thy life past say vnto him thus tell me not what i haue bin but tell me what i am and what i will be this sufficeth when we repent god accepteth the person of no man by person is meant not the substance of a man or the man himselfe but the outward qualitie or condition of man as countrey sexe birth condition of life riches pouertie nobilitie wisdome learning ampc and god is saide not to accept the person because he doth call man bestow his gifts and giue iudgement according to his owne wise and iust pleasure and not according to the outward appearance and condition of the person read iob it may be obiected that god deales not equally with them that are equall because all man are equall in adam and of them he chooseth some to eternall life and refuseth others i answer he is said to accept persons that deales vnequally with man beeing bound to deale equally now god is not thus bound because he is a soueraigne and absolute lord ouer all his creatures and may doe with his owne what he will math secondly it may be obiected that god had respect to abel and his sacrifice gen ans the condition of man is twofold outward inward outward standes in worldly and ciuill respects inward standes in a pure heart good conscience and faith vnfained for this onely was abel respected hebr though god accept not the outward person yet in euery nation he that feareth god is accepted of him act thirdly it may be obiected that god iudgeth euery man according to his workes ans though workes appeare outwardly yet the roote and ground of them is in the heart and the iudgement of god is according to them as they are fruits of the faith of the heart the vse all man are in this to be like vnto god their heauenly father not accepting persons in their dealings as magistrates in the exequution of iustice deut ministers in teaching and in the reproouing of sinne mark and all beleeuers who are not to haue religion in acceptation of persons iam this acceptation is the ruine of societies and it is the common fault for vsually elections are made offices bestowed and iustice exequuted with partialitie and with blind respects to countrey kinred friendship money secondly we are all taught to feare the iudgement of god and to prepare our selues with all diligence that we may be found worthie to stand before god in that great day for we must come naked before him and he will haue no respect to our birth our riches our learning therefore it is good for vs now to put on christ that in him we may be accepted for with him the father is well pleased thirdly we may not set our hearts vpon the outward things of this world because god doth not respect vs for them but we are earnestly to seeke after the things that make vs accepted with god as true faith righteousnes and good conscience rom againe superiours must be admonished to deale moderately with their inferiours coloss againe inferiours are to comfort themselues if they be oppressed in that god the iudge of all accepts no persons lastly here we learne that when we shall haue immediate fellowship with god in heauen all outward respect of persons shall cease god himselfe and the lamb christ iesus shall be all in all to the elect in the ende of the verse paul addes for they communicated nothing to me but to the contrarie rom may be obiected where paul desires to come to rome that he might be comforted by their mutuall faith both his and theirs answer though the apostles did communicate nothing to paul in respect of doctrine or iudgement yet might they or the meanest beleeuers conferre something vnto him in respect of comfort or the confirmation of his faith and thus much he signifieth to the romanes here is a good item for them that come to no sermons because they can learne nothing put the case they were as learned as the apostles yet might they profit in hearing in respect of comfort of faith and good affection but on the contrarie when they saw that the gospel ouer the vncircumcision was committed vnto me as the gospel ouer the circumcision was to peter for he that was mightie by peter in the apostleship ouer the circumcision was also mightie by me toward the gentiles and when iames and cephas and john knew the grace of god that was giuen to me which are accounted pillars they gaue to me and to barnabas the right had of fellowship that we should preach to the gentiles amp they vnto the circumcision the wordes of more difficultie are thus to be explaned contrariwise that is they did communicate nothing to me in way of correction but on the contrarie they gaue me the hand of fellowship againe the words circumcision and vncircumcision signifie the nation of the iewes and the gentiles the one circucised the other vncircucised and whe paul saith that the grace of god was giuen to him he meanes specially the gift of an apostle rom lastly to giue the right hand of fellowshippe to paul is to esteeme and acknowledge him for their collegue or fellowe apostle by giuing the right hand in token thereof the contents of the words are these here paul sets downe the third signe of his approbation namely that the cheife apostles acknowledged him for their fellow apostle v secondly he sets down the manner how the cheefe apostles acknowledged this fellowship and that was by making a couenant with paul that he should preach to the gentiles and peter to the iewes thirdly he sets down the impulsiue cause that mooued the apostles to receiue paul to their fellowship and that was the decree of god whereby he ordained that paul should be the cheife apostle to the gentiles and peter the cheife apostle among the iewes v lastly he sets down the signes whereby the apostles knew that paul was ordained the apostle of the gentiles and they are two the grace of god giuen him and the power of his ministerie among the gentiles v furthermore the things here contained are in a syllogisme disposed thus when the apostles saw that i was ordained the cheife apostle of the gentiles and peter of the iewes they acknowledged me for their fellow apostle and made a couenant with me that i should preach to the gentiles and peter to the jewes but when i was with them at ierusalem they saw that i was ordained the cheife apostle of the gentiles and peter of the iewes when the apostles saw that i was ordained the cheife apostle of the gentiles and peter of the iewes they acknowledged me for their fellow apostle and made a couenant with me that i should preach to the gentiles and peter to the jewes but when i was with them at ierusalem they saw that i was ordained the cheife apostle of the gentiles and peter of the iewes this minor is omitted yet the proofe thereof is set down thus for they saw the efficacie of my ministerie among the gentiles and the grace of god that was with me therefore they acknowledged me for their fellow apostle ampc the vse this text makes notably against the primacie of peter first therefore let vs obserue the ordinance of god here plainely expressed that paul should be the cheife apostle of the gentiles and peter the cheife apostle of the iewes and this may else where be gathered for the commission of the twelue apostles ran thus that they must first preach to ierusalem and iudea then to samaria and in the last place to the vttermost part of the earth act and pauls commission was that he should first preach to the gentiles and in the second place to the people of israel act it may be obiected that the commission of all the apostles was to goe into all the world and to preach to all man without exception mark answer this power and libertie christ gaue to all the apostles and he did not take it away afterward neuerthelesse he ordered it by a second decree that paul should specially haue care of the gentiles and peter of the iewes and this the lord did in great wisdome that confusion and discord might be auoided and a regard had of all prouinces through the world hence it followes that the primacie of peter ouer iewes amp gentiles is a supposed thing for the ordinance of god is that peter shall be cheife ouer the iewes and not ouer the gentiles which were almost all the world beside and thus the supremacie of the pope goes to the ground for if he hold of peter and succeede him in authoritie and office as he pretends he must challenge a superioritie ouer the iewes and he hath nothing to doe with vs for paul was cheife ouer the gentiles and not peter secondly this ordinance of god giues vs to vnderstand that the place math thou article peter and vpon this rocke will i build my church ampc and i wil giue thee the keies of the kingdome of heauen doth not containe a promise made to peter of a primacie ouer all the apostles and ouer the catholike church if christ had meant any such thing in these words he would not haue assigned the iewes to peter and all the nation of the world beside to paul thus we see how this text for many hudred yeares hath beene abused and is still at this day thirdly it is false which the papists teach that the place in s john feede my lambes and feede my sheepe giues a primacie to peter ouer the whole world for by the ordinance of god this feeding of lambes and sheep is limited to the nation of the iewes lastly whereas eusebius saith in his chronicle that peter was bishop of rome and sate there years it hath no likelihood of truth for then peter liued in the breach of an expresse commandement of god for a long time because the iewes were his speciall charge againe it is to be obserued in this text that iames peter john are made equall all being pillars and iames is first named and that not without cause for not peter but iames was the president of the councell of ierusalem because he spake the last and concluded all act therefore the first naming of peter in other places of scripture is no sufficient proofe of his supremacie thirdly peter here is said to make a couenant with paul that he shall be the apostle of the gentiles and peter of the iewes but if peter had bin head of the church for yeares togither and had but known the primacie which the papists giue to him he would not haue consented to this order it is alleadged that paul was the cheife apostle ouer the gentiles in respect of paines and labour and not in respect of iurisdiction i answer this distinction hath no ground in the word of god againe paul was an apostle and vsed his apostolicall authoritie ouer the gentiles and there is no ecclesiasticall person that is or can be aboue an apostle for he was simply to be beleeued in preaching and writing and had extraordinarie power giuen him by god to punish them that rebelled againe paul here saith that the gospel was committed to him and peter that is that they were put in trust with it hence we learne things the first that the gospel is not ours but god and that man are but the keepers of it for this we are to praise god the second is that the ministers of the word are to keep and maintaine the truth of it with all faithfulnesse and good conscience and further to apply it to the best vse and to the greatest good of man for this charge lies vpon them that are put in trust the third is that the gospel is a speciall treasure for this we in england are to giue vnto god all thankfulnes specially by bringing forth the fruits of the gospel in this dutie the most of vs come short and therfore we may iustly feare least god take from vs the gospel of life and giue it to a nation that will bring forth the fruit of it moreouer in that paul saith that god was mightie by him and peter to the iewes and gentiles we are to consider the efficacie of the ministerie of it three cautions are to be obserued the first that grace or power to regenerate is not included in the word preached as vertue to heale in a medicine paul saith he that planteth and he that watereth is not any thing corinthian to regenerate is the proper worke of god not agreeing to angels no not to the flesh of christ exalted aboue man and angels for the vertue to renew or regenerate is not in it as in a subiect but in the godhead of the son the second caution is that grace is not inseparably annexed and tyed to the word preached for to some it is the sauour of death to death the third is that the preaching of the word is an externall instrument of faith and regeneration and the proper effect of it is to declare or signifie and it is an instrument because when the ministers of the word doe by it signifie and declare what is to be done and what is the will of god the spirit of god inwardly inlightens the minde and inclines the heart to beleeue and obey hence we learne that it is a magicall fiction to suppose that fiue words for this is my bodie should transubstantiate the bread into the bodie of christ secondly we learne that the sacraments doe not conferre grace ex opere operato by the worke done for the word and sacraments are both of one nature sacraments beeing a visible word now the word amp the preaching of it doth not conferre grace but onely declare what god will conferre thirdly by this it appeares that charmes or spels haue not force in them to cure diseases and to worke wonders but by satanicall operation for the best word of all euen the word preached hath it not lastly we are here to be put in mind that we loose no time in hearing of the word for it is a meanes whereby we are clensed and renewed euery branch that bringeth forth fruit god purgeth it by his word and other meanes that it may bring forth more fruite ioh it is a thing to be obserued that the apostles at ierusalem acknowledged paul to be an apostle because he had the gift of an apostle and because his ministerie was powerfull amog the gentiles therefore they which haue the gift of teaching by whome also god is powerfull in the conuersion of sinners are ministers certenly called of god let them thinke on this that vtterly condemne the ministerie of the church of england for many teachers among vs can shew both the gift of teaching and the power or efficacy of their ministery it is worth the marking also that the apostles are called pillars here we see what is the charge of the ministers of the word namely to sustaine and to vphold the church by doctrine praier counsel good life elizeus is called of ioas the charrets and horsemen of israel king and the church of god vpon earth is called the pillar and ground of trueth in respect of the ministerie of the word tim againe in that all ministers in their places according to the measure of gifts receiued are pillars they are admonished hereby to be constant in the truth against all enemy whatsoeuer it is the praise of john the baptist that he was not as a reed shaken of the winde math all beleeuers are to stand fast in temptation against their spirituall enemy ephesians and this they shall the better doe if they be directed by the good example of their teachers thirdly in that ministers are pillars we are taught to cleaue vnto them and their ministerie at all times in life and death for we are liuing stones in the temple of god christ is our foundation and they be pillars to hold vs vp and therefore not to be forsaken deut furthermore paul at this time was not accounted a pillar for he saith thus iames cephas john are accounted pillars as who should say i am accounted none thus paul goes through good report and euill report and is content to be contemned lastly the example of concord among the apostles is to be obserued in that they giue the right hands of fellowship one to an other warning onely that we should remember the poore which thing also i was diligent to doe in these words paul sets downe the fourth and last signe of his approbation at ierusalem on this manner at my departing the apostles warned me to remember the poore and of no other thing did they giue me warning therefore there was a full and perfect consent betweene vs in the wordes two things are set downe the apostolicall warning and the practise of it by paul the warning in these words warning onely that we should remember the poore in them three points are to be considered the first that the church of ierusalem is in extreame pouertie and the causes of it may be two the first because the poorer sort receiued the gospel thus it was in corinthian corinthian not many wise according to the flesh not many mightie not many noble the like we in experience at this day the poorer sort among vs doe more heartily receiue it then they of the richer sort by this we are taught that we may not fixe our loue and our confidence vpon riches amp they that buie must be as though they bought not and they that possesse as though they possessed not because riches steale away the heart the second cause of their pouertie was that they were depriued of their riches for the profession of the name of christ thess heb here we are taught to sit downe and to recken what the profession of christ will cost vs to the vttermost and we must put this in our account that we must be readie and willing to part with the deerest things in the world for the name of christ and this reckning and resolution must we daily carrie about with vs the second point is why the church of ierusalem must be releeued by the gentiles considering by god law deut euery place must releeue his owne poore ans we are first of all debters to our owne poore and they must first be releeued this done in the case of extreame necessitie we are debters to the poore a thousand miles off and in this case did the apostles craue releefe of the gentiles for them of ierusalem the third point is that the apostles themselues are carefull for the gathering of releefe hence we learne that it is the office of pastours and teachers not only to preach and dispence the word but also to haue care of the poore and this care is to be shewed in exhortation counsell ouersight as for the administration and execution of matters belonging to the poore it belongs to others if the apostles at any time gathered carried and dispensed releefe it was because the church was not yet founded and planted and therefore there was no other to doe it now i come to the practise of paul in these words which thing also i was diligent to doe it here first let vs marke that paul who had spoiled and made hauocke of the church of ierusalem now gathers releefe and as we say begges for it and no doubt the rather that he may make some recompence for the wrong he had done by his example we are taught to make satisfaction for all iniuries and hurts done to others and that to the vttermost he that steales according to the qualitie of his theft must restore either twofold or fourefold exod he that maimes a man must pay for his healing and for his resting that is for the losse of his labour exod daniel saith to nabuchadnezzar o king breake off thy sinnes with almes deedes daniel that is whereas thou hast bin giuen to crueltie and oppression cease to doe so any more and make some recompence by giuing of almes dauid saith it is the propertie of a wicked man to borrow and not to repay psalm satisfaction recompence and restitution is the way to life by the appointment of god ezech and if thou restore the pledge and repay that which thou hast robbed thou shalt liue and not die the lord saith are the treasures of wickednes yet in the house of the wicked and he addes that he will not iustifie the false ballance mich zacheus in his conuersion for known wrongs restores fourefold and for his vnknown wrongs he giues halfe his goods to the poore luke let vsurers ingrossers and all that oppresse or deale deceitfully remember this and begin to make conscience of this du ty of satisfaction or restitution and that it may the better be practised i will further set downe fiue points the first is who must satisfie and restore ans he that is the cause of any wrong or losse to others and all they that are accessarie man may be accessarie many waies by commaundement by counsell by consent by partnership by receiuing by silence when a man ought to speake by not hindring when he ought to hinder by not manifesting that which we ought to manifest the second is to whom must restitution be made ans to him that is wronged and beares the losse if the partie be knowne and aliue if he be dead to his heires if all be dead to the poore if the person wronged be not knowne to vs as often it falls out then restitution is to be made to the church or commonwealth and restitution is to be turned into almes for the poore daniel moreouer if both the giuing and the receiuing of a thing be unlawful as in bribes and simoniacall gifts restitution is not to be made to the giuer but as before it is to be applied to common vse specially to releefe the third point is what must be restored ans the things which are of vsvniustly receiued or deteined either known to vs or vnknowne if they be knowne they are in their owne kind to be restored or in value exod if the partie who is to restore be in extreame pouertie and haue not wherewith to make recompence he must doe that which he can that is he must shew a readie and willing minde and this is done by confession and by crauing of pardon if goods to be restored be for their value and quatitie vnknowne then restitution must be made according to the iudgement and discretion of them that are wise the fourth point is touching the time when ans in respect of preparation of mind we must presently satisfie yet not in respect of execution for the act of restitution may be deferred if there be ignorance of the right or ignorance of the fact if the restorer be in extreame neede if vpon present restitution life goods or good name be indangered the last point is in what order and manner restitution is to be made ans things certen must first be restored and things vncerten after among things certen that is which certenly belongs vnto an other things bought and not deliuered are to be restored and deposita things committed to our trust if things to be restored for their value and qualitie be vncerten the order is this restitution must be made according to the discretion of wise man in some part and for the rest pardon to be craued againe in restitution warines is to be vsed least by supplying the losses of other man we make to our selues the losse of good name againe in pauls practise we see an earnest care and diligence to prouide for the poore and his diligence is further expressed ro where it is said that he ministred to the saints at ierusalem and withall that he gaue himselfe no rest in this dutie till he had sealed this fruit vnto them that is till he saw it done according to his desire his example must be followed of vs it is not enough for vs to giue good words and to wish well but we must in our places and callings doe our endeauour that releefe may euen be sealed to our poore and there be many reasons to mooue vs first let vs consider that the charge was very great to maintaine the altar of the lord in the old testament with sheepe and oxen and offerings of all kinds and now in the new testament the poore come in the roome of the altar secondly the poore represent the person of christ and in them he comes vnto vs and saith j am hungrie i am sicke i am naked i am harbourlesse therfore looke what we would doe to christ the same must we doe to them thirdly the poore haue title and interest to part of our goods for god is the lord of them and we are but stewards to dispose and vse them according to his appointment and his will is that part of our goods be giuen for the releefe of the poore if this be not done we are theeues in respect of the goods we possesse lastly mercie or the bowels of compassion in vs is a pledge or an impression of the mercie that is in god towards vs and by it we may knowe or feele in our selues that mercie belongs vnto vs thus we see what is our dutie nowe let vs consider what is our fault not to blame any person or persons it is our common fault that we are backeward and slacke in this dutie and the cause is that we doe not heartily giue our selues to christ and this makes vs to be so slacke in giuing our goods to the poore corinthian againe we commonly liue as it were without a law we doe not with dauid set the laws of god before vs psalm v neither doe we apply our hearts to his statutes v for then would we with dauid make haste to keepe the commandements of god v specially this great commandement of releefe and the rather because the obseruing of it is the inriching of vs all lastly let vs marke that paul beeing warned of the apostles was diligent to doe that whereof he was warned the like must we doe it is not sufficient to heare but beside this there must be in vs a care and diligence to doe and practise that which we heare for this is to build vpon the rocke and it is a common fault to heare much and doe little ezech v and when peter was come to antioch i withstood him to his face for he was to be blamed in these words paul propounds the second answer which he makes to the obiection mentioned in the beginning of the chap to this effect though the church glorifie god for thee yet wil not the apostles do it because thou article contrary to the here paul answers that there was indeed a dissention between him and peter when he withstood peter to his face at antioch but the fault was not his but peters who was wholly to be blamed for the better vnderstanding of these words three points are to be handled the first is who was resisted the answer is peter the apostle for the intent of this chapter is to shewe what agreement there was betweene paul and the rest of the apostles and there was no apostle of this name but one therefore they among the auncient are greatly deceiued who thinke that the apostle peter was not reprooued but some other of that name the second point is who resisted answer paul and that not for shewe and fashion but in truth and good earnest and this appeares because in the words following he sets downe a waightie and vrgent cause of his reproofe therefore ierom and others are deceiued who thinke that paul reprooued peter simulat non ver in shewe and appearance and not in good earnest the third point is what was pauls minde and meaning in resisting of peter answer to doe his office the kingdom of god and all things pertaining thereto must haue free passage without resistance the second petition is thy kingdome come john the baptist preached thus prepare the way of the lord and make his paths straight mark saint paul saith praie that the word of god may haue free passage and be glorified thess contrariwise such things as hinder the kingdom of god must be withstood therefore peter saith resist your aduersarie the deuill strong in faith pet and thus man that are instruments of euill are to be withstood and here paul by an holy reproofe withstands peter for his bad example in paul here first we may behold an example of true vertue in that he resists euill to the vttermost of his power following his owne rule abhorre that which is euill and cleaue vnto that which is good rom haue no fellowship with the vnfruitfull workes of darkenes but rather reprooue them ephesians in like manner must euery one of vs resist euill first in himselfe and then in them that appertaine to him therefore paul saith to all put on the armour of god that ye may resist ephesians here things may be demaded first what must we resist paul answers again principality and powers and spirituall wickednesses that is the deuill and all his angels it may be said we haue no dealing with them for they vse not to appeare vnto vs ans that the deuill comes not vnto vs visibly but in the persons of euill man and in the badde examples of all man this made christ say to peter math come behind me satan for thou article an offence vnto me when peter would haue disswaded him from going to ierusalem again it may be said in what things must we resist them paul answereth in heauenly things v that is in things which pertaine to god kingdome and concerne either the saluation of our soules or the worship of god for the deuill seeketh by all manner of euils to hinder these good things moreouer this dutie of resisting euill is so necessarie that we must resist sinne if neede be to the very shedding of our blood heb againe we haue in paul an example of bouldnes and libertie in reproouing of sinne this was a thing commanded to the prophets and apostles isai crie and spare not lift vp thy voice like a trumpet shew my people their transgression ierem trusse vp thy loines arise and speake vnto them all that i commaund thee be not afraid of their faces left i destroy thee before them like libertie may the ministers of the word vse obseruing pauls rule tim god hath not giuen vs the spirit of feare but of power and of loue and of a sound minde where he sets downe three caueats first that this libertie in reprouing is not the fruite of a bold and rash disposition but it is a fruit of god spirit and so to be acknowledged read mich the secod that the vse of this libertie is to be ordered by a sound mind whereby we are able to giue a good ac count of our reproofes both for the matter and manner of them the third is that all our admonitions must be seasoned and tempered with loue that they tend to the good and saluation of them that are reproued these caueats obserued libertie in reproouing shall neuer want his blessing isai thirdly here is an example in paul of an ingenious amp ho nest minde when he sees peter doe amisse he reprooues him to his face contrarie to this is the common practise in backbiting whispering amp tale bearing whereby it comes to passe that when a man is in fault euery man knowes it saue he which is in fault this vice the lawe of god expressely forbids leu and it is the propertie of a good man not to take vp a false reporte psalm and dauid reproues soul because he did but lend the eare to tale bearers saying wherefore giuest thou an eare to mens wordes that say behould dauid seeketh euill against thee sam in peter who when he was reproued made no reply we see an example of patience and humiltie whereby he humbled himselfe before the reprouer when he was conuicted of an offence the like was in dauid when he said let the righteous smite mee psalm v where as paul saith that peter was to be blamed or condemned not in respect of his person but of his example we see that excellent man euen the cheefe apostles are subiect to erre and be deceiued it may be said howe then may we trust them in their writings i answer while they were in deliuering any thing to the church whether it were by sermon or wri ting they were guided by the infallible assistance of the spirit and could not erre otherwise they might erre when they were out of this worke in mind will affection or action thus ionas when he saw that niniue was not destroyed was impotent in his anger nathan was deceiued in giuing aduise to dauid touching the building of the temple sam the apostles at the ascension of christ still dreamed of an earthly kingdome saying when wilt thou restore the kingdome to israel act and peter beeing bidden to arise and eate of things forbidden by the ceremonial law said not so lord act thus then if peter was subiect to errour the pretended successours of peter namely the bishops of rome cannot be free from errour it is alleadged that peter erred in life and not in doctrine i answer it was so indeed yet did his bad example tend to the ruine of doctrine if it had not bin preuented therefore the errour that was in acte if we respect the euent was in doctrine againe i answer that an errour in action presupposeth an errour in minde or at the least some ignorance because the minde is the beginning of the thing done thus all sinners are called ignorant persons hebr and it seemes that the errour of peter was that of two euils it was the best to choose the lesse that is to choose rather to offend the gentiles then the iewes to whome he was an apostle specially appointed here againe we miserable wrethes are taught to watch and pray that god would not lead vs into temptation considering most excellent man are subiect to falling and man must be warned not to abuse peters example in boulstering themselues in their naughtie waies by saying we are all sinners that the best man aliue is a sinner that the iust man falles seuen times a day for the place in the prouerbs is spoken of affliction and not of sinne the iust man falls seuen times that is he falles into manifould perills and further we should not only consider the faults of iust man but also their conuersion and repentance and againe to sinne and to commit sinne are two diverse things though the godly sinne yet doe they not keepe a course in sinning and goe on from sinne to sinne v for before certen came from iames he ate with the gentiles but when they were come he withdrew himselfe fearing them that were of the circumcision and other iewes dissembled likewise with him in so much that barnabas was brought into their dissimulation also the apostle hath propounded his second answer in the former verse now he proceedes to make a declaration of it and first he sets downe the cause why peter was reproued and the manner of reprofe the cause is the and verses namely peters sinne and this sinne is set forth by foure things by the name of the sinne the matter of the sinne the cause of the sinne the effects of the sinne the name of the sinne is noted when paul saith and other iewes dissembled likewise with him v where i gather that peters sinne was simulation simulation of it selfe is a thing indifferent and according to circumstances is either good or euill lawful simulation is when man conceit that which they may lawfully conceit and signifie something either by word or deede that is onely beside the truth and not contrarie to it this was the simulation of ioseph who carried himselfe as a stranger to his brother in egypt after he had examined them and knew who they were gen this was the simulation of christ who when he was come to emaus made as though he would haue gone further luke thus paul among the iewes plaid the iewe corinthian unlawful simulation is that when something is signified or fained against the truth or to the preiudice of any of this kind was the simulation of peter which tended to the preiudice of the gospel and to the offence of the gentiles the second point is the matter of the sinne or the sinne it selfe which was on this manner first among the gentiles at antioch he vseth christian libertie in eating things forbidden by the ceremoniall law yet after the comming of certen iewes from ierus lem he seperates himselfe from the gentiles and plaies the iewe among the iewes like to this was the halting of the israelites betweene god and baal king and the practise of sundrie man who are protestant with vs and yet in other country goe to masse and the practise of our people who change their religion with the times here we see the great weaknesse of peter in that vpon a very little occasion and that presently falls away from his profession to his old course in him we may behold our owne weakenesse and consider what we are like to doe in like case we nowe professe the gospell of christ yet if any occasion were offe ed it is to be feared that many of vs would be easily mooued to returne to our old prophanenesse and to the superstition of popery but for the staying and the better establishing of our mindes let vs alwaies remember that they shall perish who withdraw themselues from their faith profession and obedience which they owe vnto god heb psalm againe here it must be obserued that paul in describing the sinne expresseth two actions his eating with the gentiles and his seperation from them the first good and the latter euill the beginning of his action was good but the end of it was naught the reason is this the man regenerate is partly flesh and partly spirit and hereupon it is that when we will that which is good we cannot accomplish it and euill is present with vs the child of god is like a lame man that goes the right way but yet halts at euery step abraha amp sara desire ishue that is from the spirit but they desire ishue by agar their handmaid that is from the flesh rebecca seekes the blessing for iacob that is a worke of the spirit but shee seekes it by lying that is from the flesh peter eates with the gentiles that is from christian libertie he after seperates himselfe that is from corruption thus we see that the best workes are imperfect amp mixed with corruption and that for the best workes we must humble our selues and seeke pardon not in respect of the goodnesse of the worke but in respect of the defect thereof it may be demanded how the acte of peter should be a sin considering he did onely abstaine from certaine meates that he might auoide the offence of certen iewes answer the fact of peter considered by it selfe is not a sinne for paul did the like in playing the iewe but the circumstances make it a sinne for first of all peter doth not onely abstaine from meates forbidden by the ceremoniall lawe but also he withdrawes himselfe from the company of the gentiles and keepes company apart with the iewes secondly he abstaines not among the iewes at ierusalem but at n ch among the gentiles where a little before he had openly done the contrarie in vsing his christian libertie thirdly he vsed this abstinence when certen iewes c m from ierusalem to search out the libertie of the gentiles fourthly while peter seekes to auoid the small offence of some iewes he incurres a greater offence of all the gentiles lastly this acte of peter did tend to the ouerthrowing of pauls ministerie and the suppressing of the truth of the gospel thus then the act of peter becomes unlawful that was otherwise lawefull beeing simply considered by it selfe here it may be demanded what peter should haue done ans he shoul haue openly withstood the iewes that came from ierusalem as paul withstood them that vrged the circumcision of titus or againe before he had plaid the iew he should haue aduertised the gentiles that for a time he was to yeeld to the infirmitie of some iewes in peters example we are taught that we must not offend god though all the world be offended lesse offences must giue place when the great offence is at hand that is when god is dishonoured and the very least part of his trueth is suppressed the third point to be con idered is the cause of the sinne of peter and that was the feare of the offence of the iewes here two questions are to be handled the first how peters feare should be a sinne ans there is a naturall feare created by god and placed in the heart of man this feare of it selfe is good neuerthelesse by the corruption of nature it becomes euill and it is made euill two waies one is when man feare without cause as when the disciples feare christ walking vpon the sea and feare drowning when christ was in the ship with the the other is whe there is no measure in feare as whe man so feare the creature that they neglect their dutie to god this was peters feare and it was a sinne in him for god is to be feared simply because he is lord of bodie and soule and can destroy both and he is to be feared for himselfe whereas euery creature is to be feared in part onely and for god rom by this we are taught daily to inure our selues in our hearts to feare god aboue all things the second question is how peter could haue the feare of god considering he feared man more then god at the least in this one action ans there are three kinds of feare one is without all sinne this was in adam and in christ the second is altogether sinnefull in the wicked and vngodly because it is seuered from faith and obedience as when there is a feare of man without the feare of god the third is a mixed feare in them that are regenerate in whome the feare of god is ioyned with the corrupt feare of man and in this mixture otherwhiles the one preuailes otherwhiles the other and this feare was in peter in whome at this time the carnall feare of man preuailed against the true feare of god paul notes feare to be the cause of peters sinne that he may thereby signifie vnto vs what kind of sinne it was namely a sinne not of malice but of infirmitie a sinne of infirmitie is when there is a purpose in the heart not to sinne and yet for all this the sinne is committed by reason the will is ouercarried by temptation or by violence of affection as by feare anger lust thus peter sinned and let it be remembred that to sinne of infirmitie i properly incident to such as be regenerate as peter was euery wicked man makes his sinne his infirmitie fornication is the infirmitie of the ornicatour drunkennes the infirmitie of the drunkard ampc but it is false which they say for they sinne with all their hearts when they sinne the fourth and last point is the effect of peters sinne in drawing the iewes and barnabas to the like dissimulation here we see the contagion of euill example and hence we learne that minis ers of the word must of necessitie ioyne with good doctrine the example of good life for first of all it is the exp es e commandement of god pet be patternes of the flocke tim be an ensample in word conuersion loue spirit faith puritie philipp what ye haue seene in me that doe math let your light so shine before man that they may see your good works secodly practise in the minister is a part of his teaching for the multitude doe not ma ke so much what man say as what man doe herod did many things not because john the baptist was a good minister but because he was a good man mark thirdly ministers haue not the presence amp protection of god vnlesse their liues be vertuous and godly if thou turne thou shalt stand before me ierem god reueales his secrets to the prophets his servant amos lastly fearefull iudgements of god belong to ministers of wicked liues destruction befalls the sonnes of eli and their families because they by leud example made the people of god to sinne sam the like befell the sonnes of aaron for their presumption againe all superiours are warned to goe before their inferiours by good example when moses went into egypt to be the guide of the israelites the lord would haue destroied him by reason of the bad example in his owne familie namely the vncircumcision of his child dauid for his euill exaple whereby he caused the enemy of god to blaspheme is punished and that after his repentance that man might see in him an example of god iudgement against sinne sam here againe we see that the consent of many together is not a note of truth peter barnabas and the iewes all together are deceiued and paul alone hath the truth panormitane saith that a laie man bringing scripture is to be preferred before a whole councell paphnutius alone had the truth and the whole councell of nice inclined to errour but when i saw that they went not with a right foote to the truth of the gospel i said to peter before all man if thou beeing a iew liuest as the gentiles and not like the iewes why constrainest thou the gentiles to doe like the iewes in these words paul sets downe the reproofe of peter and the whole manner of it in it many points are to be considered the first is the time of this reproofe and that was so soone as paul saw the offence of peter here we learne that we must resist and cut off the first beginnings of temptation of sinne and of superstition because we are prone to cuill and therefore if it once set footing in vs it will take place the second point is the foundation of the reproofe in these wordes when i saw and that is a certen knowledge of peters offence here we are to take notice of the common fault and that is that we vse to censure and condemne man specially publike persons vpon suspitions and coniectures and hearesay whereas we should not open our mouthes to reprooue till we haue certen knowledge of the fault moreouer publike persons as magistrates and ministers haue their priuiledge that an accusation is not to be receiued against them without there be a proofe by two or three witnesses tim the third point is the fault reprooued which is here expressed by an other name not to walke with a right foote to the truth of the gospel that is not to conuerse with man and to carrie himselfe so as he may be sutable to the sinceritie of the gospel both in word and deede here is a notable dutie set downe for all man to walke with an euen foote according to the truth of the gospel and this is done when in word and deede and euery way we ascribe all the good we haue or can doe to grace to mercie and to christ when againe in word and deede and euery way we giue all thanks to god for grace and mercie by christ here two sorts of man are to be condemned as haulters in respect of the truth of the gospel the first are papists who ioyne christ and workes in the cause of our iustification and saluation the second are carnall protestant and all other sorts of man that professe the name of christ and withall challenge to themselues a libertie to liue as they list for they walke contrarie to the gospel disioyning iustification and sanctification faith and good life remission of sinne and mortification this is the rife and common sinne of our daies we are light in the lord but we walke not as children of light we are content to come to the marriage of the kings son but we come not with the marriage garment it is to be feared this very sinne will banish the gospel and bring all the iudgements of god vpon vs let vs therefore repent of our vneuen and haulting liues and preuent the lord anger by walking worthie the gospel of christ it will besaid how must we performe this dutie ans two rules must be remembred the first is that we must haue and carrie in vs a right heart for the want of this was simon magus condemned act a right heart is an humble and an honest heart the humble heart is when in the estimation of our owne hearts we abase our selues vnder all creatures vpon earth and that for our offences when againe in the affection of our hearts we exalt the death and blood of christ aboue all riches aboue all honours aboue all pleasures aboue all ioyes and aboue all that heart can thinke or tongue can speake the honest heart is when we carrie and cherish in our hearts the setled purpose of not sinning so as if we sinne at any time we may in the testimonie of a good conscience say that we sinned against our purpose the second rule is that we must make straight steppes to our feete hebr and that is done when we endeauour to obey god according to all his commandements psalm and also according to all the powers of the inward man that is not onely in action but also in will affection and thought let vs also applie our hearts to the doing of this least if we come to the marriage of the kings son without the garment of a right heart and life we heare the sentence binde them hand and foote and cast them into vtter darknes there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth the fourth point is the place of reproofe before all man for they that sinne openly to the offence of many are openly to be reprooued tim the fifth point is concerning the reasons which paul vseth for the restraining of the sinne of peter the first is set downe in the verse if thou beeing a iew ampc here the meaning of some words are to be opened to iudaise or to liue as a iew is to obserue and that necessarily a difference of meates and times according to the ceremoniall law of moses to gentilize or to liue as a gentile is to vse meats and drink and times freely without difference peter is said to compell the gentiles to iudaise not by teaching of any doctrine for the apostles neuer erred in teaching and deliuering any thing to the church of god this is a principle therefore he constrained them by the authoritie of his example whereby he caused them to thinke that the obseruation of the ceremoniall law was necessarie the first reason then is framed thus if thou beeing a iew vsest to liue as the gentiles thou maist not by thy example compell the gentiles to iudaize in the necessarie obseruation of ceremonies but thou beeing a iew vsest to liue as the gentiles therefore thou maist not compell the gentiles to liue as iewes here first let vs obserue the force of euill example it compells man to be euill therefore let all superiours magistrates ministers and all gouernours of families looke to their examples for if they be euill they constraine others also to be euill here againe we see what wonderfull subiection the ancient beleeuers yeelded to the ministerie of the word for if the actions of the apostles compelled man to do this or that what then did their doctrines and heauenly exhortations do when john the baptist preached the kingdome of heauen suffered violence and the violent tooke it to themselues when the disciples preached in iewrie they saw satan falling downe from heauen like lightning the weapons of paul were spirituall to cast downe holds and to bring euery thought in subiection to god here the fault of our time is to be considered we haue the forme of godlines in hearing and in outward profession but we want the power of it for we doe not in heart yeeld subiection by suffering our selues to be vrged and compelled to obedience by the authoritie of the ministerie thirdly here we see wherein stood peters sinne namely in that he constrained man to a necessarie obseruation of the ceremoniall law by his example binding the gentiles to the doing of that which the gospel hath made free therefore great is the wickednes of the romane religion in that it placeth a necessitie in many things in the vse whereof christ hath procured vs an holy and christian libertie in this respect the vowes of perpetuall continencie of pouertie and regular obedience are falsly tearned states of perfection and are indeede estates of abomination we which are iewes by nature and not sinners of the gentiles know that a man is not iustified by the workes of the law but by the faith of iesus christ which i say haue beleeued in iesus christ that we might be iustified by the faith of iesus christ and not by the works of the law because by the workes of the law no flesh shall be iustified here paul laies downe the second reason of his reproofe it is framed thus that which we defend both in iudgement and practise that must we vrge and not the contrarie but iustification by faith without workes we defend both in iudgement and practise therefore we must vrge it and not the contrarie namely the necessarie obseruation of the law the major is wanting the minor is expressed in the v and it is amplified by an argument of things diverse thus though we be iewes to whome the law was giuen yet we forsake the law and looke to be iustified by the faith of christ secondly the minor is confirmed by a testimony of the psalme v by the workes of the law no flesh shall be iustified here two points are to be handled one of the distinction of the iewes and gentiles the other of iustification touching the distinction of iewes and gentiles sundrie points are to be handled the first what is the cause of this distinction ans the good will and pleasure of god moses saith god chose the israelites boue all nation deut he loued them deut when he de ded the nation lacob was his portion deut he knew them aboue all nation saith amos and he chose them because he loued their fathers deut hence we gather the free election of god and that they are deceiued who thinke that there was no difference of iewes and gen les in respect of god but in respect of themselues because the one imbraced christ the other refused christ but there cannot be a refusall where the messias was not knowne and among the gentiles he was not so much as named rom the second point is wherein stands the difference of iewes and gentiles ans here the iewes are opposed to sinners of the gentiles and therefore by the iewes are meant an holy and peculiar people the distinction therefore lies in this that the one was holy the other prophane the one in the couenant the other out of the couenant rom psalm here two errours must be auoided one that the difference lay in earthly things which is not true for the law was giuen to the israelites and it was a schoolemaster to christ gal and an introduction to a better hope hebr the second errour is that they differed onely in this that christ was more plentifully and fully reuealed to the iewes more darkly and sparingly to the gentiles but it was otherwise for the gentiles were without god and christ ephesians and they were left to themselues to walke in their owne aies act the third point is how long this difference indured ans till the death of christ for the disciples were forbidden to goe into the way of the gentiles math and christ saith that he was not sent but to the l st sheepe of the house of israel mat it may be obiected that here we see the difference of iewes and gentiles is st nding long after the ascension of christ ans christ in his death did fully merit the abolishment of this difference ephesians neuerthelesse the execution of this abolishment was by degrees and it was at this time begunne by the ministerie of the apostles yet not accomplished the last point is that the iewes are an holy people by nature not because holines is conuaied to them by generation but because euen from their beginning and birth by vertue of the couenant they are holy if the roote be holy the branches are holy rom if either of their parents beleeue their children are holy corinthian in a ciuill contract the father and his heire make but one person and the father couenants for himselfe and his posteritie euen so in the couenant of grace he beleeues for himselfe and withall makes his posteritie partaker of the said couenant and thus the posteritie becomes holy it may be obiected that whatsoeuer is borne of flesh is flesh ans the parent sustaines a double person first he is to be considered as a child of adam and thus he brings forth a child hauing with adams nature adams corruption againe he is to be considered as a beleeuer and thus albeit he doth not propagate his faith and holines to his child yet by meanes of his saith his child is in the couenant and consequently is to be accounted holy in the iudgement of charitie till god manifest the contrarie againe it may be obiected that if the children of beleeuing parents be borne holy they want originall finne ans the children also sustaine two persons first they are to be considered as children of the first adam and thus they are conceiued and borne in sinne and are children of wrath againe they are to be considered as children of beleeuing parents and thus by meanes of the couenant they are children of god and originall sinne which is in them is couered from their first beginning and not imputed to them the vse there was no absolute necessitie of circumcision for they which died before the eight day were borne holy and consequently in the couenant and therefore might be saued and thus baptisme was not of absolute necessitie for the children of beleeuers are borne holy and christian and therefore dying in the want of baptisme may for all that be saued the seale of the couenant is not of like necessitie with the couenant it selfe secondly here we learne that it is not the act of baptisme to conferre the first grace but onely to confirme and seale it vnto vs adoption and life beginnes not in baptisme but before if the roote be holy the branches springing thenee are holy we are borne christians if our parents beleeue and not made so in baptisme lastly if we be borne holy it is our shame that we haue made no more proceeding in holines then we haue done the most remaine ignorant and vnreformed and they of the better sort either stand at a stay or goe backward the second point is concerning iustification in the v of which sundrie things are there propounded and first i will beginne with the name the word iustifie is borrowed from courts of iudgement and signifies a indiciall act otherwhiles it is put for the action of the iudge and then it signifies to absolue or to pronounce innocent thus paul saith act that we are instified from all things from which we could not be iustified by the law of moses that is absolued or cleered againe he opposeth iustification to accusation and condemnation rom now the contrarie to condemnation is absolution sometimes againe the word iustifie signifies the act of the partie iudged or of the witnesses and then it imports as much as to giue testimonie or to declare and approoue thus iames saith abraham was iustified by workes chap v that is declared and approoued to be a iust man by workes in the former signification is the word vsed where the holy ghost deliuereth the doctrine of iustification as in this place the vse here we see how to distinguish betweene iustification regeneration and renouation regeneration is vsually in scripture the change of the inward man whereby we are borne anew renouation is the change both of the inward and outward man that is both of heart and life iustification is neither but a certaine action in god applied vnto vs or a certaine respect or relation whereby we are acquit of our sinnes and accepted to life euerlasting secondly we must here note that the teachers of the church of rome mistake the word iustification for by it they vnderstand nothing els but a physicall transmutation of the qualitie and disposition of our hearts from euill to good and by this mistaking they haue made a mixture or rather confusion of law and gospel thirdly here we see what is to be the disposition of the partie iustified for by the consequent we may learne the antecedent a man therfore that would be iustified must come before the iudgement seat of god and there must he plead guiltie and be his owne aduersa ie condemning himselfe and beeing pressed with the terrours of the law he must flie and make his appeale to the throne of grace for pardon in christ and then he shall be acquit or iustified from all sinner thus much doth the word stifie import thus came the publican before god luke when he said lord be mercifull to me a sinner and departed iustified thus in the sift petition we are taught to come euery day into the presence of god and to acknowledge our debts and to vse the plea of mercie saying forgiue vs our debts the second thing to be considered is the subiect of iustification or the person to be iustified and that is man generally signifying that a man is iustified the holy ghost speaketh thus generally for two causes the first is because all man without exception haue need of iustification euen they which are regenerate rom and in this place paul saith that he and peter and the rest haue beleeued in christ that they might be iustified by faith here we are to take notice of the miserable condition of prophane and secure epicures who neuer so much as dreame of any iustification the second reason is because god communicates the benefit of iustification generally to all sorts of man and this he doth in the ministerie of the word in which he beseecheth man to be reconciled to god corinthian v this must be an inducement vnto vs to come vnto christ humbling and iudging our selues that we may be iustified god himselfe from heauen vseth reasons vnto vs daily to mooue vs to the practise of this dutie what meane these gratious and continuall preseruations of prince and people church and land by them we see it is the good pleasure of god to giue vs a time to seeke his kingdome and righteousnes wherefore let vs not neglect the day of visitation but take the time while it serues that we may turne vnto god and be accepted of him and escape the woe pronounced vpon corazin and bethsaida the third thing to be considered concernes things excluded from iustification as false causes namely the works of the law here it may be demanded what works are meant i answer first not onely workes of the ceremoniall but also of the morall law for all man know that ceremoniall actions are of no vse vnlesse they be ioyned with morall duties of loue and mercie and if paul meant onely ceremoniall workes he needed not to haue made so long a discourse against iustification by workes for he might haue ended the whole matter in a word or twaine by shewing that the ceremoniall law was abrogated by christ secondly i answer that not onely workes done before faith are excluded but also workes that follow faith and are done in the estate of grace for paul here reasons thus if no flesh be iustified by workes then not we beleeuers but no flesh at all is iustified therefore not we beleeuers dauid psalm reasoneth on the same manner no flesh shall be iustified in thy fight therefore i cannot though otherwise i be thy servant in keeping thy commandements when abraham was the father of all the faithfull and was come to the highest degree of faith and abounded in good workes yet was he not then iustified by workes rom paul kept a good conscience before god and man act and yet was he not iustified therby corinthian and he saith that we are not saued by the workes which god hath ordained that we should walke in ephesians and the workes that god hath ordained for vs to walke in are the best workes of all euen workes of grace againe he saith that we are not saued by workes of mercie tit it may be obiected that there is a cooperation of works and faith i am i answer that this cooperation is not in the act of iustification nor in the worke of our saluation but in the manifestation of the truth and sinceritie of our faith without hypocrisie and for the declaration and approbation of this faith and workes ioyntly concurre here then we see it is a pestilent and damnable doctrine of the papists when they teach iustification by the workes of the law let vs here be warned to take heede of it the fourth point is the meritorious cause of our iustification and that is christ here it may be demanded what is that thing in christ by and for which we are iustified i answer the obedience of christ rom and it stands in two things his passion in life and death and his fulfilling of the law ioyned therewith for by faith the law is established rom christ was sent in the similitude of sinnefull flesh that the rigour of the law might be fulfilled in vs rom and christ is the perfection of the law for righteousnes to all that beleeue rom he that doth not fulfill all things contained in the law is accursed gal seeing therefore we cannot performe the things contained therein by our selues we must performe them in the person of our mediatour who hath satisfied for the threatnings of the law by his passion and hath fulfilled the precepts of the law by his obedience in all duties of loue to god and man we owe to god a double debt one is that we are to fulfill the law euery moment from our first beginning both in regard of puritie of nature and puritie of action and this debt was laid vpon vs in the creation and is exacted of vs in the law of god the second debt is a satisfaction for the breach of the law for this double debt christ is be become our suretie and god accepts his obedience for vs it beeing a full satisfaction according to the tenour of the law for the better conceiuing of this obedience foure questions may be demanded the first is when this obedience beginnes and ends ans satisfactorie obedience performed by christ beginnes in his incarnation amp ends in his death christ saith ioh it is my meate to doe my fathers will and to finish his worke but when was it indeede finished a little before his passion he said ioh i haue finished the worke which thou gauest me to doe againe in the surrendring of his soule he saith it is finished ioh s paul saith christ was obedient to the death of the crosse philipp the triumph of christ beganne vpon the crosse column and he could not triumph before he had made a full and perfect satisfaction for vs when christ had procured deliuerance from hell and right to life euerlasting he there made a perfect satisfaction for vs to the iustice of god and this he did in his death vpon the crosse for by the death of the mediatour we receiue the promise of euerlasting inheritance heb and with one oblation vpon the crosse he perfected them that are sanctified heb and they cannot be perfected without the perfect obedience of christ christ rose from death and ascended into heauen in our roome and stead and this he could neuer haue done vnlesse he had made a perfect satisfaction in death here it may be asked if satisfactorie obedience end in the death of christ to what vse serue the resurrection and ascension of christ and his fitting at the right hand of the father ans they serue also for our iustification but after an other sort for they serue to applie amp communicate to vs and to put vs in possession of the benefits which christ hath procured for vs and purchased by his death s paul saith he as nded to giue gifts and to fill all things ephesians and christ saith when i am exalted i will draw all man to me ioh and he liues for euer to make intercession for vs heb the second question is how christ could obey beeing god and satisfie for vs beeing man ans christ must be considered not meerely as god or as man but as god man or man god for the godhead doth not redeeme vs without the manhood nor the manhood without the godhead neuerthelesse christ as god and man may both obey and satisfie for as there are in christ two natures so there are two distinct operations of the said natures and as the said natures vnited make one christ so the operations of the natures concurring and beeing vnited in one make the compound worke of a mediatour therefore the obedience of christ beeing the worke of a mediatour hath in it the operations of both natures the practise exercise or exequution of obedience is from the manhood therfore it is said that christ bare our sinnes in his bodie vpon the crosse pet that he suffered in the flesh pet that he made a liuing way by the vaile of his flesh heb that we are reconciled in the bodie of his flesh coloss obedience i properly a subiection of the will in reasonable creatures to the will of god now the will of the godhead of christ admits no subiection to the will of god because the the will of the godhead or of god is one and the same in all the persons christ therefore yeeldes subiection onely in respect of the will of the manhoode in which he performes obedience moreouer the operation of the godhead is to make the saide obedience meritorious and satisfactorie for all that shall beleeue in this respect paul saith god was in christ reconciling the world vnto himselfe corinthian and that god shedde his blood act namely in that nature which the son of god assumed hence ariseth the value price and dignitie of the obedience of christ the third question is how the obedience of christ should be made ours ans by the freedonation of god for christ is really giuen vnto vs in the word and sacraments and consequently the obedience of christ is made ours euen as when a peece of ground is made ours the commoditie thereof is ours also the fourth question is how the obedience of christ should be our iustice ans it is not our iustice in naturall manner for then it should be in vs but by a diuine and supernaturall manner namely by god acceptation in that he accounts it ours euen as truly as if it were in vs and because god accepts it for ours it is ours indeede for his willing and approouing of any thing is the doing of it and he calls the things that are not as if they were thus we see what the obedience of christ is and here two errours must be auoided the one is of some protestant lesse dangerous yet an vntruth namely that we are iustified onely by the passion of christ but if this were so we should be iustified without fulfilling the law for as i haue said we owe to god a double debt one by creation namely the fulfilling of the law in all things from our first beginning the second since the fall of adam namely a satisfaction for the breach of the law now the passion of christ is a paiment of the second debt but not of the first whereas both must be answered for cursed is he that doth not continue in all things written in the law to doe them the passion of christ procureth deliuerance from hell but alone by it selfe considered it doth not purchase a right to eternall life obiect i christ fulfilled the law for himselfe therefore his passion alone serues for our iustification ans christ as man fulfilled the law for himselfe that he might be in both natures an holy high priest and so continue neuertheles as mediatour god and man he became subiect to the law in this regard he did not fulfill the law for himselfe neither was he boud so to doe obiect ii that which christ did we are not bound to doe but christ say some fulfilled the law for vs therefore we are not bound to fulfill the law ans that which christ did we are not bound to doe for the same ende and in the same manner now he fulfilled the law in way of redemption and satisfaction for vs and so doe not we fulfill the law but onely in way of thankfulnes for our redemption obiect iii the law doth exact both obedience and the penaltie also ans in the estate of innocencie the law threatned the penaltie and it onely exacted obedience since the fall it exacteth both obedience and the punishment the threatning of the law exacts the punishment the precepts exact obediece obiect iu hebr by the blood of christ we haue entrance into the holy place ans by the blood of christ we are to vnderstand the passion and the passion may not be seuered from actiue and voluntarie obedience for christ in suffering obaied and in obeying suffered and as chrysostom saith the passion is a kind of action christ in the oblation of himselfe did not onely offer to god his passion but also praiers which are no passions heb the second errour is of the papists who teach that the thing by which and for which a sinner is formally iustified is remission of sinnes with inherent justice infused by the holy ghost but this cannot be for inherent iustice and iustification are made distinct gifts of god paul saith christ is made vnto vs of god wisdome iustice sanctification corinthian againe but ye are washed ye are iustified and sanctified corinthian secondly the iustice whereby a sinner is iustified is reuealed without the law rom now inherent iustice or the habit of charitie is reuealed by the law and the obedience of christ is the onely iustice reuealed without the law for it is a iustice imputed that the law neuer knew and in this obedience christ performed the law and more too for he died for his enemy and so loued his neighbour more then himselfe thirdly god is not onely a iustifier but also iust in iustifying rom because he iustifieth none but such as bring vnto a him a true and perfect iustice either in themselues or in their mediatour prou now this inward and inherent iustice is not such for it is imperfect because it is increased as they teach by a second iustification and it is in this life mixed with the corruption of the flesh fourthly the righteousnes of a good conscience is an excellent grace and gift of god but by it we are not iustified corinthian lastly a close errour is to be noted in this popish doctrine of iustification for in popish learning remission of sinnes is not onely an abolishing of the guilt and the punishment but also of the corruption of sinne so as the partie pardoned and iustified hath nothing in him that as they say god may iustly hate and yet paul iustified and regenerate saith otherwise of himselfe that sinne dwelleth in him and that the law of sinne rebells in him against the law of his minde and leads him captiue to sinne rom the vse of the doctrine first in that we are iustified by an obedience out of our selues we are taught vtterly to denie our selues and to goe out of our selues as hauing nothing in vs whereby we may be saued here is the foundation of the abnegation of our selues secondly the obedience of christ must be vnto vs the foundation of our obedience for he performed all righteousnes for vs that we might be servant not of sinne but servant of righteousnes in all duties of obedience and in his obedience we must not onely respect the merit thereof but also his holy example in loue mercie meekenes patience ampc and after it are we to fashion our liues thirdly the obedience of christ must be the foundation of our comfort in all daungers and temptations we that beleeue are to oppose the obedience of christ against the fierce wrath of god against hell death and condemnation certen beast when they are pursued flie the next way to their dennes where they hold themselues euen to death christ in respect of his obedience is our hiding place rom he is set forth unto the world as a propitiatorie for as the propitiatorie couered the arke and the decasogue so he couereth our sinnes and he hides our body amp soules from the furious indignation and vengeance of god let vs therefore by our faith flie to this our hiding place in the storme and tempest of god wrath and let vs there liue and die fourthly this obedience is the foundation of our happines for true happines is to be eased of our sinnes psalm and this ease we haue from christ math lastly the consideration of this obedience is the foundation of our thankfulnes to god for if we beleeue that christ suffered and fulfilled the law for vs we are worse then beast if we doe not euery way shew our selues thankfull for this mercie the fifth point to be considered is the meanes of iustification namely the faith of christ of which i consider things the first what faith is the papists define iustifying faith to be a gift of god whereby we beleeue the articles of faith to be true and the whole word of god but thit faith the deuills hanc here they alleadge that abraham was the father of all the faithfull and that his faith was nothing els but a perswasion that he was able to giue him a child in his old age ans first the obiect of abrahams faith was double one lesse principall that he should haue ishew in his old age the second more principall that the messias his redeemer should descend of his loines and this was the thing which his faith in the promise of god specially aimed at i answer againe that abraham beleeued not onely the power of god rom but also his will which he had reuealed in the promise in thy seede all the nation of the earth shall be blessed secondly it is alleadged that christ in the curing of certaine blind man required no more but that they should beleeue his power math i answer that the ende of the miracles of christ was to confirme the certentie of doctrine specially touching his natures and offices and therefore a generall faith touching the diuine power or godhead of christ was sufficient for the obtaining of a miraculous cure thirdly they obiect that saluation is promised to generall faith rom if thou shalt confesse with thy mouth the lord iesus and beleeue that god raised him from the dead thou shalt be saued that peters faith was generall math thou article iesus christ the son of the liuing god that the eunuchs faith was of the same kind act i beleeue that iesus christ is the son of god ans it is a common rule in scripture that words signifying knowledge signifie also the motions and good affections of the heart psalm the lord knowes the way of the righteous that is knowes and approoues it tim the lord knowes who are his that is he knoweth and chooseth them ioh this is eternall life to know thee the onely god that is to know and acknowledge thee for our god if this be true in wordes of knowledge then much more wordes of beleeuing signifie the good motions and the affiance of the heart thus to beleeue christ to be the son of god in the places before named is to beleeue that he is god and withall to fixe our affiance on him otherwise the deuills beleeue thus much when thomas had put his finger in the side of christ he saide my lord and my god ioh and to this speech of his christ faith thou hast seene and beleeued this then is true faith not onely to beleeue that christ is god but also that he is our god iustifying faith in true manner is defined thus it is a gift whereby we apprehend christ and his benefits ioh to beleeue in christ and to receiue christ are put both for one ioh faith is the mouth of the soule whereby we eate the flesh of christ and drinke his blood ioh to receiue the word of christ to acknowledge it and to beleeue it are put all for one paul saith that the gentiles did apprehend the iustice which is by faith rom againe that we receiue the promise of the spirit by faith gel this apprehension stands in two things the first is to know christ as he propounds himselfe in the word and sacraments the second is to applie him and his benefits vnto our selues this application is made by a supernaturall act of the vnderstanding when we beleeue that christ with his benefits is really ours it may be obiected that faith is a certen confidence whereby we beleeue in christ and so it is described euen in this text ans i faith and confidence properly are distinct gifts of god and confidence is the effect or fruit of faith for paul saith that we haue entrance to god with confidence by faith ephesians and reason declares as much for a man can not put his confidence in christ till he be assured that christ with his benefits are his we doe not rest on his goodnes of whose loue we doubt secondly i answer that confidence beeing a most notable effect of faith is often in scripture put for faith and faith is described by it as it is in this place and yet for nature they are not one but must be distinguished furthermore the grounds of apprehension must be considered for speciall faith must haue a speciall and infallible ground the grounds are three the first is this in the gospel god hath propounded generall promises of remission of sinnes and life euerlasting by christ and withall he hath giuen a commandement to apply the said promises to our selues ioh this is the commandement of god that ye beleeue in the name of his son iesus christ and we cannot beleeue in christ till we beleeue christ to be our christ now then a generall promise with a commandement to applie the same to our selues is in effect as much as a speciall promise the second ground is this rom the spirit of god testifieth together with our spirit that we are the sonnes of god in this testimonie foure things must be obserued the first that it is sufficient to certifie and assure vs of our saluation for if the testimonie of two or three witnesses establish a truth among man then much more the testimonie of god the second is that this testimonie may be certenly knowne els it is no testimonie vnto vs the third is that this testimonie is found and perceiued in the vse of the word praier sacraments the last that it is especially giuen and felt in the time of great danger and affliction for when by reason of miserie and trouble we know not to pray as we ought then the spirit makes request for vs with groanes that cannot be vttered rom and in afflictions paul saith the loue of god is shedde abroad in our hearts now then if god giue to them that turne vnto him a testimonie that they are the children of god they for their parts are by speciall faith to beleeue it the third ground is this a speciall faith may be gathered partly vpon things generally reuealed in the word of god and partly vpon sense obseruation and experience the same things beeing reuealed generally in the word and particularly by experience vpon this ground may we truly conclude the forgiuenes of our sinnes amp the saluation of our soules on this manner he which beleeueth hath the forgiuenes of his sinnes but i beleeue in christ saith he which beleeueth therefore my sinnes are forgiuen me the major or first part is expressed in the word the minor or second part is found true by experience and by the testimonie of the conscience which is a certen testimonie for paul saith this is my reioycing the testimonie of my conscience corinthian and the conclusion is the conclusion of speciall faith if this be not a good and sufficient ground there is almost no speciall faith in the world lastly we are to consider the degrees of apprehension and they are two there is a weake apprehension and there is a strong apprehension is there is a weake and a strong faith the weake faith and apprehension is when we endeauour to apprehend this endeauour is when we bewaile our vnbeleefe striue against our manifold doubtings will to beleeue with an honest heart desire to be reconciled to god and constantly vse the good meanes to beleeue for god accepts the will to beleeue for faith it selfe and the will to repent for repentance the reason hereof is plaine euery supernaturall act presupposeth a supernaturall power or gift and therefore the will to beleeue and repent presupposeth the power and gift of faith and repentance in the heart it may be obiected that in the mindes of them that beleeue in this manner doubtings of god mercie abound ans though doubtings abound neuer so yet are they not of the nature of faith but are contrarie to it secondly we must put difference between true apprehension amp strong apprehension and strong apprehension if we truly apprehend though not strongly it sufficeth the palsie hand is able to receiue a gift though not so strongly as an other the man in the gospel said lord i beleeue helpe mine vnbeleefe mark that is helpe my faith which by reason of the smalnes thereof may rather be called vnbeleefe then faith this is the common faith of true beleeuers for in this world we rather liue by hungring and thirsting then by full apprehending of christ and our comfort stands rather in this that we are knowne of god then that we know god the highest degree of faith is a full perswasion of god mercie thus saith the holy ghost that abraham was not weake through vnbeleefe but strong in faith rom but wherein was this strength in that he was fully perswaded that god which had promised would also performe it this measure of faith is not incident to all beleeuers but to the prophets apostles martyrs and such as haue beene long exercised in the schoole of christ and this appeares by the order whereby we attaine to this degree of faith first there must be a knowledge of christ then followes a generall perswasion of the possibilitie of pardon and mercie whereby we beleeue that our sinnes are pardonable an example whereof we haue in the prodigall child luke after this the h ghost worketh a will and desire to beleeue and stirres vp the heart to make humble and serious inuocation for pardon after praier instantly made followes a setling and quieting of the conscience according to the promise math knocke it shall be opened seeke ye shall finde aske ye shall receiue after all this followes an experience in manifold obseruations of the mercies of god and loue in christ and after experience followes a full perswasion abraham had not this full perswasion till god had sundrie times spoken to him dauid vpon much triall of the mercie amp fauour of god growes to resolution and saith psalm doubilesse kindnes and mercie shall follow me all the daies of my life this distinction of the degrees of faith must the rather be obserued because the papists suppose that we teach that euery faith is a full perswasion and that euery one among vs hath this perswasion which is otherwise for certentie we ascribe to all faith but not fulnes of certentie neither doe we teach that all man must haue a full perswasion at the first the vse if that be the right faith which apprehends and applies christ vnto vs then is it a poore and miserable faith of the papist to be baptized and withall to beleeue as the church doth when it is not knowne what the church beleeues of the same kind is the faith of the multitude amog vs whose faith is their good meaning that is their fidelitie and truth in their dealings lastly if that be faith which truly apprehends christ there is little true faith in these last daies for though the merit of christ be apprehended by faith yet is not the efficacie of his death and that appeares by the bad and vnreformed liues of them that professe the gospel indeede many say they haue and euer had a strong perswasion of god mercie but in the most of them it is but a strong imagination for their faith was conceiued without the word praier sacraments and it is seuered from good life we are then all of vs carefully to seeke for this true and liuely faith and the rather because faith and repentance are possible to all that by grace doe will it nay they which will to beleeue and repent haue begunne to beleeue and repent god accepting the will for the deede luke and hauing attained to a measure of true faith we must goe on and seeke to iustifie our selues but yet as s iames teacheth c iustifie our faith by good workes and then shall our faith be a meanes to iustifie vs in life and death the second point to be considered concerning faith is the manner how it iustifieth the papists teach that it iustifieth because it stirreth vp good motions and good affections in the heart whereby it prepareth and disposeth man that he may be fit to receiue his iustification againe because it beeing an excellent vertue meriteth that god should iustifie but this is false which they say for if faith iustifieth by disposing the heart then there must be a space of time betweene iustification and iustifying faith but there is no space of time betweene them for so soone as a man beleeues he is presently iustified for euery beleeuer hath the promise of remission of sinnes and life euerlasting againe in the case of iustification paul opposeth beleeuing and doing faith and workes of the law faith therefore doth not iustifie as a worke or as an excellent vertue bringing forth many diuine and gratious operations in vs nay the proper action of faith which is apprehension doth not iustifie of it selfe for it is imperfect and is to be increased to the ende of our daies faith therefore iustifieth because it is an instrument to apprehend and applie that which iustifieth namely christ and his obedience as the israelites stung of fierie serpents were cured so are we saued ioh the israelites did nothing at all but onely looke vpon the brasen serpent so are we to doe nothing for our iustification and saluation but to fixe the eye of our faith on christ the bankrupt paies his debt by accepting the paiment made by his suretie it is the propertie of true religion to depresse nature and to exalt grace and this is done when we make god the onely worker of our saluation and make our selues to be no more but receiuers of the mercie and grace of god by faith amp receiuers not by nature but by grace reaching out the beggers hand namely our faith in christ to receiue the gift or almes of mercie the last point is that faith alone iustifieth for here paul saith that we are iustified by faith without the workes of the law and that is as much as if he had said by faith alone some papists to helpe themselues translate the words of paul thus knowing that a man is not iustified by the workes of the law if not by faith that is except faith goe withall then if faith be ioyned with workes say they workes iustifie i answer that this manner of translation corrupteth the text for must here be translated but as appeares by the wordes following we haue beleeued in christ that we might be iustified by faith in christ without the workes of the law we cannot doe more in the curing of our spirituall diseases then in the curing of the diseases of our bodie of which christ saith onely beleeue mark when abraham abounded both in faith and works rom it is said that he was iustified by faith without workes this doctrine is of great vse first we learne hence that a man is iustified by the meere mercie of god and that there is excluded from iustification all merit of congruitie all meritorious workes of preparation wrought by vs all cooperation of mans will with god grace in the effecting of our iustification secondly we learne that a man is iustified by the meere merit of christ that is by the meritorious obedience which he wrought in himselfe and not by any thing wrought by him in vs here then our merits and satisfactions and all inward iustice is excluded from the iustification of a sinner to this end paul saith that we are iustified freely by the redemption that is in christ rom that we are made the iustice of god in him and not in vs corinthian that he gaue himselfe to deliuer vs gal that he hath purged our sinnes by himselfe heb and not by any thing in vs hence it appeares that the papists erre and are deceiued when they teach that christ did merit that we might merit and satisfie for our selues for then we should not be iustified by our faith alone thirdly hence we learne that a sinner is iustified by meere faith that is that nothing within vs concurres as a cause of our iustification but faith and that nothing apprehends christs obedience for our iustification but faith this will more easily appeare if we compare faith hope and loue faith is like an hand that opens it selfe to receiue a gift and so is neither loue nor hope loue is also an hand but yet an hand that giues out communicates and distributes for as faith receiues christ into our hearts so loue opens the heart and powers out praise and thanks to god and all manner of goodnes to man hope is no hand but an eye that wishly looketh and waiteth for the good things which faith beleeueth therefore it is the onely propertie of faith to claspe and lay hold of christ and his benefits it is obiected that true faith is neuer alone i answer thus faith is neuer alone in the person iustified nor in godly conuersation but is ioyned with all other vertues yet in the act and office of iustification it is alone the eye in the bodie is not alone beeing ioyned with all other parts hand foote ampc neuerthelesse the eye in seeing is alone for no part of the bodie seeth but the eye secondly it may be obiected that beeing iustified by faith alone we are saued by faith alone and so may liue as we list i answer faith must be considered as an instrument or as a way if it be considered as an instrument to apprehend christ to our saluation we are onely saued by faith on this manner yet if faith be considered as a way we are not onely saued by faith for all other vertues and workes are the way to life as well as faith though they be not causes of saluation thirdly it is obiected that not onely faith but also the sacraments serue to applie christ i answer they are saide to applie in that they serue to confirme faith whole office is to applie and here let vs take notice of the errour of the papists who teach that our satisfactions serue to applie the satisfaction of christ and the sacrifice of the masse to applie the sacrifice of christ vpon the crosse whereas nothing indeede applies but faith in the sixt place we are to consider the kindes of iustification the papists make two one when a man of an euill man is made a good man the second when a good man is made better and this they say is by workes but it is false which they teach for the iewes which were borne an holy and peculiar people to god by meanes of the couenant were iustified as paul here saith by faith without workes againe he saith that the very ende of our beleeuing is that we may be iustified by faith without workes therefore there is one onely iustification and no more and that by faith without workes the seuenth point is the ground of this doctrine of iustification by faith without workes and it is laid downe in the end of the verse no flesh shall be iustified by the workes of the law and this ground is taken as i suppose from psalme v it may be alleadged that dauid saith thus no flesh shall be iustified in thy sight and that the other words by the workes of the law are not expressed i answer that the apostles and christ in citing places of the old testament applie them and expound them and hereupon sometime adde words without adding to the sense moses saith him shalt thou serue deut christ alleadging the same wordes saith him onely shalt thou serue math dauid saith sacrifice and burnt offer thou wouldest not but mine eares hast thou pearced psalm the author to the hebrewes citing this text saith sacrifice and burnt offer thou wouldest not but a bodie hast thou fitted me heb and thus the pearcing of the eare is explaned for indeede it signifies to be made obedient and to this ende was a bodie giuen to christ that he might obey his fathers will the eight and last point is the practise of them that are iustified and that is to beleeue or put their trust in christ trust in the lord saith the prophet and ye shal be assured chronicle and salomon saith roll your care on the lord prou by meanes of this faith the heart of the righteous is fixed and stablished psalm for the better practise of this dutie two rules must be remembred the one is that faith and the practise thereof must raigne in the heart and haue all at command we must not goe by sense feeling reason but we must shut our eyes and let faith keepe our hearts close to the promise of god nay faith must ouerrule nature and command nature and the strongest affections thereof thus abraham beleeued against hope and by faith was content to offer his naturall and onely begotten son hebr if faith ouerrule nature then much more must it haue all the lusts and corruptions of nature at command the second rule is that when we know not what to doe by reason of the greatnes of our distresse we must then fixe our hearts on christ without seperation he that climes vp a ladder or some steepe place the higher he goes the faster he holds chronicle iob hence is true comfort psalm and if while we seeke to be made righteous by christ we our selues are found sinners is christ the minister of sinne god forbid for the better vnderstanding of the latter part of this chapter it must be obserued that paul directs his speach not onely to peter but also to the iewes that stood by beeing maintainers of iustification by the law some thinke that in this verse paul makes an obiection in the person of the false apostles on this manner if we be iustified by christ alone without the obseruation of the law then there is no difference betweene vs iewes and the gentiles but we are as deepe sinners as they and if this be so then christ is the minister of sinne and then they say to this paul answers god forbid but i somewhat doubt whether this be the sense of the words because paul doth not make a direct confutation of this obiection in the words following therefore i rather suppose that paul continues his former speach euen to the ende of the chapter and that in these words he vseth a third reason to disswade peter from haulting betweene the iewes and gentiles and the reason will the better appeare if we search the meaning of the words if while we be iustified by christ that is by faith in christ without the workes of the law we are found sinners that is found in our sinnes not fully iustified but are further to be iustified by the workes of the law is christ the minister of sinne that is doth it not hence follow that christ ministred vnto vs occasion of sinne in that he hath caused vs to renounce the iustice of the law god forbid that is ye doe all hold it with me as a blasphemie that christ should be the minister of sinne the argument then is framed thus if beeing iustified by christ we remaine sinners and are further to be iustified by the law then christ is the minister of sinne but christ is no minister of sinne therefore they which are iustified neede not further to be iustified by the law the vse first we learne hence that it is a blasphemie to make christ the minister of sinne who is the minister of righteousnes yes iustice it selfe isa daniel he brings euerlasting righteousnes ioh he is the lambe of god that takes away the sinnes of the world of this all the prophets giue testimonie act therefore atheists are no better then deuills that recken him among the false prophets of the world and many of them that professe christ are greatly to be blamed that make christ the greatest sinner in the world because christ died for them therefore they prefume of mercie and take libertie to liue as they list againe paul here teacheth that they which are iustified by christ are perfectly to be iustified and neede not further to be iustified by any thing out of christ as by the workes of the law it may be obiected that they which are iustified feele themselues to be sinners rom ans the corruption of original sinne is in them that are iustified yet is it not imputed to them by god and withall it hath receiued his deadly wound by the death of christ therefore they which are iustified are not reputed sinners before god againe it may be obiected that they which are iustified must confesse themselues to be sinners to the very death ans confession of sinne is not a cause but a way for the obtaining of pardon prou ioh the vncouering of our sinnes is the way to couer them before god the sinnes therefore of man iustified vpon their humble and serious confession are not sinnes imputed but couered vpon this doctrine it followes that there is not a second iustification by workes as the papists teach for he that is iustified by christ is fully iustified and neede not further be iustified by any thing out of christ as by the law againe the same persons teach that our sinnes are done away by the death of christ and we iustified in our baptisme and that if we fall and sinne after baptisme we must doe workes of penance that we may satisfie god iustice and be further iustified by our works and sufferings but then by their leaues after we are iustified by christ we are found sinners and we are further to be iustified by our owne workes now this is the point which paul here confuteth againe by this doctrine we learne that christ alone is by himselfe sufficient for our iustification in him saith paul are we complete column he is a well of grace and life neuer dried vp ioh thirdly we must content our selues with him alone and with his obedience for our iustification despising in respect of him all merits and satisfactions done by man lastly here we see what must be the care of man in this world namely to seeke to be iustified by the faith of christ it was pauls principall desire to be found in christ hauing not his owne righteousnes but the righteousnes which is by the faith of christ philipp the like desire should be in vs all for if i build againe the things which i haue destroied i make my selfe a transgressour by things destroyed paul meanes the workes or the iustice of the law as appeares by the next verse following where rendering a reason of this he saith by the law i am dead to the law these words depend on the former thus paul had said before that christ was not a minister of sinne vnto vs and here he prooues it thus he that builds the iustice of the law which he hath destroied is a minister of sinne or makes himselfe a sinner but the iewes and peter by his example build the iustice of the law which they haue destroied and so doth not christ therefore the iewes and peter make themselues sinners and christ doth not make vs sinners here let vs obserue the modestie and meeknes of paul the things which he speakes concerne peter and the iewes yet least he offend them he applies them to himselfe this care not to offend was in christ who was rather willing to depart fro his right then to offend matth and paul biddes vs please all man in that which is good here againe it is pauls doctrine that we make our selues offendours when we build that which we haue lawfully destroied thus teachers are great offenders when good doctrine is ioyned with bad conuersation for good doctrine destroies the kingdome of darknes and bad conuersation builds it vp againe thus rulers are great offenders when good counsell and bad example goe together for good counsell beats downe wickednes and bad example sets it vp againe thus beleeuers in christ are great offenders when reformed religion and vnreformed life are ioyned together as often they are for then vnreformed life builds the kingdome of sinne which christ hath destroied further we are here taught to be constant in that which is good tit and to hold fast the gospel which we professe we haue put vnder foote the popish religion for this many yeares our dutie is to be constant herein and no way to build either in word or deede that which we haue to the vttermost of our power destroied for i through the law am dead to the law that i may liue vnto god in these words paul sets downe a second reason to prooue christ to be no minister of sinne in abolishing the iustice of the law and the reason is framed thus we iewes iustified by christ are dead to the law not to liue as we list but to liue to the honour of god therefore christ in taking away the iustice of the law is not the minister of sinne here three points are propounded the first is that the person iustified is dead to the law the second that he is dead to the law by the law the third that he is dead that he may liue vnto god for the better vnderstanding of the first point we must seach what is meant by dying to the law here the law is compared to an hard and cruell master and we to slaues or bondmen who so long as they are aliue they are vnder the dominion and at the command of their masters yet when they are dead they are free from that bondage and their masters haue no more to doe with them here then to be dead to the law is to be free from the dominion of the law and we are free in foure respects first in respect of the accusing and damnatorie sentence of the law rom secondly in respect of the power of the law whereby as an occasion it prouoketh and stirreth vp the corruption of the heart in the vnregenerate rom thirdly in respect of the rigour of the law whereby it exacteth most perfect obedience for our iustification thus paul here saith that he is dead to the law lastly in respect of the obligation of the conscience to the obseruation of ceremonies column thus are all persons iustified by the faith of christ free from the law hence we learne that the papists erre and are deceiued when they teach that the law and the gospel are one for substance of doctrine for then they which are iustified by christ should not onely be dead to the law but also to the gospel now the scripture saith not that persons iustified are dead to the gospel they erre againe in that they teach that persons iustified by the merit of the death of christ are further to be iustified by the workes of the law for he that is iustified by christ is dead to the law but if we be iustified by workes then are we by christ made aliue to the law thirdly here we see how long the dominion of the law continueth and when it endeth the law raignes ouer all man without exception till they be iustified when they once beginne to beleeue in christ and to amend their liues then the dominion of the law ceaseth and they then are no more vnder the law but vnder grace here all such persons as liue in the securitie and hardnes of their hearts are to be admonished to repent of their sinnes and to beginne to turne vnto god for they must know that they liue vnder a most hard and cruell master that will doe nothing but accuse terrifie amp condemne them and cause them to runne headlong to vtter desperation and if they die beeing vnder the law they must looke for nothing but death and destruction without mercie for the law is mer ilesse this consideration serueth notably to awake them that are dead in their sinnes againe all such as with true and honest hearts haue begunne to repent and beleeue let them be of good comfort for they are not vnder the dominion of the law but they are dead to the law and vnder grace hauing a lord who is also their mercifull sauiour who will giue them protection against the terrours of the law and spare them as a father spares his child that serues him and not breake them though they be but as weake and bruised reedes and as smoaking flaxe the second point is touching the meanes of our death to the law and that is the law here some by the law vnderstand the law of faith that is the gospel rom and they make this to be the meaning of the words by the law of christ that is by the gospel i am dead to the law of moses but this sense though it be a truth yet will it not stand in this place for it is the question whether by the gospel we be freed from the law now paul a learned disputer would not bring the question to prooue it selfe therefore i take the true meaning of the words to be this by the law of moses i am dead to the law of moses it may be demanded how this can be considering the law is the cause of no good thing in vs for it is the ministerie of death and condemnation corinthian againe that which the law cannot reueale it cannot worke but the law neither can nor doth reueale faith in christ the death to the law nor repentance ampc therefore the law is no cause to worke them it may peraduenture be said that the law workes repentance and sorrow for sinne i answer there is a double repentance one legall the other euangelicall legall is when man haue a sight of their sinnes and withall are grieued for the punishment thereof this repentance is wrought by the ministerie of the law it was in iudas and it is no grace of god but of it selfe it is the way to hell euangelicall repentance is when beeing turned by grace we turne our selues to god this repentance is a gift of grace and is not wrought by the law but by the ministerie of the gospel again there is a legall sorrow which is a sorrow for sinne in respect of the punishment this is no grace and it is wrought by the law euangelicall sorrow is sorrow for sinne because it is sinne this indeede is a grace of god but it is not wrought by the law but by the preaching of mercy and reconciliation and it followes in vs vpon the apprehension of god mercie by faith the law then beeing the cause of no good thing in vs it may be demanded i say how we should be dead to the law by the law ans though the law be not a cause of this death to the law and so to sinne yet it is an occasion thereof for it accuseth and terrifieth and condemneth vs and therby it occasioneth or vrgeth vs to flie vnto christ who is the cause that we die vnto the law as the needle goes before and drawes in the third which sowes the cloth so the law goes before and makes a way that grace may follow after and take place in the heart thus must this place be vnderstood and all other places that speake of the law in this manner as rom ampc the third point is touching the ende of our death to the law and that is that we may liue to god it may be demanded what life this is whereby we liue to god ans there is a naturall and a spirituall life naturall life is that which we receiue from adam by generation and it is the function of naturall faculties in liuing moouing vse of senses and reason spirituall life is that which we receiue from christ by regeneration and it is the action motion or operation of the spirit in vs this life is called by paul the life of god ephesians and this is the life which he speakes of in this place and it is described by many things first by the ende and vse of it for it serues to make vs to liue to god that is to the honour and glorie of god and we liue to god by liuing wisely godly iustly tit wisely in respect of our selues godly in respect of god iustly in respect of man that we may liue wisely we must obserue two rules the first we must labour with all diligence and with all speede that we may be worthie to stand before the son of man at his comming and therefore we must labour to be in christ hauing true faith and good conscience ephesians luke consider also the example of paul act it is true wisdome to be wise for our soules and for euerlasting happines and it was the follie of the foolish virgin that they did not surnish themselues with the oyle of grace in time conuenient the second rule we must in this world come as neere heauen and the happines of life euerlasting as may be psalm and for this cause we must ioyne our selues to the assemblies where the word is preached praier made and sacraments administred for there is the gate of heauen consider the practise of moses heb and of dauid psalm againe beeing absent from heauen both in bodie and soule yet we must haue our conuersation there by the cogitation of our mindes and by the affections of our hearts philipp that we may liue godlily seuen rules must be remembred the first we must bring our selues into the presence of the inuisible god yes we must set our thoughts wills affections and all we doe in his sight and presence and we must euermore remeber whatsoeuer we doe that we haue to deale with god himselfe in this regard enoch is said to walke with god gen abraham and isaac before god gen and and dauid psalm and all and cornelius act and paul corinthian the second we must take knowledge of the will of god in all things whether it be reuealed in the word or by any euent it is not enough to know god will but when time and place serues we must acknowledge it rom column the third we must bring our selues in subiection to the knowne will of god and captiuate all our senses vnto it and suffer god to set vp his kingdome in vs rom the fourth when we haue offended god we must instantly humble our selues before his maiestie confessing our offences and making instant deprecation for mercie thus did ezra chap and daniel chap and dauid psalm the fifth in all our miseries and aduersities we must be silent in our hearts by quieting our wills in the good will of god psalm examine your selues and be still psalm be silent to iehoua consider the example of aaron leuit of dauid psalm of the iewes act the sixth in all things we doe or suffer we must depend on the goodnes prouidence and mercie of god for the successe of our labours and for ease or deliuerance out of miserie this is to liue by faith and as peter saith pet to sanctifie god in our hearts the last in all things we must giue praise and thankes to god and that for our miseries and afflictions iob for in them god mingles his iustice with mercie whereas he might vtterly condemne vs that we may liue iustly in respect of man two rules must be obserued the first we must make god in christ our treasure and our portion and his fauour and blessing our riches then shall not the vile sinnes of auarice and ambition beare sway in vs and then shall we learne with paul to be content in any estate philipp because howsoeuer the world go we haue our portion and treasure the second we must loue god in louing of man and serue him in doing seruice to man by the offices and duties of our callings they which labour in their callings for this end to get riches honours and to set vp themselues in this world prophane their callings and practise iniustice for not selfe loue but loue to god in duties of loue to man must beare sway in all our actions thus we see what it is to liue to god now we are all to be exhorted to order our liues in this manner for first of all we are god and therefore we must glorifie god both in our body and soules corinthian secondly the end of our iustification and redemption is that we may liue to god and it is great wickednes to peruert the order of god by liuing to our selues and the iusts of our hearts thirdly there be three degrees of life one is in this life a spirituall and a renewed life the second in death when the bodie goes to the earth and the soule to heauen the third in the last iudgement when bodie and soule reunited enter into the presence of god therefore that we may be saued we must liue vnto god in this life for we can neuer come to the second degree of life but by the first and we must not imagine that we can steppe immediatly out of a leud and wicked life into euerlasting happines in heauen lastly the grace of god in the ministerie of the gospel hath appeared and long taught vs and called vpon vs to liue vnto god therefore vnlesse we be ashamed and confounded for our sinnes and beginne with all speede to liue vnto god it will be worse with vs then with sodom and gomorrha and many other nation i am crucified with christ thus i liue yet not i any more but christ liues in me and in that i now liue in the flesh i liue by the faith of the son of god who hath loued me and giuen himselfe for me whereas paul said before i am dead to the law here he declares the reason of it when he saith i am crucified with christ againe here paul sets downe the true preparation to spirituall life for god first kills and then he makes aliue and the measure of spirituall life is according to the decay of originall sinne this preparation stands in two things the first is fellowship with christ in his crosse and passion in these words i am crucified with christ the second is ab egation or annihilation as some call it in these words not i any more i am crucified with christ for the better vnderstanding of these words we must obserue first that paul speakes not this of himselfe particularly but he speakes in the person of the christian iewes before whome he now reasoneth with peter nay in the person of all beleeuers for all that beleeue are buried into his death rom secondly it must be obserued that paul speakes this of himselfe not as he is a man consisting of bodie and soule but as he is a sinner carrying about him the bodie of sinne rom v further it may be demanded vpon what ground he should say i am crucified with christ ans there be two reasons of this speach one is that christ vpon the crosse stood not as a priuate person but as a publicke person in the roome place and stead of all the elect and therefore when he was crucified all beleeuers were crucified in him as in the parlament when the burgesse giues his voice the whole corporation is said to consent by him and in him the second reason is this in the conuersion of a sinner there is a reall donation of christ and all his benefits vnto vs and there is a reall vnion whereby euery beleeuer is made one with christ and by vertue of this vnion the crosse and passion of christ is as verily made ours as if if we had beene crucified in our owne persons hereupon paul saith in the time present i am crucified with christ there are like phrases in paul we are dead with christ we are risen with him we sit with him in heauenly places ephesians column and they are in the same manner to be expounded moreouer the benefits that arise of this communion with christ in his passion are two one is iustification from all our sinnes rom the second is mortification of sinne by the vertue of the death of christ after we are ingrafted into him thus much of the meaning the vse superstitious persons take occasion by the passion of christ to stirre vp themselues to sorrow compassion and teares by considering the pitifull handling of christ the sorrow that pearced the heart of the virgin marie and the crueltie of the iewes but this is a humane vse that may be made of euery historie the right vse is this we are in minde and meditation to consider christ crucified and first we are to beleeue that he was crucified for vs this beeing done we must goe yet further and as it were spread our selues on the crosse of christ beleeuing and withall beholding our selues crucified with him thou wilt say this is a hard matter i cannot doe it i say againe this is the right practise of faith striue therefore to be setled in this that the bodie of thy sinne is crucified with christ pray instantly by asking seeking knocking that thou maist thus beleeue this faith and perswasion is of endles vse first it is the foundation of thy comfort if thou beleeue thy selfe to be crucified with christ thou shalt see thy selfe freed from the dominion of the law and sinne from hell death and condemnation and to thy great comfort shall see thy selfe to triumph ouer all thy spirituall enemy for this christ doth column and thou dost the same if thou be setled in this that thou article crucified with him secondly vpon this perswasion thou shalt feele the vertue of the death of christ to kill sinne in thee and to raise thy dead soule to spirituall life when the sunamites child was dead elisha went and lay vpon him applying face to face hand to hand and foote to foote and then his flesh waxed warme and reuiued king euen so applie thy selfe to christ crucified hand to hand foote to foote heart to heart and thou shalt feele in thy selfe a death of sinne and the heat of spirituall life to warme and inflame thy dead heart thirdly if thou beleeue thy selfe to be crucified with christ thou shalt see the legth the breadth the height the depth of the loue of god in christ for thy sinnes are the swords and the speares that crucified christ and yet thou hast all the benefit of his passion lastly if thou canst beleeue that thou article crucified with christ thou shalt further be assured that he is partner with thee in all thy miseries and afflictions to ease thee and to make thee to beare them pet column the duties hence to be learned are these first if thou be crucified with christ then must thou applie thy heart to crucifie the bodie of corruption in thee by praier fasting by auoiding the occasions by abstaining fro the practise of sinne and by all good meanes behold a man hanged vpon a gybbet thou seest he hath satisfied the law and there is no further iudiciall proceeding against him and withall thou seest how he ceaseth from his thefts murders blasphemies euen so if thou canst behold thy selfe spred vpon the crosse of christ and crucified with him there will be in thee a new minde and disposition and thou wilt cease from thine old offences againe beeing crucified with christ thou must be conformable to christ in thy sufferings he suffered in loue and the more his passion increased the more he shewed his loue euen so in thine afflictions and sufferings thy loue to god amp man must be increased though man be the cause of thine afflictions secondly christ suffered in obedience not my will but thy will be done euen so in all thy sufferings thou must resigne thy selfe to god and quiet thy selfe in his will thirdly christ suffered in all humilitie humbling himselfe to the death of the crosse euen so we in and vpon our afflictions are to humble our selues vnder the mightie hand of god confessing our sinnes and intreating for pardon fourthly he suffered in faith as man depending on his fathers goodnes euen in the middest of his passion euen so are we to doe fifthly he went on constantly in his sufferings to the very death euen so are we to suffer in the resisting of sinne euen vnto the shedding of our blood lastly the principall care of christ was to see the fruit of his sufferings so when we are distressed our care must rather be to see the fruit of our distresse then to seeke deliuerance this conformitie with christ in his passion is an infallible worke and token of the child of god and a signe that we are crucified with christ againe here we are to take notice of the false faith of many man they can be content to beleeue that christ was crucified for them but there they make a pause for they doe not beleeue that they are crucified with christ their faith therefore is but halfe a faith and their profession is according for they haue the forme of godlines without the power thereof they thinke that they beleeue the articles of faith aright but they are deceiued for to beleeue in christ crucified is not onely to beleeue that he was crucified but also to beleeue that i am crucified with him and this is to know christ crucified lastly here we are to consider the abomination of the church of rome for it most abuseth that which is the greatest treasure in the world namely christ crucified for they make a very idol of him in that they worship him in at and before painted and carued crucifixes for there is no such christ in heauen or in earth that wil be present when we pray and heare vs at crucifixes againe they giue latria diuine honour to deuised and framed crucifixes and thus they robbe christ of his honour thus much of our communion with christ in his passion now followes the second part of preparation namely abnegation j liue yet not i any more that is i liue a spirituall life yet not as i as a naturall man for in that regard i carrie my selfe as a man crucified or after the manner of a dead man suffering nothing that is in me by nature to raigne in me that christ alone may liue and raigne in me here is a notable dutie to be learned we beeing crucified with christ must carrie our selues as man crucified and that in three respects first in respect of corruption of sinnefull nature for in regard of our sinnes we are to esteeme our selues vnworthie of meat drinke sleepe breathing yes we are to esteeme ourselues to be as vile as any of the creatures vpon earth and we are to denie vngodlines and worldly lusts not suffering any of them to raigne ouer vs secondly we must carrie our selues as dead man in respect of the good things that belong to nature as honours riches pleasures friends all which in respect of preparation of minde we must daily forsake for christs sake not suffering any of them to take place in our hearts lastly we must be as dead man in respect of our owne reason and will and we must tread them vnder foote making god will our wisdome and will and giuing it lordship and dominion ouer vs our owne wills in the meane season lying dead in vs thus are we to carrie our selues as dead man and we are to be carefull of it that god may haue pleasure in vs we must forget our owne people and our fathers house psalm that we may buy the pearle we must sell all we haue our wills our affections and the dearest things in the world he that would liue when he is dead must die while he is aliue and we must now lay out our selues as dead persons corruption of nature reason and will must be dead in vs that christ alone may liue and raigne in vs the third point concerning spirituall life is touching the originall and well spring thereof in these words that christ may raigne in me for the better conceiuing whereof three points are to be obserued the first that christ is not onely the author with the father amp the h ghost but also the roote of life hauing life in himselfe that he may conuaie it to all that beleeue in him he is the true vine and we are the branches ioh he is an appointed head to his church ephesians he is the prince of life act he is a quickning spirit corinthian and in this regard is he said to liue in vs namely as a roote in the branch or as the head in the members the second point is that there must be an vnion with christ before we can receiue life from him and he liue in vs if ye abide in me and i in you ye shall bring forth much fruit ioh we must be grafted with him before we can be conformable to his death and resurrection rom and againe we must be taken out of the wild oliue and set in the true oliue rom thus much paul signifieth when he saith christ liues in me of this coniunction two things must be noted the first that it is a substantiall vnion in that the person of him that beleeueth is vnited to the person of christ for we must eate the flesh of christ and drinke his blood before we can haue life abiding in vs ioh and our body are members of christ corinthian againe this vnion is spirituall because it is made by the bond of one spirit corinthian by one spirit we are baptised into one bodie and no man is to maruaile that we on earth should be ioyned to christ in heauen by ciuill contract man and wife are one flesh though distant many miles asunder why then may not we be ioyned to christ by vertue of the couenant of grace considering no distance of place can hinder the beeing of the spirit of christ in vs the third point is that after this vnion with christ he must further communicate himselfe vnto vs before we can liue by him and he in vs to this purpose s john saith that god hath giuen vs life that this life is in the son that he which hath the son hath life ioh for the conceiuing of this truth two questions may be demanded one in what order christ giues himselfe vnto vs ans christ first of all giues his flesh and blood that is himselfe and then secondly his gifts namely the efficacie and merit of his death the institution of the lord supper sheweth plainly that we are not partakers of the benefits of christ vnlesse first of all christ himselfe be giuen vnto vs the second question is how christ can be said to liue in vs ans he is not in vs in respect of locall presence but by the supernaturall and speciall operation of his spirit corinthian the operation of the spirit is threefold the first is when god imputes the righteousnes of christ to them that beleeue and withall giues the right of eternall life and the earnest of this right namely the first fruits of the spirit hereupon iustification is called the iustification of life rom the second is viuification by the vertue of the resurrection of christ philipp and this vertue is the power of the godhead of christ or the power of the spirit raising vs to newnes of life as it raised christ from the death of sinne and by this power christ is said to liue in them that beleeue the third is the resurrection of the dead bodie to euerlasting glorie in the day of iudgement rom thus then the meaning of the words is euident that christ as a roote or head liues in them that are vnited to him and that by the operation of his spirit causing them to die vnto their sinnes and to liue vnto god and againe it must be remembred that paul speakes this not priuately of himselfe but generally in the name of all beleeuers for he saith corinthian know ye not that christ is in you except ye be reprobates the vse hence it followes that they which are true beleeuers cannot make a practise of sinne and againe that they sinne not with the full consent or swinge of their wills because christ liues in them and restraines the will in part when they sinne therefore they sinne not of malice but of ignorance or infirmitie secondly the true beleeuer cannot wholly fall away from grace because the life of christ cannot be abolished as christ died but once and for euer after liues to god so they that are in christ die once to sinne and liue eternally to god rom the vertue and power of god that was shewed in raising christ to life is likewise shewed in quickning them that doe beleeue ephesians he therfore that is made aliue to god dies no more but remaines aliue as christ doth thirdly they which are true beleeuers are a free and voluntarie people obeying god as if there were no law to compell them for they haue christ to liue in them read psalm the spirit of life that is in christ is also in them and that is their law rom it is the propertie of the child of god to obey god as it is the nature and qualitie of the fire to burne when matter is put to it it may here be demanded how we may know that christ liues in vs ans by the spirit of god ioh and the spirit is knowne by the motions and operations thereof the first whereof is a purpose to obey god according to all his commandements that concerne vs with an inclination of our hearts to the said commandements paul saith he was sold vnder sinne and yet withall he addes that he delighted in the law of god according to the inward man rom he that loues god and keepes his commaundements hath the father and the son dwelling in him ioh let this be obserued pharaoh when god hand was vpon him confessed he was a sinner and his people and requested moses and aaron to let the people goe but after god had withdrawne his hand he returned to his old course the like doe sicke man they make promise to amend their liues and they request their friends to pray for them but when they are recouered they forget all their faire promises the reason is this there is conscience in them and by it they know themselues to be miserable sinners but they want this purpose to obey god and the inclination to his laws and therefore indeede they hate not their sinnes but rather the commandement of god the second operation and signe of the spirit is a mind and disposition like to the mind and disposition of christ which is to doe the will of god to seeke his glorie and to applie himselfe to the good of man in all duties of loue the third and last to omit many is to loue christ for himselfe and to loue them that loue christ and that because they loue christ this is a true signe that we haue passed from death to life ioh it may here be said how can christ be said to liue in vs considering we are laden with afflictions and miseries where christ liues there is no miserie ans in the middest of all miseries the life of christ doth most appeare where naturall life decaies there spirituall life takes place corinthian i beare in my bodie the mortification of our lord iesus that the life of iesus may be made manifest in me god power is made manifest in weaknes corinthian againe it may be said if christ liued in vs we should not feele so many corruptions as we doe ans the life of christ is conueyed vnto vs by little and little god hauing wounded and slaine vs first bindes vs vp then he revives vs and the third day he raiseth vs vp hos againe nature feeles not nature nor corruption feeles corruption but grace therefore it is the life of christ in vs that makes vs feele the masse and bodie of corruption furthermore here we are to take notice of the common sinne of our daies man will not suffer christ to liue in them and to rule ouer them it is reputed a small matter but it is a grieuous offence the gentiles say let vs breake their bands and cast their cords from vs psalm and it is was the sinne of the iewes to say we will not haue this man to raigne ouer vs luke and therefore christ saith bring them hither and slay them before me lastly here we learne our dutie and that is so to liue that we may be able to say with good conscience that christ liues in vs we must seeke his kingdome aboue all things and take his yoke on vs it will be said what must we doe that christ may liue in vs ans we must vse the meanes appointed meditation of the word prayer sacraments and withall we must spiritually eate the flesh of christ and drinke his blood ioh and that we may eate him we must haue a stomacke in our soules like the stomacke of our body and we must hunger and thirst after christ and therefore we must feele our owne sinnes and our spirituall pouertie and haue an earnest lust and appetite after christ as after meat and drinke when sisera was pursued by the armie of the israelites he cried to iael and said giue me drinke i die for thirst iudg euen so we beeing pursued by the sentence of the law by the terrours of hell death and condemnation must flie to the throne of grace and crie out saying giue me of the tree of life giue me of the water of life i perish for thirst then shall our wretched soules be quickned and reuiued to euerlasting life math reverand in the fourth place here is set downe the meanes of spirituall life in these words and in that i now liue in the flesh i liue by the faith of the son of god who hath loued me and giuen himselfe for me and that the doctrine may the better appeare i will stand a while to shew the meaning of them by flesh is ment the mortall bodie or the fraile condition of this temporall life heb and pet and therefore to liue in the flesh is to liue a naturall life by eating drink sleeping further paul saith that liuing in the flesh he liued by faith and for the better conceiuing of this two questions may be demanded the first is why a beleeuer is said to liue by faith ans there be two causes first faith is an instrument to vnite vs to christ and by meanes of this vnion we receiue life from christ for christ dwells in our hearts by faith ephesians secondly faith is a guide to order and gouerne temporall life in all good manner according to the will of god and this faith doth by a diuine kind of reasoning framed in the mind whereby it vrgeth and perswadeth to good duties rom the second question is how man liue by faith ans the child of god liues a double life in this world a spirituall and a temporall the spirituall stands specially in three things reconciliation with god renouation of life and good workes now in our reconciliation with god we liue in this world onely by faith for we haue and enioy pardon of sinnes imputation of iustice and acception to life eternall onely by meanes of our faith rom amp againe in the renouation and change of our liues we liue by faith for our faith in christ purifieth our hearts act partly by deriuing holines and puritie from christ vnto vs who is our sanctification and partly by moouing and perswading of vs to holines and newnes of life ioh lastly in the doing of euery good worke we must liue by our faith for first there must be a generall faith that the worke in his kind pleaseth god rom secondly iustifying faith must giue a beginning to the worke i beleeued therefore i spake psalm thirdly after the worke is done faith must couer the defects thereof that it may be acceptable to god heb temporall life stands in cares or miseries and miseries are outward afflictions or inward temptations and in all our worldly cares we are to liue by faith for our care must be to doe our office and the labour of our calling with all diligence this beeing done we must there make a pause and for the successe of all our praiers and labours we must cast our care on god pet likewise in our afflictions we are to liue by faith for our faith is to assure vs that god according to his promise will giue a good issue corinthian and though all temporall things faile vs it makes vs retaine the hope of mercie and of eternall life thirdly it makes vs waite god leisure for our deliuerance isa lastly in our temptations we are not to liue by feeling but by faith yes against feeling to rest on the bare promise of god when we feele and apprehend nothing but the wrath of god and thus we see how the beleeuer liues by his faith in this world it may be said what is the faith we liue by answer is here made it is the faith of the son of god and sauing faith is so called because christ is not onely the author of it and the obiect or matter of it but also the reuealer of it for there was a certaine faith in god which was put into the heart of man in the creation which also the morall law requireth but this faith in the messias was not knowne till after the fall and then it was reuealed to the world by the son of god againe it may be saide what is this faith of the son of god answer is here made a faith whereby i beleeue that christ hath loued me and giuen himselfe for me these words then thus explaned are an answer to an obiection which may be framed thus why shouldest thou say that thou liuest not but that christ liueth in thee considering thou liuest in the flesh as other man doe answer is made though i liue in the flesh yet i liue by the faith of the son of god the vse here first of all they are to be blamed that liue by sense like beast beleeuing no more then they see and trusting god no further then they see him for if a man whome we see and know make a promise to vs we are comforted yet if god who is inuisible make in his word farre better promises as he doth we are not in like sort comforted againe we put too much confidence in meanes if we haue good callings house land liuing we can then trust in god but when meanes of comfort faile we are confounded in our selues as if there were no god we are like the vsurer who will not trust the man but his pawne euen so we trust not god vpon his bare word without a pawne if he come to vs with a full hand and with the pawne of his good gifts and blessings we trust him els not againe they are to be blamed that liue onely by the guidance of reason for many dispute thus i deale truly and iustly with all man and liue peaceably with my neighbours therefore god will haue me excused but there must be a better guide to euerlasting life namely faith in christ els shall we misse of our marke thirdly they deceiue themselues that thinke they may liue as they list and call vpon god when they are dying and so die by faith it is well if they can die by faith but that they may so die they must liue by faith lastly they are to be blamed that spend their daies in worldly cares so as no good thing can take place this is the life of infidel and where true faith raignes it cuts off the multitude of cares and makes vs cast them on god moreouer here we see what we are to doe in perilous times as in the time of plague famine sword when present death is before our eyes we must then liue by faith when noeh heard of the flood he prepared such meanes as faith would affoard for the sauing of himselfe and his familie abraham isaac iacob by faith liued as pilgrimes in a strange land and were content moses left pharaos court and feared not the wrath of the king because by faith he saw him that was inuisible hebr dauid in the feare of present death comforted himselfe in the lord his god sam when iehosaphat knew not what in the world to doe he lift vp the eyes of his faith to the lord chronicle christ in his agonie and passion of the crosse by faith commended his soule into the hands of his father of the saints of the new testament some were racked some were stoned to death and that by faith heb we must therefore all of vs learne to liue by faith and for this cause we must acquaint our selues with the word and promises of god and mingle them with our faith els shall the life of a man in the world be worse then the life of a beast againe in these words who hath loued me and giuen himselfe for me the nature and propertie of iustifying faith is set down which is to applie the loue of god and the merit of the passion of christ vnto our selues and therefore the papists are deceiued who say that hope applieth and not faith it may be alleadged that paul speakes these words priuately of himselfe ans he speakes them in the name of all beleeuers iewes and gentiles for as we may see in the former verses that which concerned peter and the rest of christian iewes he applies to himselfe least his speech should seeme odious againe it may be obiected that all beleeuers cannot say thus christ hath loued me and giuen himselfe for me ans if the minde be fixed on christ and there be also a will and indeauour to beleeue and apprehend christ there is faith indeede for god accepts the true and earnest will to beleeue for faith we are not saued for the perfection of our faith but for the perfection of the obedience of christ which faith apprehendeth the israelites which looked vpon the brasen serpent with one eye or with a squint eye with halfe an eye or dimme sight were healed not for the goodnes of their sight but for the promise of god the poore in spirit are blessed now they are poore in spirit who finde themselues emptie of all goodnes emptie of true faith full of vnbeleefe and vnfainedly desire to beleeue so then if we greeue because we cannot beleeue as we should and earnestly desire to beleeue god accepts vs for beleeuers againe in these words who hath loued me and giuen himselfe for me s paul sets downe the reason or argument which faith vseth in the minde regenerate to mooue man to liue to god and the reason is framed thus christ loueth thee and hath giuen himselfe for thee therefore see thou liue to god read the like rom and and psalm by this we are to take occasion to consider and to bewaile the hardnes of our hearts who doe not relent from our euill waies and turne vnto god vpon the consideration of his loue in christ the water of the sanctuarie haue long flowed vnto vs but they haue not sweetned vs and made vs sauerie therefore it is to be feared least our habitations be at length turned to places of nettles and saltpits eze i doe not abrogate the grace of god for if righteousnes be by the law then christ died without cause the meaning grace in scriptures signifieth two things the free fauour of god and the gifts of god in vs and where the holy ghost intreates of iustification grace in the first sense signifies the good will and fauour of god pardoning sinnes and accepting vs to life euerlasting for the merit of christ tim ephesians and in this sense is the word vsed in this place and when paul saith i doe not abrogate the grace of god his meaning is i doe not make void or frustrate the grace of god in respect of my selfe or in respect of other beleeuers by teaching the iustification of a sinner by saith alone he addes if righteousnes be by the law that is if a sinner be iustified by his owne obedience in performing the law then christ died without cause the word freely translated without cause hath a double signification one is when it signifies as much as without price or merit math ye haue receiued freely giue freely the second is when it signifies rashly without iust or sufficient cause as psalm mine enemy hate me freely as the seuentie translate that is wrongfully or without iust cause thus here is christ said to die freely that is in vaine or without cause because if we be iustified by obedience to the law then christ died in vaine to make any satisfaction to the law for vs these words are an answer to an obiection the obiection is this if thou teach that a sinner is iustified onely by his faith in christ then thou abolishest the grace of god the answer is negatiue i doe not by this doctrine abrogate the grace of god and there is a reason also of this answer if we be iustified by our owne fulfilling of the law then christ died in vaine to fulfill the law for vs the vse first let vs marke that paul saith he doth not abrogate the grace of god and why because he will suffer nothing in the cause of our iustification to be ioyned with the obedience of the death of christ and hence we learne what is the nature of grace it must stand wholly and intirely in it selfe god grace cannot stand with mans merit grace is no grace vnlesse it be freely giuen euery way rom to him that worketh the wages is giuen not of grace but of desert rom if election be of grace then not of workes els is grace no grace grace and works of grace in the causing of iustification can no more stand together then fire and water by this we are admonished to be nothing in our selues and to ascribe all that we are or can doe to the grace of god againe here we see our dutie and that is to be carefull not to abrogate the grace of god vnto our selues but how is that done ans we must strippe and emptie our selues of all righteousnesse and goodnesse of our owne euen to the death and withall hunger and thirst after christ and his righteousnes math luke thirdly paul here sets downe a notable ground of true religion that the death of christ is made voide if any thing be ioyned with it in the worke of our iustification as a meanes to satisfie god iustice and to merit the fauour of god therefore the doctrine of iustification by workes is a manifest errour for if we be iustified by the workes of the law then the iudgement of the holy ghost is that christ died without cause againe the doctrine of humane satisfactions is a deuice of mans braine for if we satisfie for our selues then did christ by death satisfie in vaine thirdly it is a false and wicked though a colourable inuention to say that christ by his death merited that we should merit by our workes for if we merit by workes christ died in vaine to merit by his owne death this is the sentence of god who cannot erre lastly here we see the church of rome erreth in the foundation of true religion because it ioyneth the merit of mans workes and the merit of the death of christ in the iustification of a sinner and therefore we may not so much as dreame of any reconciliation to be made with that religion for light and darknes cannot be reconciled nor fire and water here the papists answer that paul in this text speakes against them that looked to be iustified by the naturall obseruation of the law without the death of christ but it is false which they say for paul here speakes against christian iewes who ioyned the law and the gospel and looked to be iustified both by christ and by the works of the law and not by workes of the law done by strength of nature but by works of grace o foolish galatians who hath bewitched you that ye should not obey the truth to whome iesus christ before was described in your sight and among you crucified that we may see how this chapter depends on the former we must repeat the principall argument of the epistle if i was called of god amp my doctrine be true then ye should not haue reuolted to an other gospel but i was called of god and my doctrine is true therefore ye should not haue reuolted to an other gospel the first part of the minor that paul was called of god was handled in the first and second chapters the second part that his doctrine is true is handled in the third fourth and fifth and is propounded in this verse moreouer the conclusion of the argument set downe chap v is here againe repeated namely that the galatians should not haue reuolted to an other gospel and withall paul here notes the causes of their reuolt and they are two one is follie o foolish galatians the other is the deceit of false teachers who hath bewitched you whereas paul saith o foolish galatians that we mistake not his example three questions may be demanded the first is in what respect he giues this hard iudgement against them ans three things are subiected to iudgement the doctrines of man the liues of man and the persons of man doctrines are to be iudged by the word and the liues of man yet ordinarily the persons of man are not to be iudged for the saying is true that three things are not subiect to iudgement the counsels of god the scriptures and the persons of man and in this place paul giues iudgement not against the galatians themselues or against their persons but against their new conceiued doctrin and against their practise in reuolting the second question is whether this iudgement be righteous and true iudgement ans it is because it is vpon good ground for first of all paul giues this censure by vertue of his calling because his office was to reprooue and correct vice tit and secondly it was in truth for indeede they ouerturned the passion of christ and therefore he could not call them lesse then fooles thirdly this iudgement was giuen in loue for paul intended and desired nothing in this speach but their good and amendment vpon like grounds isai calls the israelites people of sodome and gomorrha isa christ calls the two disciples foolish and slow of heart to beleeue luke paul calls the cretians lyers and slow bellies tit but matth may be obiected where he is said to be in danger of a councill that saith thou foole ans the place is to be vnderstood of them that charge man with follie with a mind to reproch them and in way of reuenge which paul in this place doth not the third question is whether we may vse like iudgement against man ans vpon like grounds we may if we haue a warrant and calling from god so to doe for all iudgement is god rom if this iudgement be in truth if it be in charitie for the amendment of the parties and for the good of others otherwise if these grounds faile vs we may not giue iudgement against any man but must follow the iudgement of charitie which thinks no euill hopes the best and construes all things in the best part corinthian to come to the second cause paul saith who hath bewitched you that is who hath deceiued you as if ye were bewitched by some inchantments here paul takes it for a confessed truth that there is witchcraft and witches and that we may the better conceiue his meaning two questions are to be propounded the first is what is the witchcraft here meant ans it is a satanicall operation whereby the senses of man are deluded for the deuill can by certaine meanes delude and corrupt the phantasie or the imagination and cause man to thinke that of themselues which is otherwise there is a disease called lycanthropia in which the braine beeing distempered man thinke themselues to be wolues and carrie themselues as wolues and in this disease the deuill hath a great stroke againe the deuill can delude the outward senses as the hearing and the sight thus iannes and iambres turned their roddes into serpents before pharaoh and brought frogges by deceiuing the eye and not in truth exod and thus the witch of endor made a counterfeit of samuel to rise out of the earth sam the second question is if this witchcraft be an operation of satan howmen should be said to doe it for paul saith who or what man hath bewitched you ans man doe it by league and confederacie with the deuill the inchanter charmes by ioyning societies psalm the deuill seekes whome he may deuoure and therefore where he finds a fit person to worke vpon he infinuates and offers himselfe and after man be in league with him he hath a word and sacraments for them as god hath and he requireth faith as god doth and looke as theeues some lie in the way some in the wood and they in the way when a bootie comes giue a watchword to the rest and then all are at hand together euen so when man in league with the deuill vse charmes imprecations curses praises superstitious inuocations according to his appointment and other satanicall ceremonies a watchword is likewise giuen vnto him and he is straight at hand to doe the intended feate thus and no otherwise are man said to bewitch or delude the eye that which paul saith to the galatians if he were now liuing among vs he would likewise say to vs o foolish nation who hath bewitched you we are wise in matters of the world but in matters concerning the kingdome of heauen the most of vs are fooles besotted and bewitched with worldly eares and pleasures without sense in matters of religion like a peece of waxe without all forme fit to take the forme and print of any religion and we must take heede least this our foolishnes and intoxication of our senses lead vs headlong to perdition and therefore we must learne the way of life in humilitie psalm we must obey it and in obedience we shall learne it ioh we must as heartily loue the word of god as in minde we conceiue it least by not louing of it we be giuen vp to strong illusions to beleeue lies thess lastly we must pray to god to be taught and guided by his word and spirit in things pertaining to euerlasting life to proceede further the delusion or bewitching of the galatians is set forth by two arguments the first is the ende in these words that ye should not obey the truth before i come to the consideration of these words a doubt must be resolued for some man may say that this epistle is corrupted because these words are wanting in sundrie translations and editions of the bible and ierome saith that they were not found in the copies of the bible in his daies ans in the editions and translations of the bible there are sundrie differences and diuersities of readings and these differences are not the fault of the scripture but of the man which vsed to write out the bible for the bible heretofore was spread abroad not by printing but by writing againe though in the bookes of the bible there be sundrie varieties of reading yet the prouidence of god hath so watched ouer the bible that the sense thereof remaineth intire sound and incorrupt specially in the grounds of religion and not the words principally but the sense is the scripture and that which i say appeareth in this text for whether these words be left in or put out the sense of the verse is one and the same these words that ye should not obey the truth are meant of the obedience of faith rom and and the obedience of faith is propounded vnto vs without adding detracting or changing and this the galatians did not for they added iustification by workes to the doctrine of paul touching iustification by faith alone by which addition they depraued the truth and shewed that indeede they beleeued not the truth here let vs obserue the scope of all the malice of the deuill and that is to hinder or ouerthrow our faith the first thing the deuill aimed at in our first parents was to ouerthrow their faith and to cause them to doubt of the truth of god word the first temptation wherewith our sauiour christ was assaulted was against his faith as he was man if thou be the son of god thou canst cause these stones in thy hunger to be made bread but thou canst not cause these stones to be made bread therefore thou article not the child of god the deuill desired to sift out all the faith of the apostles and to leaue in them nothing but the chaffe of vnbeleefe luke the deuill blindes the eyes of man that the light of the gospel of iesus christ may not shine vnto them corinthian this must teach vs that we must not onely hold and know the true religion for the time but also build our selues vpon our faith iud v and be rooted and stablished vpon our faith and religion column and the rather because it hath bin the manner of this nation wickedly to change religion with the times and that we may indeede be rooted vpon our religion we must not boast of the greatnes and strength of our faith but rather labour to see in our selues a sea of vnbeleefe heartily to bewaile it and to striue to beleeue and so to goe on from faith to faith the truth here mentioned is the heauenly doctrine of the gospel so called for two causes first because it is an absolute truth without errour it is a principle not to be called in question that the apostles and prophets in writing and preaching could not erre it may be said they were man as we are and therefore subiect to erre and be deceiued in iudgement ans iudgement is twofold one conceiued by the discourse of naturall reason the other conceiued by the apprehension of things reuealed by god in the first the apostles and prophets might erre and be deceiued as nathan and peter were in the second they could not because it was framed in them by the inspiration and instinct of the holy ghost and therefore they neuer erred either in preaching or writing the second cause why the gospel is called the truth is because it is a most worthie truth namely the truth which is according to godlines tit it may be said what is the truth and how shall we know it considering there be so many dissentions ans first make thy selfe fit to know and then shalt thou know the truth and thou shalt be fitted to know the truth if thou first of all giue thy selfe to obey it read the golden text ioh v obey and ye shall know the second thing whereby the delusion of the galatians is expressed is the signe thereof in these words to whome iesus christ was described ampc that is to whome i haue preached the doctrine of saluation by christ in liuely and euident manner euen as if christ had bin painted before your eyes and had bin crucified in or among you and this is a manifest token that the galatians were deluded because they could not acknowledge the truth whe it was set forth vnto them as it were in orient colours and where paul saith that christ was before described i referre it to the time before their reuolt here first we are to obserue the properties of the ministerie of the word the first that it must be plaine perspicuous and euident as if the doctrine were pictured and painted out before the eyes of man therefore the church of rome deales wickedly in keeping the scriptures in an vnknowne tongue for this is to couer that from the people which is to be painted before the eyes of their minds againe that kind of preaching is to be blamed in which there is vsed a mixed kind of varietie of languages before the vnlearned for this is a signe to vnbeleeuers corinthian and in this kind of preaching we doe not paint christ but we paint out our owne selues it is a by word among vs it was a very plaine sermon and i say againe the plainer the better the second propertie of the ministerie of the word is that it must be powerfull and liuely in operation and as it were crucifying christ within vs and causing vs to feele the vertue of his passion the word preached must pearce into the heart like a two edged sword hebr true prophecie iudgeth man discouereth the things of the heart and causeth man to to say the lord is within you corinthian the scepter of christ whereby he smiteth the nation is in his mouth isa that is in the ministerie of the word ier and it is the same ministerie which shaketh heauen and earth agg by this it appeaeeth that to take a text and to make a discourse vpon something in the said text shewing much inuention of wit and much reading and humane learning is not to preach christ in a liuely manner it will be said what then i answer with paul who is sufficient either for the speaking or doing of these things yet something may be shewed know therefore that the effectuall and powerful preaching of the word stands in three things the first is true and proper interpretation of the scripture and that by it selfe for scripture is both the glosse and the text the second is sauorie and wholesome do ctrine gathered out of the scriptures truly expounded the third is the application of the said doctrine either to the information of the iudgement or to the reformation of the life this is the preaching that is of power let all the sonnes of the prophets thinke vpon these things and studie to be doers of them furthermore two questions are here resolued the first is whether images be necessarie in the congregations of the people of god ans there are christian images and pictures and they are very necessarie and these images are sermons of christ and the right administration of the sacraments for in them christ is described and painted out vnto vs as for the painted and carued images of the papists we vtterly detest them as idols they alleadge that they are lay mens bookes but habakuk saith they are doctours of lies hab and where the liuely preaching of the word is there is no neede of them and therefore images were not established in churches in these west parts till after yeares as long as the church had golden teachers there were no wooden images but when golden teachers did degenerate and become wooden teachers then came both golden and wooden images it is further said why may not we paint christ in our churches with colours as with wordes in sermons ans the one the lord alloweth namely the description of christ in speach but the caruing or painting of images in churches and that for religious vse he condemneth exod the second question is whether there be now in the church of god any sacrifice or oblation of christ ans there is after a sort for there is a liuely representation of the passion of christ in the preaching of the word and in the administration of the lord supper as if christ were yet in crucifying and as though his blood were now distilling from his hands amp sides as for the sacrifice of the masse it is an abomination and a meere mockerie for there the priest when he saith accept these gifts ampc is become a mediatour betweene christ and god and the bodie and blood of christ is offered in an vnbloodie manner that is blood is offered without blood and the priest when he hath offered christ eates vp all that he hath offered yet for this damnable oblation many stand and the reason is because they are bewitched and inchanted with pretended shewes of fathers councells antiquitie succession ampc lastly here we learne what is the dutie of all beleeuers namely to behold christ crucified cant o daughters of sion behold your king but where must we behold him not in roodes and crucifixes after the popish manner but we must looke on him as he propounds himselfe vnto vs in the word and sacraments for thus is he the true obiect of our faith and how must we behold him by the eye of faith which makes vs both see him amp feele him as it were crucified in vs here note that implicit faith which is to beleeue as the church beleeues is a blind faith for by it we cannot contemplate and behold christ and the common fault is here to be noted whereby man neglect and passe by this contemplation of christ there is among vs the euill eye that deuoureth all it seeth there is the adulterous eye but where is the eye of faith to behold christ where is the force of this eye to be seee which maketh the thing which it beholdeth to be ours and vs like vnto it we loue to tricke and paint our body and some to set fine complexions on their faces and therefore complexions at this day are made a kind of marchandise but away with such vanities if ye loue to be painted i will tell you what ye shall doe the office of the ministers is to describe and paint out christ vnto vs let them paint christ crucified in the heart and set vp his image there and then shalt thou haue a fauourable complexion in the eye both of god and man that this contemplation of christ by faith may take more place and be the better practised consider the vse of it first by beholding christ crucified we see our miserie and wickednes for our sinnes are the swords and speares which haue crucified him zach secondly this sight brings vs true and liuely comfort for beholding christ crucified we see paradise as it were in the midst of hell we see the handwriting against vs cancelled coloss we see the remission of our sinnes written with the heart blood of christ and sealed with the same thirdly this sight of christ makes a vniuersall chaunge of vs the camelion takes to it the colours of the things which it seeth and are neere vnto it and the beleeuing heart takes to it the disposition and minde that was in christ crucified by viewing and beholding of christ this sight makes vs mourne and bleede in our hearts for our offences when we consider that christ was crucified for them and it makes vs loue christ when we consider the loue of god in christ crucified lastly this thing must be a terrour to all the vngodly for they haue no care to behold christ but by their leud liues they crucifie him and for this cause in the day of iudgement they shall see with heauie hearts christ to be their iudge whome they haue pearced revelation better therefore it is now in the day of grace to behold him with the eye of faith to our comfort then now to despise him and then to behold him to our euerlasting shame with the eye of confusion this onely would i learne of you receiued ye the spirit by the workes of the law or by the hearing of faith are ye so foolish that after ye haue begunne in the spirit ye would now be made perfect by the flesh the sense of the words when paul saith this would i learne of you he meets with the conceit of the galatians who thought themselues wise and the effect of his speech is this i haue called you fooles but it may be that you thinke your selues wise and me foolish well let it be so then with all your wisdome teach me and let me learne but one thing and that is by what meanes ye receiued the spirit touching the phrase receiued ye the spirit three things must be obserued the first that the spirit sometimes signifies the essentiall spirit of the father and the son as corinthian there is a diuersitie of gifts but one spirit sometimes againe it signifies the effects operations or gifts of the spirit as namely when flesh and spirit are opposed as in this text and further when it signifies gifts yet then the presence of the spirit is not excluded but included the second is that here the spirit signifies the spirit of adoption ephesians rom the third is that to receiue the spirit is not barely to receiue the gifts of the spirit as we are said to haue the sun in the house when we receiue the beames of the bodie of the sun beeing in heauen but in this receiuing there are two things one is that the spirit is present in vs the other that the same spirit testifieth his presence by his speciall opera tion and gifts of grace paul saith ephesians greeue not the spirit which is not meant of gifts but of the very person of the spirit and it must be remembred that the effects and gifts of the spirit presuppose the presence of the spirit by workes of the law we are to vnderstand the doctrine of iustification by the workes of the law by the hearing of faith is meant the doctrine of the gospel hearing beeing put for the thing heard namely preaching and faith for the doctrine of iustification by faith in christ crucified for faith signifies not onely the gift whereby we beleeue but also that which is beleeued in the third verse spirit signifies the operation of the spirit whereby the inward man is renewed and made like to god or againe the exercises of the inward man and flesh signifies outward things or actions that properly pertaine to the outward man as circumcision and such like thus corinthian flesh and the new creature are opposed and paul saith rom he is a iew that is a lew within in the spirit hauing the circumcision of the heart to begunne in the spirit is to beginne in godlines and religion inwardly in the exercises of the renewed heart the resolution in these words is contained the first argu ment whereby paul prooues the truth of his doctrine it is framed thus if ye receiued the spirit by my doctrine my doctrine is true and ye foolish that adde vnto it iustification by the workes of the law but ye receiued the spirit by my doctrine therefore it is true and ye deale foolishly that haue added to it iustification by workes the major or first proposition is not expressed but the proofe thereof in the third verse thus it is a point of extreame follie when ye haue begun in the spirit to end in the flesh therfore it is folly in you hauing receiued the spirit by my doctrine to adde any thing vnto it of your owne the vse when paul saith let me learne one thing of you he notes the fault of the galatians and of sundrie others who when they haue attained to a certaine measure of knowledge in god word are presently puffed vp with pride and often thinke themselues wiser then their teachers this was the fault of the corinthians corinthian and of sundrie in our daies who separate wholly from all our congregations presuming to know that which they neuer learned of their teachers that this ouerweening pride may not take place we must ioyne the knowledge of our selues with the knowledge of god word and mixe our knowledge with loue for loue edesies and bare knowledge swells the heart againe here when it is said receiued ye the spirit that is ye did not receiue the spirit by the workes of the law but by the hearing of faith here i say we see the difference betweene the law and the gospel the law doth not minister the spirit vnto vs for it onely shewes our disease and giues vs no remedie the gospel ministreth the spirit for it shewes what we are to doe and withall the spirit is giuen to make vs doe that which we are inioyned in the gospel here also we learne that the preaching of the gospel is necessarie for all man because it is the instrument of god to conferre the spirit whole peter was yet speaking the spirit of god fell vpon the gentiles act paul saith his ministerie is the ministerie of the spirit corinthian sauing the ministers and others tim and the most learned haue neede of this ordinance of god for suppose they haue knowledge sufficient yet haue they neede of the spirit of god to guide and gouerne them further let it be obserued what is the scope of all our hearing and teaching namely that we may receiue the spirit of god without which spirit we can doe nothing moreouer paul here sets downe an infallible argument whereby we may be assured that the scripture is the word of god for the scriptures in their right vse which is in reading hearing meditation haue the diuine and supernaturall operation of the spirit ioyned with them to comfort in all distresses and in the very pang of death and to conuert the heart of man making him in respect of righteousnes and holines like vnto god this priuiledge haue the scriptures isa and no word els lastly let vs here obserue the certen marke of true religion and that is that the preaching thereof conferres the spirit of adoption this doth not the pretended catholike religion of the papists it doth not conferre vnto man the spirit to assure them that they are the children of god because it teacheth that we are to be in suspence of our saluation againe by teaching humane satisfactions amp merits it ministreth the spirit of pride and presumption as also the spirit of crueltie amp not of meekenes for they of that religion commonly delight in blood and there haue bin no war or seditions or rebellions in europe for many ages but they of the roman religion haue bin at one ende of them when paul saith v beganne ye in the spirit ampc he teacheth a diuine instruction that true godlines and religion stands in the spirit that is the grace of the heart or in the exercises of the inner man whether we respect the beginning the middle or the accomplishment thereof the kings daughter is all glorious within psalm true worshippers worship god in the spirit ioh rom he is a iew that is a iew not without but within in the spirit in the circumcision of the heart rom god seruice and kingdome stands in iustice peace of conscience and ioy in the holy ghost rom he that is in christ must not know him in any carnall respects but be a new creature corinthian gal baptisme is not the washing of the spots of the flesh but the promise that a good conscience makes to god by this doctrine we see the fault of the world which for the most part placeth religion in ceremoniall performance of some outward duties the iewe vsed to come to god with sacrifices and to draw neere to him with his lippe his heart beeing farre from god the papist hath turned the apostolike and catholike religion into a masse of ceremonies borrowed partly from the iewes and partly from the gentiles and the multitude among vs place their religion in comming to the church in outward hearing in receiuing the sacrament in some kind of formall praying these things may not be condemned but the power and life of religion lies not in these things wherefore we must not stand vpon outward amp painted shewes but looke what thou article betweene god and thy selfe that onely article thou in religion thou praiest in the church but thou maist deceiue the world in this tell me dost thou pray at home dost thou pray in thine owne heart vnto god by the spirit of praier then thou praiest indeede if thou canst approoue thy heart vnto god for any act of religion then is it done indeede els not remember this furthermore paul here teacheth that our after proceedings in religion must be answerable to our first beginnings in the spirit and hence we may be aduertised of many things first here we must take notice of the follie of popish religion for it beginnes in god mercie and the merit of christ and it ends in our merits and satisfactions secondly we must take notice of the common sinne of our times for in the practise of our religion we are deceiued we are not now that which we haue bin twentie or thirtie yeares agoe for now we see the world abounds with atheists epicures libertines worldlings newters that are of no religion and sundrie that haue heretofore shewed some forwardnes beginne to faulter and stagger and to looke an other way this is not to begin and ende in the spirit but to end in the flesh we are betime to amend this fault least if our former zeale be turned to present lukewarmes god in in his anger spue vs out yong man must here be aduertised as they grow in yeares and stature so to grow vp in good things that both the first beginning and the after proceedings may be in the spirit thus did christ increase in grace as he increased in stature lastly aged persons that haue begunne in the spirit must looke that they grow vp in the graces of the spirit more then others that they may end in the spirit it is said of the angel of thiatira that his loue seruice and workes were moe at the last then at the first reu the same should be saide of all aged persons they which are planted in the house of god bring forth fruit in their old age psalm it is the commendation of the old man that by reason of his manifold experience he knowes the father more then others ioh it is the praise of anna that shee continually serued god in fasting and praier beeing yeares old when the outward man decaies the inward man should be renewed i speake all this the rather because aged persons are much wanting in this dutie for none commonly are so ignorant in the things of god as they they begin in the spirit but the affections of their hearts vsually end in the loue of this present world but they must be warned that as they goe before others in age so must they also exceede in the graces of the spirit we vse to say of children god make them good old man and it is well said an old man is to be regarded but specially a good old man who is more to be respected then twentie of younger yeares now aged persons when they grow in age and not in the spirit they loose their honour for age is a crowne of glorie when it is found in the way of righteousnes prov let them therefore pray with dauid forsake me not o lord in mine old age psalm haue ye suffered so many things in vaine if so be it be euen in vaine the interrogation haue ye is as much as ye haue because the question in this place counteruailes a speech affirmatiue and the wordes carrie this sense ye haue professed the gospel and ye haue suffered many afflictions for the same but now haue ye reuolted from the gospel and therefore all your former sufferings are void or in vaine the words if they be in vaine are a limitation or qualification of that which was saide before and they carrie this sense whereas i haue said that your sufferings are in vaine i speake it not simply but with some hope of your repentance which if it be then that which would be in vaine shall not be in vaine in this verse paul sets downe a second reason to prooue the proposition of his first argument on this manner if ye receiued the spirit by my doctrine then is my doctrine true and ye fooles in reuolting from it for by this meanes the things which you suffered well ye now suffer in vaine the vse when paul saith haue ye suffered ampc he signifies vnto vs the estate and condition of all beleeuers in this life that they must be bearers and sufferers the reason to this are we called pet for we are called to resigne all reuenge to god and therefore of our selues to be bearers and sufferers math resist not euill and we are called to imitate the passion of christ who suffered beeing innocent and beeing reuiled reuiled not againe moreouer it is for our good that we should beare and suffer pet and psalm it may be demanded what if my cause be good must i then suffer ans yes the better thy cause is the better are thy sufferings they are blessed that suffer for righteousnes paul commends himselfe by the multitude of his sufferings corinthian againe it may be demanded how long we must suffer ans euen to the shedding of our blood if it be for the resisting of sinne heb lastly it may be saide how shall we be able to doe this ans god is faithfull and will not lay on vs more then we shall be able to beare corinthian by this we are admonished not to make a reckoning in this world of pleasure and delight as though the gospel were a gospel of ease and as we vse to say a gospel made of veluet but euery one of vs must take vp his owne crosse luke if thou wilt be my disciple denie thy selfe take vp thy crosse that is the particular affliction and miserie which god laies on thee againe if in this world we must be sufferers by condition then in dissentions and differences we may neither giue nor take the chalenge but must be content to beare and put vp wrongs and abuses lastly in these daies of our peace we must looke for daies of triall and affliction for as yet we haue suffered little for the name of christ the haruest of the lord hath bin among vs more then fourtie yeares therefore no doubt the time of threshing fanning and grinding comes on that as the martyr said we may be good bread to the lord and that we may be able to suffer for the name of god we must pray for this gift at god hand for power to suffer is the gift of god philipp and we must obserue the commandement of god not to feare the terrours of man reu pet and for this cause we must as peter saith sanctifie god in our hearts beeing assured by our faith of the presence protection and prouidence of god when paul saith haue ye suffered so many things he shewes that we must endure manifold miseries in this life iacob said to pharao his daies were few and euill many are the afflictions of the righteous psalm christ saith take vp thy crosse euery day luke and thereby he signifies that euery new day that comes ouer our heads we must looke for a new crosse and for this cause it is not enough to be patient for a fit but we must shew all patience and long suffering and that with ioyfulnes column when paul saith haue ye suffered so many things in vaine he signifies that our sufferings are of great vse vnlesse our sinnes be the hindrance it may then be demanded what is the vse of our sufferings the papists answer that in our baptisme or first conuersion christ sufferings doe all amp abolish the whole fault and punishment but if we sinne after our conuersion then they say christs sufferings abolish the fault and the eternall punishment and our owne sufferings abolish the temporall punishment but this doctrine leslens and obscures the mercie of god and it must be obserued that paul holds all their sufferings to be in vaine that seeke remission of sinnes or iustification in any thing out of christ now we for our parts make fiue other vses of our sufferings first they serue for triall of man that it may appeare what is hidden in their hearts deut secondly they serue for the correction of things amisse in vs corinthian thirdly they serue as documents and warnings to others specially in publike persons thus dauid suffers many things after repentance for his murther and adulterie fourthly they are markes of adoption if we be content to obey god in them heb lastly they are the troaden and beaten way to the kingdom of heauen act when paul saith if they be in vaine we are to obserue his moderation he reprooues and terrifies the galatians yet so as he is carefull to preserue the hope of mercie in them and the hope of their amendment in himselfe the like hath bin the practise of the prophets ionas preacheth yet fourtie daies and niniuie shall be destroied but withall he addes it may be the lord will repent and turne from his fierce wrath ion peter saith to simon magus thou article in the gall of bitternes but withall he addes pray god that the thought of thy heart may be forgiuen thee act see the like ioel and amos and thus are ministers of the gospel to delay and qualifie their reproofes and censures he therefore that ministreth to you the spirit and worketh miracles among you doth he it by the works of the law or by the hearing of faith these words are a repetition of the second verse whence the exposition must be fetched the words and worketh miracles among you are added and they carrie this meaning that god gaue to the galatians not onely the spirit of adoption but also other extraordinarie gifts of the spirit as to speake with strange tongues to cure diseases and such like repetitions in scripture are not idle but of great vse and signifie vnto vs the necessitie of the thing repeated and the infallible certentie of it the substance therefore of this verse must carefully be remembred and that is this ye receiued the spirit by my doctrine therefore it is true and of god the argument is of great vse for by it we come to an infallible assurance of the certentie of the scriptures and of true religion deriued thence the galatians are now reuolted from pauls doctrine and they erre in the foundation and yet paul saith in the time present he that ministreth the spirit vnto you hence it appeares that falls of infirmitie in the child of god doe not vtterly extinguish the spirit but onely grieue or make sadde the spirit againe paul here teacheth that god is the onely and proper author of miracles for he that ministreth the spirit worketh miracles namely god a miracle is a worke aboue the strength of nature therefore it can be effected of none but the author of nature it may be obiected the apostles prophets and others had a gift to worke miracles iosua commanded the sun to stand ios and elijah commanded fire to come downe from heauen king ans god neuer gaue to any man power to worke and effect a miracle either mediately or immediately the gift was the faith of miracles the faith was grounded vpon reuelation and the reuelation was that god himselfe would worke such or such a miracle when they praied commanded or imposed hands man therefore properly are but the mouth of god and messengers to signifie what he will doe againe it may be obiected that the deuill can worke miracles ans he can worke a wonder or things extraordinarie in respect of the ordinarie course of nature thus he caused fire to fall from heauen and he caused vlcers to arise in the bodie of iob and that true vlcers and this he did by the force of nature better knowne to him then all the world but as for a true miracle that exceedes the strength of nature he cannot possibly doe it no not christ himselfe as man though he be exalted aboue all man and angels by this we see that they are deceiued who thinke that the deuill can make raine thunder and lightning indeede when the matter of raine and thunder is prepared by god he can hasten it and make it more terrible but raine and thunder he cannot make for that is indeede as much as any miracle againe it is a falsehood to thinke that alchimists are able to turne baser mettals into gold for it is a worke of creation to turne a creature of one kind into a creature of an other kind it is also as foolish to imagine that witches by the power of the deuill are able to turne themselues into catts and other creatures none can doe this but god that made the creature here againe we see the vse of miracles that is to confirme doctrine in the apostolike churches that their vse is further to confirme doctrine euen at this day it cannot be prooued lastly here in the galatians we see what an easie thing it is to fall from god from our faith and allegiance to him they were taught by paul they had receiued the spirit of adoption they were enabled to worke miracles and yet for all this they fall away to an other gospel they must be a looking glasse to vs in peace we are now constant but if triall shall come our frailtie shall appeare that our frailtie and weaknes may not be hurtfull to vs we must remember two rules one is not to haue a conceit of any thing in vs but to hold our faith and religion in feare as in the presence of god rom the second to take heede that there be not in vs an euill corrupt and dissembling heart for if our heart be naught our faith cannot be good heb as abraham beleeued god and it was imputed to him for righteousnes knowye therefore that they which are of faith are the children of abraham the words euen as abraham ampc haue reference to that which went before on this manner ye galatians receiued the spirit by my doctrine and my doctrine was the preaching of iustification of faith without workes which doctrine is like and sutable to the example of abraham who beleeued god and it was imputed for iustice here paul sets downe the second argument whereby he prooues the truth of his doctrine and it is framed thus as abraham was iustified so are the children of abraham abraham was iustified by iustice imputed and apprehended by faith verse therefore the children of abraham are thus iustified this conclusion is the principall question it is not here expressed but in the roome thereof a declaration is made who are the true children of god namely they that are of abraham in respect of faith that which is saide here of abraham is a maine ground concerning the iustification of a sinner in the bookes of the old and new testament therefore i will more carefully search the true interpretation of it some expound the words thus abraham beleeued god and the world reputed him for a good and vertuous man but if this be the right sense then paul is deceiued who brings this text to prooue the iustification of abraham not onely before man but also before god now vertue and goodnes which is in estimation among man is not sufficient to acquit and iustifie vs before god the second exposition is of the papists who by faith here vnderstand a generall faith whereby the articles of faith are beleeued and by imputation they vnderstand reputation wher by a thing is esteemed as it is indeede and they teach that faith is reputed for righteousnes because say they faith formed with charitie is indeede the iustice whereby a sinner is iustified before god but this exposition hath his defects and errours for first of all charitie is not the forme or life of faith but the fruit and effect of it tim the ende of teaching is loue out of a pure heart good conscience and faith vnfained it is obiected that as the bodie is dead without the soule so is faith without workes iam and therefore that workes are the life of faith ans s iames by faith vnderstands a pretended faith or the profession of faith as appeares by the words v though a man say he hath faith and v shew me thy faith now of this profession of faith workes are the life secondly this exposition makes faith or the act of beleeuing to be our whole and intire iustice before god whereas indeede if it be iustice it is but one part thereof and in the act of beleeuing loue cannot be included thirdly faith ioyned with charitie is not the iustice whereby a sinner is iustified for our faith and loue are both imperfect and faith is imputed for righteousnes without workes rom and therefore without charitie for this is charitie to keepe the commandements of god ioh paul saith that the righteousnesse whereby we are iustified is by or through faith philipp and therefore our iustice and our faith are two distinct things the third exposition is also from the papists that faith is reputed for righteousnes because it is reputed to be a sufficient meanes to prepare man to their iustification but this cannot be the sense of this place for this was spoken of abraham after he was iustified and therefore needed no preparation to iustification let vs now come to the true sense of the wordes in them i consider two things abrahams faith in these words abraham beleeued god and the fruit of his faith in these words and it was imputed to him for righteousnes touching his faith i consider three things the first is the occasion which was on this manner after the conquest of the heathen kings abraham was still in some feare in this regard the lord comforts him gen i am thy buckler and thy exceeding great reward but to this abraham replies i want issue and the lord answers i will make thy seede as the starres of heauen gen now then looke as god renewes and inlarges his promise to abraham so abraham renewes his faith and hereupon moses and paul say abraham beleeued god god doth not now inlarge his promises to vs as to abraham neuerthelesse the promises recorded in the bible are renewed to vs partly by preaching and partly by the vse of the sacraments and we accordingly are to renew our faith specially in the time of feare and danger the second thing is the obiect or matter of his faith and that is the multiplication of his posteritie it may be said how could abraham be iustified by such a faith ans the promise of the multiplication of his seede was a dependant of a more principall promise i am thy god all sufficient gen and i am thy exceeding great reward gen in this carnall seede abraham specially respected by the eye of faith the blessed seede of the woman he therefore beleeued the promise of a seede as it was a pledge vnto him of a thing more principall namely the fauour of god and as it was a meanes to effect the incarnation of the son of god in his example we are taught how we are to respect and vse earthly things we are to respect them as pledges of god fauour and to vse them as meanes to further vs to christ and to the attainment of our saluation the third point is the propertie of abrahams faith which was a faith against hope for he beleeued the promise of a seede when his bodie was halfe dead and sarai was barren in like sort we keeping true religion and good conscience must in all our temptations crosses miseries infirmities against reason sense and feeling beleeue the promise of remission of sinnes and life euerlasting in the effect and fruit of abrahams faith three things must be considered the first is what is meant by imputation to impute properly is a speach borrowed from marchants and it signifies to recken or to keepe a reckening of expenses and receipts thus paul saith philem if he haue done thee any wrong impute it to me that is set it on my reckening and this word is here applied to the iudgement of god because he is our soueraigne lord and we are his debters and he doth adiudge vnto man for their sinnes either pardon or punishment imputation in god is twofold one legall the other euangelicall legall is when god willeth and adiudgeth the reward to him that fulfilleth the law thus paul saith rom that the wages is imputed to him that worketh and that of debt euangelicall imputation is when god accepts the satisfaction of christ our suretie as a paiment for our sinnes in this sense is the word impute taken ten times in the chap to the rom and in the fame is it vsed in this place the second point is what is imputed and it was imputed that is faith faith here must be considered two waies first as a qualitie in it selfe and thus it is imperfect and consequently cannot be imputed to vs for our instification againe faith must be considered as an instrument or hand holding and receiuing christ and in this regard beleeuing is put for the thing beleeued and thus must this text be vnderstood it was imputed to him that is the thing which his faith beleeued was imputed to him by god for the act of beleeuing is not our iustice as i haue shewed the third point is what is meant by righteousnes ans that which is called in scripture the iustice of god which is sufficient to acquit a sinner at the barre of god iudgement thus then the sense is manifest abraham beleeued the promise of god specially touching the blessed seede and that which he beleeued namely the obedience of the mediatour the blessed seede was accepted of god as his obedience for his iustification it is obiected that the obedience of christ is to be imputed to none but to christ who was the doer of it ans it is to be imputed that is ascribed to him as to the author thereof and withall because he did performe it in our roome and stead and that for vs it is to be imputed to vs secondly it is obiected that works are also imputed as well as faith psalm phinees exequuted iudgement and it was imputed to him for righteousnes ans there is iustice of the person and iustice of the act iustice of the person is that which makes the person of man iust iustice of the act is that which makes the act of the person iust and not the person it selfe now the psalme speakes onely of the iustice of phinees action and the meaning of the words is this that god reputed his action as a iust action whereas man might happily condemne it this place therefore prooues not that workes are imputed for the iustification of any man thirdly it is obiected that imputed iustice was neuer known in the church till yeares after christ ans it is false bernard saith expressely death is put to flight by the death of christ and the iustice of christ is imputed to vs and againe the satisfaction of christ is imputed to vs againe sundrie of the fathers as augustine hierome chrysostom theodoret anselme entreating vpon the text of paul corinthian auouch that the iustice whereby we are iustified is not in vs but in christ and it is a receiued doctrine with them that a sinner is iustified by faith alone now faith alone presupposeth an imputation of iustice the vse hence it followes that there is no merit of mans works either in the beginning or in the accomplishment of our iustification for faith is imputed for iustice to him that beleeueth and worketh not rom againe by this we see there is but one iustification and that the second by workes whereby a man of a good man is made better is a meere fiction for iust abraham is not iustified by his good workes wherewith he abounded but after his first iustification faith still is imputed to him for righteousnes thirdly here we see what is that very thing whereby we are to appeare iust before god and to be saued and that is the obedience of christ imputed to vs of god and apprehended by our faith lastly here we see our dutie god sits as a iudge ouer vs he takes a reckening of vs for all our doings the law is an handwriting against vs to some he imputes their sinnes to some he remits them we therefore must come into the presence of god plead guiltie and acknowledge our selues to be as bankrupts and intreat him to graunt pardon to vs and to accept the satisfaction of christ for vs then will god not impute our sinnes but the obedience of christ for our iustification and accept him as our suretie in life and death the declaration of the conclusion followes in the verse and it shewes who are the true children of abraham the meaning of the words must first be considered to be of faith is to be of abrahams faith rom and to be of abrahams faith is to beleeue and applie the promise of righteousnes and life euerlasting by christ as abraham did and to rest in it for our iustification and saluation v they are said to be of works who doe the works of the law and looke to be iustified thereby therefore they are of faith who beleeue in christ amp looke to be saued and iustified thereby and they which thus beleeue with abraham are said to be his children it may be demanded how ans children of abraham are of two sorts some by nature some by grace by nature are they which are of abraham by the flesh or naturall generation as ismael was by grace all beleeuers are children of abraham and that three waies first by imitation in that abraham is set forth vnto vs as a patterne in the steppes of whose faith all true beleeuers walke rom secondly beleeuers are children of abraham by succession in that they succeede him in the inheritance of the same blessing thirdly they are children to him by a kind of spirituall generation for abraham by beleeuing the promise of a seede did after a sort beget them indeede properly the promise and election of god makes them children and abraham by his faith beleeuing the foresaid promise receiues them of god as his children in this regard beleeuers are called children of the promise rom and the seede that is of the faith of abraham rom now then the meaning of the text is that beleeuers though vncircumcised are the children of abraham it may be said what priuiledge is this ans great for the children of abraham are children of the couenant act and children of god rom the vse in this verse paul sets downe one thing namely the true marke of the child of abraham and that is to be of the faith of abraha here then marke first of all the iewes though descending of isaac are no children of abraham because they follow not the faith of abraham secondly the turks are no children though they plead descent from agar sometimes and sometime from sara tearming themselues agarens and saracens for they tread vnder foote the faith of abraham thirdly the papist will nothing helpe himselfe by the plea of antiquitie succession and vniuersall consent except he can shew some good euidence that he is of the faith of abraham which he cannot for this faith he hath corrupted as i haue shewed lastly our profession of abrahams faith partly in teaching and partly in hearing and in the vse of the sacraments is not sufficient to prooue vs the children of abraham for not euery one that saith lord lord shall enter into the kingdome of heauen math therefore we must labour to be indeede and in truth of the faith of abraham and to walke in the steppes of his faith and to this end we must do three things first we must haue knowledge of the maine and principall promise touching the blessing of god in christ and of all other promises depending on the principall and we must know the scope and tenour of them that we be not deceiued secondly we must with abraham beleeue the power and truth of god in the accomplishing of the said promises or in the working of our vocation iustification sanctification glorification rom thirdly we must by faith obey god in all things shutting our eyes and suffering our selues as it were to be led blindfold by the word of god thus did abraham in all things euen in actions against nature hebr but this practise is rare among vs for there are three things which preuaile much among vs the loue of worldly honour the loue of pleasures and the loue of riches and where these beare a sway there faith takes no place it will be said that faith is much professed ans faith was neuer more professed yet there was neuer lesse true faith for the common faith of man is a false faith for in some it is conceiued without the meanes of the word praier sacraments and in others it is seuered from the purpose of not sinning now faith conceiued without the true meanes and faith ioyned with the purpose to liue as we list is nothing but presumption and surely this is the faith though not of all yet of the most moreouer that which paul hath said of the children of abraham he prooues by the testimonie of the galatians in these words know ye therefore or ye know that is vpon the saying of moses in the former verse ye your selues know this to be a truth which i said marke here paul requires such a measure of knowledge in beleeuers that they must be able to iudge of the gathering of this or that doctrine out of this or that place of scripture this shewes the contempt of knowledge in these our daies to be great for most man reiect the preaching of the gospel and content themselues with the teaching and schooling of nature for the scripture foreseeing that god would iustifie the gentiles through faith preached before the gospel vnto abraham saying in thee shall all the gentiles be blessed so then they which are of faith are blessed with faithfull abraham against the argument in the two former verses a doubt or exception might be mooued on this manner we graunt that they which are of the faith of abraham are iustified as he was so they be iewes and not gentiles now this doubt exception or obiection paul remooues in these verses thus whe god said to abraham in thee shall all the gentiles be blessed he signified the iustification euen of the gentiles by faith therefore all that are of faith euen the gentiles are blessed of god as abraham was in the verse i consider three things the occasion of the speach of god to abraham namely god foreknowledge the manner of his speach the preaching of the gospel to abraham and the testimonie it selfe in thee ampc touching the occasion first it may be demanded whether this foreknowledge in god be a bare foreknowledge seuered from the will of god or no ans no god foreknowledge is in all things ioyned with his decree or will if god should foresee things to come and in no sort will or nill them there should be an idle prouidence christ was deliuered by the will and foreknowledge of god act and the iewes for their parts did nothing in the crucifying of christ but that which the hand and counsell of god had determined to be done act neither is god by this doctrine made the author of sinne for sinne comes to passe not from the will of god but according to his will in that he foresees euill and withall wills not to hinder the beeing of it and euill not hindred comes to passe againe it may be demanded in what order the foreknowledge of god stands to his will ans the foreknowledge of things that may possibly come to passe goes before his will the foreknowledge of things that shall certenly come to passe followes the will and decree of god for things come not to passe because they are foreseene but because they are to come to passe according to the will of god therefore they are foreseene now then because foreknowledge in god is ioyned with his will and is alwaies a consequent of it it is often put for the counsell will and decree of god as in this place in this text two things are to be considered of god foreknowledge the first is who or what foresees answer is here made the scripture foresees that is god foresees and the scripture records things foreseene by him hence it appeares that the writings of moses are the word of god for they foretell things to come yeares after as the calling and benediction of the gentiles in the seede of abraham in the same regard the writings of paul are the word of god for there he reueales and sets down in writing more then years after what was the intention of god when he said to abraham in thee shall all the gentiles be blessed the second point is what is foreseene answer is made that god iustifieth the gentiles that is god will as certely iustifie them in time to come as if he had then done it when he spake the words some teach that the predestination of god is his decree in which he purposeth to redeeme and iustifie all man of all ages and times so be it they will beleeue but i finde no such decree in the word here we see god decree is onely to iustifie all the gentiles in the last age of the world and thus the text of paul must be vnderstood god would haue all man to be saued tim namely all man or all the gentiles in the last age of the world and not all the gentiles of all ages and times in the next place the manner of the speech and testimonie of god must be considered in that he is said to preach the gospel to abraham here marke the antiquitie of the gospel and the markes of true religion which for his substance was known not onely to the apostles but also to the prophets and patriarks so ancient is the true way of life and the doctrine of iustification by faith without workes papists plead antiquitie for their religion but in vaine for the proper points and heads of their religion were taken vp since the daies of christ some yeares after some some some some a thousand and some yeares after the third point is the speach or testimonie it selfe in thee shall all the gentiles be blessed in thee that is in thy seede christ gen who is in thy loynes into whome the gentiles are ingrafted by faith and consequently into thee for they are the seede of christ isa who is the seede of abraham againe here it is said all the gentilis but gen abraham is called the father not of all but of many nation ans he is the father of many in respect of his fleshs and he is a father of all the gentiles in regard of his faith againe it is vsuall in scripture to put the word all for many rom and the benediction here mentioned comprehends all the spirituall graces of god as vocation iustification glorification ephesians v the vse in that the lord saith all the nation shall be blessed in abraham hence i gather that the nation of the iewes shal be called and conuerted to the participation of this blessing when and how god knowes but that it shall be done before the ende of the world we know for if all nation shall be called then the iewes againe that which was foretold to abraham is verefied in our eyes for this our english nation and many other nation are at this day blessed in this seede of abraham vpon the consideration of this we are admonished of many things first we are to giue to god great thankes and praise that we are borne in these daies for many prophets and great kings desired to see that which we see and could not obtaine it secondly we must euery one of vs in our hearts amend and turne to god and vnfainedly beleeue in christ that we may now in the acceptable day be partakers of the promised blessing the lord saith gen in thy seede all the nation of the earth shall be blessed or blesse themselues because they shall vse all good meanes that they may be filled with the blessings of god thirdly we must blesse all doe good to all and hurt none for we are heyres of blessings pet lastly we must here marke our comfort if we truly turne to god and beleeue in the holy seede of abraham all things shall goe well with vs god shall blesse them that blesse vs and curse them that curse vs gen the ninth verse is the conclusion of pauls answer and it is in effect and substance one and the same with v and it signifieth that all man that be of abrahams faith though otherwise forrainers and gentiles to abraham shall be partakers of the same blessing of god with him it may be said how shall we haue the same blessing when we haue not the like faith ans god respects not the greatnes of our faith so much as the truth of it and if faith erre not in his obiect that is if we make christ crucified our redeemer and ioyne nothing to him if there be further a will to beleeue and to apprehend christ with care and constancie to increase in faith and a purpose not to sinne god will accept this true and honest will for the deede for as many as be of the works of the law are vnder the curse for it is written cursed is euery one that continues not in all things written in the law to doe them in these wordes paul sets downe a second reason whereby he prooues that not onely the iewes but also the gentiles are blessed as abraham was by faith and the reason is drawne from the contraries thus they that are of workes that is that looke to be iustified by workes are vnder the curse therefore they that are of faith are blessed or iustified with abraham moreouer paul addes the proofe of this second reason in the next words and it is framed thus they which fulfill not the law are cursed they which are of works fulfill not the law therefore they are accursed whereas paul saith that they are vnder the curse that will be of workes we see the whole world almost walkes in the way of perdition it is a conclusion of nature that we must be saued and iustified by our works the young prince in the gospel said good master what must i doe to be saued the iewes would not be subiect to the iustice of god but they est blished their owne righteousnes of the law rom our common people and they that should be wise say they looke to be saued by faith but indeede they turne their faith to workes for what is their faith surely nothing els as they say but their good meaning or their good dealing or their good seruing of god hence againe it followes that the papacie or popish reli gion is the way to perdition in that it prescribeth and teacheth iustification by workes on the contrarie our religion is the safest and surest from daunger because it teacheth the free iustificatio of a sinner by the blood of christ and this makes the papists in the day of death to renounce iustification by their workes steuen gardiner a bloodie persecutor beeing on his death bed told of free iustification by the blood of christ said you may tell this to me but doe not open this gappe to the people one of late in a publike execution of iustice said he would die a catholike and withall he added that he looked to be saued onely by the passion of christ in the proofe of the reason three things are to be considered what the curse is who are cursed and when the curse is eternall woe and miserie and it is either in this life in the end of this life or in the life to come the curse in this life is either within man or without him the curse within man is manifold in the minde there is ignorance of god of our selues of true happines and of the means to attaine to it againe there is a great difficultie with much paine to learne and retaine things to be learned and retained and this is a curse of god vpon our minds in the conscience there are manifold accusations terrours and feares arising vpon euery occasion and they are flashings as it were of the fire of hell vnlesse they be quenched in this life by the blood of christ in the will there in an inclination to all manner of sinnes without exception againe there is hardnes of heart whereby the will of man is vnpliable to that which is good vnlesse it be renewed in the bodie there are more diseases then the physitians bookes can expresse and as many diseases as there be in vs so many fruits of sinne there are ioh the curse without vs is threefold the first is a spirituall bondage vnder the power of the devil who by reason of sinne works in the hearts of vnbeleeuers ephesians and hath the power of death heb the second is an enmitie of all the creatures with man since the fall and this appeares because when god receiues vs to be his people he makes a couenant with all creatures in our behalfe hos the third containes all losses calamities miseries in goods friends good name read deut the curse in the end of this life is death which is the separation of bodie and soule rom and death in his owne nature is a fearefull curse and the very downefall to the pitte of hell the curse after this life is the second death which is separation of bodie and soule from god with a full apprehension of the wrath of god and if the paine of one tooth or finger be oftentimes so great that man rather desire to die then liue how great then shall the paine be when all the parts of bodie and soule shall be tormented and the eternitie of this death increaseth mans miserie if a man might suffer so many yeares as there are drops in the sea and then haue an end it were some comfort but when that time is expired man is as farre from the end of his woe as euer he was this in summe and substance is the curse here mentioned and it were to be wished that man would more thinke amp speak of it then they doe then would there be more conscience of sinne the next point is who are cursed ans they which doe not all things written in the law here is an item for them that will keepe some commandements but not all herod would doe some things at the motion of john baptist but he would not leaue his incestuous marriage with his brothers wife mark there be at this day that are very forward in good things yet some of them will not leaue their swearing some their lying some their vncleannes some their vsurie but god will not part stakes with man he will haue all or none he that breakes one commandement is guiltie of all iam and there is good reason that he which obaies should obey in all for where god renewes he sanctifies throughout and fills them with the seede of all grace that they may performe obedience according to all the commandements of the law againe he is cursed that doth not all things which the law prescribeth or if he doe them yet doth not continue in all so then he is cursed that breakes the law but once and that onely in one thought for such an one doth not continue in all things now then o sinnefull man what wilt thou doe to auoid the curse for thou hast in thought word and deede broken the law doest thou thinke to appease the wrath of god with gold and siluer the whole world and all things therein are the lord and thou maist not thinke to hide or withdraw thy selfe from the presence of god for all must come and appeare before his tribunall seat in their owne persons neither may we thinke to escape because god is mercifull for he is as iust as mercifull what wilt thou then doe to escape this horrible curse when thou hast done all thou canst doe thou canst no way helpe or releeue thy selfe the onely way of helpe is this thou must flie from this sentence of the law to the throne of grace for mercie instantly asking seeking knocking at the gate of mercie for pardon of thy sinnes and that thou maist be incouraged to this dutie consider with me that at thy first purpose to amend and to turne vnto god thy sinnes are pardoned in heauen dauid saith psalm i thought i will confesse my sinnes against my selfe and thou forgauest me marke the speech i thought the prodigall child luke vpon his purpose to returne to his father before he had indeed humbled himselfe in word was receiued to mercie when dauid said i haue sinned nathan in the name of god said thy sinne is forgiuen thee it may be thou wilt say the curse is absolute ans the threatnings of the law must be vnderstood with an exception which the gospel makes on this manner the law saith cursed is the transgressour and the gospel saith except he repent ionas preached yet fourtie daies and niniuie shall be destroied yet withall he addes an exception it may be the lord will repent of his fierce wrath ion againe thou wilt say my sinnes are very grieuous therefore i feare i shall not escape the curfe ans forgiuenes is promised without any limitation to any number or kinds of sinne onely the sinne against the h ghost excepted therefore appeale with boldnes in thy heart to the throne of grace intreat for forgiuenes as for life and death and thou shalt escape the curse the third point is when is a sinner accursed ans in present in the time of this life for the lord saith not he shall be accursed but he is accursed there be among vs whome no sermons or exhortations will amend and such persons thinke themselues without the reach of any danger for they thinke the time is very long to the last iudgement but they are deceiued touching themselues for god with his owne mouth hath giuen the sentence that they are accursed there remaines nothing but the exequution the halter is alreadie about their neckes and there remaines nothing but the turning of the ladder nay the exequution is alreadie in blindnes of minde and hardnes of heart he that beleeues not is alreadie condemned ioh lastly a memorable conclusion of paul is here to be obserued that it is impossible for any man within himselfe for the time of this life to fulfill the law of god for paul here takes it for a confessed and graunted conclusion otherwise his argument will not hold which must be framed on this manner he which fulfills not the law is cursed he which is of workes fulfills not the law therefore he is accursed i further prooue it thus if we could fulfill the law we might be iustified by the law but no man can be iustified by the law or by workes therefore no man can fulfill the law againe paul saith rom that the law was spirituall requiring inward and spirituall obedience and that he was carnall and therefore not conformable to the law that he was sold vnder sinne that when he would doe good evil was present that he carried about him the bodie of death and all this he saith of himselfe about twentie yeares after his owne conuersion such as our knowledge is such is our loue to god and man now we know god onely in part therefore we loue in part and consequently we doe not fulfill the law againe the scripture puts all man euen the regenerate vnder the name of sinners to the very death isa all our righteousnes is as a defiled cloth prou who can say my heart is cleane iob cannot answer god for one of a thousand iob the righteous man shall pray for the pardon of his sinnes in a time when he may be heard psalm if we say we haue no sinne we deceiue our selues ioh the papists say that all these places are meant of veniall sinnes ans there are no veniall sinnes which in their owne nature are not against the law of god but only beside it the stipend of euery sinne is death rom if we were perfectly sanctified and consequently fulfillers of the law in this life then christ should not be a sauiour but an instrument of god to make vs our owne sauiours and to say this is blasphemie lastly that which man could doe by creation so much the law requires at our hand but man by creation could loue god with all the powers of his soule and with all the strength of all the powers which now since the fall no man can doe it remaines then for an infallible conclusion that it is impossible for any man in the time of this life to fulfill the law the vse this point serues notably to condemne the follie of the world the israelites say at mount sinai that they will doe all things which the lord shall command them exod the young prince said that he had kept all the commandements from his youth mark our common people say that they can loue god with all their hearts and their neighbours as theselues secondly this doctrine serues to confute sundrie errours of the papists who blasphemously teach that a man after justification may fulfill the law in this life that a man may for a time be without all sinne that works of the regenerate are perfect and may be opposed to the iudgement of god that man may supererrogate and doe more then the law requires the groud of all these conclusions is this they say there is a double degree of fulfilling the law the first is in this life and that is to loue god truly aboue all creatures and to loue our neighbour as our selues in truth the second is to loue god with all the powers of the soule and with all the strength of all the powers and this measure of fulfilling the law is reserued to the life to come i will briefly consider the reasons and the ground of this blasphemous doctrine obiect i god promifeth the israelites that he will circumcise their hearts that they may loue him with all their hearts with all their soules and with all their strength deut and thus iosua turned to god with all his heart with all his soule and with all his strength according to all the law of moses king ans the phrase with all thy heart is taken in a double signification sometime it is opposed to a double heart and then it signifies a true and vpright heart without guile or dissimulation thus they of zebulon are saide not to fight with a double heart chronicle but with a perfect heart v where marke the opposition of an whole or perfect heart to a double heart in this sense are the places before named to be vnderstood neuerthelesse the whole heart soule and strength in the summe of the morall law signifies all powers of the soule and all the strength of all the powers thus doth paul rom expound the law when he faith the law is spirituall and by the prohibition of lust giues the meaning of the whole law for concupiscence or lust comprehends the first thoughts or motions obiect ii noah is saide to be iust and perfect gen and god commands abraham to walke before him and to be perfect gen paul saith let as many as be perfect be thus minded philipp answer there is a double perfection perfection of parts and perfection of degrees perfection of parts is when a man hath in him after he is regenerate the beginnings of all vertnes and the seedes of all graces by which he endeauours to obey god in all his lawes and commandements perfection of degrees is when the law is fulfilled both in matter and manner according to the rigour of the law now the former places speake onely of the perfection of parts and that is such a perfection in which we are to acknowledge our imperfection and it is no more but a true and generall indeauour to obey god isa obiect iii sundrie holy man are saide to fulfill the law dauid turned from nothing that god commanded him all the daies of his life saue in the matter of vriah king zachary and elizabeth walked in all the commandements of god and that without reproofe before god luke ans there are two kinds of fulfilling the law one legall the other euangelicall legall is when man doe all things required in the law and that by themselues and in themselues thus none euer fulfilled the law but christ and adam before his fall the euangelicall manner of fulfilling the law is to beleeue in christ who fulfilled the law for vs and withall to indeauour in the whole man to obey god in all his precepts and this indeauour ioyned with the purpose of not sinning is called the righteousnes of good conscience and though it be not really a fulfilling of the law yet it is accepted of god as a fulfilling of the law in all the that are in christ for god accepts the indeanour to obey for perfect obedience thus dauid zachary elizabeth and others are said to fulfill the law obiect iiii we pray that we may fulfill the law when we say let thy will be done in earth as it is in heauen ans we pray not that we may fulfill the law in this but that we may striue as much as may be to attaine to the fulfilling of the law that is the scope of the petition we desire not to be equall to the angels and saints but onely to imitate them more and more and to be like to them obiect v rom to will is present with me therefore say they in will the law may be kept though the flesh relent ans when paul saith that to will was present he doth not signifie that he could perfectly will that which is good for his will beeing partly renewed and partly vnrenewed the good which he willed he partly nilled and the euill which he nilled he partly willed obiect ui christ tooke out flesh that the righteousnes of the law might be fulfilled in vs rom ans the righteousnes of the law is fulfilled in vs not because we doe all things required in the law but because we haue faith in vs and by that faith we apprehend the obedience of christ in fulfilling of the law obiect vii rom loue is the fulfilling of the law and the regenerate loue their neighbours ans if we could loue our neighbour as our selues perfectly we should then fulfill the whole law but our loue is imperfect obiect uiii he that is borne of god sinnes not ioh he that sinnes not fulfills the law ans he that is borne of god sinnes not that is he doth not commit sinne or make a practise of sinne he may fall of frailtie yet then he recouers himselfe and doth not keepe a course in sinning this is the meaning of s john obiect ix the commandements of god are not grieuous ioh ans they are not grieuous three waies first in respect of remission because they that beleeue in christ haue the transgression of the law pardoned secondly in respect of imputation because christs obedience in fulfilling the law is imputed to euery beleeuer thirdly in respect of inchoation for they that beleeue receiue the spirit of god wherby they are inabled to indeauour themselues to obey god in all his commandements otherwise in respect of our owne personall obedience they are a yoke that no man can beare obiect x the workes of god are perfect deut good workes are workes of god therefore they are perfect ans workes that are meerely workes of god which he worketh by himselfe and not by man they are all perfect and thus must the text in moses be vnderstood now good works are works of god in vs and withall they are our workes hauing their beginning in the minde and will of man and hence they are defiled for when the first and second cause concurre in a worke the said worke takes vnto it the condition of the second cause water pure in the fountaine is defiled when it passes by the filthie channell obiect xi if god haue giuen vs an impossible law he is more cruell then any tyrant ans when god first gaue the law he also gaue power to fulfill the law if the law be impossible it is not god fault but mans who by his owne fault hath lost this power of keeping the law the ground before named of the double fulfilling of the law one for this life the other for the life to come is false for there is onely one generall and vnchangeable sentence of the law cursed is euery one that continues not in all things written in the law to doe them i now come to other vses of the former conclusion if the law be impossible then must we seeke for the fulfilling of it forth of our selues in christ who is the ende of the law for righteousnes to them that beleeue hence it followes necessarily that our iustification must be by the imputation or application of christs iustice vnto vs because we cannot fulfill the law we must make it a glasse to see our impotencie and what we cannot doe and it must be our schoolemaster to driue vs to christ and by our impotencie we must take occasion to make praier to god for his spirit to inable vs to obey the lawes of god thus come we to be doers of the law and no otherwise againe it may be demanded considering we cannot fulfill the law how our works can please god ans in euery good worke there is something that is god and something that is ours alone the defect of the worke is ours alone and that is pardoned to the beleeuer that which is good in the worke is from god and that he approoueth as beeing his owne and thus euery good worke is said to please god lastly after that we haue begunne to please god in obedience to his lawes considering we fulfill them not all boasting of our goodnes must be laid aside and we must humble our selues vnder the hand of god euen to the death read the practise of dauid psalm and psalm iob and that no man is iustified by the law in the sight of god it is manifest for the iust liueth by faith and the law is not of faith but he that shall doe these things shall liue in them the meaning by the law that is the law not onely ceremoniall but also iudiciall and morall indeede the occasion of pauls disputation in this place is taken from circumcision pertaining to the ceremoniall law but he inlarges his disputation from one part to the whole law for they which thought ceremonies necessarie to iustification would much more thinke morall duties necessarie and that paul speakes here of the morall it appeares by the verse where he alleadgeth a sentence that specially appertaines to the morall law cursedis euery one ampc againe the law may be considered two waies in the iustification of a sinner first as it iustifieth without christ secondly as it iustifieth with christ and both waies it is excluded from iustification and here specially in the second regard for the intent of the galatians was to ioyne christ and the law in the worke of our iustification before god that is in the iudgement of god before whose iudgement seat we must all appeare and be iudged the iust shall liue by faith the scope of these words is this the iewes were oppressed by the babylonians and it was further told them by the prophet that they should be ledde into captiuitie by the saide babylonians now in this distresse of theirs the lord sets downe the dutie of the faithfull iewes namely that they must stay themselues by their faith in the messias and consequently that they shall haue safetie in this life in the middest of all dangers and in the ende haue eternall life and paul applies this text to his purpose thus life eternall comes by faith and therefore true righteousnesse before god is by faith for righteousnes is the foundation of life eternall and therefore it is called iustification of life rom the law is not of faith the meaning of these words must be gathered by the opposition in the latter part of the verse but he that doth these things shall liue in them and the meaning is this the law doth not prescribe faith in the messias neither doth it promise life to him that beleeueth in the messias but to him that doth the things contained in the law in these wordes paul addes a new argument to the former thus iustice is by faith the law is not of faith therefore the law is not our iustice or again thus he that is iustified is iustified by faith the law iustifies no man by faith therefore the law doth not iustifie the conclusion is first in the verse the proposition is expressed and confirmed by the testimonie of the prophet habacuk the assumption is in the verse the vse whe paul saith no ma is iustified by the law in the sight of god he makes a double iustification one before god the other before me iustification before god is when god reputes a man iust amp that onely for the merit and obedience of christ iustification before man is when such as professe faith in christ are reputed iust of man by this distinction paul who saith that a man is iustified by faith without workes rom and iames who saith that abraham was iustified by faith and workes iam are reconciled for paul speakes of iustification before god as he himselfe expressely testifieth rom and s iames speakes of iustification before man which is not onely by the profession of faith but also by workes in the same sort there is a double election one speciall whereby god knowes who are his the other is more generall whereby we repute all man to be elect that professe faith in christ leauing secret iudgements to god thus paul writes to the ephesians philippians ampc as elect and the ministers of the word are to speake to their congregations as to the elect people of god in the same manner there is a double sanctification one before god in truth ephesians the other before man in the iudgement of charitie thus man are said to tread vnder foote the blood of christ wherewith they were sanctified hebr thus all that are of right to be baptised are holy and regenerate not in the iudgement of certentie which is god but in the iudgement of charitie which is mans secrets alwaies reserued to god againe when paul saith in the sight of god he giues vs to vnderstand that there is an vniuersall iudgement of god before whome we must all appeare and be iudged and when paul saith in the time present that god iustifieth though not by workes he signifies that this iudgement is alreadie begunne vpon vs euen in this life this must teach vs to walke in godly and holy conuersation in the feare of god and to watch and pray that we may be found worthie to stand before god malefactours when they are going to iudgement and when they see the iudge set lay aside skorning and bethinke themselues what to say or doe now we are these malefactours and we know that god hath alreadie begunne to giue iudgement of vs and therefore we must prepare our selues to make a good reckoning in the testimonie of the prophet our dutie is set downe and that is that we must in this world liue by faith that we may liue by faith we must doe two things one is to choose the true god for our god the second is in our hearts to cleaue vnto him and that according to his word first therefore we must cleaue fast to his commandements by entring into the way of his precepts and by walking in them for this cause we must haue alwaies about vs the eye of knowledge to direct our steps in the wayes of god that we euer keepe our selues in our callings that is the dutie we owe to god and man secondly while we stand in the waies of god we shall be assailed with many temptations on the right hand and on the left therefore we must further cleaue to the promises of god beleeuing his presence protection and assistance in all temptations and daungers and this our faith must be as it were a hand to stay vs here two caueats must be remembred one that we must not prescribe vnto god the manner of his assistance but leaue it with other circumstances of time and place to god the second is when all earthly things faile vs we must rest vpon the bare word of god and beleeue the promise of remission of sinnes and life euerlasting this is to liue by faith and this dutie must be practised when we are in the field to fight for our countrey when we lie on our death beddes and when we are in any danger marke further paul saith the iust man liues by faith he therefore that is iustified continues to be iustified by his faith and therfore the second iustification that is said to be by our works is a meere fiction and in that none liues by faith but he that is a iust man we see that true faith is alwaies ioyned with the purpose of not sinning or with the iustice of good conscience and where they are seuered there is no more but a meere pretence of faith when paul saith the law is not of faith he sets downe the maine difference betweene the law and the gospel the law promiseth life to him that performs perfect obedience amp that for his works the gospel promiseth life to him that doth nothing in the cause of his saluation but only beleeues in christ and it promiseth saluation to him that beleeueth yet not for his faith or for any worke els but for the merit of christ the law the requires doing to saluation and the gospel beleeuing and nothing els obiect i the gospel requires repentance and the practise of it ans indeede the law doth not teach true repentance neither is it any cause of it but onely an occasion the gospel onely prescribes repentance and the practise thereof yet onely as it is a fruit of our faith and as it is the way to saluation in which we are to walke and no otherwise obiect ii the law requires and commands faith ans the law requires faith in god which is to put our affiance in him but the gospel requires faith in christ the mediatour godman and this faith the law neuer knew obiect iii in the gospel there are promises of life vpon condition of our obedience rom jf by the spirit ye mortifie the deedes of the flesh ye shall liue ioh if we confesse our sinnes god is faithfull to forgiue them ans the promises of the gospel are not made to the worke but to the worker and to the worker not for his work but for christs sake according to his worke as for example promise of life is made not to the worke of mortification but to him that mortifieth his flesh and that not for his mortification but because he is in christ and his mortification is the token or euidence thereof and therefore it must be remembred that all promises of the gospel that mention works include in them reconciliation with god in christ obiect iv faith is a vertue and to beleeue is a worke therefore one worke is commanded in the gospel and is also necessarie to saluation ans the gospel considers not faith as a vertue or worke but as an instrument or hand to apprehend christ for faith doth not cause effect or procure our iustification and saluation but as the beggers hand it receiues them beeing wholly wrought and giuen of god this distinction of the law and the gospel must be obserued carefully for by it we see that the church of rome hath erroniously confounded the law and the gospel for this many hundred yeares the law of moses say they written in tables of stone is the law the same law of moses written in the hearts of man by the holy ghost is the gospel but i say againe that the law written in our hearts is still the law of moses and this ouersight in mistaking the distinction of the law and the gospel is and hath bin the ruine of the gospel we must here further obserue that cr dere fac beleeuing and doing are opposed in the article of our iustification in our good conuersation they agree faith goes before and doing followes but in the worke of our iustification they are as fire and water hence i gather that to the iustification of a sinner there is required a speciall and an applying faith for generall faith is numbred among the works of the law and the deuills haue it this kind of beleeuing therefore and doing are not opposite againe hence i gather that works of faith and grace are quite excluded from iustification because the opposition doth not stand betweene beleeuing and the works of nature but simply betweene beleeuing and doing lastly it may be demaunded why the lord saith he that doth the things of the law shall liue considering no man since the fall can doe the things of the law ans the lord since mans fall repeates the law in his old tenour not to mocke man but for other waightie causes the first is to teach vs that the law is of a constant and vnchangeable nature the second is to aduertise vs of our weaknes and to shew vs what we cannot doe the third is to put vs in minde that we must still humble our selues vnder the hand of god after we haue begunne by grace to obey the law because euen then we come farre short in doing the things which the law requires at our hands christ hath redeemed vs from the curse of the law when he was made a curfe for vs for it is written cursed is euery one that hangeth on the tree that the blessing of abraham might come to the gentiles through christ iesus that we might receiue the promise of the spirit by faith paul hauing prooued the truth of his doctrine by sundrie arguments in the former part of this chapter he here answereth an obiection the occasion whereof is from the verse it may be framed on this manner if they be accused that continue not in all things written in the law to doe them then all man are accursed and the gentiles are not partakers of the blessing of abraham as you haue said answer is here made that to them that beleeue there is full redemption from the curse of the law and paul for the better inlightning of his answer here makes a description of our redemption by foure arguments the first is the author christ hath redeemed vs from the curse of the law the second is the forme or manner of our redemption in these words when he was made a curse for vs and this forme is further declared by the signe in these words for it is written cursed is euery one that hangeth on the tree the third argument is in the end in these words that the blessing of abraham might come on the gentiles the last is also an other ende that we might receiue the promise of the spirit touching the author in these words christ hath redeemed vs from the curse of the law sundrie things may be learned first of all comparing these words with the verse or comparing the answer and the obiection together we see and are to obserue that the threatnings of the law are to be vnderstood with an exception from the gospel all are cursed saith the law that doe not continue to doe all things written therein except they haue pardon and be redeemed by christ saith the gospel and thus are all curses of the law to be conceiued with a limitation or qualification from the gospel againe in that christ hath redeemed vs from the curse of the law here is our comfort that neither hell nor death nor sata hath any right or power ouer vs so be it we do vnfainedly beleeue in christ for we are bought with a price and for this cause we must be admonished not to feare any euill ouermuch as the reuilings and curses of euill tongues withcraft the plague pestilence famine the sword or death for the curse which makes all these and many other things hurtfull vnto vs is remooued from them that are in christ and therefore all immoderate feare should be restrained thirdly our dutie is to glorifie god and christ who hath redeemed vs and that both in bodie and soule the redeemed must liue according to the will of their redeemer corinthian this is all the thankfulnes that we can shew to our redeemer for his mercie lastly here an obiection made by some may be answered if say they we were redeemed by christ beeing captiues to the deuill the price of our redemption was paid to him and not to god ans we were captiues properly to the iustice of god in the law to the order whereof we stand subiect and by this meanes we are captiues to the curse of the law and consequently to the deuill who is the minister of god for the execution of the said curse and beeing captiues to the deuill no otherwise then as he is the minister of god for the inf cting of punishment the price must not be paid to him but to god who is the principall and hath a soueraigntie ouer him and vs i come now to the forme of our redemption who was made a curse for vs for the better vnderstanding of these words foure points are to be handled the first is what is this curse ans a double death the first of the bodie the second of the soule the first is the separation of the bodie and soule the second is the separation of the whole man from god not in respect of his vniuersall power and presence for the very damned haue their moouing and beeing from him but in respect of his fauour and speciall loue whereby god ceaseth to be their god and this is death indeede whereof the first is but a shadow and this is the curse of the law the second point is how christ was a curse or accursed who is the fountaine of blessednes ans he is not so by nature for he is the naturall son of god nor by his owne fault for he is the vnspotted lambe of god but by voluntarie dispensation and therefore paul saith he was made a curse and he was made a curse first because he was set a part in the eternall counsell of the father son and holy ghost to be our redeemer and consequently to be a curse in this regard the father is said to haue sealed him ioh and he is said againe to be prcordained before all worlds pet and giuen according to the counsell and foreknowledge of god act secondly he was made a curse in that he was in time consecrated to be our mediatour and so a curse and this consecration was first in his baptisme in which he put vpon him our guilt as we put off the same in ours and secondly on the crosse and passion in which he tooke vnto him the punishment of our sinne and thus was he made a curse it may be obiected that he is the son of god and therefore no curse ans christ must be considered as the son of god and againe as our pledge and suretie heb in the first respect he was not accursed but in the second the third point is in what nature was christ accursed ans whole christ god man or man god was accursed for the lord of life saith paul was cr cified and consequently accursed corinthian yet this limitation must be added that the curse was not vpon the godhead of christ but onely in his flesh or manhood for he suffered saith peter in the flesh pet moreouer the soule of christ was the more principall seat of the curse as it was the principall seat of sinne therefore the prophet saith he made his soule an offer for sinne isa and christ said my soule is heauie to the death the fourth point is how farre forth christ was accursed ans in the first death there are two degrees separation of the bodie and soule and the putrifaction of the bodie separated and christ entred onely into the first and not into the second for his bodie beeing dead indured no corruption againe in the second death there are two degrees the first is a separation from god in sense and feeling and the second is an absolute separation from god into this second degree of death christ entred not because he saide in the middest of his passion my god my god and this absolute separation could not be without the dissolution of the personall vnion into the first degree of the second death he entred namely into the apprehension and feeling of the wrath and indignation of god due to mans sinne and this appeares by his bloodie sweat of thicke and clottered blood by his complaint that he was forsaken by his feares and sorrowes in the time of death in which he comes short of sundrie martyrs vnlesse we acknowledge that he indured further paines of death then euer they did by his condition in that he takes vpon him the condition of the first adam who vpon his fall was to indure the first and second death here two questions are to be demanded the first how and in what manner christ suffered the wrath of god ans he indured it willingly of his owne accord he did not onely in minde see it before his eyes but also he felt it it was laid and imposed on him and he incountred with it but it had no dominion of lordship ouer him act the second is how much he suffered of the wrath of god ans the punishment he suffered was in value and measure answerable to all the sinnes of all the elect past present and to come the godhead supporting the manhood that it might be able to beare and ouercome the whole burden of the wrath of god if it be saide that a creature cannot haue an infinite apprehension of the wrath of god i answer it sufficeth that god laid infinite wrath vpon him and that he apprehended it according to the condition of a creature for in so doing he incountred with the whole wrath of god one man in a breach or at a bridge may stand against an whole armie and beare the brunt of it why may not then the manhood of christ supported by the godhead beare the stresse of the whole wrath of god against this doctrine sundrie things may be obiected obiect i the scripture ascribes all to the blood of christ and therefore to the death of the bodie ans by blood is meant a bloodie death by the bloodie death the death of the crosse by the death of the crosse a death accursed or the death of the bodie ioyned with the malediction of the law obiect ii the suffering of the anger of god was not figured in sacraments or sacrifices ans the beast whereof the burnt offer was made was first tied to the hornes of the altar his blood then was shedde and lastly he was all burnt vpon the al vnto god and hereby was figured the fierie wrath of god obiect iii temporall death or the curse for halfe a day cannot counteruaile eternall death ans yes in christ for if man could suffer and ouercome punishment in measure infinite he should not suffer eternally but this no man nor angel can doe and therefore man must suffer punishment for measure finite for time infinite because the punishment must be answerable to god whose maiestie is infinite now christ beeing god and man suffered punishment indeed infinite and therefore it was not necessarie that he should indure it eternally againe here the dignitie of the person helpeth for in that the son of god suffered the curse of the law for halfe a day it is more then if all man had suffered eternall death therefore the death of christ in respect of the measure of the punishment as also in respect of the value and dignitie thereof counteruailes death euerlasting obiect iv it is hard to say that christ suffered the paines of hell ans the latin translation commonly receiued hath as much that he could not be holden of the sorrowes of hell act and there is no offence to say he suffered the paines of hell so farre forth as this suffering may stand with the puritie of his manhood and with the truth of the personall vnion the vse friers teach that if christ had pricked his finger and let fall but one droppe of blood it had bin sufficient to redeeme all the world but they dreame for paul saith he was made the curse of the law to redeeme vs this had bin a needles worke if a pricke in the finger or any punishment without death would haue done the deede that christ became a curse for vs it shewes the greatnes and horriblenes of our sinnes it shewes the grieuous hardnes of our hearts that neuer almost mourne for them it shewes the vnspeakable loue and mercie of god for which we are to be thankfull for euer and that all manner of waies in that the son of god became a curse for our sinnes we are put in minde to see acknowledge and consider them and withall to bewaile them and to humble our selues for them and to detest them more and more vnto the very death for what is more worthie of hatred then that which causeth the son of god to be accursed they which beleeue that christ by beeing a curse hath redeemed them from the curse of the law doe in truth die vnto all their sinnes and liue vnto god many indeede professing christ make no change of life at all and the reason is because a secret atheisme makes them say in their hearts there is no christ there is no curse that was indured by christ clense your hearts of this hidden atheisme and looke that inwardly in your spirits you die vnto your sinnes and liue to god in that christ was obedient to his father in bearing the curse of the law we are taught in all things to subiect our selues to the will of god our obedience must not onely be in doing this or that but also in suffering the miseries d on us to the death this is the best obedience of all and the truest marke of god child to obey in our sufferings moreouer that christ was accursed it is confirmed by the sentence and decree of god cursed is euery one that hangeth on the tree deut the ground of this sentence is the sinne of the malefactour for whome god curseth he curseth for his offence and here it may be demanded why he that is stoned to death is not likewise accursed ans he also is accursed but there are speciall reasons why the man hanged on the tree is cursed first among the iewes they which were hanged were most grieuous malefactours as blasphemers and idolatours and there punishment was accordingly most grieuous secondly hanging as among all nation so among the iewes was a most odious and infamous death thirdly god did foresee that the messias should die on the crosse and therefore he accursed this kind of death if it be saide that there was no fault or offence in christ and therefore he could not be accursed i answer that he became sinne for vs in that our sinne was applied and imputed to him it may be further obiected that the theefe which repented was not accursed though he were hanged on the tree ans as a theefe he was accursed as he was a theefe and repented the curse was remooued for the law in the curses thereof giues place to the gospel iudgement yeelds to mercie and the gospel puts an exception to the law the vse if the malefactour hanged be accursed and defile the earth how vile and accursed is the liuing malefactour the blasphemer adulterer murtherer ampc who hath entred no degree of punishment let this be considered to terrifie offenders againe let vs consider the scope of this law because he that hangs on the tree is accursed therefore saith the law of god he must be taken downe and buried marke the equity of this law and that is that things euill and accursed are to be remooued from the eye and sense of man this charge the lord giues of lesse matters namely of sights vndecent and vnseemely deut againe we are commanded not so much as to name fornication vncleannes couetousnes resting foolish talking ampc ephesians here we are to be put in minde that the plaies commonly in vse ate to be banished out of all christian societies for they doe nothing els but reuiue and represent the vile and wicked fashions of the world and the misdemeanour of man which are things accursed and therefore to be buried and not once to be spoken of againe all euill in our example whether in word or in deede must be buried as much as may be for it defileth and is accursed here it may be demanded how this law of god he is accursed therefore let him be taken downe and buried standes with the order vsed in this and other country in which man are hanged in chaines for the terrour of the world ans iudiciall lawes if they haue in them morall equitie and serue directly to fense in the precepts of the decalogue are perpetuall and bind all man els not as for the iudiciall determinations of this or that manner of punishment they concerne vs not but god hath left euery nation free though not in respect of punishment yet in respect of the manner and order thereof the third point whereby our redemption is described is the ende thereof that the blessing of abraham that is righteousnes and life euerlasting may come vpon the gentiles here two things are to be considered the first is whence comes the benediction of abraham ans from the cursed death of christ for thus are the words he was made a curse for vs that the b ediction of abraham might come on the gentiles marke here how god workes one contrerie by the other in the creation he made something not of something but of nothing he called light out of darknes he kills and then makes aliue hos he sends man to heauen by the gates of hell he gaue sight by a temper of spittle and clay a fit meanes to put out sight in the worke of our redemption he giues life not by life but by death and the blessing by the curse this shewes the wisdome and power of god and it teacheth vs in the worke of our conuersion and saluation not to goe by sense and feeling because god can and doth worke one contrarie in and by the other the second point is where this benediction of abraham is to be found ans the text say it is extant in christ iesus who is as it were the storehouse of god blessing and the dispenser of it to all nation in him are hid all treasures of wisdome and knowledge column god and the lambe are all things to all the elect in the kingdome of heauen reu here we see the right way to become rich and that is aboue all things to seeke to be true and liuely members of christ for if he be ours we can want nothing rom matth psalm this is a most sure way to procure vnto vs all good things that he sees to be necessarie for vs for christ is the storehouse of the benediction of abraham againe this must teach them that beleeue in christ to be content in any estate be it better or worse for true riches is the blessing of god and this blessing is in christ this is the truth if we could discerne of things that differ thirdly in our pouertie and in the middest of all our wants and losses we must comfort our selues for though we leese neuer so much yet we retaine the principall and that is christ who is the benediction of abraham the fourth point is an other end of our redemption that we might receiue the promise of the spirit by faith for the better vnderstanding of this foure questions may be demanded the first is what is meant by the promise ans the promise of god made in the old testament that he would powre out his spirit vpon all flesh isa and ioel and h saide that this promise is fulfilled to the nation whe they beleeue marke here how the promises of god lie as void dead and of none effect till the particular time of their accomplishment god promiseth iacob that his posteritie shall be a great nation after yeares for which time they remaine in thrall amp bondage but the very night after the former time was expired nothing no not the raging sea could stoppe their deliuerance exod god promised deliuerance after yeares captiuitie to the israelites in babylon when this time was expired daniel praied and at the very beginning of his supplications the decree of god for deliuerance came forth daniel the vision of god saith the prophet is for an appointed time hab and so is the promise this must teach vs to be content if after much praying we finde not the fruit of our praiers because there is an appointed time for the accomplishing of them in this respect dauid saith that his eyes failed and he was hoarse in praying psalm the second question is what is meant by the giuing or sending of the spirit ans without any alteration or change of place it signifies two things the first is order betweene the persons whereby the father and the son worke mediately by the holy ghost amp the holy ghost immediatly from them the second is that the spirit doth manifest his presence by diuine effects in vs in this respect he is saide to be sent or giuen of the father and the son the third point is in what order is the spirit giuen for it seemes that we first of our selues beleeue and then receiue the spirit ans man are saide to receiue the spirit when they receiue some new gift of the spirit or the increase of some old gift ioh againe to speake properly faith and the receiuing of the spirit are for time both together for first of all we heare the promise of god then we beginne to meditate and to applie the saide promise to our selues to striue against doubting and to desire to beleeue and in doing of all this we receiue the spirit to beleeue is the first grace in vs that concernes our saluation and when we beginne to beleeue we beginne to receiue the spirit and when we first receiue god spirit we beginne to beleeue and thus by our faith receiue we the spirit and thus also the spirit dwells in vs by faith ephesians and we must not imagine that we may or can beleeue of our selues without the operation of the spirit the fourth point is for what ende we receiue the spirit ans for sixe for illumination of our mindes ioh corinthian for regeneration whereby the image of god is restored in vs ioh for the gouernment of our counsells wills affections actions isa rom for the effecting of that coniunction whereby we are vnited to christ our head corinthian for consolation rom lastly for confirmation in our faith and euery good dutie corinthian ephesians this receiuing of the spirit is one speciall ende of our redemption and therefore it is most necessarie for vs to haue the spirit of god dwelling in vs if we haue not the spirit we are not christs and without it we can doe nothing we must for this cause doe such things whereby we may obtaine and receiue a plentifull measure of god spirit repent saith peter and ye shall receiue the holy ghost againe we must carefully retaine and preserue the grace of the spirit in vs by meditation in the word of god by earnest and frequent praier by auoiding all such acts in word or deede that may make a breath in conscience for whatsoeuer offends conscience quenches the spirit lastly by sauouring the things of the spirit rom that is by thinking on things spirituall by affecting of them and delighting in them brother i speake as man doe though it be but a mans couenant when it is confirmed no man doth abrogate it or adde any thing thereto now to abraham and his seede were the promises made he saith not and to the seedes as of many but and to thy seede as of one which is christ and this i say that the law which was yeares after cannot disanull the couenant that was before confirmed of god in respect of christ that it should make the promise of none effect for if the inheritance be of the law it is no more by promise but god gaue it vnto abraham by promise in these words paul meetes with a second exception or obiection made against that which he here principally stands vpon namely that the blessing of abraham is conuaied to the gentiles and that by christ the obiection may be framed thus the promise made to abraham cannot now pertaine to the gentiles because the law was added to it and by the law it is abrogated and therefore the gentiles are to be iustified and faued by the obseruation of the law to this obiection paul makes a double answer one is that the promise cannot be abrogated the second that if it might be abrogated yet the law cannot doe it the first he confirmes on this manner the testament of god confirmed cannot be abrogated the promises made to abraham and his seede which is christ are his testament confirmed therefore they cannot be abrogated the testament of god confirmed cannot be abrogated the promises made to abraham and his seede which is christ are his testament confirmed therefore they cannot be abrogated the proposition is expressed in the verse and is confirmed by comparison thus the testament of man after it is confirmed may not be abrogated much lesse the testament of god v the minor is propounded in the and verses now i come to speake of the words as they lie brethreu paul had before called them fooles and that iustly because they fell from the doctrine which he taught them to an other gospel and yet here he calls them brother and hence let vs learne that in diuision of iudgement and opinion there must be no diuision but vnitie of affection it is and hath bin alwaies the plague of the church that diuision of heart and affection there takes place where any diuision is in iudgement though man erre of infirmitie this cuill causeth more to be condemned for heretikes then indeede ought to be it maketh schismes where none should be it maketh dissentions to be incurable which otherwise might be cut off and therefore if dissentions in iudgement arise we must remember to suppresse envy hatred pride selfe loue and let christian loue beare sway againe here we see it is lawful to speake in sermons as man doe so it be done after the example of paul with these cautions first it must be done sparingly and soberly without ostentation secondly it must be done vpon a iust cause as when the sayings of man serue to conuince the hearers and that in their consciences thirdly a difference must be made betweene the word of man and the word of god least in adding one to the other the word of god loose his grace and excellencie lastly god word onely must be the foundation of the doctrine which is taught and the word of man is to be added in respect of our infirmitie to giue light or to conuince that which paul speakes after the manner of man is a principle of law or a conclusion of the light of nature namely that a couenant or testament confirmed may not be abrogated paul saith it is the propertie of them that are of reprobate mindes to be truce breakers rom hence sundrie questions may be resolued the first is whether legacies giuen to the maintenance of the masse may be applied to the maintenance of the true worship of god ans the testator in the giuing of such legacies hath a double intention one is general and that is to preserue the worship of god the other is special and that is to preserue the idolatry of the masse in this he erreth and therefore his will may be changed for testaments vnlawfully made may be abrogated in the generall he erred not and therefore the goods may lawfully be applied to the maintenance of the true worship of god but it may be saide that the next heires may recall them when the masse is abolished i answer no because they may still be applied to the publike good of the church the affection of the dead was good in this case though there iudgement was naught and therefore regard is to be had of their affection and intent the second question is whether we are to keepe couenant with heretikes and enemy ans yes for the principle a couenant confirmed may not be abrogated is the conclusion of nature which binds all man without exception at all times if the couenant be lawful the third question is what if damages and losses follow vpon the couenant made and confirmed must it then be obserued ans of couenants some are single that is bare promises not confirmed by oath and some againe are with oath againe some couenants are meere ciuill beeing made of man to man and some are more then ciuill beeing made of man to god as contracts of marriage now if couenants be single couenants and meerely ciuill then may they be changed by the makers or by their successours if hurts and losses arise yet if couenants be confirmed by oath and if they be made to god they may not be changed so long as they are lawful though great losses insue read the example of iosua ios a good man sweareth and changeth not though he lose thereby psalm the fourth question is whether a contract may not be dissolued when one of the parties hath a disease contagious in deadly manner and incurable ans if such a disease follow the contract the marriage not consummate we may presume that god doth dissolue the contract and the couenant dissolued by god we may without daunger hold to be abrogated the last question is whether the church of rome hath not dealt wickedly in altering the last testament of christ when it ministreth the lord supper vnder one kind ans they sinne against the light of nature which teacheth vs not to abrogate the testaments of man much lesse the testament of god it is alleadged that we receiue whole christ vnder one kind ans true indeede but we must consider the end of the sacraments is to signifie and represent perfect nourishment in and by christ now perfect nourishment is not in bread alone but in bread and wine and by them both ioyned together is signified that christ is the bread and the water of life now to abolish the cuppe is to abolish the principall vse of the sacrament and to lessen our comfort in the verse paul saith the promises were made to abraham in the plurall number because they were sometime made to abraham sometime to his seede and sometime to both and they were often repeated to abraham and therefore are called promises though in substance they are but one the seede of abraham here mentioned is the seede not of the flesh but of the promise rom and this seede is first christ iesus and then all that beleeue in christ for all these are giuen to abraham as children by the promise and election of god moreouer this seede is not many as paul obserueth but one that is one in number it is obiected that the word seede is a name collectiue and signifies the whole posteritie of abraham ans it doth sometime but not alwaies for eue saith of seth god hath giuen me an other seede gen that is an other son lastly it is said that this one particular seede of abraham is christ iesus here by the name christ first and principally the mediatour is meant and then secondly all iewes and gentiles beleeuing that are set and grasted into christ by their faith for paul saith rom that the children of god or the children of the promise are the seede of abraham againe gal they which are of christ are the seede of abraham and the name christ signifies not onely the head or mediatour god and man but also the church gathered partly of iewes and partly of gentiles the bodie saith paul is one but the members are many euen so is christ corinthian that is the church of christ againe i beare in my bodie the remainders of the sufferings of christ column and the church is called the complement of christ ephesians it may be obiected that by this means the seede of abraham is many and not one because christ and all beleeuers are the seede ans they are all one in respect of one and the same blessing of god which is first giuen to christ and by christ to all that beleeue in him all are one in christ gal and he gathers things in heauen and earth into one head ephesians it is here to be obserued that the promises made to abraham are first made to christ and then in christ to all that beleeue in him be they iewes or gentiles this conclusion is of great vse first by it we learne the difference of the promises of the law and the gospel the promises of the law are directed and made to the person of euery man particularly the promises of the gospel are first directed and made to christ and then by consequent to them that are by faith ingrafted into christ secondly by this we learne to acknowledge the communion that is betweene christ and vs christ as mediatour is first of all elected and we in him christ is first iustified that is acquit of our sinnes and we iustified in him he is heire of the world and we heires in him he died vpon the crosse not as a priuate person but as a publike person representing all the elect and all the elect died in him and with him in the same manner they rise with him to life and sit at the right hand of god with him in glorie thirdly here we see the ground of the certentie of perseuerance of all them that are the true children of god for the office of christ to which he is set a part is to receiue the promise of god for vs and to applie it vnto vs and this worke is done by christ without impediment and without repentance on his part the seale and foundation of our saluation is this that god accepts and knowes vs for his tim and that which concernes vs is that we must worship god in spirit and truth and depart from iniquitie lastly here is comfort against the consideration of our vnworthines thou saiest thou article vnworthie of the mercie of god and therefore hast no hope and i say againe dost thou truly exercise thy selfe in the spirituall exercises of faith inuocation repentance be not discouraged thou must not receiue the promise immediately of god but christ must doe it for thee though thou be vnworthie yet there is dignitie and worthines sufficient in him if thou say that thou must at the least receiue the promise at the hand of christ i adde further that he will not quench the flaxe that doth but smoake neither will he breake the bruised reede he accepts the weake apprehension if it be in truth and our saluation stands in this not that we know and apprehend him but that he knowes amp apprehends vs first of all v this i say in the former verses paul hath laid downe two grounds one is that testaments of man confirmed may not be abrogated the other that the promises were made to abraham and his seede which is christ now what of all this may some man say paul therefore addes these words this i say that is the scope and intent of all my speech is to shew that the couenant or testament confirmed by god cannot be abrogated and secondly if it might so be yet that the law could not abrogate the testament because it was giuen yeares after the confirmation of the saide testament and because it might be doubtfull what paul meanes when he saith the couenant confirmed cannot be abrogated he explanes himselfe in the ende of the verse by saying the promise cannot be made of no effect it is here to be obserued that paul saith the promise made to abraham is a couenant or testament it is a couenant or compact because god for his part promiseth remission of sinnes and life euerlasting and requireth faith on our part in respect of this mutuall obligation it hath in it the forme of a couenant it is also a will or testament in two respects first because the promise is confirmed by the death of the mediatour heb secondly the things promised as remission of sinnes and life euerlasting are giuen after the manner of legacies that is freely without our desert or procurement in this we see the great goodnes of god who vouchsafeth to name them in his testament that haue made couenant with the deuill and are children of wrath by nature as we all are again in that the promise is a testament remission of sinnes and life euerlasting is a legacie and for the obtainment of the we must bring nothing vnto god but hunger and thirst after them and make suit vnto god for them by asking seeking knocking thus are all legacies obtained amp there is no more required on our part but to receiue and accept them and though we be neuer so vnworthie in our selues yet shall it suffice for the hauing of the blessing of god if our names be found in the testament of god againe paul saith that the promise made to abraham is a couenant confirmed of god it may be demanded by what meanes it was confirmed ans by oath heb againe it may be demanded to whome it was confirmed ans to abraham as beeing the father of all the faithfull and then to his seede that is first to the mediatour christ and consequently to euery beleeuer whether iew or gentile for abraham in the first making and in the confirmation thereof must be considered as a publike person representing all the faithfull here againe we see god goodnes we are bound simply to beleeue his bare word yet in regard of our weaknes he is content to ratifie his promise by oath that there might be no occasion of vnbeleefe againe here we are admonished to rest by faith on the promise of god as abraham did when there is no hope some may say i could doe so if god would speake to me as he did to abraham i answer againe when god spake to abraham in him he spake to all his seede and therefore to thee whosoeuer thou article that beleeuest in christ and hence we are to gather sure hope of life euerlasting for in the person of abraham god hath spoken to vs he hath made promise of blessing to vs he hath made couenant with vs and he hath sworne vnto vs what can we more require of him what better ground of true comfort hebr lastly in that god thus confirmes vnto vs the promise of life euerlasting it must incourage vs to all diligence in the vse of all good meanes whereby we may attaine to the condition of abraham and it must arme vs to all patience in bearing the miseries amp calamites that fall out in the strait way to eternal life further paul saith that the promise is a couenant confirmed amp that in respect of christ because he is the scope amp foundation of all the promises of god partly by merit and partly by efficacie by merit because he hath procured by his death and passion remission of sinnes and life euerlasting by his efficacie because he seales vp vnto vs in our consciences remission of sinnes and withall restores in vs the image of god the vse if christ be the ground of the promise then is he the ground and fountaine of all the blessings of god and for this cause the right way to obtaine any blessing of god is first to receiue the promise and in the promise christ and christ beeing ours in him and from him we shall receiue all things necessarie the second answer of paul to the former obiection is that if the promise made to abraham might be disanulled yet the law could not doe it and he giues a double reason the first is drawne from the circumstance of time because the promise or couenant was made with abraham and continued by god yeares before the law was giuen therefore saith paul the law was not giuen to disanull the promise against this reason it may be obiected that abrahams seed was but yeares in a strange land gen ans moses speakes of the time that was from the beginning of abrahams seede or from the birth of isaac to the giuing of the law and paul here speakes of the time that was betweene the giuing of the promise to abraham and the giuing of the law and that was yeares before the birth of isaac againe it may be obiected that the israelites were in egypt yeares fxod the dwelling of the children of israel while they dwelled in egypt was yeares therefore it seemes there was more time betweene the promise and the law ans the meaning of moses in this place is thus much that the dwelling of the children of israel while they dwelt as pilgrims was for the space of yeares and that in article of this time they dwelt in egypt as strangers the words may thus be translated the dwelling or peregrination of the children of israel in which they dwelt in egrpt was yeares and this peregrination beginnes in the calling of abraham and endes at the giuing of the law in pauls example we see what it is to search the scriptures not onely to consider the scope of whole bookes and the parts thereof but to ponder and waigh euery sentence and euery part of euery sentence and euery circumstance of time place person this is the right forme of the studie of diuinitie to be vsed of the sonnes of the prophets the second reason vsed by paul is in the v it may be framed thus if the law abolish the promise then the inheritance must come by the law but that cannot be he prooues it thus if the inheritance of life eternall be by the law it is no more by the promise but it is by the promise because god gaue it vnto abraham freely by promise therefore it comes not by the law the opposition betweene the law and the promise shewes that paul in this epistle speakes not onely of the ceremoniall but also of the morall for the greatest opposition is betweene the morall law and the free promise of god let vs againe marke here the difference betweene the law and the gospel the law promiseth life but to the worker for his works or vpon condition of obedience the gospel called by paul the promise offers and giues life freely without the condition of any worke and requires nothing but the receiuing of that which is offered it may be obiected that the gospel promiseth life vpon the condition of our faith ans the gospel hath in it no morall condition of any thing to be done of vs indeede faith is mentioned after the forme and manner of a condition but in truth it is the free gift of god as well as life eternall and it is to be considered not as a worke done of vs but as an instrument to receiue things promised this difference of the law and the gospel must be kept as a treasure for it is the ground of many worthie conclusions in true religion and the ignorance of this point in the church of rome hath bin the decay of religion specially in the article of iustification thirdly we must here obserue the opposition betweene the law and the free promise of god in iustification of a sinner for if life come by the law it comes not by the promise saith paul and rom if they which are of the law are heires the promise is of none effect by this we see the church of rome ouerturnes and abrogates the free promise of god for they of that church teach that the first iustification is by meere mercie and that the second is by the workes of the law but the law and the promise cannot be mixed together more then fire and water the law ioyned with the free promise disanulls the said promise lastly in that paul saith god gaue and freely bestowed the inheritance by the promise it must be considered that this giuing is no priuate but a publike donation for abraham must be considered as a publike person and that which was giuen to him was in him giuen to all that should beleeue as he did article thou then a true beleeuer doest thou truly turne vnto god here is thy comfort the inheritance of eternall life is as surely thine as it was abrahams when he beleeued for thou article partaker of the same promise with him and when god gaue him life he gaue thee also life in him againe persons backward and carelesse must be stirred vp with all diligence to vse all good meanes that they may beleeue truly in christ and truly turne to god for so soone as they beginne to beleeue and to turne vnto god they are entred into the condition of abraham and if they continue they shall sit downe with abraham isaac and iacob in the kingdome of heauen and after this life they shall rest in the bosome of abraham for that which was done to abraham shall be done to all that walke in his steppes wherefore then serues the law it was added because of transgressions vntill the seede was come to which the promise was made and it was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediatour now a mediatour is not of one but god is one paul hath prooued before that the law doth not abolish the promise his last reason was because then the inheritance should be by the law which cannot be against this reason in the and verses there is an obiection made and answered the obiection is this if life and iustice come not by the law the law then is in vaine and this obiection is expressed by way of interrogation wherefore then serues the law the answer is in the next words it is added for transgressions that is for the reuealing of sinne and the punishment thereof and for the conuincing of man touching their sinnes rom moreouer paul sets downe the time or continuance of this vse of the law when he saith till the seede came to which the promise was made that is till christ come and accomplish the worke of mans redemption here two questions may be demanded the first is whether the law serue to reueale sinne after the coming of christ for paul saith it is added for transgressions till christ ans the law serues to reueale sinne euen to the end of the world yet in respect of the legall or mosaicall manner of reuealing sinne it is added but till christ for the law before christ did conuince man of sinne not onely by precepts and threatnings but also by rites and ceremonies for iewish washings and sacrifices were reall confessions of sinne and they were an handwriting against vs as paul saith and this manner of reuealing sinne ended in the death of christ column againe the ministerie of condemnation which was in force till christ at his comming is turned into the ministerie of the spirit and of grace corinthian for vnder the law there was pletifull reuelation of sinne with darke and small reuelation of grace but at the comming of christ man saw heauen opened and there was a plentifull reuelation of sinne with a more pletifull reuelation of grace and mercie and in this respect also the law is said to be till christ the second question is whether the seede of abraham were before christ or no ans all that followed the steppes of abrahams faith before christ were his seede yet were they not that seede that is the principall seede who is christ who is the seede blessed in himselfe and giuing blessednes to all other and the beleeuers that were before christ or after him are the eede of abraham in respect they are set into christ who is principally the seede mentioned in this text when paul saith ordained by angels in the hand of a mediatour he makes a declaration of that which he had saide before by an euident signe on this manner that the law serues to discouer transgressions it appeares by this that the iewes could not abide to receiue the law immediatly from god but it was deliuered by angels and receiued by the hand of a mediatour and this argues mans guiltines and his disagreement with god because a mediatour is of two at the least and of two beeing at difference betweene themselues the law is said to be ordained or disposed by angels because they were attendants on god in the mount when the law was deliuered secondly they were witnesses and approouers of the deliuerie thirdly it may be the voice of god whereby the law was published in the hearing of all the israelites was vttered and pronounced by the ministerie of angels for the holy ghost saith the word spoken by angels was stedfast hebr that is the law it may be said all this prooues not that angels ordained the law ans often in scripture the worke or action of the principall agent is ascribed to the instrument or minister the saints are saide to iudge the world corinthian whereas indeede they are no more but witnesses and approouers of this iudgement in the same manner timothie is said to saue himselfe and others tim the last trumpet is sounded by angels matth and it is called the voice of an archangel and the trumpe of god thess moreouer paul saith the law was deliuered by the hand of a mediatour that is of christ as some thinke but that cannot be for the hand of a mediatour signifies the ministerie and seruice of a mediatour and this seruice is inferiour to the seruice of angels because the law was deliuered by angels and receiued of them by a mediatour therefore the mediatour here mentioned is moses who stood betweene the people and god in the deliuerie of the law deut it may be obiected that there is but one mediatour christ tim ans mediatour of reconciliation is onely one and that is christ and moses is a mediatour onely in the relating and reporting the law from god to the israelites paul addes that a mediatour is not of one that is that euery mediatour is of two at the least and of two at variance and disagreement and he saith further that god is one that is alwaies the same and like himselfe without change and the reason of the speach is this paul hath taught that the law was giuen by a mediatour and that this declared a difference betweene god and man now it might be said where is the fault in this difference and who is the cause of it paul saith not god but man because god is alwaies one and the same the vse in that the law is for transgressions we are taught to examine and search our hearts and liues by the law of god zephan fanne you o nation not worthie to be loued lam let vs search our hearts and turne againe to the lord that we may the better examine our selues foure rules must be obserued the first when any one sinne is forbidden in any commandement of the law vnder it all sinnes of the same kind are forbidden all causes of them and all occasions the second a commandement negatiue includes the affirmatiue and binds vs not onely to abstaine from euill but also to doe the contrarie good the third is that euery commandement must be vnderstood with a curse annexed to it though the curse be not expressed the fourth is that we must especially examine our selues by the first and last commandements for the first forbids the first motions of our hearts against god and the last forbiddes the first motions of our hearts against our neighbour though there be no consent to doe the euill which we thinke paul saith of himselfe that the commandement thou shalt not lust was it that especially humbled him rom according to these and other rules which now i omit we must with speciall care examine our selues the want of this dutie causeth man to rot away in their sinnes without remorse or true repentance and it is the cause that so many man profit so little in hearing the word preached because they know not what sinne meanes neither can they search aright their consciences and liues moreouer after we haue begunne to practise this dutie we must often as occasion shall be giuen renue it to the end consider dauids example psalm where paul saith that the law is added till christ we see that the legall ministerie of death is abolished now and that we are vnder the ministerie of the spirit and life and for this cause we in these last daies that are ministers of the word must preach the doctrine of saluation plainly to the very consciences of man corinthian againe the people of these daies ought to abound in knowledge and their obedience should be answerable to the measure of their knowledge and if after much preaching in these daies of light the gospel be hid as it is to very many who remaine still in ignorance and disobedience it is a fearefull signe vnto them of their condemnation corinthian in that the law of god was ordained or deliuered by angels we are put in minde to reuerence it and to esteeme it as a treasure secondly we are to feare to breake the least commandement of the law because the angels that were ordainers of the law doe no doubt obserue the keepers and the breakers of it and are readie prest to be witnesses and reuengers against them that offend steuen vpbraids the iewes that the law was giuen by the dispensation of angels and yet they brake it act thirdly if thou offend and breake the law repent with speede for that is the desire and ioy of angels they that deliuered the law reioice to see the keeping of it lastly if thou sinne and repent not looke for shame and confusion before god and his angels because moses was a mediatour to the iewes papists gather that therefore angels and saints may be mediatours ans it sollowes not moses was ordained a mediatour so are not they moses was present with the iewes and had fellowship with them whose mediatour he was saints are absent in heauen and angels though they be about vs haue no fellowship with vs moses was mediatour but once and that onely in one thing saints are made continuall mediatours lastly moses was mediatour in relating amp reporting the law from god to the people saints and angels are made mediatours to relate and report our praiers and the secrets of our hearts to god whereas paul saith that a mediatour is not of one but a third betweene two at the least it may be demaunded how christ can be mediatour betweene man and god considering he is god ans though father son and holy spirit be one and the same in respect of godhead yet are they distinct in respect of person or in respect of the manner of subsisting so as the father is the father not the son or holy ghost the son the son and not the father or the h ghost the holy ghost the holy ghost and not the father or the son the son then and the father beeing persons really distinct the son may be and is mediatour first of all in respect of order to the father and in him to the son and the holy ghost for the three persons beeing of one nature and will when the father is appeased in him also the son and the holy ghost are appeased thus john saith if any man sinne we haue an aduocate with the father it may be said that christ cannot be mediatour to himselfe ans in christ consider his nature and his office by nature he is the son of god by office he is mediatour and thus he is god man or man god and as mediatour by voluntarie dispensation he is inferiour to himselfe as he is the essentiall son of god and in the same manner christ as god man is mediatour to himselfe as he is the son of god for as he is the son of god he is the partie offended as he is mediatour god man he is the partie that makes reconciliation lastly the propertie of god must be obserued that he is vnchangeable iam mal it may be obiected that god is saide in scripture to repent ans god is said to repent not because he changeth either nature or will but because he changeth his actions of mercie and loue into effects of anger after the manner of man againe it may be obiected that god changed the law and abolished ceremonies ans this god did by an vnchangeable decree before all worlds and so the change is in the law and not in god for god can decree to change this or that without change the vse god vnchangeablenes is the foundation of our comfort saint paul saith if we loue god we are knowne of him corinthian now the first we may certenly finde in our selues namely the loue of god and christ and for the second god is vnchangeable for they which are once knowne of god are euer knowne of him and that euen then when they feele nothing but god anger againe we are put in minde to be vnchangeable in good things as in faith hope loue good counsells honest promises and such like specially in the maintenance of true religion for we ought to be like vnto god it is the poesie of our grations queene semper eadem alwaies one and the same no doubt in good things specially in the religion established among vs the same must be the minde of all good subiects and all good people corinthian is the law then against the promise of god god forbid for if there had beene a law giuen which could haue giuen life surely righteousnesse should haue beene by the law but the scripture hath included all vnder sinne that the promise by the faith of iesus christ should be giuen to them that beleeue in these words paul propounds and answers an other obiection in number the fourth the occasion of the obiection is taken out of the former words in which paul saith the law is for transgressions it may be framed on this manner if the law serue to conuince and condemne vs of sinne it serues not to giue life but to kill and so it is contrarie to the promise which giuethlife the answer is made negatiuely god forbid and a double reason is rendered of the deniall the first is this if the law could giue life it should also giue iustice or iustifie and so it should be contrarie to the promise because then there should be two contrarie waies of iustification one by faith alone the other by faith with workes therefore in that it kills and condemnes it is not contrarie to the promise the second reason is in the verse things subordinate whereof one serues for the other are not contrarie the law and the promise are subordinate for the law prepares the way for the accomplishing of the promise in that it shuts all vnder sinne that the promise may be giuen to them that beleeue in christ the vse in that paul reiects the blasphemous obiection with god forbid we are taught to auoid things said or done to the dishonour of god with loathing and detestation when it was related to ahab and iezabel that naboth had blasphemed god they beeing idolaters solemnise a fast pretending danger by the sinne king caiphas supposing that christ had blasphemed rent his garments math when iob did but suspect his children of blaspheming god he called them and sanctified them iob it is the fault of our daies that many blaspheme by cursing swearing ampc without feare and many doe it as many dissolute souldiers in a brauerie and hearers thereof for the most part are nothing mooued thereat so ordinarie is the offence this shewes the wickednes of our times in the first reason paul deliuers a notable conclusion namely that the thing which is the meanes to procure life vnto vs is also the meanes of our iustice or iustification before god and good reason for iustice causeth life and that which giueth life first of all giueth iustice hence it followes that workes cannot meritoriously deserue eternall life for if life be by the workes of the law then iustice also but that cannot be for we must first of all be iustified before we can doe a good worke let the papists consider this againe they which teach that faith is alone in iustification and that both faith and workes concurre as causes of saluation are deceiued for by the former conclusion of paul if workes be causes of saluation then must they also haue a stroake in our iustification which they haue not and therefore they are the way of our saluation but not any cause at all lastly here we see that many among vs doe not hold christ or beleeue in him aright for their iustification because they hold him without change of heart and life for by pauls conclusion whome christ quickneth them he iustifieth and whome he doth not quicken them he doth not iustifie examine thy selfe then if christ haue sanctified and renewed thy heart thou article iustified if thy heart be yet vnsanctified and thy life vnreformed deceiue not thy selfe with fond imaginations thou article not yet iustified the verse followeth containing the second reason and first let vs consider the meaning of the words the scripture the words are in the originall thus that scripture namely the scripture before named the written law in the bookes of the old testament and further by the law we must vnderstand god in the law rom god hath concluded all vnder vnbeleefe concluded the law is compared to a iudge or sergeant sinne to a prison and the law is said to conclude or inclose man vnder sinne because it doth to the full accuse and conuince vs of sin so as our mouthes are stopped and we haue no way to escape all all man that came of adam by generation with all that comes from them their thoughts desires wordes and deedes the promise the thing promised which is remission of sinne and life euerlasting by the faith of christ that is the faith whereof christ is both the author and matter this is added to signifie vnto vs who are true beleeuers namely they which are beleeuers by the faith of christ against this text of paul blind reason mooueth many questions as namely why god created man and then suffered him to fall why god did not restraine the fall of adam to his person but suffers it to inlarge it selfe to all mankind so as all be shut vp vnder sinne why the promise is not giuen to all but onely to beleeuers but there are two speciall grounds vpon which we are to stay our minds the first is that god hath an absolute soueraigntie and lordship ouer all his creatures we may not therefore dispute the case with god rom he may doe with his owne what he will math the second is that the waies and iudgements of god are a gulfe into which the more we search the more we plunge our selues because they are vnsearchable rom marke the phrase of paul the scripture concludes all vnder smne if it conclude or shut vp then it determines what is sinne what not and if this be so then it may also determine what is true and what is false and so be truly tearmed a iudge of controuersies in religion if it shut vp sinners vnder their sinne then also it shuts them that erre vnder their errour for errours be sinnes and fruits of the flesh it is said blasphemously that if the scripture be a iudge it is but a dumme iudge and i say againe that offenders may plead for themselues on this sort that the law is but a dumme iudge when it condemnes them and shuts them vnder sinne but they shall finde it hath a loud voice in their consciences when they read it seriously and examine themselues by it euen so the scripture speakes sufficiently for the determination of truth and falshood in matters of saluation when it is searched with care and humilitie when paul saith we are all shut vp vnder sinne he puts vs in minde of our most miserable condition that we are captiues of sinne and satan inclosed in our sinnes as in a prison like imprisoned malefactours that waite daily for the comming of the iudge and stand in continuall feare of execution and seeing our condition is such we must labour to see and feele by experience this our spirituall bondage that we may say with paul we are sold vnder sinne and that we know there is no goodnes dwelling in our flesh rom this is one of the first lessons that we must take out in the schoole of christ againe if we seriously bethinke our selues that we are captiues of sinne and worthie of death it will make vs with contentation of minde to beare the miseries of this life sicknes pouertie reproch banishment ampc considering they come farre short of that we haue deserued who are no better then slaues of sinne and satan whereas paul saith that all man with all that proceeds from them is shut vnder sinne he teacheth that all actions of man vnregenerate are sinnes the wisdome of the flesh that is the wisest cogitations counsells inclinations of the flesh are enmitie vnto god rom to the vncleane all things are vncleane tit an euill tree cannot bring forth good fruit mat it may be obiected that naturall man may doe the workes of the morall law as to giue almes and such like rom ans sinnes be of two sorts one is when any thing is done slat against the commandement of god the second is when the act or worke is done which the law prescribes yet not in the same manner which the law prescribes in faith in obedience to the glorie of god in this second regard morall works performed by naturall man are sinnes indeede hence it followes that libertie of will in the doing of that which is truly good is lost by the fall of adam and that man cannot by the strength of naturall will helped by grace applie himselfe to the calling of god whereas paul saith that the promise is giuen to beleeuers it is manifest that the promise is not vniuersall in respect of all makind but only indefinite and vniuersall in respect of beleeuers wherfore their doctrine is not sound that teach the redemption wrought by christ to be as generall as the sinne of adam indeede if we regard the value and sufficiencie of the death of christ it is so but if we respect the communication and donation of this benefit it is not for though all be shut vnder sinne yet the promise is onely giuen to them that beleeue it is obiected that god was in christ reconciling the world to himselfe corinthian ans the text in hand shewes that by the world we are to vnderstad all beleeuers through the whole world and whereas paul saith god shut vp all vnder vnbeleefe that he might haue mercie vpon all rom his meaning is here set downe that he shut both iewes and gentiles vnder vnbeleefe that he might haue mercie vpon all that beleeue both of iewes and gentiles marke further the ende of the law is conuiction and the ende of our conuiction is that the promise of mercie may be giuen to them that beleeue here is notable comfort with incouragement to all good duties doth the law as it were in the name of god arrest thee doth it accuse and conuince thee of manifold sinnes doth it arraigne thee at the barre of god iudgement and fill thy soule with terrour dost thou by the testimonies of the law and thine owne conscience see and feele thy selfe to be a most miserable and wretched sinner well it may be thou thinkest that all this is a preparation to thy damnatio but it is not for it is cotrariwise a preparation to thy saluation for the law with a loud voice in thy heart proclaimes thee a sinner and threatens thee with perdition but the end of all this is that iesus christ may become a sauiour vnto thee so be it thou wilt come vnto him and beleeue in him for he saues no sheepe but the lost sheepe and he calls not iust man but sinners to repentance let vs therefore with all our hearts come vnto christ and beleeue in him and that by the faith of christ that is with a faith ioyned with hope loue and new obedience then shall the promise of pardon and life euerlasting be giuen to vs vpon this ground persons in despaire and grieuous offenders may see a plaine way to helpe and succour themselues for the worke of the law concluding vs vnder sinne by the mercie of god tends to our saluation if we will vse the good meanes lastly paul saith the promise is made not to euery one that beleeueth according to any faith of his owne but to them that are true beleeuers by the faith of christ therefore euery man shall not be saued in his owne faith and religion but onely they that are of the faith of christ for before faith came we were kept vnder the law and shut vp vnto the faith which should afterward be reuealed wherefore the law was our schoole master to christ that we might be made righteous by faith but after that faith is come we are no more vnder the schoole master paul in the v had said that the law was for transgressions till the seede come to which the promise was made and here he makes a more large declaration of his owne meaning the summe of all that he faith may be reduced to a comparison of things vnlike on this manner before the comming of faith we were vnder the dominion of moses law but after faith was come we were free the first part of the comparison is amplified by a double fimilitude the law was a guard vnto vs v and the law was our schoolemaster v the second part of the comparison is in the v faith that is the gospel or the doctrine of remission of sinnes and life euerlasting by christ exhibited in the flesh we we iewes i paul a iew and the rest of that nation law that is the whole oeconomie policie and regiment of moses by lawes partly morall partly ceremoniall and partly iudiciall kept compassed or guarded because the lawe before christ was to the iewes as a guard of armed man to inclose and keepe them that they should not depart from god and from their allegiance to him vnto the sinnes idolatries and superstitions of the gentiles vnto the faith that is till the faith come afterward reuealed from the creation to the law the church of god was in one familie and the rest of the world beside was no people of god from the law till christ the church of god was inclosed in the nation of the iewes and all the world beside no church or people of god and this distinction of a people and no people stoode some time after the comming of christ math goe not into the waie of the gentiles and into the cities of the samaritans enter ye not after the ascension of christ this distinction ended because the mysterie of mans redemption was then more plainly reuealed and it began then to be reuealed to the whole world coloss and rom thus we see that the law serued for transgressions because it was to the iewes as a guard to keepe them in the compasse of their dutie that they fell not away to sundrie transgressions the vse this shewes the greatnes of our corruption and that the very frame of our heart is euill continually that the lord must be faine to set his lawes about vs as a guard of armed man to keepe vs that we sinne not againe here we see the vse of god lawes which serue to preuent restraine and cut off sinne into which otherwise man would fall vnlesse they were compassed and guarded by laws some obiect for freedome of will on this manner if the lawes of god cannot be kept they are in vaine but they are not in vaine therefore they may be kept ans the major or first part of the reason is not true for there are other vses of the law of god then the keeping of them for they serue to restraine and preuent open offences and to keepe man in order at the least outwardly an other vse of the law of god was to conclude and shut vp the iewes into the vnitie of one faith and religion for this cause the iewes had but one temple one mercie seat one high priest ampc hence it followes that in a godly and christian common wealth where true religion is established there may be no tolleration of any other religion for that which is the end of god laws must also be the end of all good lawes in all common wealths and kingdomes namely to shut vp the people into the vnitie of one faith the church of the iewes is called a fountaine sealed a garden inclosed cant a vineyard hedged in isa psalm and here we see what is the hedge or wall of this garden or vineyard namely the regiment or policie of moses by a threefold kind of law this admonisheth vs to respect and with care to obserue good lawes because they are as it were hedges and fenses of all good societies and the breaking of them is the pulling downe of our fense where paul saith till the faith be reuealed note that the faith or the gospel was not reuealed to the world till the last age after the comming of christ it may be said it was alwaies reuealed to all man but not so cleerely as in these last daies ans it was not reuealed to all either darkly or cleerely before the comming of christ act god suffered the gentiles to walke in their owne waies ephesians they were without god and without christ rom paul preached where christ was not so much as named hence it followes that the vocation of man to life euerlasting is not vniuersall because christ was neuer vniuersally reuealed neither is mans redemption vniuersall in respect of the whole world for redemption by christ was not reuealed to all nation before the comming of christ and a benefit to be apprehended by faith if it be vnknowne is no benefit lastly it is erronious that some teach namely that grace supernaturall is vniuersall that is that the power to beleeue in christ and the power to turne to god if man will is generally giuen to all but this cannot be because it is not giuen to all man so much as to heare of christ and to know him seeing faith is now come it may be demanded what is the guard whereby we are kept now ans the precepts of the morall law the sayings of the wise are as nayles or stakes fastned to range man in the compasse of their owne duties ecclesiastes againe the peace of god or the assurance of our reconciliation with god is a guard to keepe our hearts and senses in christ philipp if this will not doe the deede god hath in store his corrections and iudgements to be as an hedge to hemme vs in hos this beeing so our dutie is to guard and inclose our selues specially our hearts prov and all the senses and powers of our soules psalm by the wholesome precepts and counsells of god considering we lie open to so many enemy we should continually be armed and fensed from the head to the foote ephesians otherwise we shall vpon euery occasion be ouerturned to come to the v the iewes might happily say seeing we are thus kept and shut vp by the law what meanes haue we of comfort and of saluation the answer is made the law is further our schoolemaster here by schoolemaster vnderstand one that teacheth little children or petits the first rudiments or elements a b c and the law is a schoolemaster to christ for two causes one because it points out and shadowes forth vnto vs christ by bodily rudiments of ceremonies and sacrifices the second is because the law specially the morall law vrgeth and compelleth man to goe to christ for it shewes vs our sinnes and that without remedie it shewes vs the damnation that is due vnto vs and by this meanes it makes vs dispaire of saluation in respect of our selues and thus it inforceth vs to seeke for helpe out of our selues in christ the law is then our schoolemaster not by plaine teaching but by stripes and correction in this verse paul sets downe the manner and way of our saluation which is on this manner first the law prepares vs by humbling vs then comes the gospel and it stirres vp faith and faith wrought in the heart apprehends christ for iustification sanctification and glorification paul sets this forth by a fit similitude they that would be the servant and children of god must come into the schoole of god and be taught of him in this schoole are two formes and two masters in the first forme the teacher and master is the law and he teacheth man to know their sinnes and their deserued damnation and he causeth vs to despaire of our saluation in respect of our selues and when man haue bin well schooled by the law and are brought to acknowledge their sinnes and that they are slaues of sinne and satan then must they be taken vp to an higher forme and be taught by an other schoolemaster which is faith or the gospel the lesson of the gospel is that man after they are humbled must flie to the throne of grace beleeue in christ and with all their hearts turne vnto god that they may be iustified and glorified when we haue by the teaching of this second master learned this good lesson we are become children and servant of god by this then it is manifest that there are two sorts of badde schollers in the schoole of christ among vs one sort are they which come to the lord table and yet learne nothing either from the law or from the gospel but content themselues with the teaching of nature the second sort are they which learne something but in preposterous manner for they haue learned that mercie and saluation comes by christ and with this they content themselues not suffering themselues first of all to be schooled by the law till they despaire in respect of themselues nor to be schooled of the gospel till they beleeue in christ and repent of their sinnes in a word he is a good scholler in the schoole of christ that first learnes by the law to humble himselfe and to goe out of himselfe and beeing humbled subiects his heart to the voice and precept of the gospel which biddes vs beleeue in christ turne to god and testifie our faith by new obedience in the second part of the comparison v paul sets downe one point that at the comming of the faith the iewes were freeed from the dominion of the law of moses and consequently that the said law was abrogated the lawgiuer that is the expounder of moses law was to last but till the comming of shilo gen the law of commandements standing in ordinances was abrogated by the flesh of christ ephesians and the change of the priesthood brought the change of the law hebr for the better cleering of this point three questions are to be demanded the first is when was the policie regiment or law of moses abrogated ans at the comming of the faith or when the gospel first beganne to be published to the world which was at the ascension of christ and he in his death cancelled the ceremoniall law and tooke it out of the way column when the old testament ended and the new began then was the abrogation of the law now the ending of the old testament and the beginning of the new was in the resurrection of christ for then was the beginning of the new world as it were the second question is how farre forth the law is abrogated ans the law is threefold morall ceremoniall iudiciall morall is the law of god concerning manners or duties to god and man now the morall law is abrogated in respect of the church and them that beleeue three waies first in respect of iustification and this paul prooues at large in this epistle secondly in respect of the malediction or curse there is no condemnation to them that are in christ rom thirdly in respect of rigour for in them that are in christ god accepts the indeauour to obay for obedience it selfe neuerthelesse the law as it is the rule of good life is vnchangeable and admits no abrogation and christ in this regard did by his death establish it rom the ceremoniall law is that which prescribed rites and gestures in the worship of god in the time of the old testament ceremonies are either of figure and signification or of order the first are abrogated at the comming of christ who was the accomplishment of them all column the second beeing ceremonies of particular order to the times of the old and new testament concerne not vs for example in the commandement of the sabbath some things are morall some ceremoniall some iudiciall that in one day of seuen there should be an holy rest it is morall rest vpon the seuenth day from the creation is ceremoniall in respect of order strictnes of rest from all labour is ceremoniall in respect of the signification of rest from sinne and rest in heauen therefore the particular day of rest and the manner of rest is abrogated and christ by his owne example and by the example of the apostles examples not beeing contradicted in scripture appointed the eight day or the day of christs resurrection to be the sabbath of the new testament iudiciall lawes are such as concerne inheritances lands bargaines controuersies causes criminall and they pertaine to the regiment of the commonwealth if the commonwealth of the iewes were now standing they should be gouerned by these lawes for to them were they giuen the case is not like with vs some are of minde that all iudiciall lawes are abrogated and some are of contrarie mind that all commonwealths are to be gouerned by them but they are both deceiued and the meane betweene both is the truth know then that of iudiciall lawes of moses some are abrogated some are not such lawes as are meerely iudiciall that is iudiciall and not morall and doe particularly concerne the nation of the iewes the land of canaan the times before christ the things of the old testament are abrogated of this kind is the law that commands the brother to raise vp seede to his brother deut the law of tenths is partly ceremoniall and partly iudiciall and specially concernes the land of canaan for as country are richer or poorer then canaan so must their allowance to the ministerie be more or lesse the seuenths the eights the ninths the eleuenths the twelfths and not the tenths and the allowance of tenths stands not in force in this amp other commonwealths by the iudiciall law of god but by positiue laws of country for if it did then ministers should not meddle with their tenths either for the gathering or for the disposing of them but they should be brought into storehouses by certaine ouerseers and they should dispose of them according to the neede of euery minister chronicle malac the law that the theefe must either restore fourefold or be a bondman concernes canaan and those country in europe specially in the northerne and westerne parts a straighter law is required for the people are much giuen to idlenes and consequently to robbing and they are of fierce disposition and therefore with theft ioyne violence and disturbance of the common peace and for this cause excepting in some cases theft is punished with death and this must not seeme hard for euen the iewes when the theft was aggrauated with other circumstances might punish it with death sam and it is in the power of the magistrate when sinnes are increased to increase the punishment now iudiciall lawes that are in foundation and substance morall are not abrogated but are perpetuall for the better discerning of them i giue two notes the first is this if a iudiciall law serue directly and immediatly to guard and fense any one of the ten commandements in the maine scope and ende thereof it is morall in equitie and perpetuall because the end and vse of it is perpetuall i will giue sundrie examples it is the law of god that he of the israelites that shall intise them to goe and worship other god shall be put to death deut this law serues to maintaine and vphold the first commandement the ende whereof is to inioyne vs to take the true god for our god and this ende is most necessarie both for god glorie and for the saluation of man and therefore whatsoeuer thing or person ouerturneth or abolisheth this ende it must be cut off from the societie of man here note by the way that they which haue bin borne baptised and brought vp among vs and yet afterward become masse priests and seeke malitiously and obstinately without ceasing to seduce our people deserue in this respect to be put to death example thou shalt not suffer a witch to liue exod this law againe is a fense to the first commandement for witches renounce god and humane societie and therefore are worthely cut off though they doe no hurt euen because they make a league with the deuill example he that blasphemeth the name of god shall be put to death leuit vnderstand this law of manifest and notorious blasphemies that pearce through god as the words import and then it is a maine fense to the third commandement for god name may in no wise be abused and troad vnder foote and therefore blasphemers pearcing god are to be cut off this is the very law of nature as appeares by nabuchadnezzar who gaue in commandement to his people that whosoeuer blasphemed the name of the true god should be put to death daniel here note that manifest and conuicted atheists if they be put to death haue but their deserts example he that curseth father or mother shall die the death leuit this law is a necessarie fense to the fifth commandement and vpholds the honour that is due to parents examples he that smites a man that he die shal die the death exod to this law there is no exception made but one and that is when a man is killed at vnawares and it is for his equitie perpetuall for it is a maine and direct fense to the sixth commandement consider an other reason number the whole land saith the lord shall be defiled with blood till his blood be shed that killeth a man example the adulterer amp the adulteresse shal both be put to death leuit this iudiciall serues to vphold and maintaine chastitie which is the ende of the seuenth commandement marke withall the reasons leuit least the land spne you out and for these things that is for suffering this and other sinnes vnpunished the gentiles were cast out it may be said that christ did not condemne the woman to death which was taken in adulterie ans he came to be a mediatour and not a iudge or magistrate it is alleadged that dauid was not put to death for adulterie ans he was the highest in the kingdome there was none to iudge him againe it may be saide that if adulterie be death then innumerable persons must die ans we must doe that which we finde to be the will of god and the euents of things must be left to god the second note whereby we may discerne a iudiciall law to be morall for his equitie is this if it follow necessarily and immediatly from the light principles and conclusions of nature for example deut the man shall not put on the things that appertaine to the woman nor the woman the things that appertaine to the man this law is more then iudiciall for it is a rule of common honestie practised in those country by the light of nature where the written law was neuer knowne and things good and honest which nature teacheth are morall and must be done this is pauls rule doth not nature teach this corinthian this i speake not to censure and condemne the lawes of this or any other commonwealth but onely to shew how farre iudiciall lawes haue moralitie in them and stand in force the third question is what is our guide now in the time of the new testament seeing the regiment and law of moses is abrogated ans the outward guide is the doctrine of the morall law and of the gospel it is therefore called the rodde and the staffe of god psalm and the rodde of his mouth isa the inward guide is the spirit of god writing the lawes of god in our hearts and by them guiding vs and beeing a law vnto vs rom thirdly god by manifold afflictions nurtures and schooles vs partly to preuent sinnes to come and partly to humble vs for that which is past corinthian ier the vse seeing the law is abrogated as i haue said we must be a free and voluntarie people seruing god not of constraint but willingly as if there were no law to compell vs all nation shall flow as water to the mountaine of the lord isa thy people shall come willingly in the day of assemblie psalm in the daies of john baptist the kingdome of heauen suffered violence ieremie saith they shall teach euery man his neighbour and his brother ierem because man shall learne freely without compulsion or calling vpon here is the fault of our times many say in heart to christ depart from vs we will none of thy waies and many againe are zealous for the things of this life but for duties pertaining to god worship and the saluation of their soules they are neither hot nor could this negligence and slacknes is full of danger and therefore with speede to be amended for cursed is he that doth the worke of god negligently and the lord will spue out such persons for ye are all the sonnes of god by faith in christ iesus for all ye that are baptised into christ haue put on christ there is neither iew nor greek there is neither bond nor free there is neither male nor female for ye are all one in christ iesus paul had said before v that the beleeuing iewes after the publishing of the gospel were no more vnder the law as vnder a schoolemaster in this v he renders a reason hereof and it may be framed on this manner if we iewes were still vnder the law as vnder a schoolemaster then we should be still after the manner of servant but we are not after the manner of servant because we are children for euen ye galatians and that all of you are children of god not by circumcision or by the keeping of the law but by faith in christ againe that they are children of god he prooues it thus ye are baptised into christ and in baptisme ye haue put on christ in that ye are ioyned with him and haue fellowship with him who is the naturall son of god therefore ye are sonnes of god it may be saide all children of god all baptised all put on christ how can this be seeing some are iewes some gentiles some bond some free some man some woman the answer is made v there are differences of man indeede but in christ all are as one in these words i consider two things the first is the benefit or gift bestowed on the galatians which is son ship adoption or the condition of god children the second is the description of this benefit by foure arguments the first is by the circumstance of the persons ye all are children of god the second is the inward meanes namely faith in christ iesus the third is the outward meanes or the pledge of adoption ye are all baptised into christ the last is the foundation of adoption and that is to put on christ or to be one with him for the better conceiuing of the benefit three questions may be mooued the first is whose sonnes the galatians were ans the sonnes of god it may be saide how the sonnes of god i answer againe god is called a father in two respects first he is a father in respect of christ the essentiall word and then god signifies the first person againe god is called a father in respect of man elect to saluation then the name god is put indefinitly and it comprehends not onely the first person but also the son and holy ghost for all three doe equally regenerate them that are adopted and paul saith of the godhead indefinitly there is one god and father of all ephesians and when we pray saying our father ampc we inuocate not onely the first person but also the son and holy ghost and the son of god is expressely called the father of eternitie in respect of vs isa and he is said to haue his seede isa the second question is in what respect are the galatians the children of god ans a childe of god is two waies by nature by grace the childe of god by nature is christ as he is the eternall son of god a child by grace is three waies by creation thus adam before his fall and the good angels are the children of god secondly by the personall vnion thus christ as he is man is the child of god thirdly by the grace of adoption thus are all true beleeuers and in this text the galatians are saide to be the children of god in this grace of adoption there be two acts of god one is acceptation whereby god accepts man for his children the other is regeneration whereby man are borne of god when the image of god is restored in them in righteousnes and true holines the third question is what is the excellencie of this benefit ans great euery way ioh he which is the child of god is heire and fellowheire with christ rom and that of the kingdome of heauen and of all things in heauen and earth corinthian he hath title in this life and shall haue possession in the life to come againe he that is god child hath the angels of god to tend on him and to minister vnto him for his good and saluation heb the first argument whereby the adoption of god children is set forth is concerning the persons to whome it belongs in these wordes all ye are the children of god so paul saith all the ephesians are elect ephesians and peter calls all them to whome he writes pet elect and john epistle the children of god and herein they follow the iudgement of charitie leauing all secret iudgements to god here i obserue one thing that euery grieuous fall doth not abolish the fauour of god and extinguish the grace of regeneration for the galatians erred in the foundation of religion and had fallen away to an other gospel and yet paul saith that they were for all this the children of god and not some but all of them this truth may be seene by experience the child of god before his fall hath a purpose not to sinne in the time of temptation when he is in falling he hath a strife after he is fallen he lieth not in his fall as wicked man doe but he recouereth himselfe by new repentance and this shews that the child of god by his fall doth not returne againe to the estate and condition of wicked man when s john saith he that is borne of god sinnes not his meaning is this he that is borne of god if he fall into any offence of frailtie yet doth he not make a practise of sinne as the wicked and vngodly doe it may be saide the galatians and all the galatians are the children of god but what is that to vs ans they among vs that professe true saith in christ with care to keepe good conscience are likewise to hold themselues to be children of god he beleeues not the gospel that doth not beleeue his owne adoption for in the gospel there is a promise of all the blessings of god to them that beleeue and there is also a commandement to applie the said promise to our selues and consequently to applie the gift of adoption to our selues when we are bidden to say our father we are bidden to beleeue our selues to be children of god and so to come vnto him therefore with paul i say that all we that truly beleeue in christ and haue care to lead a good life all i say are indeede the children of god the vse comforts arising by this benefit are many first if thou be god child surely he will prouide all things necessarie for thy soule and bodie math our care must be to doe the office and dutie that belongs vnto vs when this is done our care is ended as for the good successe of our labours we must cast our care on god who will prouide that no good thing be wanting vnto vs psalm they that drowne themselues in worldly cares liue like fatherlesse children secondly in that we are children we haue libertie to come into the presence of god and to pray vnto him ephesians thirdly nothing shall hurt them that are the children of god the plague shall not come neere their tabernacle they shall walke vpon the lyon and the aspe and tread them vnder foote psalm all things shall turne to their good rom and the rather because the angels of god pitch their tents about them lastly god will beare with the infirmities and frailties of them that are his children if there be in them a care to please him with a purpose of not sinning malach if a child be sicke the father or mother doe not cast it out of dores much lesse will god the duties first if ye be god children then walke worthie your profession and calling be not vassalls of sinne and satan carrie your selues as kings sonnes bearing sway ouer the lusts of your owne hearts the temptations of the deuill and the leud customes and fashions of this world when dauid kept his fathers sheepe he behaued himselfe like a shepheard but when he was called from the sheepefold and chosen to be king he carried himselfe accordingly so must we doe that of children of the deuill are made the children of god and if we liue according to the lusts of our flesh as the man of this world doe whatsoeuer we professe we are in truth the children of the deuill ioh ioh secondly we must vse euery day to bring our selues into the presence of god and we must doe all things as in his sight and presence presenting our selues vnto him as instruments of his glorie in doing of his will this is the honour that the child of god owes vnto him mal thirdly our care must be according to the measure of grace to resemble christ in all good vertues and holy conuersation for he is our eldest brother the first borne of many brother and therefore we should be like vnto him ioh fourthly we must haue a desire and loue to the word of god that we may grow by it in knowledge grace and good life for this is the milke and foode whereby god feedes his childre pet such persos the amog vs that haue no loue or liking of the word but spend their daies in ignorace amp securitie shew themselues to be no children of god the child in the armes of the mother or nurce that neuer desires the brest is certenly a dead child lastly we must put this in our accounts that we must haue many afflictions if we be god children for he corrects all his children and when we are vnder the rodde of correction we must refigne our selues to the will and good pleasure of god this is childlike obedience and this must be done in silence and with all quietnes then god is best pleased the internall meanes of adoption is faith in christ and for the better conceiuing of it three questions are to be propounded the first what a kind of faith is this ans a particular or speciall faith and it hath three acts or effects the first is to beleeue christ to be jesus that is a sauiour the second is to beleeue that christ is my or thy sauiour the third is to put the confidence of heart in him when thomas felt the wounds of christ he said my lord and my god and thereupon christ said because thou hast seene thou beleeuest ioh here marke that to beleeue christ to be my christ is faith against this speciall faith the papists obiect three arguments the first is this euery speciall faith must haue a speciall word of god for his ground but there is no speciall word that thy sinnes or my sinnes are forgiuen by christ therefore there is no speciall faith ans we haue that which in force and value is equiualent to a speciall word namely a generall promise with a commandement to applie the said promise to our selues secondly i answer that the word and promise of god generally propounded in scripture is made particular in the publike ministerie in which when the word is preached to any people god reueales two things vnto them one that his will is to saue them by christ the other that his will is that man should beleeue in christ and the word thus applied in the publike ministerie in the name of god is as much as if an angel should particularly speake vnto vs from heauen the second argument speciall faith say they is absurd because by it a sinner must beleeue the pardon of his sinnes before he hath it in as much as faith is the meanes to obtaine pardon ans the giuing and the receiuing of pardon and faith are both at one moment of time for when god giues the pardon of sinne at the same instant he causeth man to receiue the same pardon by faith for order of nature faith goes before the receiuing of the pardon because faith is giuen to them that are to be ingrafted into christ and pardon to them that are in christ for time it doth not and therfore this second argument is absurd the third argument the full certentie and perswasion of god mercie in christ followes good conscience and good workes and therefore faith followes after iustification ans there be two degrees of faith a weake faith and a strong faith a weake faith is that against which doubting much preuailes in which there is a sorrow for vnbeleefe a will and defire to beleeue in christ with care to vse good meanes and to increase in faith strong faith is that which preuailes against doubting and it is a full perswasion or resolution of the loue and mercie of god in christ this second degree of faith follows iustification vpon the obseruation and experience of the prouidence and goodnes of god but the first degree of speciall faith before named for order goes before iustification and for time is together with it the second question is when faith beginnes first to breede in the heart ans when a man beginnes to be touched in his conscience for his sinnes and vpon feeling of his owne spirituall pouertie earnestly hungers and thirsts after christ and his righteousnes aboue all things in the world christ saith i will giue to him that thirsteth of the well of the water of life freely revelation this promise declares that in thirsting there is a measure of faith to eate and drinke christ the bread and water of life is to beleeue in him and to hunger and thirst hauing as it were a spirituall appetite to christ is the next steppe to this eating and drink therefore this must be remembred that professours of the gospel yes teachers of the same that want this sense of their vnworthines and this thirsting are farre wide what gifts soeuer they haue for they are not yet come to the first steppe of true faith the third question is how faith in christ is reuealed in the heart ans it is not faith to conceiue in minde a bare perswasion that christ is my sauiour and thereupon to thinke to be saued but faith in christ is conceiued in the spirituall exercises of inuocation and repentance when i see mine owne sinnes and god anger against me for them by the law when i see mine owne guiltines i draw my selfe into the presence of god making confession of mine offences and praier for the pardon of them and in this praier i striue against mine vnbeleefe i will desire and endeauour to assent to the promise of god touching forgiuenes and withall i purpose with my selfe to sinne no more this is my daily practise and thus is faith truly conceiued and confirmed againe faith is conceiued in the vse of holy meanes namely the preaching of the word and sacraments for in hearing amp receiuing the lord supper to meditate vpon the promise of mercie and in meditation to applie the said promise to my selfe is the right way to conceiue true faith therefore it must be remembred that faith conceiued without the exercises of inuocation and repentance or conceiued without the vse of the word and sacraments as commonly it is is not true faith but an imagination or fiction of the braine which will faile in the ende the third point to be considered is the signe or the outward meanes of adoption and that is baptisme it may be demanded how baptisme can be a marke or signe of the child of god considering all sorts of man are partakers of it ans baptisme alone is no marke of god child but baptisme ioyned with faith for so must the text be conceiued all ye galatians that beleeue are baptised into christ for paul had said immediatly before ye are the sounes of god by faith againe the scripture speaking of baptisme comprehends both the outward and the inward baptisme which is the inward baptisme of the spirit math and pet and thus is baptisme alwaies an infallible marke of the child of god it may further be demanded what are the markes of the inward baptisme ans the new birth whereby a man is washed and cleansed by the spirit of god hath three speciall markes the first is the spirit of grace and supplications zach that is the spirit of regeneration causing man to turne to god and withall to make instant praier and supplication for mercie and forgiuenes of sins past the second is to heare amp obay the voice of god in all things ioh amp the third is not to sin that is not to liue in in the practise of any sinne after this new birth is begunne ioh he that is borne of god doth not commit sinne he may faile in this or that speach and doe amisse in this or that action but after his calling and conuersion the tenour and course of his life shall be according to the commandements of god and this is a speciall marke to discerne the inward baptisme some alleadged that hauing long agoe beene baptised with water yet they feele not the inward baptisme and therefore they feare that they are not the children of god ans if there be in thee a sorrow for thy corruptions and sinnes past if thou hast a purpose to sinne no more if thou auoidest the occasions of sinne and fearest to offend if hauing sinned thou liest not in thy sinne but recouerest thy selfe by new repentance thou article verily borne of god and baptised with the baptisme of the holy ghost others alleadge that although they haue bin baptised yet they feare they haue no faith and therefore they thinke they are not the children of god ans if there be in thee a sorrow for thine vnbeleefe a will and desire to beleeue and a care to increase in faith by the vse of good meanes there is a measure of true faith in thee and by it thou maist assure thy selfe that thou article the child of god others againe alleadge that they haue long made praier vnto god and that according to his will and yet their praiers haue not bin heard and therefore they often doubt they are not god children ans if thou canst pray though thy praier be not heard according to thy desire content thy selfe for the praier of the heart is the marke of the spirit of adoption rom and by it thou maist know that thou article the child of god thus then we see what is the infallible marke of the child of god namely baptisme ioyned with true faith in christ or the outward baptisme ioyned with the inward baptisme of the spirit the vse many auouch the present church of rome to be the true church of god and that because they say in it there is true baptisme which is a marke of the church of god but they are deceiued for baptisme in the church of rome is seuered from true faith or from the apostolike doctrine and the outward baptisme is seuered from the inward baptisme for they of that church ouerturne iustification by the meere mercie of god which is the principall part of the inward baptisme againe the ten tribes retained circumcision after their apostasie yet for all that condemned to be no people of god ose the light in the lanthorne pertaines not to the lanthorne but to the passengers in the streete euen so the confession of faith in the symboll of the apostles and baptisme that are retained in the papacie pertaine not to the papacie but to another hidden church which by these and other meanes is gathered out of the middest of roman babylon and therefore baptisme is rather a signe of this then of the roman church againe we must be warned to take heede that we deceiue not our selues thinking it a sufficient matter that we haue bin baptised for except christ inwardly wash vs by his spirit we haue no part in him ioh circumcision saith paul auaileth not vnles thou be a doer of the law ro baptisme indeed saueth pet but that is not the baptisme of water but the stipulation of a good conscience by the resurrection of christ the outward baptisme without the inward is not the marke of god child but the marke of the foole that makes a vow and afterward breakes it ecclesiastes moreouer baptisme is not onely a signe of our adoption but also a seale thereof and a meanes to conuaie it vnto vs and for the better vnderstanding of this point and for a further clearing of the verse i will speake of the whole nature of baptisme that which is to be deliuered i reduce to eight heads i the name of baptisme and the phrases ii the matter iii the forme iv the ende v the efficacie of baptisme vi the necessitie thereof vii the circumstances viii the vse touching the name baptisme is taken sixe waies first it signifies the superstitious washings of the pharisies who boud themselues to the baptismes or washings of cuppes and potts mark second it signifies the washings appointed by god in the ceremoniall law hebr thirdly it signifies that washing by water which serues to seale the couenant of the new testament math fourthly it signifies by a metaphor any grieuous crosse or calamitie thus the passion of christ is called his baptisme luke fiftly it signifies the bestowing of extraordinarie gifts of the holy ghost and that by imposition of hands of the apostles act and lastly it signifies the whole ecclesiasticall ministerie thus apollos is saide to teach the way of the lord knowing nothing but the baptisme that is the doctrine of john act in the third sense is baptisme taken in this place when paul saith ye are all baptised into christ the phrases vsed in scripture of baptisme are strange in reason and therefore they are to be explaned here it is said ye that are baptised into christ put on christ the reason of this speach is threefold the first is this the washing of the bodie with water is an outward signe to represent to our eies and minde the inward washing and our vnion or coniunction with christ therefore they that are baptised are said to put on christ the second reason is because the washing by water seales vnto vs our inward ingrafting into christ for as certenly as the bodie is washed with water so certenly are they that beleeue ingrafted into christ the third reason of the speach is because baptisme is after a sort an instrument whereby our insition into christ and fellowship with him is effected for in the right and lawful vse of baptisme god according to his owne promise ingrafts them into christ that beleeue and the inward washing is conferred with the outward washing for these causes they that are washed with water in baptisme are said to put on christ in the same manner must other phrases be vnderstood as when it is said that baptisme saueth pet that man must be baptised for the remission of sinnes act that we are buried by baptisme into the death of christ rom the second point concernes the matter of baptisme here i consider three things the signe the thing signified the analogie of both the signe is partly the element of water act and partly the rite by diuine institution appertaining to the element which is the sacramentall vse of it in washing of the bodie and these two water and externall washing of the bodie are the full and complete signe of baptis e here a question may be made whether washing of the bodie in baptisme must be by dipping or by sprinkling ans in hot country and in the baptisme of man of yeares dipping was vsed and that by the apostl and to this paul alludes rom and dipping doth more fully represent our spirituall washing then sprinkling neuerthelesse in cold coutries and in the baptisme of infants new borne sprinkling is to be vsed and not dipping in respect of their health and life for the rule is necessitie and charitie dispense with the ceremoniall law vpon this ground dauid did eate the shewbread circumcision was not alwaies the eight day as appeares by the israe lites in the wildernes and for the same cause in these country dipping may be omitted though otherwise a sacramentall rite and it must be remembred that baptising signifies not onely that washing which is by diuing of the bodie but also that which is by sprinkling the thing signified or the substance of baptisme is christ himselfe our mediatour as he gaue himselfe to wash amp cleanse vs thus paul saith that he cleanse th his church by the washing of water ephesians the analogie or proportion of both is on this manner water resembles christ crucified with all his merits s john saith the blood of christ cleanseth vs from all our sinnes ioh that is the merit and efficacie of christ crucified freeth vs from our sinnes and from the guilt and punishment thereof externall washing of the bodie resembles inward washing by the spirit which stands in iustification and sanctification corinthian tit the dipping of the bodie signifies mortification or fellowship with christ in his death the staying vnder the water signifies the buriall of sinne and the comming out of the water the resurrection from sinne to newnes of life rom the third point concernes the forme of baptisme math goe teach all nation baptizing them into the name of the father ampc i explaine the words thus marke first it is faide teach them that is make them my disciples by calling them to beleeue and to repent here we are to consider the order which god obserues in making with man the couenant in baptisme first of all he calls man by his word and commands the to beleeue and repent when they beginne to beleeue and repent then in the second place god makes his promise of mercie and forgiuenes and thirdly he seales his promise by baptisme this diuine order christ signifieth when he saith make them disciples and as alwaies obserued of god before he made any couenant with abraham and before he sealed it by circumcision he saith to him walke before me and be vpright gen and of his seede he saith they must first doe righteousnes and iudgement and then he will bring vpon them all that he hath spoken gen to the israelites he saith that they must turne and obay and then he will make all his promises and couenants good deut and isa to the iewes peter saith repent first and then they shall be baptized for the remission of sinnes act and philip saide to the eunuch if thou beleeuest with all thy heart thou maist be baptized act the vse by this order we see that the commandement to beleeue and to repent is more large and generall then the promise of mercie in christ for the commandement is giuen to all hearers to turne and beleeue and the promise is made onely to such hearers as doe indeede turne and beleeue therefore it is a falshood to imagine that the promise of saluation belongs generally to all mankind againe by this order it appeares that repentance belongs to baptisme and it is one of the first things that are required and therefore it is follie to make repentance a distinct meanes of saluation and a distinct sacrament from baptisme thirdly if it be demanded why so many persons that haue bin baptized liue for all this as if they had not bin baptized in the common sinnes of the world like prophane esaus and yet doe comfort themselues in their baptisme ans they doe not know and consider the order which god vsed in couenanting with them in baptisme but they deale preposterously ouerslipping the commandement of repenting and beleeuing and in the first place lay hold of god promise made to them in baptisme this is the cause of so much prophanesse in the world againe there be many persons that haue bin baptized who neuertheles cannot abide to heare and read the word of god and the reason is because they obserue not the order of their baptisme first of all to become disciples and then to lay hold of the promises of god they likewise are to be blamed that bring vp their youth in ignorance for they are baptized vpon condition that they shall become disciples of christ when they come to yeares of discretion and they are by this meanes barred from all the mercies of god for we must as good disciples obay the commandement that biddes vs turne and beleeue before we can haue any benefit or profit by any of the promises of god lastly we are here taught in the working of our saluation to keepe the order of god which he hath set downe vnto vs in baptisme which is first of all to turne vnto god according to all his lawes and secondly vpon our conuersion to lay hold of the promises of god and the confirmation thereof by the sacraments thus shall we find comfort in the promises of god and haue true fellowship with god if we beginne where he beginnes in making of his couenant with vs and end where he ends and this we must doe not onely in the time of our first conuersion but also afterward in the time of distresse and affliction and at such times as by frailtie we fall and offend god in a word if for practise we alwaies keepe our selues to this order we shall find true comfort in life and death it followes baptizing them into the name or in the name of the father son and holy ghost these words signifie first to bap tize by the commandement and authoritie of the father son and holy ghost secondly to baptize by and with the inuocation of the name of the true god whatsoeuer ye doe in ward or deede doe it in the name of our lord iesus christ that is by the in vocation of the name of christ column thirdly to baptize in the name ampc signifies to wash with water in token that the partie baptized hath the name of god named vpon him and that he is receiued into the houshold or familie of god as a child of god a member of christ and the temple of the holy ghost thus iacob faith in the adoption of ephraim and manasses let them be mine and let my name be called vpon them gen and paul saith that the corinthians might not be named and distinguished by paul cephas apollos because they were not baptized into their names but into the name of christ corinthian and this i take to be the full sense of the phrase here we see what is done in baptisme the couenant of grace is solemnised betweene god and the partie baptised and in this couenant some actions belong to god and some to the parties baptised god actions are two the first is the making of promise of reconciliation that is of remission of sinnes and life euerlasting to them that are baptised and beleeue the second is the obsignation or sealing of this promise and that is twofold outward or inward the outward seale is the washing by water and this washing serues not to seale by nature but by the institution of god in these words baptize them ampc and therefore paul saith cleansing the church by the washing of water in the word ephesians the inward sealing is by the earnest of god spirit ephesians the action of the partie baptized is a certaine stipulation or obligation whereby he binds himselfe to giue homage to the father son and holy ghost this homage stands in faith whereby all the promises of god are beleeued and in obedience to all his comandements the signe of this obligation is that the partie baptized willingly yeelds himselfe to be washed with water it is not saide in the name of god but in the name of the father son and holy ghost to teach vs the right way to know and to acknowledge the true god this knowledge stands in sixe points all here expressed the first is that there is one god and no more for though there be three that are named yet there is but one name that is one in authoritie will and worship of all three and elswhere man are said to be baptized into the name of the lord act the second is that this one true god is the father son and holy ghost a mysterie vnsearchable the third that these three are really distinct so as the father is first in order the son the second and the holy ghost not the first or second but the third the fourth is that they are all one in operation ioh and specially in the act of reconciliation or couenant making for the father sends the son to be our redeemer the son workes in his owne person the worke of redemption and the holy ghost applies the same by his efficacie the fift is that they are all one in worship for the father son and holy ghost are ioyntly to be worshipped together and god in them the last is that we are to know god not as he is in himselfe but as he hath reuealed himselfe vnto vs in the couenant of grace and therefore we must acknowledge the father to be our father the son to be our redeemer the holy ghost to be our comforter and seeke to grow in the knowledge and experience of this it may be demanded whether baptisme may not be administred in the name of christ alone or in the name of god without mention of the persons in the godhead ans no for the true forme of baptisme is here prescribed if it be said that peter biddes them of ierusalem repent and be baptized into the name of christ act i answer that peters intent in that place is to set downe not the forme of baptisme but the ende and scope thereof which is that we may attaine to true fellowship with christ the fourth point is concerning the endes of baptisme which are foure the first is that baptisme serues to be a pledge vnto vs in respect of our weaknes of all the graces and mercies of god and specially of our vnion with christ of remission of sinnes and of mortification secondly it serues to be a signe of christian profession before the world and therefore it is called the stipulation or interrogation of a good conscience pet thirdly it serues to be a meanes of our first entrance or admission into the visible church lastly it is a meanes of vnitie read ephesians corinthian the fifth point concernes the efficacie of baptisme of which there be foure necessarie questions the first is whether the efficacie of baptisme extend it selfe to all sinnes and to the whole life of man for answer i will set downe what we teach and what the papists we teach that the vse of baptisme inlargeth it selfe to the whole life of man and that it takes away all sinnes past present and to come one caution remembred that the partie baptised stand to the order of baptisme which is to turne vnto god and to beleeue in christ and so to continue by a continuall renouation of faith and repentance as occasion shall be offered reasons may be these first the scripture speakes of them that had long before bin baptised and that in the time present baptisme saueth pet and ye are buried by baptisme into the death of christ rom and in the future tense it is saide he that beleeueth and is baptised shall be saued and paul saith that the church is cleansed with the washing of water that it may be presented glorious and without spot vnto god ephesians and all this shewes that baptisme hath the same efficacie after which it had before the administration thereof secondly the couenant of grace is euerlasting isa hos and the couenant is the foundation or substance of baptisme therefore baptisme is not to be tied to any time but it must haue his force so long as the couenant is of force and this appeares by the example of the galatians who are now fallen away to an other gospel after their baptisme and yet are instructed and directed by their baptisme lastly it hath bin the doctrine of the ancient church that all sinnes are done away by baptisme euen sinnes to come the doctrine of the papists is that baptisme takes away all sinnes that goe before the administration thereof and that sinnes after baptisme are not taken away by baptisme but by the sacrament of pennance but the doctrine is erronious as may appeare by the arguments which they vse argum first circumcision had no vse after the administration thereof for the abolishing of sinne therefore neither hath baptisme ans circumcision had and this appeares because the prophets put the iewes in minde of their circumcision when they fell away from god bidding them to circumcise the foreskin of their hearts ier arg the apostles vsed to call them that sinned after baptisme to confession of sinne and to repentance or pennance act ioh ans this makes for vs for in so doing they bring man to their baptisme and to the order set downe there which is that the partie baptised must first of all turne to god and beleeue in christ and there is no new order set downe afterward but onely a renewing of this first baptismall order both in the ministerie of the word and in the supper of the lord and whereas they make a distinction of pennance the vertue and pennance the sacrament placing the vertue before and after baptisme and the sacrament onely after for this they haue no word of god arg if a man be inlightned that is baptised and then fall againe he cannot be renewed by repentance which is in baptisme hebr ans the text speakes not of them that fall after baptisme but of them that fall away by an vniuersall apostasie denying christ for it is said v that they crucifie christ againe that is crucifie christ crucified and so make a mocke of him and tread vnder foote the blood of christ hebr againe the text speakes not particularly of repentance in baptisme but of all repentance whatsoeuer yes of repentance after baptisme for there is no place for repentance where christ is renounced arg pennance as hierome saith is a second table after a shipwracke ans repentance indeede is a second table or bord whereby a sinner fallen from his baptisme returnes againe to it and so comes to the hauen of euerlasting happines thus then we see that baptisme is the true sacrament of repentance for repentance pertaines to the inward baptisme the vse if baptisme serue for the whole life of man then if thou be in any miserie or distresse haue recourse to thy baptisme and there shalt thou finde thy comfort namely that god is thy god if thou truly turne and beleeue in him secondly remember euery day the obligation of homage wherewith thou hast bound thy selfe to god specially in thy temptations remember it and see thou stand to it and make it good the second question is whether baptisme abolish originall sinne or no the answer of the papist is that it doth so as in the partie baptised there remaineth nothing that god may iustly hate and therefore he saith that originall sinne after baptisme ceaseth to be sinne properly we teach and are to hold that the perfect and intire baptisme in which the outward and inward baptisme are ioyned together abolisheth the punishment of sinne and the guilt that is the obligation to punishment and the fault yet not simply but in two respects first in respect of imputation because god doth not impute originall sinne to them that are in christ secondly in respect of dominion because originall sinne raigneth not in them that are regenerate neuerthelesse after baptisme it remaines in the that are baptised and is still and that properly sinne paul saith rom if i doe that i would not it is no more i that doe it but sinne that dwelleth in me doth it here marke paul calls concupiscence in himselfe after regeneration sinne and that properly because he saith it is the same that maketh man to sinne and column he saith mortifie your earthly members and among the rest he nameth euill concupiscence and to the ephesians be ye renewed in the spirit of your mindes therefore after baptisme some portions remaine still of the old man or of originall sinne s john saith ioh if we say we haue no sinne we deceiue our selues answer is made that this is spoken of veniall or small sinnes but how can they be small sinnes that are to be washed away with the blood of christ as he saith v and if these words be spoken of infants as they are then must concupiscence be a sinne in them for they haue no actuall sinnes lastly christ saith ioh he that is all washed must haue his feete that is his carnall affections washed here obserue two things one that defilements of sinne remaine in them that are washed the second that they are after the first washing to be done away by christ and not by the acts of our pennance the grounds of popish doctrine in this point are two the first is this they make three degrees of concupiscence the first is the pronesse in the flesh to rebell against the law of the minde or the pro esse to euill the second stands in the first motions to sinne which goe before consent of will the third stands in acts of lust ioyned with consent of will this third they say is forbidden in the moral law which forbids and condemnes voluntarie concupiscence and the two first are not because as they speake concupiscence it selfe with the first motions are not in mans power and therefore they are rather to be tearmed defects or infirmities then sinnes and that man are no more to be blamed for them then for the diseases of their body ans the doctrine is false for it is an euident truth that concupiscence with the first motions thereof to euill is condemned in the morall law it is a principle in expounding the law where any actuall sinne is forbidden there all causes occasions amp furtherances thereof are likewise forbidden therefore considering actuall concupiscence ioyned with consent is forbidden in the law originall concupiscence with the first motions thereof beeing causes of the former are likewise forbidden and paul saith he had not knowne lust to be sinne vnlesse the law had said thou shalt not lust rom now he was a doctor of the law and knew that lust with consent was a sinne for thus much the light of nature teacheth therfore the law speakes of an higher degree of lust namely of lust going before consent the second ground is this when sinne is remitted it doth not make man guiltie but ceaseth to be a fault originall sinne therefore ceaseth to be sinne after baptisme ans though actuall guilt be taken away yet potentiall guilt remaineth namely an aptnes in originall sinne to make man guiltie and though it be not the fault of this or that person yet it is a fault in nature or as it is considered in it selfe the vse if originall sinne remaine after baptisme to the death then we must humble our selues and vse to the very death the plea of mercie and pardon denying our selues and resting on christ againe if persons baptised be sinners to the death it may be demaunded what difference there is betweene the godly and vngodly ans in them that are regenerate there is a sorrow for their inward corruptions and for their sinnes past with a detestation of them and withall there is a purpose in them to sinne no more and with this purpose there is ioyned an endeauour to please god in all his commandements so as if they doe sinne they can say with good conscience that they sinned against their purpose and resolution this cannot the vngodly man doe the third point is how baptisme conferres grace ans it conferres grace because it is a meanes to giue and exhibit to the beleeuing minde christ with his benefits and this it doth by his signification for it serues as a particular and infallible certificate to assure the partie baptised of the forgiuenes of his sinnes and of his eternall saluation and whereas the minister in the name of god applies the promise of mercie to him that is baptised it is indeede as much as if god should haue made a particular promise to him in this regard baptisme may well be said to conferre grace as the kings letters are said to saue the life of the malefactour when they doe but signifie to him and others that the kings pleasure is to shew fauour againe baptisme may be saide to conferre grace because the outward washing of the bodie is a token or pledge of the grace of god and by this pledge faith is confirmed which is an instrument to apprehend or receiue the grace of god and this confirmation is made by a kind of reasoning in the minde on this manner he that vseth the signe aright shall receiue the thing signified i saith the partie baptised beeing of yeares vse the signe aright in faith and repentance therefore i shall receiue the thing signified remission of sinnes and life euerlasting a king saith to his subiect he that brings the head of such a traytour shall haue a thousand poundes well the head of the foresaid traytour is cut off and he that hath the head may say here is a thousand pounds or this will bring me a thousand pounds because it is vnto him as a pledge vpon the kings word of the reward of a thousand pounds and so is the washing in baptisme an infallible pledge to him that beleeues of the pardon of his sinnes thus doe the sacraments conferre grace and no otherwise one reason for many may be this the word of god confirs grace for it is the power of god to saluation to them that beleeue and this it doth by signifying the will of god by the eare to the mind now euery sacrament is the word of god made visible to the eye the sacrament therefore confirs grace by vertue of his signification and by reason it is a pledge by the appointment of god of his mercie and goodnes it may be said a sacrament is not only a signe and a seale but also an instrument to conuay the grace of god to vs answer it is not an instrument hauing the grace of god tyed vnto it or shut vp in it but an instrument to which grace is present by assistance in the right vse thereof because in amp with the right vse of the sacrament god conferres grace and thus is it an instrument and no otherwise that is a morall and not a physicall instrument the doctrine of the papist is that the sacrament conferres grace by the worke done that is that the outward action of the minister conferres grace by his owne force when the sacrament is administred and that it may conferre grace some say that the saide action hath vertue in it for this purpose which passeth away when the action is ended others say it hath no vertue in it but that god vsing of the action eleuates it and makes it able to conferre grace but this doctrine is a fiction of the braine of man john the baptist math makes two baptizers himselfe and christ and he distinguisheth their actions his owne action is to wash with water and the action of christ is to wash with the holy ghost this distinction he would not haue made if he by the washing of water had conferred the holy ghost paul saith christ sanctifieth his church by the washing of water through the word ephesians baptisme therefore doth not conferre grace because the bodie is washed with water but because when it is washed the word of promise is beleeued and receiued the apostles are called fellowworkers with god corinthian and yet in the worke of regeneration and in giuing of life they are not any thing v peter saith directly that the washing away of the filth of the flesh doth not saue but the stipulation that a good conscience makes to god pet the worke of creation is from god immediatly and onely now regeneration is a worke of creation and therefore it is of god immediatly and not immediatly from the sacrament and mediatly from god the flesh of christ is eleuated and exalted aboue the condition of all creatures neuertheles vertue to giue life is not in the flesh of christ but in the godhead much lesse then shall the sacraments haue vertue in them to conferre grace faith is said to iustifie yet not by his owne vertue for it doth not cause our iustification but serue as a meanes to apprehend it when it is caused by god how then shall the sacraments cause iustification lastly if the outward washing of the bodie be eleuated aboue his naturall condition in the administration of baptisme then so oft as the outward element is vsed in any sacrament there is a miracle wrought and ministers of sacraments are workers of miracles which may not be said againe their doctrine is erronious in that they teach that the outward act in the sacrament performed by the minister cofers grace where there is no gift of faith to receiue that which is conferred contrarie to that saying ioh as many as receiued him he gaue this power to be the sonnes of god indeed they say there must be faith and repentance to dispose the partie but this disposition serues onely to take away impediments and not to inable vs to receiue that which god giueth the vse we must not thinke it sufficient that we come to the church heare god word and pray contenting our selues in the worke done for thus shall we deceiue our selues but in doing these acts of religion we must in our hearts turne vnto god and by faith imbrace his promises otherwise the best actions we doe shall be vnprofitable vnto vs heb againe if the vsing of the element in the sacrament doe not conferregrace then be assured that charmes and spells be the words neuer so good haue no vertue in them to doe vs good but by diabolicall operation the last question is whether baptisme imprint a character or marke in the soule which is neuer blotted out ans in scripture there is a twofold marke of distinction one visible the other inuisible of the first kind was the blood of the paschall lambe in the first passeouer for by it the first borne of the israelites were marked when the first borne of the egyptians were slaine of this kind is baptisme for by it christian people are distinguished from iewes turkes and infidel the inuisible marke is twofold the first is the eternall election of god tim the foundation of god stands sure and hath this seale the lord knowes who are his by vertue of this christ saith i know my sheepe ioh and by this the elect of all nation are marked apocrypha and the second is the gift of regeneration which is nothing els but the imprinting of the image of god in the soules of man and by this beleeuers are said to be sealed ephesians corinthian and baptisme is a meanes to see this marke in vs because it is the lauer of regeneration the papists haue deuised another worke which they call the indeleble character and they make it to be a distinct thing from regeneration and they say it is imprinted in the soules of all man good and bad and remaines in them when they are condemned what this marke should be they cannot tell some make it a quality some a relation but indeed there is no scripture for it the truth is it is a meere fiction of the braine of man the sixt point to be handled concernes the necessitie of baptisme here we must put difference betweene the couenant of grace and baptisme which is the confimation or seale of the couenant to make couenant with god and to be in the said couenant is absolutely necessarie to saluation for vnles god be our god and we the servant of god we cannot be saued baptisme it selfe is necessarie in part first in respect of the commendement of god who hath inioyned vs to vse it secondly in respect of our weakenes who haue neede of all helps that may confirme our faith yet baptisme is not simply necessarie to saluation for the want of baptisme when it canbe had doth not condemne but the contempt of it when it may be had and the contempt is pardonable if man repent afterward for the children of beleeuing parents are borne holy corinthian and theirs is the kingdome of god and therefore if they die before baptisme they are saued the theese vpon the crosse and many holy martyrs haue died without baptisme and are in the kingdome of heauen it is obiected that the male child which is not circumcised must by god commandement be cut off from the people of god gen and therefore he that is not baptised must also be cut off ans the text is spoken and meant not of infants but of man of yeares who beeing till then vncircumcised despise the ordinance of god and refuse to be circumcised and this appeares by the reason following for he hath made my couenant void now infants doe not this but their parents or man of yeares secondly the speach of christ is obiected ioh except a man be borne of water and the holy ghost he cannot enter into the kingdome of god ans christ alludes to the washings of the old testament ezech and withall giues an exposition of them on this manner thou article a pharisie and louest much washing but if thou wouldest enter into the kingdome of heauen thou must be washed with cleane water that is borne anew by the holy ghost againe i answer that if the words be meant of baptisme they carrie this sense the kingdome of heauen doth not signifie life eternall but the church of the new testament and that in his visible estate mark and baptisme makes man visible members of the church and regeneration by the spirit makes them true and liuely members here then baptisme is made necessarie not in respect of eternall life but in respect of our admission and entrance into the church whereof it is now the onely meanes the seauenth point is touching the circumstances of baptisme which are fiue the first concernes the persons which are to administer baptisme of whome i propound foure questions the first is whether not onely ministers of the word but also lay persons as they are called or meere priuate man may administer baptisme ans ministers of the word onely for to baptize is a part of the publike ministerie matth goe teach all nation baptizing them and marke how preaching and baptising are ioyned together and things which god hath ioyned no man may separate againe he that must performe any part of the publike ministerie must haue a calling rom hebr but meere priuate persons haue no calling to this busines and whatsoeuer is not of faith is sinne now the administration of baptisme by priuate persons is without faith for there is neither precept nor fit example for it in the word of god the example of zippora is alleadged exod who circumcised her child ans the example is many waies discommendable for shee did it in the presence of her husband when there was no neede shee did it in hast that shee might haue preuented her husband shee did it in anger for shee cast the foreskin at the feete of moses and it seemes shee was no beleeuer but a meere madianite for shee contemned circumcision when shee called her husband a man of blood by reason of the circumcision of the child v and in this respect it seemes moses either put her away or shee went away when he went downe to egypt againe it is obiected that priuate persons may teach and therefore baptize ans priuate teaching and ministeriall teaching are distinct in kind as the authoritie of a master of a familie is distinct in kind from the authoritie of a magistrate a priuate person as a father or master when he teacheth the word of god he doth it by right of a master or father and he is mooued to doe it by the law of charitie but ministers when they teach are mooued to teach by speciall calling and they doe it with authoritie as embassadours in the roome and stead of christ corinthian againe though a priuate man might dispense the word alone yet doth it not follow that he may administer both the word and the seale thereof both which are ioyned in baptisme and ioyntly administred the second question is whether baptisme administred by a wicked man or an here ke be indeede true baptisme ans if the said partie be admitted to stand in the roome of a true pastour or minister and keepe the right forme in baptising according to the institution it is true baptisme the scribes and pharisies the chiesest doctours of the iewes were not of the tribe of levi but of other tribes and they were indeede euen the best of them but herelikes and apostataes and consequently to be deposed and excommunicate neuertheles because they were in the place of good teachers and fate in moses chaire that is taught sundrie points of moses doctrine therefore christ saith heare them math and to this effect was the conclusion of the churches in africa against cyprian vpon the same ground the same answer is to be made if it be demanded whether baptisme administred by him that cannot preach be of force or no it were indeede to be wished that all ministers of holy things were preachers of the word neuerthelesse if such as preach not stand in the roome of lawful pastours and keepe the forme of baptisme it is baptisme indeede the third question is whether an intention to baptise be necessarie in him that baptiseth ans if the word of institution come to the element it is a sacrament whatsoeuer the minister intend paul reioyced that christ was preached though many preached him of envy or contention intending no good philipp and the priest in the masse pronouncing the words of consecration if he intend not to consecrate in popish learning there is no consecration and thus the bread eleuated is meere bread and not the bodie of christ and consequently the people adore not christ but an idol the intention therefore of the minde is not necessarie so be it the institution be obserued and the efficacse of the sacrament depends not on the will of man but on the will of god the last question is what is the dutie of the minister in baptising ans he stands in the roome of god and what he doth according to the institution it is as much as if god himselfe had done it with his owne hand from heauen and therefore whe the minister applieth water which is the signe amp pledge of grace to the body he doth withall applie the promise of remission of sinnes and life euerlasting to the partie baptised and that is as much as if god should say to the partie calling him by his name i freely giue vnto thee the pardon of thy sinnes and life euerlasting vpon condition thou keepe the order set downe in baptisme which is to turne vnto me and to beleeue in christ here we see a ground of speciall faith for if god for his part by the hand of the minister applie the promise of mercie vnto euery particular beleeuer euery particular beleeuer is againe by a speciall faith to receiue the promise againe the consideration of this which god hath done for vs in baptisme must mooue vs seriously to turne vnto him according to all his lawes and by faith of our hearts to apprehend his mercifull promises and to rest on them for when god shall speake vnto vs particularly and as it were assure vs of his mercies with his owne hand and seale we must needs be much mooued and affected therewith the second circumstance is concerning the persons to be baptised and they are all such as be in the couenant in likelihood or in the iudgement of charitie for the seale may not be denied to them that bring the tables of the couenant and they are of two sorts man of yeares and infants man of yeares that ioyne themselues to the true church are to be baptised yet before their baptisme they are to make confession of their faith and to promise amendment of life act and and thus places of scripture that require actuall faith and amendment of life in them that are baptised are to be vnderstood of man of yeares infants of beleeuing parents are likewise to be baptised the grounds of their baptisme are these first the commandement of god matth baptize all nation ampc in which wordes the baptisme of infants is prescribed for the apostles by vertue of this commission baptised whole families act and againe circumcision of infants was commanded by god gen and baptisme in the new testament succeedes in the roome of circumcision column therefore baptisme of infants is likewise commanded the second ground is this infants of beleeuing parents are in the couenant of grace for this is the tenour of the couenant i will be thy god and the god of thy seede gen it may be said that this promise was made in this sort onely to abraham because he was to be the father of the faithfull ans it pertaines to all beleeuing parents exod god promiseth to shew mercie to thousands of them that loue him act peter saith to the iewes that heard him preach the promises belong to you and to your children paul saith if the parents beleeue the children are holy corinthian if holy then are they in the couenant now they are holy because we are in the iudgement of christian charitie to esteeme them all as regenerate and sanctified secret iudgements in the meane season left to god now then because infants are in the couenant they are to be baptised for this is the reason of s peter to whome the promises belong to them belongeth baptisme but to you and your children belong the promises therefore you and your children are to be baptised act it may be obiected that we cannot tell whether infants be indeede the children of god or no and if they be not children of god we may not baptize them answer the same may be said of man of yeares for we knowe not whether they be indeede the children of and therefore we may by the like reason exclude them from all sacraments againe we are to presume in all likelihood that infants of beleeuing parents are the children of god because in their conception and birth god begins to manifest his election shewing himselfe a god not onely to the parents but also to their seed secondly it is obiected that infants haue no faith and consequently that baptisme is vnprofitable vnto them ans some thinke they haue faith as they haue regeneration that is the inclination or seede of faith others say that the faith of the parents is also the faith of their children because the parents by their faith receiue the promise of god both for themselues amp their children and thus to be borne in the church of beleeuing parents is in stead of the profession of faith to this second opinion i rather incline because it is the auncient and receiued doctrine of the church thirdly it is alleadged that infants know not what is done when they are baptized ans for all this baptisme hath his vse in them for it is a seale of the couenant and a meanes to admit them into the fellowship of the visible church whereof for right they are members a father makes a purchasse for himselfe and his children at the time of the sealing the children know not what is done and yet the purchasse is not made in vaine for them it may be demanded whether the children of turkes and iewes are to be baptized answer no because the parents are forth of the couenant secondly it is demanded whether the children of professed papists are to be baptized answer the parents are persons baptized in the name of the father son and holy ghost and though the papacie be not the church of god yet is the church of god hidden in the papacie and to be gathered out of it and for this cause baptisme remaines still in the church of rome for this cause i thinke that infants of professed papists may be baptized two cautions obserued the first that the foresaid parents desire this baptisme the second that there be sureties which promise the education of the child in the true faith thirdly it may be demanded whether the children of wicked christians that is of such as hold in iudgement true religion and denie it in their liues may be baptized ans they may for all without exceptio that were borne of circumcized lews whereof many were wicked were circumcised and we must not onely regard the next parents but also the auncestours of whome it is said if the roote be holy the branches are holy rom vpon this ground children borne in fornication may be baptized so be it there be some to answer for them beside the parents and there is no reason that the wickednesse of the parent should preiudice the childe in things pertaining to life eternall lastly it may be demanded whether the children of parents excommunicate may be baptized answer yes if there be any beside the parents to answer for the child for the parents after excommunication remaine still for right members of the church hauing still a right to the kingdome of heauen out of which they are not cast absolutely but with condition vnlesse they repent and in part that is in respect of communion or vse of their libertie but not in respect of right or title euen as a freeman of a corporation imprisoned remaines a freeman though for the time he hath no vse of his libertie the third circumstance concernes the time here one question may be mooued how oft baptisme is to be administred answer but once for the efficacie of baptisme extends it selfe to the whole life of man and we are but once borne againe and once ingrafted into christ here let it be obserued that the gift of regeneration is neuer vtterly extinguished for if a man be the second time borne againe he must be baptized againe and againe because baptisme is the sacrament of insition it may be said that a man may remain stil ingrafted into christ amp by his own wickednesse make himselfe a dead member i answer that all the members of the mysticall bodie of christ are liuing mebers the spirituall temple is made of liuing stones pet and marke what paul saith all the bodie of christ increaseth with the increasing of god column and ephesians beleeuers are of the bone and flesh of christ nowe there is no part of the bone and flesh of christ that dieth the last circumstance is touching the place amp that is the publike assemblie or congregation of the people of god because baptisme is a part of the publike ministerie and a dependance vpon the preaching of the word of god secondly the whole congregation is to make profit by the enarration of the institution of baptisme and lastly the said congregation is by praier to present the infant baptized vnto god and to intreat for the saluation thereof the praier of many beeing most effectuall the eight and last point followes concerning the vse of baptisme and first of all our baptisme must put vs in minde that we are admitted and receiued into the family of god and consequently that we must carrie our selues as the servant of god and that we may doe so indeede we must deuide our liues into two parts the life past and life to come touching the life that is past we must performe three things the first is examination whereby we must call our selues to an account for all our sinnes euen from the cradle the second is confession whereby we must with sorrowfull hearts bewaile and acknowledge the same sinnes in the prefence of god accusing and condemning our selues for them the third is deprecation whereby we are to intreat the lord in the name of christ and that most instantly from day to day till we receiue a comfortable answer in the peace of conscience and ioy of the h ghost and for the life to come there must be two things in vs the first is the purpose of not sinning and it must be a liuely and distinct purpose daily renewed in vs euen as we renewe our daies so as we may say if we sinne it is against our purpose and resolution the second is an indeauour to performe new obedience according to all the commandements of god these things if we doe we shall shewe our selues to be the servant of god and of all these things baptisme must be as it were a daily sermon vnto vs and so oft to thinke on them as oft as we thinke or speake of our names giuen vs in baptisme this is the doctrine of paul who teacheth vs that we must be conformable to the death and resurrection of christ because we haue beene baptized rom againe our baptisme into the name of the father ampc must teach vs that we must learne to know and acknowledge god aright that is to acknowledge him to be our god and father in christ to acknowledge his presence and therefore to walke before him to acknowledge his prouidence and therefore to cast our care on him to acknowledge his goodnesse and mercie in the pardon and free forgiuenesse of our sinnes thirdly our baptisme must be vnto vs a storehouse of all comfort in the time of our need if thou be tempted by the devil oppose against him thy baptisme in which god hath promised and seal d vnto thee the pardon of thy sinnes and life euerlasting if thou be troubled with doubtings and weaknes of faith consider that god hath giuen thee an earnest and pledge of his louing kindnes to thee we vse often to look vpon the wills of our fathers and grand fathers that we may be resolued in matters of doubt and so often looke vpon the will of thy heauenly father sealed and deliuered to thee in thy baptisme and thou shalt the better be resolued in the middest of all thy doubts if thou lie vnder any crosse or calamitie haue recourse to thy baptisme in which god promised to be thy god and of this promise he will not faile thee lastly if a man would be a student in diuinitie let him learne amp practise his baptisme commentaries are needefull to the studie of the scriptures and the best commentarie to a mans owne selfe is his owne baptisme for if a man haue learned to know ought and to practise his owne baptisme he shall the better be able to vnderstand the whole and without this helpe the scriptures themselues shall be as a riddle vnto vs the point whereby the gift of adoption is described is the ground thereof in these words ye haue put on christ and all are one in christ the phrase which paul vseth is borrowed from the custome of them that were baptised in the apostes daies who put off their garments when they were to be baptised and put on new garments after baptisme to put on a garment is to apply it to the bodie and to vse or weare it and to put on christ is to be ioyned neerely to christ and to haue spirituall fellowship with him here then the foundation of our adoption is in two things our vnion with christ amp our communion with him of which we are somewhat to be aduertised for the better vnderstanding of the text the vnion with christ is a worke of god whereby all beleeuers are made one with christ here two questions are to be demanded the first in what respect or for what cause are they said to be one with christ ans they are not one with him in conceit or imagination for this coniunction is in truth a reall coniunction john christ prooues that all beleeuers may be one with him as he is one with the father secondly they are not one barely by consent of heart and affection for thus all families and friends are one and they of ierusalem are said thus to be of one heart and mind act thirdly they are not one in substance for so many beleeuers as there are so many distinct persons are there amp euery one of them distinct from the person of christ and the substance of the godhead of christ is incommunicable and the flesh of christ is in heauen and shall there abide till the last iudgement whereupon it cannot be mixed or compounded with our substances lastly beleeuers are not one with christ by transfusion of the properties and qualities of the godhead or manhood vnto vs it may be said how then are they one with him i answer by one and the same spirit dwelling in christ and in all the members of christ corinthian he that cleaueth to the lord is one spirit paul saith in this sense ephesians that christ maketh the two distinct nation of iewes and gentiles one new man s john saith that christ dwells in vs and we in him by the spirit john for the better conceiuing of this suppose a man whose head lies in italie his armes in germany and spaine his feete in england suppose further that one and the same soule extends it selfe to all the foresaid parts and quickens them all they are all now become one in respect of one and the same soule and all concurre as members to one and the same bodie euen so all the saints in heauen and all beleeuers vpon earth hauing one and the same spirit of christ dwelling in them are all one in christ the second question is how are all beleeuers made one with christ ans by a donation on god part whereby christ is giuen vnto vs and by a receiuing on our part the donation is whereby christ is made ours for right so as a man may say truly christ is mine with all his benefits of this donation things are to be obserued the first is that christ himselfe and whole christ is giuen to vs for heere we are said to put on christ here a distinction must be obserued the godhead of christ is giuen to vs not in respect of substance which is incommunicable but only in respect of operation but the very flesh or manhood of christ is really giuen to the beleeuing heart ioh by it we receiue eternall life from the godhead and by it god is ioyned to man and man to god the second is that christ giues his merit and satisfaction to them that beleeue and this satisfaction imputed is the couer wherby our sinnes are couered psalm and the white robes dipped in the blood of christ reu thirdly christ giues the efficacie of his spirit to make vs conformable to himselfe in holines and newnes of life and thus he makes vs put off the old man and put on the new man created after god in righteousnes and holines ephesians the fourth is that the word preached and the sacraments are as it were the hand of god whereby he exhibits and giues christ vnto vs with all his benefits of our receiuing of christ giuen by god two things must be obserued one is that we must there receiue christ where god offers and giues him that is in the word and sacraments the second is that faith is our hand wherby we receiue christ and this receiuing is done by a supernaturall act of the minde whereby we beleeue christ with his benefits to be ours ioh thus we see how we are one with christ and christ with vs communion with christ is when we haue possesse and inioy christ and his benefits and that is partly in this life and fully in the life to come of this communion speakes salomon at large in the song of songs and dauid psalm the vse in that we are to put on christ we are put in mind to consider our fearefull nakednes what is that ans there is a nakednes of creation and a nakednes following the fall the nakednes of creation is when the bodie without all couering is in health full of glorie and maiestie in respect of other creatures nakednes arising of the fall of man is either inward or outward inward is the want of the image of god the want of innocencie of good conscience of the fauour of god and affiance in him for these are as it were the couerings of the foule outward nakednes is when the bodie beeing vncouered is full of deformitie and shame now that inward nakednes of heart is noted as a speciall euill gen exod prou reu we must labour to see and feele this nakednes in our selues for by it we are desormed and odious in the eye of god secondly we are here put in minde to haue a speciall care of the trimming and garnishing of our soule and for this cause we must put on the lord iesus rom and that is done two waies first by vncouering our nakednes before god and by praying him to couer it to vncouer our shame is the way to couer it psalm the second way is to subiect our selues to the word and spirit of god and to be conformable to christ both in his life and death it stands vs in hand thus to put on christ for the king of heauen hath long inuited vs to the marriage of his son we haue yeilded our selues to be his guests and there is a time when the king will take a suruay of all his guests whether they haue the wedding garment which is christ himselfe and they which are not clad with this robe shall be cast into vtter darknes we are as naked infants exposed to death ezech the merit and obedience of christ is as swadling cloth and swadling bands if we would then liue we must lappe and infold our selues in them the rather i speake this because in these daies man and woman are intoxicated with a spirituall drunkennes or rather madnesse whereby they are alwaies tempering and trifling about their body and let their soules lie naked it may be said we haue all put on christ in baptisme i answer we haue had in england peace and prosperitie this yeares and we haue liued all this while as it were in the warme sun shine and therfore many of vs no doubt haue worne this garment very loosely thirdly there is a great temptation arising vpon the consideration of our owne indignitie for when our sinnes come to our remembrance they driue vs from the presence of god and make vs that we dare not pray now the remedie is this we must come clothed with christ into the presence of god we may not come in our owne names but we must come in his name and present the merit of christ vnto the father euen as if we were one and the same person with him thus shall we be accepted fourthly it may be demanded what we must doe for our selues in the time of plague famine sword we must put on christ then shall we walke in safetie in all dangers this garment serues not onely for a couering of our shame but also for protection isa and if we be taken away in any common iudgement beeing clothed with christ there is no more hurt done to vs then to him and he carrieth vs in his brest as if we were part of his bowells lastly though we be clothed with christ in baptisme yet we must further desire to be clothed vpon corinthian in this life we are clad with the iustice of christ corinthian this is one garment in the life to come we shall be clad with immortalitie this is the second garment to be vpon the former v there is neither iewe nor greek ampc these words as i haue said containe an answer to an obiection which is this if all beleeuers among the gentiles be children of god and all put one christ then there is no difference betweene iewe and gentile and the prerogatiue of the iewe is nothing paul answers thus there be sundrie differences of man in respect of nation condition sexe yet in respect of christ all are one moreouer i haue shewed that these words containe the groud of the adoption of the galatians which is an vnion with christ whereby all beleeuers are made one with him there remaine other things to be added by occasion of this text two questions are mooued the answer whereof serues much to cleare the meaning of paul the first is whether magistracie and gouernment be necessarie in the societies of christians ans yes kings and queens shall be nourcing fathers and nourcing mothers to the church of god saith the prophet isai paul bids vs praie for kings and all in authoritie that we may line in peace and godlines tim the fift commandement honour thy father ampc requires subiection to authoritie and this commandement is eternall obiect i all beleeuers are one in christ therefore there is no subiection among them ans beleeuers are vnder a twofold estate or regiment the first is the regiment of this world in ciuill societie the second is the regiment or the kingdome of heauen which stands in iustice peace of conscience ioy in the holy ghost in the first estate there are sundrie differences of persons that beleeue some fathers and mothers some children some masters and servant some magistrates and subiects in the second estate there are no outward differences of man but all are members of christ and all one in him thus must the text be vnderstood obiect ii beleeuers are gouerned by god spirit and therefore outward gouernment by magistrates is needlesse answer in the visible church hypocrites are mingled with true beleeuers and they are not gouerned by god spirit but by the spirit of the deuill and therefore in respect of them ciuill authoritie is requisite againe true beleeuers are but in part gouerned by the spirit for the time of this life and for this cause ciuill gouernment is requisite for the ordering of the outward man and for the protection of the church obiect iii they that are in christ are freed from sinne and consequently from subiection which followes vpon sinne answer subiection is either politic or seruile politicke is when man are subiect for their own good and this was before the fall yeilded by eve to adam seruile subiection when they are subiect for the good of their masters and this onely comes of sinne againe subiection with ioy was before the fall subiection ioyned with paine and miserie followes vpon sinne gen the second question is whether bondage in which some are lord others bond man or slaues may stand with christian religion answer it may in the country where it is established by positiue lawes if it be vsed with mercie and moderation righteons abraham had in his owne house bondslaues gen god did permit the iewes to buy the children of the canaanites leuit paul saith if any man be calied beeing a servant or bondman let him not care for it corinthian obiect i be not servant of man corinthian ans that is in respect of conscience the subiection whereof must be reserued to god obiect ii christians haue libertie by christ and where libertie is there may be no bondage answer christians obtaine by christ spirituall libertie in this life and bodily libertie in the life to come obiect iii bondage is against the lawe of nature answer against the law of pure nature created in innocencie not against the lawe of corrupt nature the fruite whereof is bondage obiect iu all are one in christ therefore the difference of bond man and free man must cease ans all are one in respect of the inward man or in respect of faith and fellowship with christ but all are not one in respect of the outward man and in regard of ciuill order the sense then of the text is this there are distinctions of man in respect of nation some iewes some gentiles in respect of condition some bonde some free some rich some poore some in authoritie some in subiection ampc in respect of sexe some man some woman yet in christ iesus all are euen as one man the vse by this text we may expound another tim god would haue all man to be saued that is not all particular persons vpon earth but all kinds for here paul saith all are one in christ that is man of all nation of all conditions and of all sexes againe the name jewe apposed to gentiles signifies not onely man of the tribe of iuda but all circumcized persons of all tribes rom and thus it is all one with an israelite and thus we see howe to expound the place of scripture chronicle where iehosaphat king of iuda is called king of israel the words iuda and israel are sometime opposed iuda signifying the kingdome of the two tribes iuda and beniamin and israel signifying the tribes sometimes againe they are synonima and are put one for another as psalm and in this text and iuda at this time was indeed the true israel of god and iehosaphat without any fault in the text as some suppose is truely called king of israel thirdly they which are of great byrth and of heigh condicion must be pnt in mind not to be heigh minded nor to dispise them that are of lowe degree for all are one in christ the obscure and base person hath as good part in christ as the greatest man that be therefore we may not swell in pride for outward things the king must not lift vp his hart against his brother deut rich man saith paul must not be high minded tim iob would not despise the cause of his handmaid iob naaman a great man respected the counsell of his servant king fourthly all beleeuers must be on hart and mind corinthian in the kingdome of christ the wolfe and the lamb dwell together isai and good reason for all are on in christ and we haue great cause to be humbled when schismes coutentions and differences arise in points of religion for that shewes that hypocrites are mingled with true beleeuers and that we are but in part as yet vnited to christ lastly hence we learne not to hate any man but alwaies to carrie in mind a purpose to doe good to all by thought word and deed and to doe good to man in respect of their names their goods their liues and this wholy mind and purpose must alwaies beare sway in vs there is no hurt in the mount of the lord isai man turne their swords amp speares into mattocks amp sithes that are of the kingdom of christ isai because they are one with christ by the bond of on spirit v and if ye be christs then are ye abrahams seed and heires by promise before paul had taught v that all beleeuing gentiles were the children of abraham and not the iewes only here he returnes to the same point againe and prooues it by a new argument thus christ is the seed of abraham v and all gentiles beleeuing in christ are parts of him and one with him therefore they also are children of abraham and heires of all the blessings of god the intent of paul in these words is to establish and confirme an argument which before he had vrged in this chapter against patrons of workes in the case of our iustification it may be framed thus as abraham was iustified so are all they that beleeue in christ instified for they are abr ams children and succeed him v but abraham was iustified by faith without workes therefore all beleeuers in christ are so iustified let the argument be obserued for it makes against the papist who if he studie till his head and heartake shall neuer answer it in this verse paul sets down the fruit and banefit that comes by the gift of adoption to them that beleeue and that is to be children of abraham and heires of all the blessings of god and therefore learne here one golden lesson namely that the basest person that is if he beleeue in christ is in the place of abraham and succeeds him in the inheritance of the kingdom of heauen some man may say o this is excellent comfort if i might know that i were in the case of abraham answer thou maist know it certenly if thou wilt doe as abraham did namely follow the calling of god and obey the gospel that is subiect thy heart to the commandements of god which bidde thee repent and beleeue in christ for then all the good things reuealed in the gospel shall be thine the vse beleeuers in this world must be content with any estate that god shall lay vpon them for they are heires with abraham of heuen and earth in this regard abraham was content to forsake his country and his fathers house and as a pilgrime to dwell in tents to the death heb secondly they that beleeue in christ must moderate their worldly cares and not liue as drudges of the world for they are heires of god and haue a title or right to all good things promised in the couenant therefore they shall neuer want any good thing that is needfull for them he that hath made them heires will carefully prouide for them therefore our care must be to doe the duties that belong vnto vs and all other cares we must cast vpon god they in this world that are borne to land and liuing are content to liue sparingly and oftentimes very barely with a little vpon hope of further enlargement after the decease of some friends lastly our speciall care must be for heauen for the things of this world are but trifles in respect the citie of god in heauen is thy portion or childs part seeke for the assurance of that aboue all things thus did abraham heb and i say that the heire as long as he is a child differeth nothing fro a servant though he be lord of all but is vnder tutors amp gouernors till the time appointed of the father euen so we when we were children were in bondage vnder the rudiments of the world but when the fulnesse of time was come god sent forth his son made of a woman and made vnder the law that he might redeeme them that were vnder the lawe that we might receiue the adoption of sonns and because ye are sonnes god hath sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts which crieth abba father wherefore thou article no more a servant but a son and if thou be a son thou article also an heire of god through christ these words depend on the former chapter as an answer to an obiection which may be framed on this manner paul thou saiest that the iewes before christ were vnder the law as vnder a schoolemaster c v and that we are free from the same schoolemaster v beeing children of god and heires by christ v but we for our parts thinke our selues servant vnder the law as well as the ancient iewes and that they are as well children of god as we to this obiection paul makes answer in these verses as the very first words import and i say that is whatsoeuer you suppose i say thus and then he propounds the reason of his answer which may be framed thus if the time of our bondage be ended and the full time of our libertie come then are we sonnes and not servant but the time of our bondage is ended and the full time of our libertie is come therefore we are not servant but sonnes the major is omitted because it is manifest the minor is in the sixe first verses the conclusion is expressed in the verse againe the minor the time of our bondage is ended and the time of our libertie is come is first of all declared by a similitude and then confirmed the similitude is borrowed from the ciuill law and it may be framed thus heires in their minoritie liue in subiection to tutors and gouernours but when they are of riper yeares at the appointment of their parents they are at their owne libertie euen so the people of god before christ were in their infancie vnder the law as vnder a tutor but when the fulnes of time was come which god had appointed they entred into the fruition of their libertie the first part of the similitude is expressed in the first verses and the second in the and againe the minor is confirmed by two reasons the first is this your libertie is procured by christ therefore the time of your libertie is come this reason is in the and verses the second reason is taken from the signe you haue receiued the spirit of adoption therefore the time of your libertie is come v of these points in order first where he signifies that the father hath authoritie to dispose of his child this is the law of nature and the law of nation paul saith column that children must obay their parents in all things when the deuill had obtained libertie to afflict iob in all things that belonged to him saue his person he destroied his children iob and this shewes that the children in respect of their body are the goods of their parents in this respect the iewes were permitted to sell their children exod and so sacred a thing was the authoritie of the parent that he which rebelliously despised the same was put to death deu this authoritie shewes it selfe specially in two things in the marriage and in the calling of the child in the marriage of the child the parent is the principall agent and the disposer thereof deuter exod corinthian where obserue that the commandement touching the marriage of the child is giuen not to the child but to the parent and the parent hath authoritie by the saide commaundement to giue and bestow his child and to take wiues to his sonnes thus abraham tooke a wife for isaac and isaac suffered himselfe to be disposed at the appointment of his father for a more full declaration of this authoritie i propound these three questions the first is whether the father may command his childe to marrie ans presuppose two things one that the commandement is without compulsion the second that the father knowes what is for the good of the child then i answer that he may command his child to marrie and to marrie a person thus or thus qualified thus isaac commanded iacob to marrie in the house of laban gen and iacob obaied now whether a father may command his child to marrie this or that person i doubt and therefore suspend the second question is whether parents may make voide the contract secretly made by their children without or against their consent ans the scripture giueth them authoritie either to ratifie such contracts or to make them void number the father may make void the vow of the child pertaining to god worship much more a matrimoniall promise if a yong man deflowre a maide and this be found in equitie he is to be compelled to marrie her deut yet by god law this may not be except the father consent exod the third question is whether a marriage made without and against the consent of parents be a marriage or no ans it may be called a politicke or ciuill marriage because it is ratified in the courts of man according to humane lawes and by this meanes the ishue is freed from bastardie neuerthelesse it is not a diuine or spirituall coniunction or marriage as it ought to be because it is flat against the commandement of god touching the callings of children they are to be ordered and appointed at the discretion of parents for if the parent may order the vowe and the marriage of the child then much more the calling here take notice of the impietie of the romane religion there are three especiall estates whereby man liues in societie with man the church the commonwealth the familie in the church that religion sets vp another head beside christ in the commonwealth it sets vp an authoritie that serues to curb and restraine the supremacie of princes in causes ecclesiasticall in the familie it puts downe the authoritie of the father for it ratifieth clandestine contracts and it giues libertie to children past twelue or fourteene yeares of age to enter into any order of religion against the consent of their parents againe parents must be put in minde to know their authoritie to maintaine it and to vse it aright for the good of their children specially for their saluation and children must be warned in all things honest and lawful to yeeld subiection to their parents and in this subiection shall they find the blessing of god againe here is set downe the office of parents and that is to prouide meete ouerseers and tutors for their children after their departure when christ vpon the crosse had the pangs of death vpon him he commends his mother to the tuition of john ioh when widdowes and orphanes are wronged god himself takes vpon him the office of a tutor in their behalfe exod and this shewes that it is a necessary dutie to be thought vpon thirdly here the dutie of children is set downe and that is that they must be subiect to their tutors and gouernours as to their owne fathers and mothers ruth loued naomi and claue vnto her as to her owne mother ruth christ was subiect to ioseph who was but a reputed father luke last the sonnes of the prophets obay their masters as their owne fathers king and so doe the servant to their master king nowe i come to the second part of the similitude v euen so we that is the iewes and all the people of god in the olde testament were children were as children in respect of the christian church in the new testament were in bondage the iewes are said to be in bondage in respect of vs because they were subiect to more lawes then we are and they wanted the fruition of the liberty which we inioy they had the right of sonnes but they inioyed not their right as we doe and this is their bondage for otherwise libertie in conscience fro hell death amp sin they had euen as we now haue rudiments of the world that is the lawe or ministerie of moses and it is so called in respect of a more full and plentifull doctrine in the ministerie of the newe testament and it is called the rudiments of the world because iewrie was as it were a little schoole set vp in a corner of the world the lawe of moses was as it were an a b c or primar in which christ was reuealed to the world in darke and obscure manner specially to the iewes the vse here we see that the people of the old testament were for right heires as well as we and therefore they had right to all the blessings of god the difference betweene vs and them is onely in the manner which god vsed in dispensing the foresaid blessings to vs againe the fathers of the olde testament before christ were but as children in respect of vs now thus much saith paul in expresse words and they were so two waies first in respect of the mosaicall regiment because they were kept in subiection to more lawes then we secondly they were so in respect of reuelation because god hath reuealed more to vs then to them read luke it may be said we now are the best of vs but children to abraham and the prophets whether we respect knowledge or faith answer it is so if we compare person and person but it is otherwise if we compare bodie with bodie and compare the christian church with the church of the iewes before christ then we exceede them and they are but children to vs this must teach vs all to be carefull to increase in knowledge and in the grace of god that we may be answerable to our condition and to liue in ignorance as the most doe is the shame of vs all for in respect of the time we should all be teachers heb and yet god knows the most are very babes for aske a man how he lookes to be saued he will answer by seruing god and by dealing truely now his seruing of god is his saying of his praiers and his praiers are the beleefe and the ten commandements this is a poore seruing of god fitter for babes then for man of yeares it is further to be obserued that paul saith the fathers of the old testament were in bondage vnder the lawe after the manner of servant specially by reason of rites amp ceremonies and hence it followes that the obseruation of a religion in which are manifold bodily rites and figures is a kind of bondage and pertaines to the church for the time of her infancie or minority let this be remembred against the roman religion for it is like to that of the iewes in the olde testament standing for the greatest part in bodily rites in differences of meates and drinkes in differences of times places garments in exercises and afflictions of the bodie in locall succession in the collation of grace by the worke done and such like this is manifest to them which know the masse which indeede is nothing but a masse of ceremonies therefore the romane religion is a childish and babish religion and if it were of god yet is it not fit for the church of the newe testament that is come forth of her minoritie religion that stands in the afflicting of the body is but a shadow and an appearance of humilitie column and the true worshippers of god in the new testament worship him in spirit and trueth ioh v the fulnesse of time or the full time is that time in which the captiuitie of the church endeth and her libertie begins this time was ended yeares from the creation and it is called a full time because it was designed and appointed by the will amp prouidence of the heauenly father for he is lord of time and all seasons are in his hand and his will or prouidence makes times fit or vnfit marke then that is the onely full and fit time for the inioying of any blessing of god which he by his prouidence appointeth this must teach vs when by praier we aske any good thing at god hand not to prescribe any time vnto god but to leaue it to his prouidence againe if thou liue in any miserie waite on the lord and be content for that is the fit amp best time of thy deliuerace which god hath appointed lastly thou must be admonished to pray to god for grace and mercie and to turne to him this daie before to morrowe for this is the time which god hath appointed for these duties this is the day of grace and therefore the onely fit time heb psalm thus much of the similitude nowe i come to the first reason whereby paul confirmes his maine argument christ hath purchased and procured your libertie therefore the time therof is come and past for the better clearing of this reason paul sets downe the waie and order which was vsed in procuring this libertie and it containes fiue degrees the first is the sending of the son the second his incarnation the third his subiection to the law the fourth our redemption from the laws the fift the fruition of our adoption v the first the sending of the son is in these words in the fulnesse of time god sent forth his son that we may attaine to the sense of this great mysterie sixe questions are to be propounded the first is what is meant by god answer the father the first person ephesians blessed he god the father of our lord iesus christ corinthian and ioh and he is called god not because he partakes more of the godhead then the son or the h ghost but because he is the first in order of the three diuine persons and he is the beginning of the son and the h ghost and hath no beginning of his own person because he doth not receiue the godhead by communication from any other in this respect he is called god more commonly then the son or the holy ghost the second question is how the father sends the son answer by his counsell and eternall decree whereby the son was designed to the office of a mediatour and consequently to become man act and thus is he said to be sealed of the father ioh and to be sanctified and sent into the world ioh and therefore this sending implies no alteration or change of place the third question is whether the son was sent with his owne consent or no ans yes the decree of the father is the decree of the son and the holy ghost because as they are all one in nature so are they all one in will all the persons then haue a stroke in this sending yet for orders false the father is said to send because he is first the fourth question is how the father can send the son considering they are both one ans in the doctrine touching the trinitie nature and person must be distinguished n ture is a substance common to many as the godhead a person is that which subsisteth of it selfe and hath a proper manner of subsisting as the father begetting the son begotten the h ghost proceeding now the father and the son are one indeed for nature or godhead but they are not one for person nay thus they are really distinct the father is not the son nor the son the father and thus doth the father send the son the fift question is why the son is so called ans because he was begotten of the father by a perfect and eternall generation not to be vttered of man or conceiued and we must be warned not to conceiue it in any carnall or humane manner for an earthly father is in time before his son and the son after but god the father and the son are coeternall and not one before or after the other for time an earthly father is forth of the son and the son forth of the father but god the father is in the son and the son in the father an earthly child is from his father by propagation but the son is from the heauenly father not by propagation but by communication of substance lastly the heauenly father begettes the son by communication of his whole substance and so doth no earthly father the last question is whether the son be god for it is here said god sent his son ans he is god for he that is sent forth from god was before he was sent forth and the son is said to be sent forth because he was with god the father before all worlds ioh and because he came from the bosome of his father v obiect i the son is sent of the father and he that is sent is inferiour to the father and he that is inferiour to god is not god ans two equalls by common consent may send each other and therefore sending alwaies implies not inequalitie againe inferioritie is of two sorts inferioritie of nature and inferioritie of condition the first doth not befall christ because for nature he is one and the same with the father the second agrees vnto him because of his owne voluntarie accord he abased himselfe and tooke vpon him the shape of a man philipp obiect ii god hath his beginning of none the son hath his beginning of the father therefore he is not god ans the son in respect of his person is of the father but in respect of his godhead he is of none the son of god considered as he is a son is of the father god of very god but considered as he is god he is god of himselfe because the godhead of the son is not begotten more then the godhead of the father obiect iii the son was made lord in time act therefore no god ans christ as he is the son of god was not made lord in time but is by nature an eternall lord as the father and he is said to be made lord in respect of his condition as he is god man and that in time in respect of both his natures in respect of his manhood because it is receiued into the vnitie of the second person and exalted to the right hand of god in heauen in respect of his godhead the maiestie and lordship whereof he declared and made manifest in the flesh after his resurrection thus was he made lord by declaring himselfe to be so indeede rom tim thus we see how god sent forth his son the vse follows this act of god in sending declares his infinite loue for this sending was for their sakes that were the enemy of god and it further signifies vnto vs the most free loue of god for nothing in vs mooued him to send but his owne goodnes this loue of god must mooue vs to loue god againe and to be thankfull the son of god takes not to himselfe the office of a mediatour but he is called and sent forth of the father whereby two things are signified one that the office of a mediatour was appointed of the father the other that the son was designed to this office in the eternall counsell of the blessed trinitie and so that we may please god in our callings and places we must haue a double assurance in our consciences one that the offices and callings which we performe are good amp pleasing vnto god the second that we are designed and called of god to the said offices and callings by this must we stay our minds in all our miseries the son is sent forth that is he comes from his father laies aside his maiestie and takes on him the condition of a servant the same minde must be in vs to humble and abase our selues before god to thinke better of others then of our selues to be content with our condition to be well pleased when we are despised and contemned because we are worthie of it this is to conforme our selues to christ that the son of god himselfe must be sent forth from the bosome of his father this shewes the greatnes of our sinne and miserie which was the occasion of this sending and this must teach vs with bitternes to hate and detest our sinnes which fetched the son of god from heauen and to humble our selues with dauid euen to the deepes and thence to pray to god for his mercie psalm the second point namely the incarnation of the son is expressed in these words made of a woman that is made man or made flesh of a woman the word was made flesh ioh here three questions are to be handled the first is why the son was made flesh ans there be two speciall causes hereof first the order of diuine iustice requires that god wrath should be appeased and a satisfaction made in the same nature in which his maiestie was offended now the offence was in mans nature and therefore in it must satisfaction to god be performed secondly the mediatour betweene god and man must be both for nature and condition in the meane betweene god and man that is both god and man and thus the son of god is a perfect mediatour the second question is how farre forth the son of god was made flesh i answer three things the first that he tooke vnto him the whole and perfect nature of man in respect of essence namely the intire substance of a reasonable soule and humane bodie here remember that quantitie that is length breadth and thicknes is not an accident which may passe and repasse but it is of the substance of euery bodie amp therefore of the bodie of christ and for this cause it is impossible that the bodie of christ in his quantitie beeing foure or fiue foote in length should be included in the compasse of a peece of bread that is but two or three inches in quantitie the second is that the son of god ooke vnto him the properties of mans nature the powers of life sense motion the facultie of reason will and affection the third is that he tooke to him the infirmities and miseries of mans nature here two caueats must be remembred the first that he tooke to him onely such infirmities as are meere infirmities and no sinnes for example vpon the words of christ let this cuppe passe matth some say that their was obliuion in christ but this may not be said for obliuion is a sinne namely a forgetting of that which a man ought to remember amp there may be in christ or other man a suspending of the memorie by some externall and violent cause without obliuion the second caueat is that the son of god tooke to him the infirmities which pertaine to the nature of man and not such as pertaine to the persons of man as dropsies gouts consumption and such like for he tooke not the person of any man but the nature of all man with all the appurtenances thereof except sinne the third question is how was he made flesh ans the flesh or manhood of christ was first framed then sanctified and then vn ted to the godhead of the son and thus was he made man remember here that the forming of the flesh of christ the sanctifying of it and the personall vnion are all together for time and i distinguish them in this sort onely for doctrines sake in the framing of the manhood i consider the matter and the manner the matter was the substance of the virgin signified in these words made of a woman by this christ is distinguished from all man in the world from adam because he was neither of man nor woman but of edde clay from eue because shee was made of man and not of woman from all that come of adam and eue for they are both of man and woman whereas christ is of woman and not of man againe paul addes these words made of a woman to note the accomplishment of the promise the seede of the woman shall bruise the serpents head gen the manner of framing is expressed when paul saith made not begotten of a woman the manhood then of christ was framed without naturall generation by an extraordinarie worke of the holy ghost here a doubt is answered some man may say if he were made of a woman he comes of adam and consequently he is a sinner ans the order set downe by god with adam in the creation is that whatsoeuer he looseth all his posteritie shall loose that comes of him by generation vpon this order all that are begotten of adam with the nature of man receiue the sinne and corruption of nature and so should christ haue done if he had descended of adam by generation but considering his flesh was made of the substance of a woman and not begotten of any man therefore he takes the nature of man and not the corruption of nature the sanctifying of the manhood of christ is a worke of diuine power whereby at the time of the framing thereof it was filled with the gifts of the holy ghost aboue measure that he mightin both natures be a perfect sauiour here obserue that christ by the actions of his life did not merit for himselfe glorie and eternall happines because he was most worthie of all glorie and honour at the very first moment of his conception againe obserue that christ in his manhood increased in grace as in age and stature luke and this increase was without all imperfection for in his infancie christ receiued a full measure of grace fit for that age when he was twelue yeares old he receiued a further measure fit for that age and so when he was thirtie yeares old and thus increase of grace and the perfection thereof stand both together and this increase is not onely in respect of experience and the manifestation of grace before god and man but also in respect of the habit or gift though the schooles for yeares haue taught the contrarie euer since the daies of lumbard the third thing is the vniting of flesh to the godhead of the son and that is done when the son of god makes the flesh or nature of man a part of himselfe and communicates vnto it his owne subsistance the like example to this is not to be found againe in the world yet haue we some resemblance of this mysterie in the plant called misselto which hath no roote of his owne but growes in a tree of an other kinde and thence receiues his sappe and so the manhood of the son hath no personalitie or personall subsistance but is receiued into the vnitie of the second person and is sustained of it it must here be obserued that there is a difference betweene the manhood of christ and all other man peter is a person subsisting of himselfe and so is paul and euery particular man but so is not the manhood of christ and therefore it is to be tearmed a nature and not a person and it is no disgrace but an exaltation to the nature of man that is subsists by the vncreated subsistance of the second person it may be obiected that all beleeuers are ioyned to the son of god as well as the flesh of christ i answer they are so but in an other kind and in a lower degree by communication of grace and not by communication of personall subsistance thus we see how the son was made flesh the vse follows hence we learne to vse all meanes that we may become newe creatures and be borne of god god becomes man that we man might be partakers of the diuine nature christ is made bone of our bone and flesh of our flesh by his incarnation that we might be made bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh by regeneration the son of god was made the son of man that we which are the sonnes of man might be made the sonnes of god to be made flesh is the abasement of the son in this abasement he goes on till he become euen as a worme of the earth psalm so must we abase our selues till we be anihillated and brought to nothing then shall we be like to christ and filled with the good things of god our sinnes are a wall of partition betweene god and vs so as we are farre from god and god from vs isa and this partition is of our own making and by this means we haue no accesse to god of our selues though we pray vnto him and fill heauen and earth with our crie now the son of god made man is immanuel that is god with vs isai and his incarnation is a meanes whereby we haue accesse to god and he is nere vnto vs when we pray vnto him in trueth chronicle this must teach vs to drawe nere to god in the hearing and obeying of his word in praier and in the vse of the holy sacraments if this be not done great is our wickednesse and great shall be the punishment iob psalm the incarnation of christ is the foundation of all our comfort and all good things which we inioy by it god comforts adam the seed of the woman shall brnise the serpents head iacob is comforted by the vision of a ladder reaching from heauen to earth and this ladder is the son of god made man ioh iob comforts himselfe in this that his redeemer of his own flesh as the word signifieth liueth iob in the old testament they which sought vnto god came to the arke or propitiatorie and there were they heard and receiued the blessings of god now christ god and man is in stead of the arke rom and therefore we must come to him if we would receiue any good thing of god the godhead is the fountaine of all good things and the flesh or manhood is a pipe or conduit to conuaie the same vnto vs if we would then receiue true comfort we must hunger and thirst in our hearts after christ and by our faith eate his flesh and drinke his blood ioh the third point or degree is the subiection of the son of god to the lawe expressed in these words made vnder the lawe here two questions are to be answered the first is who is made subiect to the law i answer the son of god and this may not seeme strange that he which is lord of the law should be subiect to the law for he must be considered as he is our pledge and suretie heb and as one that standes in our place roome and stead and before god represents the person of all the elect and in this respect is he subiect to the lawe not by nature but by voluntarie abasement and condition of will the second question is how the son of god was subiect to the lawe answer by a twofold obedience namely by the obedience of his passion and by his obedience in fulfilling the lawe the obedience of his passion stands before god as a satisfaction for the breach of the law in it consider two things the foundation of the passion and the passion it selfe the foudation is that the son of god was made sinne for vs corinthian that is all the sinnes of all the elect were imputed to him and he in our roome and place was recounted a sinner the passion it selfe is the curse of the law laid on the son of god namely the first death and the paines of the second death which is in effect and substance the paines of hell as i haue shewed in the chap v of this epistle by the second obedience in fulfilling the lawe the son of god performed for vs all things contained therein that we might haue right to life euerlasting and that according to the tenour of the law leuit doe all these things and liue of this obedience questions are demanded the first is whether it be necessarie for the iustification of a sinner answer it is the summe of the lawe is loue god with all thy heart and thy neighbour as thy selfe now euery iot and title of the lawe must necessarily be fulfilled math much more then the summe and substance of the lawe and it cannot be fulfilled by vs beeing sinners therefore there must needs be a translation of the lawe from our persons to the person of the mediatour who is to accomplish euery iot of the law for vs againe he that doth not all things contained in the law is cursed gal he therefore that would eschewe the curse of the law and come to life euerlasting must by himselfe accomplish all things contained in the law and if this cannot be done the law and all the contents thereof must needs be accomplished in the person of the mediatour otherwise the curse cannot be auoided lastly we owe vnto god a double debt or tribute the first is homage or subiection to be performed with all the powers of the soule amp with all the strength of all the powers and that from the first conception the second is a satisfactio by death for the breach of the law and the lawe is the bond that binds vs to the paiment of this double debt and till the iustice of god in the law be answered to the full this bond cannot be cancelled therefore the son of god the mediatour must not onely die for vs but also performe homage for vs to god according to the tenour of the law therefore he saith that he must performe all righteousnesse math and paul that christ is the end of the law for righteousnesse rom it is alleadged that christ as man fulfilled the lawe for himselfe and therefore not for vs ans the flesh or manhood of christ considered by it selfe apart from the godhead of the son is a creature that owes homage vnto god yet if it be considered as it is receiued into the vnitie of the second person and is become a part thereof it is exempted from the common condition of all other man and is not bound to performe subiection as all man are for if the son of man be lord of the sabboth then also is he lord of the whole law and paul here saith that the son of god is not borne but made vnder the lawe againe it is alleadged that the blood of christ taketh away all sinne ioh and when all sinne is taken away the law is fulfilled and the person iustified ans when s john saith the blood of christ purgeth vs from all sin he excludes the blood of beast and all meritorious means of saluation in man out of christ amp he excludes not the obedience which the mediatour yeelded to the father in all his sufferings againe it is not true that a sinner is iustified when all sinne is abolished vnlesse iustice be added for iustification is an alteration of a sinner from one cotrarie to another from euill to good from life to death and therefore sinne must depart and iustice come in the roome thereof that a darke house may be inlightned darkenes must first be abolished and light must come in the stead thereof and that a man may be iustified sinne must be couered and righteousnesse imputed the second question is how the son of god performed this obedience ans he was obedient to his father to the death and that according to all the duties of loue in the first table amp for the second table he loued his enemie as himselfe because he gaue his life for man marke then he did all things contained in the lawe and more too in respect of the duties of the second table for the lawe binds vs to loue our neighbours as our selues and not more then our selues this obedience therefore is truely to be tearmed a worke of supererogation and there is none in the world beside the vse that the son of god was conformable to the law it argues the goodnesse perfection and excellencie thereof here againe marke the difference between the man christ and all other man he was not borne subiect to the lawe but made subiect not subiect by nature but by will and by voluntarie abasement all other man are subiect not by will but by nature not made but borne subiect therefore paul saith the gentiles doe by nature the things of the lawe the remainders of the law since the fall are naturall in all man therfore the whole lawe was naturall before the fall man was at the first created in righteousnes and holinesse ephesians and therefore in a perfect subiection and conformitie to the lawe it is a naturall propertie of a reasonable creature to doe homage to the creator it is an error then in the papist to teach that the image of god in our first parents was supernaturall the fourth point or degree is the redemption of man fro vnder the law in these words that he might redeeme them which were vnder the law here fiue things are to be considered the first is what is meant by beeing vnder the law ans the lawe must be cosidered two waies first as the rule of life thus angels are vnder the lawe and adam before his fall and the saints nowe in heauen and none yeeld more subiection to the lawe then they and this subiection is their libertie againe the lawe must be considered as a grieuous yoke which none can beare it is a yoke three waies first because it did bind the church of the olde testament to the obseruation of many and that very costly ceremonies for the maintenance of the altar at hierusalem was a matter of great charges secondly it is a yoke because it binds euery offendour to euerlasting death gen gal thirdly it is a yoke as it increaseth sinne and as it is the strength of it corinthian rom and and it increaseth sinne not as a cause but as an occasion for the wicked nature of man is the more to doe a thing the more he is forbidden the israelites are bidden to goe on to canaan then they like egypt well they are forbidden to goe to canaan and comanded to stay in the wildernesse but then they will needs go to canaan circumcision commanded was lothed of all nation when it was abolished then man of sundrie nation imbraced it as needefull to saluation to be vnder the law then is to be in subiection to it as it is a burden and yoke in the three former respects specially to be subiect to the curse of the law the second point is who are vnder the law ans the iewes before the comming of christ were vnder the law in respect of ceremonies and all man naturally are vnder the law in respect of the malediction and curse therof all beeing borne children of wrath ephesians here comes a lamentable matter to be considered very few in respect know themselues to be in bondage to the curse of the law for they thinke it an easie matter to obserue the law and it is vsed for a forme of praier whereby man vse to blesse themselues morning and euening learne therefore this one lesson that thou article by nature in thy selfe vnder the curse of the law and for thine offences by it bound ouer to euerlasting death if thou should est be proclaimed an outlaw or a writ of rebellion should be serued on thee it would make thee at thy wits ende now behold the law proclaimes thee a traytour and rebell against god through heauen and earth the law shuts heauen against thee it sets hell and death wide open for thee and it armes all the creatures of god against thee therefore it stands thee in hand to looke about thee and to flie from the sentence of the lawe to the throne of grace for mercie and forgiuenes it hath bin the fashion of all holy man to acquaint themselues with this one lesson that they were by nature vnder the law specially then when they were to humble themselues in the presence of god daniel in his praier ascribes shame and confusion to himselfe daniel according to the voice and crie of the law and the prodigall son confesseth that he had sinned against his father and against heauen and that he was vnworthy to be accounted a child of god according to the law iudging and condemning himselfe the third point is what is the price wherby man are bought or redeemed from vnder the law ans the obedience of the son whereby he stood in subiection to the law for vs as paul signifies in the words immediatly going before it may be said how can the obedience of one man be a price of redemption for an other i answer we must consider christ not as a meere man but as god man and by this meanes his obedience is of infinit merit and efficacie againe we must consider him not as a priuate but as a publike person representing all the elect in his obedience to his father and by this meanes his obedience ferues for all that beleeue in him againe it may be alledged that the law saith thou shalt loue thou shalt not lust ampc and the soule that sinnes that soule shall die ezech and a man shall not redeeme the life of his brother psalm ans the law requires that euery man performe obedience and make satisfaction in his owne person and the law knows no other obedience but this must be considered that the law is but one part of the reuealed will of god and that the gospel is an other distinct part reuealing more then the law euer knew and the gospel teacheth a translation of the law in respect of obedience from our persons to the person of the mediatour and thereby it addes an exception to the law the fourth point is who are partakers of this redemption ans they which see and feele and bewaile their condition that they are vnder the law and flie from the sentence thereof to the throne of grace for mercie christ came to saue sinners matth that is such as are conuicted by the law and know themselues to be sinners he offers ease to them that trauell and are heauie laden matth he preacheth deliuerance to captiues luke here we are to bewaile the miserie of our people that know not themselues to be vnder the law nay they loue and delight to be vnder it for they alleadge for themselues that they say their praiers duly and truly that they meane well to god ward and deale truly with man and therfore they thinke god will haue mercy on them and haue them excused for all their offences the last point is what benefits arise of this deliuerance from vnder the law ans they which turne to god and beleeue in christ reape foure benefits hereby the first is that no sinne shall haue dominion ouer them rom here marke by the way that they which are in christ cannot wholly fall from grace for they which wholly fall away are vnder the dominion of sinne the second is that god will accept the indeauour to obay for obedience because they are freed from the rigour of the law read malac the third is that they haue libertie to liue and serue god without feare of damnation or any other euill luke the last is that afflictions cease to be curses and are turned to blessings and for this cause they are delaied and qualified for the good of them which are afflicted psalm j will correct them that offend with a rodde but i will not take my mercie from them prou grieue not for the correction of the lord for he loueth whome he correcteth ierem correct vs in iudgement and powre forth thy wrath vpon the nation that haue not knowne thee this must teach man that professe or teach christ not to be discouraged when they are abused railed on slaundered or cursed for if they be from vnder the law and so from vnder the sting of a guiltie conscience nothing shall hurt them they must be content for a while to suffer the snatches and bitings of the deuill for in the ende his head shall be bruised in peeces to ende this point it may be said if we that beleeue be not vnder the law then we may liue and die as we list ans we are free from the law as a yoke but not free from it as it is the rule of obedience and good life and because we are freed from the bondage of the law therefore we must be a law to our selues we must be voluntaries psalm without constraint freely yeelding subiection to the will of god and not for feare of hell and the last iudgement the third and last degree is the fruition of adoption in these words that we might receiue the adoption of sonnes here two questions are to be considered the first is how the church of the new testament is saide to receiue the adoption which was before receiued in the old testament ans in scripture a thing is often said to be done when it is done more fully and plentifully christ tells nathanael that he shall see heauen open ioh that is more plainly opened for it was not shut in the old testament and the holy ghost was not yet ioh that is in the full measure and the way into the holiest was not open while the tabernacle was standing hebr that is plainly made manifest and in this place beleeuers of the new testament receiue the adoption because they receiue it in a more full and plentifull manner in that the spirit of children is powred forth vpon them in larger measure whether we regard illumination or the gifts of regeneration this must teach vs that liue in these latter daies to put on the condition of sonnes and daughters of god in reuerence obedience and thankefulnes butalas among the multitude it is farre otherwise for the most liue euen as atheists in ignorance according to the lusts of their owne hearts the faith and repentance which they professe is but ceremoniall faith and repentance the second question is whence springs our adoption the answer is plaine in the words from the obedience of the son whereby he stood in subiection to the law here the question of all questions is answered namely what is that thing by which and for which a sinner is iustified before god and saued ans the obedience of the son of god made man and made vnder the law for vs for this is it that frees vs from vnder the law and giues vs the adoption of sonnes and this alone is it whereby we stand before the tribunall seat of god which also we are to oppose to the iudgement of god to hell death and condemnation therefore our common people erre that looke to be saued by their good deedes that is by their good meaning and dealing they thus tread the blood of christ vnder their owne feete and become iesuses or sauiours to themselues secondly they erre that teach iustification by the essentiall iustice of the godhead of the son for that it is incommunicable and they which are iustified by it are also deified thirdly the papist erreth which teacheth iustification partly by remission of sinnes and partly by that which we call inward sanctification which is imperfect and mixed in this life with our corruption and therefore vnfit to absolue and acquit vs before god it may be said what must we doe that we may be iustified and saued by this obedience of the mediatour answer in the old testament when a man had sinned he brought a sheepe or an oxe to the doore of the tabernacle and when the priest cut the throat of it the partie laid his hand vpon the head of it exod and hereby he signified that the beast had done no hurt and that he as a guiltie malefactour had deserued death now all this was done in figure and it teacheth vs that we miserable sinners must come to god that we must bring our sacrifice with vs namely the lambe of god which is the son of god made man amp made vnder the law that we must present this lambe and the oblation thereof to the father for vs laying our hands on the head of it that is confessing ourguiltinesse and that we haue iustly deserued death and perdition from the presence of god in the last place we must intreat the lord to accept the blood of the lamb for vs and the whole obedience of the mediatour thus shall we be iustified and saued thou wilt say i will therefore doe this when i am dying i say againe let it be thy daily exercise to the very death thou wast seauen yeares in learning of thy trade thinke not therfore in an houre or two to worke thy reconciliation with god if thou article many yeares in learning such things as are done by the strength of nature thinke not to attaine to things aboue nature when and howe thou wilt it is a rule receiued of all man that they must blesse themselues now the right way to blesse thy selfe is to plead guiltie before god and to intreat him to accept the obedience of the mediatour for thee uers sonnes that is such as inioy the libertie of sonnes sent forth a speach borrowed from embassadours which are sent forth with instructios what they shal say or do amp it signifies that the spirit reueales nothing but that which is the will of the father amp son ioh crying making vs to crie rom for if the words be taken properly the spirit must pray to it selfe abba the next word is the exposition father the sense the father hath sent forth the spirit of his son vnto you this spirit sent forth dwels in your hearts dwelling in your hearts it makes you pray to god as to a father and all this it doth because you are indeed sonnes of god the scope the question is whether beleeuers of the newe testament be servant to the law or children paul answers no and he giues two reasons the first was in the former verses the second in this and it is drawne from the signe thus yee haue receiued the spirit crying abba father therefore ye are sonnes indeede in the words i consider fiue things the person sent forth the spirit of the son the person sending god the manner of sending the place whither the spirit is sent your hearts the office of the spirit crying abba of the first the spirit of the son it is who is sent forth he is so called first because he proceeds by communication of substance or godhead not onely from the father but also from the son secondly because in his manhood he is annointed and filled with the holy ghost aboue measure thirdly because by his death he hath merited the giuing and sending of the holy ghost vnto vs moreouer the spirit of the son is here described first he is a person subsisting of himselfe in that he is said to be sent forth secondly he is a diuine person and no creature because he dwels in the hearts of all beleeuers thirdly he proceeds from the father and the son from the father because he is sent of him from the son because he is the spirit of the son the vse by this we learne that the intercession of christ is of force with god for he praied for the sending of the spirit and it is accomplished read ioh and it is a superfluous doctrine to teach the reall presence of the flesh of christ in the sacrament for christ is departed from vs in respect of his manhood because the spirit is sent ioh thirdly that which the spirit inwardly teacheth is the same with that which the son hath reuealed by the ministerie of the prophets and apostles because the spirit is the spirit of the son read ioh doctrines then concerning saluation that are beside or contrarie to the scriptures as a great part of the roman religion is are not reuealed by the spirit of god but are the fictions of the deuill the person sending is god that is the father in these words god sent forth the spirit of his son where marke the distinction of the persons in trinitie there is the father the son amp the spirit of the son and here remember that this action of sending forth argues not superioritie in the person sending nor inferioritie in the person sent for equals may send each other by common consent but it argues order and a distinction of persons in respect of their beginning for the father is of none the son is of the father and the holy ghost is of both and hence it is that he is sent of both the manner of this sending forth was on this sort we may not imagine that in this sending there was any change of place for the holy ghost is euery where but he is said to be sent forth when he manifests his presence by his diuine operation or by speciall amp supernaturall gifts in the hearts of beleeuers as by the gift of illumination faith regeneration life sense and motion are the gifts of the spirit and so are ciuill vertues but the sending of the spirit is onely in respect of such gifts as are bestowed in the church in the receiuing of which the spirit is acknowledged the place or mansion of the spirit is the heart that is the minde will and affection the heart is the very sinke of sinne yet that doth the spirit choose for his abode hence we learne that the beginning of our newe birth is in the heart when a newe light is put into the minde a newe and heauenly disposition into the will and affection the most principall part of our change or renouation is in the heart where the spirit abides the end of all teaching is loue out of a pure heart good conscience and faith vnfained tim the beginning and principall part of god worship is in the heart he that serues god in the righteonsnesse of his heart in peace and ioy in the holy ghost is accepted rom in our hearts no wicked or carnall thought will desire or lust must raigne but onely god word and spirit for thy heart is the house where the spirit dwels and he must be lord of his owne house aboue all things keepe watch and warde about thy heart and fill it with all good cogitations amp desires that it may be a fit place of intertainment for the spirit who is as it were an embassadour sent from the great god vnto thee the last thing is the office of the spirit which is to make beleeuers crie abba here i consider things the meanes whereby this crie is caused the nature of it to whome it is directed the manner of direction for the first in the effecting or causing of this crie there are workes of the spirit the first is conuiction when a man in his iudgement and conscience is conuicted that the scriptures of the prophets and apostles are indeed the word of god to this purpose there are many arguments which nowe i omit this conuiction is a common worke of the spirit yet necessarie because much atheisme lies lurking in our hearts which makes vs call into question euery part of the word of god the second worke is subiection whereby a man conuicted that the scripture and euery part of it is the word of god subiects himselfe in his heart to the commandement of god which bids him turne to god and beleeue in christ and this second is a worke of the spirit of grace proper to the elect the third is the certificate or testimonie of the spirit which is a diuine manner of reasoning framed in the mindes of them that beleeue and repent on this manner he that beleeues and repents is god child thus saith the gospel but i beleeue in christ and repent at the least i subiect my will to the commandement which biddes me repent and beleeue i detest mine vnbeleefe and all my sinnes and desire the lord to increase my faith therefore i am the child of god he that beleeues and repents is god child thus saith the gospel but i beleeue in christ and repent at the least i subiect my will to the commandement which biddes me repent and beleeue i detest mine vnbeleefe and all my sinnes and desire the lord to increase my faith therefore i am the child of god this is the practicall syllogisme of the h ghost it is the testimonie of the spirit that we are the sonnes of god it is the earnest of the spirit and the seale whereby we are sealed to the day of our redemption and it containes the certentie ofspeciall faith the fourth thing that followes vpon this testimonie is peace of conscience ioy and affiance in god and from this affiance comes the crying here mentioned whereby euery true beleeuer with open throat as it were cries vnto god the father this doctrine is of great worth it is the hinge vpon which the gate of heauen turnes and therefore to be remembred the vse by this we see a manifest errour in the popish religion which teacheth that we can haue no other certenty of our saluation in this life but that which is probable or coniecturall that is a certentie ioyned with feare suspicion and some doubting certentie in respect of god that promiseth feare amp doubting in respect of our owne indisposition but this doctrine is false for they which are god children receiue the spirit crying abba and this crying argues affiance or confidence in god by faith we haue confidence in god and entrance with boldnesse ephesians and boldnesse is opposite to feare and excludes doubting in respect of our selues againe by this doctrine we see it is ordinarie and possible for all that beleeue and repent to be certainly assured that they are the children of god for if they haue the spirit of god crying in them as all god childre haue they cannot but perceiue this crie and withall they haue the testimonie of the spirit in them which is the ground of this crie rom and seeing this is so we must be admonished to vse all meanes that we may be assured that we are the children of god pet giue all diligence to make your election sure paul bids rich man lay vp a good foundation against the time to come tim and this foundation must be laide not in heauen but in the conscience god of his mercie hath made a couenant or bargaine with vs that beleeue and repent in this bargaine he hath promised to vs pardon of our sinnes and life euerlasting let vs then neuer be at rest till we haue receiued earnest from the hand of god and haue his promise sealed vnto vs by the spirit in our hearts you will say what shall i doe to be assured that i am god child ans thou must examine thy selfe of two things the first is whether thou article conuicted in thy iudgement that the scripture is indeede the word of god if thou article not yet conuicted then inquire and vse meanes that thou maist indeed be conuicted otherwise all is in vaine secondly inquire whether thou dost indeed and in good earnest submit and subiect thy will to the comandement of god which bids thee beleeue in christ and turne vnto god for if thou canst say that thou dost will to beleeue and will to repent if thou shew this will indeede in the vse of good meanes if thou condemne and detest thy vnbeleefe and all other thy sinnes thou hast receiued the earnest of the spirit and thou article indeede the child of god and this assurance shall be vnto thee of great vse for it will make thee reioyce in afflictions and it will worke patience experience hope rom it will make thee despise this world it will take away the feare of death and kindle in thy heart a desire to be with christ touching the nature of this crie it stands in the desires and groanes of the heart directed vnto god and these desires may be distinguished from all carnall desires by three properties first of all they are in the hearts of them that are turned to god or at the least beginne to turne vnto him for god heareth no sinners secondly they are conceiued in the minde according to the reuealed will of god rom ioh thirdly they are diuine and spirituall touching things which concerne the kingdome of god rom desires thus qualified haue the force of a loud crie in the eares of god psalm god heareth the desire of the poore psalm all my desires are before thee psalm he fulfilleth the desire of them that feare of him isa before they crie i will answer that is so soone as a desire of my helpe is conceiued and before it be vttered i will answer that the desires of our hearts are cries it is by meanes of the intercession of christ this intercession is not a vocall but a vertuall praier in that the son of god presents his manhood and his merits before the father in heauen willing as god and desiring as man that the father should accept the said merits for vs now this will and desire of the son is of great force with the father it is a crie in which the father is well pleased and by it the desires of our hearts are cries in the eares of god of these desires there be two speciall examples in the scriptures the first is when we are touched in our hearts for our sinnes to flie to the throne of grace and to desire reconciliation with god in christ when dauid did but desire the pardon of his sinnes and therefore purposed in his heart to humble himselfe he receiued pardon psalm i said i will confesse my wickednes against my selfe vnto the lord and thou forgauest the punishment of my sinne when the prodigall son conceiued a desire to be reconciled to his father with a purpose to confesse his offence before he had vttered his desire he is receiued to mercie luke the second example is a desire of god presence and protection in common iudgements when moses stoode at the redde sea in great danger hauing the sea before him and pharaohs charriots behind him no doubt he lifted vp his heart vnto god but we read not of any thing that he said and yet the lord saith why criest thou to me exod when iehosaphat was in great distresse by reason of the armie of the ammonites confounded in himselfe he saith o lord we know not what to doe but our eyes are towards thee chronicle and hereupon he obtained deliuerance the vse by this we learne to lay aside formall praying and lippe labour and to learne to lift vp our hearts to god in heauenly sighs and desires for that is indeede to pray it is the very first thing that the child of god doth inwardly to sigh and desire reconciliation with god in christ and he which cannot doe this is not as yet borne of god againe many are cast downe in themselues because they see their mindes full of ignorance their wills full of rebellion and subiect to many temptations and they find little goodnes in themselues but they must be comforted by this if they can but groane and sigh vnto god in their hearts for mercie and forgiuenes they haue the spirit of god crying in them abba and they haue receiued the first fruits of the spirit the desires and cries of our hearts are fruits of the intercession or crie of the son of god in heauen for vs others are grieued because they haue praied long and they find not the fruit of their praiers but if they can pray sighing and groaning in their hearts for grace and mercie let them be content for it is the spirit of grace and praier that makes them sigh and groane and euery sigh of a contrite heart hath a loud crie in the eares of god it falls out often that man in extremitie of danger confounded in themselues know not what in the world to say or doe ezechias in his sicknes could not say any thing but chatter in his throat and mourne like a doue isa some lie vnder the sword of the enemie others in a tempest are cast ouer shipboard into the sea now this must be their comfort if they can lift vp their hearts vnto god if they can but sigh amp groane for his presence and assistance the lord will heare the petitions of their hearts for the inward sobbes groanes and sighs of repentant sinners are loud and strong cries in the eares of god the father the third point is that the crie of the spirit is directed to god because it makes vs crie abba father here first obserue that praier to saints and angels is carnall praier for the praier which is caused by the spirit is direct to the father and good reason for it is the propertie of god to heare the crie of the heart rom some say that the saints in heauen are with god and that in him they see the desires of our hearts but it is false which they say for the scripture saith that god alone searcheth the heart king none knowes what is in man but god and the spirit of man corinthian though abraham had the sight of god yet is it said thou article our father and abraham knowes vs not isa and for this cause inuocation of saints whether it be called latria or dulia is flat idolatry againe praier is to be made to god as he hath reuealed himselfe in the word that is to god who is the father of christ and in him our father who also sends his spirit into our hearts crying abba it is an heathenish practise which is also the practise of many among vs to pray to an absolute god that is to god out of the father son and holy spirit thirdly here we see that true and spirituall inuocation of god is a marke of the church of god because it is a fruit of the spirit of god in them that are the children of god and by this the people of god are noted act corinthian and on the contrarie it is the marke of an atheist not to pray psalm the last point is the manner of directing our cries to god first of all they are to be directed to him with reuerence as beeing present with vs for to crie abba is not to speake words into the aire but to direct our hearts to one that is present with vs in all dutifull and childlike manner thus did dauid psalm and paul ephesians secondly our cries are to be directed to god with subiection to his will read the example of christ mark and of dauid sam this condemnes the practise of many man balaam desired to die the death of the righteous but without subiection to god for he would not liue the life of the righteous and many among vs haue often good motions and desires in their minds but there is no soundnes in them because they are not ioyned with a change and conuersion of heart and life thirdly our desires are to be directed vnto god with importunitie and instancie for the spirit makes vs crie abba father that is my father and thy father god requires this importunitie of vs luke it is practised by dauid psalm by the woman of canaan matth we must doe as iacob did wrastle with god and giue him no rest till he fulfil the desires of our hearts and giue vs the blessing and our constant desires and groanes to heauen for mercie shall neuer be in vaine for if we aske any thing according to his will he heareth vs indeede ioh verse these words are the conclusion of the former doctrine of paul the time of our libertie is come in that your libertie is procured and purchased by christ and ye haue receiued the spirit of sonnes crying abba therefore ye are not servant to the lawe but sonnes of god and from this conclusion paul deriues a second which is the summe and substance of the whole disputation from the beginning of the third chapter to this place namely that they which are sonnes are also heires not by the lawe and the works thereof but by christ this verse is a repetition of the amp verses of the third chapter therfore i will not stand any loger in the hadling of it one thing is to be obserued namely the change of the number paul said before ye are sonnes here he saith thou article a son and this he doth to teach vs that they which turne to god amp beleeue in christ must be assured that they are the sonnes and heires of god paul hath set downe immediately before the infallible signe whereby a man may knowe himselfe to be the childe of god therefore in the next words he saith therefore thou article the son of god saint john saith these things we write vnto you that beleeue that ye may know that ye haue life euer lasting ioh thus must euery beleeuer apply the gospell and the benefits thereof to himselfe the meditation of this point serues greatly to sweeten all crosses vnto vs for if we know that we be god children that is comfort enough and we may then assure our selues that in euery crosse god comes vnto vs as a father again this meditation works a contentation in euery losse for if thou be the childe of god thou canst haue no great losse for all things are thine thou christs and christ god corinthian lastly this meditation must stirre vp in vs a care to lead a heauenly and spirituall life ioh that we may be like our eldest brother christ iesus v but euen then when yee knew not god ye did seruice vnto them which by nature are not god v but nowe seeing ye know god or rather are known of god how turne ye againe vnto impotent and beggarly rudiments whereunto as from the beginning ye will be in bondage againe v yee obserue daies and moneths and times and yeares v i am in feare of you least i haue bestowed labour on you in vaine here paul returnes againe to the principall conclusion of the whole epistle which is on this manner if i paul be called to teach and my doctrine be true ye haue done euill to reuolt from it to another gospel but i am called to teach and my doctrine is true this paul prooued in the first second and third chapters therefore ye haue done euill to reuolt from my doctrine this conclusion he propounded before and here againe he repeates it and withall amplifies it two waies first by setting downe the particular matter of the reuolt and apostacie of the galatians v ye returne to impotent rudiments ye obserue daies and times secondly he sets downe the greatnesse of their reuolt first by comparison thus once ye serued false god but there is some excuse of that offence because ye did not know god but that ye haue returned to the rudiments of the world there is no excuse of it for ye then knewe god or rather were known of god againe he sets forth the greatnesse of their reuolt by the effect v it makes me feare least i haue lost my labour among you here paul sets downe a threefold estate of the galatians their estate in gentilisme before their conuersion their estate in their conuersion and their estate in the apostasie their estate in gentilisme stands in two things ignorance of god then ye knew not god idolatry or superstition ye serued them which are not god by nature touching their ignorance of god it may be demaunded how they can be said not to know god whereas paul saith that which may be known of god is made manifest vnto the gentiles rom and that god did not leaue himselfe without witnesse act answer knowledge of god is twofold naturall or reuealed knowledge naturall is that which all man haue in their minds by the light of nature which also they may gather by the view and obseruation of the creatures this knowledge hath two properties the first it is imperfect because by it we know some fewe and generall things of god as namely that there is a god and that he is to be worshipped ampc in this respect this knowledge is like the ruines of a princely pallace againe it is weake because it serues onely to cut off excuse and it is not sufficient to direct vs in the worship of god nay when by it we beginne to set downe the worship of god we then runne headlong into superstition and vanitie reuealed knowledge is that which is set downe in the written word whereby we may knowe what god is in himselfe and what he is to vs namely a father in christ giuing pardon of sinne and life euerlasting this knowledge the gentiles altogether want nay by reason of the blindenes and impotencie of their minds they iudge it foolishnesse thus then in effect though the gentiles by nature know some things of god yet doe they not knowe god as he will be known of vs againe it may be demaunded whether this ignorance be a sinne in the galatians answer yes for all man are bound to know god by the first commandement and this ignorance is a want of the image of god in the minde column and euery defect of the image of god is a branch of originali sinne and vengeance is the punishment of this sinne thess it may be obiected that paul here excuseth the galatians by their ignorance answer it excuseth tanto non toto that is the degree and measure of the sinne and not the sinne it selfe luke againe it may be said that this their ignorance is inuincible because as the gentiles doe not know god so they cannot know him ans that they cannot know him it is not god fault but the fault of their first parents and consequently their fault and this ignorance spreads it selfe ouer all mankinde as a punishment of the first offence the third point is that this ignorance is a great and grieuous sinne for here paul makes it the mother of superstition and idolatry this must teach vs all to detest this ignorance of god and his will and to seeke by all meanes to knowe god god hath a controuersie with man because they knowe him not hose againe this serues to warne all ministers of the word to be carefull to roote out ignorance out of the minds of the people and to plant the knowledge of god and by this we see it is false which the papist teacheth that ignorance is the mother of deuotion the second sinne of the galatians is that they serued them which are not god by nature that is false god not god indeede but god in opinion it may be obiected that the wisest of the gentiles worshipped the true god creator of heauen and earth answer false god are set vp two waies the first is when that which is not god is placed and worshipped in the roome of the true god as when the son moone and starres are worshipped ampc and this is the grossest kind of idolatry the second is when man acknowledge the true god but doe not conceiue him as he will be conceiued amp as he hath reuealed himselfe in the word in this respect the ephesians are said to be without god ephesians and the samaritanes to worship they knew not what ioh for they conceiued the true god in a false manner because they conceiued him forth of the father son and holy ghost and therefore they set vp a false god vnto themselues false worship giuen to god presupposeth a false opinion of god and a false opinion of god sets vp an idol or false god in the roome of the true god for it is not sufficient to conceiue some true things of god but we must precisely conceiue him as he hath reuealed himselfe without addition or detraction and thus did the wisest of the galatians worshippe false god this idolatry is a common sinne and bred as it were in the bone the turkes at this daie worshippe a false and fained god for they conceiue and worship a god creatour of heauen and earth that is neither father son nor holy ghost and the iewes worship god out of christ and so a fained god for he which hath not the son hath not the father ioh likewise the religion of the papist teacheth and maintaineth the worship of false god for it giues to angels and saints a facultie or power to know the desires of our hearts to heare and helpe vs in all places at all times and hereupon praier is made to them but all this is indeede the prerogatiue and priuiledge of the true god and in as much as it is giuen to angels and saints departed they are set vp in the roome of the true god againe that religion teacheth man to worship god in at and before images and this worship presupposeth an opinion or imagination that there is a god that will be present to heare and helpe vs in at and before images now this god is a god deuised by the braine of man papists alleadge that their intention is to worship the true god the father son and holy ghost and i say againe that the true god hath reuealed his will that he doth detest this manner of worship and therefore the worship is directed either to the images themselues or to the god deuised in the braine thirdly they of the popish religion worship a fained christ of their owne deuising namely a christ that sits at the right hand of the father in heauen and is withall in the hands of euery priest after the words of consecration and they worship a god set vp by themselues namely a god that will be appeased by humane satisfactions and at whose hands a sinnefull man may merit euerlasting life that is to say a god all of mercie and little or no iustice though our religion teach no idolatry yet certen it is that many among vs practise a spirituall idolatry in their hearts for looke what a man loues most and cares most for and delites most in that is his god some therefore haue their riches for their god some their pleasures some their beastly lusts for where the heart is there is thy god againe the ignorant multitude worship a god of their owne coyning which is a god made all of mercie and no iustice for they perswade themselues that there is mercie with god though they repent not but goe on in their sinnes whereas the true god is infinite not onely in mercie but also in iustice exod that this sinne of idolatry may be rooted out of the minds of man there must be first an illumination of the minde with the knowledge of the true god and his will and there must also be a renouation of the heart and affections that they set not vp something els in the roome of god the estate of the galatians after their conuersion is in these words ye knowe god or rather are known of god the knowledge whereby man know god is either litterall knowledge or spirituall knowledge litterall is when the doctrine of god and his will is known without reformation of life spirituall knowledge is when the minde is inlightened by the spirit of god with the knowledge of god by the word and according to the word so as thereupon man are transformed into the image of god corinthian and this kind of knowledge is here meant when paul saith ye know god the foundation of this knowledgae is that god is to be knowne in christ for in him god hath manifested his infinite wisdome iustice mercie therefore is he called the ingranen image of the person of the father heb and paul saith that we haue the knowledge of the glorie of god in the face of iesus christ corinthian the properties of this knowledge are three the first is that it must be a speciall knowledge whereby we must acknowledge god to be our god in christ the first commandement of the law requires that we take the true god for our god the commandement of christ is beleeue the gospel now the stipulation of the couenant of grace which also is the substace of the gospel is this i am thy god ier this therefore must we beleeue and to this knowledge is the promise of life euer lasting annexed ioh isa the second propertie is that this knowledge must not be confused but distinct first we must acknowledge the true god in respect of his presence with vs in all places thus moses is saide to know the inuisible hebr secondly we must know and acknowledge god in respect of his particular prouidence ouer vs thus dauid knew god when he saide that he numbred his flittings and put his teares into his bottle psalm thirdly we must know god in respect of his will in all things to be done and to be suffered and this is the right knowledge of god to haue regard to his will rom ephesians dauid saith all thy lawes are before me sam and when shemei reuiled he spake thus he raileth because god biddes him raile sam lastly we must know and acknowledge god in the power which he shewed in the death and resurrection of christ read and consider ephesians where paul placeth the knowledge of god in two things in the knowledge of the riches of eternall life and in an experimentall knowledge of the vertue of the resurrection of christ in our selues the third propertie is that this knowledge must be an effectuall and liuely knowledge working in vs new affections and inclinations he that saith he knowes god and keepes not his commandements makes him a liar ioh and tit last the vse seeing the conuersion of a sinner stands in this spirituall knowledge of god we must be stirred vp to seeke to know god according as he will be knowne of vs we desire to serue god and we cannot serue him vnlesse we know him nay so long as we know him not we doe nothing but serue the false god of our owne hearts againe we desire life eternall and this is life in right manner to acknowledge god ioh and the whol matter of our boasting must be the knowledge of god ierem god himselfe ministreth vnto me a further argument to mooue you to this desire namely by the moouing of the earth yesterday for though philosophers ascribe all to nature yet the truth is that the trembling and shogging of the earth is a signe of the great and extraordinarie anger of god the cause of this anger is that we know not god neither doe we for the most part care to know him we haue had the gospel long but we bring forth but small fruits for this cause the earth in his trembling doth as it were groane to be disburdened of so rebellious a nation and it doth aster a sort craue leaue of god that it may deuoure a sinnefull people as it once deuoured datha and the company of abiram now our dutie is in this iudgement of god to acknowledge his maiestie his anger and his iustice and with feare and trembling to humble our selues for our sinnes past thereby to preuent his anger to come the earth a bruite and dumme creature in his kinde is become a preacher vnto vs and his trembling must teach vs to tremble in our hearts and to sinne no more againe if we must know god we must remember god and christ and as we must know god so must we remember him now we must not knowe christ according to the flesh corinthian and therefore we may not remember christ according to the flesh that is in any worldly and carnall manner this therefore is not to keepe a memorie of christ to spend twelue daies in reuell and riot in masking and mumming in carding and dicing as many doe this is rather to burie the memorie of christ and to doe homage to the god of pleasure of them that saide let vs eate drinke and sleepe paul faith thus awake and doe righteously for some of you doe not know god corinthian paul saith further but rather ye are knowne of god the knowledge whereby god knowes man stands in two things his election of them to his speciall loue tim and the execution of election whereby he makes man his peculiar people by calling iustifying and sanctifying of them tit v hence obserue first that god election is the roote of all the gifts of god in vs we know god because he first knows vs paul saith that we were elected that we might be holy ephesians therefore we are not elected as some teach either for our faith or according to our faith but to our faith that is elected that we might beleeue secondly hence we learne that we can neither thinke will or doe that which is good vnlesse god preuent vs with his grace god must first vouchsafe to acknowledge vs before we can acknowledge him ioh preuenting grace is twofold the first and the second the first when god in our first conuersion takes away the stonie heart and puts a fleshie heart in the roome the second is after we are regenerate for then god still preuents vs with good motions and desires of both read ezech some teach that if we doe that which we can god will giue vs his grace but this is false for then we should preuent god thirdly by this we see that the workes of grace in god imprint their image in the hearts of them that belong to god and this is worth the marking there is a knowledge in god whereby he knowes who are his and this knowledge brings forth an other knowledge in vs whereby we know god for our god there is an election in god which workes in the elect an other election whereby they choose god for their god the loue whereby god loues vs workes in vs an other loue whereby we loue god ioh christ first apprehends vs and this apprehension of his workes in vs the apprehension of faith wherby we lay hold vpon him philipp when christ makes intercession for vs in heauen there is another intercession wrought in our hearts by the spirit whereby we crie abbafather rom the death of christ hath a vertue in it to worke in vs the death of sinne thus doth the spirit of god seale vs to the day of our redemption by this may we know that we belong to god if we finde any impression of the grace of god in vs the sun by his light shines vpon vs and by the same light we view and behold the sun lastly here is the foundation of true comfort our faith doth not saue vs because it is a perfect vertue but because it apprehends a perfect obiect namely the perfect obedience of christ so then if our faith erre not in his obiect but be rightly fixed on the true causes of our saluation though it be but a weake faith and doe no more but cause vs to will desire and indeauour to apprehend christ it is true faith and iustifieth the weakenesse of it shall not hinder our saluation which stads not in this that we knowe god but in this that god knowes vs whose knowledge is perfect and cannot faile againe our saluation stands not in our apprehension of christ but in christs apprehending of vs philipp this knowledge of god whereby he knowes vs hath two properties first it is speciall whereby he knowes all the elect euen by name exod againe it is a perpetuall and vnchangeable knowledge for whome god once knowes he neuer forgets isai the third estate of the galatians is their estate in their reuolt or apostasie in these words how turne ye again to impotent and beggarly rudiments whereunto as from the beginning ye will be in bondage againe or thus to which ye will doe seruice againe as from the beginning the words carrie this sense how turne ye againe that is it is an intollerable offence in you hauing knowne god to returne againe to the rudiments of the law by rudiments we are to vnderstand circumcision the iewish sacrifices and all the ceremonies of the law of moses and it may not seeme strange that they are called impotent and beggarly rudiments for they must be considered three waies with christ without christ and against christ with christ when they are considered as types and figures of christ to come and as signes of grace by diuine institution for the time of the old testament without christ when they are vsed onely for custome whether before or after the death of christ against christ when they are esteemed as meritorious causes of saluation and the iustification of a sinner is placed in them either in whole or in part as though christ alone were not sufficient in this respect paul calls them impotent and beggarly rudiments and paul hauing said that the galatians returned againe to the rudiments of the lawe in the next words he shewes howe they doe it namely by seruing them againe they serued or yeilded seruice to them three waies in opinion because they iudged them to be necessarie parts of god worshippe and means of their saluation in conscience because they subiected their consciences to them in affection because they placed part of their affiance in them for their iustification and saluation it may be demanded howe the galatians can be said to returne againe to the rudiments of the law amp serue them againe that were neuer vsed to them before answer in the speach of paul there is that which is called catachresis that is a kind of speaking somewhat improper in respect of finenesse and elegancie the like we haue ruth when ruth is said to returne to iuda with naomi amp yet shee was neuer there before neuerthelesse the speach in sense is most significant and proper for paul no doubt signifies hereby that when the galatians subiected themselues to the rudiments of the law and placed their saluation in part euen in them they did in effect and in trueth as much as returne againe to their old superstitions amp serue againe their false god here then we haue a description of the apostasie of the galatians it is a voluntarie sinne for paul saith ye will serue after the knowledge of the truth in which they returne againe to the rudiments of the law by yeelding subiection and seruice to them which act of theirs is indeede as much as if they had serued againe their false god here some may say if this be so then they sinned against the holy ghost ans the sinne against the holy ghost is indeede a voluntarie sinne but that is by reason of the obstinacie and malice of the will and this offence in the galatians was voluntate onely by infirmitie againe the sinne against the holy ghost is an vniuersall apostasie in respect of all the articles of religion for that sinne makes man crucifie christ crucified heb and to tread vnder foote the son of god the apostasie of the galatians was particular onely in the article of iustification the vse in that the ceremonies of the law set vp against christ in the cause of our iustification and saluation are called impotent and beggarly rudiments paul teacheth a waightie conclusion that christ stands alone in the worke of redemption without collegue or partner without deputy or substitute whether we respect the whole worke of redemption or the least part of it againe that all the workes of mediation stand alone by themselues and admit nothing to be added and adioyned to them there is no other name whereby we can be saued beside the name of christ act christ saues them perfectly that come vnto him heb in him we are complete column he alone treads the winepresse of god wrath and none with him isai if christ be a sauiour he must be a perfect sauiour considering he is god and man and beeing a perfect sauiour in himselfe he needs no partner and because he is euery where all times therefore he needs no deputy in his stead again euery worke of redemption is acted by whole christ according to both his natures and as there are in him two natures so are there two operations of the said natures and as both natures concurre to make one person so the operatios of both natures concurre to make the compound worke of a mediatour which is an admirable worke not meerely humane but theandricke that is humane diuine for this cause no action pertaining to redemptio can be performed by a mere creature whether man or angel obiection i ioh the apostles haue the power to remit and retaine sinnes therefore it is not proper to christ answer to remit by meriting and by efficacie in the conferring of pardon is proper to the mediatour the apostles and other ministers remit by preaching and by declaring remision the ministers of the word doe not procure our reconciliation with god as christ doth but they exhort man to be reconciled to god corinthian obiect ii pet baptisme saueth therefore not christ alone ans baptisme saueth by signifying and by sealing vnto vs the grace and mercie of god and the effecting of our saluation is in the same place ascribed to christ and his resurrection the conclusion then of paul is to be remebred for it serues as in engyne to ouerturne the maine grounds of popery the primacie of the pope is a certen estate in which he is substituted into the place and roome of christ for he takes vpon him to make lawes that properly and truely binde conscience euen as the lawes of god againe he takes vnto him a proper and iudiciall power to remit or retaine the sinnes of man nowe these actions indeed are the proper actions of god amp christ no meere creature is capable of them in this respect the primacie of the pope is an impotent and beggarly inuention again the roman relligion beside the al sufficient oblation of christ vpon the crosse lets vp the sacrifice of the masse for the sinnes of the quicke and the dead besides the intercession of christ it sets vp the intercession of saints and angels beside the perfect satisfaction of christ it sets vp humane satisfactions beside the infinite merit of christ it maintaines and magnifies the merit of humane workes but all these are but impotent and beggarly deuises of man for christ in his sacrifice satisfaction intercession merit admits no corriuall or associate all actions of his are perfect in their kind and neede no supplie this againe must teach vs to content our selues with christ alone and not to set vp any thing with him or against him this is the safest and the surest course a certen papist writeth to this effect that we protestant in our iustification cleaue only to the bodie of the tree and that the papists cleaue both to the bodie and the branches and i say againe it is the safest with both the hands to cleaue to the bodie of the tree and he that with one hand laies hold vpon the bodie of the tree and with the other staies himselfe vpon the branches in great danger of falling the second conclusion of paul is that to set vp any thing out of christ as a meritorious cause of saluation and to place our iustification in it either in whole or in part is indeede the seruice of idols and the reason is plaine for this is to set vp something in the place and roome of christ and man put a confidence in that which they make a cause of their owne saluation the doctrine then of iustification by works is a doctrine that maintaines idolatry for if they iustifie we may put our trust in them and if we put our confidence in them we make idols of them that works may merit at god hand they must not onely be sanctified but also deified the distinction vsed of the papists of latria and dulia that is of worship and seruice falls to the ground they say they giue worship to god and seruice to angels and saints it is a toie for here paul condemnes the very seruice to heathen god and the seruice of the rudiments of the law is the apostasie of the galatians and to giue seruice or worshippe to any thing are all one the third conclusion of paul is that they which haue giuen their names to god and christ must not returne to any thing that they haue forsaken or ought to forsake he that puts his hand to the plough must not looke backe he that goes to the land of canaan must not looke backe to egypt we in england haue bin long deliuered from the superstition of popery and we must not so much as dreame of any returne it is a common fault among vs that in outward profession we cleaue to christ amp yet in affection and practise we cleaue to the world and walke after the lusts of our owne hearts this is in shew to goe forward but in deede to turne backe againe but our dutie is in thought conscience will affection word and deede to go on forward and no way to goe backe verse in the former verse paul sets downe the apostasie of the galatians in generall tearmes saying how turne ye againe to the elements of the world in the verse he shewes what these elements be ye obserued daies and moneths and times and yeares by daies are meant iewish sabbaths by moneths the feasts obserued euery moneth in the day of the new moone by times some vnderstand the feast of the passeouer the feast of pentecost and the feast of tabernacies but the word signifies seasons or fit times for the doing of this or that busines so is it translated act it is not for you to know the times and seasons it was the manner of the gentiles to make difference of times in respect of good or bad successe and that according to the signes of heauen and it is very likely that the galatians obserued daies not onely in the iewish but also in the heathenish manner by yeares are meant euery seuenth yeare and the iubelie yeares which the galatians obserued after the fashion of the iewes againe there is a fourefold kind of obseruation of daies one naturall the other ciuill the third ecclesiasticall the fourth superstitious naturall is when daies are obserued according to the course of the sun amp moone gen thus day follows night and night followes day and euery yeare hath foure seasons spring sommer autumne winter and the obseruation of these times is according to the law of nature ciuill obseruation is when set times are obserued for husbandrie in plant setting reaping sowing for houshold affaires and for the affaires of the commonwealth in keeping of faires and markets ampc and thus to obserue daies is not unlawful ecclesiasticall obseruation of times is when set daies are obserued for orders sake that man may come together to worship god these daies are either daies of thanksgiuing or daies of humiliation of daies of thanksgiuing take the example of the iewes hest who obserued yearely the feast of purim for a memorie of their deliuerance in like manner they appointed and obserued the feast of dedication and it seemes that christ was present at ierusalem as an obseruer of this feast ioh and thus for orders sake to obserue certaine daies of solemnitie is not forbidden superstitious obseruation of daies is twofold iewish or heathenish iewish when set daies are obserued with an opinion that we are bound in conscience to obserue them and when the worship of god is placed in the obseruing of this or that time heathenish when daies are obserued in respect of good or bad successe now then to come to the point the intent of paul is onely to condemne the iewish manner of obseruing of daies in these words ye obserue daies moneths yeares and the heathenish manner in these words ye obserue seasons against this interpretation the place of paul may be obiected rom he that obserues the day obserues it to the lord ans indeede paul in these words excuseth the romanes that obserued daies and saith that their intention was to obserue them to the honour of god and this he saith because as yet they were not fully instructed touching christian libertie but withall let it be remembred that in mild sort he notes this to be a fault in them when he saith that they were weake in faith now the case was otherwise with the galatians because they obserued daies after they had bin informed touching their libertie in christ and withall they placed their saluation in part in the obseruation of daies and thus they mixed the gospel with the law and therefore they were iustly to be blamed againe it may be obiected that now in the time of the new testament we in religious manner obserue the lord day ans some man both godly and learned are of opinion that the lord day was appointed by the apostles for orders sake and that it is in the libertie of the church to appoint the sabbath vpon any other day in the weeke because they say all daies without exception are equall and they adde further that when the publike worship of god is ended man may then returne to their labours or giue themselues to recreation on the lord day but this doctrine seemes not to stand with the fourth commandement it seemes to be a truth more probable that euery seauenth day in the weeke must be set a part in holy rest vnto god for this is the substance of the fourth commandement and it is also very probable that the sabbath of the new testament is limited and determined by our sauiour christ to the lord day for paul and the rest of the apostles obserued the first day of the weeke for a sabbath day act and he saith whatsoeuer ye haue heard and what ye haue seene in me that doe philipp againe it was the decree or constitution of paul that the collection for the poore should be the first day of the weeke at corinthian now this collection in the primitiue church followed preaching praier sacraments and it was the conclusion of all other exercises in the assemblie corinthian and this first day of the weeke is called the lord day apocrypha and it is so called because it was dedicated and consecrated to the honour of christ our lord and who is the author of this dedication but christ himselfe the lord of the sabboth it is alleadged that the sabbath and the commandement touching the sabbath is ceremoniall and vpon this ground they take libertie amp keep no sabbath at all but the truth is that the commandement touching the sabbath is not wholly ceremoniall it may be the first words remember the sabbath day to sanctifie it and the words in it thou shalt doe no manner of worke ampc are spoken of the iewes sabbath but the wordes sixe daies shalt thou labour and the seuenth day is the sabbath of the lord thy god are morall and containe a perpetuall truth therefore the words of paul must be conceiued with an exception of the sabbath day which is the seuenth day in euery weeke which day christ hath limited by his apostles to the lord day the vse this text of paul discouers vnto vs a great part of the superstition of the popish church in the obseruation of holy daies first beside the lord day they appoint many other sabbaths whereas it is the priuiledge of god to appoint an ordinarie day of rest and to sanctifie it to his owne honour secondly they bind mens consciences to the obseruation of their holy daies which paul here forbids and column thirdly they place the worship of god in the obseruation of their holy daies but god is worshipped in vaine by mens precepts matth fourthly they place a great holines in their festiuall daies more then in other daies fiftly they dedicate many of their holy daies to the honour of saints and angels whereas the dedication of ordinarie and set daies is a part of diuine or religious worship lastly their holy daies for number are more then the festiuall daies of the iewes and thus they bring people into their old bondage nay to a greater bondage then euer the iewes indured in respect of daies and times it may be said that the church of the protestant obserue holy daies ans some churches doe not because the church in the apostles daies had no holy day beside the lord day and the commandement inioynes the labour of sixe daies indeede the churches of england obserueth holy daies but the popish superstition is cut off for we are not bound in conscience to the obseruation of these daies neither doe we place holines or the worship of god in them but we keepe them onely for orders sake that man may come to the church to heare god word and though we retaine the names of saints daies yet we giue no worship to saints but to god alone and such daies as contained nothing in them but superstition as the conception and assumption of the virgin marie we haue cut off thus doth the church with vs obserue holy daies and no otherwise indeede the ignorant multitude among vs faile greatly in the obseruing of daies for they greatly solemnise the time of the birth of christ and then they keepe few or no markets but the lord day is not accordingly respected and man will not be disswaded from following of faires on that day againe to obserue daies of good amp bad successe according to the constellations of the heauens is an heathenish fashion to be auoided for it is here condemned in the galatians here therefore we must be put in minde not to obserue the planetarie houres for man suppose that the houres of the daie are ruled by the planets and hereupon that some houres are good and luckie as they say and some vnluckie that man are taken with planets and borne vnder vnluckie planets but these are heathenish conceits neither must we respect our horoscope or the time of our birth and the constellation of the heauens the as though we could hereby know what should befall vs to the end of our daies and we must not put difference of daies as though some were luckie vnto vs and some vnluckie according to the course of the starres the like i saie of the criticall daies that is the and the daie after that a man beginnes to be sicke for they are grouded vpon the aspects of the moone which are not to be regarded and the climactericall years are not to be obserued as dangerous and dismall the obseruatio of the signes is of the same nature for the signes are nothing els but parts of the first mooueable which is but a supposed heauen therefore there is no danger in the thing but in our conceit we are to feare god and not to feare the starres neither are we to make differences of daies in respect of them as though the affaires we take in hand should prosper the better or the worse in respect of their different operation god commandement is feare not the signes of heauen ierem and good reason for no man can by learning knowe the operation of the starrs because their lights and operations are all mixed togither in all places vpon earth and therefore no obseruation can be made of this or that starre more then of this or that hearbe when all hearbes are mixed and compounded togither againe the operation of the starres is by their light and light hath no operation but in heat or cold moisture or drinesse in this respect though we may well obserue the full and the change of the moone it is foolishnesse to ascribe the regiment of our affaires to the starres they beeing matters contingent which depend on the will and pleasure of man lastly it is a great ouersight to hold sundrie of the starres to be malignant and infortunate in respect of vs whereas they are the creatures of god and their light serues for the good of man in a word we are not to make difference of daies neither in respect of holines nor in respect of good or badde successe v i am afraid ampc in these words the apostle sets forth the greatnesse of the apostasie of the galatians by the effect thereof which was to cause him to feare least he had bestowed labour in vaine amog them first the occasion of the words must be considered and that is expressed in the former words ye obserue daies and moneths and hereupon he saith j am in feare of you and thus paul teacheth that workes set vp as causes of saluation with christ make void the ministerie and grace of god it may be said this is meant of ceremoniall workes and so it is true i answer it is indeed spoken of ceremoniall workes but it must be inlarged to all workes without exception for paul saith c v if ye be circumcised ye are bound to fulfill the whole lawe hence then it followes that the doctrine of iustification by workes is an errour in the foundation and beeing distinctly and obstinately maintained there is no hope of saluation againe here we see the fidelitie of the apostle paul and it stands in two things the first is his painefull and wearisome labour to gaine the galatians to god the second is his care that the foresaid labour be not in vaine and in this example of his we learne three things the first that they which are or desire to be dispensers of the word must doe it not for the bellie or for lucres sake or for the praise of man but simply for this ende that they may gaine soules to god the scribe that would haue followed christ for gaine was repelled with this answer that christ had not so much as a place where to lay his head math and to preach for by respects is to make a marchandise of the word of god corinthian the second is that ministers after the example of paul must be labourers indeed corinthian and workemen tim and they must shewe themselues to be so by their care and industrie in winning soules to god and it is not sufficient now and then to make a discourse vpon a text thirdly ministers of the word must be watchmen ezech and heb their office is not onely to gaine and call man to god but also to preserue and keepe them in christ which are alreadie called thirdly here we see the condition of the church of galatia and of all other visible churches vpon earth that they are subiect to apostasie it may be said how can this be considering true beleeuers cannot fall away ans in the visible church on earth there are foure kinds of beleeuers the first are they which heare the word without zeale and they are like the stony ground the second are they which heare knowe and approoue the word the third are they which heare knowe and approoue the word and haue a taste of the power thereof and accordingly yeeld some outward obedience the fourth are they which heare knowe approoue and keepe the word in that they beleeue it and are turned into the obedience of it the three first may fall quite away the fourth cannot and by this meanes it comes to passe that visible churches vpon earth may fall away because of them that professe the faith three to one may vtterly fall away the vse this must teach vs that are members of the visible church to feare and to suspect our selues and not to content our selues because we haue some good things in vs but we must labour to be sealed vp to the daie of our redemption and to lay vp a good foundation against the time to come tim by seeking to haue in vs such good things as are proper to the elect as vnfained faith in christ and conuersion to god from all our sinnes it may be demanded how pauls labour should be in vaine ans it was in vaine in respect of his owne desire and affection to saue all the galatians secondly it was in vaine in respect of the whole bodie of that church wherof many were hypocrits it was not in vaine in respect of the elect nor in respect of the counsell of god isa againe it may be demanded what must be done when the labours of our callings are in vaine ans we must follow the calling and commandement of god whether we haue good successe or no and whatsoeuer come of it paul feares least his labour is in vaine and yet he still labours when peter had laboured all night and caught nothing he saith at the commandement of christ in thy word will i cast out my net luke and thus to doe whatsoeuer follows is true wisedome and the feare of god for it must suffice vs that the worke we take in hand is pleasing vnto god and though it be in vaine in respect of man it is not so before god isa and corinthian this must euery man remember in his place and calling for the establishing of his minde against all euents v be you as i for i am euen as you i beg you brother ye haue not hurt me at all the words in this verse to the verse are an answer to an obiection the obiection is this we see now by these sharpe reproofes that paul hath changed his minde toward vs and that he hath turned his loue into hatred the answer is be as i i am as you the speech is very effectuall and significant and it is like the common prouerb amicus alter ego alter idem that is a mans friend is all one with himselfe the sense of the words is be as i looke that your minds be not estranged from me but tender me euen as your own selues for i paul am the same that euer i was i respect and tender you euen as mine own selfe and least the galatians should say see ye not how paul commands imperiously be ye as i therefore he addes i beg you brother i command you not in the next words he addes a reason of his answer thus hatred presupposeth a hurt or wrong to be done ye haue done me no hurt or wrong therefore ye may not thinke that i hate you when paul saith be as i i am as you we learne that there must be a speciall and mutuall loue betweene the teachers and the people paul saith that he did inlarge his heart for the corinthians and he requires the like of them corinthian teachers must shewe their loue by tendering the saluation of the people by all meanes euen as their own soules paul could haue found in his heart to haue beene accursed for his countrimen the iewes rom he desired that he might be offered vp as a drinke offer vpon the sacrifice of the faith of the philippians philipp when the israelites had sinned moses stands in the breach as it were in the face of the canon betweene the wrath of god and them by his praier to stay the iudgement of god psalm againe the people must shew their loue to their teachers first by praying for them as for themselues rom secondly by hauing in singular price the worke of the ministery thess and that is by wholsome doctrine to repaire the image of god and to erect the kingdome of god in the hearts of man when this thing is loued and desired then are ministers loued this mutuall loue is of great vse it incourageth people to obay and the preachers of the word to labour in teaching when paul saith i beg you brother he shewes what moderation is to be vsed in all reproofes he tells the galatians his minde plainly to the full and withall he indeauours to shew his owne loue to them and to keepe theirs it may be asked how paul can say ye haue done me no hurt at all for when a beleeuer in corinthian committed incest paul tooke it for a wrong to himselfe corinthian and no doubt to call the doctrine of the apostle into question was a great wrong vnto him i answer the wrong was no wrong in his estimation and affection who was content to put vp and to forgiue the wrong here we see the meeknes of paul in that he quietly beares the crosses and wrongs laid vpon him the like was in moses who yeares together indured the bad manners of the israelites act but the perfect example of this vertue is in christ who saued the that crucified him we likewise are to exercise our selues in this vertue and that we may indeede so doe we must first of all haue a sense of our spirituall pouertie and a faith in the mercie presence and protection of god againe marke the minde of the apostle that he may winne soules to god he is content to suffer any wrong the priests and iesuits among vs in england are content to venter life and limme that they may win proselytes to the church of rome much more then must the true ministers of the gospel be content with any condition so they may gaine man to god in this case hurts and abuses must be no hurts nor abuses and ye know how through the infirmitie of the flesh i preached the gospel vnto you at the first and the triall of me which was in my flesh ye despised not neither abhorred but receiued me as an angel of god yes as christ iesus what then was your felicitie for i beare you record that if it had beene possible you would haue plucked out your eyes to haue giuen them to me am i therefore become your enemie because i tell you the truth the answer to the obiection in the former verse was this be as j i am as you and the reason was this hatred presupposeth an offence ye haue done me no offence or hurt therefore ye may not thinke that i hate you the minor is in the v the conclusion in the v againe the minor ye haue done me no hurt is confirmed in the verses the summe of the argument is this though my outward condition was subiect to contempt yet did the galatians shew loue and reuerence to me therefore ye did me no hurt againe paul sets forth both the parts of his argument and first of all he describes his owne condition by three things that he preached in weaknesse of the flesh that he preached the first that he preached hauing the triall of himselfe in his owne flesh secondly the loue and reuerence of the galatians is set out by three signes or effects they despised him not they receiued him as an angel or as christ himselfe they would haue plucked out their eyes to haue done him good the first thing in pauls condition is that he published the gospel in the infirmitie of his flesh that is in a meane and base estate without the shew of humane wisdome and authority and subiect to many miseries in this sense paul opposeth infirmitie to the excellencie of humane wisdome corinthian and vnder it he comprehends all the calamities and troubles that befell him corinthian this was the condition of the rest of the apostles for they were but fishers and preached the word in their fisherlike simplicitie nay this was the condition of christ himselfe for he hid the maiestie of his godhead vnder the vaile of his flesh and his outward man was subiect to reproch and contempt isa and this is the order of god the word must be dispensed in the infirmitie of mans flesh for sundrie causes first that we might not exalt our teachers aboue their condition who are no more but instruments of grace when the man of derbe and listra would haue offered sacrifice to paul and barnabas paul forbids them saying that they were man subiect to the same passions with themselues act the second cause that we might ascribe the whole worke of our conuersion not to man but to god alone corinthian the third is that god might by this meanes confound the wisdom of the world and cause man that would be wise to become fooles that they might be wise corinthian the last is that we might be assured that the doctrine of the apostles is of god because it preuailes in the world without the strength and pollicie of man and as the word is preached in weaknes so it is beleeued of man and the grace of god is conferred to vs and continued in vs in the weaknes of the flesh god loue is shedde abroad in the hearts of man but when euen then when we are in the midst of manifold afflictions rom paul beares about him the mortification of our lord iesus not for his damnation but that the life of god might be manifest in his mortall flesh corinthian and he saith plainly that the grace of god is made perfect through weaknesse corinthian by this we are taught a high point in religion and that is not onely to be content with the miseries and troubles of this life but to reioyce therein because when we are weakest we are strongest and when we thinke our selues forsaken of god in the time of distresse we are not forsaken indeede but haue his speciall fauour and protection corinthian let this be thought vpon for the works of god in the cause of mans saluation are in and by their contraries this is the manner of god dealing the second thing is that paul preached the gospel to the galatians at the first as it were breaking the ise where none had preached before in this he claimes his priuiledge that he was to be esteemed as a master builder that laid the foundation of the church of galatia and withall he giues a close item to the false apostles who did not plant churches but onely corrupt them after they were planted againe paul here notes the condition of god church or kingdome in which first comes the husbandman and sowes good seede and then after comes the deuill with his tares matth and all this is euident in the church of galatia first planted by paul and then seduced by false teachers the third thing is that paul preached bearing about him the triall of god this triall is a worke of god whereby he discouers vnto vs and to the world either the grace or the corruption of our hearts thus god tried abraham hebr the israelites deut and ezechias chronicle and paulin this place the vse we must not thinke it strange when we are afflicted any way nay we must looke for trialls and be content when they come pet iam we are either gold in deede or gold in shew if in deede we must be cast into the furnace that we may be purged if we be gold in appearance we must againe into the furnace that we may be knowne what we are the best vine in the vinyard must be lopped and cut with the pruning knife that it may beare the more fruit ioh againe we must take heede least there be any hidden corruptions raigning in our hearts and we must labour to be indeede that which we appeare to be for we must be tried by god and then that which now lies hidde shall be discouered to our shame lastly we must looke to it that there be soundnes of grace in vs that we may be able to beare the trialls of god and shew forth some measure of faith potience obedience the first signe of reuerence in the galatians is that they did not despise paul in his base condition this is a matter of commendation in them and it is to be followed of vs and he is a blessed man that is not offended at christ math the second signe of reuerence is that they receiued paul as an angel of god or as christ iesus here first we must distinguish betweene pauls person and his doctrine or ministerie and he is said to be receiued as an angel or as christ because his doctrine was receiued euen as if an angel or christ had deliuered it secondly we must put a difference betweene an apostle and all ordinarie pastours and teachers and to be receiued as an angel or as christ properly and simply concerns paul and the rest of the apostles for to them it was said it is not you that speake but the spirit of the father in you math againe he that heareth you heareth me he that despiseth you despiseth me luke the apostles were called of god immediately taught and inspired immediately and immediately gouerned by the spirit both in preaching and writing so as they could not erre in the things which they deliuered to the church and therefore they were to be heard euen as christ himselfe as for other ordinarie teachers they are in part and in the second place to be heard as angels and as christ so farre forth as they follow the doctrine of the apostles thus are they also called the angels of the couenant math and embassadours in the stead of christ corinthian here paul notably expresseth the authoritie and honour of an apostle which is to be heard euen as christ himselfe because in preaching he is the mouth and in writing the hand of god this authoritie is to be maintained and the consideration of it is of great vse the papists say we know the scripture to be the word of god by the testimonie of the church but indeede the principall meanes whereby we are assured touching the truth of scripture is that the books of scripture were penned by man whose writings and sayings we are to receiue euen as from christ himselfe because they had either propheticall or apostolicall authoritie and were immediately taught and inspired in writing and all this may be discerned by the matter for me and circumstances of the foresaid books secondly they are to be blamed that call the pope the spouse of the church and christ by annointment as bernard did for thus is he more then an apostle thirdly here we see the goodnesse of god that doth not speake to vs in his maiestie but appoints man in his stead who are his embassadours to beg vs to be reconciled to him fourthly there must be fidelitie in teachers because they stand in teaching in the stead of christ and therefore must onely deliuer that which they knowe to be the will of christ fiftly they must haue a speciall care of holinesse of life because they speake in the name and roome of god read leuit sixtly the people are to heare their teachers with all reuerence euen as if they would heare the very angels of god or christ himselfe seauenthly the comfort of the ministerie is as sure and certen as if an angel came downe from heauen or christ himselfe to comfort vs so be it we doe indeed truely turne to god and repent verse what was your felicitie that is you esteemed it to be your felicitie that you receiued me and my doctrine ye would haue plucked out your eies and haue giuen them to me a prouerbiall speech signifying the speciall loue of the galatians to paul so as nothing which they had could be to deare for him if it had bin possible this he saith because no ma can pluck out his eie to doe another man good or thus no man can possibly giue his eie and the sight thereof to another in these words paul sets downe the third signe of the loue and reuerence which the galatians shewed to him and that is that they thought themselues happie by reason of pauls ministerie and would haue parted with their owne eies for his good hence we learne that there is a felicitie after the time of this life and that is to receiue and imbrace the doctrine of the gospell so saith christ else where luke and math true happinesse stands in our reconciliation with god in christ and this reconciliation is offered and giuen vs on god part by his word and promise and it is receiued of vs when we turne to god and by faith rest on the said promise to be in god kingdome is happinesse and this is the kingdome of god when we resigne our selues in subiection to his will and word the preaching of the word is the key of this kingdome matth and when it is receiued into our hearts by faith heauen is set open vnto vs euen in this life ioh the philosophers therefore haue erred that place our happinesse in honours riches pleasures or in ciuill vertue secondly our common people are deceiued who thinke because they deale truely and iustly before man that they are in as good a case as they that heare all the sermons in the world as though true happinesse stood in ciuill conuersation thirdly this doctrine serues to beate downe a point of naturall atheisme in the heart of man which makes many thinke it a vaine thing to serue god and to heare his word iob mala dauid was troubled with this corruption psalm many of them which professe the name of christ will not be brought to keep the sabbath daie and in their dealings they vse fraud and lying as other man doe and all is because they thinke they cannot liue by their religion fourthly the onely way to establish a kingdome or common wealth is to plant the gospell there for this makes an happie people and this is the maine cause of our happinesse and successe in this church and land and the obedience of the gospel is it that makes euery man in his trade office and calling whatsoeuer it be to prosper read psalm on the contrarie they are wretched and miserable that liue without the gospell prou corinthian tim to receiue the doctrine of the apostles is an vnfallible marke of the church of god for this is it that makes a people blessed and happie we may not despise the preaching of the word thes if we doe we despise our owne happinesse if it be said preachers sometime are deceiued answer marke the addition of paul prooue all things hold that which is good thess touching the speciall loue of the galatians to paul first it may be demanded what was the cause of it answer the very ministerie of the apostle whose office it was to make disciples math and so to plant the church of the new testament and for this cause he had a priuiledge to preach the truth so as he could not erre in things which he deliuered to the church he preached with authority as hauing power to correct rebellious offenders corinthian and corinthian he preached with vnspeakeablle diligence read act he had a prerogatiue as the rest of the apostles had after he had made disciples by imposition of hands to giue vnto them the extraordinary giftes of the holy ghost act and these are the meanes whereby this speciall loue was procured secondly it may be demanded whether the galatians did not more then keepe the law when they would haue plucked out their owne eyes and haue giuen them to paul for thus they loue him more then their owne selues ans the commandement thou shalt loue thy neighbour as thy selfe doth not prescribe that we must in the first place loue our selues and then in the second loue our neighbour but it setts downe the right manner of louing our neighbour and that is to loue him as hartely and vnfainedly as our owne selues the measure of loue is expressed when christ saith we must loue on another as christ loued vs ioh there is a certen case in which we must consider our neighbour not only as a neighbour but also as a speciall instrument of god and thus are we in some respectes to loue and to preferre him before our selues thus a subiect is more to loue the life of his prince then his own life thus paul was content to be accursed for the israelites rom and the galatians would haue giuen their eies to paul that was so worthy an instrument of the grace of god in their example we are taught to be willing to forsake the dearest things in the world for the gospell of christ euen our eies hands feete yes and our life verse because i tell you the trueth we must after pauls example speake the truth to all man ephesians am i therefore your enemie the conclusion of the apostles argument here we see a corruption of nature which makes vs that we cannot abide to heare the truth in things that are against vs we hate them that speake the truth selfe loue makes vs conceiue the best things of our selues here then learne to search thy heart and life that thou maiest know the very worst by thy selfe if thou wilt not know it now thou shalt know it to thy shame in the day of iudgement be vile and base in thine owne opinion iob last they are iealous ouer you amisse yes they would exclude you that ye should altogether loue them but it is good to loue earnestly alwaies in a good cause and not onely when i am present with you the word zeale hath many significations here it is fittely translated ielousie ye are ielous hereby much is signified that there is a spirituall marriage betweene christ and his church that the church is the bride christ the bridegroome or husband the gospel an instrument drawne touching the marriage the sacraments as seales the graces of the spirit as loue tokens the ministers of christ as friends of the bridegroome and suters for him in this respect they put on the affection of christ and are zealous for him this ielousie is twofold pretended ielousie and true ielousie pretended ielousie is when man falsely pretend the loue of the church for christs sake thus paul saith they are ielous that is they pretend a loue vnto you for christs sake but indeede they doe it amisse and the reason follows they would exclude you namely from louing of me others read the wordes thus they would exclude vs the difference in the original is onely in one letter and the sense is the same that the false apostles would exclude paul from the loue of the galatians that they onely might be honoured and loued jt is good these words may be vnderstood either of the galatians or of paul i rather choose to applie them to paul that for ielousie he may make an opposition betweene himselfe and the false teachers the sense is this that ielousie is a good thing if it be in a good cause that is if it be indeede for christs sake and be alwaies the same and paul addes further that this kind of ielousie is in himselfe because he is ielous ouer the galatians not onely when he is present with them but also when he is absent and this he further confirmes in the two next verses the scope in these wordes paul meetes with a conceit of the galatians for they might happely say that their new teachers loued them exceedingly and were zealous for their saluation paul therefore answers by a comparison thus they are ielous ouer you but it is amisse nay ielousie for you is good the first part of the comparison is in the verse the second in the the vse when paul saith that the false apostles were ielous ouer the galatians amisse he sets out the fashion of man in the world which is to doe things which are good in their kind but to doe them for wrong ends it is an excellent office to preach the word but some doe it of envy and contention philipp others make marchandise of the word it is an excellent thing to imbrace the gospel and yet many man doe it amisse for feare or for honour or for profit or for other sinister respect and not for the gospels sake this temporall life is an excellent thing yet few there are that know the ende of this life for man commonly spend not their time to seeke the kingdome of heauen and to serue god in seruing of man but with all their might they aime at honours profit pleasures and thus they liue amisse not for the honour of god but for themselues this must teach vs not onely to doe good but to doe it well and to propound good ends to our selues and to seeke to be vpright in the statutes of god psalm to this ende three things must be done first we must set before vs the will and commandement of god and this must mooue vs to doe the good we doe secondly the outward action must be conformable to the inward motions of the inward man and they must both goe together thirdly we must directly intend to obay god in the things we doe and to approoue our hearts and doings to him in that the false apostles are saide to be ielous or zealous we see how nature can counterfeit grace of god and that which the child of god doth by that the naturall man can doe by nature thus pharao fa repentance exod and ahab that sold himselfe to worke wickednes king and iudas in the midst of his despaire is said to repent matthew daily experience shewes the like in such persons who in their extremitie with teares vse to bewaile their liues past and with many vowes and protestations promise amendment and yet afterward when they are on foote againe they returne to their old bias in a word there is nothing that the godly man doth by the spirit of god spiritually but an hypocrite may doe the like carnally nature can play the part of the ape in imitating good things therefore it stands vs in hand to praie and examine our hearts least we be deceiued in our selues for there may lie a depth of deceit and falshood lurking in the heart and that we be not deceiued two things must be obserued one is that we must cherish in our hearts an vniuersall hatred of all and euery sinne first in our selues and then in others the second is that we must be changed and renewed in our minds consciences and affections thirdly here we see the propertie of envy and ambition in these false teachers paul must be excluded from the loue of the galatians that they alone may be loued thus iosua would haue excluded eldad and medad from prophesying and he would haue moses to be the onely prophet but moses saith i would to god all the people could prophecie number iohns disciples would haue excluded christ baptising but john saith he must increase and i must decrease ioh the disciples of christ would haue excluded one that cast out deuills in the name of christ but did not follow him and christ forbad them luke lastly we here see the propertie of deceiuers is to make a diuision betweene the pastors and the people beside the former pretended ielousie there is a good ielousie which the apostle takes to himselfe and els where he calls it the ielousie of god corinthian this ielousie presupposeth the office of the apostles and all ministers which stands in three things the first is to become suters to the church or to the soules of man in the name of christ and to make the offer or motion in his name of a spirituall marriage and this is done in the ministerie and dispensation of the gospel the second is to make the contract betweene mens soules and christ now to the making of a contract the consent of both the parties at the least is required christ giues his consent in the word ose and we giue our consent to him and choose him for our head when we turne to god and beleeue in christ and the ministerie of the word serues to signifie the will of christ vnto vs and to stirre vp our hearts to an holy consent the third is after the contract to preserue them in true faith and good life that they may be fit to be presented to christ in the day of iudgement and so be married to him eternally for then and not before is the marriage of the lambe these duties are all noted by paul when he saith that he prepared the corinthians that he might present them as a pure virgin vnto christ corinthian and because this charge and office is laid vpon the apostles and ministers therefore they are said to be ielous this ielousie stands in three things the first is to loue the church indeede and truth for christs sake the second is to feare least by reason of weaknes and by meanes of the temptations of the deuill the church and they that beleeue should fall away from christ the third is after the fall of the church to be angrie with holy anger and indignation for christs sake thus moses was ielous when the israelites worshipped the golden calfe and elijah with like zealessue the priests of baal thus is paul said to be ielous in this place and act if the apostle be thus ielous how much more then is christ himselfe ielous who hath espoused himselfe to his church this plainly shewes that he cannot brooke either partner or deputy and therefore his sacrifice on the crosse must stand without the sacrifice of the masse his intercession without the intercession of saints his merits without the merit of workes his satisfaction without any satisfaction of ours he will haue the heart alone and all the heart or nothing and he will not giue any part of his honour to any other this ielousie in the ministers must teach all faithfull servant of god that they keepe themselues as pure virgin for christ and set their hearts on nothing in the world but on him therefore they must hunger after christ they must account all things dongue for him they must haue their conuersation in heauen with him and loue his comming vnto the by death psalm contrariwise they that set their hearts on any other thing beside him are said to goe a whoring from him and therefore they are accursed psalm thus many protestant doe in their practise whatsoeuer they professe thus doth the church of rome both in word and deede for beside christ shee hath many other louers and shee goes a whoring after them when shee worships angels and saints the images of god and christ with religious worship againe by this we are put in minde to yeeld an vniuersall subiection to christ for this is the dutie of the espoused wife to her husband lastly that good things may be well done good ends must be propounded and we must be constant in the good which we doe and thus paul saith it is a good thing to be iealous my little children of whome i trauell in birth againe till christ be formed in you i would i were nowe with you that i might change my voice for i am in feare of you paul hath said before that his iealousie ouer the galatians was good because it was in a good cause and it was constant not only in his presence but euen in his absence and this he declares here by two signes his loue now in his absence in the verse and his desire in the second verse the word translated i trauel in birth signifies not only the trauel of the woman at the birth of the child but also the painefull bearing thereof before the birth and the words haue this sense o ye galatians once heretofore i bare and brought you forth when i first preached christ vnto you and because now ye are reuolted from my doctrine i am constrained once againe to beare you and to trauell with you in my ministerie till by the operation of the holy ghost the right knowledge and the true image of christ defaced by the false apostles be once againe reformed and restored in these words my little children paul takes to him the condition of a mother and he signifies his most tender and motherly affection to the galatians it is the fashion of mothers when their children prosper and doe well to reioyce when they are sicke or die to mourne exceedingly and to be mooued with pitie and compassion the galatians deserued no loue at pauls hand for their apostasie was very foule yet because there were some good things remaining in them and there was hope of recouerie he inlargeth his bowels towards them and shewes his loue with compassion if this be the case with paul then great is the loue and compa ion of god to his children if the child be sicke and froward the mother doth not cast it forth of the dores but shee tenders it and carefully lookes vnto it much more then will the lord haue pittie and compassion here then a maine comfort is to be remembred if we be of the number of them that beleeue in christ haung vice amp hauing a care to please god our weakenesses and falls of weakenesse doe not abolish the mercie of god but are occasions to illustrate the same the weekenesse of the chide stirs vp compassion in the mother and dauid saith as a father hath compassion on his children so hath the lord compassion on them that feare him and marke the reason for he knowes our frame amp that we are but dust psalm when paul saith i trauell he signifies the measure of his ministeriall paines that they were as the trauell of a woman with child and this he shewes plainely in the particulars corinthian elijah that was sent in his time to restore religion was at length so wearied in this businesse that he desired the lord to take him out of the world king the paines of the prophet isai made him crie my leannes my leannes amp ieremie cries my bellie my bellie signifying that his griefes and his paines in the ministerie were as the paine of the colicke by this we see that they haue much to answer for before god that are in this calling and yet take little or no paines therein and that they which take the most paines come farre short of their dutie againe when he saith i trauell he signifies the dignitie of the ministerie that it is an instrument appointed of god for the worke of regeneration for paul compares himselfe to a woman in trauell and the worke of his ministerie to the trauell it selfe whereby children are borne to god this serues very well to stoppe their mouthes that condemne the vocall and externall ministerie when he saith i trauell againe he teacheth that if man fall after their first initiall repentance there is still a possibilitie of mercie and place for a second repentance we must forgiue till seaventie seauen times mat much more will god doe it the parable of the prodigall son shewes that they which fall fro god after their calling and first conuersion may againe by newe repentance be recouered an obiection pauls second trauell presupposeth a second regeneration in the galatians and if they are borne againe the second time then in their apostasie they fell wholly from god answer when paul saith j trauell againe he doth not presuppose any second spirituall generation for the child of god is but once begotten to the lord and paul here calls the galatians little children because euen in the time of their fall the seede of god still remained in their hearts and because the image of christ was againe to be reformed and restored in the galatians in this respect he saith i trauell againe of you the end of pauls ministerie is expressed in the words till christ be formed in you that is till as it were the counterfeit or image of christ be stamped and imprinted in your hearts this image hath two parts the first is a right knowledge of christ in respect of his natures and offices as they are set forth in the word this knowledge was defaced in the galatians when they ioyned workes with christ for then they made him to be an imperfect sauiour the second part of this image is a conformitie with christ rom it is twofold conformitie in qualitie and conformitie in practise conformitie in qualitie is againe twofold the first is a conformitie to the death of christ when the vertue thereof works in vs a death of sinne and when we suffer as christ suffered in silence contentation obedience subiecting our selues to the will of god the second is a conformitie to the resurrection or life of christ and that is when we liue not onely a naturall but also a spirituall life which is to submit our selues to be ruled by the word and spirit of christ conformitie in practise is when we carrie ourselues as prophets in the confession of the name of christ in teaching exhorting and admonishing one another as priests to offer our body and soules in sacrifice to god as spiritual kings bearing sway ouer the lusts and corruptions of our own hearts and thus is christ to be framed in the hearts of man the vse here we see the end of all preaching is to make sinnefull man to become new creatures like vnto christ this is the drift of the ministerie and the doctrine that tends to this purpose is sound and wholesome againe here we see that in the new testament there is but one rule and order for all man and that is the rule of christ take vp thy crosse and follow me and for this cause the ministerie serues to frame christ in the hearts of all beleeuers therefore the seuerall rules and orders of monkes and friars in the church of rome are meere superstitions furthermore paul here makes two degrees of god children one is when they are begotten of god and christ is formed in them the second is when they are begotten of god yet so as they are as yet vnformed such were the apostles when they confessed christ to be the son of the liuing god math for then they knewe not the article of christs death resurrection ascension at that time nor the manner of his kingdome of this sort was rahab when shee receiued the spies heb for then shee was not informed in the religion of the iewes but only acknowledged the god of israel to be the true god and had a resolution to ioyne her selfe to the people of god of this sort were the corinthians at the first for they were carnall more then spirituall euen babes in christ corinthian this must teach vs where we see any good thing in man to cherish it for though as yet they be not christians formed yet they may be christians in forming when paul saith vntill christ be formed he shewes that the conuersion of a sinner is not wrought in one moment but by little and little in processe of time in the generation of infants first the braine heart and liuer are framed then the bones veines arteries nerues membranes and after this flesh is added and the infant first begins to liue the life of a plant by growing and nourishing then it liues the life of a beast by sense and motion and thirdly the life of a man by the vse of reason euen so god outwardly preuents vs with his word and inwardly he puts into vs knowledge of his wil with the beginnings or seed of faith and repentance as it were a braine and a heart from these beginnings of faith and repentance arise heauenly desires from these desires follows asking seeking knocking and thus the beginnings of faith are increased and man goe on from grace to grace till they be tall man in christ and for this cause we must with constancy vse the good means in hearing reading praying lastly we are all here put in minde to studie and to vse all good meanes that we may be like to christ specially in the disposition of the inward man there is a spirituall madnesse in the mindes of many man they thinke of nothing but of the fashion of their apparell and of the trimming of their body but let vs thinke how to imprint the gratious image of christ in our hearts thus shall we be louely and haue fauour in the eyes of god thus much of pauls loue now follows his desire in the verse in which i consider three things the desire it selfe i would j were with you now the ende of his desire that i might change my voice the occasion thereof for i am in doubt of you when paul saith i would i were with you now he shewes that the presence of pastours with their people is a thing most necessarie and there are two reasons thereof one is to preuent spirituall daungers which are manifold and continuall in that the deuill seekes continually whome he may deuoure and we fight against principality and powers in heauenly things in this respect pastours are called watchmen and ouerseers secondly the presence of pastours with their people serues to redresse things amisse and to recouer them that be in apostasie as paul saith in this place therefore it were to be wished that this mind of paul were in all pastours that with one consent they might say to their people i would i were with you n in the words that i might change my voice paul continues the allusion which he made in the former verse to a woman with child and hereby he signifies two things the first is that he will leaue further disputing with the galatians and fall to lamenting and crying as mothers doe in the time of their trauell by reason of their paine this is to change the voice it was the manner of paul to abase himselfe and to mourne for the sinnes of others corinthian and he reprooues the corinthians that they were puffed vp and did not mourne for the incestuous person like was the practise of dauid psalm of lot pet of ieremie lam of the friends of iob iob last of the godly in the daies of ezechiel c of christ in respect of ierusalem luke and it hath bin alwaies the practise of holy man when there was no other helpe with tears to commend the case to god if sorrow for other mens offences make paul change his voice much more are man to doe it for their owne peter in his repentance left his presumptuous speaking and fell to bitter and secret teares and so did the woman that stood at the feete of christ weeping and washed his feete with her teares luke the like ought we to doe for our offences and sinnes the earth quake this winter past must stirre vs vp to this dutie for it is a matter full of terrour sam and the sicknesse which hath taken hold of thousands as a gentle warning must be respected and it must be considered that the changes of the great world bring with them like changes in the little world that is in the body of man againe to change the voice is to conferre with the galatians and vpon conference to temper his voice to their manners and condition as nources stammer and lispe with children for some are with pitie to be recouered and some with terrour iud hence i gather that the conference of pastours and people is a thing very necessarie paul here ascribes more to it then to his epistle it is the life of preaching for by it the teachers know better what to teach and the people better to conceiue things that are taught here then we see a common fault man are content to heare but they will not conferre with their teachers and in the time of sicknesse the first person that is conferred with is the physitian and the minister is last sent for whereas on the contrarie the cure of the soule is the cure of the bodie iob againe here is set downe the way to attaine all good learning and that is that learners be present with their teachers and the teachers againe temper their voices to the capacitie of the learners thus samuel was with eli at the dore of the tabernacle thus christ was in the temple among the doctours hearing them and asking them questions luke thirdly paul here sets downe the way to make a pacification for religion in these last daies and the way is that the pastours of the church be assembled together by the authoritie of princes and beeing assembled they temper their voices one to another according to the written word thus may they that lic now vnder the apostasie of antichrist be recouered act and the promise of god is that when two or three come together in his name he will be with them matth lastly the ministers as here we see are to temper their gifts and speach to the condition of their hearers the corinthians were babes in christ and paul feedes them with milke corinthian to the iew he became a iew to the gentile a gentile that he might winne some corinthian for this cause it were to be wished that catechising were more vsed then it is of our ministers for our people are for the most part rude and vncatechised and therefore they profit little or nothing by sermons a sermon to such persons is like a great loafe set before a child and it is no disgrace for learned ministers in plaine and familiar manner to catechise for this is to lay the foundation without which all labour in building is in vaine againe our ignorant people should be content euen in their old age to learne the catechisme for by reason of their ignorance they lie as a pray to the atheist and papist and in much hearing they learne little because they know not the grounds of doctrine that are vsually in all sermons and it is a fault in many that they loue to heare sermons which are beyond their reach in which they stand and wonder at the preacher and plaine preaching is little respected of such the occasion of pauls desire is in these words i doubt of you or thus i am in perplexitie for you and this paul speakes as a mother in some dangerous extremitie in the time of her trauel as rachel was in the birth of benjamin gen and the words carrie this sense i am troubled for your recouerie and i feare it will neuer be here we learne how daungerous a thing it is to fall from grace though it be but in part for a man cannot recouer himselfe when he will we doe not the good we can vnlesse god make vs doe it ezech cant ier therefore it is an errour to thinke that we may repent and turne to god when we will as many suppose and this must be a warning vnto vs to preserue the good things that god hath put into vs and not to quench the spirit and though paul doubt of the recouerie of the galatians yet he spares not to send his epistle to them and to vse meanes and thus in desperate cases we must vse the best meanes and leaue the successe to god thus the israelites when there was no other helpe went into the sea as into their death bedde or graue by faith staying themselues on the promise of god heb chronicle that which paul here saith may be saide of many among vs in whome christ is not yet framed whether we respect knowledge or good life for they giue iust occasion of doubting whether they will euer turne to god or no tell me ye that will be vnder the law doe ye not heare the law for it is written that abraham had two sonnes one by a servant and an other by a free woman but he which was of the servant was borne after the flesh and he which was of the free woman by promise from the verse of this chapter to the verse paul hath handled the conclusion of the principall argument of this epistle touching the apostasie of the galatians and here he returnes againe to his former doctrine touching the iustification of a sinner by faith without the workes of the law and he confirmes it by an other argument the summe and substance whereof is this your libertie from the law w prefigured in the familie of abraham therefore ye are not bondmen to the law but freemen the argument is at large propounded and it hath foure parts a preface in the verse an historie of abraham and his familie verse the application of the historie from the verse to the the conclusion v and first of the preface law the word law in the first place is taken properly for the morall and ceremoniall lawe of moses and in the second place for the bookes of moses and namely for the booke of genesis and in this sense the word is taken when christ is said to expound the law and the prophets luke and sometime it signifies all the bookes of the old testament ioh vnder the law to be vnder the lawe is to hold our selues bound to the fulfilling of the lawe and to looke for life eternall thereby doe ye not heare the law that is ye read and heare indeede but ye vnderstand not the scope and drift of that which you read in this preface first paul meetes with the pride of mans nature whereby the galatians went about to establish their owne righteousnesse by the lawe when he saith ye that will be vnder the lawe ampc with this pride were the iewes tainted rom and the young prince that came to christ and said good master what must i doe to be saued and the papists of our time who will not be subiect to the iustice of god but set vp their owne iustice in the keeping of the law the like doe the ignorant people among vs who hold that they are able to fulfill the law and that they are to be saued thereby and when they say they looke to be saued by their faith they vnder stand thereby their fidelitie that is their good dealing againe paul here notes the seruile disposition of man that loues rather to be in bondage vnder the law then to be in perfect libertie vnder the grace of god this we see in daily experience all professe christ among vs yet is it euen a death to the most to forsake the bodage of the flesh christ we professe yet so as we take libertie to liue after the lustes of our owne hearts when paul saith doe ye not heare the lawe he notes the cause of our spirituall pride and of the seruile disposition before named namely ignorance in mistaking and misconceiuing the true scope of the law for the galatians did not consider that christ was the scope of the lawe but they supposed that the very obseruation of the lawe euen since the fall of man did giue life and iustifie this ignorance was to the iewes as a vaile before their eies in the reading of the lawe corinthian and this ignorance hath blinded the papist at this day for he supposeth that the gospell is nothing els but the lawe of moses amp that christ indeed is but an instrument to make vs keepers of the lawe and consequently sauiours of our selues in the historie of abraham i consider three things the facte of abraham in taking two wiues the euent vpon this fact he had two sonnes by them the condition of these sonnes touching the fact of abraham it may be demanded what is to be iudged thereof the ground to the answer shall be this that marriage is the indiuisible coniunction of one man and one woman onely this christ of purpose teacheth math where he saith that god created them at the first man and woman and not woman v that a man must for sake father and mother and cleaue to his wife not to his wiues v that they twaine shall be one flesh v and in all this christ makes no newe lawe but onely reuiues the first institution of marriage made in paradise and moses hauing set down this diuine institution addes withall that lamech was the first that brake it by taking many wiues now then the answer to the question is twofold some say that abraham and the rest of the patriarks had a dispensation from god to marrie many wiues and therefore that it was no sinne in them of this minde are sundrie learned man both protestant and papists but the answer is onely coniecturall and hath no euidence in scripture the second answer is that god did not approoue the polygamie of the fathers or commend it but did onely tolerate it as a less euill for the preuenting of a greater this tolleration appeares in that god commanded that the king must not multiply his wiues deut and that the child of the hated wife though shee be the second wife if it be first borne shall be the heire deut the occasions of this tolleration were two one was a desire in the patriarches to multiply their posteritie that if it were possible the messias might descend of their line the second was the common custome of man in the east country who made no matter of it to mary many wiues and common custome bred a common errour and a common errour bred common ignorance whereby that which was indeed a sinne was esteemed no sinne it may be obiected if the hauing of many wiues were an offence that abraham and the rest of the holy patriarches liued and died in a sinne without repentance because we finde nothing in scripture teaching their repentance for their sinne answer known sinnes require particular repentance but if sinnes be vnknown or vnconsidered by reason that man are carried away with the sway of the times as the patriarches were a generall repentance sufficeth psalm againe it may be alleadged that abraham tooke agar by the consent of sara ans that sufficeth not to make a full excuse for abraham for if marriage were a meere ciuill contract as it is made by the consent of man and woman so it might be dissolued by like consent but it is more then a ciuill contract because in the making of it beside the consent of the parties the authoritie of god is interposed and therefore saraes consent in giuing agar to abraha is nothing without the allowance of god and we may not thinke that god will allowe of that which is directly against his owne ordinance thirdly it may be alleadged that if the hauing of may wiues be a fault then abraham and the rest were adulterers ans not so the polygamie of the fathers is to be placed in the middle betweene adulterie and holy wedlocke they tooke not wiues of a leude minde for the satisfying of their lust but of a conscience not rightly informed in this point the euent vpon the facte of abraham was that his two wiues bare him two sonnes he had indeed more sonnes by ketura gen but these two ismael and isaac are onely here mentioned because by the speciall appointment of god they were ordained as types of true beleeuers and hypocrites read rom the condition of the children is set forth by a double difference the first is that one was borne of a bonde woman amp therefore a bondman the other of a free woman and therefore a free man and the heire here it may be demanded how the same person can be both a wife and a bond woman answer among the heathen as also among the iewes there were two sorts of wiues of the first kinde were they that were ioynt gouernors of the family with the husband and they were called mistresses of the house of the second sort were they that serued onely for propagation and were in all other respects as servant or strangers of the first kind was sara and of the second hagar and ketura the second difference of the children was this one that is ismael was borne after the flesh that is by the strength of nature and according to the fleshly counsel of sara who did substitute hagar into her own roome the other namely isaac was borne by the promise that is according to the order of nature yet not by the strength of nature but by the vertue of the promise of god in the birth of ismael saras desire was good that the promise of god might be accomplished but the meanes was carnall the substitution of her handmaid this is the condition of the godly they inted amp desire the best things but they faile in the manner of doing the spirit stirs vp good motions and the flesh corrupteth them paul saith that to will was present with him but he could not doe that which was good as he ought this must cause vs alwaies to humble our selues for our best works againe we are here taught not to make haste to accomplish our desires but when god promiseth any thing to waite his leasure and in the meane season to liue in subiection sara with all her haste could not preuent god prouidence shee hath her desire in the birth of ismael but yet he is borne according to the flesh in bondage and he is not the promised seed in the birth of isaac we see the vertue of the promise of god when it is mixed with our faith for then it makes things possible that are otherwise impossible math if then we desire any good things at the hands of god our dutie is in silence and patience to rest on the promises of god and then our desire shall indeed be accomplished by the which things another thing is meant for these mothers are the two testaments the one which is agar of mount sina which gendreth to bondage for agar or sina is a mountaine in arabia and it answereth to ierusalem which now is and shee is in bondage with her children the application of the former here beginneth and the sense of the wordes is an other thing meant the wordes are thus these things are spoken by allegorie that is one thing is said and an other thing is meant two mothers agar and sara are two they represent or signifie the two testaments est is put for significat of the two testaments i will speake afterward the one the one testament which is the couenant of works which is agar which testament is figured by agar is of mount sina came from mount sina where the law was deliuered to the israelites and gendreth to bondage that is it makes all them bondmen that looke to be iustified and saued by the works of the law for agar or sina here the translatours are deceiued supposing that mount sina had two names agar and sina but this opinion of theirs hath no ground and the words are thus to be read agar is sina here agar signifies not so much the person of abrahams handmaid as that which is said in the former historie of agar for the words are and sina must be considered as a place where it pleased god to publish the law and the wordes thus considered haue this sense agar is sina that is agar figures sina two waies first in condition for as agar was a bondwoman so sina in respect of the law was a place of bondage and in this respect also it is called sina of arabia which was a desart out of the land of canaan secondly in effect for as agar bare ismael a bondman to abraham so sina or the law makes bondmen and it answereth sina answereth to ierusalem that is as agar figures sina so agar figures ierusalem and by this meanes sina and ierusalem are like and stand both in one order now agar figures ierusalem two waies in condition and effect in condition for as agar was a bondwoman so ierusalem or the nation of the iewes refusing christ and looking to be saued by the law are in spirituall bondage in effect for as agar brings forth ismael a bondman so ierusalem by teaching the law makes bondmen therefore paul saith in the last place of ierusalem and shee is in bondage with her children the vse these things are said by allegorie here the papists make a double sense of scripture one literall the other spirituall literall is twofold proper when the words are taken in their proper signification figuratiue when the holy ghost signifies his meaning in borrowed tearmes spirituall senses they make three one allegoricall when things in the old testament are applied to signifie things in the new testament the second is tropologicall when scripture signifies something touching manners the third is anagogicall when things are in scripture applied to signifie the estate of euerlasting life thus ierusalem properly is a citie by allegorie the church of the new testament in a tropologicall sense a state well ordered in an anagogicall sense the estate of eternall life these senses they vse to applie to most places of the scripture specially to the historie but i say to the contrarie that there is but one full and intire sense of euery place of scripture and that is also the literall sense sometimes expressed in proper and sometimes in borrowed or figuratiue speaches to make many senses of scripture is to ouerturne all sense and to make nothing certen as for the three spirituall senses so called they are not senses but applications or vses of scripture it may be said that the historie of abrahams familie here propounded hath beside his proper and literall sense a spiritual or mysticall sense i answer they are not two senses but two parts of one full amp intire sense for not onely the bare historie but also that which is therby signified is the ful sense of the h g againe here we see the scripture is not onely penned in proper tearmes but also in sundrie diuine figures and allegories the song of salomon is an allegorie borrowed from the fellowshippe of man and wife to signifie the communion betweene christ amp his church amp so is the psalme the booke of daniel and the reuelation is an allegoricall historie the parables of the old and new testaments are figures or allegories when dauid saith psalm ride on vpon the word of truth meeknes and iustice he describes a princes charriot by allegorie the guide is the word the horse that draw it are three truth meekenes iustice and thus the throne of god is described by like allegorie psalm v the foundation of the throne are righteousnes and equitie the maine bearers to goe before the throne are mercie and truth it may be demanded when doth the scripture speake properly and when by figure ans if the proper signification of the words be against common reason or against the analogie of faith or against good manners they are not then to be taken properly but by figure the words of christ ioh i am the true vine amp my father is an husband man if they be taken properly they are absurd in common reason therefore the words are figuratiue and the sense is this i am as the true vine and my father as an husbandman the wordes of christ take eate this is my body corinthian verse taken properly are against the articles of faith he ascended into heauen and sits at the right hand of god and they are against the sixt commandement thou shalt not kill and therefore they must be expounded by figure thus this bread is a signe of my bodie the like is to be said of other places they must be taken properly if it be possible if not by figure here then they are to be blamed that make the vse of rhetoricke in the bible to be a meere fopperie for to this purpose there is a booke in english heretofore published as also they of the familie of loue are iustly to be condemned who in another extremitie turne all the bible to an allegorie yes euen that which is said of adam and of christ they are two testaments they are that is they signifie and so agar is sina a mountaine in arabia that is signifies sina thus the rocke in the wildernes is christ corinthian that is figures christ like to this is the sacramentall phrase this is my bodie that is to say this bread signifies my bodie great is the madnes of man that hence gather transsubstantiation or the real conuersion of bread into the bodie of christ they might as well gather hence the conuersion of agar into mount sina the two testaments are the couenant of workes and the couenant of grace one promising life eternall to him that doth all things contained in the law the other to him that turnes and beleeues in christ and it must be obserued that paul saith they are two that is two in substance or kind and they are two sundrie waies the law or couenant of workes propounds the bare iustice of god without mercie the couenant of grace or the gospel reueales both the iustice and mercie of god or the iustice of god giuing place to his mercie secondly the law requires of vs inward and perfect righteousnes both for nature and action the gospel propounds vnto vs an imputed iustice resient in the person of the mediatour thirdly the law promiseth life vpon condition of works the gospel promiseth remission of sinnes and life euerlasting vpon condition that we rest our selues on christ by faith fourthly the law was written in tables of stone the gospel in the fleshie tables of our heart ier corinthian fiftly the law was in nature by creation the gospel is aboue nature and was reuealed after the fall sixtly the law hath moses for the mediatour deut but christ is the mediatour of the new testament heb lastly the law was dedicated by the blood of beast exod amp the new test by the blood of christ heb here then falls to the ground a maine pillar in popish religion which is that the law of moses and the gospel are all one law for substance and that the difference lies in this that the law of moses is darke and imperfect and the gospel or the law of christ more perfect because he hath as they say added counsells to precepts againe the law they say without the spirit is the law properly and with the spirit it is the gospel but all this is false which they teach for the two testaments the law and the gospel are two in nature substance or kind and the difference lies not in the presence or absence of the spirit and whereas the papists make two iustifications the first meerely by grace the second by workes besides the two testaments they must establish a third testament compounded of both and it must be partly legall and partly euangelicall otherwise the twofold iustification cannot stand for the law propounds onely one way of iustification and the gospel a second the doctrine therefore that propounds both is compounded of both god did not approoue the polygamie of abraham yet doth he vse it to signifie the greatest mysterie of our religion here we see a great point of the diuine prouidence of god who ordereth and vseth well the things which he doth not approoue this is the foundation of our patience and a meanes of true comfort ioseph thus comforts himselfe and his brother that god ordered and disposed their bad enterprise to his and their good gen here againe paul sets downe two properties of the testament of workes or of the law the first is that it came from mount sina and here lies the difference betweene the law and the gospel the law is from sina the gospel from sion or ierusalem for there it was first to be preached and thence conueied to all nation mich ezech the second propertie of the law is that it gendreth to bondage because it maketh them bond man that looke to be saued and iustified thereby and this it doth by reuealing sinne and the punishment thereof which is euerlasting death and by conuincing all man of their sinnes and of their deserued condemnation in this respect it is called the ministerie of death corinthian and paul saith that after he knew his sins by the lawe he died and the lawe was the meanes of death vnto him rom here is another difference between the law and the gospel the lawe genders to bondage the gospell genders to life for it is an instrument of the spirit for the beginning and confirming of our regeneration and saluation and so is not the law which is no cause but only an occasion of the grace of god in vs where as ierusalem that now is is said to be in bondage as sina and hagar it is to be obserued that there is no church in the world nor people which is not subiect to apostasie for god had made great and large promises to ierusalem psalm and and yet for all this ierusalem by refusing christ and by establishing the iustice of the lawe is comne into bondage and depriues herselfe of the inheritance of eternall life therefore it is a falshood which the papists teach that the infallible assistance of the spirit is tyed to the chaire and consistorie of the pope so as he and consequently the church of rome cannot erre here againe we see what may be the future condition of england for it may be said of it hereafter england that now is is not that which it hath bin namely a maintainer of the gospell of christ therefore we must not be high minded but feare and now take heed of the first beginning of apostasie the holy ghost heb set down the degrees thereof and they are fiue in number the first is the deceit of sinne the second is the hardening of the heart after man are deceiued by sinne the third is an euill heart which growes vpon hardnesse of heart the fourth is vnbeleefe whereby the word of god is called in question and the trueth thereof and after vnbeleefe followes a departure from god and christ that this may not be we must carefully avoid all the deceits of sinne as namely couetousnes ambition lust ampc againe as agar figures the lawe so doth ismael all iusticiaries that looke to be saued by the law here then we see the condition of the world the greatest part whereof are ismalites for the turke and the iewe looke at this day to be faued by their workes the papist ascribes his conuersion not wholly to grace but partely to grace and partly to nature or the strength of mans will helped by grace and thus are they borne after the flesh as ismael was and our common people though in shew they professe reformed religion yet indeed a great part of them are ismaelites for they looke to be saued by their good seruing of god and by their good deeds and they little thinke on christ and his merits and thus they depriue themselues of all title to eternall life therefore it stands them in hand to condemne nature and the strength thereof and to renounce their owne workes and to rest onely on the promise of mercie for eternall saluation thus shall they be the children of the promise and heires of god lastly in that ierusalem is in bondage like agar or mount sina we see how vaine are the pilgrimages to the holy land amp how needlesse were the war made for the recouery thereof but ierusalem which is aboue is free which is the mother of vs all here paul shewes what is figured by sara namely the new ierusalem which is the catholike church heb revelation and it is here so tearmed because ierusalem was a type thereof in sixe respects first god chose ierusalem aboue all other places to dwell in psalm and the catholike church is the company of predestinate chosen to be a particular people to god secondly ierusalem is a citie compact in it selfe by reason of the bond of loue and order among the citizens psalm in like sort the members of the catholike church are linked togither by the bond of one spirit thirdly in ierusalem was the sanctuarie a place of god presence and of his worship where also the promise of the seed of the woman was preserued till the comming of the messias and now the catholike church is in the roome of the sanctuarie in it must we seeke the presence of god and the word of life therefore it is called the pillar and ground of truth tim fourthly in ierusalem was the throne of dauid psalm and in the catholike church is the throne or scepter of christ figured by the kingdome of dauid reu fiftly the commendation of a cittie as ierusalem is the subiection amp obedience of the citizens now in the catholike church all beleeuers are citizens ephesians and they yeild voluntarie obedience and subiection to christ their king psalm isai lastly as in ierusalem the names of the citizens were inrolled in a register so the names of all the members of the catholike church are inrolled in the booke of life reu hebr againe the catholike church dwelling here belowe is said to be aboue in heauen for two causes first in respect of her beginning which is from the election and grace of god and from christ the mediatour of whose flesh and bone we are that beleeue ephesians the iustice whereby we are iustified is in christ our holinesse and life flowes from the holinesse and life of christ as from a roote secondly the church is said to be aboue because it dwels by faith in heauen with christ for the propertie of faith is to make vs present after a sort when we are absent heb the vse this beeing so we are admonished to liue in this world as pilgrimes and strangers pet and therefore we must not set our loue vpon any earthly thing but our mindes must be vpon the country to which we are trauelling and whatsoeuer is an hinderance to vs in our iourney we must cast it from vs that we may goe lightly and if we haue any wrongs done vs either in goods or good name we must the rather be content because we are out of our country in a strange place and hereupon we must take occasion to make haste to our iourneys end that is to our own citie and last abode thus did the patriarches heb secondly we must carrie our selues as burgesses of heauen philipp and this we shall do by minding seeking affecting of heauenly things by speaking the language of canaan which is to inuocate and praise the name of god lastly by leading a spirituall life that may beseeme the citizens of heauen many faile in this point when they come to the lord table they professe themselues to be citizens of the citie of god but in their common dealings in the world they play the starke rebels against god and his word and liue according to the lusts of their blinde and vnrepentant hearts thirdly when paul saith that ierusalem which is aboue is free ampc he shewes that the catholike church is one in number amp no more cant my doue is aboue and the onely daughter of her mother ioh one sheepefold there be many members but one bodie corinthian fourthly hence we gather that the catholike church is invisible for the company of them that dwell in heauen by their faith cannot be discerned by the eie john saw the heauenly ierusalem descending from heauen yet not with the bodily eye but in spirit revelation the things which make the catholike church to be the church namely election vocation iustification glorification are inuisible the papist therfore erreth when he teacheth that the catholike church is a visible company vnder one pastour namely the pope and the places which they bring to prooue the visibilitie of the vniuersall church concerne either particular churches or the churches which were in the daies of the apostles or againe they speake of the inward glorie and beautie of the church free that is redeemed from the bondage of death and sin and so from the curse of the lawe of this freedome i will speak more afterward the mother of vs all shee is called a mother because the word of god is committed to the keeping of the church which word is seed pet and milke corinthian and strong meat heb and the church as a mother which by the ministery of the said word brings forth children to god amp after they are borne amp brought forth shee feeds them with milke out of her owne breasts which are the scriptures of the olde and newe testament here a great question is to be propounded namely where we shall find this our mother for it is the dutie of all children to haue recourse vnto their mother and to liue vnder her wing the aduocates of the popish church priests and iesuits say we must be reconciled to the church and see of rome if we would be of the catholike church to this purpose they vse many motiues i will here propound seauen of them because heretofore they haue bin scattered abroad among vs the first motiue the church of rome hath meanes of sure and certen interpretation tradition councels fathers we haue nothing but the priuate interpretation of luther melancthon caluin ampc answer scripture is both the glosse and the text and the principall meanes of the interpretation of scripture is scripture it selfe and it is a means when places of scripture are expounded by the analogie of faith by the words scope and circumstances of the place and the interpretation which is sutable to all these is sure certen and publike for it is the interpretation of god contrariwise the interpretation which is not agreeable to these though it be from church fathers and councells is vncerten and it is priuate interpretation now this kind of interpretation we allow and therefore it is false that we haue onely priuate interpretations and that all the interpretations of the church of rome are publike secondly i answer that we are able to iustifie our interpretations of scripture for the maine points of religion by the consent of fathers and councells as well as they of the church of rome the second motiue we haue no diuine and infallible authoritie to rest on in matter of religion but they of the church of rome haue ans in the canonicall scriptures of the prophets and apostles there is diuine and infallible authoritie for they are now in the new testament in stead of the liuely voice of god and this authoritie we in our church acknowledge secondly i answer that the church hath no diuine and infallible authoritie distinct from the authoritie of scriptures as the papists teach but onely a ministerie which is to speake in the name of god according to the written word the third motiue we haue no limitations of opinion and affection but they of the church of rome haue i answer first we suffer our selues to be limited for opinion by the analogie of faith and by the written word and so doth not the papist which addes tradition to the scripture and for affection we suffer our selues to be limited by the doctrine of repentance and new obedience secondly i answer that the church of rome vseth false meanes of limitation for it teacheth that for opinion we must captiuate our senses to the determination of the church by beleeuing as the church beleeueth though it be not knowne what the church beleeueth and it limits affection by auricular confession and by canonicall satisfactions meere inuentions of man the fourth motiue the romane religion drawes the multitude ans it drawes them indeede because it is a naturall religion but it doth not turne them from darknes to light from death to life secodly i answer that antichrist in his comming shall draw the multitude thess the fift motiue there were neuer but two alterations of religion one in the daies of elijah the other in the daies of john the baptist ans i will shew a third paul saith that before the ende there shall be a departure thess and this departure is generall in all nation revelation and after a thousand yeares there shall be the first resurrection revelation and this resurrection is the reuiuing and the restoring of the gospel after long ignorance and superstition the sixt motiue the church of rome hath a iudge to ende controuersies we haue none ans christ is our iudge and the scripture is the voice of this iudge determining all things pertaining to saluation fully and plainly to the contentation of any conscience the seauenth motiue the romane religion is sutable to ancient tradition ans it is contrarie for it abolisheth the second commandement touching images and the tenth touching lust and it ouerturneth sundrie articles of faith for it abolisheth one of the natures of christ by the reall presence and his three offices by ioyning partners and associates with him to these seauen i adde three other the eight motiue then is this our ministers they say tooke vnto themselues new callings and consequently that we are but schismatikes ans the offices of the first restorers of the gospel were ordinarie and their vocation to the said offices was ordinary for they were all either priests or schoole doctors it may be saide that they departed from their callings i answer they departed onely from the common abuse of their callings which they restored to their right vse the ninth motiue the church of rome hath true baptisme and therefore it is a true church ans baptisme in the papacie pertaines not to it but to another hidden church in the middest of the papacie as the light in the lanthorne pertaines not to it but to the passenger secondly though the church of rome hold the outward baptisme yet doth it ouerturne the inward which stands in the iustification of a sinner by imputation of the obedience of christ thirdly baptisme seuered from the preaching of the gospel is no marke of a church circumcision was vsed in samaria and yet they were no people of god hos the tenth motiue the church of rome hath antiquitie and succession from the apostles ans they are no markes of the church vnlesse they be ioyned with propheticall and apostolicall doctrine the kingdome of darknes hath also antiquitie succession vniuersalitie and vnitie now then we are to hold the church of rome as a stepmother nay as a professed harlot shee is no mother of ours for the lord saith come out of her my people revelation let vs therefore come to the true answer the catholike church our mother is to be sought for and to be found in the true visible churches the certen markes whereof are three the preaching of the word of god out of the writings of the prophets and apostles with obedience ioh ephesians true inuocation of god the father in the onely name of christ by the assistance of the spirit act corinthian the right vse of the sacraments baptisme and the lord supper math and by these shall we finde the true church of god in england ireland scotland germany france ampc againe in that the church is called our mother the papist gathereth that her commandements must be obaied prov and therefore in their catechismes beside the commandements of god they propound the commandements of the church but i answer that the precepts of the father and the mother must be one and then the mother must be obaied the church is called the mother of vs all that is of all true beleeuers hence it follows that wicked man are not members of the catholike church as popish doctors erroniously teach for then the church shall be a mother not onely to the children of god but also to the children of the deuill lastly in that the church is our mother we are taught that we must despise our first birth and seeke to be borne againe vnto god and sucke the brest of our mother feeding on the milke of the word psalm pet thus to be borne a member of the new ierusalem is a great priuiledge psalm revelation for it is written reioyce thou barren that bearest no childre breake forth and crie thou that trauelest not for the desolate hath many more children then shee which hath an husband these words are the testimonie of the prophet isa c and they are brought to prooue that which paul said in the former verse that the catholike church is the mother of vs all that is not onely of the iewes but also of all beleeuing gentiles in the words i consider the preface to the testimonie and the testimonie it selfe the preface it is written where two points are to be considered the first is who saith jt is written ans the apostle paul whose authoritie was diuine and infallible because he was led into all truth by the spirit of god so as he could not erre in deliuering doctrine to the church and yet for all this he followes the rule of the written word and his manner was so to doe act this shewes the shamelesse impudencie of the church of rome which takes to it selfe an absolute power of iudgement in all matters without and beside the scripture yes a power to iudge of the scripture it selfe and of the sense thereof without the helpe of scripture vpon a supposed infallible assistance of the spirit the second point is in what question saith paul it is written ans in a controuersie betweene him and the false apostles touching the iustification of a sinner this shewes that the scripture it selfe is the meanes to determine and decide controuersies there was for this purpose in the old testament the liuely voice of god vttered in the oracle at the mercie seat but in the new testament there is no such voice of god but the written word is in stead thereof to the ende of the world and therefore paul saith it is written in the testimonie i consider three things the condition of two churches the change of the condition the ioy that is vpon the change the condition of the church of the new testament in these words barren that bearest no children thou that trauelest not the desolate barren the christian church is so called because by the vertue and strength of nature it beares no children to god no more then sara did to abraham ioh corinthian secondly it is so called in respect of the beginning thereof when the iewish church was yet standing till the spirit of god was powred forth vpon all flesh after the ascension of christ and before this the number of them which were conuerted to god was very small and therefore christ himselfe complained that he spent his strength in vaine isai thirdly it is so called in respect of the latter times of the church in which christ shall scarce finde faith vpon the earth luke further that the church is barren it is declared by the signe because she neither brings forth child nor beares desolate that is without husband in appearance by reason of the crosse and affliction and without children because at the first the christian church was constrained to hide herselfe in the wildernesse revelation it may be demanded howe the catholike church should be desolate answer the estate of the church is twofold inward or outward the inward estate stands in the true knowledge of god in christ in comfort touching remission of sinnes and life euerlasting in the hearing of our praiers in protection and deliuerance from all spirituall enemy in the gifts of the spirit faith hope loue ampc in respect of this estate the church is all glorious within and neuer desolate psalm the outward estate of the catholike church stands in visible assemblies in the publike ministerie of the word and sacraments in a gouernment according to the word of god in respect of this second estate the church may be in desolation this was the condition of the church in paradise vpon the fall of our first parents of the israelites at mount horeb when they worshipped the golden calfe and in the daies of elijah rom and afterward chronicle when christ suffered the sheapheard was smitten and the sheepe were scattered after christs ascension all the earth worshipped the beast reu hence it followes that the catholike church is not a visible estate or company of man vnder one visible head because in respect of her outward estate shee may be for a time in desolation and as this is the estate of the church so is it also of the mebers thereof they shall be hated of all man luke man shall thinke they doe god good seruice when they kill them ioh and christ himselfe was a man without forme or beautie isai hauing an husband in these wordes the condition of the iewish church is set forth that shee is married or espoused to god who is her husband ezech ose the like may be said of any other church and namely of the church of england the vse this must teach vs to dedicate our body and soules to god and christ and to giue the maine affections of our hearts vnto him as our loue and our ioy ampc secondly we must adorne and trimme our selues with grace that we may please our husband psalm thirdly we must be the glory of christ as the wife is to her husband corinthian and that is by subiecting our selues to christ and his lawes againe if we be roath our selues to christ indeed we may assure our selues that christ is our christ and that he hath giuen himselfe vnto vs and consequently that he will sanctifie vs ezech protect vs as an husband doeth his wife gen and indowe vs with all things needfull for this life and the life to come ezech the second point is the change of the church of the newe testament because shee shall cease to be barren and bring forth many children this is the promise of god and hereupon paul concludes that the church is a mother of all beleeuers both iewes and gentiles obserue that the promise of god is of infinite vertue in his time and place in the beginning god said let there be this or that and it was so of like vertue is god promise if we can waite his leisure god promised that after yeares the israelites should be deliuered out of egypt presently when the time was expired nothing could hinder the promise read exod therefore our dutie is to rest on god promises in all times both in life and death the third point is the ioy vpon the change reioyce here are two things to be considered the first who must reioyce answer the church god kingdome is the place of ioy rom reioycing belongs to the people of god psalm amp the musicke of the temple was typicall and figured the ioy of the catholike church where is the assurance of remission of sinnes and life eternall the second point is in what must the church reioyce ans in the redemption of christ and the fruit thereof the conuersion of sinners to god for the prophet had shewed at large the passion and sufferings of christ isai and hereupon he saith reioyce thou barren the israelites were commanded to feast and to be merrie before the lord leuit chronicle that is before the lord arke which was the pledge of his presence now this arke was a figure of christ and the myrth before the arke signified that the foundation of all our ioy lies in our reconciliation with god in christ the angels in heauen greatly reioyce at the conuersion of a sinner and at the returne of the prodigall son the fat calfe is killed the vse it is false that religion breeds melancholie and cuts of all mirth it doeth not abolish mirth but rectifie it nay it brings man to true and perfect ioy our first and principall ioy must be that we are in god fauour reconciled to god by christ luke in dauid the head of his ioy was the good estate of the church psalm and all other pettie ioyes must flow from this and be sutable to it breake forth this signifies that the church vpon earth is as it were pent in with present greife our ioy in this life is mixed with sorrow the paschall lambe was eaten with sowre hearbes to signifie that we feele no sweetnesse in the blood of christ till we feele the smart of our sinnes we here must reioyce in trembling psalm ioy is sowne for them that are vpright in heart psalm crie in our earthly ioyes we must be moderate and sparing we must not eate to much hony least we surfet yet in spirituall ioyes the measure is to reioice without measure if we be rauished with ioy in christ that we crie againe it is the best of all therefore brother we are after the manner of isaac children of the promise here paul shewes that as sara figured the catholike church so isaac was a figure of all true beleeuers the children of god therefore or thus and we brother we not onely the iewes but also beleeuing gentiles promise the promise made to abraham i will be thy god and the god of thy seed or the promise made to the church that beeing barren shee shall beare many children children of promise beleeuers are so called not because they beleeue the promise though that be a truth but because they are made children of god by the vertue of god promise for thus was isaac the child of promise in that he was borne to abraham not by the strength of nature but by god promise and paul opposeth the children of the promise to the children of the flesh which were borne by naturall strength rom hence it followes that the meere grace of god is the cause of our election and adoption and not any thing in vs for the promise of god makes vs god children and the promise is of the meere grace of god and therefore we are god children by the meere grace of god for the cause of the cause is the cause of the thing caused therefore paul saith that the ephesians were predestinate to adoption ephesians and he saith the that neuer bowed knee to baal were reserued by the election of grace rom and it is a false position to teach that election and adoption are according to god foreknowledge of our faith and obedience for thus shall we elect our selues and be children not of god promise but of our own freewill and faith moreouer god foresees our future faith and obedience because he first decreed to giue the grace of faith vnto vs because the foreknowledge of things which are to come to passe depends vpon a precedent will in god marke further the children of god are called the children of the promise and this promise is absolute and effectual here a question may be resolued and that it whether the child of god in his conuersion haue a libertie and power to resist the inward calling of god answer no the absolute will of god cannot be resisted nowe the promise whereby man are made the children of god is the absolute will of god againe with this promise is ioyned the infinite power of god which without all resistance brings that to passe which god hath promised for he makes man to doe that which he commands ezec he giues the will and the deede philipp so as man effectually called cannot but come ioh it may be saide that this is to abolish all freedome of will ans it sufficeth to the libertie of the will that it be free from compulsion for constraint takes away the libertie of the will and not necessitie secondly the determination of mans will by the will of god is the libertie of the will and not the bondage thereof for this is perfect libertie when mans wil is conformable to the will of god but as he which was borne according to the flesh persecuted him that was borne after the spirit so is it now these wordes are an answer to an obiection on this manner we are hated of the iewes and therefore we are not the children of promise the answer is two fold one in this verse thus no maruell this is the old fashion it was thus in abrahams familie for ismael borne after the flesh persecuted isaac borne after the spirit and so it is at this day obserue that there is a perpetuall enmitie and opposition betweene true beleeuers and hypocrites god put enmitie betweene the seede of the serpent and the seede of the woman gen the world hates them that are chosen out of the world ioh carnall man cannot abide that their opinions and doings should be iudged and condemned of others ioh and hence comes the opposition that is betweene beleeuers and hypocrites who cannot abide such as are not like themselues this hatred and opposition shewes it selfe in persecution of which three things are to be considered the first is who persecutes ans carnall ismaelites such as are of the same religion and familie with isaac thus the iewes persecuted their owne prophets and the thessalonians were persecuted of their own prophets thes thus priests and iesuits that haue bin hertofore borne baptised amp brought vp among vs are the causes of many seditions conspiracies and seeke the subue sion of church and land the second is who are persecuted ans spirituall man the children of the promise they suffer wrong but they doe none in the mount of the lord there is no hurt done isa they turne their speares and swords into mattocks and sithes isa and they which doe no wrong but are content to suffer wrong and that for a good cause are in this respect blessed matth the third point is touching the kind of persecution and that was skorning or mocking gen it may be demanded how mocking can be persecution ans mocking and derision which riseth of the hatred and contempt of our brother is a degree of murder he which saith raca to his brother is guiltie of a councell matth here raca signifieth all signes and gestures that expresse contempt as snuffing tushing iering gerning ampc cain is rebuked of god euen for the casting downe of his countenance gen againe the mocking wherewith ismael mocked isaac proceeded from a contemp and hatred of the grace of god in isaac which paul notes when he saith that he was persecuted which was borne after the spirit this hatred of god grace in man is the beginning of all persecution and the deriding of the grace of god is as much as the spoiling of our goods and the seeking of our liues thus cain hated his brother by reason of the grace of god because his deedes were good ioh a great part of the sufferings of christ stood in this that he was mocked for his confidence in god psalm matthew the children of bethel mocke elizeus first for his person calling him bald pate secondly for the fauour of god shewed vpon elijah his master in saying ascend bald ate that is us in in q st ascend not to bethel but ascend to heauen as elijah did and this prophane skorning he cursed in the name of god king the like skorning is vsed among vs at this day for the practise of that religion which stands by the law of god and the good lawes of this land is nicknamed with tearmes of precis nes and puritie a thing much to be lamented for this bewraies that there is a great want of the grace of god among s therefore take heede of it but what saith the scripture put out the bond woman and her son for the son of the bondwoman shal not be heire with the son of the freewoman the second answer to the former obiection is in these wordes that they which hate the children of promise shall at length be cast out of the house of god obiect i these wordes cast out the bondwoman are the words of sara to abraham therefore they are not the words of scripture ans the words were vttered by sara but they were afterward approoued by god gen and thus they are the voice of scripture obiect ii sara is commended for her subiection to abraham pet yet here shee speakes imperiously cast out the bondwoman ans shee speakes this not as a priuate woman but as the voice and mouth of god and that no doubt by instinct from god and therefore the words shee vttereth are to be esteemed as the commandement of god this her case is extraordinarie and not to be followed thevse i all carnall hypo ites mockers of the grace of god shall be cast forth of god familie though for a time they beare a sway therein this is the sentence of god let vs therefore repent of our mocking and hereafter become louers of the grace of god as christ was mark ii consolation the persecution of the people of god shall not be perpetuall for the persecuting bondwoman and her son must be cast out the rodde of the wicked shall no rest vpon the lot of the righteous psalm this is our comfort iii all iustitiarie people and persons that looke to be saued and iust fied before god by the law and the workes of the law either in whole or in part are cast out of the church of god and haue no part in the kingdome of heauen the casting out of agar and ismael is a figure of the reiection of all such behold here the voice of god casting downe from heauen the greatest part of the earth the turke the iew the obstinate papist with the stepmother the roman church then brother we are not children of the servant but of the freewoman the conclusion of the whole argument following directly from the verse if we be children of the promise then are we children of the freewoman and not of the bondwoman amp consequently we are iustified and saued without the works of the law by the meere grace of god causing vs by faith to rest on the promise of god whose substance and foundation is christ stand fast therefore in the libertie wherewith christ hath made vs free and be not intangled againe with the yoke of bondage these words are repetition of the principall conclusion of the whole epistle which was on this manner i paul am called to teach and my doctrine is true therefore ye did euill to depart from it and your dutie was to haue stood vnto it further they are collected and inferred vpon the conclusion of the last argument vsed in the last chapter thus ye are children of the freewoman and therefore ye are free and therefore ye should hold fast your libertie in the words two maine points of doctrine are propounded the first is that by nature we are all intangled with the yoke of bondage for the better conceiuing of this i will handle three points the nature of this bondage the signe of it and the vse touching the nature of it our spirituall bondage stands in three things the first is bondage vnder sinne which paul teacheth when he saith i am carnall sold vnder sinne rom here remember that by sinne is meant originall sinne which hath two parts guiltines in the first offence of adam which is imputed to all mankind and the disposition of all the powers of the soule to all manner of euill whatsoeuer and this rebellious disposition is like a leprosie infecting the whole man and it raignes like a tyrant ouer the soule of man by tempting intising and drawing him from one actuall sinne to another so as he can doe nothing but sinne iam the second thing is obligation or subiection to all punis ment both temporall and eternall and it hath three parts the first is bondage vnder satan who keepes vnrepentant sinners in his snare according to his owne will tim he rules in their hearts like a god corinthian and hath power to blinde them and to harden their hearts till he haue brought them to eternall death heb the second is bondage vnder an euill conscience which sits in the hearts of offendours as an accuser and a terrible iudge and lies like a wild beast at a mans dore readie euer and anon to plucke out his throat gen the third is bondage vnder the wrath of god and the feare of eternall death heb the third part of this bondage is the obligation to the ceremoniall law it pertaines not to all mankind but onely concernes the iewes to whome it was a yoke of bondage act the signe of this bondage whereby it may be discerned is to keepe a course or practise in sinning ioh he that commits sinne is a servant of sinne or againe a life led according to the custome and fashion of this world in the lust of the flesh or the lust of the eye which is couetousnes or in the pride of life ephesians ioh the vse we must learne to see feele acknowledge and bewaile this bondage in our selues deliuerance belongs onely to such captiues as know themselues to be captiues luke and labour vnder this bondage matth thus did paul when he saith i am sold vnder sinne and o miserable man who shall deliuer me from this bodie of death to feele this bondage is a steppe out of it and not to feele it is to be plunged into it secondly we must pray earnestly for deliuerance the dumme creatures sigh and trauell till they be deliuered from their bondage much more then must we doe it rom thirdly we must learne to detest whatsoeuer is of our selues because it wholly tends to bondage lastly we must be content with any affliction that god laies on vs though it be lingring sicknes pouertie imprisonment banishment for god might worthely lay on vs all shame and confusion because we are by nature slaues of sinne and satan the second maine doctrine is that by grace there is a libertie pertaining to the people of god here i consider foure things what this libertie is the author of it the persons to whome it belongs our dutie touching this libertie for the first christian libertie is called the good or commoditie of christians rom it is a spirituall right or condition lost by adam and restored by christ i say spirituall because it pertaines to the conscience the vse indeede of our libertie is in outward things as meate drinke apparell ampc but the libertie it selfe is in the conscience and thus it differs from ciuill libertie which stands in the moouing of the bodie in the choise of bodily actions and in the free vse of our goods christian libertie hath two parts a deliuerance from miserie and freedome in good things deliuerance hath foure parts the first is a deliuerance from the curse of the law for the breach thereof rom there is no condemnation to them that are in christ and this comes to passe because there is a translation made of the curse from our persons to the person of christ gal the second deliuerance is from the obligation of the law whereby it binds vs to bring perfect righteousnes in our owne persons for the attainment of euerlasting life according to the tenour thereof doe this and liue and this deliuerance is procured because there is a translation made of the fulfilling of the law from our persons to the person of our sauiour christ from these two deliuerances ariseth the pacification of the conscience partly for our iustification and partly for our conuersation touching iustification a sinner in his humiliation and conuersion hath by this doctrine a libertie without respect to his owne workes or to his owne fulfilling of the law to rest on the meere mercie of god for the forgiuenes of his sinnes and the saluation of his soule and to appeale from the throne of diuine iustice to the throne of grace and to oppose the merit of christ against the wrath and iudgement of god and this hath bin alwaies the helpe of the godly in their distresse read chronicle ezra daniel psalm consider the example of the publican and the prodigall son who condemne themselues and make their appeale to the court of mercie and grace here some man may say how shall i know that i am freed from the rigour of the law and from the curse thereof ans thou must first set thy selfe at the barre of god iudgement and there must thou arraigne accuse and condemne thy selfe this done thou must vse thy libertie and make thine appeale to god mercie and grace for pardon by asking seeking knocking and thus at length shalt thou be resolued touching thy deliuerance moreouer touching conuersation our consciences are setled thus in that we are freed from the rigour of the law god in mercie accepts the will and indeauour to beleeue repent and obay for faith repentance and obedience he spares them that feare him as a father spares his child when he indeauours to doe that which he can mal the law requires perfect obedience at our hands yet god of his mercie lookes more at the will to obay then the perfection of obedience this must be a stay to our mindes when we see more corruption then grace in our selues and our obedience tainted with many spots of disobedience the third deliuerance is from the obseruation of the ceremoniall law of moses column and hence ariseth an other deliuerance from the bondage of humane traditions as paul saith if yee be dead with christ from the elements of the world why are ye burdened with traditions column the fourth deliuerance is from vnder the tyrannie and dominion of sinne rom let not sinne haue dominion ouer you for ye are not vnder the law but vnder grace in the first tonuersion of a sinner originall sinne receiues his deadly wound and the dominion thereof is diminished according to the measure of grace receiued the second part of christian libertie is a freedome in good things and it is fourefold the first is a freedome in the voluntarie seruice of god luke we are deliuered from our enemy that we may serue god in righteousnes and holines before him all the daies of our liues without feare paul saith that the law is not giuen to the righteous man tim because he is a law to himselfe and freely does good duties as if there were no law to bind him the cause of this freedome is the gift and donation of the free spirit of god therefore dauid praies stablish me with thy free spirit psalm and paul saith where the spirit is there is libertie corinthian and the spirit of life which is in christ is a law to vs and frees vs from the power of sinne and death rom it may be obiected that this freedome in the voluntarie seruice of god is bondage for christ saith matth take my yoke vpon you and we are as straightly bound to the obedience of the law of god as adam was by creation nay more straightly by reason of our redemption by christ ans the more we are bound to obedience the freer we are because the seruice of god is not bondage but perfect libertie the second freedome is in the free vse of all the creatures of god tit to the pure all things are pure rom and the reason is because the dominion ouer the creatures lost by adam is restored by christ corinthian and hence it is that paul calls the forbidding of marriage and of meates with obligation of conscience a doctrine of deuills tim the third freedome is a libertie to come vnto god the father in the name of christ and in praier to be heard rom ephesians whereas according to our naturall condition our sinnes are a wall of partition betweene vs and god and cause vs to flie from the presence of god and though we crie vnto god and fill heauen and earth with our cries so long as we are in our sinnes we are not heard of him the fourth freedome is a libertie to enter into heauen in the day of our death christ by his blood hauing made a way heb thus we see what christian libertie is the vse followes the anabaptists gather hence that among christians there must be magistrates they must haue power to make lawes beside the lawes of god but this power they haue not because christians haue a free vse of all the creatures of god by christian libertie ans we must distinguish betweene the libertie it selfe and the vse of it and the magistrates authoritie deales not with the libertie which is in the conscience but with the vse of it and he doth neither diminish nor abolish the vse of any of the creatures but restraines the abuse and moderates the ouer common vse for the common good thus magistracie and christian libertie may stand together and the rather because libertie is in conscience and the magistrates authoritie pertaines to the bodie here is further comfort for all the godly for euen by christian libertie their consciences are exempted from the power of all creatures man and angels corinthian ye are bought with a prise be not servant of man that is let not your hearts and consciences stand in subiection to the will of any man here then falls to the ground the opinion of the papists namely that the lawes and traditions of the church bind conscience as truly and certenly as the word of god this doctrine is not of god because it is against christian libertie obiect i rom be subiect to the higher powers for conscience ans conscience here is not in respect of the lawes of the magistrate but in respect of the law of god that binds vs in conscience to obay the law of the magistrate obiect ii heb obay them that haue the ouersight of you and be subiect ans we must be subiect to them because as ministers of god they deliuer the word of god in the name of god vnto vs and that word binds conscience againe the lawes which they make touching order and comelines in the seruice of god are to be obaied for the auoiding of scandall and contempt obiect iii a thing indifferent vpon the commandement of the magistrate becomes necessarie ans it is true but it must be obserued that necessitie is twofold externall internall and the law of the magistrate makes a thing indifferent to be necessarie onely in respect of externall necessitie for the auoiding of the contempt of authoritie and for the auoiding of scandall otherwise the thing in it selfe is not necessarie but remaines still indifferent and may be vsed or not vsed if contempt and scandall be auoided the apostles made a law that the gentiles should abstaine from strangled and blood and things offered to idols act yet paul saith afterward to the corinthians all things are lawful corinthian and whatsoeuer is sold in the shambles eate and make no question for conscience sake v because their intent was not that the law should simply binde but onely in the case of offence and therefore where there was no offence to be seared they leaue all man to their libertie againe here is an other comfort to all that beleeue in christ that nothing can hurt them and that no euill can befall them psalm v nay all things shall in the ende turne to their good though in reason and sense they seeme hurtfull to beleeue this one thing is a ground of all true comfort the consideration of this benefit of christian libertie teacheth three duties the first is from our hearts to imbrace loue and maintaine christian religion because it is the meanes of this libertie the second is carefully to search the scriptures for they are as it were the charter in which our liberties are contained thirdly our christian libertie puts vs in minde to become vnfained servant of god in the duties of faith repentance newe obedience rom for this seruice is our libertie the second point is touching the author of this libertie in these words wherewith christ hath made vs free christ then is the worker of this libertie ioh he dissolues the works of the deuill ioh he binds the strong man and casts him out of his hold matth he procures this libertie by two meanes by his merit and by the efficacie of his spirit the merit of his death procures deliuerance from death and it purchaseth a right to life euerlasting the efficacie of his spirit assures vs of our adoption and withall abates by little and little the strength and power of sinne the vse hence we learne the greatnes and grieuousnes of our spirituall bondage because there was none that could deliuer vs from it but christ by his death and passion hence therefore we are to take occasion to acknowledge and bewaile this our most miserable condition in our selues secondly the prise that was paid for the procurement of our libertie namely the pretious blood of the immaculate lambe of god shewes that the libertie it selfe is a thing most pretious and excellent and so to be esteemed thirdly for this libertie we are to giue all praise and thanks to god this did paul at the remembrance of it rom corinthian and not to be thankfull is an height of wickednesse the third point is concerning the persons to whome this libertie belongs and they are noted in these wordes stand ye fast he hath made vs free whereby paul signifies himselfe and the galatians that beleeued in christ beleeuers then are the persons to whome this libertie belongs ioh tim and true beleeuers are thus to be discerned they vse the ordinatiemeanes of grace and saluation the word amp sacraments in the vse of the meanes they exercise themselues in the spirituall exercises of inuocation and repentance and in these exercises they bewaile their vnbeleefe and striue by all meanes to beleeue in christ as for them that conceiue a perswasion of god mercie without the meanes of saluation and without the exercises of inuocation and repentance they are not true beleeuers but hypocrites when paul saith christ hath made vs free that is me paul and you the galatians he teacheth that euery beleeuer must by his faith applie vnto himselfe the benefit of christian libertie but to doe this well is a matter of great difficultie the papists in their writings report our doctrine to be this that a man must conceiue a perswasion that he is in the fauour of god the adopted child of god and that vpon this perswasion he hath the pardon of his sinnes and the benefit of christian libertie but they abuse vs in this as in many other things for we teach that the application of christ and his benefits is to be made by certaine degrees the first is to vse the meanes of saluation the word praier sacraments the second is to consider and to grow to some feeling of our spirituall bondage the third is to will and desire to beleeue in christ and to testifie this desire by asking seeking knocking the fourth is a certen perswasion or a certentie conceiued in minde of the mercie of god by meanes of the former desire according to the promise of god aske and it shall be giuen vnto you the fifth is an experience of the goodnes of god after long vse of the meanes of saluation and then vpon this experience followes the full perswasion of mercie and forgiuenes the fourth point concernes the office of beleeuers and that is to stand fast in their christian libertie and in the doctrine of the gospel which reueales this libertie and by this we in england are admonished to stand fast to the religion which is now by law established amog vs amp not to returne vnder the yoke of popish bondage for the popish religion is flat against christian libertie two waies for our libertie which we haue in christ frees vs from the law three waies in respect of condemnation in respect of compulsion to obedience and in respect of iustification as paul shewes at large in this epistle and yet the popish doctrine is that we are to be iustified by the workes of the law againe christian libertie frees our consciences from the traditions of man column and yet the popish religion bindes vs in conscience to the traditions of man nay it is nothing els but an heape of traditions here two things are to be considered the manner of standing and the time the manner is signified in the very words for to stand fast is to hold and maintaine our libertie with courage and constancie whatsoeuer comes of it as the soldier keepes his standing though it cost him his life we are readie to defend the libertie of our country euen with the hazard of our liues much more then are we to defend christian libertie with the losse of all that we inioy sinne must be resisted euen vnto blood hebr if man be fearefull they must pray to god for the spirit of boldnes and courage and if god vouchsafe not this gift when opportunitie is offered they may withdraw themselues and by flying preserue their libertie the time of standing is the euill day that is the day of triall ephesians and then to stand fast is a matter of great difficultie and for this cause we are before hand to prepare our selues by obseruing these rules following first we must labour that religion be not onely in mind and memorie but also be rooted in the affection of our hearts so as we loue it reioyce in it and esteeme it aboue all things secondly we must not onely be hearers of the word of god but also doers of it in the exercises of faith repentance new obedience thirdly we must ioyne with our religion the soundnes of good conscience for if conscience faile we cannot be sound in our religion lastly we must pray to god with all manner of praier and supplication for all things needefull ephesians behold i paul say vnto you that if ye be circumcised christ shal profit you nothing these words are a reason of the former conclusion thus if ye be circumcised and goe backe from your christian profession christ shall profit you nothing therefore stand fast in the words i consider a sentence and the proofe of it the sentence if ye be circumcised ampc the proofe j paul say vnto you for the better vnderstanding of the sentence circumcision must here be considered according to the circumstance of time three waies before christ it was a sacrament and a seale of the righteousnesse of faith rom after the death of christ till the destruction of the temple it was a dead ceremonie yet sometime vsed as a thing indifferent after the destruction of the temple when the church of the new testament was planted among the gentiles it was a deadly ceremonie and ceased to be indifferent and in this last respect paul saith if ye be circumcised ampc againe circumcision must be considered according to the opinion which the false apostles had of it now they put their confidence in it and made it a meritorious cause of their saluation and ioyned it with christ the words therefore carrie this sense if ye will be circumcised with this opinion that circumcision shall be vnto you a meritorious cause of your saluation christ shall profit you nothing the vse hence it followes that the doctrine of iustification by works is an errour ouerturning the foundation of religion which whosoeuer obstinately maintaineth cannot be saued it will be said this is true of ceremoniall works but not of morall works ans yes euen of morall for that which paul saith here of circumcision he speakes generally of the whole law verse ye are abolished from christ whosoeuer are iustified by the law and circumcision must be considered as an obligation to the obedience of the whole law againe it may be said this is true of the works of nature but not of works of grace ans yes euen of workes of grace for the galatians were regenerate and therfore looked not to be iustified amp saued by the workes of nature but by workes of grace secondly hence we gather that to adde any thing to the passion as a meritorious cause of our iustification and saluation is to make christ vnprofitable for he must be a perfect sauiour or no sauiour he admits neither partner nor deputy in the worke of our redemption and the grace of god admits no mixture or composition with any thing that is of vs grace is no grace vnlesse it be freely giuen euery way therefore the popish religio is a damnable religion because with the merit amp satisfactio of christ it ioyns humane merits amp satisfactions in the case of our iustification it may be alleadged that the popish religion maintaines all the articles concerning christ as we doe ans it doth so in word but withall it addes to the foresaid articles the doctrine of humane merits and satisfactions which make voide the death of christ againe papists alleadge that it is the glorie of christ that he merits for vs and withall makes vs to merit for our selues as it is the glorie of an emperour to make other kings vnder him ans it is not the glorie of the emperour to make kings as partners with him in his kingdome and workes set vp as meritorious causes of saluation dishonour christ for they make him vnprofitable as paul here teacheth popish religion therefore is in no wise in any place to be tollerated where it may be abolished but it is to be wished that it were banished forth of towne and countrey and students are to be warned with great circumspection to read popish writers for no good can be looked for of that religion that makes christ vnprofitable lastly we are here taught to content our selues with christ alone and with his works merits and satisfactions for in him we are complete column the confirmation of the sentence followeth i paul say it therfore it is so this kind of reasoning may not seeme strange for the apostles in writing and preaching had the diuine and infallible assistance of the spirit so as they could not erre this must be held as a principle in religion and beeing denied there is no certentie of the bible for i testifie againe to euery man that is circumcised that he is bound to keepe the whole law ye are abolished from christ whosoeuer are iustified by the law ye are fallen from grace the meaning paul saith i testifie againe because he hath spoken thus much in effect before gal that is circumcised who is of opinion of the false apostles that will be circumcised and looke for iustification thereby bound to the whole law that is to the whole ceremoniall law to the iudiciall law and to the whole morall law and further bound in respect of iustification and life to doe all things in the law for he that will be iustified by one act of the law is bound to performe the rest for his iustification abolished from christ that is christ is become an idle and emptie christ vnto you whosoeuer are iustified by the law that is are of opinion that they are to be iustified by the workes of the law for indeede a sinner cannot be iustified by the law but onely in his owne false opinion grace that is the loue and fauour of god the resolution the third verse is a confirmation of the reason in the second verse and it may be framed thus he which is bound to keepe the whole law hath no part in christ he which is circumcised is bound to keepe the whole law therefore he which is circumcised hath no part in christ the verse is a repetition of the second verse with a declaration therof for he shewes what he meanes by circumcision namely iustification by circumcision and consequently by the whole law and therefore when he had said if ye be circumcised he changeth his speach saying whosoeuer is iustified by the law againe least man might thinke it a small matter to be abolished from christ he shewes that it is indeede to fall from grace the vse these verses are as it were a thunderbolt against all popery and first of all i vrge the argument of paul against the popish church and against the popish religion if ye be iustified by the law ye are abolished from christ and fallen from christ answer is made that the words are to be vnderstood of such workes of the law as are from nature and goe before faith and not of such workes as are from grace and follow faith for such workes they say are from christ and stand with him i answer the words of paul are to be vnderstood of all workes of the law whether they be from nature or from grace for this epistle of paul was written about sixe yeares after the conuersion of the galatians therefore they were and had bin long regenerate persons now man regenerate looke not to be iustified by works of nature but by good workes which are workes of grace and paul saith ephesians we are not saued by workes which god hath ordained that we should walke in and these are the best workes that are or can be againe tit of his mercie he saued vs and not of workes of righteousnes by this text we further see that we and the papists differ not about circumstances vnlesse grace and christ be circumstances againe we see that the church of rome is indeede no church because by maintaining iustification by works it is abolished from christ and fallen from grace againe i vrge pauls argument against them on this manner he which is debter to the whole law hath no part in christ he which is iustified by workes is debter to the whole law therefore he which is iustified by workes hath no part in christ let them answer if they can i turne the same argument another way thus he which is iustified by workes is bound to keepe the whole law but no man can keepe the whole law therefore no man can be iustified by workes they answer to the minor by making a double fulfilling of the law one for this life the other for the life to come and both in their kind perfect the fulfilling of the law for the time of this life they say it is to loue god aboue all creatues in truth and that he which doth thus much fulfills the law and is no offender hereupon they inferre that works may be answerable to the law and be opposed to the iudgement of god and for this doctrine they alleadge s augustine i answer againe that paul in this place takes it for a confessed truth that no man can fulfill the law and he vrgeth it as a great inconuenience that any man should be bound to keepe the whole law and before he hath said he which is of the workes of the law is cursed gal which could not be if there were a fulfilling of the law for the time of this life as for augustine it is true he makes two fulfillings of the law and one of them for the time of this life but this he saith is imperfect and this imperfection he makes to be a sinne whereas the papists of our time teach that man may fulfill the law for the time of this life without sinne where paul saith if ye be circumcised marke how the false apostles abuse circumcision it is by diuine institution a seale of the righteousnes of faith and they make it a meritorious cause of saluation it is indeede rather god worke then our worke and they make it their owne worke and that meritorious before god like doe the papists at this day baptisme is a signe and seale of god mercie by diuine institution and they turne it into a physicall cause which containes and conferres grace in like sort they turne the workes of the spirit almes praier fasting contrition yes their owne traditions confession satisfaction and such like into meritorious causes of iustification and life and this is the fashion of deceiuers to retaine the names of holy things but not to retaine the right vse of them as here we see circumcision was an obligation to the keeping of the whole law in the old testament so is baptisme in the new an obligation or bond whereby we haue bound our selues to liue according to all the lawes of god matth this discouers the atheisme and vnbeleefe of persons baptised in these our daies for few there be that thinke vpon and performe this obligation we are further to obserue the condition of the law it is wholly copulatiue all the parts of it are linked one to another he that is bound to one commandement is bound to all he that keepes one indeede keepes all he that breakes one in respect of the disposition of his heart is a breaker of all iam he that makes no conscience to keepe some one commandement if occasion be offered will breake any hence it followes that true regeneration is that which is a reformation and change according to the whole law of god and containes in it the seedes of all good duties christ saith he that is washed is all cleane ioh iosias turned to god according to the whole law zachary and elizabeth walke in all the commandements of god without reproofe luke dauid saith he shall not be confounded when he hath respect to all the commandements of god psalm on the contrarie he which hath many excellent things in him if he liue in the manifest breach of some one commandement is sound in none nay indeede he is guiltie of all herod did many good things and yet all was nothing because he liued in incest mark the deuill is able to bring a man to perdition as well by one sinne as by many whereas paul saith if ye be iustified by the law ye are abolished from christ first i gather that the law and the gospel are not one in substance of doctrine as the papists teach for they say the gospel is nothing but the law made more perfect and plaine which if it were true a man might be iustified both by christ and the law which paul saith cannot be secondly i gather hence that it is a meere deuice of mans wit to say that christ by his death and passion merited that we should merit by our owne workes our iustification and saluation for if this were true that the merit of our workes were the fruit of christs passion paul would not haue said that iustification by the law should abolish christ vnto vs for the cause and the effect both stand together whereas christs merit and the merit of our works agree euen as fire and water and no maruell for the reason why christ meriteth is the personall vnion of the godhead with the manhood which vnion because it is not to be found in any meere man neither is there any true and proper merit to be found whereas paul saith ye are fallen from grace some gather that the children of god may fall quite from the fauour of god ans man are said to be vnder grace two waies first in the iudgement of infallibilitie and thus onely the elect are vnder the grace of god secondly in the iudgement of christian charitie and thus all that professe christ though indeede hypocrites are vnder the grace of god and in this sense paul saith that the whole church of galatia is vnder the grace of god and they are said to fall from grace not because all were indeede vnder the fauour of god and at length cast out of it but because god makes it manifest to man that they were neuer in the fauour of god thus christs enemy are said o be blotted out of the booke of lif psalm when god makes it manifest that their names were neuer written there secondly i answer that paul speakes this not absolutely but vpon condition if ye will be iustified by the law and therefore v he saith that he is perswaded better things of them lastly here we see it is false that euery man shall be saued by his religion for he that is abolished from christ is quite out of the auour of god and therefore no religion but that which is truly christian saueth for we in the spirit by faith waite for the hope of righteousnes for in iesus christ neither circumcision nor vncircumcision auaileth any thing but faith which worketh by loue the meaning we i paul the rest of the apostles and all other christian churches in spirit that is in the powers of the soule sanctified and renewed in this sense paul saith that the true circumcision is that which is in the heart in spirit rom and christ saith that true worship of god is in spirit ioh and that spirit is here taken in this sense it is manifest because it is opposed to circumcision which is in the flesh by faith we wait faith apprehends the promise and thereby brings forth hope and faith by meanes of hope makes them that beleeue to waite hope of righteousnes that is saluation or life eternall which is the fruit of righteousnes tit or againe righteousnes hoped for righteousnes indeede is imputed to them that beleeue and that in this life yet the fruition and the full reuelation thereof is reserued to the life to come when christ our righteousnes shall appeare and when the effect of righteousnes namely sanctification shall be accomplished in vs rom ioh the sense then is this all the apostles and christian churches with one consent in spirit by meanes of their faith waite for the full reuelation of their imputed righteousnes and for euerlasting life whereas the false apostles place their righteousnes in circumcision of the flesh and looke to haue the fruition of it in this life v in christ that is in the church kingdome or religion of christ corinthian if any be in christ that is if any be a christian he is a new creature vncircumcision that is the condition and workes of man vncircumcised auaileth any thing is of no vse respect or acceptation with god faith working faith effectuall in duties of loue the resolution these wordes containe a second reason where paul confirmes the former conclusion and it may be framed thus that thing which makes vs waite for the hope of righteousnes that iustifies not circumcision but faith makes vs waite for the hope of righteousnes therefore not circumcision but faith iustifies the proposition is omitted the minor is in the verse and it is confirmed by two arguments the first is the consent of all churches we waite the second is taken from the propertie of faith in the sixt verse thus it is faith and not circumcision that auailes before god therefore faith and not circumcision makes vs waite againe in these two verses paul meetes with an obiection which may be framed thus if ye abolish circumcision and the ceremoniall law ye abolish the exercises of religion the answer is in stead of them we haue other exercises in our spirit namely the inward exercises of faith hope and loue the vse in the verse foure things are to be considered the first is who waites paul saith we waite before he hath iustified his doctrine by the scriptures now he addes the consent of the churches here then we see what is the office of all faithfull dispensers of the word namely to declare such doctrines as are founded in scriptures and approoued by the consent of the true church of god paul an apostle that could not erre respected consent much more are all ordinarie ministers to doe it againe it is the office of all christian people to maintaine and defend all such doctrines and opinions as are founded in the scriptures and ratified by the consent of the true churches of god and no other this to doe is to walke in the way of vnitie and peace and to doe otherwise is to walke in the way of schisme and heresie the second point is what is waited for paul saith the reuelation of righteousnes and eternall saluation here i obserue that there is no iustification by the obseruation of the law and i prooue it thus the righteousnes whereby a sinner is iustified is apprehended by faith and expected by hope but if righteousnes were by the law man should haue the fruition of their righteousnes in this life and consequently the hope thereof should cease secondly here is comfort for the godly they complaine of the want of sanctification but they are to know that in this life they shall neuer feele righteousnes as they feele sinne here they must hunger and thirst after righteousnes liuing in some want of it if we haue the first fruits of the spirit the hatred of our owne sinne the purpose of not sinning the feare of god and such like we must content our selues and waite for the fruition of further grace till the life to come thirdly we must become waiters for the mercie of god and for life euerlasting gen iud v for this cause we must doe as they doe which waite amp attend for some great benefit we must daily stand with our supplications knocking at the mercie gate to the death and we must daily prepare our selues against the day of death and it must be welcome vnto vs for then is the ende of all our waiting and attending the third point is by what are we to waite paul saith we waite by faith hence it followes that faith brings with it a speciall certentie of the mercie of god and of life euerlasting for man vse not to waite for the things whereof they are vncerten waiting presupposeth certentie the papists therefore that make speciall hope should also make speciall faith the last point is where is this waiting paul saith in spirit here obserue that all the exercises of christian religion are to be in the spirit god must be worshipped in spirit ioh rom the heart must be rent and not the garment io l the inward motions of the spirit are of themselues the worship of god whereas our words and deedes are not simply but so farforth as they are founded in the renewed motions of the heart man in our daies thinke they doe god high seruice if they come to church heare god word and say some few praiers indeede these things are not to be condemned yet are they not sufficient vnlesse withall we bring vnto god a renewed spirit indued with faith hope oue in the verse paul propounds three conclusions the first is this that externall and bodely priuiledges are of no vse and moment in the kingdome of christ paul saith tim bodily exercise profiteth little and that godlines is profitable for all things it was a great priuiledge to be familiarly acquainted with christ and to haue eaten and drunke with him yet is it of no vse in the kingdome of christ for of such christ saith luke depart from me ye workers of iniquitie it was a great priuiledge to be allied to christ in respect of blood yet in the kingdome of christ it is of no vse and therefore christ saith he that doth the will of my father is my brother sister and mother mark to conceiue and beare christ was a great honour to the virgin marie yet was shee not by this meanes a member of the kingdome of christ but by her faith in him and if shee had not borne him in her heart as well as shee bare him in her wombe shee had not bin saued to prophecie or preach and that in the name of christ is a great dignitie and yet many hauing this prerogatiue shall be condemned matth it may be alleadged that some outward exercises as baptisme and the lord supper are of great vse in the church of christ i answer the outward baptisme is nothing without the inward not the washing of the flesh but the stipulation of a good conscience saueth pet circumcision is profitable if thou keepe the law rom by this we are taught not to esteeme of mens religion by their riches and externall dignities for the fashion of the world is if a man haue riches and honour to commend him for a wise vertuous and godly man this is foolishly to haue faith in respect of persons iam secondly by this we are taught to moderate our affections in respect of all outward things neither sorrowing too much for them nor ioying too much in them corinthian the second conclusion faith is of great vse and acceptation in the kingdome of christ by it first our persons and then our actions please god and without it nothing pleaseth god it is the first and the greatest honour we can doe to god to giue credence to his word and from this flowes all other obedience to all other commandements hence we learne first that we must labour to conceiue faith a right in our hearts by the vse of the right meanes the word praier sacraments as also in and by the exercises of spirituall inuocation and repentance this beeing done we must rest vpon the bare word and testimonie of god without and against sense and feeling and quiet our hearts therein both in life and death secondly faith in christ must raigne and beare sway in our hearts and haue the command ouer reason will affection lust and by it whatsoeuer we doe or suffer specially the maine actions of our liues are to be ordered and disposed lastly it is a thing to be bewailed that the common faith of our daies is but a ceremoniall faith conceiued without the ordinarie meanes and seuered from the exercises of inuocation and repentance the third conclusion is that true faith workes by loue hence the papists gather that loue is the forme and life of faith not because it makes faith to be faith but because it makes it to be a true faith a good faith a liuely faith but this their doctrine is false and erronious for faith is the cause of loue and loue is the fruit of faith tim loue out of a pure heart good conscience and faith vnfained now euery cause as it is a cause hath his force and efficacie in it selfe and receiues no force or efficacie from his effect secondly true faith is liuely and effectuall in it selfe and hath a peculiar forme of his owne and that is a certen power to apprehend christ in the promise for in faith there are two things knowledge and apprehension which some call application or speciall affiance which affiance because the papists cut off they are constrained to make a supplie by loue thirdly the operation of faith according to the doctrine of the papist is to prepare and dispose a sinner to his future iustification now if this operation be from loue then loue is before iustification and that cannot be because as they teach iustification stands in loue loue therfore is not the forme of faith they alleadge for themselues this very text in hand where it is said faith worketh by loue or as they translate it faith is acted and mooued by loue ans the meaning of the text is that faith is effectuall in it selfe and that it shewes and puts forth his efficacie by loue as by the fruit thereof and it cannot hence be gathered that faith is acted and mooued by loue as by a formall cause againe they alleadge iam as the bodie is dead without the spirit so is faith without workes ans the soule of man is not the forme of his bodie but of the whole man spirit may as well signifie breath or breathing as the soule and so it carries a fit sense for as the bodie without breath is dead and it shewes it selfe to be aliue by breathing so faith that is without workes is dead and it shewes it selfe to be aliue by workes there is a false composition of the wordes to be considered faith that is without workes is dead is true but to say faith is dead without workes as though workes gaue life to faith is false and not the meaning of s iames but the former onely againe the papists hence gather that faith and loue are ioynt causes in the iustification of a sinner and that faith worketh loue in iustifying man before god but this interpretation is against the whole scope of this epistle in which paul prooues that there is no iustification by the law c v and therefore no iustification by loue againe paul saith rom that righteousnes is reuealed without the law and therefore without loue and againe that we are made the righteousnes of christ as christ is made our sinne namely by imputation and therefore not by infusion of loue corinthian thirdly faith iustifies by apprehending christ in the promise and therefore not by loue the consequent i prooue thus faith and loue are two hands of our soule faith is an hand that laies hold of christ and it doth as it were pull him and his benefits into our soules but loue is an hand of another kind for it serues not to receiue in but to giue out the good it hath and to communicate it selfe vnto others therefore faith cannot iustifie by loue lastly loue in order of nature followes iustification and therefore it doth not iustifie for first of all faith laies hold on christ then followes iustification vpon iustification follows sanctification and loue is a part of sanctification they vrge for themselues the words of paul that faith works by loue ans paul doth not shew in this verse what iustifieth but what are the exercises of godlines in which christians must be occupied and he doth not shew how faith iustifieth but how it may be discerned to be true faith namely by loue secondly they obiect that faith and loue are alwaies ioyned and therefore ioyntly worke in iustification ans they are ioyned in one person or subiect and they are ioyned in the exercise of christian life but they are not ioyned in the article of iustification thirdly they vrge the of s iames where it is saide that a man is iustified not onely by faith but also by works v ans faith in s iames is put for an historicall knowledge of religion or for the bare confession and profession of faith againe iustification is twofold one of the person the other of the faith of the person iustification of the person is when a sinner is absolued of his sinnes and accepted to life euerlasting for the merit of christ iustification of the faith of the person is when faith is approoued and found to be true faith and a beleeuer iustifies himselfe to be a true beleeuer of this second iustification speakes s iames and it is not onely by faith but also by workes lastly it may be obiected that loue is of no vse if it doe not iustifie ans iustification and sanctification are two distinct benefits corinthian and iustification ministers vnto vs deliuerance from hell and a right to life euerlasting sanctification is a fruit of the former and serues to make vs thankefull to god for our iustification and loue serues for the same vse because it is a speciall part of sanctification thus much of the deprauation of the text by the papists hence further i gather that many falsely in these last daies boast of faith because it is not ioyned with profiting in knowledge with true conuersion vnto god with fruits of loue to god and man whereas all true faith is fruitefull in good workes ye did runne well who did letyou that ye should not obay the truth the meaning ye did runne well in these words paul alludes to the games of running vsed among the heathen and he compares the word and precepts of god to a way or race beleeuers to runners life eternall to the price god to the vmpire or iudge the lookers on are man and angels good and badde and the exercise of religion is the running in this race read of this corinthian philipp who the interrogation hath in it the force of a reproofe or complaint and the sense is this they did euill which turned you forth of the way and you haue done euill that you obaied not the truth the like is psalm why doe the heathen rage that is it is great wickednes for them to rage let stoppe intercept your course turne you out of the way that you should not obay that you should not giue credence to the doctrine of paul and obay it the scope these wordes are a repetition of the principall conclusion of the whole epistle and this repetition is not in vaine for it serues to bring the galatians to a consideration of their offence and to amendement of life hence i obserue that the often and serious consideration of our sinnes and liues past is a meanes to worke in vs a detestation of our sinnes and a reformation of life thus dauid saith that vpon consideration of his waies he turned his feete to god commandements psalm and the cause why there is so little amendement among vs is because we neuer so much as thinke what we haue done in these wordes paul sets downe three duties of christian people the first is that they must be runners in the race of god indeede the sabbath of the iewes figured a rest which is contrarie to running but this rest is from sinne and not from good duties this dutie of running teacheth vs foure things the first is that we must make hast without delay to keepe the commandements of god specially the commandements of faith repentance new obedience psalm contrariwise it is a great fault for youth amp others to deferre amendement till old age or till the last and deadly sicknes for that is the time to ende our running and not to beginne the second is that we are to increase and profit in all good duties specially in knowledge faith repentance but we in this age doe otherwise for either we stand at a staie or goe backe and very fewe of vs proceede forward in good duties and there are two causes of this one is blindnes of minde which makes vs that we see not how little our faith and repentance is and how great is the masse of our corruption the second is our vnbeleefe in the article of life euerlasting the third dutie is that we must neither looke to the right or left hand or looke to things behind vs to set our affection on them but we must presse on forward to the price of eternall life philipp luke here comes a common fault to be considered we in respect of profession goe forward yet we looke backe in our course and minde earthly things lastly we must not be mooued with the speaches of man which are giuen of vs either to or fro they are lookers on and must haue their speaches and our care must be not to heede them but to looke to our course the second dutie of christian people is that they must not onely be runners but they must runne well and that is done by beleeuing and by obaying the true religion or as paul saith by hauing faith and good conscience tim these are as it were the two feete by which we runne to life euerlasting vnder faith we are to comprehend the true acknowledgement of god affiance in him and inuocation ampc vnder good conscience is comprised the purpose of not sinning and the care to obay god in all his commandements to applie this to our selues runners we are but alas few of vs are good runners we haue one good foote and that is our faith or religion which is sound and good but we halt on the other foote our care to keepe conscience is not sutable to our religion and three things cause a lamenes or feeblenes in this foote the lust of the eye that is couetousnes the lust of the flesh and pride of life the third dutie is that we must runne the race from the beginning to the ende and finish our course so as we may apprehend life euerlasting tim tim corinthian and for this cause we must cherish in our hearts a loue and feruent desire of eternall life and by this meanes we shall be drawne on through all miseries and ouerpasse them to the ende secondly we must hold and maintaine a constant and daily purpose of not sinning and where we are the weakest there must our resolution be the strongest and thus shall we be constant to the death it is not the perswasion of him that calleth you the meaning this opinion of iustification by the workes of the law is not from god who hath called you from bondage to libertie the scope paul here meetes with a conceit of the galatians which was this why dost thou so often and so sharpely reprooue vs for we hould nothing against conscience but are perswaded of the thing which we say to this paul answers here this perswasion is not of god because it is against the calling of god for he calles you to libertie and this your opinion drawes you into bondage here we see the cause of mens declining from god and his worde and that is this man denie credence to god word amp listen to plausible perswasions and so fall awaie thus eue fell in the estate of innocencie by listning to the false perswasions of the deuill the papists usle themselues in their superstitions by a presumption that the church cannot erre and that god wil not leaue his church destitute of the assistace of his spirit our common people boulster themselues in their blind waies by a presumption that god is all of mercy and that if they doe their true intent serue god say their praiers deale iustly and doe as they would be done vnto they shall certenly be saued tradesmen often vse many practises of fraud and iniustice and that vpon a perswasion that they haue a charge and family which must be maintained if man now a daies will not blaspheme drinke and riot as others doe they shall be charged with precisenes and that comes vpon a perswasion that it sufficeth to auoid the outward and notorious crimes which are mentioned and condemned in the law thus the whole world is misled by blind perswasions secondly hence we learne to close vp our eyes as it were and absolutely to follow the calling of god amp to subiect all the powers of our soules vnto it thus did abraham when he was called to go he knew not whether and paul without vsing consultation went and preached in arabia at the calling of christ thirdly paul here sets downe a note to discerne of false doctrines and opinions in religion if they be sutable to the calling of god they are good if they be against the calling of god they are naught this is pauls rule god calles vs to libertie therefore the doctrine of iustification by the workes of the law is naught for it drawes vs into bondage in like ort god calles vs to free iustification and therefore the doctrine of humane satisfactions and of the merit of workes is naught againe god calls vs to an vtter deniall of our selues and therefore the popish doctrine of preparation and of freedome of will in the conuersion of a sinner is naught lastly it is to be obserued that paul saith in the time present of him that calleth you for hence it appeares that god continues to call the galatians euen after their fall in which they fell away to an other gospel and as much as in them lay abolished themselues from christ this shews god patience and that there is a possibilitie of mercie after great and grieuous falls it may be saide how long doth god continue to call man vnto him ans so long as he vouchsafeth them the benefit of the publike ministerie thus then more then fourtie yeares hath god called vs in england and for this cause it is our part to pray to god for hearing eares to be pearced in our hearts and we must answer the calling of god psalm at the least in the desires and groanes of our hearts and lastly we must in life and conuersation be sutable to the calling of god a little leauen leaueneth the whole lumpe the sense as a little leauen leaueneth and fauoreth the whole lumpe of dow euen so one errour or point of corrupt doctrine corrupteth the whole bodie of christian religion because all the points of religion are linked and compounded together so as if one be corrupt the rest cannot remaine ound and incorrupt the scope the obiection of the galatians is put case that we erre in ioyning circumcision and christ yet there is no cause why thou shouldest o sharpely reprooue vs for it is no great errour to ioyne workes and christ in the cause of our iustification paul answers to this obiection by a prouerbe saying that a little leauen of false doctrine corrupts the whole bodie of religion and one errour though it seeme to be of small moment at the first may at length bring with it the corruption and deprauation of many other points the vse in the example of the galatians we see what is the common fashion of man namely to extenuate their faults and to make small matters of great offences the phari ies taught that sundrie of god commandements were small and little commandements matth to them that make no conscience of sinne great sinnes are little sinnes and little sinnes are no sinnes pride is cleanlines couetousnes is nothing but worldlines drunkennes good fellowship fornication a tricke of youth thus man put visards vpon their vgly sinnes the polititian that is of no religion saith that we and the papists differ not in substance but in small circumstances and that if they erre it is but in small points but on the contrarie we are to esteeme euery sinne for a great sinne to humble our selues for the least sinnes and to bring our selues in subiection to god in the least of our actions here we are taught by all meanes to maintaine the puritie of sound religion whatsoeuer befall vs and for this cause we are to resist and withstand euery erronious opinion that shall be broched for it is the pollicie of the deuill by foisting in some one errour to depraue and confound the whole bodie of truth it may be saide how may we discerne errour from sound doctrine considering oftentimes they are like as leauen is like dowe ans leauen is discerned from dow not by colour but by tast euen so they which are spirituall and haue the gift of discerning directed by the analogie of faith discerne truth from falshood for whatsoeuer is against one article of faith or against any of the commandements of the decalogue is not sound doctrine but leauen againe that which is said of false doctrine may be said proportionally of bad manners here therefore we must be put in minde of three duties the first to resist and withstand euery particular sinne for euen one sinne is able to defile the whole life of man one flie is sufficient to marre a whole boxe of sweete ointment one offence in our first parents brought corruption vpon them and all mankind yes vpon heauen and earth he that makes no conscience of some one sinne is guiltie of the whole law iam secondly we must doe our indeauour to the vttermost to cut off euery bad example in the societies of man for one bad example is sufficient to corrupt a whole familie a whole town a whole country the example of one incestuous man was sufficient to corrupt all corinthian therefore paul saith purge out the old leauen corinthian the law of god is that blasphemers murderers adulterers ampc shall be put to death the reason is that euill may he taken away out of israel that is the euill of wicked example which beeing suffered spreads abroad and doth much hurt the barren figge tree must be cut downe least it make the whole ground barren luke thirdly we are to withstand and cut off the first beginnings and the occasions of euery sinne we say of arrand theeues that first they beginne to practise their wickednes in pinnes and points for this cause idlenes fulnesse of bread in excessiue eating drink and swilling iot and vanitie in apparrell are to be suppressed in euery societie as the breeders of many v ces on the contrarie as one point of euill doctrine brings with it many other so any one little grace of god brings many other with it the entrance into god word giues light psalm in this respect christ saith the kingdome of heauen is like leauen hidde in three peckes of meale because god kingdome is set vp in the heart at the first vpon very small beginnings matth this must teach vs to vse the meanes of our saluation and not to be discouraged though we haue in vs but some small beginnings of god grace i haue an affiance in you in the lord that ye will be no otherwise minded but he that troubleth you shall beare his iudgement whosoeuer he be the sense in the lord by the gratious assistance of god who no doubt will giue a blessing to my ministerie no otherwise minded that is thinke no otherwise then ye haue done and ought to thinke and thinke no otherwise then i haue taught you he that troubleth you the church is troubled three waies by false doctrine thus ahab troubled israel king and the false apostles trouble galatia by wicked example thus a han troubled israel ios by force and crueltie thus tyrants and persecutors trouble the church shall be are shall haue his due and deserued punishment partly in this life and partly in eternall death see this verified in the ende of the booke of english martyrs in the desperate horrible and stinking endes of persecutors but yet this threat must be vnderstood with the exception of repentance the scope the wordes are an answer to an obiection which may be framed thus it seemes by your former prouerb of leauen that you hold us to be a people corrupted and vnsauorie vnto god to this paul answers by a distinction i hope better things of you but the false apostles for troubling the church shall surely be punished the vse when paul saith i haue an a iance in you he teacheth in his own example that we are to hope the best of man so long as they are curable it may be saide they that hope the best are sometimes deceiued ans they are onely deceiued in their iudgement and that in things whereof they haue no certen knowledge and they are not deceiued in practise for it is a dutie of loue to hope the best and they which vse to suspect the worse are oftner deceiued againe it may be saide that we must iudge of things as they are indeede ans iudgement of things and iudgement of persons must be distinguished of things vpright iudgement is to iudge of them as they are and if they be doubt ull to suspend now our iudgement of the persons of man must be to take things in the better part as much as possibly may be lastly it may be alleadged that we must loue our neighbour as our selues and that we despaire in respect of our selues ans we are to despaire in respect of our selues because we are priuie to our owne estate but we are not priuie to the estate of any other man and therefore we are to hope the best of them this shewes the fault of our times if any professing the gospel fall vpon frailtie there are numbers of man that will make no bones of it to condemne them to the pit of hel for hypocrites but such persons are not carried by the spirit of paul who hopes the best of them that fall againe here we see how we are to put affiance in man we are to put affiance in god for all things whatsoeuer whether concerning bodie or soule but our affiance in man must be onely for such things as they are able to performe secondly we must put affiance in god absolutely for himselfe and therefore we say i beleeue in god ampc but all our affiance in man whatsoeuer must be in the lord when paul saith that he had affiance of them in the lord he shewes that renewed repentance is the gift of god and there are two graces required vnto it helping grace and exciting grace helping grace preserues and confirmes the first and initiall repentance exciting grace giues the will and the deede and without these graces the child of god if he fall cannot repent and recouer himselfe they therefore are deceiued who thinke that they may haue repentance at command and that they may repent when they will it may be demanded why paul vseth mild tearmes and doth not excommunicate the galatians ans so long as man are curable meanes must be vsed to recouer them the sheepe or oxe that goes astray must be brought home againe exod much more thy neighbour christ himselfe brings home againe the lost sheepe and so must euery shepheard ezech now the galatians were in all likelihood persons curable and therefore not to be cut off for the censure of excommunication pertaines to them alone of whose recouerie there is no hope some there be that mislike the preaching vsed in these daies because we vse not seueritie and personall reproofes after the manner of john baptist but these man are deceiued we haue not the like calling that he had nor like gifts neither are we in the like times for john the baptist was in the very time of the change betweene the old and the new testament christ did not follow him in the same manner of teaching neither doth the apostle in this place when he saith of the galatians in apostasie that he hoped better things of them in the last place the commination which the apostle vseth is to be obserued that troublers of the church shall beare their iudgement hence i gather that god watcheth ouer his church with a speciall prouidence we in england haue found this by experience and we are to be thankfull for it that the doctrine of the apostles is of infallible certentie because the oppugners of it are plagued by the iust iudgement of god on the contrarie our dutie is to pray for the good estate of the church of god and for the kingdomes where the church is planted and for the continuance of the gospel specially in england for what will all the things we haue doe vs good if we be forth of god kingdome and lose our soules and brother if i yet preach circumcision why doe i yet suffer persecution then is the scandall of the crosse abolished would to god they were cut off that trouble you the sense yet preach now while i am an apostle here paul takes it for graunted that when he was a pharisie he taught and maintained circumcision but he denies that he euer taught it after his conuersion in his apostleship the crosse the gospel which is a doctrine teaching deliuerance from hell and life euerlasting to be obtained by the death and passion of christ crucified corinthian more plainly the words are thus much in effect it is reported that i paul an apostle preach circumcision but the truth is there is no such matter for if i taught circumcision the iewes maintainers of circumcision would not persecute me as they doe neither would they take offence at the preaching of christ crucified if i ioyned circumcision with christ the drift paul here answers a new obiection which is on this manner there is no cause paul why thou shouldest thus reprooue vs for thou thy selfe article a teacher of circumcision to this paul makes a double answer first he denies the report and prooues his deniall by a double reason one is because the iewes still persecuted him the other is because they tooke offence still at his preaching of christ crucified secondly paul answers by pronouncing a curse vpon the false apostles the vse in the wordes i consider two things the report giuen forth of paul and his apologie the report was that paul preached circumcision in this we see what is the condition of the ministers of the word namely to be subiect to slander and defamation not onely in respect of their liues but also in respect of their ministerie and doctrine as if they were heretikes thus the papists at this day reproch the ministerie of the church of england charging it with sundrie foule heresies and many among vs spare not to charge it with the heresie of puritanisme and i doubt not to auouch it that some are condemned for here kes in the historie of the church who if all were knowne should be found to be good servant of god this verifies the saying of ecclesiastes c v there are righteous man to whome it befalls according to the worke of the wicked ministers must hence be put in minde to vse circumspection both for the matter and the manner of their preaching beeing defamed and that wrongfully they must hence take occasion to be more carefull to please god as dauid did in the like case psalm but how came this report of paul ans sometime he tollerated circumcision as a thing indifferent for a time and hereupon circumcised timothie and vpon this occasion a report is raised that paul preached circumcision in this we see the fashion of the world which is to raise fames reports and slanders of all persons specially vpon magistrates and ministers and that vpon euery light and vniust occasion but good man will take no such occasions of raising reports psalm but how did paul take this report ans he did not requite euill for euill as the manner of man is but he returnes loue and goodnes for euill and for this cause no doubt of purpose he beginnes his speech on this manner brother if i yet preach circumcision the apologie and defence followes and first he denies the report and this is because for his preaching he is persecuted of the iewes here obserue that they which are called to teach must preach the gospel what trouble or danger soeuer follow as paul did it may be demanded whether a minister may not in teaching conceale any part of the truth at any time without sinne ans in the case of confession when a man is called to giue an account of his faith no truth no not the least truth may be concealed againe when the soules of man are to be releeued and saued all concealements are damnable yet in the plant or in the restoring of the church doctrines most necessarie may be concealed paul was about two yeares at ephesus and spake nothing against diana but in generall tearmes if he had he had planted no church at ephesus againe when people be vncapable of doctrine it may be cocealed till they be prepared for it christ told his disciples that he had many things to tell them which they could not then learne some beleeuers must haue no strong meate but milke onely thirdly when the teaching of a less truth hinders the teaching of a fundamentall truth the less truth may be concealed that the fundamentall truth may be taught and take place here we see the fidelitie of paul if he had sought himselfe his honour profit or pleasure he would not haue taught any doctrine that should haue caused persecution the like minde must be in all teachers nay in all beleeuers who are to receiue the gospel for it selfe without respect to honour profit or pleasure paul addes further in way of defence that the scandall of the crosse was not abolished hence it followes that the gospel must be preached though all man be offended god must not be displeased though all man be displeased act indeede christ pronounceth woe against them by whome offences come but that is meant of offences giuen and not of offences taken of which christ hath an other rule matth let them alone they are the blind leaders of the blind againe by the offence of the iewes we see the mind of man who cannot be content with the death and passion of christ vnlesse they may adde workes or something els of their owne for their iustification and saluation thus doe the papists at this day and the like doe many of the ignorant people among vs that will be saued by their good dealing and their good seruing of god touching the imprecation in the verse three questions are to be propounded the first is whether paul did well thus to curse his enemy i answer yes for first we must put a difference betweene the priuate cause of man and the cause of god now paul accurseth the false apostles not in respect of his owne cause but in respect of the cause of god and not as his owne enemy but as the enemy of god secondly we must distinguish the persons of euill man some are curable and some againe are incurable of whose saluation there is no hope now paul directs his imprecation against persons incurable and he knew them to be incurable by some extraordinarie inspiration or instinct as the prophets and the rest of the apostles did in sundrie cases and hereupon he curseth sometime euen particular persons as alexander the coppersmith tim thirdly we must distinguish the affections of man some are carnall as rash anger hatred desire of reuenge ampc some againe are more spirituall and diuine as a zeale of god glorie and of the s tie of god church now paul in pronouncing the curse is not carried with a carnall affection but with a pure zeale of god glorie and with the same spirit by which he penned this epistle the second question is whether we may not curse our enemy as paul did ans no for we haue not the like spirit to discerne the persons of man what they are and our zeale of god glorie is mixed with many corrupt affections and therefore to be suspected we in our ordinary dealings haue an other rule to follow matth blesse and curse not if we dare goe beyond the limitts of this rule we must heare the speach of christ ye know not of what spirit ye are luke the third question is how we should vse the imprecations that are in the psalmes of dauid as psalm and in other places of scripture ans they are to be directed generally against the kingdome of the deuill and they are further to be vsed as prophecies of the holy ghost comforting his church and procuring a finall sentence vpon the enemy of god the word which is translated disquiet is to be considered for it signifies to put man out of their estate and to driue them out of house and home as enemy doe when they sacke and spoile a towne by this we se that the doctrine of iustification by workes or by the law is a doctrine full of danger and peril because it puts man out of their estate in christ and ber aues them of their saluation in heauen therefore let all man flie from the religion of the papist as if they would flie from an armie of spaniard or turkes contrariwise they that would prouide well for themselues and their posteritie and plant themselues in a good estate must take this course they must cosider that there is a citie of god in heauen the gates and suburbes whereof be vpon earth in the assemblies of the church that this citie hath many roomes and habitations amp many liberties that the law wherby this citie is ruled is the whole word of god specially the doctrine of the gospell in this citie is all happines and out of it there is nothing but woe and misery enter therfore into the suburbes of this citie of god as ye professe the gospell so subiect your mindes and consciences and all your affections to it and be doers of it in the exercise of faith repentance new obedience thus shall you haue a good estate in christ amp ioyfull habitation in heauen for brother ye haue bin called to libertie only vse not your libertie as an occasion to the flesh but by loue serue one another the first part of the epistle touching the faith of the galatians is ended and here beginnes the second part touching good life and it continues from this verse to the verse of the sixt chapter in it paul doth things first he propounds the summe of his doctrine amp then after makes a particular declaration of it the summe of all is propounded in this v in which paul first setts downe the ground of all good duties and then maine rules of good life the ground is in these wordes brother ye haue bin called to libertie and it must be noted that as these wordes are the foundation of that which followes so are they also the reason of that which goes before and therefore paul saith for brother ampc the rules are in the words following one in these vse not your libertie as an occasion to the flesh the other in these doe seruice one to another by loue in the ground of all good duties namely the calling to libertie things are to be considered who calls who are called what is the calling of god why it is here mentioned by paul to the first who calles i answer god the father in christ by the spirit for he is absolute lord of all his creatures amp therfore he may call out of the kingdome of darknes into his owne kingdome whome he will and it is god alone that calleth the things that are not as though they were rom the second is who are called ans all they that any waie answer the calling of god for paul saith indifferently of all the galatians that they were called now man answer the calling of god some in profession some in heart amp some in both and all these are said to be called yet with some difference the calling of god is directed first of all and principally to the elect and then in the second place it pertaines to them which are not elect because they are mixed in societie with the elect and hence ariseth a distinction of the calling of god sometime it is operatiue because god signifies and withall workes his will in the elect sometimes againe in respect of others it is only significatiue when god reueales his will to man but spares to worke it for iust causes knowne to himselfe the third point is what is the calling to libertie ans an action of god translating man from the kingdome of darknes to his owne kingdome it hath parts inuitement and admission inuitement is when god offers remission of sinnes amp life euerlasting to them that beleeue outwardly by the preaching of the gospell inwardly by the inspiration of heauenly desires admission is when man are entred into the kingdome of grace and it is either outward or inward outward admission is made in baptisme inward admission is when man are taken out of olde adam and by faith ingrafted into christ for by this ins tion into christ man are made reall members of god kingdome the last question is why paul mentions the calling to libertie in this place ans it is the ground of all comfort by it paul comforts the corinthians corinthian againe it is the ground of good life therefore peter saith be ye holy as he that hath called you is holy pet and paul walke worthie the calling wherewith he hath called you ephesians if the calling of god doe not mooue vs to amendement of life nothing will doe it we in england haue heard the calling of god more then yeares and yet very few of vs are mooued to change and amend our liues this shewes our atheisme and vnbeleefe here is almost nothing but heauing shouing and lifting for the world some are held captiues of their couetousnes some of their pride some of their damnable and fleshly lusts and all this shewes that few or none so much as dreame of a calling to spirituall libertie the first rule followes only vse not your libertie as an occasion to the flesh the sense flesh hereby the papists vnderstand sensualitie or carnall appetites but hereby is ment the corruption of all the powers of the soule euen of reason and conscience paul saith that the wisdom or vnderstanding of the flesh is emnity to god rom fleshlines therefore pertaines to the vnderstanding againe he saith of some that they are puffed vp in the mind of the flesh column and he willes the ephesians to be renewed in the spirit of their minds ephesians the meaning then of the rule is this vse not the benefit of spirituall libertie as an occasion to the flesh to liue according to the flesh here i consider three things what is the abuse of libertie where is this abuse to be found and what is the right vse thereof the first question is what is the abuse of christian libertie ans to vse it as an occasion of fleshly and carnall libertie amp that is done waies the first is when man make more things indifferent the god euer made thus the corinthians vsed fornication as a thing indifferent corinthian to many in these daies drunkennes and surfetting is but a thing indifferent man vse not to distinguish a thing indifferent and the vse of it but they commonly thinke that if the thing be indifferent in it selfe then also the vse of it is indifferent thus all abuses of meat drinke apparrell all rioting and gaming dicing and carding ampc are excused by the names of things indifferent secondly our libertie is abused by an immoderate vse of the gifts of god the vse of them is immoderate waies first in respect of time as when diues fared deliciously and was arraied in rich attire euery day thus many gentlemen and others offend when they turne recreation into an occupation secondly the gifts of god are immoderatly vsed in respect of themselues as when man exceed in eating and drink as the prophet saith deut adding drunkennes to thirst thirdly in respect of the callings and conditions of man for euery man is to vse the gifts of god according to his place and condition they then offend that beeing but meane persons amp liuing by trade yet for their diet and apparrel are as great gentlemen amp gentlewomen thirdly liberty is abused when the blessings of god are made instruments and as it were flagges and banners to display our riot vanitie ostentation pride for this cause sundry things whereof some are indifferent in themselues are condemned isai the second question is where is this abuse ans euen among vs in england it is the fashion of man to take vnto themselues a toleration of sinning some vpon the pacience of god others vpon the doctrine of the gratious election of god saying that they will liue as they list because if they be elected to saluation they shall certenly be saued whatsoeuer they doe and some there be that take occasion to continue in their sinnes vpon the mercy of god in the death and passion of christ a certen dweller in this towne of cambridge made awaie himselfe in his bosome was found a writing to this effect that god did shew mercie on great grecuous and desperate sinners and therefore he said that he hoped of mercy though he hanged himselfe of this mind are many ignorant persons who perseuering in their sinnes yet perswade themselues of mercy because they haue heard that christ died for mankind and thus the death of christ is as it were a licence or letters patents to commit sinne againe great is the abuse of meat drinke and apparell to elijah there came an angell and said arise and eate king but to the man of our daies there had need come an angell and saie cease to eate cease to drinke cease to game the third questio is what is the right vse of christian libertie ans it stands in things first of all we our selues must be renewed and sanctified to the pure all things are pure tit the person must first please god before the action can please him the second is that beside the lawful vse of the creatures we must haue a spirituall amp holy vse of the the lawful vse of the creature i call the politick vse therof comonly allowed amp take vp among man the spirituall vse is whereby we receiue amp vse the creature as from the hand of god the father in christ according to his will and word and the godly are not to seperate the one vse from the other but are bound by vertue of the commandement to take vp an holy vse of euery gift of god when noe came out of the arke so soone as he sett foote vpon the earth he built an altar offered sacrifice and called on the name of god not only for this end to worship god but also to sanctifie the earth and all the creatures of god vnto his vse the like did abraham when he come into the land of canaan and to this end we must obserue rules the first that the creatures of god must be sanctified by the word and praier tim the word must shew vs what we may doe and praier obtaines the doing of it the rule we must be circumspect lest we sinne in the vse of the creatures in this respect iob sends for his children after they had feasted together amp he sanctifies them iob the rule we must vse the gifts of god with thankesgiuing rom commonly in these daies there is no feasting or reioycing vnles all memorie of god be buried for that is said to breed melancholy the rule we must suffer our selues to be limited and moderated in the vse of our libertie partly by the law of the magistrate amp partly by the law of charitie in the case of offece i say in the vse because liberty it selfe is inwardly in the conscience and the vse of it is often in the outward action and therefore vnder the order of humane law the rule our liberty must be vsed for right ends as namely the glory of god corinthian the preseruation of nature amp not the pampering of the flesh rom the good of our neighbour rom make conscience to obserue this rule and the rather because the holie and spirituall vse of christian libertie is a signe amp token that thou article in the kingdome of god amp a true member thereof as on the contrarie the abuse of god blessings shewes thee to be still in the kingdome of darknes when man fell things of great worth for a little value and then afterward giue themselues to rioting and spending we commonly say that they are theeues and no right owners of the goods which they solde the like may be said of them that abuse spirituall libertie that they are but vsurpers and no right owners of it lastly it must be obserued that this rule hath branches the first is that we must not minister to the flesh any occasion of sinning the second is that we must giue no occasion of sinning by meanes of christian libertie the second maine rule followes serue one an other by loue for the right coceauing of it i will propound three questions the first is why is this rule propounded in this place ans it sets downe the end of all apostolike doctrine as paul sheweth tim the end of the commandement is loue out of a pure heart good conscience faith vnfained here man commonly vnderstand by the commandement the morall law that is indeed a truth but it is not the meaning of the place in the third verse paul sets downe a commandement or denunciation to timothie that he and the pastors of ephesus teach no other doctrine but the doctrine of the apostles then in the verse he propounds the summe and substance or end of the foresaid commandement in the verse after a long antapodaton he inioynes timothie to obserue it carefully so then the end of al sound doctrine is loue out of a pure heart and all our preaching must tend to this the second question is what is the loue of our neighbour specified in this rule ans it is an affection renewed whereby we are mooued to wish well to our neighbour in the lord i say an affection to consute lombard who saith that loue is not an habit in vs as other vertues are but the h ghost i saie it is an affection renued to consute the papist who teacheth that we haue the true loue of god amp our neighbour by nature and that we want nothing but the second acte or the exercise of loue which they saie is from grace further i adde that loue inclines vs to wish well to our neighbour for this is the formall and proper effect of loue and all this is done when we thinke well speake and doe well and that in respect not only of the bodie but also in respect of the soule of our neighbour lastly i say that loue to our neighbour must be in the lord because we are to loue him in respect that he is a creature of god and beares his image and not in respect of honour profit or pleasure which we receiue from him loue for such ends is selfeloue the third question is what is the vse of loue ans it serues to make vs seruiceable to our neighbour loue seekes not her owne things corinthian christ was servant to his enemy in bearing their sinnes vpon the crosse paul that was free from all became a servant to all to win some corinthian to christ we are to doe seruice and he hath put our neighbour in his stead so as that which is done to our neighbour shall be done to him our neighbour therefore must be serued of vs and this is not against our libertie for we are free inwardly in conscience yet in the outward vse of our libertie we must be seruats to me the vse if we examine our liuer by this rule we shall find that there is very litle power of religion among man there are six sortes of man that liue in the breach of this rule the first are vsurers who lend for aduantage when they should lend freely to them that are in need these serue themselues and make a pray of all the second sort are ingrossers who gather in comodities to inrich themselues the third sort are idle per son of what degree soeuer that spend their time in eating drink sleeping gaming such are but vnprofitable burdens of the earth to this sort i referre beggars and vagabonds the fourth sort are riotous persons that vse to goe from alehouse to alehouse from tauerne to tauerne and mispend that whereby they should maintaine their families and be seruiceable to their country the fift sort are tradesmen who in their dealings vse lying dissembling fraud iniustice they seeke nothing but their priuate aduantage and this kind of man abounds in the world the last sort are drowsie and carnall protestant who only seeke the things of this world and neuer so much as giue good example to servant or children or any good counsell beside all this it is the common fault of the world for man to serue themselues according to the common saying euery man for himselfe and god for vs all and the best man that are if they examine themselues shall find that they faile many waies and come short in the duties of loue to man with whome they liue this beeing so we are to acknowledge before god this maine offence of ours and to intreat for the pardon of it for christes sake and euer hereafter to change our liues and to reforme them according to this rule and that is done on this manner euery man hath or ought to haue callings a general amp a particular the general is wherby we are called to be christians in this calling we are to do good to all man by teaching admonishing exhorting and by example of good life a particular calling whereby man are called to some estate of life in the familie church or common wealth and according to the seuerall conditions of particular callings must euery man in his place doe the good he can the magistrate must vse his office first for the maintenance of the gospell and then for the execution of iustice the minister must preach sound religion in loue of the soules of man the master of the familie must cause his househould to imbrace the gospell and frequent the exercises of religion lastly euery man that is in a trade or office must apply himselfe to the vttermost of his power to do all he can for the good of his country and he must so deale that he may be helpefull to all with whome he deales and hurtfull to none we are or should be trees of righteousnes our fruite must be meate for others and our leaues for medecines we must be as candles that spend themselues to giue light to others for all the law is fulfilled in one word which is this thou shalt loue thy neighbour as thy selfe fulfilled comprised rom one word one precept for the h g calles precepts words it may be demanded how the whole law should be fulfilled in the loue of our neighbour ans the loue of god and the loue of our neighbour are ioyned together as the cause and the effect and the loue of god is practised in the loue of our neigbour for god that is inuisible will be loued in the person of our neighbour whome we see and with whome we conuerse and the first commandement of the law must be included in all the commandements following and thus the loue of god is presupposed in euery commandement of the second table he therefore that loues his neigbour loues god also thou shalt loue vnderstand both the affection and the duties of loue thy neighbour any one that is neare vnto vs in res t of mans nature isai though he be our enemy yet i by any occasion he be offered vnto vs of god he is our neighbour as thy selfe these wordes signifie not the measure of our loue as though we should loue our selues in the first place and the our neighbour in the second place for there are some cases in which we are to loue our neighbour more the our selues as for example we are more to loue the soule of our brother then our temporall life and a good subiect is more to loue the life of his prince then his owne life here then the h g signifies what must be the manner of our loue the word as signifies not quantitie but qualitie and that we are as truly and earnestly with loue to imbrace our neighbour as our selues the scope the words cotaine a reason of the second rule which may be framed thus to serue our neighbour in duties of loue is the keeping of the whole law therefore this seruice must carefully be performed the vse here we see that the end of a mans life is to serue god in seruing of man for this is the summe of the whole law servant are commanded in seruing their masters to serue god and to do whatsoeuer they doe as vnto god column and so euery man in his place in dealing with man must so deale as if he were to deale with god himselfe therefore most man prophane their liues when they make the scope and drift therof to be the getting of riches and honours and though they haue great charges that is no excuse for the principal end of our liuing here is to performe seruice to man and in this seruice to do homage to god for which homage god will giue the honour and riches which he sees to be conuenient for vs secondly here we may obserue what is true religion and godlines namely to loue and serue god in seruing of man he that saith he loues god and yet hates his brother is a lier ioh and here it followes that to liue out of all societie of man though it be in praier and fasting after monkish fashion is no state of perfection but mere superstition for that is true and perfect loue of god that is shewed in duties of loue and in the edification of our neighbour againe the hypocrisie of sundrie protestant is here discouered if they come to the church and heare sermons amp frequent the lord they thinke they may do afterward what they will and many such are frequenters of tauernes and alchouses and are giuen to riot and licenciousnes but it is not inough for thee to be holy in the church thou maiest be a saint in the church and a deuill at home true religion is that which shewes it selfe in thy priuate house priuate dealings and in the course of thine owne life such as thou article in thy particular calling such article thou indeed and truth what showes soeuer thou makest before man if ye bite and deuoure one another take heed that ye be not consumed one of another the sense if ye bite here paul alludes to the fashio of wild beast as lions wolues ampc and by biting we are to vnderstand all iniuries in words as railing cursing slandering bacbiting ampc deuoure here paul vnderstands all iniuries in deed or violence euen to the shedding of blood take heed lest here paul signifies that contentions amp dissentions breed the destruction and desolation of the church the scope these wordes are a second reason of the second rule drawne from the dangerous effect of the contrarie thus contentions breed the desolation of the church therefore do seruice one to an other by loue the contents in the words paul deliuers things the first is that there were greeuous contentions in the church of galatia the like also were in the church of corinthian corinthian the cause of the former contentions were differences in points of religion some of the galatians no doubt withstanding circumcision and the most of them standing for it for herevpon great were the dissentions of the churches in iudea act obserue then that vnitie is not an infallible and an inseperable marke of the church of god vnitie may be out of the church and dissention in the church as here we see it may be obiected that there is peace in the kingdome of god and that there the wolfe and the lambe dwell together isai ans this is but in part verified in the kingdome of grace vpon earth and it is fully accomplished in the kingdome of glorie in heauen againe it may be alleaged that the church is the company of them that truly consent in one and the same faith ans that is properly meant of the catholike church but the case is otherwise in particular churches where true beleeuers are mixed with hypocrites wherevpon ariseth much dissention and of true beleeuers some are more carnall then spirituall and that is another cause of dissention corint the second point concernes the qualitie of these dissentios when paul saith if ye bite and deuoure ampc he signifies that they were fierce and violent and such commonly are dissentions for religion as appeares by the persecution in queene maries daies the heate whereof nothing could slake but mans blood againe he signifies in these very wordes that they were bru ish and beastlike more beseeming wolues lions dogges then man this must teach vs to detest railing cursing euill speaking fighting vnles it be in the case of necessarie defence for by these actions we degenerate to the condition of beastes and repell from vs the worke of grace for christ of lions wolfes beares hath made vs his sheepe and lambes isai the third point is touching the effect of contention amp that is the ruine amp desolation of the church the diuision of the members among themselues is the dissolutio of the whole bodie differences in points of religion breed doubting doubting hinders faith and inuocation and the free course of the gospell and where these be hindred the church goes to decay and by reason of the dissentions that be in these last daies many liue as atheistes and will be of no religion by this we are to be admonished to studie and to vse all meanes to maintaine christian peace and concord ephesians to this end we must remember one generall rule rom haue peace with all man and withall we must obserue the cautions which paul addes one is if it may be with good conscience for there are some with whome there is no peace vnles we sooth them in their vices or denie our religion either in whole or in part the second is if it lie in you for sometime man are accused and must of necessitie defend themselues these two cautions obserued peace must be had with all man it may the be demanded why do not the protestans make a pacification with the papists ans we are content so to do in respect of ciuill societie but not in respect of religion we haue a commandement to the contrarie revelation come out of babylon my people and touch no vnclean thing where a pacification is made both the partes must yeeld somewhat but we may not yeeld in any point of our religion to the papists in an instrument of musick the stringes out of tune are set vp or set downe to the rest and the strings that are in tune are not stirred euen so the papists are to turne to vs we are not to turne to them our religion beeing the doctrine of the prophets amp apostles peace is three fould church peace ciuill peace houshould peace all these are to be maintained touching church peace i giue rules the first is that for the ending of differences in religion there must be conferences in a free or christian councell the spirits of the prophets is subiect to the prophet corinthian when there arose differences in the churches of iudea the apostles and elders came together to inquire of the matter act and this is a thing much to be desired in these daies specially in these westerne partes of the world it may be demanded why did not the protestant ioyne with the papists at the councell of trent ans from the first session it was more then yeares before any safe conduct was giuen to the protestant and at their appearing in the councell exception was taken against their letters and they dismissed and when they appeared the second time vpon new safe conduct the councell was the next day reiorned for yeares and when safe conduct was giuen the time the protestant princes refused to send their diuines because they had bin twice mocked moreouer the councell was not a free councell because the pope himselfe was both partie and iudge the second rule there must be a christian toleration one of an other ephesians here that we mistake not i propound questions one is in what must there be a toleration ans a toleration presupposeth an errour or defect in our brother an errour is either in iudgement or manners an error in iudgment is either in the foundation of religion or beside the foundation in lighter matters if the errour be in the foundation there is no toleration of it if it be in some less matter a toleration is to be vsed according to the rule of the apostle if ye be otherwise minded god will reueile it philipp when others see not that which we see we must not presetly codemne them but tolerat their ignorance till god reueile his truth vnto them againe errors in manners be of sortes some without offence as hastines frowardnes vaine gloriousnes ampc these we must tolerate pro and others with open offence and such admit no toleration corinthian the second question is to what ende must we tolerate the infirmities and ignorances of our brother ans toleration must tend to the good and edification of man rom we must not so tolerate as that we approoue of the least vice or betray the least part of god truth it may here be demanded whether there may not be a toleration for popery ans no the toleration of two religions in one kingdome is the ouerthrow of peace againe popery is a religion both hereticall and schismaticall it may be said that faith and conscience is free i answer though faith in the heart and conscience in it selfe be free in respect of mans authoritie yet is not the publishing of faith and the profession of conscience free in like sort but it stands subiect to the power of the magistrate the third rule euery man in his place specially teachers must set themselues to build the church iud v ephesians indeede the truth is to be defended but marke how the truth must be confessed when time and occasion serues without opposition this done all contentions laid aside we must set our selues to build the church and the rather ministers of god word in england must remember this because while we are striuing among our selues in sundrie points of difference the papist our common enemie gets ground touching ciuill peace it must be remembred that the peace and good estate of ierusalem stood in this that it was made the seate of god sanctuarie and the throne of iustice psalm when the arke was in the house of obed edom all things prospered with him now in the new testament the preaching of the gospel inuocation of god name with the vse of the sacraments come in the roome of the sanctuarie ciuill peace then is maintained when man yeeld subiection to the gospel of christ which brings peace to all that receiue it touching houshold peace i giue two rules one is that gouernours of families must vrge and compell all vnder them to admit at the least outwardly the practise of religion in the exercises of faith repentance new obedience thus did abraham gen and iosua c they that doe not first of all consent in christ cannot consent among themselues secondly it must be obserued that a familie is the schoole of god in which he will exercise our faith inuocation loue patience long suffering ampc and there is more vertue to be seene in the well ordering of a familie then in the pretended holines of monkish cloisters thus we see how we are to maintaine the vnitie of the spirit in the bond of peace for the better inforcing of this dutie paul ephesians giues seauen reasons one bodie one spirit one hope of eternall life one lord one faith one baptisme one father of all it may be said we are at peace what needes all this adoe ans the peace of many is peace in drunkennes called good fellowship peace in prophanes and wickednes this is the devil peace where he beares the sway the peace of which i now speake is in the lord and in the true worship of god of which read isa where man are saide hand in hand to goe vp to the mountaine of the lord that they may heare his will and ioyntly obay it then i say walke in the spirit and ye shall not fullfill the lust of the flesh the scope here paul returnes to the first rule v and shewes the waie how it is to be obserued thus if ye walke in the spirit ye shall not fullfill the lustes of the flesh and when the lusts of the flesh are not fulfilled there shall no occasion be giuen to the flesh by the vse of christian libertie the words containe two parts a rule walke in the spirit amp the benefit that comes by the rule ye shall not fullfill the lustes of the flesh in the rule i consider two things what is the spirit and what is walking the spirit is the gift of regeneration lost by adam restored by christ i say it is a gift and this gift is termed by the name of the spirit because the spirit worketh it immediatly in vs from the father and the son againe i say it is a gift of regeneration to make a distinctio bewteene it amp ciuill vertue for there is a gift of regeneration which mortifies corruption and a gift of restraint which serues only to keepe in corruption of this second kind are all ciuill vertues in naturall and heathen man and not of the first ioseph is chast and so was xenocrates iosephs chastitie is a part of regeneration and proceedes from the spirt here mentioned but the chastitie of xenocrates is not so proceeding only from the generall prouidence of god and not from the spirit of sanctification the like i say of all other ciuill vertues more plainly the spirit is a diuine nature qualitie or codition whereby we are made conformable to christ in righteousnes and holines the spirit hath fiue properties the first that it is a rich and liberall grace of god for it containes in it the seede of all vertues and all necessarie graces of god because it comes in the roome of originall sinne which containes in it the seedes of all vices or sinnes the second is the largenes of it for this spirit is in all the powers of them that are regenerat that is in the mind conscience will affections and in the sensuall appetite thes and he that is sanctified in on part is sanctified in all hence it followes that they which haue plentie of illumination without change of affection and life are indeed carnall and not spirituall the third propertie is sinceritie for the grace of god is without falsehood or guile psalm hence ariseth the difference betweene the godly man and an hypocrite betweene the workes of nature and the workes of grace there are man that in distresse desire the assistance amp fauour of god and they do it without the spirit of god for they do it deceitfully desiring god fauour not for it selfe but in respect of some euill from which they would be deliuered as the mariners in ionas and pharao did againe there are man that mourne for their sinnes without the spirit of god for there is much falsehood in their mourning because they mourne for sinne in respect of the punishment thereof and not in respect of the offence of god lastly there are that pretend a loue to god and yet want the spirit for they loue god in respect of his benefits as saul loued god for a kingdome such loue is mercenarie amp a worke of nature whereas the loue which is from the spirit makes vs loue god for himselfe the fourth propertie is excellencie for the spirit of grace in christians is more excellent then the grace of creation in two respects first in respect of the beginning thereof for the spirit is from christ the second adam both god and man the grace of creation should haue beene conuayed vnto vs from the first adam but a meere man if he had stood secondly in respect of constancie for god gaue to adam the will to perseuere if he would he giueth further to beleeuers both the wll to perseuere and the deed the fifte propery is liuelines whereby the spirit is effectuall in operation elihu saith that the spirit compelled him and was in him as a vessell of new wine which must haue a vent iob of the operation of the spirit i deliuer three things the first that the spirit workes in and by the word of god which therefore is called the ministerie of the spirit corinthian the second that the spirit worketh by certaine degrees the first degree and the very first beginning of his diuine operation is to make vs feele in what great neede we stand of christ amp to desire to be recociled and turned vnto god this is the first motion of the spirit in vs and they which want this haue nothing as yet of the grace of god in them the third that the whole worke of the spirit may be reduced to three actions the first is to cast downe euery thing in vs that exalts it selfe against god corinthian as namely to beat downe erronious reason and rebellious affection and to put a man out of heart with his chiefe deligtes and with his owne selfe the second action is to kindle in our hearts a care and desire of reconciliation with god in christ hence the spirit is called the spirit of grace and supplication zach the third action is to write the law in our hearts and that is done by putting a new light of knowledge into the minde and new inclinations into the will and affections thus much of the spirit walking in the spirit is to order our liues according to the direction and motion of the spirit for as the spirit renewes our nature within so it makes vs to change and renew our actions in three respects first it makes vs put a further beginning to our actions then nature can afford causing vs to doe them in faith whereby we beleeue that our persons please god in christ that our worke to be done pleaseth god that the defect of the worke is pardoned secondly the spirit makes vs doe our actions in a new manner namely in obedience to the written word thirdly it makes vs put a new end to our actions that is to intend and desire to honour god in the things that we doe for example a man is wronged by his neighbour and nature tells him that he must requite euill with euill yet he resolues to doe otherwise for saith he god in christ hath forgiuen me many sinnes therefore must i forgiue my neighbour and he remembreth that vengeance is god and that he is taught so to aske pardon as he forgiueth others and hereupon he sets himselfe to requite euill with goodnesse this is to liue in the spirit the vse by this rule we see that most of vs faile in our duties for many of vs professing christ liue not according to the lawes of nature in our common dealings we minde earthly things and therefore we are carnall it is a principle with many that if we keepe the church obserue the queenes laws which are indeed to be obserued and auoid open and grosse sinnes we do all that god requires at our hads hereupon to walke in the spirit is thought to be a worke of precisenes more then needes and they which deeme it to be a worke of precisenes walke not in the spirit and indeede they which haue receiued the greatest measure of the spirit must say with paul that they are carnall sould vnder sinne rom secondly this rule telleth vs that we must become spirituall man such as make conscience of euery sinne and doe things lawful in spirituall manner in faith and obedience and not as carnall man doe them carnally it may be saide that ministers of the word must be spirituall man i answer if thou whatsoeuer thou article be not spirituall thou hast no part in christ rom and the rather thou must be spirituall because a naturall man may doe the outward duties of religion in a carnall sort thirdly we must not iudge any mans estate before god by any one or some few actions either good or badde but by his walking or by the course of his life which if it be carnall it shewes the partie to be carnall if it be spirituall it shewes him to be spirituall the benefit that ariseth by the keeping of the rule followes in these words ye shall not fulfill the lusts of the flesh flesh the corruption of nature the roote of all sinnes lusts inordinate motions in the minde will and affections thus largely is lust taken in the tenth commandement which condemneth the first motions to euill fulfill fulfilling is not a simple doing of euill but the accomplishing of lust with loue pleasure and full consent of will as also perseuerance in euill by adding sinne to sinne a question how farre doth the child of god proceede in the lust of the flesh answer he is assaulted by the lusts of the flesh but he doth not accomplish them more plainly there are fiue degrees of lust suggestion delight consent the acte perseuerance in the acte suggestion and delight whereby the minde is drawne away are incident to the child of god consent is not ordinarily and if at any time the child of god consent to the lusts of his flesh it is but in part and against his purpose because he is ouercarried likewise the acte or execution of lust is not ordinarily and vsually in the child of god if at any time he fall he may say with paul i doe that which i hate lastly perseuerance in euill doth not befall the child of god because vpon his fall he recouers himselfe by new repentance in this sense s john saith he that is borne of god sinnes not ioh the vse hence it followes that the lust of the flesh is in the child of god to the death and consequently they doe not fulfill the law neither can they be iustified thereby as popish doctrine is secondly our dutie is not to accomplish the lusts of the flesh but to resist them to the vttermost rom thirdly here is comfort for the servant of god some man may say i am vexed and turmoiled with wicked thoughts and desires so as i feare i am not god child i answer againe for all this despaire not for if thou hate and detest the lusts that are in thee if thou resist them and wage battell against them if beeing ouertaken at any time thou recouer they selfe by new repentance they shall neuer be laid to thy charge to condemnation rom it is here made a prerogatiue of god child when the lusts of the flesh are in him not to accomplish them or to liue in subiection to them for the flesh lusteth against the spirit and the spirit against the flesh and they are contrarie one to another so that ye cannot doe the things which ye would these wordes are a reason of the former verse thus if ye walke in the spirit ye shall not fulfill the lusts of the flesh for the flesh and spirit beeing contrarie mutually refist and withstand one another so as ye can neither doe the good not the euill which ye would paul here sets forth a spirituall combate of which sixe things are to be considered the first is concerning the parties by whome the combat is made namely the flesh and the spirit the flesh signifies the corruption of the whole nature of man and the spirit is the gift of regeneration as hath beene shewed it may be demanded how these twaine beeing but qualities can be said to fight together ans the flesh and the spirit are mixed together in the whole man regenerate and in all the powers of the soule of man fire and water are said to be mixed in compound body light and darknes are mixed in the aire at the dawning of the day in a vessell of luke warme water heat and cold are mixed together we cannot saie that the water is in one parte hott and in another cold but the whole quantitie of water is hott in parte and cold in parte euen so the man regenerate is not in one part flesh amp in another part spirit but the whole mind is partly flesh and partly spirit and so are the will and affections through out partly spirituall and partly carnall now vpon this mixture it comes to passe that the powers of the soule are carried and disposed diverse waies and hereupon followes the combat the second point concernes the meanes whereby this combate is made and that is a two sold concupiscence expressed in these words the flesh lusteth against the spirit and the spirit against the flesh the lust of the flesh shewes it selfe in two actions the first is to defile represse the good motions of the spirit in this respect paul saith when i would do good euill is present and the law of the flesh rebelles against the law of the mind rom hereupon the flesh is fitly resembled by the disease called ephialtes or the mare in which man in their slumber thinke they feele a thing as heauie as a mountaine lying on their brests which they can no waie remoue the second action of the flesh is to bring forth and to fill the mind with wicked cogitations and rebellious inclinations in this respect concupiscence is said to tempt intice and draw away the mind of man iam againe the lust of the spirit hath two other actions the first is to curbe and restraine the flesh thus saint john saith that the seed of grace keepes the regenerate that they can not sinne ioh the second action of the spirit is to ingender good motions cogitations and inclinations agreeable to the will of god thus dauid saith that his raines did teach him in the night season psalm and the prophet isai saith thine eare shall heare a voice saying here is the way walke in it when thou urnest to the right hand or to the left c v and this voice no doubt is not only the voice of such as be teachers but also the inward voice of the spirit of god in vs and thus by the concurrence of these contrarie actions in one and the same man is this combat made the third point is concerning the cause of this combat in these wordes and these are contrarie one to another the contrarietie of the flesh and the spirit makes the combat and the contrarietie is very great for the spirit is the gift of righteousnes and the flesh standes in a double opposition to it for it is first of all the want of righteousnes and secondly a prones to all vnrighteousnes that is to say not a single but a double priuation or want of the grace or gift of god hence i gather that man hath no freedome of will in good duties before his conuersion because he is then wholly flesh and wants the spirit of god and the flesh is flat contrarie to the spirit and one contrarie hath no power at all to bring forth the effect of his contrarie and hence it followes that there are no such workes wherby a man may prepare himselfe to his owne iustification for though the mind be inlightned with a general faith yet man before he be iustified is nothing but flesh and flesh beeing in nature opposite to the spirit can make no preparation for the spirit no more then darknes can make preparation for the entrance of light the fourth point is concerning the persons in whome this combate is to be found and they are beleeuers not vnbeleeuers or wicked man such as the galatians were to whome this combate is said to belong it may be alleaged that naturall man haue a combate in them for they can say i see and approoue that which is good but i doe that which is naught ans this combate is betweene the naturall conscience and rebellious affection and it is incident to all man that haue in them any conscience or light of reason but the combate of the flesh and the spirit is of an other kinde for in it the mind is carried against it selfe the will against it selfe and the affections against themselues by reason they are partly spirituall and partly carnall secondly not all beleeuers haue this combate in them but only such as be of yeares for infants though they haue the seede of grace in them yet do they want the act or exercise thereof and therefore they feele not this combate because it standes in action thirdly this combate is in the godly for the time of this life only because in death the flesh is abolished and consequently the combate it selfe the fift point is in what things doth this combate shew it selfe ans in all the actions of man regenerate which paul signifies when he saith ye cannot do the things which ye would for example in praier sometime we feele feruent desires and sometime againe deadnes of spirit sometimes faith sometimes doubting this combate is in all the actions of the godly specially in good actions thus much paul teacheth whe he saith i find by the law of god that when i would do good evil is present rom and i do not the good which i would but the euill which i would not that do i v and that we mistake not it must be remembred that paul speakes all this of himselfe as beeing regenerate that he speakes it not of this or that action but of the course of his life in which he willed and indeauoured to do that which was good and acceptable to god and that appeares by the very wordes when he saith to will is present with me and i would do good but i do it not marke further while paul wills and indeauours to do that which is good if he faile and do amisse he may well say it is not i that do it but the flesh that dwelles in me and vngodly man for the couering of their wickednes if they say as they do that it is their flesh that sinneth and not they the abuse the holy doctrine and example of paul the last point concernes the effect of the combate which is to hinder the godly that they cannot do that which they would and that three waies first it makes them that they cannot sinne that is liue in practise of any one sinne john secondly if at any time they fall it s aies and keepes them that they sinne not with full consent of will for they say when they sinne the euill which i hate that do i thirdly though in the ordinarie course of their liues they do that which is good yet by reason of this combate they faile in the dooing of it rom to wil is present with me but i find no means to fulfil or accomplish that which is good euen as a sick man that is in recouerie for his affection thinkes he is able to walke a mile or twaine and yet by reason of faintnes and weakenes is scarce able to walke once or twise about his chamber so the regenerate man for affection inclines to the best things and yet by reason of the flesh failes in the dooing of them thus much of the combate the vse followes hence i gather that concupiscence or lust after baptisme in the regenerate is a sinne for the lust of the spirit is the thing that god requireth and approoueth now the lust of the flesh is directly contrarie to it as a defect or priuation thereof and therefore the lust of the flesh is properly a sinne whether consent of will goe with it or no againe hence it followes that workes of the regenerate are mixed workes that is good workes indeed yet not perfectly good but partly euill for such as the cause is such is the effect now the minde and will of man are the cause of his workes and the mind is partly carnall and partly spirituall so also is the will and therefore the workes that proceede from them are partly spirituall amp in part carnall vpon this ground it followes that all the workes of regenerate man are sinfull and in the rigour of iustice deserue damnation obiect sinne is the transgression of the law good workes are no transgression of the law therefore good workes are no sinnes i answer to the minor the transgression of the law is twofold one which is directly against the law both for matter and manner the second is when that is done which the law requires but not in that manner it should be done and thus good workes become sinfull the dutie which the law requires is done but it is not done perfectly as it ough to be done by reason of the flesh secondly it is alleaged that good workes are from the spirit of god and that nothing proceeding from the spirit of god is sinne ans things proceeding from the spirit of god alone or from the spirit immediatly are no sinnes now good workes proceed not only from the spirit but also from the mind and will of man as instruments of the spirit and when an effect proceedes from sundrie causes that are subordinate it takes vnto it the nature of the second cause hereupon workes are rtly spirituall and partly carnall as the minde and will of the doer is thirdly it is alleged that good works please god and that things pleasing god are no sinnes ans they please god because the doer is in christ and so pleaseth god againe they please not god before or without pardon for they are accepted because god approoues his owne worke in vs amp pardons the defect thereof lastly some obiect on this manner no sinnes are to be done good workes are sinnes theretherefore not to be done ans they are not simply sinnes but onely by accident for as god commands them they are good and as godly man doe them they are good in part now the reason holds onely thus that which is sinne so farre forth as it is a sinne or if it be simplie a sinne is not to be done now then vpon this doctrine it followes that there is no iustification by workes nor no fulfilling of the law for the time of this life thirdly hence it follows that the grace of god for the time of this life is mixed with his contrarie the corruption of the flesh this mixture the godly feele in themselues to the great griefe of their hearts when they would beleeue their mindes are oppressed with vnbeleefe they see more ignorance in themselues then light of knowledge there are a number amongst vs that say they know as much as all the world can teach them that they doe perfectly beleeue in christ and euer did that they loue god with all their hearts and did neuer so much as doubt of the mercie of god but these man are voide of the grace of god they are like emptie barrells that make a great sound they neuer knew what is meant by the combate of the flesh and spirit fourthly we are here to be admonished in all duties of religion to vse industrie and paines by willing striuing and indeuouring to the vttermost to doe that which we ought to doe we must vse asking seeking knocking matth we must with paul vse wrastling in our praiers to god rom they that would haue knowledge in the booke of god must doe more then heare a sermon they must striue against their ignorance and blindnes and laboriously exercise their senses in the discerning of good and euill they that would beleeue must striue against their naturall vnbeleefe and indeauour to beleeue blessed saith salomon prou is the man that feareth himselfe or inures himselfe to feare paul saith of himselfe that he laboured and tooke paines to keepe a good conscience act lastly by reason of this combate we are put in minde to vse sobrietie and watchfulnesse ouer our owne corruptions with much and instant praier least we fall into temptation matth we should practise these more then we doe for beside the enemy without we haue an enemie within that seekes our perdition and if ye be led by the spirit ye are not vnder the law in the verse paul propounds a maine rule of good life giue no occasion to the flesh and for the better keeping of this he giues a second rule v walke in the spirit of this second rule he giues two reasons the first is taken from the contrarietie of the flesh and the spirit v the second is in these words they that walke according to the spirit are freed from the curse of the law in these words paul sets downe three things the first is the office of the spirit which is first of all to regenerate and renew all the powers of the soule and secondly to guide and conduct them that are regenerate psalm in this guidance or conduction there are foure actions of the spirit the first is preseruation whereby the holy ghost maintaines the gift of regeneration in them that are regenerate the second is cooperation whereby the will of god as the first cause workes together with the regenerate will of man as the second cause and without this cooperation mans will brings forth no good action no more then the tree which is apt to bring forth fruit yeeldes fruit indeede till it haue the presence and cooperation of the sun and that in the season of the yeare the third is direction whereby the spirit of god ordereth and establisheth the minde will and affections in good duties thess the last is excitation whereby the spirit stirres and still mooues the will and minde after they are regenerate because for the time of this life the grace of god is hindred and oppressed by the flesh hereupon after regeneration there must still be new inclining psalm new drawing cant new working of the will and the deede philipp hence it follows that beside the antecedent and first grace there is necessarie a subsequent or second grace for we doe not that good which we can doe vnles god by a second grace make vs doe it as he made vs able to doe it by the first grace the second thing is the office of all true beleeuers and that is to resigne theselues in subiection to the worke of god spirit now god spirit workes in and by the word of god and hereupon this subiection hath two parts the first is to make triall inquirie and examination what is the good will of god in euery thing rom thus did dauid psalm i am thine saue me for i seeke thy commandements the second part is to denie our selues and to conforme our mindes consciences wills affections in all things to the foresaid will of god rom let all such as desire to be spirituall remember and make conscience to practise this the third is the priuiledge of beleeuers in the last wordes ye are not vnder the law vnderstand this in respect of the curse and condemnation of the law for otherwise we are all vnder the law as it is the rule of good life the priuiledge then is that god doth not impute the defects of obedience to such as truly beleeue and repent but he accepts their imperfect obedience as perfect and absolute this serues to comfort them that greeue because they feele the want of sanctification in themselues for if they can and doe will that which is good and indeauour themselues in the course of their liues according to their will let them not feare ouermuch when their obedience is defectiue because they are not vnder the rigour of the law and therefore god accepts the will and indeauour to obay for obedience and the consideration of god mercifull acceptation must stirre vs vp to an earnest care and conscience of all good duties moreouer the workes of the flesh are manifest which are adulterie fornication vncleannes wantonnes idolatry witchcraft hatred debate emulations wrath contentions seditions heresies envy murthers drunkennes gluttonie and such like whereof i tel you before as i also haue told you before that they which do such things shal not inherit the kingdom of god paul before deliuered his rule in generall tearmes giue no occasion to the flesh and fulfill not the lusts of the flesh now he proceedes further in way of declaration to make a catalogue or rehearsall of the particular workes of the flesh which were in vse and knowne to the galatians and this he doth for waightie cause for we are full of blindnes and see not our corruption and we are full of hypocrisie and therefore readie to esteeme our selues spirituall when we are carnall and therefore this catalogue serues fitly as a table or glasse to discouer the corruption of mans heart by the fruits thereof after pauls example euery man shall doe well to make a catalogue of the sinnes of his whole life by this meanes shall we better know our selues and take a manifest view of our sinnefull condition in this catalogue i consider three things the condition of the workes of the flesh the kinds of them and the punishment thereof the condition is that the workes of the flesh are said to be manifest not onely to god but euen to man that haue the light of reason and naturall conscience hence it followes that there is matter sufficient for the condemnation of them that neuer knew the gospel for though the flesh it selfe be secret and hidden yet the workes of the flesh are manifest to the naturall man and this must further admonish vs neuer to hide or excuse our sinns but freely to confesse the before god and before man also when neede requires whether we confesse them or no they are manifest and the ingenuous confessing or vncouering of them is the way to couer them psalm touching the kinds or sorts of the workes of the flesh they are in number se uenteene and i may reduce them to foure heads the first sort are against chastitie the second against religion the third against charitie the last against temperance the workes of the flesh against chastitie are foure and they are placed in the first ranke for iust cause for by them man are brought to reprobate mindes rom and to be without sense or feeling ephesians and the bodie which should be the temple of the holy ghost is made a stable and a stie for the deuill adulterie it is the incontinencie of persons married or of persons vvhereof one at the least is married or betrothed i say betrothed because one and the same punishment is designed to married and betrothed persons and therefore the sinne is like in both if adulterie which is the breach of wedlocke be a worke of the flesh then damnable is the decretall of pope syricius that marriage it selfe was the pollution of the flesh it may be obiected that young widdowes by marrying haue damnation and breake the faith of baptisme tim ans they are not saide to breake the faith of baptisme because they marrie but because they waxe wanton against christ and so marrie that is cast off the reines of obedience by committing fornication and then for to couer their offence they marrie this i take to be the right sense of that place adulterie is named in the first place and that for speciall cause for as it is a common so is it also a great sinne for it is the breach of the couenant of marriage made in the presence of god and vnto god and therefore it is called the couenant of god prou it is the punishment of idolatry rom it is a sinne greater then theft prou the committers of this sinne cut off themselues from humane societie and become man of death amp woman of death according to god law and it will neuer be well with humane societie till adulterers be made fellons their liues taken from them and their goods confiscate lastly this sinne brings the ruine of the families of adulterous persons and it sets a fire in them that burnes to destruction fornication it is the incontinencie of single persons marke how it is made a manifest worke of the flesh hence it follows that fornication is no light matter or a thing indifferent as some haue taught it may be obiected that it is numbered among things indifferent act for with strangled and blood is ioyned fornication ans the gentiles indeede esteemed it as a thing indifferent and hereupon it may be it is ioyned with things indifferent but the iudgement of the church was otherwise and this opinion of the gentiles is confuted by paul corinthian againe it may be obiected that the lord commanded the prophet ose to take vnto him an harlot ose ans it was done in type or figure and then the wordes of the lord carrie this sense take vnto thee a wife of fornications that is prophecie and publish that thou article like one that takes a wife of fornication againe if the thing were done indeede yet did not the prophet take an harlot to liue in fornication with her but at god commandement to liue with her according to god ordinance namely in marriage againe hence i gather that there is no warrant for the toleration of fornication for it is a foule and manifest worke of the flesh magistrates may not doe euill that good may come thereof rom whosoeuer doth euill must feare because the magistrate beares the sword to punish rom and the commandement of god was that there must be no whore in israel deut therefore the permission of the stewes in rome is without warrant and the rather because there the prohibition of mariage in sundrie orders of man beares sway uncleannes the incontinencie against nature as incest the sinne of sodom and such like marke where these sinnes were knowne there they are named particularly by paul as among the romanes rom and to the corinthians corinthian but where they were not knowne as in galatia there they are onely mentioned generally least by the naming of them he should after a sort teach them wantonnes that is the open profession and ostentation of incontinencie by vnchast words wanton gestures and wanton apparell hence it appeares that we are to detest all signes of incontinencie and that we are to be chast not onely in deed but also in our words gestures and behauiours the punishment of these sinnes is in v in these wordes they which doe these things shall not inherit the kingdome of god and it must be remembred that this threat or curse must be applied to euery one of these sinnes particularly the vse there are a number of man that liue secretly in these sinnes adulterie fornication ampc and because they professe christian religion and sometime come to the church and to the lord table they thinke all is well and they suppose there is no daunger thus make they a couenant with hell and death isa but they deceiue themselues for god is vnchangeable and all his threats shall be accomplished and no adulterer no fornicatour no vncleane person shall enter into the kingdome of god whatsoeuer man suppose or dreame secondly by the consideration of this threat we are admonished to flie adulterie fornication wantonnes ampc they say these are but tricks of youth belike then it is but a tricke to loose the kingdome of heauen salomon saith blessed is the man that feareth or causeth himselfe to feare prou now that shall be done when we terrifie our selues from these offences by setting god iudgements before vs lastly some man may say what shall they doe that are ouertaken with these sinnes if the doers thereof cannot enter into the kingdo of god ans their case is dangerous amp there is but one way to helpe them in the world and that is to cease from adulterie fornication vncleannes wantonnes and to doe the contrarie psalm and this will doe the deede for the promise of god is he that confesseth his sinnes and forsaketh the shall haue mercie prou and this promise of god is not contrarie to his threat for so long as man are doers of these sinnes or of any one of them they are out of god kingdom and when they cease to be doers of them and contrariwise exercise themselues in the workes of chastitie possessing their vessells that is their body in sanctification and honour the case is altered and they must no more be reputed doers of these sinnes for god accepts man not as they haue bin but as they are in that these foure sinnes adulterie fornication ampc are manifest workes of the flesh we are taught three things the first is that we must stocke vp the roote of these sinnes that is mortifie the passion of concupiscence column thess which is nothing els but an inordinate inclination to these vices and it is mortified in vs if we learne to feare god in his word and in the commandement that forbiddes adulterie for the feare of god clenseth both heart and life ioseph tempted by his mistris to follie by this meanes eschewed the offence saying shall i doe this and sinne against god further it must be remembred that without holines no man can see god or haue fellowship with him hebr and while the lust of concupiscence beares the sway there is no holines and therefore no fellowship with god the second rule is that all occasions of these sinnes must be cut off two specially idlenesse and the pampering of the bodie for idlenes consider dauid who when he was out of ciuill war and free from banishment at peace in his owne house his wandring affection carried him to commit adulterie and the israelites when they were stored and pampered with all the blessings of god gaue themselues to the committing of these offences ier corinthian and the people of sodom and gomorrha ezech the third rule is that all signes of these vices must be auoided and detested that is any speech or action that may signifie or giue suspition of an incontinent disposition as light talke wanton behauiour curiousnes and excesse in trimming of the bodie suspected company or company that may in likelihood be suspected for it is god will that not onely the vice it selfe but also the appearance of euery vice should be auoided thess idolatry the second sort of sinnes follow which are against godlines and they are three idolatry witchcraft heresie idolatry is the worshipp idol god an idol is taken two waies first of all a fiction or a thing meerely deuised is an idol againe when we conceiue a thing that is otherwise then it is it is an idol so likewise idolatry is twofold one is when some thing that is not god is set vp in the roome of god and that is done three waies one is when the godhead is ascribed to a creature as when it was said to herod the voice of a god and not of a man the second is when any propertie of the godhead is ascribed to the creature the third is when the affections of our hearts are giuen to the creature thus couetousnes is called idolatry column because it makes man put their affiance in riches the second kind of idolatry is to worship the true god with deuised worship as namely with in and at images set vp to the honour of god this idolatry is forbidden in the second commaundement as moses hath expounded the law deut thou sawest no image in the day i appeared in mount sinait therefore thou shalt make no image namely of god it is alleadged that the commandement onely forbids the making of the images of false god i answer and of the true god also aarons calfe was an image of the true god exod and it must be obserued that iehu destroied the idols of baal king and withall remained still in the sinne of ieroboam v which was to worship the calfes in daniel and bethel which were images of iehoua and for this he is discommended the vse by this we see that the roman religion is a carnall religion for it teacheth idolatry foure waies first it inioyneth man to giue to the consecrated host the name and honour of god and thus they set vp vnto themselues a breaden god made with mans hand an idol as abominable as euer was among the gentiles secondly it teacheth man to inuocate angels and saints departed and thereby it giues vnto them the searching of the heart the hearing and helping of all man at all times and places according to their seuerall necessities and these things are the properties of the godhead and therefore whether they call this inuocation latria or doulia it matters not it is flat idolatry because the honour of god is giuen to the creature thirdly it teacheth that we may put confidence in workes so it be done in sobrietie lastly it adoreth god in at and before images and so it bindes the presence grace and operation of god to them without his word papists alleadge for themselues that they intend to worship none in images but the true god i answer it is nothing that they say not mans intention but god will makes god worship let them shew god will if they can if they cannot then they must know that it is but an idol god which they worship for there is no such god in nature that will be worshipped in images but an idol of their owne braines they alleadge againe that god may as well be worshipped in images as a prince in the chaire of estate i answer the reason is not like the worship of images is religious the reuerence to the chaire of estate is meerely ciuill and in ciuill respect and according to the princes will and so is not the bowing to images according to god will let them prooue it if they can that god was worshipped before the arke we approoue of it for it was his word and will let vs heare the like word for images of god and christ and then we are readie to reuoke the charge of idolatry againe by this we see that many of vs are very carnall for though we detest outward idolatry yet the inward idolatry of the heart aboundes among vs for looke where the heart is there is the god now the hearts of man are vpon the world and vpon the riches and pleasures thereof for them we take the most care and in them we place our chiefe delight whereas god in christ should haue all the affections of our hearts witchcraft the worde properly signifies poisoning but here it is fitly translated witchcraft because all poisoning is comprehended vnder murther which followeth and the magitians of egypt exod are called in the translation of the seauentie as also the wise man daniel now if they had bin but poisoners they had not bin fit for pharaos and nabuchadnezars turne neither would they haue desired their presence and helpe witchcraft signifies all curious arts wrought by the operation of the deuill for the better conceiuing of it i will consider two things the ground thereof and the kindes of witchcraft the ground is a league or compact with the deuill it is twofold an expresse or open league and a secret league the open league is when man inuocate the deuill in expresse words or otherwise make any manifest couenant with him the secret league is when man vse meanes which they know haue no force but by the operation of the deuill and the very vsing of such meanes in earnest is an implicit couenanting with the deuill if by true faith we make a couenant with god then a false faith in the vse of satanicall ceremonies makes a couenant with the deuill and without this there is no practise of witchcraft there are three kinds of witchcraft the first is superstitious diuination which serues to tell man their fortunes or to reueale secrets by the flying of foules by the intralls of beast by the obseruation of starres by consulting with familiar spirits and such like deut the second is iuggling which is to worke wonders or feates beyond the order of nature as did the magitians of egypt the third is charming or inchanting which is by the pronouncing of wordes to procure speedie hurt or speedie helpe the vse by this we see that we are a carnall people for in the time of distresse vpon extremitie figure casting and charming are ouermuch vsed and yet both of them are full of superstition and follie for the reuealing of things to come is god and the starres are vniuersall causes working vpon all things alike and therefore it is not possible by them to foretell euents that are contingent or casuall and words haue no force in them but to signifie and therefore when they are applied to cure diseases they are abused to a wrong ende and their operation is from the deuill and for this cause they are to be auoided of christian people it may be said how may we discerne of charmes that we may the better auoid them ans keepe this rule in memorie alwaies such obseruations of whose force and efficacie there is no reason or cause either in the thing done or in the institution of god haue their operation and efficacie from some compact and societie with the deuill as for example scratching of the suspected witch is saide to be a meanes to cure witchcraft but indeede it is a charme and a practise of witchcraft for it hath no such force from the institution of god because it is against the sixt commandement and no natural reason can be rendred why drawing of blood should cure witchcraft the action therefore is a sacrifice to the deuill and in way of recompence the cure is done by him it may be said what should we doe in distresse if such helps may not be vsed ans we are to vse approoued and ordinarie meanes and for the rest namely the euent to leaue it vnto god liuing by faith and casting our care on god and quieting our hearts in his wil whatsoeuer comes to passe it is a want of faith thus to make hast for deliuerie before the appointed time and whereas it is thought that some persons haue a gift of god by words presently to cure any disease whereupon they are called wise or cunning man and woman it is false it is no gift of god but rather a curse that leaues them to be deluded by the deuill who is the worker of these cures when satanical and superstitious meanes and that in a false faith are vsed for the better conceiuing of the sinne it may be demanded what is a witch answer one that wittingly and willingly vseth the assistance of the deuill himselfe for the reuealing of secrets for the working of some mischiefe or for the effecting of some strange cure i say wittingly to put a difference betweene witches and some superstitious persons who vse charming and by it doe many cures perswading themselues that the wordes which they vse haue force in them or that god hath giuen them a gift to doe strange things such people in a naturall honestie detest all knowne societie with the deuill in that respect they are not the witches which the scripture adiudgeth to death yet are they at the next dore to them and therefore they are to be admonished by magistrates and ministers to relinquish their superstitious practises and that vpon a double ground i nothing hath efficacie but by the ordinance of god and this efficacie was either put into the thing in the creation or since by some new institution in the word and the efficacie of things that comes by any other meanes is by satanicall operation ii charmes inchantments and spells whatsoeuer haue no force vnlesse we beleeue that they can doe vs good now this faith is a false faith and the seruice of the deuill for we must beleeue nothing hope nothing doe nothing without or against the word of god if these two rules be obserued not onely charming but all witchcraft shall be banished out of the world againe it may be demanded what are the signes that serue to discouer a witch ans this discouerie is very hard for witches doe their feates in close manner not onely by foule and open cursing but also by faire speaking and by praising of things and hereupon we haue a fashion in england when we praise any thing withall to blesse it as to say it is a goodly child god saue it that our speach may not be suspected of witchcraft neuerthelesse there are fiue speciall things that serue to discouer a witch one is the free confession of the accused or suspected witch the second is the confession of the associats of the witch the third is inuocation of the deuill for that is to renounce baptisme and to make a league with the deuill the fourth is euidence that the partie hath intertained a familiar spirit in the forme or likenes of some visible creature the fifth is euidence of any action or actions that necessarily presuppose a league made with the deuill as for example if the partie shew a mans face in a glasse though he professe angelicall holines he is in league with the deuill by whose meanes the feate is wrought there are besides these other signes but they are either false or vncerten a man is sicke he suspects that he is bewitched he takes it on his death that such a partie hath bewitched him all this is nothing but the suspition of one man and therefore no proofe likewise the testimonie of some wizzard is but the testimonie of one and it is the deuills testimonie and therefore not to be receiued againe neighbours fall out threatnings are vsed in anger afterward the partie threatned is either sicke or he dies hereupon the partie that vsed threatning words is accused of witchcraft and this is the common course but great circumspection must be vsed for sicknesse and death may arise of any other causes lastly markes in the body of man and woman are vncerten signes of witches all this i note the rather because if a iudgement befall a man in his familie presently according to the common fashion he saith he is hurt by euill tongues and challengeth some one or other of witchcraft whereas his owne ignorance vnbeleefe contempt of god word and sacraments ampc are the onely witches that hurt him and pull downe god iudgements vpon him heresies the word heresie generally signifies any opinion either good or bad more specially it signifies any errour in religion thus ecclesiasticall writers take it for they condemne for heretikes such as erred in smaller points holding the foundation as vigilantius novatus ampc and the very opinion that there are antipodes was condemned for heresie though it be a matter of small moment yet most properly heresie may be thus defined it is an errour in the foundation of christian religion taught and defended with obstinacie thus paul saith tit that an heretike is peruerted that is put beside the foundation and condemned of himselfe in his sinne that is to say he erres obstinatly euen against his owne conscience i say that heresie is an errour in religion to put a difference betweene an errour in diuinitie and an errour in philosophie which is not tearmed heresie and againe to put difference betweene schisme and heresie for heresie is in doctrine schisme in manners order regiment againe i say heresie is an errour in the foundation of religion to distinguish it from errours that are in smaller points of diuinitie some teach that abraham was borne the of terah some the of terah both cannot be true yet neither of them are heresie some teach that daniels weekes begin straight after the returne out of captiuitie others teach that they must begin yeares after both cannot be true yet neither opinion is heresie so there are sundrie opinions touching ophir tarshish to which ionah fled amp decapolis in the gospel amp all cannot be true yet they are not heresies because they concerne onely times and places and other circumstances of the bible lastly i say that heresie is maintained with obstinacy to distinguish heresie amp a single error for there are three things in heresie an error in the maine doctrine conuiction of the partie touching his error and obstinacie after conuiction the vse in that heresie an error in the minde or vnderstanding is made a worke of the flesh hence it followes that the word flesh signifies more then sensualitie namely the corruption of the higher powers euen of the minde and conscience though papists teach otherwise againe if heresie be a worke of the flesh our dutie is to detest and eschew heresies and that we may for euer preserue our selues from them three rules must be obserued i we must propound vnto our selues the right principles of religion for as euery article hath his confessed principles so hath diuinitie the head and chiefe principle whereof is this all scripture of the prophets and apostles is giuen by inspiration of god this is the foundation of all true faith here is the highest stay and stoppe this principle is the demonstration of all doctrines and conclusions and it hath no principle aboue it selfe whereby it is to be confirmed as for humane reason it is no principle of religion for it is imperfect and erronious and serues onely to make man without excuse indeede in the minde of man there are certaine naturall conclusions that there is a god and that he is to be worshipped ampc but the certentie of these is in the written word we can by reason dispute of the creation of the world but a full certentie we haue not by reason but by faith in the word hebr againe the papist makes the authoritie of the church a principle for that is the first ground which they lay downe that we must captiuate our senses to the authoritie of the church but this is no principle in religion for we cannot imagine a church without faith and faith cannot be without the word of god it may be saide that scripture is the sense of the written word and this sense must be from the church ans scripture it selfe is both the glosse and the text scripture is the best interpreter of it selfe and the sense which is agreeable to the words of the text to the scope of the place to other circumstances and to the analogie of faith in the plainer places of scripture is the proper and infallible sense of scripture thus fetching the sense of scripture from it selfe we shall keepe our selues within the limits of scripture and in the matter of our saluation haue certentie of faith which we shall neuer haue if we listen to reason tradition and the authoritie of man ii read the scriptures amp be a doer of them in the exercises of inuocation faith repentance then shalt thou neuer be a heretike it is god promise ioh if ye will obay ye shall know whether my doctrine be of god or no psalm the secret of the lord is reuealed to them that feare him marke them that make apostasie and become papists they are such as neuer had a minde to loue and obay the religion in which they haue bin baptized and brought vp iii column let no man spoile you through philosophie paul doth not condemne the philosophie of the gentiles but he puts a caueat that it be vsed with circumspection as marchants vse the sea to wit in eschewing rockes and sands and pirats so students may vse the philosophie of the gentiles but they must take heede lest their mindes be corrupted with the errors thereof which are to be considered naturall philosophie giues too much to nature or to second causes and too little to god it puts downe principles flat against the word as the eternitie of the world and the mortalitie of the soule morall philosophie placeth happinesse in ciuill vertue out of christ it teacheth that vertue is a meane or mediocritie of affection whereas in true vertue there is not onely a restraint or moderation of affections but also the renouation of them by regeneration it teacheth that vrbanitie in iesting amp frumping is a vertue paul saith no ephesians it teacheth that magnanimitie whereby a man thinkes himselfe worthie of great honour is a vertue but it is contrarie to christian humilitie psalm lastly it teacheth that man hath a freedome of will in good actions which doctrine applied by the schoolemen to matters of religion is false and erronious the third head of sinnes are such as are against charitie and they are in number eight the first is enmitie of it i consider three things the first is whether it be a sinne or no for somewhat may be obiected to the contrarie obiect i psalm doe not i hate them that hate thee ans dauid here speakes of the hatred whereby he hated god enemy not in respect of their persons but in respect of their sinnes whereby they were enemy of god and this hatred is commendable and not here to be vnderstood obiect ii luke he that will be a disciple of christ must hate father and mother and his owne soule ans this hatred is not simply commanded but only in a certaine respect namely as father and mother and a mans owne soule are in comparison opposed to god and christ in regard of whome they are vtterly to be despised obiect iii rom god chose iacob and hated esau and we must be like vnto god ans we are to be like vnto god in holines and the duties thereof and not in the soueraigntie and lordship ouer the creatures whereby he either loues or hates them obiect iv it is the vniuersall nature of all creatures to flie their contrarie therefore man may hate their enemy ans man and man are not contrarie in nature or naturall properties but are all one flesh the contrarietie that is is by reason of the corruption of nature the second point is what is this enmitie ans it is a peruerse disposition of minde whereby man remember iniuries discourtesies and vnkindnesses and carrie about them a purpose and desire to requite like for like when time and place shall serue thus did esau hate iacob gen and absolom his brother amnon sam the third point where is this enmitie ans euery where among vs for we daily see person diuided against person familie against familie and corporation against corporation this shewes that we are carnall and that god kingdome takes no place among vs as it should for in it the lambe and the wolfe quietly dwell together isa the remedie of this enmitie is that all be of one mind desire and affection in the receiuing and furthering of the gospel of christ corinthian if in the maine point there be a concord in leffer matters the agreement will be easie debate it is a contention in words whereby man striue who shall shew most courage who shall get the victorie and who shall carrie away the last word no respect had of equitie or truth in this respect crying or lifting vp the voice in reasoning is condemned ephesians emulations there is a good emulation and that is when man striue to be like to them that excell in vertue or to goe beyond them and it is commanded by the holy ghost corinthian and it were to be wished that it were more common then it is beside this there is a carnall emulation whereby man that excell in any thing grieue that any should be equall to them or goe beyond them the vse if to grieue at another mans excellencie be a worke of the flesh then it is our dutie to reioyce in the excellencie of others thus did moses when eldad and medad prophecied numb and john the baptist when christ increased and he decreased ioh and paul gaue thankes as well for the graces bestowed on the churches as for gifts bestowed on himselfe anger of it i consider three points the first is whether there be any lawful anger aus yes christ in whome was no sinne was angrie mark when there is a iust cause of anger then is anger iust when there is a manifest offence of god there is a iust cause of anger therefore anger is then iust the second is when is anger a sinne ans when man are hastie to be angrie ecclesiastes and are offended at euery thing that goes against their mindes or againe hauing a iust cause to be angrie yet they keepe no measure in their anger the third point is the remedie and that is here set downe hastines is a worke of the flesh or of corrupt nature and it barres man from the kingdome of heauen and therefore it is to be auoided contention there are sundrie kinds of lawful contention as contention with the enemie in iust war contention at the barre with an aduersarie in a iust cause contention in disputation with an heretike contention in schoole disputation for exercise and trialls sake contention is carnall and finnefull in respect of matter and manner in matter when man contend for things for which they should not contend as the disciples for primacie luke or when contention is without forgiuing forbearing or suffering and that in trifling matters corinthian contention likewise is faultie in respect of manner when man wilfully defend their owne priuate causes no regard had whether they be right or wrong true or false and by this meanes they often oppugne truth or iustice or both of this kind are the war of the rebell in ireland the war of the spaniard in the low country and the suits of many quarrelsome and contentious persons among vs the vse doe nothing by contention philipp and therefore we must forgiue put vp as much as may be and yeelde of our right seditions the originall word signifies such dissentions in which man separate one from another and that is done two waies either by schisme in the church or by faction in the commonwealth question why are not we schismatiks in england scotland germany considering we haue dissented and separated our selues from the church of rome ans we indeede haue separated our selues but they of the church of rome are schismatikes because the cause of our separation is in them namely their idolatry and their manifold heresies the case is the like a man threatens death to his wife hereupon shee separates yet not shee but he makes the separation because the cause of separation and the fault is in him for the auoiding of schisme and sedition remember two rules i so long as a church or people doe not separate from christ we may not separate from them ii prou feare the king and meddle not with them that varie that is make alterations against the lawes of god and the king indeede subiects may signifie what is good for the slate and what is amisse but to make any alteration in the estate either ciuill or ecclesiasticall belongs to the supreame magistrate ennie it is a compound of carnall griefe and hatred for it makes man grieue and repine at the good things of others and to hate the good things themselues thus the high priests of envy hated christ and all his most excellent sayings and doings matth at this day they which haue any good things in them are commonly condemned for hypocrites and their religion for hypocrisie all this is but the censure of envy the vse that we may depart from envy we must loue them that feare god and loue the gifts and graces of god wheresoeuer they be euen in our enemy murthers obiect i a plant liues a beast liues and man liues the cropping of a plant and the killing of a beast is no sinne why is it then a sinne to kill a man ans god hath giuen libertie for the two first and hath restrained vs in the latter againe the life of a plant is but the vigour in the iuice and the life of a beast is but the vigour in the blood gen but the life of man is a spirit and spirituall substance thirdly man is of the same flesh with man and so is neither plant nor beast obiect ii the magistrate kills without sinne ans the killing which is in the name of god by publike reuenge is not murther and paul onely condemnes that killing when man take the sword and vpon their owne wills slay and kill by priuate reuenge obiect iii sampson is saide to kill himselfe iudg and he sinned not in so doing ans sampson was a iudge in israel and tooke publike reuenge of his enemy and in this reuenge he hazzarded his life and lost his life though he died in the execution yet his intent was not to kill himselfe but onely to take reuenge secondly his example is speciall for he was in his death a figure of christ the words matthew he shall be called a nazarite are first spoken of sampson and then applied to christ in whome was verified that which sampson figured for as sampson conquered his enemy more in his death then in his life euen so did christ obiect iu for the auoiding of some great danger or some great sinne as the deniall of christ in persecution man may make away themselues so said the donatists ans death is no remedie in this case but faith in the promise of god which is that he will giue an issue in euery temptation corinthian the vse seeing murther is a worke of the flesh our dutie is by all meanes to preserue both our owne and our neighbours liues life is a treasure for by it we haue time and libertie to glorifie god to doe good to our neighbours and to saue our owne soules the sinnes of the fourth sort are against temperance amp they are two drunkennesse gluttonie for the better conceiuing of the nature of these sinnes we are first of all to consider the right manner and measure of eating and drink of which i deliuer two rules i we may vse meate and drinke not onely for necessitie but also for delight psalm ii that measure of meate and drinke which in our experience makes vs fit both in bodie and minde for the seruice of god and for the duties of our callings that measure i say is fit convenient and lawful this is a confessed principle in the light of nature drunkennesse then is when man drinke either in wine or strong drinke beyond this measure so as there followes an intoxication of the powers of the soule and in the sinne there are two things excessiue drink and the distempering of the powers of the soule gluttonie is when man in eating goe beyond the measure before prescribed this gluttonie is that which now a daies is called reuelling rioting swaggering and it is fitly ioyned with drunkennes for there are man that vse to drinke exceedingly and will not be drunke and for all this they are not free from blame because they drinke out of measure to be giuen to drink and to loue to sit by the cuppe when there is no drunkennesse is a sinne tim these sinnes are said to be rise among vs the manner of many is to meete together and to fill themselues with wine or strong drinke while their skinnes will hold afterward they giue themselues to dicing carding dauncing singing of ribauld songs and thus they passe the day the night the weeke the yeare but we must be put in minde to detest and to flie these vices inducements to this dutie are many i god commandement keep not company with drunkards and gluttonous persons prou be not drunke with wine in which is excesse ephesians ii the punishment of drunkennes is plague pestilence famine captiuitie isai iii the example of the bruite beast that in eating amp drink keepes measure and takes no more then will suffice nature the horse and the asse may be schoolemasters to many of vs iv if we cannot forsake a cup of wine or beere which is not needfull for vs we shall neuer be able to forsake wife and children house and land for christs sake if we haue not the command of our selues in a trifle we may neuer hope for it in waightie matters v there are dangerous effects of drunkennes first it destroies the bodie for it inflames the blood with an vnnaturall heate and this vnnaturall heate ingenders vnnaturall thirst which ingenders immoderate drink whence comes dropsies consumption all cold diseases and death secondly it hurts the minde for the spirits of the heart and braine beeing the immediate instruments of the soule are by drink distempered and inflamed and hereupon arise wicked imaginations amp disordered affections and thus the devil in the roome of god image sets vp his owne image and makes the minde a shoppe of all wickednesse thirdly the vile imaginations and affections that are in man when they are drunke remaine still in them when they are sober so as beeing sober they are drunke in affection in fauour of drunkennesse it is alleadged that noahs drunkennes is remembred in scripture but no where condemned ans while moses sets downe the foule effects that followed noahs drunkennesse he doth indeede condemne it secondly his example is noted in scripture as a warning to all ages following thirdly his sinne may be lessened though not excused because he had no experience of wine obiect ii ioseph and his brother did drinke and were drunke together gen v last ans the meaning of the text is that they dranke liberally or that they dranke of the best together for the word shakar signifies not onely to be drunke in drink but also to drinke liberally or to drinke of the best drinke hag obiect iii learned phisitians as rasis avicenna and others teach that it is greatly for health to be drunke once or twice in a moneth ans as learned as they teach the contrarie and we may not doe any euill or sinne against god for any good to our selues obiect iu it is said to be neighbourhood and good fellowshippe ans it is drunken fellowship the right fellowship is in the doctrine of the apostles praier sacraments and the workes of mercie thus much of the works of the flesh now follows the punishment of the of which i cosider three things first a premonition in these words whereof i tell you before as i also haue told you before secondly the designment of the punishment in these words shall not inherit the kingdome of god thirdly the designment of the persons in these words they which doe such things in the premonition is set downe the office of all ministers and that is often to forewarne the people of the future iudgements of god for their sinnes mich isa and this may easily be done for they may know the sinnes of man by experience and the iudgements of god due to euery sinne they may finde in the word of god againe all people are warned by this often to meditate of the future iudgements of god thus did dauid psalm and paul who knowing the terrour of the lord was mooued to doe his dutie corinthian the old world neuer so much as dreamed of god iudgements before they came vpon them and so they perished matth the punishment of these sinnes is not to inherit god kingdome god kingdome sometime signifies the regiment of god whereby he rules all things in heauen and earth more specially it signifies a state or condition in heauen whereby god and christ is all things to all the elect corinthian and thus it is taken in this place and an entrance or beginning to this happie estate is in this life when man in their consciences and liues are ruled by god word and spirit it must here further be obserued that not to inioy the kingdome of god is to be in torment in hell because there are no more but two estates after this life and therefore to be out of heauen is to be in hell the vse i this must teach vs aboue all things to seeke god kingdome and to establish it in our hearts and that we shall doe if we know the will of god and yeeld subiection to it in the duties of repentance faith new obedience ii the kingdome of god comes by inheritance therfore there is no merit of good workes the persons which are punished are such as are doers and practisers of the works of the flesh marke the words not such as haue bin doers but such as are doers the word signifies a present and a continued act of doing amisse the vse here is the difference betweene the godly man and the vngodly the godly man falls into the workes of the flesh and beeing admonished thereof he repents and recouets himselfe he doth not stand in the way of sinners though sometime he enter into it psalm the vngodly man when he falls lies still in his sinne and heapes sinne vpon sinne and makes a practise of euill i warning they which are priuie to themselues of any of the former workes of the flesh must bewaile their offences and vtterly forsake them for if we be found doers of any one worke of the flesh there is no hope of saluation ii warning they which haue turned vnto god from the works of the flesh must be constant and take heede of going backe least they loose the kingdome of god but the fruit of the spirit is loue ioy peace long suffering gentlenes goodnes faith meeknes temperance against such there is no law for the better obseruing and the more easie vnderstanding of the rule in the v walke in the spirit paul here sets downe a catalogue of the works of the spirit in the catalogue i consider three things the propertie of the workes of the spirit in these words the fruit of the spirit the kinds of works and they are nine the benefit that comes by them in these words against such there is no law the fruit of the spirit it is the propertie of the workes of god spirit in vs to be called the fruits of the spirit and by this much is signified namely that the church is the garden of god cant that teachers are planter and setters corinthian that beleeuers are trees of righteousnes isa that the spirit of god is the sappe and life of them and good workes and vertues are the fruits which they beare in that the works of the spirit are called fruits therof hence it followes that there are no true vertues and good affections without the grace of regeneration the vertues of the heathen how excellent soeuer they seemed to be were but shadowes of vertue and serued onely to restraine the outward man and no further againe here we see the efficacie of the spirit which makes man fruitful or bearing trees of righteousnes psalm yes trees that beare fruit in their old age psalm here we haue cause to cast downe our selues for the most of vs are barren trees that beare no fruit but the bad fruits of the flesh and therefore we may iustly feare the curse that god laid vpon the figgetree luke and looke euery day to be stocked vp matth againe good workes are made acceptable to god euen by his grace and therefore they are called the fruits of the spirit and hence it is that they are acceptable to god rom we that are by nature wild branches must be taken out of old adam and set into christ and after our inscition draw a new sappe and life from christ namely his spirit and then our actions shall be fruits of the spirit and consequently acceptable to god lastly hence it followes that free will of it selfe is like a dead or rotten peece of wood and that it beares no fruit but as it is quickned by the spirit ioh thus much of the propertie now follow the kindes of the workes of the spirit loue it may be demaunded how it is a fruit of the spirit ans first the spirit of god workes faith then regeneration then loue tim loue follows faith because we must know first that we are loued of god before we can loue god ioh and loue follows regeneration because till the will and affections be changed there is no place for loue the papists then erre who teach that the first act of loue that is the inclination to loue god and man aright is in nature and that the second act namely the exercise of loue is from the spirit againe they erre in that they teach that charitie or loue is the formall righteousnes of a christian for it is a fruit that follows regeneration the loue here mentioned is either of god or of man the loue of god is an holy affection whereby we loue god in christ for himselfe there are three speciall signes whereby it is discerned i a desire of fellowship with god and christ and the holy spirit and therefore to be much and frequent in the vse of the word and praier because in the word god speaks to vs and in praier we speake to him ii to loue the word of god aboue all earthly treasure and to tread our owne wills vnder foote and to desire that god wil may be preferred in all things ioh there are many houses among vs where the cards and tables are walking but the bible is seldome or neuer seene and this argues the want of loue iii the loue of them that loue god and christ the loue of our neighbour is to loue him simply in and for the lord and for no other by respect the signe of this loue is to loue not in word but indeede and this is to loue indeede to shew loue and to do good when we are wronged and abused to them that wrong vs and abuse vs ioy ioy is twofold ioy of glorie after this life and the ioy of grace in this life and it stands in three things the first is to reioyce in the true acknowledgement of god that he is our god and reconciled to vs in christ the second is to reioyce in the worke of our regeneration the third is to reioyce in the hope of eternall glorie this ioy of grace hath a double fruit first it moderates all our sorrows and makes vs reioyce in the middest of our afflictions thess secondly it causeth man to reioyce at the good of their neighbours rom and this ioy is here meant specially for ioy is here opposed to envy and emulations this fruit shewes that we are most of vs bad trees for the ioyes of the world be for the most part in iniquitie and in the workes of the flesh and it is our common sinne not to reioice but to pine away with griefe as cain did when we see god blessing vpon our brother peace it is a care and desire to maintaine concord as much as may be if it lie in vs rom it is an excellent vertue for the kingddome of god stands partly in peace rom for the maintenance of peace obserue two rules i neither take offence nor giue offence abraham chose rather to lose his right then to offend lot gen and so did christ matth ii seeke to edifie one another either doe good or take good rom long suffering is to moderate our anger and desire of reuenge when many and great wrongs are done to vs it is an excellent fruit but it takes very hardly in these parts for our manner is a word and a blow a word and a stabb a word and a writte set and sow this plant in the forrowes of your hearts amp that the weede of reuenge ouergrow it not vse these remedies i god commandement forbids rash anger iam for it is a degree of murder ii the example of god who is slow to anger and of christ who is meeke and lowly math iii all wrongs done to vs by man come by god prouidence to which we are to subiect our selues iv the goodnesse of god who forgiues more to vs then we can forgiue v there is danger of god anger for vnlesse we forgiue we are not forgiuen and we craue forgiuenesse as we forgiue vi it is the dutie of loue to suffer and beare corinthian vii it is a point of iniustice to reuenge our selues for then we take to our selues the honour of god and against all equitie we are both the parties and iudge and witnesse and all viii we are often ignorant of the mindes of man in their actions and of the true circumstances thereof and so may easily be deceiued obiect i anger is a sudden affection therefore it cannot be ruled ans meanes are to be vsed before hand when we are quiet then shall we better restraine it obiect ii it is hard for flesh and blood to doe this ans we are more then flesh and blood for we haue the spirit of god els we are but hypocrites gentlenesse gentlenesse is to giue good speech and to shew good countenances euen to them that wrong vs and abuse vs without any minde or desire to reuenge rom ephesians the curtesie of the world in the cappe and the knee and all the complements of humanitie is commonly seuered from good affection and it is often the maske of enmitie and therefore it is but a worke of the flesh right curtesie is with an honest heart to blesse when we are wronged goodnesse it is a vertue whereby we communicate to others the good things that are in vs for their good and benefit it is prescribed by paul in other tearmes when he saith communicating to the necessities of the saints rom question i what are we to communicate answer the gifts of our minde our temporall goods yes our liues too if neede be ioh question ii why are we so to doe answer we are members all of one bodie and we are members one of another ephesians and it is god pleasure that man shall be instruments of good mutually one to another goodnesse respects either the bodie or the minde goodnesse concerning the bodie hath many actions as to feed the hungrie to giue drinke to the thirstie to harbour the harbourlesse to cloath the naked to visit the sicke and them that are in prison math to burie the dead sam lastly to lend freely and liberally to such as be decaied and impouerished deut goodnesse concerning the soule is to indeauour partly by counsell amp partly by example to gaine the soule of our neighbour to god and it stands in foure actions to admonish the vn uly to comfort the distressed to beare with them that are weake and to be patient towards all thess goodnes is hard to be found in these daies among man the common practise is according to the common prouerb euery man for himselfe and god for vs all the studie of man is howe to gather goods honours riches for themselues and for their children and the common good is not aimed at good orders hardly take place as namely the order for the poore and the reason is the want of goodnesse in vs if any professe any shew of goodnesse more then the rest they are sure to be despised and reproched at euery hand and this shews that there is little goodnesse among man faith first we are here to vnderstand faith towards god which is to beleeue the remission of our sinnes and our reconciliation with god in christ this faith is common to all among vs yet is it but a false dead amp ceremoniall faith in many man reason i faith comes by the hearing of the word of god preached rom but this faith in many is conceiued without preaching for they say they beleeue their saluation by christ and withall they liue in the perpetuall neglect or contempt of the publike ministerie ii true faith is ioyned alwaies with the exercises of invocation and repentance yet in many among vs this faith is without any conuersion or change of heart and life and therefore it is but a dead faith iii true faith is mixed with contrarie vnbeleefe so as they that beleeue feele in themselues a want of faith and much vnbeleefe but there are many among vs that say they perfectly beleeue and that they neuer so much as doubted in all their liues now such a faith is a vaine perswasion iv many that boast of their faith in christ want faith in the prouidence of god touching food and raiment and that is manifest because they vse any unlawful meanes to helpe themselues now if their faith faile them in a smaller point it cannot be sound in the greatest of all secondly by faith is meant faith towards man amp that stands in two things one is to speake the trueth from the heart the other is to be faithfull and iust in the keeping of our honest promise and word this faith is a rare vertue in these daies for the common fashion of them that liue by bargaining is to vse glosing facing soothing lying dissembling and all manner of shifts and with many it is a confessed principle that there is no liuing in the world vnlesse we lie and dissemble they that deale with chapmen shall heardly know what is trueth they haue so many wordes and so many shifts in this respect christians come short of the turkes who are said to be equall open and plaine dealing me without fraud or deceipt our care therfore must be to cherrish amp maintain amog vs the vertue of faith and truth reasons i god commandement put away lying and let euery man speake the truth to his neighbour ephesians ii by truth we are like to god whose waies are all truth who hates a lying tongue prou whose spirit is the spirit of trueth iii lyars beare the image of the deuill he is the father of lies ioh so oft then as thou liest thou makest thy tongue the instrument of the deuill iv eternall punishment in the lake that burnes with fire and brimstone reu here marke that liars are entertained at the same table with murderers and theeues and the liar neuer goes vnpunished prou v to speake the trueth from the heart is a marke of god child psalm and he whose faith failes towards man shall much more faile towards god meekenes the same in effect with long suffering the difference is that meekenes is more generall and long suffering is the highest degree of meekenesse temperance it is the moderation of lust and appetite in the vse of the gifts and creatures of god for the better practising of this vertue remember these foure rules i we must vse moderation in meats amp drink this moderatio is to eat and drinke with perpetuall abstinence and abstinence is to take lesse then that which nature desires and not more and that measure of meate and drinke which serues to refresh nature and to make vs fitte for the seruice of god and man is allowed vs of god and no more ii we must vse moderation in our apparell and that is to apparell ourselues according to our sexe according to the receiued fashion of our country according to our place and degree and according to our abilitie here the common fault in to be out of all order for none almost know any measure euery meane person now adaies will be a gentleman or gentlewoman iii we must vse moderation in getting of goods and that is to rest content if we haue food and raiment for our selues amp them that belong vnto vs tim here is our stint we may not desire to be rich v the king himselfe must not multiply his gold and siluer deut and yet hath he more neede of gold and siluer then any priuate man iv there must be a moderation in the spending of our goods contrarie to the fashion of many that spend their substance in sting and company and keepe their wiues and children bare at home against such there is no law here paul sets downe the benefit that comes by the former vertues the words carrie this sense against such vertues and against persons indued with such vertues there is no law and that for two causes one there is no law to condemne such secondly there is no lawe to compell them to obey because they freely obey god as if there were no law marke then the condition of spirituall man they are a voluntarie amp free people seruing god freely without constraint so as if christ would not giue vnto them life euerlasting yet would they loue him and desire the advancement of his kingdome on the contrarie if there were no hell and god would not punish adulterie drunkennes blasphemie ampc with eternall death yet would a christian man abstaine from these things because he knowes that they displease christ and he is gouerned with another spirit to which they are contrarie also these words are a reason of v there is no law against them that doe these things therefore walke in the spirit for they that are christs haue crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts the scope in these words paul prooues that which he said immediatly before namely that there is no law against spirituall man and of this he giues a double reason one is spirituall man are christs therefore there is no law against them the second is this that is crucified in spirituall man which the law condemneth namely the flesh with the affections and lusts therefore there is no law to condemne the spirituall man in the words i consider three points the first is what is a christian ans a christian is one that is christs saith paul and he is christs fiue waies i by the right of creation and so are all man ii by right of redemption corinthian iii by the free gift and donation of god the father ioh this donation is begunne in the eternall election of god and it is accomplished in our effectuall vocation iv by propagation for all true beleeuers spring out of the blood of christ and are of his bone and of his flesh as eue was of the bone and flesh of adam v by our donation in baptisme in which we consecrate our selues to god and to christ the vse this must teach vs to resigne our selues to christ and to suffer him to raigne in our hearts and to take the yoke of the gospel vpon vs but alas it is farre otherwise with many of vs for some liue in the transgression of the very law of nature so farre are they from obseruing the gospel others thinke it sufficient to follow the teaching of nature if they worship god in some generall manner if they liue peaceably and hurt no man and meane well as they say then all is well and the doing of further duties is reputed curious precisenes and such persons vsually reduce religion to the practise of nature they will be saued by faith but their faith is nothing els but fidelitie they say they worship god but this worship is nothing els but their good meaning and their good dealing these man are content that christ shall be theirs but they will not be christs and suffer him to haue a lordship ouer them ii if thou be christs then commend thy soule and life and all that thou hast into the hands of christ this was the practise of dauid psalm of christ vpon the crosse of paul tim and this practise is the onely way to obtaine safetie and protection for christ no doubt will keepe his owne iii comfort if thou be christs he will care for thee and nothing shall be wanting vnto thee that is for thy good ioh rom therefore remember this lesson neuer grieue ouermuch neuer care ouermuch neuer reioyce ouermuch in the things of this world if thou werest at thine own disposing and finding it were somewhat but there is one that cares for thee namely christ the second point to be considered is what is the flesh ans it is the corruption of the whole nature of man for the right conceiuing of this we must make a distinction of three things mans nature the faculties of nature and the corruption of both which corruption hath two parts the losse of the image of god and a pronnes to all wickednes moreouer this distinction must be without separation of nature from faculties or of corruption from either so as we may say truly that the nature and the powers of the soule of man are corrupted in the flesh are two things affections and lusts by affections vnderstand inordinate affections which shew themselues and beare sway in carnall man as anger in cain loue of pleasures more then of god in the man of the last times tim immoderate sorrow in ahab when he could not obtaine naboths vineyard king lusts are inordinate and infatiable desires after the things of this world as riches honours pleasures ampc of this sort are couetousnes gluttonie pride the lust of the flesh ampc the vse by this we see what a carnall man is namely one that is carried away with some inordinate affection or some inordinate lust herod did many good things at the aduise and motion of john baptist whome he reuerenced yet was he a carnall man for he was possessed with an inordinate loue of his brothers wife iudas a disciple of christ yet a carnall man because he was carried away with the inordinate lust of couetousnes the third point is touching the office of a christian man and that is to crucifie the flesh with the affections and lusts for the better conceiuing of this crucifying must be distinguished it is either the action of christ or our action crucifying which is the action of christ is threefold the first is vpon the crosse where christ stood in our roome and bare the burden of our sinnes and made an expiation of them in this respect we are said to be crucified with him gal the second is in vs when christ conuaies the vertue of his death into the hearts of them that are ioyned to him for the causing and effecting of the death of sinne the third is in baptisme whereby christ seales the two former to them that beleeue rom the crucifying which is our action is nothing els but the imitation of christ crucified on this manner he was first attached so must we bring our selues into the presence of god he was arraigned so must we set our selues at the barre of god iudgement he was accused so must we indite and accuse our selues of our owne sinnes at the barre of god iudgement he was condemned and so must we iudge our selues that we be not iudged of the lord after iudgement we must proceede to execution of the flesh and that is to vse meanes to crucifie it and they are three the first is by faith to applie to our selues christ crucified and that is to beleeue not onely that christ was crucified for vs but that we also were crucified with him where this faith is sinne shall no more haue domion the second is to beate downe the flesh by the sword of the spirit and that is done by a serious application of the commandements and the threatnings of god to our seuerall affections and lusts the third is to flie the occasions of euery sinne and to cut off the first beginnings of euill the vse this doctrine serues to condemne the drowsie protestant of our time who professe christ without making any change in life and conuersation for they are saints in the church but in their common dealings they are as worldlings ii secondly they are here reprooued that haue many good gifts of god in them and yet neuer proceede to a thorow reformation for they vse to cherish in themselues naughtie affections and damnable lusts there is some one sweete sinne or other that they cannot abide to crucifie iii they also are to be blamed that cannot abide to heare their owne particular sinnes to be noted and reprooued they are vncrucified and vnmortified persons and the word of god is the sword of the spirit that serues to kill and destroy the flesh iv in afflictions be content and quiet for we ought to crucifie the affections and lusts of our flesh and because we faile in this dutie therefore god himselfe takes the worke in hand and he will crucifie our corruption by his chastisements further of this dutie of crucifying the flesh there are three points to be considered i the time when this action must beginne namely in our baptisme or first conuersion therefore paul saith they that are christs haue crucified ampc ii what must be crucified ans the whole flesh with euery inordinate affection and lust this makes against them that flie and detest some fewe sinnes and runne headlong into others iii what is crucifying ans in it are two things the restraint of the exercise of sinne which is in part in ciuill man and the killing of originall corruption in all the parts and branches thereof and that is done when we doe not onely mourne for our corruptions but also hate and detest them in our selues if we liue in the spirit let vs also walke in the spirit in these words is cotained the last reason of the rule of good life before mentioned in the verse for the vnderstanding whereof two things are to be considered what it is to liue in the spirit and what to walke in the spirit touching the first life is twofold created or vncreated vncreated life is the life of god created is that which pertaineth to the creature and this is either naturall or spirituall naturall life is led by naturall causes and meanes as by meate drinke cloathing breathing amp such like spirituall life is by and from the spirit of this there be two degrees the first is when the spirit of god takes vp his habitation in man and withall gouerneth all the powers of his soule by putting into the minde a new light of knowledge into the will and affections newe motions and inclinations whereby they are made conformable to the will of god the second degree of spirituall life is when the spirit dwelleth in man and gouerneth the powers of the soule and further doth sustaine the bodie immediately without naturall means corinthian it riseth againe a spirituall bodie that is a body liuing in the second degree of spirituall life not beeing sustained by meanes but immediately by the eternall sustentation of the spirit the first of these degrees is in this life the second after this life in and after the last iudgement when body and soule shall be reunited and of the former this place is to be vnderstood to walke in the spirit is first to sauour the things of the spirit rom and that is to minde wish like desire and affect them or in a word to subiect a mans selfe to the law of god in all the powers and faculties of the soule for the things reuealed in the lawe are the things of the spirit which spirit must at no hand be seuered from the word secondly to walke in the path way of righteousnesse without offence either of god or man psalm thirdly to walke not stragglingly but orderly by rule by line and by measure for so much the word walke importeth in the originall as if paul should haue said let vs whilest we liue in this world not onely indeauour to doe some one or some fewe good actions but in the course of our liues and callings order our selues according to the rule and line of the word of god the vse this text in the first place cuts off the shiftes and excuses of sundrie persons in these daies who professe themselues to be the children of god and yet for their liues are much to be blamed because they lead them not according to the spirit but according to the flesh and these persons whatsoeuer they say doe indeed and in truth deceiue themselues and are quite destitute of god spirit for if they liued in the spirit they would also walke in the spirit it is not an idle spirit in any but it will shew and manifest it selfe in a holy and orderly conuersation you will say if such persons haue not the spirit of god what other spirit haue they ans if there life be naught they haue an vncleane spirit dwelling in them and the god of this world hath blinded their eies and makes them that they cannot see the right way wherein they should walke corinthian againe we learne from hence a true and a pregnant signe whereby to discerne whether any man hath in his heart the spirit of god or no the life of a man will discouer and proclaime to all the world before god man and angels what himselfe is if a man in the course of his life and calling be godly and vertuous leading his life according to the will amp word of god in an honest and carefull indeauour though he faile in some particulars what euer the world thinkes of him he is the man that is indued with the spirit of god lastly this teacheth what is the office of all christian people namely to walke in the spirit that is to frame and order the whole course and tenour of their liues according to the line amp square of god word and spirit a motiue to which dutie may be that fearefull threat pronounced vpon those that turne aside and walke in their owne crooked waies psalm let vs not be desirous of vaine glorie prouoking one another enuying one another the scope from this verse to the verse of the chapter following s paul handles the second rule which he had propounded in the verse of this chapter by loue serue one another in the handling whereof he first laboureth to take away the impediments of loue and then he sets downe the maner how the rule is to be obserued this verse is a rule the ende whereof is to remooue the impediments of loue in this verse foure points are especially to be considered first what the desire of vaine glorie is answer it is a branch of pride which makes man to referre all they haue or can doe to their owne priuate glorie and advancement for better vnderstanding whereof consider a little the excuses that man haue for the defence or excuse of this sinne i excuse vaine glorie in effect is no more but the seeking of mens approbation which may lawfully be done answer to seeke the approbatio of man is no fault so that it be sought in a good manner the right manner of seeking the praise of man is this a man must in this life passe through three iudgements the iudgement of god of his owne conscience and of his neighbour and the order of going through them is in the first place he must seeke for the iudgement and approbation of god in the next his owne and in the last his neighbours nowe the vaine glorious man takes another course first and principally ayming at the glorie and good liking of man hauing small or no regard of the two other ii excuse there is a good boasting which dauid vsed and that we may lawfully vse psalm ans boasting is either lawful or unlawful lawful boasting is in the lord when beeing vrged and compelled we confesse the good things that are in vs to god glorie of this read at large corinthian unlawful is when man ascribe the gifts that they haue of god vnto themselues or hauing gifts do arrogate more vnto themselues then indeed they haue or in a word doe so esteeme of their gifts as if they had not receiued them from god and this is a damnable boasting iii excuse god blessings we may seeke for and what are glorie and honour but the blessings and gifts of god ans there are two degrees of honour the first is the honour that euery man hath in his place and calling for euery calling ordained by god hath a glory annexed vnto it which beeing the gift of god it may be both sought for and enioyed the other degree is that which is aboue a mans place and calling and that ought not to be sought for euery person must content himselfe with the honour which is sorted vnto his calling neuerthelesse if god giue greater honour he may accept it but where god giues it not there it must not be desired it remaineth therefore that vaine glorie is a branch of pride wherein man principally referre all there studies counsels indeauours and gifts to the honouring and aduancing of themselues the next point to be considered is why he admonisheth the galatians of vaine glorie answer the galatians were man of vnderstanding and knowledge and were adorned with many excellent gifts now they that haue receiued good gifts of god many times are most vaine glorious corinthian math and whereas all other vices feed vpon that which is euill this vice of vaine glorie feeds vpon good things for a man sometimes will be proud euen because he is not proud a third point to be considered is where vaine glorie is to be found ans it is no rare matter for it is a common vice and spreads it selfe farre and wide some there are which neuer lift vp heart nor hand unto god at home and yet the same persons in the publike assemblies wil make as though they praied with great deuotion and what is the reason hereof but this that they are carried with a spirit of pride and arrogancie seeking the commendation of man that behold them rather then to approoue their hearts and consciences vnto god of another sort are those that haue beene old and ancient hearers of the word who notwithstanding doe little or not at all profit either in knowledge or in good life and the cause is not in the gospel or in the dispensers of it but in themselues because they receiue not the gospel for it selfe but for the praise and commedation of man and for the credit amp account they are in by reason of christian profession the last thing is the remedie of pride and vaine glorie which is the rather to be thought vpon because it is a great impediment of christian loue this remedie consists partly in meditation and partly in practise remedies in meditation are these god resisteth all proud persons and giues grace to the humble pet the reason is because the vain glorious man seeking himselfe and not god robbes god of his honour thus the proud pharisie exalting himselfe aboue the poore publican went away lesse iustified that is not approoued of god as the publican was it is the worke of the deuill to puffe vp the mind with selfe liking and conceit that thereby he may worke mans perdition gen but god worketh contrarily for he therefore abaseth man that he might in his good time the more exalt them there is no religion in that heart that is wholly bent to seeke the praise of man ioh and the man that desires to be talked of and admired by others doeth thereby in effect giue notice vnto all the world that his heart is not sound in the sight of god remedies consisting in practise are first an indeauour to acknowledge the great maiestie of god and withall our own basenesse and vilenesse before him we ought to ascribe all good things we haue or can doe to god alone and nothing to our selues for in all that befall vs god is the principall agent our selues are but tooles and instruments in his hand by right therefore the commendation belonges vnto him and not to vs in all actions and duties of religion first we must indeauour to approue our selues to god and the next place is to be giuen to man not contrariwise when we are reviled we must rest content whe we are praised to our faces or otherwise we must take heed for then satan standes at our right hand to puffe vs vp and consequently to ouerthrowe vs it is a a true saying that temptations on the right hand are far more dangerous then those on the left in the fift place pauls reason to disswarde from this sinne is taken from two euill fruits of it contention and envy prouoking one another envying one another man that are ambitious if they be crossed in their courses grow contentious if they prosper in the world then are they enuyed by others read for this purpose the historie of samuel and saul sam seeing then vaine glorie hath so badde fruites issuing from it it must teach vs to abhorre and detest it with all our hearts and on the contrarie to seeke by all meanes possible to preserue and maintaine loue in the whole course of our liues brother if a man be fallen by occasion into any fault ye which are spirituall restore such a one with the spirit of meekenes considering thy selfe lest thou also be tempted th apostle hauing finished the first part of the instruction touching the faith of the galatians in the v of the chap in the verse he comes to the second part touching good life which continues to the verse of the chap in which he first propounds the summe of his doctrine v secondly he makes particular declaration therof in the summe of his doctrine first he sets downe the ground of all good duties which is their calling to christian libertie secondly two rules of good life the first that we must not vse our libertie as an occasion to the flesh which is illustrated and handled in particular from the verse to the the second that we must serue one another in loue which is amplified from the to the v of this chap in handling whereof he first remooues the impediments of loue as vaine glorie envy ampc v secondly he prescribes the manner how it is to be obserued and practised by sundrie speciall rules the first whereof is contained in this verse where we may obserue these two generall points first the dutie prescribed secondly the reasons to vrge the performance thereof the dutie is the restoring of our brother where we are to consider foure things first the dutie it selfe restore secondly the persons who are to be restored they that are ouertaken by any offence thirdly the persons that must restore th se that are spirituall fourthly the manner how in the spirit of meekenes for the first the dutie is set downe in the word restore which in the originall signifies to set a ioynt or bone that is broken so as it may become as strong and sound as euer it was so the word is vsed matth by this we learne sundrie things first that it is the nature of sinne to set all things out of order it was the sinne of achan that troubled the iewes ios it was the sinne of ahab that troubled israel king the sinne of false apostles that troubled the galatians gal nay it driues man beside themselues as appeares in the example of the prodigall son who repenting of his sinne is said to haue come to himselfe luke small sinnes are like to slippes and slidings whereby man fall and hurt themselues but great sinnes are like downefalls for as they wound lame disioynt or breake some member of the bodie so these doe wound and wast the conscience therefore as we are carefull for our body to auoid downefalls so ought we to be as carefull nay a thousand times more carefull for our soules to take heede of the downefall of sinne or falling away from grace and as we shunne an yce or slipperie place for reare of sliding and falling so ought we to shunne the smallest sinnes and the least occasions of sinne for feare of making a breach in conscience secondly i gather hence that sinners are not to deferre their repentance nor those that are to admonish their reproofes for sinning is the breaking of a bone or disioynting of a member and reproofe is the setting of it in order againe now the sooner a bone newely broken or out of ioynt is set the sooner it is restored to his right frame and cured so the sooner a man after his fall is admonished the sooner and more easily shall he be able to recouer himselfe thirdly this shewes that it is a point of great skill to bring a soule in order and frame againe there is great dexteritie required in setting of a bone and chirurgians finde it a matter of great difficultie to set a ioynt much more difficultie is there in the soule and therefore as it is not for euery horsleach to meddle with setting of bones no more is it for vnskilfull workmen to teper with mens soules this is one speciall reason why paul saith they that are spirituall ought to restore them that are fallen fourthly hence we are taught not to woder though sinners be so loath to be reprooued and account it so painefull a thing to be restored and thinke those offensiue vnto them and skarse their friends which labour to reclaime them considering the same is to be seene in the bodie for he that hath a bone broken or out of ioynt can hardly endure to haue it touched or pointed at lastly in that s paul commands those that are spirituall to restore them that are fallen and prescribes not how often but speakes indefinitely we learne that as often as our brother falleth we must restore him for as we are not to forgiue our brother once or twise or seauen times which peter thought very much but euen seauentie times seauen times that is as often as he sinneth against vs matth so we may not restore our brother twise or thrise onely but toties quoties as often as he shall sinne against vs matth if he sinne against thee goe and tell him of his fault ampc therefore it were to be wished that as man haue a care to restore their decaied limmes so they would restore their brother being fallen into any sinne euen because they are fellow members of the same mysticall bodie the second thing to be considered is the person to be restored and that is euery one that is preuented and ouertaken either by the sleight of sathan or allurement of the world or suggestions of his owne flesh so he sinne not against the holy ghost nor openly skorne religion and discipline as peter who fell beeing ouertaken with ouermuch feare and dauid with ouermuch pleasure hence we see the subtiltie of sathan who is alwaies tripping at the heele labouring to supplant vs as also the deceitfulnes of sinne preuenting and ouertaking vs before we be aware we are therefore to be circumspect and carefull lest we be supplanted the apostle admonisheth vs to take heede lest we be hardened through the deceitfulnes of sinne hebr and that we walke circumspectly not as fooles but as wise ephesians that we walke with a right foole gal and make straight steppes vnto our feete lest that which is halting be turned out of the way hebr for as those that wrastle and t e masteries looke warily to themselues lest they be supplanted by their aduersaries so ought we much more considering we wrastle not against flesh and blood but against principality and powers ephesians againe whereas it is said if a man he ouertaken by any sinne he teacheth that no man is exempted from falling or being ouertaken and supplanted by sinne for he speakes indefinitely if a man as s john doth if any man sinne we haue an aduocate ioh this makes against the catharists or puritanes who auouch they neither haue sinne nor can sinne because they be trees of righteousnes and a good tree cannot bring forth euill fruit further hence i gather that pardon and restitution is not to be denied to them that fall after their conuersion as though there were no place for repentance or hope of saluation for paul would haue such to be restored as are ouertaken by any sinne except they be incorrigible and incurable therefore the nouatians doe erre in teaching that sinnes committed after a mans conuersion are vnpardonable cosidering there is hope in store for great and hainous sinners for though a man in persecution denie christ and renounce his religion yet he may be restored and repent as peter did luke for that saying of christ whosoeuer shall denie me before man him will i denie before my father which is in heauen matth is meant onely of a totall and finall deniall though a man be a grieuous idolater a forcerer and giuen to witchcraft yet he may be restored and find mercie as manasses did chronicle though a man be defiled and polluted with sinnes against nature yet he may be clensed and washed from them some among the corinthians were fornicators adulterers wantons buggerers but yet were washed sanctified iustified corinthian it may be saide that it is impossible that they which once haue beene inlightned and tasted of the heauenly gift ampc if they fall away should be renued againe by repentance heb ans that text is to be vnderstood of a vniuersall totall and finall apostasie and that text hebr if we sinne willingly after that we haue receiued the knowledge of the truth there remaineth no more sacrifice for sinne is to be vnderstood of a wilfull and malitious renouncing of the knowne truth as the circumstances of the place and collation of it with others doe manifestly euict againe if all sinne committed voluntarily and willingly were simply inexpiable euery mans case were damnable and though the word signifie willingly as aristotle takes it eth l c yet sometime it signifieth spitefully and malitiously as it is vsed by the seuentie exod obiect or delicta may be restored not or peccata ans they are vsed indifferently one for the other as might be shewed if it were needfull but it is a confessed truth auouched by anselme and others vpon this text lastly whereas the apostle speaketh indefinitly if any man be nertaken restore him i gather that the gifts and graces of god bestowed vpon vs ought to be vsed in restoring those that are fallen without respect of persons for herein spirituall man are debters to the wise and foolish as the apostle saith of himselfe rom the third thing to be considered is the persons that are to restore their brother laid downe in these words yee that are spirituall spirituall man are opposed to carnall as corinthian i could not speake vnto you brother as vnto spirituall man but as vnto carnall and to naturall man corinthian the naturall man perceiueth not the things of the spirit of god but he that is spirituall discerneth all things now carnall and naturall man are of two sorts either they are such as are altogether fleshly destitute of grace and godlines beeing in their pure or rather corrupt naturalls of whome s paul saith they that are of the flesh sauour the things of the flesh rom and verse the they that are in the flesh canot please god or such as are regenerate yet are weak as being but babes in christ the flesh being far stronger in the then the spirit such were most in the church of corinthian for paul saith he could not speake vnto them as vnto spirituall man but as vnto carnall corinthian for yet ye are carnall for when there is among you enuying are ye not carnall verse so spirituall man opposed to carnall are of two sorts first those that haue receiued the spirit of regeneration amp doe begin to sauour the things of the spirit rom secondly those that haue receiued a greater portion of the spirit and a greater measure of spirituall graces of whome paul speakes corinthian if any man thinke himselfe to be a prophet or spirituall of the latter the words are to be vnderstood amp by the he meaneth those whome he called perfect man philip ebr now spirituall man are more fit to restore those that are fallen then any other first because they are lesse tainted with sinne then others and so may more freely reprooue secondly because they haue more knowledge and loue both knowing how to restore and willing to doe it with greater compassion and fellow feeling he that must speak in season a word to the wearie must haue a tongue of the learned isay when peter is conuerted he must strengthen his brother luke hence it followes the more excellent giftes any man hath receiued the more he is bound to be seruiceable vnto others for if spirituall man must restore them that are fallen the more a man is indued with spirituall graces the more he ought to restore for the apostle saith as euery man hath receiued a gift so let him minister it vnto others pet this duty was practised by our sauiour christ ioh and it meetes with the sinne of many who hauing receiued great gifts and graces of the spirit are so farre from restoring those that sin against them that they scorne and disdaine to speake vnto the for if they be at variance with any the common saying is i am as good a man as he why should i goe to him let him come to me ampc these man are farre vnlike abraham who though he exceeded lot as wel in outward gifts as inward graces yet stood not vpon his priuiledge but was the first man in making the league of vnitie gen further in that spirituall man must restore their brother we learne that we haue not the gifts of god bestowed vpon vs for our selues alone but for the good of others the possession of them belongs to vs the vse of them to others lastly in that spirituall man especially the holy man of god and ministers of his word are the lord surgeans to bind vp the broken and raise those that are fallen as also his physitians to restore those that are in a spirituall consumptio of grace we ought to make great account of the amp haue them in singular loue for their worke sake thes for if we must honor the bodily physitian as syracides saith ecclesiastes verse who cureth but the diseases of the bodie how much more ought we to honour spirituall physitians which cure the spirituall maladies of our soules the fourth and last point is the manner how we must restore laid downe in these words in the spirit of meekenesse meekenes is the setling or quieting of the minde freeing it from perturbation especially in repressing the reuengeful affection a meeke and quiet spirit are ioyned together pet a notable example hereof we haue in moses who beeing prouoked in stead of anger shewed meekenes it further makes a man to yeeld of his right and not to prosecute the matter in rigour and extremitie and so it is opposed to seueritie corinthian shall i come vnto you with arodde or in loue and the spirit of meekenesse hence ariseth another propertie it bridleth the tongue and the outward man either by silence as christ being prouoked wa dumme and opened not his mouth isay was silent and answered not a word luke or by a soft and gentle answer which asswageth wrath pro there is great reason why man should restore their brother in all meekenesse for without it there is nothing but swelling and faction but troubles and tragedies againe as meekenesse is necessarie for euery christian coloss tit so it is most necessarie for him that would fruitfully and effectually reprooue hence it is that the apostle commands vs to instruct the in meekenesse that are contrarie minded tim motiues to inforce this dutie are these first the exhortation and example of christ to be followers of him corinthian who was lowly and meeke math for he wa ledde as a sheepe to the slaughter and like a lambe dumm before his shearer so opened he not his mouth isa when he was reuiled reuiled not againe when he suffered he threatned not pet as it may appeare by that meeke answer if i haue euill spoken beare witnesse of the euill but if i haue well spoken why smitest thou me ioh paul hath no stronger argument to exhort the corinthians then by the meekenesse and gentlenesse of christ corinthian secondly it is a vertue which god doth make great account of pet a eeke and quiet spirit is before god a thing much set by thirdly god hath made excellent promises to them that are of a meeke and humble spirit that he will guide them in iudgment and teach them his waies psalm that they shall be hid in the day of the lord wrath zeph that they shall inherit the earth math fourthly consider the comfortable effects amp the good that comes thereby a soft meeke and milde answer turneth away wrath prou meeke and gentle behauiour heapeth coles of fire vpon our enemy head rom a soft to g e breaketh the bones prou see the example of gideon appeasing the midianites iudg ampc and abigail pacifying dauid sam fiftly without meekenesse we cannot sauingly heare the word either read or preached iam it is further said we must restore in the spirit of meeknes the word spirit is added because it proceeds from the spirit of god who is both the worker and continuer thereof as on the contrarie the spirit of iealousie numb the spirit of errour ioh the spirit of vncleanesse zach the spirit of giddines isa the spirit of slumber isa are so tearmed because they proceede from a wicked spirit so quicke motions sudden perturbations strong affections proceeding either from the spirit of god or of satha are tearmed by the name of spirit hence we learne that the holy ghost is author not onely of meeknes but of all sanctifying graces and therefore is called the spirit of wisedome and vnderstanding the spirit of counsell and strength the spirit of knowledge and of the feare of the lord isa secondly this teacheth vs that all true vertues are wrought onely by the operation of god spirit in vs for though there be diuersities of gifts yet it is the same spirit corinthian and therfore the vertues of the heathen are but glittering sinnes thirdly that when we see the gifts or graces of god in our selues or others we returne all the praise and glory to god from whome they proceede ascribing nothing to our selues fourthly this shewes to whome we must haue recourse in our neede namely not to the virgin marie nor any saint who stand in as great neede of the fauour of god as our selues but to god alone who is the fountaine of grace ierem lastly in that the spirit is set before meekenesse it shewes that the spirit of god is present with his graces to inspire them to cherish and increase them therefore the commandement quench not the spirit thess is to be obeyed if we will retaine the graces of god thus much of the dutie the reasons vsed by the apostle to enforce this dutie follow to be considered amp they are two the first is implyed in the word brother which is of great force to perswade vs to vse moderation lenitie and gentlenesse abraham could vse no stronger argument to pacifie lot then this let there be no strife betweene thee and me for we are brethre gen moses vsed it as a motiue to accord two ebrewes sirs y are brother why doe you wrong one to another act for it is a shame that those whome nature hath so neerely conioyned should be so farre disioyned in affection but the reason beeing taken from spirituall brother such as are not onely brother in the flesh but also in the lord hauing the same god for their father the same church for their mother christ for their elder brother beeing begotten by the same immortall seede washed by the lauer of one newe birth conglutinate by the sinewes of the same faith nourished by the milke of the same word is so much the stronger by how much grace is a strai er bond then nature therefore paul would haue vs restore one another in the spirit of meekenesse because we are brethre nay persons excommunicate are not to be accounted as enemy but to be admonished as brother thess the reason why man vse no more mildnesse in their reproofes is because they forget themselues to be brother or consider not that they haue to deale with their brother as iosephs brother who considering him as an enemie said one to another behold this dreamer commeth come therefore let vs kill him gen v but when they consider him as their brother they say come and let vs sell him to the shmeelites and let not our hands be vpon him for he is our brother and our flesh v the second reason is in these words considering thy selfe lest thou also be tempted and it is taken from the consideration of our owne estate that we are subiect to fall into and to fall in temptation as well as others and therefore we ought to deale with them in all meekenes as we would be dealt withall in the like case the words are laid downe by way of admonition or aduise and they carrie a double sense either thus considering thy selfe that is looking to thy selfe lest thou also be tempted that is least thou offend and sinne in beeing too seuere a censurer of thy brother in reproouing sinne with sinne or thus consider thy selfe that is thine owne frailtie how thou maiest ea ily be ouertaken with the same the like or a greater sinne seeing thou maiest be taken in the devil snare and deceiued with his pleasant baites as well as he was therefore deale as mildely with him as thou wouldest others should deale mercifully with thee here paul forbiddeth vs not to consider the actions of our brother for we are to consider one another first that we may auoid the contagion of euill example marke them diligently which cause diuision and offences and auoid them rom secondly that we may be able to reprooue and censure them consider the matter consult and giue sentence iudg thirdly that we may follow their good example looke on the which walke so as ye haue vs for example philip let vs consider one another to prouoke vnto loue and to good works hebr but he would haue vs especially to consider ou selues that by the consideration of our owne weaknesse we might learne more mildnes towards others in our reproofes for seeing we stand in neede of mercie we ought to deale mercifully and seeing god forgiueth vs innumerable sinnes we ought to forgiue seauen times yes seauentie times seauen times seeing he forgiueth vs tenne thousand talents we ought to forgiue a hundreth pence matth obiect the pharisie considered himselfe when as he said lord i thanke thee that i am not as other man thus and thus or like this publican luke and yet he is reprooued by our sauiour christ ans true it is for he onely considered his owne supposed vertues which he should not haue considered but forgotten though they had beene true vertues indeede according to christs precept mat let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doth and pauls practise philipp i forget that which is behinde and neuer so much as lightly considered his owne sinnes which paul here would haue vs to consider and therefore he is reprooued paul would haue vs consider our selues because the serious consideration of our owne weaknes will mooue vs to practise this dutie of meeknes for as we helpe vp those that are fallen releeue the distressed pitie the afflicted burie the dead ampc because we consider our selues in them that their case may be ours so we ought to restore those that are fallen in all meekenes because we may fail and be ouertaken as well as they the rather because god himselfe in correcting and reproouing vs doth descend to our weaknes and considers that we are but flesh and a wind that passeth and commeth not againe psalm and christ became like vnto vs in all things and was tempted in like sort yet without sinne that he might be mercifull and a faithfull high priest and might be touched with a sense of our infirmities heb and obiect he therefore that knowes assuredly he cannot be ouercome by temptation is not to reprooue in the spirit of meeknes ans no man is sure and therefore no man can be secure againe though a man know he cannot totally nor finally fall away yet seeing he doth finde by experience that he cannot ouercome without much adoe without much striuing and wrastling nay oftentimes not without resisting vnto blood he ought to vse more meekenes and mildnes considering with what difficultie he ouercame our sauiour christ learned by experience how hard a thing it was to ouercome temptations that he might haue a fellow feeling of our infirmities therefore spirituall man must remember that they were once carnall euen babes in christ those that are strong must consider that they were once weake old man that are graue and staied must call to mind that once they were in the heat of their youth and what difficulty encountred them and with what contention they passed the vanitie of that age and so they shall the better reprooue others in the spirit of meeknes if they looke themselues in the glasse of their example this is pauls reason why we should shew all meekenes to all man because we our selues were in times past vnwise disobedient ampc tit lastly marke here how paul changes the number for hauing said ye that are spirituall restore ampc in the plurall number here he saith considering thy selfe in the singular and not your selues lest thou also be tempted and not you which he doth not through rudenesse of speech as some of the ancient diuines haue thought but with great iudgement he vseth a familiar hebraisme changing the number first to giue the greater force and to set the sharper edge vpon his admonition for that which is spoken to all is spoken to none secondly to shew how hard a thing it is for a man to consider himselfe it is naturall for man to spie notes in other mens eyes and not to perceiue beames in their owne matth to looke outward at others not inward at themselues like plutarchs lamiae or fayries which carried their eyes in their heads when they went abroad but when they came home put them vp in a boxe in doing good and beeing beneficiall we must not so much consider our selues philip but in iudging and reproouing we ought to beginne with our selues for the better vnderstanding of the doctrine of brotherly correction and christian reproofe i will handle these foure questions i who are to be reprooued ii for what iii by whome iiii in what manner i who are to be reprooued ans all that are brother for so our sauiour christ saith if thy brother sinne against thee reprooue him matth and s paul saith brother if any man ampc the name brethre is take foure waies in scripture as ierome hath well obserued against helvidius i for those that are brother by nature as iacob and esau the twelue patriarkes andrew and peter iames and john ii for those that are of affinitie thus the kinsemen of christ are called his brother which the helvidians not obseruing thought they had beene his naturall brother by the virgin marie thus abraham and lot are called brother gen v though lot was but his brothers son gen thus iacob the nephew of laban calleth himselfe his brother gen and so laban calleth him v iii for man of the same countrey thus all the iewes are called brother one to another deut from among thy brethre shalt thou make a king ouer thee and deut thou shalt not giue to vsurie to thy brother and rom paul saith he could wish himselfe anathema or accursed for his brother that is the iewes iiii for those of the same religion ioh we must lay downe our liues for our brother matth one is your doctor to wit christ and all ye are brothren corinthian if any that is called a brother be a fornicatour with such a one eate not to these we may adde a fifte acception for all those that are confederate or otherwise ioyned together by the bond of nature humanitie societie or friendship thus ahab calleth benhadad his brother that is his friend king thus simeon and leui are called brother in wickednes that is confederate in euill thus all man are called brother one to another by reason of the bond of nature gen at the hand of a mans brother will i require the life of man in all country those that associate themselues together in war after a speciall manner are called sworne brother now we must not restraine the word brother to those that are brother by nature or by affinitie or by countrey neither inlarge it to all those that are brother by the bond of nature but onely to those that are brother in the fourth acception that is to say brother in religion or brother in the lord though they be flase brother if they be brother at least in outward profession for reproofe beeing a part of ecclesiasticall discipline belongeth not to those that are out of the visible church as to iewes turkes pagan because our sauiour christ saith if he heare them not tell the church and if he will not heare the church let him be vnto thee as a heathen man and a publican which cannot be vnderstood of him that is a heathen or pagan alreadie and paul saith corinthian if any that is called a brother that is a christian be a fornicatour ampc and then he addes in the next verse what haue i doe to iudge them that are without that is such as are no members of the church to whom ecclesiasticall discipline reacheth not doe not ye iudge them that are within that is such as are of the visible church such as doe subiect themselues to the censure and discipline of the church it belongs therefore to those that are of the church at least in shew but specially to those that are of the same particular church liuing vnder the same particular gouernment albeit the case may so fall out that those of another church professing the same religion with vs may be reprooued and censured yes one church may admonish another for they beeing members one of another are to procure the good one of another as paul teacheth by the similitude of the head and the members of the same bodie corinthian therefore all that are in the bosome of the church euen the mightie princes and potentates of the earth are subiect to reproofe if they doe offend thus nathan the prophet reprooued dauid sam and azarias the priest rebuked vzziah chr amp paul reprooued peter to his face gal therefore those man yes those magistrates or monarchs that cannot endure the least reproofe and will not yeeld their necks to christ his yoke and their backs to therod of ecclesiasticall censure are greatly to be censured for herein they contemne the ordinance of god let the consider that they are not better then king dauid who hauing sinned patiently indured reproofe by nathan let the remember how king vzziah was stricken with leprosie for resisting god in the ministry and here the popish sort come to be taxed who exept their cleargie man as they call them fro all reproofs amp ecclesiasticall proceedings in thrusting them into some one monasteryor other lest their exemplarie punishment should be a blemish or disparagement to their order and profession whereas paul would haue the ministers and elders yes all superiours to be reprooued as well as others so it be done in order amp with due respect as after i will shewe thus paul biddeth the colossians that they should say to archippus take heed to thy ministerie that thou hast receiued in the lord that thou fulfill it coloss ii we are bound to reprooue all that are in the church to whome we owe dutie of loue but we are to loue our superiours as much if not more then others therfore we are bound to reprooue them as well as others iii there is greater reason we should reprooue them then others because they beeing in higher place are in greater danger of falling then others and therefore haue more neede of admotions and reproofes because they haue many that will flat them but fewe or none that will or dare reprooue them it will be said all are not to be reprooued which liue in the church for some be scorners who as salomon saith must not be reprooued and our sauiour christ forbiddeth vs to cast pearles before swine matth i answer that onely open scorners contemners persecuters of the word are to be excepted otherwise all wicked man are to be censured and rebuked for christ speaketh of manifest contemners of religion when he saith that they are like swine which trample pretious pearles vnder their feete and of persecutors when he saith that like dogs they returne againe and all to rend them christ beeing here vpon earth did not hinder the pharisies sadduces publicans and harlots from comming to his sermons much lesse would he debarre them of this censure of the church the woman of syrophenissa though called a dogge yet eateth of the crummes that fall from the childrens table matth paul did often admonish and rebuke the corinthians though they were carnall and fleshly minded therefore all man though neuer so publike amp notorious offenders if they be not ope scorners or persecutors of the knowne trueth are to be reprooued obiect profane man which notoriously offend and scandalize the church by their wicked liues haue no fellowship with christ but are to be accounted as dogs out of the church i answere they are not to be counted dogs which doe acknowledge their faults the greatnesse of their sinne and the merit of christ for such a dogge was the cananitish woman who was a true beleeuer this is agreeable to s pauls practise who did admonish those among the corinthians that were carnall and did not at the very first excommunicate the or yet suspend them and so answerably he commands titus that he should rebuke the cretians sharpely or pecisely for their notable lying and idlenesse tit christ denieth not pardon to them that fall by recidiuation but would haue them forgiuen not onely till seauen times but till seauentie times seauen times and paul speakes indefinitely in this place that we should restore him that falleth by occasion into any offence not specifying how often we should forgiue we must distinguish between the magistrates sword and the keyes of the church notorious offendours when they repent are to be receiued into the bosome of the church as sonnes of the church yet for all that they may nay they ought to be punished by the magistrate as the good the theife albeit a member of christ yet iustly punished for his offence ii for what faults are man to be reprooued man are to be reprooued for euery known sinne this is manifest from the end of reproofes which is the gaining of our brother that he perish not in his sinne but euery sinne is of this nature and qualitie that it bringeth death beeing not repented of therefore for euery sinne a man is to be reprooued secondly our sauiour doeth not restraine this precept to priuate iniuries because in that case we are to follow another rule resist not euill blesse and curse not doe good to them that hate you ampc thirdly it is extended to euery sin because he which sinneth against god or the whole church sinneth also against thee and euery particular member of the church for euery christian ought more to be affected for the sinnes committed against god or the bodie of the church then for those that are personally and directly intended or done against himselfe therefore christ speaketh not only of sinnes as they are priuate wrongs iniuries or damages but as they are dishonourable to the maiestie of god scandalous to the church pernitious to him that committed them not onely as they offend him against whome they are committed it will be obiected that christs commandement is to be vnderstood of those that wrong vs when he saith if thy brother sinne against thee i answer that phrase and forme of speech against thee is not meant onely of priuate wrongs offered vs as i haue said but of any sinne committed against god for in euery knowne sinne we are in a sort wronged because we ought to be so zealous of the glorie of god that we ought to be more grieued when man sin against god then when they sinne against vs yes we must make god quarell our owne quarrell because he which sinnes in our presence doth or at the least ought to offend vs as hezechiah was offended when he heard the blasphemies of rabshekah king and dauid whose eies powred out river of water because man kept not god law psalm v amp lot who vexed his righteous soule in seeing and hearing the abominations of the sodomites pet for to expound these words against thee thou beeing priuie to it is farre from the meaning of the text neither can the phrase be shewed in that sense now that man are to be reprooued for knowne sinnes committed against god of what nature qualitie and condition soeuer they be besides the former reasons it is manifest leuit thou shalt not hate thy brother in thine heart but thou shalt plainly rebuke him and shalt not suffer sinne to rest vpon him therfore a man is to be rebuked for euery sinne the apostle whersoeuer he speaketh of reproofes neuer restraines it to one kind but extends it to all knowne sinnes corinthian he reprooues the incestuous person for his incest and excommunicateth him beeing impenitent so in this place if a man be fallen by occasion into any offence he saith not this or that offence but in generall into any offence whether in life or doctrine by euill example or otherwise against the first or second table yet this is so to be vnderstood as that iniuries and wrongs offered vs are not to be excluded for euen for them also are man to be reprooued i it is the purpose of our sauiour christ matth to teach this very point for hauing taught matth v that none should offend or scandalize his brother in the verse he shewes what is to be done if any man did offend his brother by iniuring or wronging him to wit that he is to reprooue him ii he maketh him that suffered the wrong a witnesse not an accuser when he saith if he heare thee not take yet with thee one or two that by the mouth of two or three witnesses euery word may be confirmed matth he biddeth him take one or two that so it may be confirmed by the testimonie not of one or two but of two or three therefore the partie offended is one of the witnesses iii if it were unlawful to reprooue man for iniuries offered vs what course should he take that is secretly wronged none beeing priuie to the wrong but himselfe and the partie offending thus man would be imboldned to sinne seeing they could by no meanes be controlled and so man might frustrate the commandement of christ i adde further that he which is iniured is fitter to reprooue him that offered the iniurie then any other i because the offence both for stance and circumstance is better knowne vnto him then to any other ii because the reproofe in all likelihood will take the better place when as the offender shall haue coales of fire heaped vpon his head when he shall see that the partie wronged is desirous of his good and readie to requite good for euill in seeking his amendement whereas he sought his hurt and whereas it may seeme that it sauoureth of reuenge to reprooue those that wrong vs i answer though many in reproouing reuenge themselues yet the one may be done without the other and the right vse of a thing is not to be neglected because of the abuse thereof obiect authors of heresies schismes dissentions are to be auoided rom therefore not to be reprooued ans generall places of scripture are to be expounded according to particular limitation in other places now that generall text rom is restrained and limited tit auoid an heretikeafter once or twise admonition obiect paul commands the corinthians that without any more adoe they should proceede forthwith to the publike censure of excommunication against the incestuous person and as it may seeme without any former reproofe corinthian besides he commands that we should not eate that is familiarly conuerse with notorious persons of scandalous life corinthian and that we should withdraw our selues from euery brother that walketh inordinately thess ans pauls practise is not contrarie to christs precept he purposed indeede to excommunicate the incestuous person if he persisted in his sinne yet marke how in the name and by the power of our lord iesus christ corinthian in which words the forme of proceeding against him is limited and that according to christs institution matth the name and power of christ signifying the word and institution of christ paul doth plainly expound himselfe in other places what his practise was in that behalfe as corinthian where he signifieth that he did not excommunicate vncleane persons fornicators wantonnes mentioned chap before the third admonition making his third comming vnto them in stead of three admonitions or witnesses against them it will be saide that paul threatneth when he commeth he will not spare the rest corinthian therefore it seemeth he was resolued to excommunicate them without any former proceeding against them ans when paul saith i write to them which haue sinned and to all others that if i come againe i will not spare by all others he meaneth not some which he purposed to excommunicate without former admonition for in writing this epistle to them he admonisheth them all to repent least when he came he should vse seueritie but those which liued securely in the open breach of the law to whome he threatned to come with a rodde if they did not amend corinthian and when he now againe admonisheth threatning that if he come the third time he will not spare besides this paul should be vnconstant and vnlike himselfe if he should admonish vncleane persons fornicatours wantons and that three times before excommunication and should at the first excommunicate certen others without any precedent admonition the word there vsed signifieth reproofe in word as it is taken luke if thy brother sinne against thee rebuke him therefore the reproofe by many or of many mentioned corinthian may signifie as well the graue serious and effectuall reproofe of the church by which the incestuous person was reclaimed from his sinne and so preuented the thunderbolt of excommunication as the reall election out of the church and those words v if you forgiue any thing may as well signifie receiuing into fauour and familiaritie before excommunication vpon his repentance as restitution after excommunication be it grounted he were indeede excommunicate as it is most probable he was yet hence it cannot be inferred that they did proceede against him without precedent admonition the scripture is silent in this point therefore the reason is not good it is not recorded therefore it was not practised though the apostle command we should haue no familiaritie with inordinate liuers thess but that we withdraw our selues from them yet he addes withall that if there were any amongst them that would not obey his sayings they should note him by a letter v and he expressely commandeth that they should admonish the inordinate thess for that was his practise as it may appeare thess those that are such that is inordinate liuers we exhort amp comand by our lord iesus christ that they worke with quietnes and eate their own bread iii who are to reprooue it is dutie which concerneth all man our sauiour christ saith if thy brother sinne against thee reprooue him and the commandement is generall leuit thou shalt not hate thy brother in thy heart but shalt rebuke him plainely now all christians are brethre as i haue shewed therefore all man are bound to reprooue their brother as occasion shall serue secondly all christians are members of the same bodie whereof christ is the head therefore they are to helpe and further one another as members of the naturall bodie doe and this is done by admonition and reprehension thirdly the bond of charitie t th all man to helpe their brother in what they can for their good and therefore if neede be to reprooue them and albeit some may seeme to be vnfitte or vnworthie reproouers of others beeing tainted with as great or greater sinnes themselues and so cannot cast out motes out of other mens eyes they hauing beames in their owne yet we must know that sinne freeth none from this dutie indeede none ought to reprooue either with scandall to others or with hurt and hinderance of him that is reprooued yet no man is exempted from this dutie for euery man ought to be cleare and blameles specially of open crimes that so he may more freely and fruitfully reprooue his neighbour but though he be not yet he remaineth still bound to the performance of this dutie our sauiour saith not that he which hath a beame in his eye is therefore freed from pulling forth the mote out of his brothers eye but first cast out the beame out of thine owne eye and then thou shalt see to pull out the mote out of thy brothers eye they therefore are seuerely to be censured nay deepely to be condemned who say with cain am i my brothers keeper as though it concerned them not a whit whether he sinke or swimme as though euery man were to looke to himselfe alone for his owne behoofe and benefit and not vpon the things of his brother for their good or as though god had not made euery man a guardian to his brother the dimme candle light of corrupt nature condemneth these man which teacheth that he which may saue and doth not doth in effect as much as kill or destroy the dutie therefore lieth vpon all but chiefely vpon the pastours and ministers of the word for they are to inquire into the liues of man specially of those that are committed and commended to their charge for which cause they are called the lord ouerseers or watchmen ezech and and if they doe not strengthen the weake heale the sicke bind vp the broken bring againe that which was driuen away nor seeke that which is lost ampc he will require his sheepe at their hands ezech v paul inioynes the pastours of the church of ephesus that they should take heede to themselues and to the flocks whereof the holy ghost had made them ouerseers act and he commandeth timothie that he should be instant in season and out of season that he should improoue rebuke exhors with all long suffering and doctrine tim and titus that he rebuke and exhort with all authoritie tit further it is to be obserued that though all man are bound to reprooue their neighbours if they offend yet in fiue cases they are not bound i if a man be ignorant of the offence for a man that reprooueth another must be certen of the fault otherwise he doth purchase to himselfe a blot and priuate persons are not to prie into others mens actions that so they may haue matter to reprooue prou for we are bound to reprooue as we are bound to giue almes now we are not bound in giuing almes to seeke some to whome we may giue if we giue to those whome we meete that stand in neede of our almes we haue done our dutie the like is in reproofes and although reproofe be a debt which we owe our neighbour yet it is no debt due to any priuate person for then we were bound to search out the par e and discharge the debt but it is a publike debt which we owe to all and therefore it is not necessarie we should seeke them out if we discharge it to those we meete withall it is sufficient s augustine saith well admonet dominus non negligere invicem peccata nostra non quaerenda quod reprehendas sed videndo quid corrigas ii if he haue repented of his fact he is not to be reprooued for the end of reproofe is to reclaime him therefore if he be reclaimed already there is no place left for reproofe although the magistrate may punish and correct him in regard of the common good iii a man is not to reprooue if he be certaine his reproofe will doe no good for when the ende ceaseth all things teding to the end do likewise cease therfore if there be no hope of amendment which is the ende of reproofe reproofe is to be omitted specially if it be so farre from bettering the partie that it make him much worse salomon saith he which instructeth a scorner getteth himselfe reproach and he that reprooueth a wicked man purchaseth to himselfe a blotte prouer and then he addes in the next verse rebuke not a scorner least he hate thee rebuke a wise man amp he will loue thee and verely it were great folly to spend labour in vaine in telling them of their faults when out schooling will not better them but incense them more and more it were better to be silent or to separate from them then to stirre vp hornets or to thrust our hands into a wasps neast it is is well said of one that he which shall bestowe the seed of wholsome admonitions on such cursed and vnprofitable ground shall reapt nothing for his paines but the thornes of mockes and reproches it will be said the iudge ceaseth not to punish malefactours though they be not bettered by the punishment therefore seeing brotherly correction is commanded it must not be omitted though the party reprooued be not bettered but offended thereby and made worse i answer the reason is nothing like for the iudge in punishing doth principally intend the good of the common wealth which commeth by chastising or by cutting off malefactours though they themselues be nothing bettered but the end of reproofe is the amendment and good of him that is reprooued therefore a man may not be reprooued except it be for his priuate good though the magistrate may punish him in regard of the common good iv reproofe may be omitted if it be certaine that the parsie will either presently redresse his fault without reproofe or that some others will admonish him thereof whome it doth more neerely concerne as the giuing of almes may be omitted if it be certaine that the partie that is in want will prouide for himselfe or that he will be sufficiently releiued by others v if it may be done more conueniently and profitably another time it may be omitted for the time except in these fiue cases he that doth not reprooue his brother is guiltie of his sinne leuit iiii point in what manner are man to be reprooued the manner to be obserued in reproouing i will lay downe in tenne rules i a man must so reprooue his brother as that it may be most for the advancement of god glorie best for the winning of him to god and least to the defaming of him abroad to the world and that it may appeare vnto him that he doth it of loue aiming at nothing but his good not of any malitious humour or si ister affection of reuenge or vaine glorie ampc and that this may be done two things must be practised first he that reprooueth another must pray that god would so guide his tongue and mooue the others heart that his reproofe may be profitable vnto him for without god blessing our admonitio s are but words spoken in the winde john v if any see his brother sinne sinne that is not vnto death let him pray ampc secodly we may not traduce him to others either before or after our reproofe pet this rule is generall the rest following are more speciall ii euery reproofe must be grounded vpon a certaine knowledge of the fault committed for we may not goe vpon priuate surmises and supposes or flying reports and rumours blazed abroad no nor vpon vehement suspitions or strong presumptions deut v for in so doing we shall but offend the partie who knowes himselfe to be innocent of the crime obiected and purchase to our selues a blot of indiscretion in beeing zealous without knowledge therefore for secret sinnes man are not to be reprooued secret i call those that are knowne onely to god and the conscience of the doer or onely to others but not to vs this was practised by s paul gal who reprooued not peter till he was throughly informed of his offence which condemnes the common practise of the multitude who censure and reprooue others specially publike persons as magistrates and ministers vpon false reports or wicked surmises when as no accusation may be admitted against such vnder two or three witnesses tim yet a man may reprooue vpon credible information as paul did the corinthias for their cotentions grouding his reproofe vpo the report of the house of clo corinthian which he beleeued to be true in part corinthian if the report be not certaine we must onely reprooue hypothetically and not pereptorily iii in reproouing others we must consider our selues specially our owne weakenes and beginne the reproofe in our selues if not for the same fault we reprooue in our neighbour yet for as great as that if not a greater in another kind this manner of reproouing is inioyned by s paul when he saith considering thy selfe le t thou also be tempted and a man is to consider himselfe in three respects in regard of the time past present and to come in regard of the time past that he was as wicked prophane and gracelesse as another yes that he was as the apostle speaketh darkenesse and the child of wrath as wel as others paul shewes the force of this consideration when he perswades man to be softe and gentle shewing all meekenesse to all man a reason taken from the consideration of our own frailties and sinnes in time past for saith he we our selues also were in times past vnwise disobedient deceiued seruing the lusts and diverse pleasures liuing in malitiousnesse and envy hatefull and hating one another tit v in regard of the time present that he is but a fraile man ready to fall euery moment that he is not able of himselfe to thinke the least good thought much lesse to resist the least temptation and that whatsoeuer he is he is it out of himselfe by grace in christ as paul saith by the grace of god i am that i am so that were it not for this preuenting and cooperating grace he would fall into as great enormities as other man in regard of the time to come consider thy selfe lest thou also be tempted remember pauls item corinthian v let him that thinketh he standeth take heed l st he fall for if thou hast not bin ouertaken with the like sinne yet thou maist be hereafter therfore as thou wouldest haue others to be copassionate towards thee if thou were in the like case so be thou to the the not obseruace of this rule is the cause that there are so many censorious cato so many seuere aristarchi of other mens actions so many that are sharpe sighted amp eagle eied in spying motes in other mens eies and as blind as moles or beetles in discerning the great beames that are in their owne eies iiii it is very requisite and expedient that the reproouer be not tainted with the same or the like fault which he reprooueth in an other least it be said vnto him physitian cure thy selfe luke in that thou iudgest another thou condemnest thy selfe rom v therefore dauid saith not let the wicked sm e me or let him that is as deep in fault as my selfe reprooue me but let the righteous smite me for that is a benefit and let him reprooue mee that shall be as a pretious o le that shall not be wanting to my head psalm v for albeit in regard of the reproofe it selfe it be not greatly materiall yet it is not so expedient nor so profitable in regard of the reproouer because he seemeth vnworthy to reprooue another who is to be reprooued himselfe beeing as deepe in fault as any because it will be thought that he which maketh no conscience to redresse himselfe will not be so ready to reclaime others of loue to their persons or hatred of their sinnes or zeale of god glorie but for pride or businesse in other mens matters or vanitie or some such sinister ends v all reproofes must so be ministred as that the partie reprooued may be brought to a true sight of his sinne as also to a liuely sense and feeling thereof and so to a compunction of heart by reason of it and of the wrath of god which attendeth vpon him for his sinne for the performance of this rule we haue the example of god himselfe psalm v i will reprooue thee and set thy sinnes in order before thee as also of the prophet nathan who by the parable conuicted dauids conscience and so made him condemne himselfe sam and the precept of saint paul commanding timothie that he should so reprooue as that he conuict the conscience of the sinne when he saith reprooue rebuke exhort with all long suffering and doctrine nowe this is done by shewing the true meaning of the lawe and the curse of god annexed to euery breach thereof and so by vnfolding the horrible greatnesse of sinne to the conscience of him whome we doe reprooue for reproofes which are not thus qualified are but cold and perfunctorie such as was that of elie in reproouing his lewd sonnes why doe ye such things for of all this people i heare euill reports of you doe no more my sonnes for it is no good report that i heare sam v beeing a meanes rather to cherrish sinne in them then to reclaime them from it these kinds of reproofes not vnfitly may be compared to hotte or hastie healing salues which drawe a faire skinne ouer a fowle wound which because it is not soundly cured from the bottome but ouerly healed vp doth afterward apostemate or fistula e and becommeth more dangerous and desperate then euer before vi the vineger of sharpe reprehension must be allaied and tempered with the oyle of milde and gentle exhortation we may not onely vse the corrasiues of th lawe but withall we must apply the cordialls of the gospell bitter pilles of reproofe must be sugered ouer with louing and affectionate perswasion lest the patient abhorre the physicke euery man in this case is to follow the skilfull surgeon who doth not alway vse section and vs ion in launcing the wound with sharpe instruments but mollifying ointments and mundifying water to clense and supple the wound and heale the sore paul saith that the servant of the lord must be gentle toward all man and that he must instruct with meekenes them that are contrarie minded tim and in this place he commands the galatians that they should restore their brother with the spirit of meekenes the word translated restore is very emphaticall for it signifieth to set a bone that is broken or any member of the bodie that is out of ioynt and therefore we are to deale with a man that is fallen and by his fall hath di onyted some member of the new man as the surgeon doth with an arme or a legge that is broken or out of ioynt to handle it tenderly and gently so as it may be most for his good and least for his paine more particularly this may be done foure waies when a man doth propound the reproofe in his owne person as paul did corinthian now these things brother i haue figuratiuely applied vnto mine owne selfe and apollos for your sakes that ye might learne by vs that no man presume aboue that which is written ampc when a man doth not directly reprooue another in plaine tearmes but closely shewes a mislike of the fact and conuaieth a reproofe in an exhortation and so lappeth vp pills as it were in sugar as when a man sweares not alwaies to say thou ampc but yes and nay shall serue between vs what needes this vehemencie between vs two i will as soone take your word as your oath ampc when the reproofe is propounded in a parable as nathan dealt with dauid sam and as our sauiour christ by the parable of the two sonnes reprooued the pharisies matth when we reprooue a man directly as at the length nathan did dauid thou article the man sam we must so carrie our selues as that the partie may see himselfe rather reprooued by god then by vs and not to proceede bluntly to worke to rebuke and censure at the very first but to vse some preface before hand as that we doe that which we doe in loue of his person for his good wishing him well both temporally the reputation of his name and eternally the saluation of his soule and that we consider our selues herein how that we may easily be ouertaken as he was these cautions obserued the inferiour may reprooue his superiour as king vii euery reproofe must be fitted to the qualitie and condition of him whome we reprooue and to the nature of the offence for which he is reprooued we shall fit the reproofe to the person reprooued if we consider that a man may reprooue another foure waies first by friendly admonition and thus one equall is to reprooue another secondly by reuerent and submisse exhortation thus the yonger must reprooue the elder the inferiour their superiours it is god commandement that we should not rebuke an elder but exhort him as a father tim and thus kings and great potentates are to be reprooued they beeing patres patriae that saying of the philosopher hath place in this case thirdly by sharpe reprehension thus elders or superiours are to reprooue their inferiours specially if the fact be notorious scandalous or dangerous paul commandeth titus that he should rebuke the cretian sharpely that they might be sound in the faith tit fourthly by due chas isment and correction thus the superiours must reprooue their inferiours ouer whome they are set as the father the child the master the servant the magistrate the subiect ampc and thus the inferiour cannot reprooue his superiour nor one equall another though he doe it with neuer so great mildnes secondly we shall fit our reproofe to the offence committed if in spirituall wisdome and discretion we put a difference between sinne and sinne as the apostle teacheth vs iud v haue compassion on some in putting difference and other saue with feare pulling them out of the fire sinnes committed of humane frailtie or through ignorance must be distinguished from those of malice of pride and presumption both must be reprooued yet after a different manner for the one must be wonne with gentlenes the other with sharpnes the one with lenitie the other with seueritie to the one we must come with the pleasant pipe of christ to the other with the lamentation of john baptist to the one in the spirit of elijah to the other in the spirit of moses when gentle admonition would take no place christ thundreth out threats against corazin and bethsaida and paul threatens seueritie when lenitie will doe no good corinthian viii euery reproofe must be administred in fitte time when we may doe the most good therefore if in wisdome we shall foresee fitter opportunitie to winne our brother we are to take that time and to omit the present not to tell him of his fault beeing drunke or in the heat of his passion but after when he commeth to himselfe as abigail dealt with nabal sam for the commandement of god touching reproofe beeing affirmatiue bindeth not to all times but onely to that which in spirituall discretion we shall iudge the fittest both to reclaime him and saue his credit salomon saith that a word spoken in due time is like apples of gold with pictures of siluer prou now if this be true of a word spoke in due time it is much more true of a reproofe deliuered in due season there is a time for all things ecclesiastes and surely if euery thing that commeth to passe in the world haue his set time and opportunitie reproofe must needes haue his time and season ix secret sinnes knowne onely to thee or to a few must be reprooued secretly between thee and the partie alone they must not be divulged but concealed in loue which couereth a multitude of sinnes for if thou hast offended or if thy brother hath ought against thee goe thy way and be reconciled to thy brother matth if he haue trespassed against thee or thou hast ought against him goe and tell him his fault betweene him and thee alone matth and albeit salomon say that open rebuke is better then secret loue prou yet it makes nothing against this rule for he vnderstandeth not that reproofe which is vttered before witnesses but that priuate reproofe which is giuen to his face and not behind his backe between the two alone but open sins are to be reprooued openly tim them that sinne rebuke openly that the rest also may feare which text of scripture must rightly be conceiued for it is not a generall commandement giuen to all as some haue thought in alleadging it to prooue that they may lawfully reprooue open swearers and offenders and that openly but it is a special comandement giuen to the pastors or gouernours of the church that they should reprooue those elders and so consequently all such as were conuicted of any crime by witnesses and that before all man that is before the whole church and not before all man in euery place and assemblie where they offend for we haue no warrant in scripture so to doe secondly this open disgracefull rebuking of man will rather harden them in their sinnes then any way reclaime them from sinne augustine saith well prae pudore incipiet defendere peccatum suum amp quem vis correctiorem facis peiorem thirdly they might as well say a man is to be reprooued for euery sinne and that openly before all man as for open sinnes because paul saith not them that sinne openly rebuke before all man but them that sinne rebuke openly fourthly the wordes depend vpon the former verse where it is said receiue not an accusation against an elder vnder two or three witnesses and then it followes those that sinne rebuke openly that is those elders that sinne and haue beene first priuatly admonished and after that before witnesses if they be accused by two or three witnesses then reprooue them openly before all man that is before the whole church x we must carefully obserue the order set downe by our sauiour christ matth first we must trie whether by priuate reproofe our brother will be reclaimed or no if he be we must proceede no further for then we haue attained the maine end of all reproo es if he heare thee thou hast wonne thy brother if not we must take one or two which may witnesse the fact and that for sund ie causes the first is giuen by saint hierom vpon the place that they may witnesse that to be a sinne for which he is reprooued and that he is worthily reprooued for the same the second is laid down by saint august epistle to conuince the partie offending of the act comitted if he should iterate the same againe the third by chrysostom homily in matth to witnesse that he which reprooues hath discharged his dutie and done what in him lay to win his brother if he be reclaimed at the second reproofe before witnesses we must proceede no further but rest there as before if not we must relate it to the church if he heare the church there is no further proceedings to be vsed if he heare not the church he is to be excommunicated and holden as a heathen offenders therefore are not to be excommunicated at the very first but orderly to be proceeded against and louingly to be dealt withall and patiently to be endured according as the apostle commandeth tim reprooue with all long suffering it may be obiected that paul biddeth titus he should auoyd an hereticke after once or wise admonition tit therefore we are not to proceed against offenders according to christs commandement ans that text makes nothing against this orderly proceeding commended vnto vs by our sauiour christ for first this commandement is not giuen to all but onely to the pastors as here to titus or bishops who representing the whole church are to giue sentence of excomunication secondly it is to be vnderstood of publike admonition in the face of the church after that the partie hath bin priuately dealt withall and if after this admonition he doe not reca t his errours and reforme himselfe then is he to be reiected as an heretike that is condemned of his owne selfe tit neuerthelesse there be certaine cases in which we are not bound to followe this order or manner of proceeding in our reproofes and they are principally three i when the sinne committed tendeth to the hurt of the church or common wealth and there be danger in delay as also danger to the partie that is priuie to it and doeth not detect it and small hope of hindering of it as when a man doth plot treason or intermedleth in treasonable practises in this case the pa tie offending is not first priuately to be reprooued but publikely to be detected and so to be dealt withall of the magistrate according to the nature and qualitie of his offence for the common good is to be preferred before any one mans priuate good better it is that one man perish then that the bond of vnitie should be broken ii when the fault is greater if it be committed then the losse of his credit that committed it though it be published for example if one intend to slay another and lie in waite for him in this case we are not bound priuately to admonish the partie intending murther or bloodshed but to detect him to the magistrate for his life is to be preferred before the mans credit that sought his life when pauls kinsman to wit his si sters son heard that aboue man had conspired together and bound themselues with an oath that they would neither eate nor drinke till they had killed paul he doeth not goe and reprooue them for this fact but relates it to paul and paul hearing of it doth not counsell him to goe and reprooue them first and if they would not harken to him to take two or thee witnesses ampc but sent him straight to the cheife captaine that he might take order to preuent their bloodie attempt iii when a man is assured priuate reproofe will doe no good and that the partie offending will not brooke it nor take reproofe at his hand he is not to followe that order and manner of reproofe but to acquaint them with it that can and will redresse it thus ioseph as it may seeme did not reprooue his brother because he knewe well they would not be bettered by him seeing they hated him but he brought vnto his father their euill sayings gen albeit others say that their sinne was publike and therefore needed no priuate admonition and others that he did admonish the secretly before he did relate it to his father althogh it be not expressely set down in the text howsoeuer this example be vnderstood the rule is certaine that priuate reproofe is to be omitted when it will either doe hurt or no good beare ye one anothers burdens and so fulfill the lawe of christ in this verse the apostle propounds another rule touching brotherly loue and it dependeth vpon the former as an answer to a secret obiection which might be made vpon the former doctrine in the verse in this manner thou enioynest vs we should restore our brother if he fall by occasion into any sinne in the spirit of meekenesse but there are some infirmities in our brother which cannot be amended nor redressed by brotherly correction what is to be done in such a case the apostle answereth such infirmities must be borne and tollerated in these words beare ye one anothers burdens and this rule is enforced by an argument taken fro the excellencie therof in that the practising of it is the keeping and fulfilling of the whole law in these words and so fulfill the lawe of christ first for the rule the apostle calleth slippes infirmities amp sinnes by the name of burdens taking his metaphor from trauellers who vse to ease one another by carrying one anothers burde either wholly or in part that so they may more cheerefully and speedily goe on in their iourney mens burdens are of two sorts either such as euery man is to beare by himselfe alone without shifting them off his own shoulder and laying them vpon other man of which we are to intreat when we come to the fift verse or such as may be borne of others as well as of our selues of these the apostle speaketh in this place when he saith beare ye one anothers burdens and there are foure sorts of them first those whereof our brother may either be wholly disburdened or in part eased such is the heauie burden of pouertie sickenesse nakednesse hunger thirst banishment imprisonment ampc secondly the outward and bodily wants that are in sundrie persons as blindnesse deafenesse maimednesse lamenesse ampc thirdly personall or actuall sins of man as anger hatred iealousie envy ampc lastly outward frailties in the actions of mens liues which are not felt oftentimes of those that are subiect vnto them but are heauie burdens to others with whome they conuerse as curiousnesse nicenesse flownesse selfe conceitednes frowardnes hastines and such like the two first forts are to be borne three waies first by hauing a holy sympathie and fellow seeling of them in weeping with those that weep and in remembring those that are in bonds as though we were bound with them those that are in affliction as if we were also afflicted in the bodie ebr v this was pauls practise corinthian who is weake and i am not weake who is offended and i burne not secondly by bearing with them in their wants and infirmities according to that of the apostle beare with the weake thes thirdly by putting vnder our shoulders and bearing part of the burden with them in helping and easing of them in their necessities rom v distributing vnto the necessities of the saints the two latter sorts beeing principally meant in this place are not to be borne by dissembling of them or yeelding to them much lesse by bolstering man vp in them or by partaking with the for albeit the adulterer and vncleane person would gladly make christ a baud the theife would make him his receiuer and many there are who would be content to shift off their sinnes in whole or in part and lay them vpon the shoulders of others yet in god cause and quarrell in matters of faith we are not to yeeld a haire breadth moses told pharao that he would not leaue so much as a hoofe behind him exod and paul would not giue place to peter and them that were with him no not for a moment that the truth of the gospel might continue with them gal they must therefore be borne by disburdening the of the by gentle amp mild admonitio or if they cannot be redressed by bearing amp tollerating of them in passing by them as though we did not perceiue them for as salomon saith it is the glorie of a man to passe by infirmitie or lastly by praying for them for if we shall breake the bond of brotherly loue and christian societie by reason of these or such like infirmities which we see to be in our brother we walke not in loue in that we beare not their burdens as the apostle commandeth in this place and ephesians support one another through loue and surely this is a most necessarie precept of great vse and consequence in the life of man for except we beare and tolerate the frailties of man in passing by them in such sort as i haue said it is impossible we should lead a quiet or comfortable life in any societie we must seeke for a new world or leauing the fellowship of man betake our selues to some solitarie desert as sundrie eremites and anchorites haue done because they could not by reason of their froward and wayward natures digest the manifold inconueniences which they saw to be amongst man in publike societies this dutie therefore of bearing one anothers burdens albeit it be difficult yet it must be practised specially of those that are strong man in christ for as in architecture all stones are not fit to be laid in euery place of the building but some below as the fundamentall and chiefe corner stones to beare vp the waight and burden of the building others aboue in the wall that so the whole building may be firme and compact in it selfe so in the church which is the house of god where all beleeuers are liuely stones built vpon christ iesus the chiefe corner stone bearing vp the whole burden euen all the infirmities of the church those that are strog must support the infirmities of the weake that so the whole building beeing compact and knit together may growe vp to a holy temple in the lord for otherwise the whole frame of the building must needs be dissolued and come to ruine it is a common prouerbe among the italians that hard with heard neuer makes a good wall by which is signified that as stones cobbled vp one vpon another without morter to combine them make but a tottering wall that may easily be shaken but if there be mor er between them yeelding to the hardnes of the stones it makes the whole like a solide continued bodie strong and stable able to endure the shocke of the ramme or the shot of the cannon so that societie where all are as stiffe as stones which will not yeeld a haire one vnto another one beeing as fast as froward as hastie as another cannot be firme and durable but where man are of a soft a yeelding and relenting nature giuing place to the stiffenes of others and yeelding to thetempest for a time that societie is compact in it selfe and so cannot but continue because one doth beare the infirmities of another dost thou therefore see thy brother to be ouertaken with some sinne or to be ouer curious very froward too self conceited abounding in his owne sense exceeding hastie ampc beare this his infirmitie now and so he perhaps may beare with thee in the like case another time or beare thou with his curiousnes he will beare with thy dulnes beare with his ficklenes he will beare with thy frowardnes beare with his hastines he will beare with thy selfe conceitdenes for it is to be obserued that the apostle saith not that those onely which are strong should beare the frailties of the weake but that both strong and weake should beare one anothers burdens it beeing a mutuall and reciprocall dutie imposed vpon all because there is none so strong but one time or other he may slippe and fall and so may stand in neede to be supported euen of the weake the palsie man beeing sicke had his burden to wit his bed borne but beeing restored could helpe to beare another mans burden so if thou beare another mans burden that is weake when he is strong he will be readie to beare thine if neede require god commands that if we find our neighbours beast lying vnder his burden we must lift him vp how much more ought we to helpe our brother lying vnder the burden of sinne therefore the strong are to support the weake and the weake must vpon occasion support the strong as in the arch of a building one stone doth beare mutually though not equally the burden of the rest or as harts swimming ouer a great water doe ease one another in laying their heads one vpon the backe of another the foremost that hath none to support him changing his place and resting his head vp on the hindermost thus in a familie the husband must beare with the nicenes and frowardnes of his wife the wife with the fastnes or hastines of her husband those magistrates and ministers which are too cold and backward in good things must beare with the ouer great heat and forwardnes of their fellowmagistrates or fellow ministers and those must beare with them againe seeing both aime at the same ende the edification of the church and the good of the commonwealth thus in god prouidence luther and melancthon were happily ioyned together and did beare with one another luther with his softnes melancthon with his hastines he with his boldnes he with his timorousnes melancthon did well temper the heat and zeale of luther with his mildnes beeing as oyle to his vineger and luther on the other side did warme his coldnes beeing as a fire to his frosennes thus the apostle commandeth that we should beare with the infirmities of those that are weake and not sufficiently catechized in the doctrine of our spirituall libertie purchased vnto vs by christ and not to please our selues too much but rather to please our neighbour in that which is good to edification rom v for amongst other properties of loue reckned vp by s paul corinthian this is not the least that it suffereth all things v that is all such things as may be borne and suffered with good conscience for the good of our brother for looke as a louer doth suffer all things in regard of his loue in three respects first in vndergoing any labour that may be for her good as hercules did for the loue of omphale secondly in bearing patiently all hard measure that is offered him for her sake as iacob did for the loue of rachel thirdly in induring any thing that is imposed vpon him and putting vp what wrong soeuer is done vnto him by her as sampson did for the loue of dalilah so christian charitie causeth vs to suffer all things first pro fratribus to indure any labour cost or trauell for their good secondly propter fratres to beare all afflictions for their sakes as paul saith he did for the church tim thirdly fratribus to beare wrongs and put vp iniuries at their hands as he did beeing shamefully entreated at philippi stoned scourged ampc this must be considered of vs all but specially of such as wil giue a man as good as he bringeth who are but a word and a blow a lie and a stab a word amp a writ such as cannot beare coales as they say nor brook any little wrog nor endure any small frailtie in their brother these man must remeber that in bearing coales that is in suffering and forbearing they heape vp coales of fire vpon their heads as paul speaketh rom as also that god doth beare with them in greater matters euen when they wound him with their oathes leuit and giue him the lie thorough vnbeleefe ioh as he bare the manners of the israelites in the wildernes that christ whose example we are to follow hath borne our infirmities isaiah and doth ease them that trauell and are heauie laden matth and therefore we treading in his steppes must forbeare one another and forgiue one another if any man haue a quarrell against another euen as christ forgaue vs coloss thus if when we see any sinne in our brother we reclaime him from it by reproofes exhortations admonitions we are god instruments to saue a soule from death and so doe couer a multitude of sinnes euen before god iam and if when we perceiue common frailties in our brother we shal not stand too much vpo our right but shall yeeld vnto them in bearing forbearing and forgiuing we shall couer a multitude of sinnes before man pet thus much touching the rule now i proceede to the reason whereby the apostle vrgeth the practise of this precept in these words and so fulfill the law of christ the reason standeth thus that which is the fulfilling of the law of christ must be practised of vs but the bearing of one anothers burdens is the fulfilling of the law of christ therefore we ought to beare one anothers burdens for the clearing of this text sundrie things are to be considered i it may be demanded what the apostle vnderstandeth by the law of christ ans nothing els but the doctrine precept or commaedement of christ enioyning the loue of our brother ioh a new commandement giue i vnto you that ye loue one another as i haue loued you ampc and it is all one as if he had saide beare ye one anothers burdens and so fulfill the commandement of christ who hath after a speciall manner commanded the loue of your brother now the apostle rather vseth the word law then commandement because he would make a clearer antithesis between the law of christ and the law of moses so vehemently vrged by the false apostles as if he should haue said you galatians are taught to obserue the law of moses circumcision daies and times moneths and yeares and so ye doe indeede well if ye will needes be obseruing of lawes here is a law for you to obserue beare with the frailties one of another and so you shal fulfill the most excellent law that euer was the law of christ which is necessarie to be kept whereas the keeping of the ceremoniall law is but in vaine ii quest why doth paul call the loue of our brother the law of christ rather then the law of nature or the law of god or the law of moses seeing it was written in the minde of man in the creation was giuen by god himselfe in mount sinai was written by moses the reliques whereof are yet remaining in the minde of man ans it is so called because it is a new commandement giuen by christ himselfe after a speciall manner but it is hereupon further demanded why this commandement of louing our brother should be called a new commandement to which some make answer that it is so called onely because it shewes a new manner of louing our brother after the example of christ as he hath loued vs now this manner of louing our brother as chrysostom expounds it is this that as christ loued vs freely not mooued by any amiable thing in vs nor for any profit that should redound vnto himselfe thereby so we should freely loue one another not for any benefit receiued or expected but as cyril of alexand vpon john expounds it it stands in this that as christ loued vs more then himselfe so we should loue our brother more then our selues but this cannot be the meaning for s john in his epistle and epistle repeating this new commandement saith onely this is a new commandement that ye loue one another and neuer addes as christ loued vs the which he should haue done if these wordes as i haue loued you be an essentiall part of the new commandement which he enioyneth vs to obserue besides our sauiour himselfe saith a little after by this shall all man knowe that ye are my disciples if ye loue one another not adding as i haue loued you therefore the new commandement is laid downe in these words loue one another not respecting those that follow as a modification or limitation as i haue loued you besides this exposition takes it for granted that the morall lawe loue thy neighbour as thy selfe is a certaine rule by which we are to square our loue vz that we must begin at our selues amp look how much we loue our selues so much we ought to loue our neighbor amp no more amp that therfore christ shold giue a newe commandement of greater perfection then that in the lawe to wit that we loue one another as he loued vs that is more then our selues but this is a flat mistaking of the scripture for the commandement loue thy neighbour as thy selfe is no exact rule whereby we are to trie and examine our loue as the popish doctors and some others teach for then paul and diverse of the saints of god should haue done workes of supererogation more then the lawe requires in louing their neighbours more then themselues rom and if it were a rule it were but a leaden and false rule for we are in some cases bound to loue our neighbour more then our selues especially if he be a greater instrument of god glorie in procuring the good of the church or common wealth as to loue our godly king more then our selues and preferre his safetie and life before our own as the israelites did dauids thou article worth ten thousand of vs sam for s is a note of similitude and not of equalitie signifying that as we loue our selues heartily and earnestly and inwardly wishing all good to our selues with the like sinceretie of affection we should loue our brother so that christ hath added nothing to the lawe in commanding to loue one another as he loued vs others say it is called a newe commandement because it ought to be kept with as great a care and diligence as though it were newe and had beene now first giuen for newe lawes we know are commonly precisely kept at the first but after a while they begin to be neglected and man doe as it were antiquate them accounting them as though they were not others by a new commandement vnderstand another diverse or different commandement for christ in the beginning of the chapter had giuen them a commandement to flie pride to be humble to liue at peace and concord one with anther and then he saith but i giue you a newe commandement i comandement differing fro the former that ye loue one another the word newe is often taken in scripture in this sense as exo there arose vp a new king which knew not ioseph that is as the interpreters and s luke act translate it another king mark they shall speake with new tongues that is other diuer or different languages from their vsuall tongue for the meaning is not that they inuented a new language which was neuer spoken before but that they spake in a language diverse from that which they vsed before for so it is said act they beganne to speake with other tongues thus our sauiour christ telleth his apostles that he will not drinke any more of the fruite of the vine till he drinke it n we with them in the kingdome of god matth where by newe wine he meaneth not the liquour or iuyce of the grape to preserue animall life but another different drinke wherewith he would entertaine all that were inuited and came vnto his table but these expositions are not so fitte i take it therefore to be called a newe commaundement either in respect of christ or of vs in respect of christ two waies because he renued it not onely by freeing it from the false glosses and interpretations of the scribes and pharises the iewish rabbins but also in fulfilling it most perfectly whereas it was obliterated and almost antiquated by the great corruption of man for none did euer so perfectly obserue and keepe the lawe as he did therefore in regard of the newe manner of fulfilling it it is called a newe commaundement because he abrogating the ceremoniall lawe and many iudicials onely renued this precept of the morall lawe in commanding it as his lawe to the church ioh this is my commandement that ye loue one another as if he should say though i haue abrogated the ceremoniall lawe and antiquated the iudiciall yet this commandement shal neuer be abrogated and this i commend vnto you againe and againe as my commmandement which aboue all others i would haue you carefully to obserue as that whereby ye shall be knowne to be my disciples in regard of vs it is called a newe commaundement and that in two respects because it beeing defaced and almost cleane blotted out of the minde of man by originall sinne is renued againe in the hearts of beleeuers by the powerfull operation of the spirit of god both in their minds and affections in their mindes because they are daiely inlightened with the true knowledge thereof in beeing taught whome they ought to loue viz not only their friends but euen their enemy with what kind of loue to wit with a eruent loue not in word or tongue onely but in deed and trueth and that with free sincere and constant loue in their wills and affections in that they are perswaded by the inward working of the spirit to loue and are inclined thereto being renued by grace because it doth after a peculiar manner belong vnto vs who are vnder the new testament in the kingdome of grace seeing that this commandement onely is renued by christ as his owne proper commandement many others being abrogated as also because it is daily written by the spirit of christ after a newe manner in the hearts of newe conuerts so that they haue not onely a newe that is a true knowledge thereof but also a newe that is a true sense and feeling of the power of it in their hearts in that they are become newe creatures in christ iesus for in him all olde things passe away amp all things become new corinthian for to them the lawe is no killing letter written in tables of stone but a quickening spirit as beeing written in the fleshly tables of their hearts this seemeth to be the true full and proper meaning of these places for th s s john epistle doeth expound it when he saith that it is true in him and in you in the sense before specified both in regard of christ and the beleeuers in christ iii quest seeing the commaundement of louing our brother is called the law of christ and a new commandement is not the gospel a new law ans in no wise for albeit the law and the gospel agree in sundrie things as first in the author god beeing the author of them both of the gospel rom of the law rom secondly in that both of them were preached knowne and vnderstood in both testaments the lawe beeing written in the heart of man in the creation the gospel preached to our first parents in paradise immediately after the fall and repeated againe and againe to the patriarkes and prophets from time to time thirdly in the gerall matter and end of them both in that both the law and the gospel require righteousnesse in him that would come to se eternall fourthly in this that they confirme and establish one another in that the lawe commanding iustice and iustifying none shewes that a man is iustified by the free gift and grace of god and that christ is the end of the law to euery one that beleeueth in that the gospel iustifieth not by workes but by faith and yet so as that we doe not by our faith abrogate the lawe or make it of none effect but rather establish it and that in two respects because by faith we apprehend the righteousnesse of christ and so in him who hath fulfilled the lawe for vs we fulfill it and so establish it because hauing our hearts purified by faith we liue no more according to the flesh but according to the spirit and so by inchoa e obedience we fulfill the law lastly in the end in that both the lawe and the gospel tend directly to the manifestation of the glorie of god yet they differ in things first in the manner of reuealing the lawe before the fall was perfectly known by nature and since the falli part rom the gospel is not known by nature neither was it euer written in mans heart before or after the fall as paul saith corinthian those things which the eie hath not seene nor the eare heard nor the heart of man conceiued are they which god hath prepared for them that loue him therefore the gospel is called a mysterie rom v first because the doctrine of the gospel was made knowne to man and angels by the reuelation of god ephesians amp secondly because there is required a special reuelation amp worke of god spirit before a man can yeeld assent vnto it therefore paul saith we haue not receiued the spirit of the world but the spirit of god that we might know the things that are giuen to vs of god corinthian secondly in the subiect or doctrine it selfe and that in two respects first the law preacheth nothing but absolute iustice to the transgressours thereof the gospel sheweth how iustice is qualified with mercie from all things from which ye could not be absolued by the law of moses by him euery one that beleeueth is iustified act secondly the law teacheth what manner of man we ought to be and what we ought to doe that we may come to eternall life but shewes not howe we may becom such indeed the gospel teacheth that by faith in christ we may be such as the law requires god hath made him to be sinn for vs who knewe no sinne that we might be made the righteousnes of god in him corinthian thirdly in the obiect the law is giuen to the vni st amp lawles vngodly amp prophane tim that it may shew them their sinnes and the punishment thereby deserued and so may accuse and condemne them the gospel is to be published and dispensed onely to the penitent which are contrite and broken in heart amp mourne for their sinnes math esay luke iiii the law promiseth eternall life vpon condition of works doe this and liue if thou wi enter into life keepe the commandements the gospel promiseth eternall life freely without any condition of works rom to him that worketh not but beleeueth in him that iustifieth the vngodly his faith is counted to him for righteousnes rom the righteousnes of god is made manifest without the law by the faith of iesus christ vnto all and vpon all that beleeue v in the effects the law is no instrumentall cause of faith repentance or any sauing grace it is the minister of death corinthian causing wrath rom but the gospel causeth life it is the grace of god which bringeth saluation tit for this cause paul calleth the law a dead or killing letter the gospel a quickning spirit corinthian fourthly it may be demaded whether any ma be able to fulfil the law considering that paul biddeth vs beare one anothers burdens and so fulfill the law of christ ans no meere man can perfectly fulfill the law in this life this conclusion s paul prooueth in sundrie of his epistles specially by these arguments first by the great and generall deprauation of nature which remaineth in part euen in the regenerate stayning their best actions and making them like a menstruous cloath confessing withall that his best workes are not answerable to the law by reason of the remainders of originall corruption rom now perfect fulfilling of the law cannot stand with corruption of nature and transgression in life for a corrupt fountaine cannot send forth sweete water neither can a corrupt tree beare good fruit saint iames saith he that offendeth in one is guiltie of all and the scripture pronounceth him accursed that abideth not in all things written in the book of the law to doe them popish doctours answer first that originall corruption which they call the fewell of sinne and the first motions to euill preuenting all consent of will are indeede in the regenerate but they are no sinnes properly but it is false which they teach for euery transgression of the law is a sinne as s john defines it ioh but these are transgressions of the tenth commandement for it either forbiddeth these first motions whether they be prim primae or secund primae as schoolemen speake or it forbid doth nothing but the motios which are with cosent of wil which were forbidden in the former commandements and so in effect there are but nine commandements the tenth forbidding no speciall sinne againe paul teacheth that these motions preuenting all consent of will are formally opposed to the law i see another law in my members rebelling against the law of my minde secondly they answer that paul rom speakes not of himselfe but in the person of the vnregenerate according to the opinion of s augustine ans augustine indeede was once of that iudgement but he after retracted that opinion as it is manifest out of his booke of retractations and the booke against iulian the pelagian and that for these reasons first because paul saith to will is present with me and i doe not the good i would and j delight in the law of god concerning the inward man all which are proper to the regenerate and cannot be affirmed of the wicked secondly because he makes mention of the inward man which is all one with the new man or the new creature which agreeth onely to the regenerate thirdly because he saith he is ledde captiue to sinne v whereas the wicked are not drawne to sinne by force against their wills but runne riot of their owne accord into all wickednes as the horse rusheth into the battell ierem lastly in that he cries out in a sense and sorrow for his sinnes o wretched man that i am who shall deliuer me from the bodie of this death v which can not be the voice of the vnregenerate for they feele not the burden of their sinne nor desire to be eased of it but take delight and pleasure in it his second reason is this such as our knowledge is such is our loue of god and man but our knowledge is onely in part therefore our loue is but in part and so consequently our obedience is but in part amp therfore there is no perfect fulfilling of the law the aduocates of the roman church answer that our knowledge loue and obedience are perfect for the condition and estate of this life as we are viatores which is sufficient though they be not perfect for the condition of the life to come when we shall be comprehensores which is not required at our hands in this life for they make a double perfect fulfilling of the law one for the tearme of this life which is to loue god aboue all things and our neighbour as our selues the other after this life and that is to loue god with all the soule with all the powers and faculties of the soule and with all the strength and vigor of all these powers and this distinction they make to be the ground of their opinion touching the fulfilling of the law and iustification by workes ampc but it is a sandie foundation and therefore that which is built vpon it cannot stand for besides that it is a fond and friuolous distinction forged by the schoolemen without warrant of scripture or consent of antiquitie it is manifestly false for there is one onely rule of righteousnes and not two one onely generall sentence of the lawe more vnchangeable then the lawes of the medes amp persians euen as vnchangeable as god himselfe which is that he which continueth not in all things written in the law to doe them is accursed so that he which loueth not god with all his soule minde and might with all his vald suo that is with all the faculties of his soule and all the powers of all these faculties and that in this life is accursed and it is absurd which they teach that a man is not bound for the tearme of this life thus to loue god but onely in the life to come for looke what man could doe by creation in the state of innocencie the same and so much the law requires at his hands in the state of apostasie but adam by creation could loue god with all his soule with all the faculties of his soule and all the powers of all these faculties therefore the same perfect absolute and entire obedience is now required at his hands for the sentence of the law cursed is he that continueth not in all things ampc is not onely giuen to man glorified but to those that are in the state of grace and s paul doth so apply this sentence to man euen in this life t he pronounceth all that are of the workes of the law to be vnder the curse againe if this were so the iewes had no cause to feare the seueritie and strictnes of the law as they did when they said if we heare the voice of the lord any more we shall die considering they were able to keepe and fulfill it according to this popish opinion neither would god haue promised them a messias or mediatour to redeeme them from the curse of the law but would rather haue comforted them in that their so great feare and astonishment by giuing them to vnderstand that they were not bound to the full and perfect fulfilling of the law for the time of this life besides the patheticall exclamation of paul o miserable man that i am ampc rom and that saying of peter in calling the law a yoke which neither we nor our fathers were able to beare act should be childish and ridiculous if that which is impossible in the law as paul speakes did not appertaine vnto vs the third argument if a man could fulfill the law he should not stand in neede of a mediatour for if righteousnes be by the law christ died in vaine gal it is answered that christ died in vaine if man by the strength of nature could fulfill the law but the fulfilling of the law is by grace and so his death is not in vaine for by vertue of the obedience of christ we are enabled to fulfill the law but this were to make christ no sauiour but onely an instrument whereby we fulfill the law and are our owne sauiours whereas the scripture saith that he is made vnto vs righteousnes corinthian not that we are made righteousnesse by him that we are made the righteousnesse of god in him corinthian not by him as an instrument that we are complete in him coloss and not complete of our selues by him lastly the scripture shutteth vp all man vnder sinne euen the most sanctified prou ioh iob confesseth he cannot answer one of a thousand iob and dauid saith if thou lord shalt marke what is done amisse who can abide it psalm and paul saith of himselfe that he found no meanes to performe that which is good rom he saith further that it is impossible to be kept by reason of originall corruption rom it is answered that all these places and examples must be vnderstood of veniall sinnes which make man sinners indeede yet are not against but beside the law and therefore though a man commit them yet he may fulfill the law for all that ans the comon receiued opinion in schooles that some sinnes are mortall others veniall of their owne nature is a witlesse distinction for if all sinnes deserue death as paul teacheth rom either veniall sinnes are no sinnes or they must needes deserue death moses saith that he that abideth not in all things written in this law is accursed deuter where the wordes this law may not be restrained onely to the catalogue of great and hainous sinnes which are there reckened vp but extended to all sinnes as paul applies it gal pronouncing him accursed that continueth not in all things written in the lawe not this law so that euery sinne euen the least sinne in thought makes a man subiect to the curse and so in rigour of diuine iustice deserues eternall death and it is but a poore shift to say that some sinnes are against the lawe as all mortall sinnes and others besides the lawe as veniall for the doing of that which god forbiddeth is a sinne not beside but against the lawe but idle words iesting and gibing ampc which the popish doctours account veniall sinnes are expressely forbidden in the word matth of euery idle word that man shall speake they shall giue account at the day of iudgement and paul forbiddeth all foolish talking and esting as things vncomely ephesians therefore they are not beside but flatte against the lawe secondly they answer that these places and the like are to be vnderstood of seuerall workes and actions of the saints whereof some were good as dauids sparing of saul ampc some euill as his adulterie murther and numbering of the people and not of the same particular workes answer it is false for paul speaking of the same indiuiduall worke saith that it is partly good and partly euill i finde when i would doe good that euill is present with me rom in my minde i serue the lawe of god in my bodie the lawe of sinne v and the prophet saith that all our righteousnesse is as a menstruous cloath isay therefore euery good worke is stained with sinne thus much shall suffice to shewe that it is impossible for any man in the time of this life to fulfill the lawe the reasons alleadged to the contrary are sufficiently answered before pag ampc to which place i referre the reader it may further be said if we cannot perfectly fulfill the law why doth paul command vs to beare one anothers burdens and so to fulfill the law of christ answer the lawe is said to be fulfilled three waies first by personall obedience and thus christ onely fulfilled it secondly by imputed obedience thus the regenerate fulfill it in christ he beeing their righteousnes corinthian and they complete in him coloss thirdly by inchoate obedience thus zachary amp elizabeth are said to haue walked in all the commandements of the lord without reproofe luke and thus all the faithfull fulfill the lawe in labouring to obey god in all his commandements according to the measure of grace receiued and thus we are said to fulfill the lawe in this place god accepting the will for the deed we are further to consider that fulfilling of the lawe is sometime opposed to the transgression of the law as iam in which sense no man euer did or can fulfill it except christ god and man who for this cause is said to be the end of the lawe for righteousnesse to euery one that beleeueth rom sometime it is opposed to hypocrisie and dissimulation as ioh and thus all the saints fulfill it in that they indeauour to mortifie their corruptions and in all things to approoue their hearts and liues to god in keeping faith amp a good conscience in which sense paul here biddeth vs to fulfill the lawe of christ in performing duties of loue and bearing one anothers burdens it will be said if the lawe can no otherwise be fulfilled then by inchoate obedience to what ende serueth it answer it hath a threefold vse euen since the fall first it serues to restraine the outward man by keeping man in order through feare of punishment of which vse paul speeketh when he saith that the lawe is not giuen to a righteous man but to the lawlesse and disobedient ampc tim secondly to arrouse the drousie conscience and this it doeth many waies by reuealing sinne for by the lawe commeth the knowledge of sinne rom by reuealing the wrath and anger of god for sinne for the lawe causeth wrath rom by conuicting the conscience of sinne when the commandement came sinne reuiued rom by arraigning and condemning vs for sin for the lawe is the minister of death corinthian and so putting vs out of all heart in our selues it causeth vs to flie to the throne of grace and so is our schoolemaster to bring vs to christ gal thirdly it serues as a rule of good life dauid saith that the word of god specially the law is a lanterne to his feete and a light to his paths psalm so that though a regenerate man be not vnder the lawe in regard of iustification or accusation or coaction or condemnation yet he is vnder it in regard of direction and instruction for it shewes what is good what is euill what we ought to doe amp what to leaue vndone lastly whereas paul saith beare ye one anothers burdens and so fulfill the lawe of christ the word s o hath great emphasis for it implies the manner how the galatians and all man are to fulfill the lawe not by obseruing circumcision daies or times moneths or yeares as the false apostles taught but by bearing forbearing and tollerating the infirmities of their brother it may not vnfitly be applyed to the religious orders of franciscans dominicans carthusians ampc let them not thinke that they keepe the lawe by abstaining from flesh by whipping themselues by single life counterfeit fasts voluntary pouertie regular obedience ampc but let them comfort the afflicted releiue the distressed beare with the weake support one another in loue and s o they shall fulfill the law of christ v for if any man seeme to himselfe that he is somewhat when he is nothing he deceiueth himselfe in his imagination in this verse the apostle remooues an impediment which hindereth most from performing the former dutie of bearing other mens burdens and that is a vaine conceit and imagination they haue of their owne excellencie farre aboue their brother in thinking themselues too good to doe any dutie or service vnto them to be their packehorses to beare their burdens this vaine imagination and swelling conceipt which puffeth vp the most the apostle laboureth to purge in this place when he saith he that seemeth to himselfe ampc where by the way we may obserue the method of the apostle first to giue rules of direction after to remooue impediments which may hinder our obedience we see here the force of the word which searcheth the secrets of the heart ebr in that it casteth downe the imaginations and euery high thing that is exalted against the knowledge of god and bringeth into captiuitie euery thought to the obedience of christ corinthian in the words we may obserue these foure things that man are nothing of themselues that thought they be nothing yet they seeme to themselues to be somewhat and that of themselues that in so doing they deceiue themselues the remedies against the ouerweening of our selues for the first it may be demanded howe it can be truely said that man are of themselues meere nothing is he nothing that is created after the image of god in holinesse and righteousnes are princes and potentates nothing that are called god in scripture are they nothing that prophecie and worke miracles answer paul speaketh not of the gifts of god bestowed vpon man but of the man themselues and of them not as they were in the state of innocencie before the fall but as they are nowe in the state of corruption amp apostasie or in the state of grace as they are considered of in and by themselues thus euen spirituall man are nothing of themselues for of them especially the apostle speaketh as it may appeare out of the first verse for first all are by nature the children of wrath and firebrands of hell the gifts of god bestowed vpon vs whether of nature or of grace are not ours but god the giuer of them therefore no man may arrogate more vnto himselfe then another in regard of them seeing all of vs are but stewards and the things we haue are but talents left vs to imploy to our masters aduantage if thou hast receiued them saith paul why boastest thou thy selfe as though thou hadst not receiued them be it that a man be in christ and sanctified yet he hath no greater right to the merits of christ nor greater part in them then he which is lesse sanctified for though sanctification hath degrees and a certaine latitude yet iustification hath none so that a ma is in trueth nothing of himselfe because he hath his beeing and beginning of nothing and tendeth of his owne nature to corruption and nothing in that he is not that which he imagineth himselfe to be though he haue some gifts and graces of god yet is he nothing because he is farre short of that which he ought to be corinthian vpon these considerations abraham acknowledgeth himselfe to be but dust and ashes gen dauid comparing himselfe with the magnificence of saul saith what am i or what is my fathers house sam nay whether we consider man absolutely in himselfe or relatiuely in respect of other creatures as those glorious body the sun moone starres we may say with the prophet dauid lord what is man that thou article mindefull of him or the son of man that thou regardest him psalm paul confesseth himselfe to be nothing in of or by himselfe but by the grace of god saith he i am that i am corinthian and againe i was nothing inferiour to the very chiefe apostles although i am nothing corinthian the apostle affirmeth of euery man which thinketh he knoweth some thing that he knoweth nothing as he ought to know corinthian and of many that they are puffed vp and know nothing tim for a swelling conceit and emptines vsually goe together the second generall thing to be obserued in the words is this that it is naturall for man to thinke too well of themselues to magnifie themselues aboue others in their conceits and in a manner to deifie themselues and to nullifie others in comparison of themselues and this ouerweening of a mans selfe is a branch of pride for a man looking vpon himselfe through the spectacles of selfe loue doth thinke euery small gift of god which he seeth to be in himselfe to be farre greater then in truth it is imagining meere shadowes to be substances or molehills to be as bigge as mountaines for as a man that is in loue doth thinke the blemishes and deformities in his loue to be ornaments which make her more beautifull so those which with narcissus are in loue with themselues and do e vpon their own gifts iudge the vices which they see to be in themselues to be vertues simon magus though a wicked wretch a limme of the deuill a sorcerer ampc yet had this conceit of himselfe and gaue it out also that he was some great man act to wit the great power of god v the church of laodicea thought shee was rich and increased with goods and had neede of nothing whereas shee was wretched and miserable and poore and blind and naked apocrypha and so the skarlet strupet thought her selfe a queene and that shee was out of all daunger of downefall when shee was alreadie fallen apocrypha yes this corruption is so naturall that euen the regenerate themselues who are in part sanctified are tainted therewith and generally they that haue receiued greater gifts of knowledge of sanctification ampc are most ready to ouerweene their owne gifts except god giue them grace to resist this temptation for knowledge puffeth vp corinthian the apostles themselues contended which of them should seeme to be the greatest luke yes in all ages there haue beene some in the church ouerweening themselues as in christs time the iustitiarie pharisies after them the catharists or puritanes who both proudly and odiously called themselues by that name thinking themselues without sinne the donatists that they were a church without spot or wrinkle the iovinianists that a man cannot sinne after the lauer of regeneration the pelagians that the life of a iust man in this world hath no sinne in it at all and of later times the semi pelagian heretike who will be something of himselfe and will haue some stroke in his first conuersion amp wil concur with christ in the worke of iustificatio it will be said papists ascribe all the praise to god ans so did the pharisie luke and yet a wicked iusticiarie for all that now all this ariseth from sundrie causes the first is the bitter roote of pride that was in our first parents when as they affected a higher place in desiring through discontment of their owne estate to deifie themselues and become equall to the highest maiestie in knowing good and euill the second is the ouermuch considering the good things we haue as when the pharisie considered that he gaue tithe of all that he possessed that he fasted twise a weeke that he was not thus and thus as other man luke the third is the comparing of our selues with the infirmities that we see to be in others the pharisie was puffed vp by comparing himselfe with extortioners vniust man adulterers and with the publican the fourth is the false flattering and applause of man which sooth vs vp in our humour in perswading vs to be that which in truth we are not as the people flattered herod when they gaue a shout and said the voice of god and not of man act the third point is that they which thus ouerweene their gifts in thinking themselues somewhat when they are nothing doe notably deceiue themselues as those that thinke they haue the substance when they haue but the shadow as those that dream they are kings or princes being in truth but base persos or to vse the prophets similitude isaiah like as an hungrie man dreameth amp behold he eateth amp when he awaketh his soule is emptie or like as a thirstie man dreameth and loe he is drink and when he awaketh behold he is faint and his soule longeth man are deceiued two waies either by others or by themselues by others as by flatterers they are deceiued occasionally by themselues causally or properly for he that doth iudge himselfe to be that which indeede he is not he may happely please himselfe but he doeth but please himselfe in an errour for in trueth he deceiueth himselfe in his imagination the apostle iames saith if any man seeme specially to himselfe to be religious and yet refraineth not his tongue he deceiueth his owne heart his religion is vaine iam so likewise they that are only hearers of the word amp therfore thinke that all is wel enough with the though they be not doers therof deceiue their owne selues iam and verely this corruption is so great that as man can be content to be deluded by flatterers and clawebackes which please them in their itching humour so they willingly suffer theselues to be deceiued eue by themselues to the ende that they may appeare to others to be that which in trueth they are not that so they may aduauce and magnifie themselues in the accounpt of the world for as alexander the great beeing in india caused his souldiers to make and leaue behind them bittes and horse shoes of an extraordinarie greatnesse hudge speares massie shields big helmets long swords and other furniture for horse and man fitting rather hippocentaurs or giants then man of ordinarie stature and all to the ende it might be said in future time that alexander was a mightie monarch indeed so many there be who setting the faire side outward make goodly glorious shewes in the eies of man and so would haue other to thinke of them accordingly farre aboue their desert that posteritie might iudge them to be that which indeed they are not and so with alexander in deceiuing others they wittingly deceiue themselues which spirituall guile of deceiuing our selues in matters touching our saluation is most dangerous when man delude themselues in perswading themselues falsely that they know sufficient that god is to be loued aboue all our neighbour as our selues which is as much as all the preachers in the earth can say that they beleeue when in stead of faith there is nothing but damnable pride and presumption that they repent when it is nothing but deceitfull counterfeiting and hypocrisie besides the danger consider the indignitie of it man can abide nothing lesse then to be deceiued and circumvented by others and yet behold they are deluders and deceiuers of themselues and that which doth more aggrauate the indignitie of it in such things as ought to be best knowne and most familiar vnto them wherein it is a shame they should be deceiued vz in the knowledge of themselues and that which is yet more in a matter of greatest moment in the saluation of their soules what maruaile therefore is it that man should be deceiued by the seducer of all seducers the deuill who are so easily deceiued of themselues or rather willing to deceiue themselues further obserue that proud conceited persons such as haue an ouerweening of themselues and their gifts and of all man thinke fowle scorne to be deceiued euen they are easiliest deceiued yes and that of themselues for so the apostle saith he that thinketh that he is somewhat ampc deceiueth himselfe in his imagination againe marke hence that no man be their gifts neuer so rare their callings neuer so high their places neuer so great are to good to beare other mens burdens for they that thinke themselues to be somewhat some great man that is too good to put vnder their shoulders to beare the frailties and infirmities of their brother doe nothing herein but deceiue themselues princes and potentates of the earth are prophecied by esay chap verse to be nourcing fathers and nourcing mothers vnto the church not onely by nourishing and defending it as the nource her child but also by bearing with the frailties and wants which are therein lastly consider that this selfe conceitednesse and ouerweening of a mans selfe is the very bane and poyson of loue for it maketh proude man thinke themselues too good to become packe horse or drudges to beare other mens burdens to become seruiceable vnto them in any dutie of loue or to tollerate their frailties or to yeelde of their right or to suffer iniuries at their hands or to put vp any little indignitie without stomacke and discontent because they imagine themselues euery way better then their brother and therefore ought to be tollerated but not so bound to tollerate and beare with others so that where selfe loue is there is no true brotherly loue it was well said of the poet non ben conveniunt ampc maiestas amp amor it may may be said may not he that is priuie to his owne vertues in conscience of his owne worth iudge himselfe to be somewhat that is to be that which indeed he is or to haue a greater measure of knowledge grace and other gifts then they that haue lesse answer he may for humilitie is not sottish the master in humilitie cannot thinke his scholler more learned then himselfe except he shall thinke against his conscience for that saying let euery man thinke better of another then of himselfe must be restrained onely to equalls and not extended to superiours in regard of their inferiours secondly i answer that the apostle in that place speaketh not of the giftes and graces bestowed vpon man but of the persons themselues and of them not so much as they are in the account of man as in the account of god for he saith not let euery man thinke another more learned wise discreete sober then himselfe for so he may thinke against his conscience but let euery man thinke another that is any other that is his brother in the lord better then himselfe to wit before god and this euery man may doe with good conscience for albeit another shall outwardly seeme more ignorant negligent backward in matters of religion then himself yet for any thing he knoweth he may be higher in the fauour of god then he and therefore though a man erre in thinking of another better then of himselfe yet he shall not doe any thing against his conscience thus the publican accounted the proud pharisie better then himselfe for he held him as iust himselfe not worthie to looke vp to heauen yet herein he sinned not nay he is commended for it though he erred in his iudgement of the pharisie and so if the pharisie had reputed the publican better then himselfe that is higher in god fauour then himselfe he had not sinned nor done against his conscience for though he might iudge himselfe more iust then the publican in regard of his life past yet for his present estate before god he could not though dauid knew in the particular quarrell between saul and him that saul was vniust and he innocent yet if he should haue thought better of saul in generall then of himselfe he should but haue done his dutie the fourth and last point containeth the remedies of this euill which are the rather to be considered because it is a great sinne one of those seuen which the lord doth most of all detest prou a dangerous sinne hauing a heauie woe attending vpon it woe to them that are prudent in their owne eyes isa a sinne almost incurable seest thou a man that is wise in his owne eyes there is more hope of a feele then of him prou therefore the remedies are more carefully to be known and applied the remedies are specially fiue the first is to looke our selues in the glasse of the law which will shew what we are without flatterie or partialitie amp by it we shall see nothing in our selues but the vgly shape of satan cleane defacing the image of god and that in vs there dwelleth no good thing as paul saith of himselfe rom that there is nothing but vanitie in our mindes rebellion in our wills a confused ataxie in all our affections transgression in our liues the viewing of our hearts and liues in the law and the considering of our wretched estate in that we are vnder the fearefull curse which is a thunderbolt annexed to euery breach thereof will driue vs out of all conceit of our selues from our selfe loue and selfe liking nay it will make vs goe out of our selues not onely to denie our selues as christs commands but euen to abhorre our selues repenting in dust and ashes as iob did chap causing vs to become flat nothing in our selues that we may be something in christ as paul saith corinthian let no man deceiue himselfe if any man among you seeme to be wise in this world let him be a foole that he may be wise secondly when we feele our selues to be tickled with the itching humour of selfe loue and selfe liking arising from our hidden corruption either in regard of outward gifts or inward graces we must make our owne euills sinnes blemishes imperfections for there is no man but hath one or other a soueraigne remedie against it and so as it were driue away one poison with another as to call to minde some great deformitie that is in our body some great infirmitie that is in our minde some crosse or miserie in our outwarde estate some vile and abominable sinne which we haue committed and the horrible punishment to the which we are lyable by reason thereof and no doubt but the serious consideration of these or any of these wil be auaileable to nippe pride in the bud amp kill the serpent in the shell and in so doing we shall with the peacocke now and then cast our eyes downeward to our feete the fowlest and vgliest things we haue and not alway stand in admiration of our gay feathers amp glorious traine thirdly we must consider that the things for which we looke so high and swell so in our owne conceits are not our owne but lent vs for a time for what is there that thou hast not receiued whether in gifts of bodie or graces of minde nay whether thou speake of soule or bodie it selfe and if thou hast receiued it why boastest thou thy selfe as though thou haddest not receiued it what vanitie is it for a man to be proud of another mans garment or for a woman to boast of her borrowed haire the wicked persecutors of the church are reprooued for sacrificing to their nets and burning incense to their yarne hab further we must consider we haue not onely receiued them but that we haue so receiued them as that they are not our owne with which we may doe what we list but talents lent vs for a time and left with vs to employ ouer which we are but stewards and bayliffes not lord or masters and that we must be countable for the smallest gift euen the least farthing how we haue got it kept it bestowed it the time will come when it shall be saide vnto thee giue an account of thy stewardship luke therefore we ought not so much to be puffed vp with the greatnes of our talents as to be humbled with the consideration of the strict reckning that god will require at our hands seeing that of him to whome much is committed much shall be required fourthly to the end we may auoid this ouerweening of our selues let vs compare our selues with the maiestie of god in whose sight we are but as silly wormes crawling vpon the ground nay in comparison of whome we are lesse then nothing and vanitie it selfe consider that to him ene y knee doeth bowe of things in heauen in earth and vnder the earth and thou wilt not be so conceited of thy selfe that a sillie man doth crouch vnto thee that to him euery tongue doth confesse and sing his praises the blessed angels crying continually holy holy holy lord god of sabboth heauen and earth are full of thy glorie and then a short blast of winde or popular applause shall not so easily puffe thee vp like an emptie bladder or carrie thee away as it did herod act but to omit this odious comparison between a fraile mortall man and the glorious euerliuing god there beeing no comparison between finit and infinit let vs neuer compare our selues with our inferiours but with our superiours and betters who are eminently aboue vs in euery gift and blessing of god in regard of whose honours and preferments we are but base and contemptible in regard of whose knowledge we are but children and know nothing in regard of whose riches we are but beggars and haue nothing for as dauid when he beheld the wonderfull frame of the heauens those glorious creatures the sun the moone and the starres by and by made this vse of it to himselfe to consider his owne vilenes in regard of them what is man that thou are mindfull of him or the son of man that thou visitest him so when we compare our selues with others that are as farre aboue vs as the heauens are aboue the earth whose gifts and graces doe as farre excell ours as the bright sunneshine the dimme candle light we cannot chuse but be abashed and confounded in our selues acknowledging that there is no such cause why we should so magnifie our selues aboue others and nullifie others in comparison of our selues but let euery man prooue his owne worke and then shall he haue reioycing in himselfe onely and not in another here the apostle laieth downe another remedie against selfe loue and ouerweening of our selues and it is the fift and the last of which i purpose to entreat and it stands in proouing and examining of a mans owne worke by it selfe without comparing it with an others mans worke and withall in the approouing of it vnto god let euery man approoue his owne worke and he giues two reasons why euery man ought to approoue his owne workes vnto god amp to consider them absolutely in themselues and not relatiuely in respect of others the first reason is in this verse then shall he haue reioycing in himselfe onely and not in another the second in the next verse for euery man shall beare his owne burden touching the remedie let euery man prooue his owne worke the word translated prooue signifieth also to approoue as rom blessed is he that condemneth not in himselfe in the thing that he approoueth corinthian whosoeuer ye shall approoue or allow of by letters and so the word is vsed in english when we say such a one is to prooue a will that is approoue it the word in this place i take it may be vnderstood in both senses to prooue our workes and to approoue them how we are to prooue our workes by taking triall and examination of them i haue already shewed in the former verse but we are further to approoue them to god according to pauls commandement study to shew thy selfe approoued vnto god tim and his practise in coueting alway to be acceptable vnto him corinthian this approouing of our works is a soueraigne remedie against ouerweening of our selues for he that alwaise stands vpon his tryall and god approbation cannot be puffed vp with self loue of himselfe or selfe liking of his own works but rather humbled with the consideratio of god absolute iustice and his owne imperfections and so stirred vp with greater diligence to worke out his saluation with feare and trembling nowe we shall approoue our workes vnto god if we obserue these three things first that all our actions specially in the worship and seruice of god be grounded vpon the will amp word of god amp not vpon wil worship or humane inuentios otherwise it will be said who required these things at your hands secondly that we performe all our actions sincerely and vprightly as in the presence of god with an honest heart and a good conscience as abimelech protesteth of himselfe gen and hezekiah isay and paul act thirdly that they alway tend to a good end as the glorie of god whether ye eate or drinke or whatsoeuer ye doe doe all to the glorie of god corinthian and the good of our brother let all things be done to edification corinthian it may here be demaunded whether we may not approoue our selues and our actions to man to which i answer that we may amp ought for although we may not be man pleasers that is such as frame and temper our actions and our speeches so as they may alway be pleasing to the corrupt humour and wicked affections of man for then we were not the servant of god gal yet we are to please them in that which is good to edification rom corinthian and christ comandeth that our light should so shine before man that they may see our good works and paul biddeth vs to procure honest things in the sight of all man and whatsoeuer things are true and honest and iust and pure whatsoeuer appertaine to loue and are of good report we must thinke on them and practise them philipp yet we must seeke for the approbation of man with these cautions first we must so seeke for the approbation of man as that we do not seeke it nor rest in it alone but withall seek to be approoued of god for he that praiseth himselfe and so consequently he that is praised of others is not approoued but he whoe the lord praiseth corinthian how can ye beleeue saith our sauiour christ which receiue honour one of another and seeke not the honour that commeth of god alone ioh secondly we must seeke for the approbation of god in the first place and in the second place to be approoued of man as christ did for he grew in fauour first with god and after with man luke and the elders who by faith obtained a good report hebr read rom thirdly we must neuer looke for the approbation of the multitude or acclamation of the most for that cannot be done without ambition and vaine glorie in seeking popular applause woe be to you when all man speake well of you luke thus christ saith he sought not praise of me for those that are addicted to popular applause and are ouer curious of their credit immoderately seeking to get and keepe a good name with all sorts of man while they seeke for fame they loose a good name in seeking fame from the wicked which is but a shadow and loosing a good name in the opinion of the godly which is the substance fourthly we must so farre seeke for the approbation of the wicked that we minister no not the least occasion of offence vnto them corinthian giue no offence neither to the iew nor to the gentile but to conuict their consciences and to stoppe their mouths by our godly amp vnblameable conuersatio which may be a preparatiue for them against the day of their visitation pet haue your conuersation honest among the gentiles that they which speake euill of you as of euill doers may by your good workes which they shall see glorifie god in the day of the visitation fiftly in doing our duties we must not respect the iudgement of the world neither fearing the faces nor the censures of man this was pauls practise corinthian i passe very little to be iudged of you or of mans iudgement we must goe through good report and euill report corinthian lastly we must seeke to be approoued of man not so much in regard of our selues as that by this meanes god glorie may be more and more aduanced for our light must so shine before man that they may see our good workes and glorifie our father which is in heauen matth if we obserue these sixe cautions we may with good conscience seeke to get a good name which will be vnto vs as a pretious oyntment refreshing vs with the comfort of a godly life prou ecclesiastes thus much of the remedie the reason followeth and then shall he haue whereof to reioyce in himselfe and not in another the wordes translated to reioyce signifie to glorie which is more then to reioyce there is a double ground of glorying one out of a mans selfe another in himselfe out of himselfe in god alone let not the wise man glorie in his wisdome nor the strong man in his strength nor the rich man in his riches but let him that glorieth glorie in this that he vnderstandeth and knoweth me ier corinthian in himselfe in the comfortable testimonie of a good conscience our glorying is this the testimonie of our conscience that in simplicitie and godly purenes we haue had our conuersation in the world corinthian the one is glorying before god the other before man the one of iustification the other of holy conuersation for time past and constant resolution for time to come the one in the testimonie of our conscience corinthian the other in the testimonie of god spirit witnessing to our spirits that we are the sonnes of god rom the first is not meant in this place but onely the second for no flesh can glorie in his presence corinthian it will be said this glorying in a mans selfe is vaine glorie and a branch of pride ans it differs from vaine glorie first in the foundation for vaine glorie hath for his ground our owne vertues and gifts considered as comming from our selues and not from god whereas this true glorying is grounded vpon them as they are fruits of regeneration proceeding from our iustification by christ and reconciliation with god secondly in the ende vaine glorie tendeth to the aduancing of our selues in an opinion of our proper iustice and desert this true glorying aimeth at the glorie of god alone obiect paul reprooues those that consider their owne gifts onely neuer comparing themselues with others corinthian they vnderstand not that they measure themselues with themselues and compare themselues with themselues therefore it seemes that a man by comparing himselfe with others may haue whereof to reioyce ans he reprooues the false apostles in that place for glorying in the gifts which they had and the number of proselytes which they had wonne neuer comparing themselues with himselfe or any other apostle which was the cause they were so puffed vp with pride for to compare our selues with those that are eminently aboue vs is a notable meanes to abate pride as i haue alreadie shewed whereas the measuring of our selues by our selues with our inferiours is the onely way to encrease it and this is it which the apostle reprooues in this place further we may reioyce or glorie in the testimonie of a good conscience if we obserue these rules i in our best desires endeauours actions we must labour to feele our owne defects that we doe not the good we should nor in that manner we ought ii we must labour to haue euen our best workes our almes praiers ampc couered with the righteousnes of christ for it is the sweete odour of his sacrifice that doth perfume all our actions that they may be acceptable to god beeing offered with the praiers of the saints vpon the golden altar revelation iii we must acknowledge all the good things we haue the will and the worke the purpose and the power to proceed from god alone philip iam iiii we must reioyce in them not as causes but as fruits of iustification so that if the question be whether we be iustified by them or not we must renounce them tread them vnder our feete and account them as dongue as paul did philip hence we learne sundrie things i that if we would haue a light heart and passe our time merrily with comfort amp content we must looke to approoue our hearts to god in all our actions ii it contutes the opinion of the multitude who iudge those that make conscience of sinne and lead a more strict life then the common sort endeauouring with paul to haue alwaies a cleare conscience toward god and toward man of all others to lead a most melancholike sadde and vncomfortable life for the truth is this is the onely true ioy all other ioy is but counterfeit in comparison it is radicall proceeding from the heart the other but superficiall from the teeth outward it comforts a man in the midst of afflictions whereas a man may haue the other and yet in the midst of mirth his heart will be sorrowfull this is permanent and during the other transitorie and fading it is like the ioy in haruest psalm and which they haue that diuide a spoyle isaiah therefore salomon saith it is a continuall feast prou and peter calls it ioy vnspeakable and glorious pet iii this shewes that there is much false ioy in the world consisting wholly in honours profit pleasures none of which haue their ground in a mans selfe and therefore beeing out of a mans selfe they are not true and durable but false and vanishing ioyes now those which haue no comfort but out of themselues are of foure sorts first such as reioyce and glorie in the opinion that the world hath of them and not in the testimonie of their owne conscience secondly such as reioyce not in their reconciliation with god but in their blamelesse conuersation in that they haue not beene open offenders or man of scandalous life luke thirdly such as reioyce in the vertues of their ancestors as the iewes bragged they were the seede of abraham ioh which vaine glorying of other mens vertues john baptist reprooueth when he saith thinke not to say with your selues we haue abraham for our father ampc mat fourthly such as reioyce amp thinke themselues in a good case because they see others worse then themselues this is right the pharisies ioy o god i thanke thee i am not thus and thus or like this publican luke this is it which the apostle directly aimeth at in this place when man thinke theselues iust because others are more wretched then themselues and pure because others are more defiled whereas other mens hainous sinnes shall not iustifie vs and our less sinnes saue onely as ierusalem iustified her sisters sodome and samaria ezek but so a man may be iustified and yet condened for euery one shall beare his owne burden here paul laies downe a second reason of his assertion in the former verse why euery man ought to prooue his owne worke rather then to be curious in searching into the liues and skanning the actions of other man because euery man shall beare his own burde which is all one with that gal to beare a mans owne iudgement and that rom to giue an account to god for himselfe it is a prouerbiall speech the meaning wherof is expressed by the like ier euery man that eateth the sower grape his teeth shall be set one edge and by that which is common amongst vs euery vessel shall stand vpon it owne bot to e that is euery man shall beare the punishment of his owne sinne for as the indian is not therefore white because the morian is more blacke or as the sand blind is not therefore sharpe sighted because some other is stone blinde so no man is therefore acquit of his sinnes because others are greater sinners or exempt from punishment because others shall vndergoe a deeper conde nation therefore confidering that euery man must beare the guilt and punishment of his owne sin he ought more narrowly to looke to himselfe then to others and to be a more seuere censurer of himselfe then of another for the better vnderstanding of the words sundrie questions are to be discussed first it may be demaunded howe euery man should beare his own burden seeing we are commanded to beare one anothers burdens ans there are two sorts of burdens the first is of giuing an account to god thus euery man shall beare his owne burden for euery man must giue an account for himselfe vnto god rom the second is of bearing one anothers infirmities of which paul speakes verse in this sense a man is not to beare his owne burden but euery man his brothers for the apostle to crosse the opinion of those which thought a man was polluted with other mens sinnes saith euery man shall beare his owne burden and to meete with the carelesnesse of others who respect themselues alone neuer minding the good of their brother he saith beare ye one anothers burdens ii obiect by bearing of our owne burdens is vnderstood giuing an account for our selues vnto god nowe euery man is not to giue account for himself alone but for those also that are comitted to his charge as the father for his child the master for his servant the magistrate for the subiect the sheapheard for the sheepe ezek his blood will i require at thy hand hebr they watch ouer your soules as they that must giue account answer gouernour and superiours are not to giue account for the sinnes of those that are committed vnto them but for the sinnes which themselues commit in not looking vnto them not admonishing them not restraining them not taking condigne punishment of them for their offences this is plainly ta ght ezek if thou doest not admonish the wicked of his way he shall die for his iniquitie but his blood will i require at th hand neuerthelesse if thou warne the wicked of his way to turn from it if he doe not turne from his way he shall die for his iniquity but thou hast deliuered thy soule iii obiect infants which haue not sinned after the manner of the transgression of adam doe beare the burden of adams sinne therefore all doe not beare their own burden ans first the words are properly to be vnderstood of personall or actuall sinnes which are proper to euery man in particular and not of originall sinne or the sinne of our nature which is common to all mankind beeing propagated together with nature secondly i answer that adams sinne was our sinne and therefore seeing infants partake with him in the sinne it is iust with god they should partake with him in the punishment and so beare their owne burden for albeit the transgression of adam was his actuall and personall sinne yet it is our originall sinne or the sinne of our nature seeing it is ours by imputation and propagation of nature together with corruption for as leui was in the loynes of abraham when melchizedech met him and payed tithes in abraham hebr so all mankind was in the loynes of adam when he sinned as the branches are in the roote or in the seede and therefore when he sinned we also sinned as the apostle saith jn whome all sinned rom for so the words are in the originall and not as it is commonly translated for as much as all man haue sinned iv obiect in the second commandement the lord threateneth to visit the sinnes of the fathers vpon the children to the third and fourth generation therefore they beare not their owne burden but part of their parents burden and parents doe not beare their owne whole and entire burden but their children for them ans the clause in the second commandement of visiting the sinnes of the fathers vpon the children doeth not contradict that of ezek the son shall not beare the iniquitie of the father neither shall the father beare the iniquitie of the son the same soule that sinneth that shall die for they are reconciled v if he that is a wicked man begette a son that seeth all his fathers sinnes which he hath done and feareth neither doth the likehe shall not die in the iniquitie of his father but shall surely liue therefore the threatning in the second commandement is not to be vnderstood absolutely as though god would alway plague the children for the fathers sinne but conditionally if they persist and continue in their sinnes walking in their waies and treading in their steps and the same answer is giuen in the second commandement that god will not visit the sinne of the fathers vpon the children saue vpon those that hate him it may be said the sinnes of the parents are not vindicated vpon the children because the punishment inflicted vpon their posteritie is not felt of the parents ans first children are as it were a part of their parents and therefore they beeing punished their parents are punished with them secondly it is a corrasiue and a torment to parents to knowe th their children shall be seuerely punished and afflicted thirdly the punishment of posteritie hath a relation to the parent seeing god hath threatened he will punish the children which walke in the wicked waies of their fore fathers that so he may testifie how extreamly he abhorreth both their sinne and the sinne of their progenitors fourthly the parents sinne is often a cause of the childrens sinne seeing that god in his iust iudgement curseth a wicked mans posterity by leauing them to themselues to blindenesse of minde and hardnesse of heart that so they may fulfill the measure of their fathers as our sauiour christ speaketh matth and by their owne sinnes may iustly pull vpon them condigne punishment lastly god doth more manifest his wrath against the sinne of the parent by punishing the child obiect v numb the chiefest of the israelites were hanged vp before the lord for the fornication and idolstrie of the people therefore they did not beare the burden of their own sinne ans they were punished for their owne sinne for they consented to worship the idol and commit folly with the daughters of moab or r ther were principall ring leaders and first actors in this commick tragedie as may appeare by the practise of zimri prince of the familie of the sime nites v in bringing c sbie a madianitis woman into his tent in the sight of moses and the whole congregation therefore because they did not hinder them from committing this fact as they might beeing in place of gouernment but did partake with them in the sin they are first punished amp that more seuerely for a thousand of them were hanged vp the same day v the rest of the people to the number of thousand were slain by the sword at the commandement of god v to which paul had an eye when he said that there fell in one day thousand corinthian meaning of the common sort excluding those that were hanged vp for in all there were thousand number thus the contrarieti which seemes to be between those two places may be better accorded then to say as some doe that the pen man or scribes failed in copying out the bookes or as others that it was in paul or as others that paul is not contrarie to moses seeing that if there were thousand as moses saith there were thousand for there is no reason why the apostle should vse the lesse number rather then the greater except that which i haue said considering the greater is as round a number as the lesse obiect vi dauid sinned in numbring the people and they were punished for his sinne achan sinned and the people fell slaine before the man of ai therefore euery man doth not beare his owne entire burden the like may be said of the children of the sodomits and of the first borne of the egyptians who bare the burden of their parents sinne ans the people were punished for their owne sinnes and so was dauid albeit not in his owne but in their persons for god punished him in his kind in destroying the people with that fearefull plague in whose great multitude he had gloried so much indeede their punishment was occasioned by his sinne but caused by their owne for no man though neuer so holy is without sinne and therefore none but deserue punishment nay it is god mercie that we are not consumed lam and albeit all the infants perished in the deluge and in the ouerthrow of sodome and gomorrha which could neither imitate nor approoue the actions of their forefathers yet their death was deserued for though infants be truly called innoc ts in regard of actuall sinne yet they are not innocents in regard of originall for from the wombe they carrie a woluish nature which prepares them to the spoile though they neuer did hurt the scorpion hath his sting within him though he doe not alway strike and though a serpent may be handled whilst the cold ath benummed him yet when he is warmed he will hisse out his venomous poison mans practise doth cleare god of vniustice in this behalfe in killing the young cubbes as well as the old foxe the wolues whelps as well as the damme albeit if we speake of their finall estate and come to particulars we are to leaue secret iudgements to god the example of achan is more difficult seeing that for his sinne of the people were slaine iosh and his whole familie rooted out v who were not consenting to his fact nor guiltie of his sinne yet something may probably be said in this case first that they were guiltie of this his sinne in part in not punishing theft so seuerely as they ought to haue done which was a meanes to embolden achan to steale the execrable thing secondly that priuate good must yeeld to the publike as the life of euery particular person to the generall good of the whole commonwealth thus souldiours in the war redeem the publike peace by the losse of their own liues now the manifestation of the glorie of the wisdome power and iustice of god is the publike good of the whole church therefore mens priuate good euen their liues must giue place to it especially considering he neuer inflicts temporall punishment for the publike good but he respects therein the priuate good of his elect whome he corrects in iudgement not in urie thirdly howsoeuer achan did beare the burden of his owne sinne this iudgement might be inflicted vpon them for their good for temporall punishment yes death it selfe is sometimes inflicted for the good of those that are punished as we see in the children of the sodomits many whereof no doubt were taken away in mercie lest malice should haue changed and corrupted their minds and sometime for the terrour of others to be a warning peece to make them take heede and sometime for both as it may be it was in this particular fourthly sinne committed by a particular man that is a member of a politike bodie doth after a sort belong to the whole bodie thus the lord saith that blood defileth the land which canot be clesed of the blood that was shedde therein but by the blood of him that shedde it numb and thus achans sinne though not knowne to the people made the whole armie guiltie before god till he was put to death iosh lastly if the tithing of an armie for the offence of some fewe haue beene thought lawful and iust why should the death of man seeme vniust for the sin of achan especially considering it was to make the people more prouident to preuent and take heede of the like euill if these reasons satisfie not yet let vs rest in this that god iudgements are often secret but alway iust see august lib quaest in iosh q and calvin in cap osh obiect uii if euery man must beare his owne burden dauid shall as well beare the burden of his murthering vrias by the sword of the children of ammon as saul the murthering of himselfe with his owne sword peter his denying christ as iudas his betraying him ampc ans by the sentence of the law euery one is to beare his owne burden and to satisfie for his owne sinne in his owne person but the gospel the second part of god word makes an exception which is that they which haue their sinnes set vpon christs reckening shall not giue account for them againe and those that haue the burden of them laide vpon his shoulders who hath borne our sinnes in his bodie vpon the crosse pet shall not beare the burden of them themselues at the last iudgement therefore true beleeuers which haue christ their suretie satisfying the rigour of god iustice for them shall not answer or satisfie forthe themselues for they are freed by him from a threefold burden first fro the burden of ceremonies amp so consequently of humane lawes and ordinances which were a yoke as peter saith which neither we nor our fathers were able to beare act secondly from the burden of miseries and crosses which befall man in this life he doth ease vs of this burden by his word and spirit either in remoouing them away psalm or in giuing strength and patience to beare them corinthian or in mitigating amp proportionating them to our strength corinthian thirdly from the burden of sinne as well originall as actuall in beeing made sinne that is accounted a sinner and made a sacrifice for sinne for vs as also by easing them that are heauie laden in pacifying the perplexed conscience matth it will be said if christ beare the burden of our sinnes euery man shall not beare his owne burden ans both be true and may well stand together for legally euery man is to beare his owne burden the law requiring personall obedience or satisfaction or both euangelically christ our suretie doth beare the burden of them and satisfie the iustice of god for them pet use hence we learne first that no man can pay a ransome for his brother or redeeme his soule from death or satisfie the iustice of god for his sinne seeing that euery man by the tenour of the law is to beare his owne burden and by the gospel none can be our suretie but christ secondly here we see the nature of sinne that it is a burden to the soule for it is heauier then the grauell of the earth and the sand of the sea it is a burden to the wicked angels for it waighed them fro the highest heauen and made them fall like thunderbolts into the lowest hell to man for as dauid saith it is like a gri ous burden too heauie for him to beare psalm to god for the hypocriticall and ceremoniall seruice of the iewes was such a burden vnto him that he was wearie to beare it isa behold i am pressed vnder you a a cart is pressed that is full of sheaues amos to the creatures who groane vnder this burden beeing by mans sinne subiect to vanitie and corruption rom hence it followeth then that those which feele not the waight amp burden of their sinnes are dead being aliue as paul speaks in another case tim thirdly we are not to wonder that sinne beeing so heauie a burden should be made so light a matter by carnall man for it is a spirituall burden and therefore no maruell though it be not elt of them that are all flesh and no spirit fourthly this shewes that the more a man doth feele the burden of his sinnes the greater measure of grace and spirituall life he hath and the lesse he feeleth it the more he is to suspect himselfe that the graces of god doe wane and decay in him for corruption is not felt by corruption but by grace amp therfore the more a man doth feele the burden of his owne corruption the more grace he hath fiftly by this we see that the greatest part of the world are dead in their sinnes in that they haue no sense nor feeling of this heauie burden there is indeede great crying out of the stone in the reynes because it is felt to be a great orment to the bodie but there is little or no complaining of the stone in the heart because man want spirituall life and sense to discerne it all man can take pittie vpon a beast if he lie vnder his burden and will be readie to helpe him vp againe but all haue not the like sight and sense of the spirituall burden of sinne not sympathy of the miserie of their brother groaning vnder it sixtly whereas paul saith euery man must beare his owne burden he meeteth with the prophanenesse and atheisme of our time when man make a mocke at the day of iudgement amp the strict account that euery man is to giue for himselfe the iewes were woont to east at the threatnings of god denounced by the prophets and to call the visions of the prophets o us iehouae the burden of the lord in a merriment vsing it a a by word ierem thereby signifying that the threats of god were but vaine bugs or scarre crowes which might perhaps terrifie children but could not hart them the like prophanenesse infidelitie atheisme hath crept into the mindes of many who otherwise pro esse the gospel which they testifie by their speeches in saying they are sure sinne is nothing so ougly hell is not halfe so hotte nor the deuill hal e so blacke as preachers say they are or if they be they are sure they shall not goe loaden alone with the burden of their sinns but shall haue copany amp shall perhaps abide the brunt as well as their fellows but alas they know not that the burde of sinne is intollerable that it will eternally presse the down to the gul e of hell amp that they shall neuer be able to be ridde or eased of it seuenthly we are here admonished to take heede of euery sinne for there is no sinne so small but hath his waight and such a waight as will presse downe to the bottomlesse pit ro and though some be greater then others and sinke a ma deeper into condemnation yet many small sinnes will as easily condemne as a few great like as sands though but small in quantitie yet beeing many in number will as soone sinke the ship as if it were laden with the greatest burden eightly seeing the guilt and punishment of sinne is so heauie a burden we are to ease and disburden our selues thereof and that we may doe this we must labour to feele the intollerable waight of it pressing and oppressing the conscience therefore as those who in their sleepe are troubled with the ephialtes or mare feeling as it were a great mountaine lying vpon them and pressing them down would giue all the world the waight might be remooued so we feeling the waight and burden of our sinnes are to labour to be disburdened and eased thereof amp this we shall doe by our repentace toward god and faith in christ math come vnto me all ye that are wearie and laden and i will ease you ver let him that is taught in the word make him that hath taught him partaker of all his goods in these words the apostle laieth downe an other rule touching the maintenance of the ministerie and competencie of allowance for the ministers of the word for it seemeth that the ministrie among the galatians was at that time much neglected at least not so respected as it ought in handling of the rule i will first shewe the meaning of the words secondly the reasons of the rule thirdly the obiections against it lastly the doctrine and vses that are to be gathered from it the meaning let him that is taught the word translated taught signifieth him that is catechized or taught familiarly by word of mouth or liuely voice as when children are taught the first principles of religion but here it hath a larger signification as oecumenius hath well obserued for him that is any way taught and instructed whether it be in the first principles and rudiments or in points of greater difficultie whether plainely and familiarly as catechizers vse to doe or more profoundly for the instruction of the learned taught in the word what needes this addition may some say is there any catechizing without the word answer the apostle addeth in the word to shew that he meaneth not so much the doctrine of christian religion contained in the scriptures as the doctrine of the gospel which by an exoche or peculiar excellencie is called the word act they were forbidden of the holy ghost to preach the word in asia which is expounded v to be the preaching of the gospel thus it is vsed act when they had preached the word in perga mark the sower soweth the word and so in sundrie other places and it is further called the word of the kingdome matth because it teacheth what is the kingdom of grace and glorie and because it beeing beleeued or as the apostle speakes beeing mingled with faith in our hearts doth make vs freedenizens of the kingdome of grace in this life and doth aduance vs to the kingdom of glorie in the life to come secondly it is called the word of god because he is the author of it and no creature man or angel thess thirdly the word of saluation act because it shewes the way and meanes of attaining saluation lastly the word of life act because it doth not only shew the narrow way that leadeth to eternall life but is in it selfe a liuely word and mightie in operation heb for as the powerfull word of god in the beginning did giue beeing to things that were not so the gospel being the power of god to saluation to euery one that beleeueth doth make new creatures by the immortall seede of the word make him that taught him q d catechized him yet as before it must be taken generally for any kind of teaching or instruction for so the word is vsed else where in scripture as luke act rom corinthian so that this text giueth vs no iust occasion to speake of the originall manner vse and profit of catechizing partaker of his goods by goods he oecumen vnderstandeth foode rayment lodging bookes and other necessaries without the which a minister of the word cannot followe his calling for paul calleth these goods according to the common opinion which so iudgeth of them luke soule thou hast much goods laid vp for many yeares luke son remember that thou in thy life time receiuedst thy good things make them partaker that is communicate affoard giue vnto them these temporall things seeing they giue you spirituall of all his goods not in giuing all away but imparting to their teachers what they stand in neede of accounting nothing to deare for them the papists vpon this ground take tithe of all as the priests did in the leuiticall lawe wheras paul speaks nothing of tithes there are foure principall duties which the people are to performe to their pastor three of them are recorded else where in scripture the first is to heare them as embassadours sent of god with reuerence the second is to obey them and submit themselues vnto them in the lord the third to loue and honour them for the worke sake the fourth the apostle speakes of in this place to giue them not onely countenance but also maintenance the reasons of this rule are many and waightie we are bound euen by the bond of nature to maintaine our parents if they be in want because they maintained vs and gaue vnto vs our beeing paul saith it is an honest thing and acceptable before god for children to recompence their parents and progenitors tim nowe if this be so man are bound by the same right to maintaine their spirituall fathers in christ that haue begotten them a new by the preaching of the word as paul saith he trauelled in paine of the galatians till christ was formed in them gal and that he begat onesimus in his bonds philem v and corinthian in christ iesus i haue begotten you through the gospel hence paul commendeth the galatians gal for that if it had beene possible they would haue plucked out their cies and haue giuen them him and surely we owe vnto our spirituall parents and fathers in christ not onely this temporall trash but euen our selues as paul saith to philem v aibeit i doe not say vnto thee that thou owest vnto me euen thine owne selfe ii it is a law of nation and a conclusion grounded vpon common equitie that those that watch labour and spend theselues as a candle to giue light to others and that for the common good of all should be maintained of the common stocke by all and the lord chargeth all the twelue tribes euen all israel deut beware that thou for sakest not the levite so long as thou liuest on the earth iii euery trade calling and condition of life is able to maintaine them that liue therein as experience shewes therefore we may not thinke that the ministerie beeing the highest calling should be so base or barren as that it cannot competenly maintaine them that attend thereupon iv the ministers are the lord souldiers his captaines and standard bearers and therefore are not to goe a warfare at their owne coste the lord labourers in his vineyard and therefore are worthie of their wages and ought to eate of the fruit of the vineyard the lord shepheards set ouer the flocke of christ to feede his sheepe and therefore ought to eate of the milke of the flocke and seeing it was forbidden that no man should muzzle the mouth of the oxe that treadeth out the come shall we thinke that god would haue those that thresh in his floore and separate the wheat from the chaffe the pretious from the vile to be muzzeled or not to liue vpon their labours for they are worthie double honour that is all honour reuerence helpe and furtherance which labour in the word and doctrine tim v the ministers are to giue themselues wholly to reading exhortation doctrine and to continue therein tim they are wholly to deuote themselues to the building of the church and to the fighting of the lord battells and therefore not to be entangled with the cares of this life tim therefore they are to haue their pay and their allowance that so they may attend vpon their callings without distraction vi it is the ordinance of god as paul saith corinthian that they which preach the gospel should liue of the gospel therefore those that doe not their endeauour and inlarge not their liberalitie to vphold and maintaine the ministerie in good estate they withstand as much as in them lieth the ordinance of god besides they wast and make hauocke of the church of god and are guiltie of the blood of all that perish for want of instruction i adde further it is the will of god that the ministers which labour in the word and doctrine should be plentifully and liberally prouided for yet with moderation that they draw not all mens wealth into their purses as the pope and church of rome haue done into their coffers of whome it is truly verified religio peperit divitias sed filia devoravit matrem which i prooue from the leuiticall law for the whole land of promise beeing no bigger in compasse then wales or the fourth part of england yet yeelded vnto the leuites at the appointment of god besides the share which they had out of the sacrifices besides tenths first fruits ampc cities with their suburbs it may here be demaunded whether the ministers of the word are now to be maintained by common contribution and liberalitie of the people or not ans we must consider that if the ministers be sufficiently prouided for by set stipends as by some foundation or by the reuenewes of the church man are not bound to contribute vnto them and make them partakers of all their goods although in regard of thankfulnes they owe vnto them euen themselues as paul telleth philemon but onely such as haue not else wherewith to maintaine themselues and we must consider the reason why paul commandeth all that are instructed in the word to make them that instructed them partakers of their goods to wit because in pauls time and long after the church was not endowed with lands or goods whereby the ministerie might be vpholden neither had it publike christian magistrates but was vnder cruell tyrants in persecution and therefore those that were taught in the word were to maintaine their teachers by liberall cotribution otherwise they might starue but now the church beeing greatly inriched they may without contribution be sufficiently maintained of the church goods and that it is much more conuenient for the ministers to be maintained by set stipends arising from goods proper to the church then by voluntarie contribution it may appeare by this in that it cuts off sundrie inconueniences which in voluntarie contributions either cannot be or are hardly auoided first slatterie and suspition of flatterie in beeing thought to haue some persons in admiration because of aduantage secondly the poorer sort are no way disgraced by this meanes as they should be in contributions except they did giue ratably as the rest thirdly dissembling and deceit in making as though they receiued little when as they haue much is cut off in a set stipend fourthly the euill disposed would not so easily cast off their minister and seeke a new that would teach for lesse or would giue nothing at all if they were touched to the quicke and galled for their sinnes fiftly ostentation in some in giuing much and disdaining those that giue lesse sixtly suspition of couetousnes and filthie lucre in the ministers in seeming to take of those to whome they ought to giue seauenthly disgrace of the ministerie in gathering themselues or sending others to gather the peoples liberalitie from dore to dore lastly a set stipend comes nearer the order appointed by god in maintaining the priesthood vnder the leuiticall law in the next place i will answer the common obiections that are made to the contrarie by such as thinke it is as easie a matter to say seruice in the church as to do seruice in the house to stand at the altar of god as to follow their masters plough to preach in the pulpit as to talke in the tauerne i obiect thess they which will not worke must not eate but ministers neuer plow nor sow nor hedge nor ditch nor vse any painfull labour for of all man they haue the easiest liues their greatest paines is to read ouer a few bookes or to speake a few words once or twise a weeke therefore they are not to be maintained ans there is a twofold labour one of the bodie another of the minde now albeit the ministers doe not wearie themselues in bodily labour yet they are not therefore idle for the labours of the minde doe faire exceede the labours of the bodie they are more painefull they spend the spirits more they consume naturall moisture and bring old age sooner the holy ghost calleth the ministerie the worke of the ministerie ephesians nay a worthie worke tim therefore paul saith that those elders are worthie double honour that labour in the word and doctrine tim and he exhorts the thessalonians that they would know them that labour among them and that they haue them in singular loue for their works sake thess hence it is that the scripture doeth vsually compare the worke of the ministerie to the most toylsome labour that may be as to the work of the husbandman to setting to plowing to sowing to reaping to the labour in the vineyard and the minister to a builder to a shepheard that watcheth his flocke to a soldiour that fighteth in the war ampc againe we may not iudge of the painfulnes of the calling by the outward appearance for so a man would thinke a king had the easiest life of all when as the truth is the toyle which he takes and the cares wherewith he is possessed doe exceede all other cares if a man knew the trauaile that is required to the welding of a scepter and the paine that is taken in wearing of a heauie crowne he would hardly stoope downe to take the one into his hands or to set the other vpon his head the master builder doth not hewe the stones nor worke the morter nor carrie the rubbish nor any such drudgerie but onely standeth by amp directeth the workemen amp yet his labour is double to any of theirs the master of the ship a man would thinke were idle and did nothing he stands not to the tackling he stirreth not the pumpe he driueth not the oares he soundeth not the deepe he rideth not the ropes but onely sitteth still at the sterne and looketh to the pole starre and guideth the compasse yet his labour passeth all the rest were it not for him the shippe would runne her selfe vnder the water or strike vpon the rockes or be split vpon the sands or fall soule with another as marriners speake euen so for all the world fareth it with the ministers of the word they seeme to sit still to be at ease to doe nothing and yet their labour is double and treble to other mens bodily labour except they be vnfaithfull and doe the worke of the lord negligently ii obiect paul laboured with his hands in making of tents act that he might not be chargeable to any act thess therefore preachers are to maintaine themselues by their handy labour amp not be chargeable to the church ans pauls example prooueth not that the minister ought to liue by the labour of his hads for first himselfe receiued a contribution of the philippians when he was absent fro them philip when i was in thessalonica ye sent once and afterward againe for my necessitie therefore if paul receiued exhibition from other churches where he did not labour it is lawefull for the ministers to receiue of those whome they doe instruct secondly consider the reasons why paul would not take wages of the church of corinthian amp some others i lest he should be a burden vnto them thess we wrought with labour and trauell day and night because we would not be chargeable to any of you corinthian in all things i kept and will keepe my selfe that i should not be grieuous vnto you ii that he might giue a president or example to others to tread in his steppes thess not but that we had authoritie but that we might make our selues an example to them to follow vs iii that he might manifest what his end was in teaching the gospel not to seeke himselfe but the saluation of his hearers corinthian i seeke not yours but you and verse we doe all things for your edification philip not that i desire a gift but the fruit which may further your reckening iv that he might confound the false apostles which taught not freely but receiued wages for their labour whereas he receiued none or lest they should slaunder him and his ministery if he should receiue wages that he did it for filthy lucre corinthian but what i doe that will j doe that i may cut away occasion from them which desire occasion that they might be found like vnto vs in that wherein they reioyce therfore pauls example is altogether impertinent amp prooues nothing for he himselfe tooke wages when as he refused it it was vpon speciall consideration he did not onely permit but also command that the ministers should be maintained iii obiect math freely ye haue receiued freely giue therefore as it was unlawful for the apostles to take any reward for their labour so is it for preachers at this day ans i this text is specially to be vnderstood of the extraordinarie gift of working miracles which christ hauing freely bestowed vpon them he would haue them to vse freely not seeking thereby to enrich themselues by exacting or taking any thing or to winne reputation and glory among man ii if we vnderstand it of the whole ministerie as well of preaching as of working miracles it is to be taken as a precept forbidding only filthy lucre that they should not make marchandize of the word of god setting it to sale in preaching the word with purpose to benefit themselues to feede their bellies or to get a name and reputation in the world which is forbidden in other places as tim tit but for the glory of god the discharge of their duties and the saluation of their hearers great reason there is of this precept because the graces of god exhibited vnto vs in the preaching of the word are so pretious that they cannot be valued at any price all earthly things a man can desire are not to be compared to them as the wise man saith therefore peter said to simon magus thy money perish with thee because thou thinkest that the gift of god may be obtained by money act because it is not in mans power to sell them seeing he is not lord ouer them but steward and dispenser of them corinthian v because that which god hath giuen freely ought not to be sold basely seeing by that meanes that is made saleable which god would haue free which kind of marchandize is vsed in the church of rome at this day in their indulgences wherein they sell pardons for remission of sinnes and set euen heauen it selfe to sale for a small summe of money iii this text must so be expounded as that it crosse not other precepts in this commission and that christ be not contrarie to himselfe which he should be if it were unlawful for preachers to take any thing for their paines for in the verse he saith the workeman is worthy of his meate therefore he may receiue it and verse he enioyns them to enquire in euery towne where they came who is worthy and there abide therefore they were not vtterly barred from taking all necessaries for they might take their lodging their food their raimen with this they were to be content and more then this they might not take though it were offered them or forced vpon them ti elizeus refused the gift offered him by naaman for curing his leprosie least god gifts should be made a ga e or least that which was giuen to set forth god glorie immediately should be an occasion of satisfying mens greedie desires iu obiect math the apostles are forbidden by christ to possesse gold or siluer ampc answer we may not precisely vrge the letter of the text for so we shall make the apostles practise contrarie to christ precept amp so he should condemne himselfe for he had his bagge which iudas bare he had besides his vpper garment ioh and coate without seame ioh luke peter had sandalls act paul had a c oake tim yes christ afterwards saith vnto them but now he that hath a bagge let him take it and likewise a s rip ampc ii it was a temporary precept giuen them in commission only for that present and their going without gold siluer a scrip two coates shooes a staffe signifies that they should goe in haste committing themselues wholly to the prouidence of god not caring for prouision or victuals which is signified by a scrip by siluer amp gold nor of change of raiment signified by two coates nor of defending themselues against violence by the staffe vse here we see that there are two sorts of man in the church some teachers others to be taught called in scripture teachers and hearers the ground of this distinction is taken from the good pleasure of god who hath ordained that man should be taught by man partly because of mans weakenesse who could not endure the glory amp maiestie of god speaking vnto him partly that nothing might be ascribed to the excellencie of the instrument in the conuersion of man but that god might haue all the glorie of it as the apostle speakes corinthian we haue this treasure in earthen vessels that the excellencie of that power might be of god and not of man there is setdown deut v ampc a notable ground for the institution of the holy ministerie by man in stead of god liuely voice from heauen and it was one of the ends which god had in giuing his law in so great maiestie to teach vs that it is for our good that he doth not instruct vs with his owne liuely voice from heauen and speake vnto vs in his owne person and that therefore we should be content nay desirous rather to be taught by man for when the people desired that they might not heare the voice of the lord any more but that moses might speake vnto them the lord answered they haue done well to say so i will raise them vp a prophet from among their brother like vnto thee and i will put my words in his mouth and he shall speake vnto them all that i command him deut this crosseth the curiositie of those who not contenting theselues with the word of god deliuered by the ministerie of man desire that god would speake vnto them with his owne mouth from heauen for the israelites found it by experience that it was a fearefull thing full of horrour and astonishment to heare the voice of god therefore they desire they may heare it no more lest they die deut but the anabaptists obiect that vnder the n t all shall be taught of god ioh v and they shall not teach euery man his neighbour and euery man his brother saying know the lord therefore the publike ministerie is now needlesse ans the wordes must not be vnderstood simply but comparatiuely and synecdochically comparatiuely that there shall be farre greater knowledge vnder the new testament then was vnder the old isa the apostle saith not that there shall be no teaching at all for christ hath giuen some to be prophets others pastors and teachers for the work of the ministerie and the edification of the bodie of christ ephesians but that there shall be no neede of this kind of teaching to catechize them in the first rudiments as to teach them what god is synecdochically not of perfect and absolute knowledge for we all know but in part corinthian but of initiate or inchoate knowledge which shall be consummate in the life to come further vpon this distinction it followeth that hearers are not to intermeddle with the publike duties of the ministerie for euery man is to abide in the calling wherein god hath placed him and therein to liue contented corinthian for no man may take vnto himselfe this honour but he that is called as was aaron heb for albeit it be true which ambrose writeth that in the beginning of the preaching of the gospel amp founding of the church of the new testament all christians did teach and baptize indifferently yet afterward when the churches were founded it was not lawful neither is it now and though there be neither male nor female in christ but we are all one in him gal namely in receiuing of the gospel yet in dispensing of it there is great difference it beeing vnlawefull for a woman to preach or publikely to teach i permit not a woman to teach tim let woman keepe silence in the churches for it is not permitted vnto them to speake corinthian apocrypha this coudemneth the fantasticall opinion of the anabaptists that all man may speake publikely without any difference according to the instinct of the spirit and measure of his gifts againe when paul saith he that is taught in the word ampc him that taught him in the word ampc he shewes what the dutie of the minister is that lookes to liue by his ministerie namely not to feed his auditorie with philosophie or fables or lying legends nor to preach poeticall fictions thalmudicall dreames schoolemens quiddities popish decrees or humane constitutions o to tickle the itching eares of his auditory with the fine ringing sentences of the fathers or what is the cha e to the wheate but he must preach the word of god for there is no word nor writing in the world besides that hath a promise to be the power of god to saluation rom able to make man wise to saluation tim to giue an inheritance amongst them that are sanctified act to be liuely amp mightie in operation sharper then any two edged sword entring through euen to the diuiding asunder of the soule and the spirit the ioynts and the marrow and to be a discerner of the though s and intents of the hearts heb and that can make the man of god absolute to euery good worke tim but onely this word giuen by diuine inspiration it beeing not onely the seed by which we are begotten and borne anew but the food by which we are nourished both milke for the babe that is a nouice in religion and strong meate for him that is of yeares and therefore beeing perfect nourishment the bread of life for him that is hungrie and the water of life for him that is thirstie what needes there any more besides no word nor writing hath the propertie of fire saue onely the word of god to dispell the darknes of ignorance by enlightening the minde with the sauing knowledge of the truth and to h at yes to enflame the affection with a zeale of god glorie by burning vp the corruption of nature againe diuinitie is the mist is all liberall arts tongues historie ampc are but handmaids to attend vpon her now when the mistris is speaking it is good manners for the maide to hold her peace to this word alone the prophets were tied by their commission what i shall command thee that shalt thou say and the apostles you shal teach what i haue comanded you christ himselfe taught nothing but that which he had heard amp receiued of his father ioh paul deliuers nothing but that which he receiued of christ corinthian and taught nothing but that which moses and the prophets had written act paul commads timothie to charge the pastours of ephesus that they teach no diverse doctrine either for matter or manner for substance or circumstance yet here we must take heede of extremities for in some cases it is lawful in preaching to vse philosophie the testimonie of prophane writers and quotations of fathers i when we haue to deale with heathen man who will not be so easily mooued with the authoritie of the scriptures we may conuict them by the testimonie of their owne writers as paul did the athenians epicures and stoikes by the testimonie of aratus act and the cretians by the testimonie of epimenides tit ii in preaching to a mixt congregation where some are infected with popery or some other heresie and will not receiue the doctrine deliuered nor yeeld vnto the truth except it haue the consent of the fathers of the church iii in handling of some controuersall point of diuinitie shewing that the doctrine we teach is no new doctrine but that which was taught in the primitiue church especially in speaking to the weake who haue not as yet left their old superstition wherein they were nuzzeled iiii to cut off the calumniations of the malitious aduersaries who must needes haue their mouthes stopped by some other meanes then by the scriptures v in the necessarie vnfolding of the meaning of certaine places of scripture which without philosophie cannot be conceiued in such a case we may vse humanitie in descending to the reach and capacitie of the auditorie and so teach heauenly things by earthly things as our sauiour christ taught regeneration by the similitude of the winde ioh yet all these must be vsed first sparingly secondly when there is iust cause thirdly without ostentatio fourthly deliuering nothing to the people the ground whereof is not in the word this shewes that the maine scope of the ministerie is to preach the word purely and to applie it powerfully to the consciences of man and it condemnes all deceitfull handling of the word and all huckster like dealing in mingling wine and water together wheat and chaffe gold and drosse in peruerting it with aguish and sottish conceits in wresting it with allegories tropologies and anagogies and in wringing the text till they make it bleede and so as an ancient writer saith presse the two dugges of the scriptures the old and new testament that in stead of milke they drinke nothing but blood this teacheth the hearers likewise to rest contented with the bare word without hungring after new doctrines as the athenians after newes or beeing drawne away from the simplicitie that is in christ by the subtiltie of seducers or by deuises and quiddities of mans braine let those therefore which loath manna amp long for quailes remember that if god giue them their desire he will also giue them their desert let them take heede lest he punish them with a famine not of bread nor a thirst of water but of hearing the word amos and let those that haue itching eares in heaping vp to themselues a multitude of teachers take heede also that they haue not tingling eares when they shall heare of the iudgements of god for the contempt of his word further whereas paul saith he that teacheth is to be maintained it is a good item for all idle drones that will not labour and all dumme dogges that cannot barke they may not expect the maintenance which is due vnto the ministers for it is ge nerally true of all man and much more true of the minister that he which will not labour must not eate and great reason it is that he which looketh for his hire should doe his worke he that would liue of the sacrifice should minister at the altar he that lookes to be fedde with corporall bread should breake vnto his hearers the bread of life he that would reape carnall things should sow spirituall things he that would not haue his mouth muzzeled should thresh out the corne he that would drinke of the wine should plant the grape he that lookes for milke should feede the flocke that is he that will liue of the gospel should teach the gospel it is a maxime not onely of the canon law but grounded vpon the law of nature that beneficium postulat officium a benefit requireth a dutie or more plainly a benefice requireth an office and diligence in the office they therefore that c re not so much for the feeding of the sheepe as for the feeding of themselues and feare not so much the losse of the flocke as the losse of the fleece doe not onely violate the law of god but euen the law of nation and the law of nature againe hence i gather that those that labour in the word and doctrine may lawfully take wages albeit they haue sufficient of their owne to maintaine themselues it is the very equitie of this text for if they that are instructed in the word are to make those that instructed them partakers of their goods then it is lawful for them which instruct and teach to receiue something in recompence of their labour seeing that the labourer is worthie of his wages yet this one caueat must be remembred that if receiuing of wages be a hindrance to the gospel as it would haue beene in paul it is not lawful for we may not so vse our libertie as that we thereby hinder the free course of the gospel we may here further perceiue the great want of deuotion which is in most man of these daies for as the crie of the poore in the streetes and at our dores is an argument that there is no mercie no bowells of pitie and compassion so in that there are so many needie poore wandring leuites which would gladly serue for a morsell of bread or a sute of raiment it is a pregnant proofe there is very small deuotion in man for the maintenance of religion especially in those which are so straight laced and short sleeued in bestowing any thing for the good of the ministerie and yet in keeping of houndes and hawkes and worse matters in maintaining players iesters fooles and such like are very lauish and profuse to their great cost this hath beene the practise of the world and the contemptible estate of the ministerie in former times foure hundred false prophets were richly prouided for at iezabels table king whereas the true prophets of god in the meane time were faine to hide their heads hauing scarse bread and water and that not without daunger well her practise shall condemne a number of professours nay our forefathers zeale and forwardnes notwithstanding they liued in blindnes shall condemne our coldnes in this behalfe what speake i of our forefathers euen the stones in the ruinated abbies and other religious houses shall rise vp in iudgement against vs for those places could maintaine thirtie or fourtie idle bellies which did nothing but nuzzle man in superstitious idolatry whereas now the same place will not competently maintaine one or two to instruct them in the way to eternall life and no maruaile for we take from the church as fast as they gaue to it in old time they were wont to say what shall we giue the man of god sam but now with the sacrilegious church robbers they say come and let vs take the houses of god in possession psalm the iewes were exceeding forward and liberall in their contribution to the tabernacle some brought gold others siluer silk pretious stone the meaner sort rammes skinnes goats haire ampc so that more the enough was offered by the in such sort that moses was forced to cause a proclamation to be made to stay the people from offer exod this their example in beeing so forward to contribute to the materiall temple shall condemne our backwardnes in conferring so little to the ministers who are the liuing temples of god and to the ministerie which is in the place of the altar for looke by how much god hath diminished the cost of the altar and the charges of the ceremoniall worship vnder the old testament by so much more doth he require the ministerie to be maintained and spirituall worship furthered in the new lastly if they that doe not put too their helping hand to vphold the ministerie are to be condemned what condemnation trow we the belongs to sacrilegious persons that robbe the church of her reuenewes and deuoure holy things be not deceiued god is not mocked for whatsoeuer a man soweth that shall he also reape here the apostle preuenteth sundrie secret obiections against the former precept v for the galatians might plead for themselues in this manner whereas thou enioynest vs to make those which instructed vs in the word partakers of all our goods alas we cannot doe it it is an vnreasonable thing thou exactest of vs for as for some of vs we haue a great familie and charge to looke vnto wife and children to prouide for and for them we must prouide otherwise we dente the faith and are worse then infidells tim others are poore and needie fitter a great deale to receiue then to giue and those that can giue are not so to giue that others may be eased and they theselues pinched corinthian and as for the ministers themselues many of them are couetous and insatiable and therefore it is euill spent that is bestowed vpon them some of them need not and therfore we neede not to giue and why doe not those that are needie follow pauls example who laboured with his hands and got his liuing by making of tents because he would not be chargeable vnto any or why doe they not lead a single life as in former times they did that so they may be lesse burdensome to the church and more beneficial to their brother besides all this god hath promised he will be the portion and inheritance of the leuites and therefore we neede not be so hastie to share with them in all our goods to these and all other vaine and friuolous excuses of the same kind made by worldlings of corrupted minds the apostle answereth in these words be not deceiued god is not mocked as if he should say i know right well you are very cunning in seeking out shifts and pretending reasons to excuse your faults and to exempt your selues from the preformance of the former duty and so to couer the cursed couetuousnes of your harts with colorable excuses but be not deceiued brother they are but figg leaues you do but danse in a nette you cannot bleare the all seeing eyes of god howsoeuer these reasons may perswade you amp go for currant with man yet they are but counterfaite in god ostimate with whome you haue to deale who is not mocked nor cannot be deceiued nor will not be deluded with such vaine excuses therefore take heed lest in going about to deceiue them you deceiue your selues for looke how you deale with them god will deale with you amp with what measure you mete vnto them the same he will measure to you againe for as you sovve so shall you reape so that in these words the apostle doth summarily comprise these three things first a disswasion from this their vaine reasoning and wicked practise laid downe by way of preuention be not deceiued secondly a reason of the dehortation shewing that these their excuses are but friuolous and vaine god is not mocked thirdly a confirmation or proofe of his former reason for whatsoeuer a man soweth that shall be reape the disswasion is laid downe in these words be not deceiued the like phrase of speech we haue in sundry other places as in that aduertisement which hezekiah giueth the leuites chronicle now my sonnes be not deceiued and paul the corinthians corinthian be not deceiued neither fornicators ampc corinthian be not deceiued euill speeches corrupt good manners now man erre and are deceiued sundry waies both in diuine and humane things which appertaine not to this place touching the deceit here mentioned we are to know that a man may be deceiued and that by himselfe two waies first through ignorance in iudging that to be no finne which is a sinne as when a man is perswaded that god is to be worshipped in an image that when he persecutes the saints of god he doth god good seruice secondly when man are so wickedly willfull that they wittingly deceiue themselues in thinking they can deceiue god himselfe and so cunningly handle the matter that he shall not know their words nor see their works nor vnderstand their thoughts that whether they do good or euill giue to the ministery or not liue according to the flesh or according to the spirit it is all one seeing he considereth it not and so promise to themselues impunity though they inne willingly as eue did in putting a peraduenture where god threat was peremptorie both these sorts of deceit are here vnderstood specially the latter use hence we may obserue the deceitfulnes of sinne which maketh man thinke all is well with them and that there is no danger ampc when the case is farre otherwise this shewes that the heart of man is deceitfull aboue measure as the prophet saith who can finde it out or who can sound the depth of the deceit of his owne heart or who knows the infinite windings and turnings which are in this intricate labyrinth now this commeth to passe partly by reason of originall corruption which the apostle saith is deceitfull hebr take heede lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulnes of sinne partly by reason of long custome in sinne whereby the heart is inured to deceit psalm blessed is the manin whose spirit there is no guile for from this double ground it commeth to passe that man are so wittie in defrauding the ministers of their due in cutting them short of their allowance in embezeling and purloining from them what they can and so ingenious in inuenting probable reasons and plausible arguments to deceiue themselues withall in accounting all to be gained that is thus gotten this teacheth vs first of all to pray instantly that god would open our eyes that we may see our hidden corruptions and that he would annoint them with the eye salue of his spirit that we may clearely see and rightly discerne of things that differ considering that sinne doth often apparell it selfe with the cloake of vertue secondly we are to suspect our selues of our secret sinnes and to aggraua e our knowne sinnes by all circumstances seeing we may so easily deceiue our selues in flattering our selues to be cleare of this or that sinne or at least not to be so grieuous sinners as in truth we are thirdly that it is the dutie of the minister to warne the people to take heed that they be not deceiued as paul doth ephesians let no man deceiue you with vaine words for for such things commeth the wrath of god vpon the children of disobedience againe hence i gather that in the prime of the church in the apostles daies when the church of the new testament was but in founding the ministerie was in contempt and as it may appeare out of other places the ministers were not onely neglected or contemned but reuiled persecuted accounted as the fi th of the world and the of skouring of all things corinthian or where they were better intreated they were but abused scorned reputed brain sicke fellowes as the prophet was king and paul act this hath beene and is the account which the world maketh of the ministers of god which must be so farre from discouraging vs that it should minister rather matter of ioy vnto vs in that we are conformable by this meanes to christ our head who was not onely neglected of all not hauing where to rest his head luke but laughed to skorne accounted a pot companion a drunkard and a glutton a sorcerer one that had a deuill and was madde ioh for if we suffer with him we shall be glorified with him rom thus much of the dehortation the reason followes to be considered in the second place in these wordes god is not mocked where the apostle shewes that their excuses are but vaine because god is not mocked nor will not be deluded with such pretenses first here the apostles dealing is worthy to be obserued in that reproouing them which neglected their dutie to the ministers of the word he bringeth in god himselfe taking the matter into his owne hand making the ministers quarrell his owne quarrell and this he doth to the end we might see whom we haue to deale withall and whom we do abuse when we abuse the ministers of the word to witt that we abuse not man but god for albeit it be true of all and euery sinne which dauid confesseth of his owne particular murther and adultery that it is against god yes against him alone psalm yet in these and such like cases which tend to the vndermining of his church and the decay of his religion and worship he taketh himselfe more directly aimed at and more nearely touched when the israelites refused to haue samuell and his sonnes to rule ouer them the lord saith they haue not cast thee away but they haue cast me away that i should not raigne ouer them sam when the leuites were defrauded of their due the lord by his prophet telleth the people ye haue spoiled me in tithes amp offerings mal so in this place when the galatians did wrongfully withhold and keepe backe that competent allowance that was due to their teachers he telleth them that it was a sinne tending against god who is not nor will not nor cannot be mocked for what wrong soeuer is done to the messenger that is sent the same is done to his lord that sent him amp whatsoeuer disgrace or indignitie is offered an embassadour the same redounds to the prince whose embassadour he is this ought to be a caueat vnto vs to take heed howe we contemne or neglect the ministers of god seeing whatsoeuer wrong is done them christ takes it as done to himselfe matth act this lets vs see the hainous sinnes of many that professe the gospel specially in this kind who now at this day if euer are ingenious in defrauding and eloquent in declaiming against the ministers of the word in laughing them to skorne as they did our sauiour christ mark and abusing them in tearmes and taunts calling them bald priests as young children called elizeus balde pale no doubt following the example of their parents of whome they learned it ascend thou balde pate ascend thou balde pate king that they are too full of the spirit as they derided the apostles in saying they were full of newe wine act in making them their table talke making songs of them as the drunkards did of dauid and ieremie in scourging them with the whippe of the tongue as the stoicks called paul a babbler act and festus a madde man act nowe in that they thus scornefully abuse his ministers and so indignely and disdainefully intreat his messengers and embassadours what doe they els but abuse christ iesus himselfe and through their sides wound and crucifie him againe when sanacherib king of ashur reuiled ierusalem amp hezekiah the king what saies the lord o virgin daughter of sion he hath despised thee and laughed thee to skorne o daughter of ierusalem he hath shaken his head at thee whome hast thou railedon and blasphemed and against whome hast thou exalted thy voice and lifted vp thine eies on high euen against the holy one of israel esay v the vse hece we learne that god hath an exact knowledge of all our actions amp cannot be deluded prou hell and destruction are before him how much more ampc psalm his eies consider his eie liddes trie the children of man psalm v he knowes our thoughts long before they be hebr all things are naked and bate in his sight reason it selfe shewes that he which made the cie cannot but see he that made the heart and minde cannot but vnderstand the frame amp motion thereof psalm v ampc ii this shewes the madnesse of those which say god heareth not seeth not vnderstandeth not or which say in their hearts how should he heare is their knowledge in the most high or can he see through the thicke cloud iii hence we are taught in our praiers to power forth our hearts before the lord without concealing so much as the least sinne seeing we may easily delude man and deceiue our selues but god we cannot deceiue iv it ought to be a bridle to vs to curbe and keepe in our corruptions considering his eies pierce the darknesse the most secret and hidden places yes euen the secret closets and cabinets of our hearts thus much of the reason i proceed to the confirmation or proofe of his reason in these words for whatsoeuer a man soweth that shall he also reape where the apostle prooues that god will not be mocked with vaine excuses seeing he will render to euery man according to his workes which is signified by this allegoricall speech of sowing and reaping so often vsed in scripture as corinthian cor in which places labour and cost in doing good and being beneficiall specially to the ministers of the word is compared to seed the workers to seedsmen the ministers to whome this benefit is conferred to the tilled ground the gaine that accrewes vnto them thereby to the haruest wherewith god will reward them and that according to their workes in the generall day of retribution this metaphor of sowing doeth elsewhere signifie all the morall actions of a mans life whether they be good or euill of good actions salomon saith he that soweth righteousnesse hath a sure recompence prou of euill actions he saith he that soweth iniquitie shall reape affliction prou but here paul restraines it to those good workes of liberalitie which are performed in the maintenance of the ministerie and he calleth that which is bestowed vpon the ministers of the word seede which beeing sowne doeth recompence the cost thirtie sixtie an hundred fold that so they might not think their labor lost nor their cost bestowed in vaine seeing they were to receiue that which they laid forth with aduantage but here it may be said this prouerbiall sentence is not alwaie true for sometime man sowe much amp gather but litle deut agg nay sometime they sowe and reape not mich againe experience shewes that that which is sowen may degenerate into another kind ans it is not necessarie that prouerbiall sentences should be true at all times and in euery particular if they be true for the most part or in that for which they are brought it is sufficient as that matth a prophet is not accepted in his owne country is for the most part true though not alwaies so whatsoeuer a man soweth the same commonly and vsually he doeth reape but it will be said howe can a man reape that which he soweth seeing that christ affirmeth it to be a true saying that one soweth and another reapeth ioh ans in that one soweth and another reapeth it is not to bee imputed to nature but to the speciall prouidence of god the words are to be vnderstood of the prophets who were the seedsmen in sowing the seedes of the gospel amp of the apostles who were the reapers whose plaine and powerfull preaching of the gospel did as farre exceede that of the prophets as the haruest doth the seed time thus the time vnder the law is resembled to childhood and infancie that vnder the gospell to mans estate gal ampc againe it may be said the husbandman soweth not the body that shall be corinthian therefore he reapeth not that which he sowed ans he reapeth not the same indiuiduall but yet the same specificall bodie it may further be doubted of the trueth of that which is signified by this prouerbiall sentence namely whether euery man shal receiue according to his workes for so euery man should be condemned to which i answer that it is not vniuersally true for if the righteous commit iniquitie all his righteousnesse shall be no more remembred and if a wicked man turne from his sinne none of his sinnes that he hath committed shall be mentioned vnto him ezeck it must therefore be restrained thus he that doeth wickedly and perseuereth therein to the ende he that doeth well and continueth in well doing shall receiue according to his workes the seedes of his former sinnes shall not growe vp to the haruest of condemnation for it is the priuiledge yes the happinesse of a righteous man so to haue his finnes couered with the robes of christ his righteousnesse as that they shall neuer be vncouered to his shame psalm esay againe it may hence be prooued in that sanctification in death is perfected originall corruption beeing vtterly abolished and therefore though the booke of a regenerate mans conscience be opened at the day of iudgement yet nothing shall be found in it but his good workes which follow him till the resurrection apocrypha besides this in the last sentence pronounced by our sauiour christ math only their good workes are mentioned come ye blessed of my father inherit the kingdome prepared for you for i was hungrie and ye fedde me ampc their sinnes and imperfections not so much as once named but concealed and passed ouer ii obiect it may be said that neither the good nor the bad doe reape that which they haue sowne the godly for the seed of good works reape nothing but affliction the wicked for the cursed seed of a damnable life comfort and contentation to which i answer that it is not true if we restraine it to the tearme of this life for so all man reape not as they haue sowne but it is vndoubtedly true of the life to come for the iustice of god requires that all should be rewarded according to their workes rom hence therefore we may gather that seeing man must reape as they sow and yet doe not reape nor receiue their reward in this life that there is another life after this in which god will giue to euery one as his workes shall be and therfore there shall be a iudgement and because the bodie was partaker with the soule either in doing good or euill it is iust likewise it should be partaker either of miserie or felicitie and therefore there shall be a resurrection iii obiect the whore of babylon must be rewarded double apocrypha in the cuppe that shee hath filled to you fill her the donble and the saints pray thus to god render to our neighbours seuenfold into their bosome psalm therefore it seemeth that some man shall not be iudged according to their works because they are punished aboue their deserts ans shee is rewarded double yet not aboue but according to her deserts giue her double according to her workes v the meaning is not that shee should be punished twise as much as shee had deserued for it is the law of god that the malefactour should be beaten with a certaine number of stripes not aboue but according to his trespasse deut but that shee should be tormented twise as much as shee had tormented others againe these phrases and formes of speech of rewarding double or seuen fold signifie that god will pay wicked man whome to the full a definite number beeing put for an indefinite as gen doubtlesse whosoeuer slaieth cain shall be punished seuen fold the meaning is not that the murtherer of cain should be punished seuen fold more then he was punished for killing his brother abel for it should not haue beene so great a sinne for a man to haue killed him as it was for him to kill his brother but that he should be most seuerely and grieuously punished iiii obiect infants haue no works whereby they may be iudged seeing they doe neither good nor euill as the scripture speaketh of iacob and esau rom therefore all shall not be iudged according to workes ans these phrases of scripture as a man sowes so shall be reape euery one shall receiue according to his workes ampc are not to be extended to all but must be restrained to such as haue works amp knowledge to discerne between good and euill which infants haue not for besides that they are destitute of workes they also want the vse of reason and therefore they shall not be iudged by the booke of conscience but by the booke of life for to say as hugo de s vict doth vpon the rom quaest that they shall be condemned for the sinnes which their parents committed in their conception and natiuitie as though they themselues had actually committed them is contrarie to that ezek the son shall not beare the iniquitie of the father u obiect but how shall they be pronounced iust who beeing come to yeares of discretion yet haue no good works as lazarus and the theefe vpon the crosse who liuing leudly all his life long was converted at the last gaspe ans that lazarus had no good works whereby he might be declared iust it cannot be prooued the contrarie rather may be gathered out of scripture and that the good theefe had no good works it is flit against the text luke where he maketh a notable confession of christ and rebuketh his fellow labouring to bring him to the faith which was a memorable fact of christian charitie secondly though it were graunted that they had no good works in action yet they were full of good workes in affection and by these they were to be iudged god accepting in his children the will for the deede lazarus by reason of his extreame pouertie and the theefe by reason of the shortnes of time which he had to liue in the world could not be plentifull in good workes thereby to giue sufficient testimonie of their vnfained faith yet god accepteth a man according to that which he hath and not according to that which he hath not accepting the will for the deede as he accepted the willingnes of abraham to sacrifice his son as though he had sacrificed him indeede gen vi obiect god doth not proportionate the reward to the worke because he doth reward works which are finite amp temporall with infinite and eternall punishment ans sinne beeing considered in respect of the act as it is a transient action is finite but in a threefold confideration it is infinite first in respect of the obiect against whome it is committed for beeing the offence of an infinite maiestie it doth deserue infinite punishment for if he that clippes the kings coyne or defaceth the kings armes or counterfaitet the broad seale of england or the princes priuie seale ought to die as a traytour because this disgrace tendeth to the person of the prince much more ought he that violates the law of god die the first and second death seeing the breach thereof doth not onely tend to the defacing of his owne image in vs but to the person of god himselfe who in euery sinne is contemned and dishonoured secondly sinne is infinite in respect of the subiect for seeing that the soule is immortall and that the guilt of sinne and the blot together doe staine the soule as the crim in or ska let die the silk or the wooll and can no more be seuered from the soule then spots from the leopard it remaineth that sinne is infinite in durance and so deserueth eternall punishment thirdly it is infinite in respect of the minde desire and intent of the sinner whose desire is still to walke on in his sinnes and except god should cut off the line of his life neuer to giue ouer sinning but to runne on in infinitum committing of sinne euen with greedinesse thus hauing the meaning of the words let vs come to the doctrine and vse there be two principall reasons which hinder man from beeing beneficiall and liberall to the ministerie the first is because they thinke all is lost that is bestowed that way the second is because they are afraid lest themselues should want to both which the apostle makes answer in this place comparing our beneficence in the vpholding maintaining countenancing of the ministerie to seede to teach vs that as the husbandman doth sow his corne in the ground neuer fearing the losse thereof but hoping for a greater increase not doubting his owne want but assuring himselfe of greater plentie so we in sowing the seedes of good works must neuer dreame of losse or cost considering the more we sowe the more we shall reape we must neuer feare want seeing we shall receiue an hundred fold mark if man could be perswaded of this that the time of this life is the seede time that the last iudgement is the haruest and that as certenly as the husbandman which sowes his seede lookes for increase so we for our good workes a recompence to the full o how fruitfull should we be how plentifull how full of good works but the cursed roote of infidelitie which is in euery man by nature doth drie vp the sappe of all god graces in vs and make vs either bad or barren trees either to bring forth sowre fruits of sinne or no fruit at all but to become vnprofitable both to our selues and others for the reason why man are so cold in their liberalitie so fruitlesse so vnprofitable is because they doe not beleeue the promises of god that he is true of his word that whatsoeuer they giue to the poore or the ministers of his word they lend vnto the lord and whatsoeuer they lay out the lord will restore to them againe prou for if they were as wel perswaded of a recompence at the last day as the husbandman is of a haruest they would be more frequent in duties of charitie and more plentifull in good workes then commonly they be further let it be obserued that though these words be but generally expouded in the verse folowing where the apostle saith he that soweth to the flesh shall of the flesh reape corruption e that soweth to the spirit shall of the spirit reap life euerlasting yet are they more particularly and distinctly set downe elswhere in scripture as corinthian he that soweth sparingly shall reape sparingly and he that soweth liberally shall reape liberally that is the haruest shall not onely be answerable to the seede and the reward to the worke but greater or lesse according to the quantitie and qualitie of the worke for euery man shall receiue his reward according to his proper labour corinthian for the more the husbandman sowes the more he doth vsually reape except god blow vpon it in cursing the land as he did the israelites who sowed much and gathered but little and the lesse he sows the lesse shall his croppe be euen so the more plentifull we are in sowing the seedes of good workes the more we shall reape and the more sparing we are the lesse shall our haruest be hence i gather first that there are seuerall degrees of punishmentsin hell according to the greatnes and smalnes of sinnes for some sinnes are but as mo es others as beames matth some as gnats others as camells matth and therefore some shall be beaten with many stripes some with few and it shall be easier for them of sodo and gomortha at the day of iudgement then for them of capernaum secondly that there are sundrie degrees of glorie and felicitie in heauen proportionall to mens works for all man doe not sow alike neither are their workes equall but haue sund e degrees of goodnes in them and therefore there are answerable degrees of glorie wherewith they are to be crowned this truth is taught elsewhere more plainly as daniel they that be wise shall shine as the brightnes of the firmament and they that turne many to righteousnes shall shine as the starres for euermore therefore as there is a greater brightnes in the starre then in the firmament so there shall be greater glorie in one then in another corinthian euery man shall receiue his reward according to his owne labour therefore seeing all mens labours are not alike their reward shall not be alike this is further confirmed by the parable of the talents luke where the master of the servant doth proportionate his wages to their worke making him that had gained with his talent fiue talents ruler ouer fiue cities him that had gained te ruler ouer tenne and whereas it may be said that all the labourers in the vineyard receiued an equall reward namely a pennie as well as those that wrought but an houre or those that bare the burden and heate of the day i answer it is true of essentiall glorie all the elect shall haue equall glorie but it is not true of accidentall glorie therein all shall not equall take sundrie vessels of diverse bignesse and cast them in to the sea all will be filled with water though some receiue a greater quantitie others a lesse so all shall haue fulnesse of glorie that is the same essentiall glorie though in respect of accidentall glorie some shall haue more and some lesse secondly the scope of the parable is not to shewe the equalitie of glorie in the world to come but that they which are first called ought not to insult ouer their brother which are not as yet called seeing they may be preferred before them or at the least made equall with them it remaineth therefore for a conclusion that there shall be degrees of glorie in heauen as there are degrees of torments in hell and that as mens labours differ in goodnes so their rewards shall be different in greatnesse nowe mens labours differ in goodnesse three waies in the kinde in the quantitie and in the qualitie in the kind in that some are more noble in their kinde some more base as to cure the maladies of the soule is a more excellent worke in it kinde then to cure the diseases of the bod e and therefore it hath a greater degree of glorie prom ed daniel they that turne many to righteousnes shall shine as the starres for euermore in the qualitie or manner in that some are done with greater loue some with lesse some with greater zeale some with lesse some with greater care and conscience to discharge our duties some with lesse now those that are performed with greater loue zeale care and conscience shall ece ue a greater reward tho e that are done with lesse a less for so is the promise euery man shall receiue his wages according to his owne labour corinthian in the quantitie in that some labour but an houre others beare the burden and hea e of the day and so according to the greatnes or s alnes of their paines they shall haue a greater or less reward he that had so carefully emplo ed his talent that he gained with it ten others was made ruler ouer ten cities and he that had taken lesse paines and gained bu ue was made but ruler ouer fiue that is had his reward yet a lesse reward sutable to his worke further as god doth reward the good workes of his servant according to the kind the quantitie and qualitie so he rewardeth sinnes not onely according to their degree as we haue heard but also in the same manner according to the nature and qualitie of the sinne thess it is a iust thing with god to recompence tribulation to them that trouble you thus he threatneth that to the froward he will shew himselfe froward psalm and he that sheddeth mans blood by man shall his blood be shedde gen and all that take the sword shall perish by the sword matth and he that stoppeth his eares at the crie of the poore shall crie vnto the lord and he will not heare him pro and iudgement mercilesse shall be to him that shewes no mercie iam and woe be to thee that spoilest and wast not spoiled and doest wickedly and they did not wickedly against thee for when thou shalt cease to spoile thou shalt be spoiled and when thou shalt make an ende of doing wickedly they shall doe wickedly against thee isaiah for with what iudgement man iudg they shall be iudged and with what measure they mere it shall be measured to them againe matth neither doth god barely threaten this but he doth it in deede in handling sinners in their kind gen because thou hast eaten of the tree cursed is the earth for thy sake in sorrow shalt thou eate of it all the daies of thy life thus god punished the filthie sodomites in their kind in that for their burning lust he rained vpon them fire and brimstone from heauen gen nadab and abihu censing with strange fire were consumed with fire from heauen numb the like may be said of adonibezek for as he caused seuentie kings hauing the thumbs of their hands and of their feete cut off to gather crummes vnder his table so the lord rewarded him iud as agags sword made woman childlesse so his mother was made childlesse among other woman beeing hewen in peeces before the lord in gilgal sam thus god punished the adulterie and murther of dauid for as he defiled an others mans wife so his owne son absolom defiled his wiues in the sight of all israel sam amp his murther in slaying vriah by the sword of the childre of ammo in that the sword did neuer depart fro his house sam because the grecians accouted preaching foolishnes it pleased god as a fit amp iust punishment of this their sin by the foolishnes of preaching to saue the that beleeue corinthian thus as chrysost hath obserued the rich glutton was met with in his kind for wheras he would not giue lazarus a crumme of bread to slake his hunger god would not giue him a droppe of water to coole his thirst luke and therefore he saith hieme non seminavit misericordiam venit aestas amp nihil messuit thus he punisheth spirituall fornication with bodily pollution because the israelites went a whoring from god therefore their daughters became harlots and their spouses whores hos and this is verified in the church of rome at this day for as he gaue vp the heathen to reprobate minds by reason of their idolatry so hath he giuen them vp as we may see in their vncleane cloysters their sodomiticall stewes their beastly brothelhouses and the like so they that delight in looking at the rednesse of the wine shall haue red eies as a punishment of their sinne pro thus god punished the pride of the woman of ierusalem for in stead of a sweete sauour there was a stinke in stead of agirdle a rent in stead of dressing of the haire baldnes in stead of a stomager a girding of sacke cloth and burning in stead of beautie isaiah and thus the lord shut vp euery wombe of the house of abimelech because of sara abrahams wife gen thus the wise man saith because the israelites worshipped serpents which had not the vse of reason and vile beast the lord sent a multitude of vnreasonable beast among them for a vengeance that they might know that wherewith a man sinneth by the same also shall he be punished wisd and this manner of punishing sinners in their kinde iob acknowledgeth to be most iust when he saith if mine heart haue beene deceiued by a woman or if i haue laid waite an the dore of my neighbour let my wife grind vnto another man and let other man bow downe vpon her iob use first here we see the iustice of god in awarding the last sentence nay his bountie and seueritie his bountie in recompencing man aboue their deserts his seueritie in punishing sinners according to their deserts for as he will denie any thing in iustice that denied to diues a droppe of water to coole his tongue luke so he will recompence any thing in mercie that will recompence a cuppe of cold water math this integritie in iudgement without partialitie is signified by the white throne reu and it serues as a patterne and example for all iudges and magistrats to follow in laying iudgement to the rule and righteousnes to the ballance isaiah that is in hearing causes indifferently and determining equally examining them as it were by line and square as the mason or carpenter doth his worke the grecians placed iustice between leo and libra thereby signifying that there must not onely be courage in executing but also indifferencie in determining the egyptians expresse the same by the hieroglyphicall figure of a man without hands winking with his eyes whereby is meant our vncorrupt iudge who hath no hands to receiue bribes nor eyes to behold the person of the poore or respect the person of the rich and before our tribunalls we commonly haue the picture of a man holding a ballance in one hand and a sword in the other signifying by the ballance iust iudgement by the sword execution of iudgement for as the balance putteth no difference betweene gold and lead but giueth an equall or vnequall poise to them both not giuing a greater waight to the gold for the excellencie of the mettall because it is gold nor a lesse to the lead for the basenes of it because it is lead so they were with an euen hand to way the poore mans cause as well as the rich but it is most notably set out by the throne of the house of dauid mentioned psalm which was placed in the gate of the citie towardes the sun rising in the gate to signifie that all which came in and out by the gate of the citie might indifferently be heard the poore as well as the rich and might haue accesse and regresse too and from the iudgement seate towards the rising of the sun in token that their iudgement should be as cleare from corruption as the sun is cleare in his chiefest brightnes secondly this confutes the common opinion of the schoolmen who as they truly affirme that god rewardeth his elect supra meritum aboue their desert so they erroniously teach that he punisheth the reprobate citra condignum lesse then they haue deserued for god powreth vpon the wicked after this life the full violls of his wrath punishing them in the rigour of his iustice without all mercie not onely according to their works in regard of the nature and qualitie but in respect of the measure and quantitie lastly this doctrine seriously considered and thought vpon that we shall drinke such as we brew reape such as we sow and that man shall haue degrees of felicitie or miserie answerable to their workes answerable to the kind of their worke to the quantitie and qualitie thereof will make vs more carefull to auoid sinne and to be more plentifull in good workes then if with the papists we should teach iustification by workes againe in that euery one shall reape as he soweth that is shall be rewarded not according to the fruit and successe of his labour but according to his labour be it more or lesse better or worse it serues first of all to comfort the ministers of the word which are set ouer a blinde ignorant people who are alwaie learning and neuer come to the knowledge of the th they must not be discouraged thogh after long teaching there be little knowledge or amendment after much paines little profiting but rather a coldnesse a backewardnesse a decl ning in all sorts and degrees they must remember that if their gospell beeing deliuered with such simpheitie with such assidu tie with such euidence and demonstration of the spirit be h d at is hid to them that perish in whome the god of this world hath blinded the mindes of the infidells that the glorious gospel of christ should not shine vnto them corinthian besides let them consider that though they seeme to labour in vaine amp to spend their strength in vaine and that their words take no more effect then if they were spoken in the winde yet that their iudgement is with the lord and their worke with their god isa remembring that god wil giue to euery man according to his worke according to the kind the quantitie the qualitie thereof and not according to the fruit or successe of his worke it may serue also as a cordiall to euery man that is painfull amp faithful in his calling thogh neuer so base amp seruile as to a shepheard which watcheth his flock or a poore drudge that atteds vpon his masters busines he is to cofort himselfe with this that though he see no great good that comes by his labour and trauel yet if he be obediet to him that is his master according to the flesh in all things not with eye seruice as man pleasers but in singlenes of heart seruing god and whatsoeuer he doth doing it heartily as to the lord and not to man let him know and assure himsel e that of the lord he shall receiue the reward of inheritance coloss and the promise is more generall ephesians know ye that whatsoeuer good thing any man doth the same shall he receiue of the lord whether he be bond or free it serueth further as a comfort against inequallitie whereas the wicked flourish in all manner of prosperitie and the godly lie in contempt and miserie for the time shall come when euery one shall reape euen as he hath sowne when god will punish the sinnes of the reprobate with eternall torment according to their deserts and crowne the good workes of his servant with an eternall waight of glorie aboue their desert for pietie shall not alway goe vnrewarded neither shall impietie alway goe vnpunished for as the psalmist saith the patient abiding of the righteous shall not perish for euer and againe doubtles there is a reward for the righteous doubtlesse there is a god that iudgeth the earth againe this condemneth the damnable opinion of atheists who thinke all things come to passe by nature or fortune and that doomes day is but a dreame and that sticke not to say it is in vaine to serue god and what profit is it that we haue kept his commadements and that we haue walked humbly before the lord of boasts as though good workes should neuer be rewarded nor sinne punished albeit the lord hath said behold i come quickly and my reward is with me to giue to euery one as his works shall be apocrypha besides it meeteth with the practise of those man which sowe nothing but cock e and yet expect a croppe of wheates or nothing but darnell and yet looke to reape a barly haruest that is such as sowe nothing but the cursed seed of a damnable life and yet looke to reape the haruest of eternall life for as a man soweth so shall he reape such as he brueth such shall he drinke euery one shall eate the fruit of his owne waies and be filled with his owne deuises prou it doeth further detect the follie of those which fraught the shippe of their soule with nothing but faith resting in carnall presumption vpon a vaine opinion of faith and neuer caring for good workes against whome saint iames writeth chap v what auaileth it though a man say he hath faith when he hath no workes can the faith saue him wilt thou vnderstand o thou vaine man that faith which is without workes is dead we must therefore sowe the seedes of good workes in this life if after this life we looke to reape the haruest of eternall life amp giue all diligence by good workes to make our calling and election sure that as it is sure in it selfe in god vnchangeable decree tim so we may make it sure to vs pet and so lay vp in store a good foundation against the time to come that we may obtaine eternall life tim lastly it crosseth the wicked conceipt and imagination of those man that sing a requiem to their soules in promising to themselues an impunitie from sinne and an immunitie from all the iudgements of god notwithstanding they goe on in their bad practises and all because god doth not presently take vengeance on them for their sinnes for they do not consider that their sinnes are as seedes which must haue a time to growe in before they come to maturitie but beeing once ripe and fulleared let them assure themselues god will cut them downe with the sickle of his iudgements as we read gen they remember not what the lord saith by ieremie that he will not wearie himselfe with following after these wild asses vsed to the wildernesse which snuffe vp the winde by occasion at their pleasure and none can turne them backe but will seeke for them and finde them in their moneths that is when their iniquitie shall be at the full the lord will meete with them for he that soweth to the flesh shall of the flesh reape corruption but he that soweth to the spirit shall of the spirit reape life euerlasting here saint paul specifieth that in particular which before he had deliuered in generall vz what he meant by sowing and reaping and this he doth by a distribution or enumeration of the kindes of sowing and reaping she wing that there are two sorts of seed which man sow in this life good and euill two kinds of sowers spirituall man and carnall man two sorts of ground in which this seede is sowne the flesh and the spirit two sorts of haruests which man are to reape according to the seede corruption and life as paul saith if ye liue after the flesh ye shall die but if ye mortifie the deedes of the bodie by the spirit ye shall liue rom these two sorts of haruests beeing answerable to the seede corruption and death beeing the haruest of the seede sowne to the flesh life and immortalitie of that to the spirit tacianus the hereticke and author of the sect of the encratites doth gather from this and the like places that marriage is in it selfe simply euill because it is a sowing to the flesh to him we may adioyne the popes holinesse syricius who reasoneth after the same manner to prooue that priestes ought not to marrie because saith he they that are in the flesh cannot please god rom where he condemneth all marriages as vncleane both in the cleargie and the laitie distinct vnderstanding as though paul should speake properly of seed and of the flesh but worthely was tacianus his opinion confuted and he condemned for an hereticke for the apostle speaketh not of the workes of nature but of corrupt nature which ouerturneth the diuine order which god set in nature in the creation besides the apostolike writer saith that marriage is honourable among all man not the first onely but also the second third ampc and among cleargie man as well as others and therefore the marriage bed beeing vndefiled that is beeing vsed in holy manner is no sowing to the flesh but to the spirit as popish catharinus in comment in bunc locum doctours are enforced to confesse lastly paul saith not he that soweth to the flesh shall of the flesh reape corruption but he that soweth to his flesh ampc now no man except he be worse then a bruit beast doth abuse himselfe by sowing to his owne flesh as ierome saith vpon this place others by sowing to the flesh and spirit vnderstand the following after the fruites of the flesh and of the spirit mentioned in the former chapter verse but this exposition cannot stand in this place because the illatiue particle for in the beginning of the verse sheweth euidently that these wordes depend vpon the former as an exegesis or exposition thereof where paul spake not generally of all but particularly of those workes which serue directly to vphold the ministerie by sowing to the flesh therefore the apostle meaneth nothing else but to liue in the flesh to walke in it to take pleasure in it to followe the desires of it and to fulfill the lusts thereof more plainely it is wholly to giue and add ct a mans selfe to the pleasures profit honours and preferments of this life and to spend himselfe his strength and wit in compassing of them hauing little or no respect of the life to come howe he may compasse the rich purchasse of the kingdom of heauen which who so doeth shall reape nothing at the haruest but corruption that is shall haue for his reward eternall death vnderstanding by corruption the corruption of good qualities not of the substance on the contrary to sowe to the spirit is to liue in the spirit and to walke according to the spirit and to mortifie the deeds of the flesh by the spirit amp to doe those things which otherwise we would neuer doe if we were not mooued and ledde by the spirit as to bestowe a mans goods his labour and trauell his strength his wit and all in those things that may further true religion and pietie with relation to eternall life which whosoeuer doth shall reape life euerlasting as a iust recompence of his worke according to the mercifull promise of god here sundrie obiections are to be answered for the clearing of this text first the papists reason thus workes are seedes but seed are the proper cause of the fruite therefore good works are the proper cause of eternall life amp not faith only so that as there is a hidden vertue in the seede to bring forth fruit so is there a dignitie in good workes to merit eternall life ans first as in a parable so in a similitude whatsoeuer is beside the scope and drift thereof as this their dispute is prooueth nothing the scope of the similitude is this that as he which soweth wheate shall reape wheate so he that soweth to the spirit shall of the spirit reape life euerlasting and as he that soweth tares shall reape nothing but tares so he that soweth to he flesh the cursed seedes of a wicked life shall of the flesh reape nothing but corruption and as he that soweth plentifully either of these shall reape a plentifull haruest of either of them so he that sowes the seede of a godly or wicked life in plentifull manner shall reape a plentifull increase either of miserie or felicitie when the papists therefore reason thus seedes are the cause of the fruit and haue in them a hidden vertue whereby they grow and bring forth fruit therefore good works are the proper cause of life and haue a dignitie and excellency in them whereby they are worthie of eternall life they misse of the drift and intent of the apostle and so conclude nothing besides this their collection and discourse is contrarie to their own doctrine for they teach that good works are meritorious by merit of condignitie which may be vnderstood waies either in regard of the dignitie of the worke alone or in regard of the promise of god alone and his diuine acceptation or partly in regard of the dignitie and excellencie of the worke partly in regard of the promise of god now albeit some of them hold that good workes doe merit in respect onely of god promise and mercifull acceptation as scotus ariminensis durandus uega bunderius coster and the like others in respect partly of their owne worthines partly of god promise and acceptance as bonaventure biel driedo lingius iansenius bellarmine ampc it beeing the common receiued opinion among the schoolemen as b ldius witnesleth yet no e of them excepting onely caietan affi e that they are meritorious onely in regard of the dignitie of the worke which notwithstanstanding the rhemists and others labour to prooue out of this similitude vrging the analogie between seede and good workes contrarie to the current and streame of their owne doctours thirdly i answer that good workes are seedes yet faith is the roote of these seedes and in that good workes are made the seedes of eternall life it is to be ascribed to god mercifull promise not to the merit of the worke for in that we or our workes are worthie of the least blessing it is more of god mercie then our merit fourthly the apostle sheweth onely who they are that shall inherit eternall life and the order how life is attained but not the cause wherefore it is giuen it will be said not onely the order but the cause is set downe as it may appeare by the antithesis for as sowing to the flesh is the cause of destruction so sowing to the spirit is the cause of eternall life ans it is true in the one but not in the other for first sinnes or workes of the flesh are perfectly euill as beeing absolute breaches of the law and deserue infinite punishment because they offend an infinite maiestie whereas workes of the spirit are imperfectly good hauing in them wants and imperfections there beeing in euery good worke a sinne of omission comming short of that perfection that is required in the law they beeing good and perfect as they proceede from the spirit of god imperfect and vicious as they come from vs euen as water is pure as it proceedes from the fountaine but troubled as it runneth through a filthie channell or as the writing is imperfect and faultie as it comes from the yong learner but perfect and absolute as it proceedeth from the scriuener which guideth his hand so that if god setting aside mercie should trie them by the touchstone of the word they would be found to be but counterfeit and if he should waigh them in the balance of his iustice they would be found too light secondly there is a maine difference between the workes of the flesh and the works of the spirit in this very point in that the workes of the flesh are our owne workes and not the works of god in vs and so we deserue eternall death by reason of them they beeing our owne wicked workes whereas good workes proceede not from vs properly seeing we are not sufficient of our selues to thinke any good thing as of our selues corinthian but from the spirit of god who worketh in vs both the will and the deede and are his works in vs therefore beeing not ours we can merit nothing by them at the hands of god thirdly obserue that it is not said he that soweth to the spirit shall of that which he hath sownercape life euerlasting but shall of the spirit reape life euerlasting where we see the apostle attributes nothing to our workes but to the grace of god spirit lastly rom the holy ghost putteth manifest difference betweene the works of the flesh amp of the spirit in respect of merit when he saith the wages of sinne is death but eternall life is the gift of god he saith not that eternall life is the reward of good workes but the gift of god now in the reward of sinne there is merit presupposed in the gift of eternall life nothing but grace and fauour obiect ii god giueth eternall life according to the measure and proportion of the worke v as a man soweth so shall he reape corinthian he that soweth sparingly shall reape sparingly and he that soweth liberally shall reape liberally corinthian euery one shall receiue his proper wages according to his owne labour therefore in giuing eternall life he hath no respect of the promise or compact but of the dignitie and efficacie of the worke ans fulnes of glorie called by schoolemen essentiall glorie is giuen onely for the merits of christ in the riches of god mercie without all respect of workes accidentall glorie when one hath a greater measure of glorie an other a lesse as when vessels of vnequall quantitie cast into the sea are all filled yet some haue a greater measure of water some a lesse is giuen not without respect of works yet so as that it is not giuen for workes but according to workes they beeing infallible testimonies of their vnfained faith in the merits of christ if it be said that eternall life is giuen as a reward meritoriously deserued by good works because it is said come ye blessed for i was hungrie and ye gaue me meate matth i answer it is one thing to be iust an other thing to be declared and knowne to be iust we are iust by faith but we are knowne to be iust by our works therefore man shall be iudged at the last day not by their faith but by their workes for the last iudgement serueth not to make man iust that are vniust which is done by faith but to manifest them to the world what they are in deede which is done by workes man are often compared to trees in scripture now a tree is not knowne what it is by his sappe but by his fruit neither are man knowne to be iust by their faith but by their workes indeede a tree is therefore good because his sappe is good but it is knowne to be good by his fruit so a man is iust because of his faith but he is knowne to be iust by his good works therefore seeing that the last iudgement must proceede according to euidence that is vpon record for the bookes must be opened and man must be iudged of those things that are written in the bookes all must be iudged by their workes which are euident and apparent to the view of all man and not by their faith which is not exposed to the sight of any and hence it is that the scripture saith we shall be iudged according to our workes but it is no where said for our good workes gregorie saith god will giue to euery one according to his workes but it is one thing to giue according to workes an other thing for workes for works are no way the cause of reward but onely the common measure according to which god giueth a greater or less reward take this resemblance a king promiseth vnequal rewards to runners the least of which would equall the riches of a kingdome vpon condition that he which first commeth to the goale shall haue the greatest reward the second the next and so in order they hauing finished their race the king giueth them the reward according to their running who would hence but childishly inferre that therefore they merited this reward by their running and whereas they vrge that text matth come ye blessed for i was hungrie and yee fedde me i answer first that the word for doth not alway signifie a cause but any argument or reason take from any topick place as rom the righteousnes of god is made manifest vnto all and vpon all that beleeue for there is no differece for all haue sinned amp are depriued of the glorie of god where sinne is no cause of the righteousnes of faith but onely an antecedent or adiunct common to all man so when we say this is the true mother of the child for shee will not haue it diuided there for doth not implie the cause as though her refusing to haue it diuided did make her the true mother of it but onely the signe that shee was the true mother indeed secondly be it granted that it implieth the cause yet not the meritorious cause for good workes are said to be causes of eternall life not as meriting procuring or deseruing any thing at the hands of god but as they are the kings high way to eternall life god hauing prepared good works that we should walke in them if a king promise his subiect a treasure hid in the topp of a steepe and high mountaine vpon condition that he clime and digge it out his climing and digging is the efficient cause of enioying the treasure but no meritorious cause of obtaining it seeing it was freely giuen if it be further said that the word for doth here signifie the cause as well as in the words following goe ye cursed for i was hungrie and ye gaue me no meat seeing our sauiour christ speaketh after the same maner of the reward of the godly and punishment of the wicked i ans the paritie of the reason stands in this that as by good works we come to eternall life so by wicked works we runne headlong to perdition the dissimilitude is this that evil works are not onely the way but also the cause of death good workes are the way but not the cause as bernard saith they are via regni non causa regnandi obiect iii here god promiseth eternall life to good workes therefore good works merit eternall life answer there is a double couenant legall and euangelicall in the legali couenant the promise of eternall life is made vnto workes doe this and liue if thou wilt enter into life keepe the commandements but thus no man can merit because none can fulfill the lawe in the euangelicall couenant the promise is not made to the worke but to the worker and to the worker not for the merit of his work but for the merit of christ as apocrypha be faithfull vnto the end and i will giue thee the crowne of life the promise is not made to fidelitie but to the faithfull person whose fidelitie is a signe that he is in christ in whome all the promises of god are yes and amen that is most certaine and infallible secondly if any thing be due to works it is not of the merit of the worke but of god mercifull promise augustine saith god made himselfe a debter not by owing any thing but by promising thirdly no reward is due to workes of regeneration vpon compact and promise first because we are not vnder the couenant of works in which god doth couenant with vs vpon condition of our obedience but vnder the couenant of grace the tenour of which coue nant runneth vpon condition of the merits of christ apprehended by faith secondly though we were vnder the legall couenant yet we merit not because our workes are not answerable to the lawe lastly wheras the pillars of the roman church teach that the promise made vpon condition of performing the worke maketh the performer to merit is very false this is not sufficient to make a meritorious worke it is further required that the worke be answerable and correspondent in worth and value to the reward as if one shall promise a thousand crowns to him that will fetch a little water out of the next well it is debt indeed in the promiser but no merit in the performer because there is no proportion betweene the worke and the reward obiect iv sowing to the spirit is a good worke and reaping eternall life the reward but reward presupposeth memerit therefore sowing to the spirit doth merit eternall life ans there is a double reward one of fauour another of debt rom to him that worketh the wages is not counted by fauour but by debt so saith ambrose there is one reward of liberalitie and fauour another reward which is the stipend of vertue and recompence of our labour therefore reward signifieth generally any recompence or any gift that is bestowed vpon another whether it be more or lesse whether answerable to the worke or not whether vpon compact or otherwise for the scripture maketh mention of reward where there are no precedent workes as gen feare not abraham i am thine exceeding great reward that is thy full content and happinesse psalm the fruit of the wombe is a reward that is a blessing and a free gift of god in this sense i grant eternall life is a reward yet it is no proper reward but so called by a catachresis which yet is not an intollerable catachresis as bellarm either ignorantly or malitiously affirmeth but easie and familiar for in the phrase of the scripture eternall life is called a reward in a generall signification when it is vsed absolutely and not relatiuely to signifie the heele or ende of any thing and so the hebrewe word which signifieth a heele signifieth also a reward because it is giuen when the worke is ended and eternall life hath this resemblance with a reward in that it is giuen at the end of a mans life after that his trauell and warfare is ended thus the greeke words which signifie a reward and an ende are vsed indifferently one for the other pet receiuing the end of your faith the saluation of your soules that is as beza hath fitly translated it the reward of your faith for to translate it the ende of your faith cannot agree to the word receiuing for we receiue not an ende but a reward thus reward signifieth a free gift or free remuneration as when the master giueth his feruant something for his faithfull seruice though done vpon dutie when as he oweth him not thanks much lesse reward luke doth he thanke hat servant because he did that which was commanded vnto him i trowe not thus god giueth vs eternall life not because he is bound in iustice so to doe for he oweth vs neither reward nor thanks for our labour because when we haue done what we can we haue but done our dutie v but because his goodnesse and mercifull promise made thereupon doth excite him thereunto and yet eternall life is called a reward because it doth as certainly follow good works as though it were due and good workes are mentioned in the promise because they are tokens that the workers is in christ for whose merit the promise shall be accomplished and it is further called the reward or fruit of our faith as here the haruest because it is the way and meanes of obtaining it ii eternall life is called a reward of good workes not causally as procured by them but consequently as following them for abeit it be giuen properly for the merit of christ apprehended by faith yet it is giuen consequently as a recompence of our labours as an inheritance is giuen to the heire not for any duty or seruice but because he is the heire yet by consequent it is giuen in recompence of his obedience he that forsakes father amp mothershall receiue a hundred fold more in this life and in the world to come eternall life mark iii reward doth not alway presuppose debt but is often free for whereas it is said math if you loue them that loue you what reward shall ye haue it is thus in luke what thak shall ye haue by which we see that reward doth not alway signifie due debt but thankefull remembrance and gratious acceptance iv coloss eternall life is called the reward of inheritance whereby is signified that it is not giuen for our workes but because we are the sonnes of god by adoption bellarmine answers that it may be both a reward amp an inheruace a reward because it is giuen to labourers vpon compact an inheritance because it is giuen to none but those that are children but the word translated reward signifieth a gift freely giuen without respect of desert it beeing all one with as bafil teacheth vpon the psalme v the scripture teacheth that god giueth rewards foure waies first he giueth reward of due debt in respect of merit thus he giueth eternall life as a reward due not to our merits but to the merits of christ for none can merit at the hands of god but he which is god secondly he giues a reward in respect of his free and mercifull promise and thus he rewards onely beleeuers thirdly he giueth rewards to hypocrites infidel heathen ampc beeing neither bound by his owne promise nor by their merit whe they performe the outward works of the lawe and lead a ciuill life conformable thereto as when ahab humbled himselfe before the lord king and this god doth to the end he may preserue humane societie and cocommon honestie and that he may testifie what he approoueth and what he disliketh lastly he giueth good successe in interprises and attempts according to his owne decree and the order of diuine prouidence which metaphorically is called a reward ezek v because it hath a similitude thereunto as when wicked man through ignorance doe that wickedly which he hath iustly decreed shall come to passe suffering them to fill their houses with the spoyle of the poore which they haue for their work as a man hath wages for his honest labour thus the spoyle of iudea is called the hire or reward giuen to tiglath pelassat for his syrian war isay and thus the spoyle of egypt is said to be wages giuen nhebuchodonosar for his seruice against tyrus further let vs here obserue the different manner of speech which the apostle vseth in speaking of the flesh and of the spirit of the former he saith he that soweth to his flesh ampc of the latter he that soweth to the spirit not to his spirit by which is signified that what good so euer a man doth in beeing beneficiall to the ministery in furthering the gospel ampc he doth it not by any goodnes that is in himselfe but by the spirit of god who in euery good motion workes in vs the will and in euery good action the deed philip therefore no man ought to flat himselfe in this respect or to think highly of himselfe as though he had attained an extraordinary measure of sanctification either for affecting or effecting any thing that is good seeing whatsoeuer good thing is in vs is the gift of god as ierome saith on the contrary what euill soeuer a man doth he doth it of himselfe god beeing neither the author the furtherer nor the abetter thereof againe we hence learne that all vnregenerate persons are sowers to the flesh because that before their conuersion they do nothing but those things that are pleasing to the flesh so that dying in that estate they can reape nothing but corruption therefore it hence followeth that philosophers heathen and all meere ciuill and naturall man being such as neuer sowed to the spirit shall reape nothing but corruption death and condemnation contrary to the opinion of some ancient and moderne writers further obserue here that though there be some that are neuters in religion luke warme gospellers halting betweene two opinions such as are neither fish nor flesh yet in morall duties there are no neuters nor mediators for all man are ranged into one of these two ranks either they are sowers to the flesh or to the spirit here also we see who are true worldlings indeede to wit such as mind earthly things in spending themselues their stregth and witts vpon the world hauing all their care for it and all their comfort in it in the meane time hauing little or no tast of the ioyes of the world to come because they make their paradise here vpon earth and neuer looke for any heauen after this life as also who are spirituall man namely such as walke in the spirit who though they liue in the world in these houses of clay yet are not of the world because they set not their affections vpon it but haue their conuersation in heauen where christ sitteth at god right hand this serues first of all to discouer vnto vs our owne estate whether we be indeede carnall or spirituall for if we sow to the flesh that is be alway poring and digging in the earth with the mole setting our affections vpon it not referring the blessings of god to his glorie and the furtherance of the gospel but to serue our own corrupt desires we are fleshly minded though we pretend this and that and protest neuer so much and continuing in this estate we can expect nothing but the haruest of death and condemnation whereas on the contrarie side if we sauour the things of the spirit by setting our affections vpon them and seeking those things that are aboue eftsoones lifting vp our hearts by secret groanes and ejaculations for the enioying of them we are spirituall man and shall vndoubtedly in due time reape the haruest of eternall life secondly this bewraies the paucitie of spirituall man euen where the gospel is professed and how the world swarmes with multitudes of carnall and fleshly minded man for as in former times before the flood they ate they dranke they bought they sold they planted they built that is wholly addicted and deuoted themselues to these things so in these latter daies which our sauiour christ prophecied should be a counterpaine of the former the multitude generally in euery place doe wholly employ and spend themselues in thinking in affecting in talking in seeking in following of worldly things seldome god knowes or neuer minding the kingdome of god or the righteousnes thereof nor practising the apostles rule so to vse the world as though they vsed it not corinthian againe here we see how the wisdome of god is counted follie among worldly wise man and how the wisdome of the world is foolishnes before god for if a man sow to the spirit in not following blind reason nor corrupted affection nor fashioning himselfe to the guise of the world nor seeking his owne good so much as the good of others but denying himselfe forsaking all in his affection for the gospel of christ and contemning this temporal trash in regard of the heauenly treasure he is accounted in the world but a foole whereas god accounts him truly wise for he is the wise merchant man who hauing found a pearle of great price went and sold all that he had and bought it matth for the lesse he laieth vp for himselfe vpon earth the more he treasureth vp for himselfe in heauen and though he seeme to sowe vpon the water yet after many daies he shall finde it againe whereas they that minde nothing but the world in sowing to the flesh are reputed wise and prouident man when as god accounts them starke fooles thou foole this night shall they fetch away thy soule and the whose shall those things be which thou hast prouided and then it followeth so is he that gathereth riches to himselfe and is not rich in god for the more they treasure vp riches the more they treasure vp to themselues wrath against the day of wrath rom and fatte themselues against the day of slaughter iam lastly we are here warned to take heede of the deuills sophistrie it is a notable policie one of the cunningest stratagemes the deuill hath in good things commanded to seuer the meanes from the ende and in euill things forbidden to seuer the ende from the meanes he laboureth to seuer the means from the ende by perswading a man that he may come to the ende though he neuer vse the meanes that he may reape eternall life though he neuer sow the seedes of the spirit in this life but we must know that as he which runneth not at all can neuer gaine the garland he which laboureth not in the vinyard the labourers wages he that neuer sowes can neuer reape so he that runneth not in the race of christianitie shall neuer attaine the crowne of happines and felicitie he that laboureth not in the lord vineyard the recompence of reward he that in this life soweth not to the spirit shall neuer after this life reape life euerlasting for we may not dreame of a good haruest without a good seede time of sowing nothing to reape something or sowing tares to reape wheate againe he seuereth the end from the meanes by perswading man that they may vse the meanes and neuer come to the end that though they sow to the flesh yet they shall not reape corruption thus he perswaded eue that though shee did eate of the forbidden fruit yet shee should not die the death nay shee should not die at all but her eyes should be opened and she should be as god himselfe knowing good and euill but we are to be vndoubtedly resolued of this that god hath linked with an iron chain the pleasure of sinne and the punishment thereof that as he that follows a river must needes at length come to the sea so he that followes the course and streame of his sinnes must needes come at the length to the gulfe of eternall destruction let vs not therefore be wearie of well doing for in due season we shall reape if we faint not in these words the apostle expounds the fift generall rule appertaining to all sorts of man and in it he ascendeth from the hypothesis to the thesis that is from the particular to the generall shewing that we ought not to faint in any good course either in doing good to them that labour amongst vs and are ouer vs in the lord and admonish vs nor yet in beeing beneficiall vnto others and this verse dependeth vpon the former as the word therefore doth implie by way of necessarie illation and consequence for seeing that they which continue in well doing in sowing to the spirit shall of the spirit reape life euerlasting v therefore no man ought to be wearie of well doing it consisteth of two parts of a rule or precept in the former part of the verse let vs not therefore be wearie of well doing and a reason of the rule or a motiue to incite vs to the performance thereof in the latter part for in due season we shall reape if we faint not in the rule the apostle speakes that plainely which in the former verses he had deliuered more obscurely for here he expounds himselfe what he meant by sowing to the spirit namely doing of good or as it is in the next verse doeing of good vnto all which may also appeare by that which followeth we shall reape if we faint not that is we shall reape the fruit of that which we haue sowne to the spirit if we faint not therefore to sow to the spirit is nothing els but to doe good now by well doing the apostle meaneth not onely the outward worke whereby our neighbour is furthered helped relieued but the doing of it also in a good manner and to a good ende so as it may be a good worke indeede not onely profitable to our neighbours and comfortable to our selues but acceptable to god this is a most necessarie precept for most man are soone wearie of a good course like to these galatians who beganne in the spirit but beeing wearie of that walke turned aside and made an ende in the flesh gal like ephraim and iudah whose goodnes was as a morning cloud and as the morning dowe which vanisheth away hos this wearisomnes in well doing hath seased vpon the most euen vpon all drowsie professours which are the greatest part as may appeare by this in that some if they be held but a quarter of an houre too long or aboue their ordinarie time are extreamely wearie of hearing the word and as for duties of mercie and liberalitie putting vp iniuries and tolerating wrongs they are readie to make an ende as soone as they begin and as for prayer and thanksgiuing and other parts of the worship of god most man say in their hearts with the old iewes what profit is it that we keepe his commandements and that we walke humbly before the lord of hosts malach nay they count it a wearines vnto them and snuffe thereat malach hence it is that the holy ghost is so frequent in stirring vs vp to the performance of all good duties with alacritie and chearefulnes and so often in rousing vs from that drowsines and deadnes wherewith we are ouerwhelmed luke our sauiour christ propounds a parable to this ende to teach vs that we ought alwaies to pray and not to waxe faint ephesians i desire saith paul that ye faint not at my tribulations thess and ye brother be not wearie in well doing and so in this place let vs not therefore be wearie of well doing nowe the reasons which make man so wearie of wel doing are in generall these three first the strength of the flesh which euen in the regenerate is like the great gyant goliah in comparison of poore dauid secondly the weakenesse of the spirit and spirituall graces thirdly the outward occurrences and impediments of this life in speciall they be these first man by nature are wolues one to another esay v and so they continue til this woluish nature be mortified and renued by grace beeing so farre from helping furthering releeuing tollerating one another or performing any other dutie of loue that contrarily they are readie to bite and deuoure one another gal secondly oftentimes it commeth to passe that other mens coldnesse doth coole our zeale their backewardnesse slacketh our forwardnesse thirdly many thinke it a disgrace and disparagement vnto them to stoope so lowe as to become seruiceable vnto their inferiours fourthly there are many things which discourage vs from well doing either the partie is vnknowne vnto vs as dauid was to naball for which cause he would not releiue him in his necessitie or eise seemeth vnworthy of our helpe being such as through rior harlots lewd company hath brought himselfe to miserie and beggerie or such as reward vs euill for good hatred for our good will or such as are querulous alwaies complaining though neuer so well dealt withall all which make man cold in the duties of loue fiftly some there be which faine dangers and cast perils which hinder them from doing the good they should the slothfull person saith a lyon is in the way ampc lastly the manifold occasions and affaires of this life doe so distract the minde as that a man is soone wearied yes in the best things besides many see no reason why they should spend themselues in doing good vnto others now to all these obstacles and pul backs we are to oppose the apostles precept let vs not be wearie of well doing for verely if the consideration of these small occasions and rubbes that lie in our way daunt and dismay vs and so stoppe our course we shall neuer be plentifull in good workes we may happly put our hand to the plowe but a thousand to one we shall looke backe againe with lots wife cast a long looke toward sodom and with the israelites in our hearts turne againe into egypt for as he that obserueth the winde shall not sowe and as he that regardeth the cloudes shall neuer reape ecclesiastes so he that regardeth the ingratitude of some the euill example of others the manifold distractions and occurrences of this life and shall cast perils in carnall wisdome of this and that trouble or inconuenience that may ensue shall neuer doe his dutie as he ought and assuredly he that fainteth in a good course and giueth it ouer before he come to the ende is like vnto the slothfull husbandman who hauing plowed and tilled and in part sowed his ground giueth ouer before he haue finished it and so either the parching heate doth wither it or the nipping colde doth kill it or the foules of the aire deuoure it now most man are sicke of this disease which shewes the greatnes of our corruptions and that the best christians haue a huge masse or lumpe of sinne in them and but a sparke of grace in that they are seldome or neuer wearie in scraping together of riches in following their pleasures in pursuing honours and hunting after preferments and yet are quickly wearie in duties of pietie iustice and mercie albeit they haue an vnspeakable reward annexed vnto them well whatsoeuer the corrupt practises of man be let vs learne our dutie to goe forward without wearinesse nay to do good with chearefulnesse as paul saith of himselfe philip forgetting that which is behind and indeauouring himselfe to that which is before let vs consider that it is the propertie of a liberall minde to deuise of liberall things and to continue his liberality esay neither is this all not to be wearie or to persist amp continue but we must proceede on from strength to strength and bring forth more fruite in our age psalm as the church of thiaiyra whose workes were more at the last then at the first for which shee is worthely praised by our sauiour christ revelation it was the motto of charles the fift plus vltra and it ought to be euery christias motto to striue to perfectio amp as the apostle exhorts vs to be steadfast immoneable and not to make stay there but to be aboundant alwaies in the worke of the lord corinthian and that we may doe this indeed we must set this downe as a certaine conclusion that we will not recoile nor giue backe come what will come and withall we must labour to quicken our dull and drowsie spirits to girde vp the loynes of our mindes to strengthen our weake hands and our feeble knees by publike and priuate exercises of reading praier meditation conference ampc thus much of the rule nowe followeth the reason of the rule or the motiue to incourage vs to the performance of this dutie for in due season we shall reape if we faint not as if he should say more fully thus let vs be assured of this that continuing and increasing in well doing our labour is not lost nor spent in vaine corinthian for though we imagine that we labour in vaine and spend our strength in vaine as the prophet speaketh yet our worke is with the lord and our labour with our god esay and albeit we may seeme to our selues and others to cast away our goods in beeing beneficiall vnto some and as the wiseman speaketh to sowe vpon the water yet after many daies we shall finde them againe ecclesiastes in the motiue there be three things contained first the reason it selfe which is a promise of reward we shall reape secondly the circumstance of time when this haruest shall be reaped we shall reape in due season thirdly the condition that is required on our parts that we may reape if we faint not of these in order and first of the reason or promise it selfe whereas the apostle to the ende we may not be wearie of a good course doth encourage vs to proceed on by setting before our eies the promised reward i gather that we may encourage animate and excite our selues to the performance of all good duties by the consideration of the heauenly haruest which we are to reape and the crowne of glorie we are to receiue after this life as the husbandman doeth sowe in hope that he shall reape and though seed time be painefull and chargeable vnto him yet he giueth not ouer for all that but comforteth himselfe with the expectation of the haruest which will fully quite his cost and recompence his labour that this is a truth it may appeare by sundrie arguments by precept by promise by practise by reaso for precept it is the comandemet of christ we should make vs friends of vnrighteous mamon or of the riches of iniquitie that when we shall want they may receiue vs into euerlasting tabernacles luke for promise besides this place which is very pregnant to the purpose paul exhorts servant that whatsoeuer they doe they would doe it heartily as to the lord and not to man knowing that of the lord they shall receiue the reward of inheritance coloss and generally what good thing soeuer a man doth the same shall he receiue of the lord whether he be bond or free ephesians he that forsakes father and mother ampc for christs sake shall receiue a fold more in this life and in the world to come life euerlasting math these and the like promises were to no purpose if it were not lawful for vs to looke to the reward amp if we might not by considering of it incite and stirre vp our selues to greater alacritie in the course of christianitie in making vs more seruent and frequent in the duties of pietie thirdly it may be prooued by the practise of the saints of god abraham was contented to forsake his natiue country at the commaund of god and to dwell in a strange land yes and that in tents because he looked for a cittie hauing a foundation whose builder and maker is god ebr v moses esteemed the rebuke of christ greater riches then the treasures of egypt because he had respect vnto the recompence of reward v christ whose example is without all exception beeing exemplum indeficiens as the schoole man speake did sweeten the bitternes of the crosse with the consideration of the glorie which a little after he was to inioy for so the apostle saith that for the ioy that was set before him he endured the crosse amp despised the shame ebr the colossians are commended by the apostle for that they continued and increased in faith to god and loue to ma for the hopes sake that was laid vp for them in heauen coloss and paul shewes this to haue beene the practise and to be the dutie of all the saints of god so to runne that they may obtaine corinthian lastly it may be prooued by reason for first that which is the end of our actions ought to be considered of vs as a means to stirre vs vp to the attaining of this ende therefore seeing the ende of our faith and hope is eternall life rom ye haue your fruit in holinesse and the end euerlasting life pet receiuing the reward of your faith the saluation of your soules therefore we may nay we ought to cast our eies vpon it amp to direct all our actions for the attaining of it secondly if the labourer worke not in regard of the common good onely but also with respect of his wages he that runneth a race to attaine the garland if the husbandmen set and sow plant and plowe in hope to reape a haruest amp to receiue some fruite of his labours it is lawful for christians also to doe good in regard of eternall reward for that is the apostles reason corinthian they that trie masteries abstaine from all things that they may obtaine a corruptible crowne but we for an vncorruptible it is saint iames his reason iam as the husbandman waiteth for the pretious fruit of the earth and hath long patience for it vntill he receiue the former and the latter raine so must we be patient and settle our hearts for the comming of the lord draweth neare and he will recompence euery man according to his workes thirdly if it be lawful for a man to abstaine from sinne for feare of eternall punishment and torment in hell as we know it is matth then it is lawful to doe good in hope of eternall reward it will be saide that it is the propertie of a mercenarie hireling to looke for reward i answer it is the propertie of a hireling to looke onely or principally for his hire either not minding the glorie and honour of god or lesse respecting it then his owne priuate aduantage so that when the hope of his gaine is gone he leaueth his charge and flieth away like the popish monks who were right hirelings indeede for they minded nothing but their owne commoditie according to the old saying no penie no pater noster but to looke to the recompence of reward in the second place after the glorie of god the performace of our dutie and discharge of a good conscience is no propertie of a hireling seeing god hath promised to giue to them which by continuance in well doing seeke glorie and honour and immortalitie eternall life rom by this that hath beene said we may see the impudencie of the rhemists who in their marginall notes vpon luke ebr and apocrypha doe notably slander vs and our doctrine in auerring that we teach that no man ought to doe good in respect of reward the like may be said of cardinall bellarmine bintfeldius and others for this is our constant doctrine that we may and ought to stirre vp our dulnes to all chearefulnes in the discharge of our dutie by setting before our eyes the reward which is promised yet so as that we ought not onely nor principally to respect the reward for the zeale of god glorie the care and conscience we haue to discharge our dutie ought rather to mooue vs to be plentifull in good workes in lue of thankfulnes vnto god for the riches of his mercie then the greatnes of the reward seeing we ought to do our dutie though there were no heauen no hell no reward no punishment no deuill to torment no conscience to accuse the very loue of god ought to constraine vs corinthian and here we must with thankfulnes acknowledge the endles loue and mercie of god towards vs seeing that when he might exact strict obedience without any promise of recompence for our labour nay when he might shiuer vs in pieces with his iron scepter yet as abashuerosh did to queene esther he holdeth out his golden scepter vnto vs in the preaching of the word that we might lay hold of it and by it apprehend eternall life yes it pleaseth him to winne vs by gifts to incite vs by rewards to allure vs by promises in giuing his word that if we giue we may looke to receiue though not for our merits yet through his mercy if we bestowe transitorie goods we shal receiue a durable substance if a cuppe of cold water god kingdome matth the second generall point is the circumstance of time when we shall reape to wit in due time this due time may be vnderstood in part of this life for godlines hath the promise of this life as well as of the life to come and the works of mercie haue beene euen in this life recompenced to the full the widow of zanepta for entertaining the prophet eliah was miraculously sustained in the dearth the meale in her barrell did not wast and the oyle in her cruise did not diminish king and so the shunamite for the like kindnes shewed to the prophet elizeus beeing barren obtained a son and when he was dead shee obtained him to life againe king as the widow of sarepta did hers at the praier of eliah king foras god doth alwaies giue to his children in this life the first of his spirit so he doth often giue them the first fruits of their labours as a tast of their future felicitie and an earnest of that happines which after they shall fully enioy our sauiour christ saith he will reward them an hundred fold in this life matth but this due time is properly meant of the life to come which hath two degrees the first is at the day of death when the soule entreth into happines the second at the day of iudgement when both soule and bodie beeing reunited shall be put in full possession of eternall glorie and felicitie for then they shall be rewarded according to their workes not so much as a cuppe of cold water which they haue giuen to releeue the saints of god but shall be recompenced to the full matth use seeing god hath set downe a set and certen time when we are to reape it is our dutie with patience to expect it as the husbandman doth who hauing sowed his field doth not looke for a croppe the next day or weeke or moneth but patiently expecteth the haruest that he may receiue the pretious seede of the earth for he is too vnreasonable who hauing sowed in september looketh for a croppe in october he must waite for the moneth of august till the haruest and in the meane time indurestorme and tempest winde and weather snow and raine haile and frost so we must sow our seede and sow plentifully still expecting the fruite of our labour with patience till the great haruest come the great day of retribution in which god will seperate the wheat from the chaffe gathering the one into his garners and burning vp the other with vnquenchable fire matth let vs consider the example of god who doth patiently expect and as i may say waites our leisure when we will turne vnto him that he might haue mercie vpon vs isaiah he waiteth at the doore of our hearts and standeth knocking to be let in apocrypha nay he calleth vnto vs standing without open vnto me my sister my loue my doue my vndefiled for my head is ful of dew and my lockes with the droppes of the night cant wee vnto thee ierusalem will thou neuer be made cleane when will it once be ier more particularly god wayting and expecting is set downe in scripture by sundrie degrees first he waiteth all the day long isaiah i haue stretched out my hand all the day long to a disobedient and gainsaying people secondly fourtie daies together yet fourtie daies and niniue shall be destroied ion thirdly all the yeare long as the husbandman doth i looked for grapes and loe wild grapes isaiah fourthly he expecteth our amendement many yeares together luke behold these three yeares haue i come and sought fruit on this figtree and find none fifthly the lord suffered the manners of the israelites fourtie yeares in the wildernes psalm act sixtly the long sufferance of god as peter saith epistle did patiently expect the conuersion of the old world all the while the arke was in preparing for the space of an hundred and twentie yeares seuenthly he expected the canaanits and amorits for the space of foure hundred yeares yes he suffered all gentiles to wander in their owne waies and in the vanitie of their minde almost for three thousand yeares together act now if god be so patient in expecting our amendement from day to day from yeare to yeare we ought to be patient in expecting the accomplishment of his promises day after day and yeare after yeare as we are commanded habac though the vision tarie yet wait for it for it shall surely come and shall not stay and though it be long before we reape any fruit of our labours yet let vs with patience expect it for in due season we shall reape if we faint not for if god wait vpon vs not for his owne good but for ours what a shame is it that we will not waite vpon him in tarrying his good leisure for our owne good the dumme and s nsles creatures may set vs to schoole in this point for they expect with a feruent desire to be deliuered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious libertie of the sonnes of god rom and as the word signifieth they expect with a longing desire euen with thrusting forth their heads as the poore prisoner that is condemned doth who eftsoones putteth forth his head out of the window in a continuall earnest expectation of the gratious pardon of the prince it is our parts therefore to waite as dauid did who saith of himselfe psalm i am wearie of my crying my eyes faile me whilst i waite for my god for if we giue ouer our patient expecting and faint in our minds seeking to anticipate this dve time this period which god hath prefixed in his vnchangeable will more immutable then the lawes of the medes and persians a thousand to one but we runne for helpe either to the witch of endor as saul did sam or to the wizzard of pethor as balack did numb or to the sorcerer and figure flinger of babel as nebuchadnetzer did ezek or if all these faile as commonly they doe we either breake out into open blasphemie as the king of israel did king behold this euill commeth of the lord should i attend on the lord any longer or in the depth of discontent we play the desperate part of razez and lay violent hands vpon our selues macchab the third thing to be considered is the condition required on our part that we may reape in due time set downe in these words if we faint not the wordes in the originall are thus we shall reape in due time not fainting which may be and are of some taken in a double sense either as a promise or as a condition as a promise thus if we be not wearie of well doing we shall reape in due season without all fainting and wearines either to the bodie or minde that is we shall reape with all ioy and comfort as it is psalm they that sow in teares shall reape in ioy and they that went weeping and caried pretious seede shall come againe with ioy and bring their sheaues with them as a condition that if we continue constant in well doing to the end without fainting we shall reape in the time that god hath appointed and in this sense it is to be taken in this text to wit conditionally as it is well translated if we faint not we are further to consider that there is a double fainting one of the bodie another of the minde the bodily fainting which commeth by labour and toyling is not here meant seeit doeth nothing impeach the goodnesse of the worke it is an argument rather of the soundnesse and sinceritie thereof but the spirituall fainting is that which is to be seared because it maketh our labour all in vaine and this spirituall fainting is two fold the first is the slaking and remitting some what of our course and this hath and doeth befall the saints of god as we may see in the example of the church of ephesus which left her first loue apocrypha yes all the saints of god haue their turbida intervalla troubled and distempered fits sometime in the full sometime in the wane sometime zealous and forward in the seruice of god sometime againe heauie and backeward ampc the second is such a fainting amp languishing that we cleane giue ouer our course of which paul speakes corinthian therfore we faint not but though our outward man perish yet the inward man is renewed daily and the author to the hebrewes we must consider christ who endured such speaking against of sinners least we should be wearied and faint in our soules heb and againe ver despise not the chastening of the lord neither faint whe thou article rebuked of him this fainting is meant in this place whereas saint paul saith we shall reape if we faint not he signifieth that we must perseuere and continue to the ende otherwise we cannot looke to reape the haruest of eternall happinesse it is nothing but constancy and continuing in well doing that doeth crowne all our good works be constant saith our sauiour christ to the church of smyrna apo and i will giue thee the crowne of life ierome saith it is the propertie of true vertue not to beginne well but to ende well paul blameth these galatians for beginning in the spirit and ending in the flesh and christ shewes what a shame it is to him that beginneth to build and cannot finish it it is as good neuer a whit as neuer the better nay his condition is better that never began then that of iudas whose end was worse then his beginning leuit the taile of the sacrifice was commanded to be offered vpon the altar by which was signified that in euery good worke we must not onely begin but continue in it to the end and sacrifice the ende of it to god as well as the beginning otherwise we loose our labour and misse our reward therefore saint john biddeth vs looke to our selues that we loose not the things which we haue done but that we may receiue a full reward ioh v the labourers in the vineyard came at sundry times some in the morning others at the third others at the sixt and ninth others at the twelfth houre of the day yet none receiued the labourers wages but those that continued in the worke to the ende matth god is alpha and omega and therfore requireth a good ende as well as a good beginning and it is our dutie not onely to obey the commandement of christ venite ad me come vnto me matth but that also manete in me abide in me ioh for he onely that continueth to the ende shall be saued matth further whereas the apostle saith we shall reape if we faint not it may be demanded whether the saints doe so faint at any time that they finally fall away to which demaund i answer in a word that they doe not nay they cannot totally and finally fall from grace for first if any thing should make them fall away it is sinne but they cannot sinne because the seede of regeneration and grace remaineth in them ioh and though the church sleepe yet her heart waketh cant and if any thing make them faint it is affliction and persecution but these and all other crosses worke together for the best vnto them that loue god rom and therefore these are no hinderances but furtherances rather to their saluation secondly they are built and founded vpon the promise of god i will put my spirit into their hearts so that they shall not depart from me ierem therefore christ doth so preserue them by his power preuent them by his grace guard and guide them by his spirit that they shall neuer fall away and that none shall plucke them out of his hand ioh i adde further that they are built vpon the trueth and fidelitie of his promise god is faithfull and wil not suffer you to be tempted aboue that you be able but will giue the issue with the temptation that ye may be able to beare it corinthian thirdly vpon the praier of christ who praied that they might be kept from euill ioh that they might be one in the trinitie as he in the father and the father in him v that they may be with him and see his glorie v now christ was alway heard in that which he praied for ioh lastly vpon the life of christ which is communicated to all his liuing members gal v when christ which is their life shall appeare then shall they also appeare with him in glorie coloss quest if they cannot altogether faint and fall away why doth the holy ghost make a doubt of it as though they might ans it is the will of god to mooue vs to perseuerance and to stirre vp our dulnesse by such speeches that we should not be wanting to our our selues in the vse of the meanes while we haue therefore time let vs doe good vnto all man but specially to them which are of the houshold of faith in these words the apostle doeth iterate the conclusion propounded in the sixt verse as also in the ninth verse immediately going before that we should doe the good we can while we haue time and withall he doeth illustrate it both by the obiect to whome we must doe good and by the circumstance of time howe long we must continue therein and herein he answereth a secret demande which might be made vpon the former rule for whereas it might be thought that the gentiles which professe not the same religion with vs were to be neglected or at least not so respected as we reade act v the gretians were neglected of the ebrewes in their daily ministerie the apostle answereth that we must not restraine our boutie and goodnesse onely to those that are of the same religion with vs but enlarge it vnto all we must doe good vnto all man but specially to them of the houshold of faith in the words we may consider three things first the dutie it selfe let vs doe good secondly the obiect or persons to whome we must doe good which is laid downe comparatiu ly we must doe good to all but specially to those that are of the houshold of faith thirdly the circumstance of time when and how long we are to doe good whilest we haue time of these in order and first of the dutie this generall dutie of doing good is recommended vnto vs by sundrie arguments the first may be taken from the maine ende and scope of a mans life in this world which as paul signifieth in this place is nothing else but to doe good and this doing of good standeth in three things the first concerneth god in praysing magnifying and adoring his holy name dauid had an eie to this ende when he desired to liue for no other ende but that he might praise god o let my soule liue and it shall praise thee the second concerneth our selues in seeking the kingdome of god and the righteousnesse thereof by making our calling and election sure by good pet this ende of a mans life salomon intimateth when he saith let vs heare the end of all feare god and keepe his commandements for this is the whole dutie of man ecclesiastes v the third concerneth our brother in doing good vnto them so farre forth as possibly we can in the compasse of our calling for it is the ende of euery mans calling in seruing of man to serue god and this is that which paul vrgeth in this place to be beneficiall vnto all the second may be taken from the example of god himselfe we must doe good to them that hate vs that we may be the children of our heauenly father matth v for we are more conformeble vnto god in doing good vnto others it beeing an essentiall propertie in god to doe good to euery man seeing that euery creature doth drinke or at least taste of the sweet cuppe of god goodnesse psalm v then in receiuing good from them for he receiueth nothing from vs as dauid saith my goodnesse reacheth not to thee psalm v to the exaple of god we may add the exaple of godly kings the cheifest praise and commendation of hezekiah and iosiah is noted by their goodnesse concerning the rest of the acts of hezekiah and his goodnesse they are written chronicle concerning the rest of the acts of iosiah amp his goodnesse doing as it was written in the lawe of the lord beholde they are written chronicle and this excellent name of goodnesse or bountifulnesse was as it may seeme by the lawe of nation ascribed to princes and potentates in that it best beseemed them as in name so in the vertue it selfe to expresse the diuine nature of god by and therefore they were called that is bountifull benefactors or gratious lord luke the third is drawne from testimonie diuine and humane our sauiour christ saith it is a blessed thing to giue rather then to receiue act that is to doe good rather then to receiue good orat d pauperum amore nazianzen saith that a man doth resemble good in no propertie so much as in doing good and the heathen orator demosthenes could say that bonum prophylacticum vel conservativum congregativum communicativum doing of good and speaking the truth makes vs most like to god himselfe but to consider this more particularly goodnes is threefold preseruing vniting communicating in all which particulars we are to practise this dutie and first for the preseruing goodnes we must doe good not onely to our selues but to others also in labouring to keepe and preserue them from the contagion of finne from falling from grace or backsliding from their holy profession by all good meanes as by good example and by gratious speeches seasoned with salt ampc as barnabas did who comming to antioch and seeing the grace of god that was giuen them was glad and confirmed them therein exhorting them that with purpose of heart they would cleaue vnto the lord act and for this cause as i take it it is added v that he was a good man and full of the holy ghost and faith the vniting goodnes is likewise to be practised in setting man at vnitie in reconciling those that are at variance in making peace and amitie where there is nothing but enmitie and dissention for for this cause christ calleth peace makers the children of god matth because herein they liuely resemble the goodnes of god their heauely father as any son doth resemble any qualitie or propertie in his naturall father for he maketh man to be of one minde in one house psalm the communicating goodnes beeing especially vnderstood in this place hath foure degrees first for temporall things we must communicate to the necessities of the saints rom and for spiritual blessings we must remeber the saying of peter let euery man as he hath receiued a gift so minister the same vnto others as good disposers of the manifold grace of god pet secondly we must be plentifull in the workes of mercie not contenting our selues with this that we are beneficiall to some in releeuing them in their wants and necessities but we must be rich in good workes tim charge them that are rich in this world that they be not high minded that they doe good and be rich in good works readie to distribute and to communicate we must be like tabitha or dorcas who cloathed the poore with the garments which shee made at her owne proper cost and charges act and for this cause the holy ghost giueth this testimonie of her that shee was rich or full of good works amp almes which shee did v like to the vertuous woman prou who openeth the palme of her hands to the poore and stretched out her hands to the needie like iob of whome it is said that the loynes of the poore blessed him iob thirdly we must be much in goodnes as the scripture speaketh of god that is abundant in goodnes in communicating vnto others abundantly those blessings which the lord hath stored vs withall not onely in louing our brother for which the thessalonians are commended that their loue one towardes another did abound but in a liberall supplying of their wants as paul exhorts the corinthians that as they did abound in faith and loue so they would abound in rich liberalitie corinthian as good obadiah did in spending his liuing and venturing his life in hiding an hundred of the lord prophets from the furious rage of wicked iesabel king lastly we must be exceeding or superabundant in goodnes in exceeding measure if it may be in doing good like the poore widow who had rather want her selfe then be altogether wanting in contribution to the treasurie of the lord temple and therefore though it was but two mites which shee cast into the corban yet christ preferred it before all the rich mens offerings beeing put together in that they gaue of their superfluitie but shee of her penurie cast in all that shee had euen all her liuing luke it is well said by s ambrose we must releeue the wants of others according as we are able and sometime euen aboue our abilitie as paul witnesseth of the corinthians to their great commendation that to their power amp beyond their power they were willing corinthian further in doing good we must obserue these rules i we must doe good of that onely which is our owne for we may not cut a large and liberall shine of another mans loafe as the common saying is we may not steale from one to giue to another or deale vniustly with some that we may be mercifull to others or robbe peter to cloath paul the lord abhorreth euen burnt offer if it be of that which is gotten by rapine and holocaustum de rapina spoile isaiah and hence it is that dauid would not offer burnt offer without cost of that which was not his owne chronicle ii we must doe good with chearefulnes and alacritie for god loueth a chearefull giuer corinthian ambrose saith fitly and finely to this purpose well doing ought to proceede from wellwilling for such as thine affection is such is thy action therefore if we giue we must doe it freely otherwise it is no gift for what more free then gift therefore we may not play the hucksters in doing good for that doth most blemish the excellencie of the gift for as lactantius saith danda beneficia non foeneranda iii we must so doe good as that we doe not disable our selues for euer doing good but may continue in well doing and as the psalmist speaketh bring forth more fruit in our age salomon commands that the streames of our wells should flow to others yet so as that the fountaine be still our owne psalm a good man is mercifull and lendeth and will guide his affaires with iudgement that is he will so discreetly dispose and order all his actions as that he will keepe himselfe within his compasse so beginning to doe good as that he may continue therefore the wise man saith in the house of the wise there is a pretious treasure and oyntment but a foolish man deuoureth it prou all the disciples that were at antioch sent succour to the brother which were in iudea in the great famine that was in the time of claudius cesar yet euery man according to his abilitie act for according to pauls rule we must not so giue that others be eased and we our selues pinched corinthian iiii we must doe all the good we can possibly within the compasse of our callings and hinder all the euill it will be said god whose example we are to follow doth not all the good he can neither doth he hinder all the euill therefore we are not bound to doe all the good or preuent all the euill we can i answer in this particular we are not to imitate the example of god and that for three causes first because we are subiect to the law thou shalt not doe euill that good may come of it rom whereas god is not bound nor subiect to any law no not to his owne law but is aboue it and hath power to dispence with it secondly because he is able to draw good out of euill light out of darknes which we cannot doe thirdly because god is the generall good we particular now there is great difference between these two for it belongs to the nature of the particular good to procure all the good that may be simply to euery one amp to hinder all euill whereas to the nature of the generall or vniuersall good things appertaine first that all things should be good in some measure of goodnes secodly that some things should be better then others thirdly that those things that are defectiue in goodnes that is euills should be ordayned to the common good as in a well ordered house all the parts thereof are good in their kind secondly some better then others as paul saith in a great house there are vessells of gold and siluer of wood and stone some for honour and some for dishonour tim thirdly those that are destitute of goodnes as sinkes draughts and other like places seruing for base though necessarie vses are ordained to the common good of the whole house which it cannot want and therefore if the master builder to preuent these particular euills should leaue them out of his building he should preiudice the common good of the whole house which cannot be without them thus much of the first part namely the duty now i proceede to prosecute the second which shews first to whome we must do good and secondly the order to be obserued therein we must do good vnto all but specially to those which are of the houshould of faith touching the first it may seeme that some among the galatians were of the pharises mind who thought they were bound to loue their friends but not their enemy or of this perswasion that they were not bound in coscience to do good vnto the healthen amongst whom they liued as being professed enemy of christ amp ope persecutors of his church but paul teacheth the amp vs another lesson whe he comands vs to do good vnto all sutable to that of our sauiour christ loue your enemy blesse them that curse you doe good to them that hate you pray for them that hurt you and persecute you matth let vs consider the good samaritans practise albeit there was mortall hatred between the iewes and the samaritans ioh yet he seeing his deadly enemie wounded and halfe dead had compassion vpon him powred wine and oyle into his soares bound vp his woundes set him on his owne beast brought him to an inne and made prouision for him the like ought we to doe euen to our enemy as occasion shall serue luke for if we must doe good to our enemy beast his oxe or asse going astray in bringing him home againe exod much more ought we to doe good to our enemie himselfe for the more beneficiall and communicatiue we shewe our selues to be the greater goodnesse we shewe to be in vs as the fountaine which powreth forth his streames vnto all and the candle which standeth vpon a candlestieke shineth vnto all and not to it selfe being couered with a bushell the reasons why we ought to doe good vnto all euen to our enemy are principally foure the first may be taken from the grounds of loue and beneficence which are in all man euen in the wicked themselues nowe the grounds of loue are specially three the first is the image of god which beeing in all man yes euen in prophane persons in part ought to be the loadstone of loue to draw our affection vnto it the second is communion and fellowship in the same nature and therefore we ought to be beneficiall vnto man because they are man amp though we will not doe good homini yet we must doe it humanita i as the philosopher said the third is participation in the death of christ in that all man haue part in christ as well as we for any thing we knowe secondly god whose example we are to followe as hath beene said is good and bountifull vnto all causing his sun to shine as well vpon the badde as the good and his aine to fall as well vpon the ground of the vniust as of the iust beeing kinde vnto the vnkind and to the wicked thirdly we must doe to others as we would they should doe to vs therefore if we beeing in distresse would be glad to receiue good at the hand of a wicked man we ought in the like case to doe good vnto him fourthly our profession and the reward which we looke for require this at our hands for if we doe good vnto them onely that doe good vnto vs or if we be friendly to those onely that are friendly to vs what singular thing doe we for euen the publicans doe the like and so hauing our reward here in this life we can expect none other after this life matth the second point which containeth the order to be obserued in doing good is laid downe in these words let vs doe good to all but specially to those which are of the houshould of faith by them of the houshold of faith we are to vnderstand those which by faith are of the same familie with vs namely of the same catholike church vpon earth the house of god beeing often put to signifie the church of god as tim the house of god is called the church of god the ground and pillar of trueth ebr moses was faithfull in all god house that is his church and thus this phrase is expounded ephesians ye are no more strangers and forrainers but citizens with the saints and of the houshold of god so that by them of the houshold of faith we must vnderstand onely the faithfull indeed among man not onely children but also man servant and maide servant are counted to be of the family but god accounts them onely to be of his house that are saints by calling and sonnes by faith the rest are bastards and not sonnes they are it may be in the house but not of the house for true sauing faith doth characterize those that are of the familie of faith euen as fanaticall dreames fantasticall opinions allegorizing of the literall sense of the scripture denying the resurrection of the flesh doe characterize those that are of the familie of loue hauing the meaning cosider the dutie which is to do good principally to the faithfull the saints amp servant of god that is we must do good vnto the before others amp more the to others which are not of the same familie as dauid saith my well doing reacheth not to thee but to the saints that are in the earth amp them that excel in vertue psalm for it is alone as if the apostle should haue said as it is fit and conuenient that they that are of the same familie should be helpefull and beneficiall one vnto another rather then to those that are of another family so it is requisite that those which are members of the same bodie nay sonnes and daughters brother and sisters hauing the same god for their father the same church for their mother christ for their elder brother begotten of the same immortall seede nourished with the same milke of the word and looking for the same blessed inheritance should rather be beneficiall one to another then to those that are forrainers and strangers no way linked vnto them by the bond of faith now the reasons why we ought especially to doe good to them of the houshold of faith may be these first because god loueth all his creatures specially mankind most especially the faithfull vpon whome he doeth bestowe the riches of his loue yes himselfe also for though god be good vnto all psalm yet in a speciall sort he is good to israel to them that are of a pure heart psalm he is a sauiour of all man specially of those that beleeue tim secondly because whatsoeuer is done to one of god saints is done vnto him matth thirdly in respect of the excellencie of their persons in that they are sonnes of god heires of his kingdome members of christ temples of the holy ghost ampc further in that all the faithfull are called a houshold and a family this teacheth vs that as we haue one bedde and one board one bread to seede vpon and one cuppe whereof all drinke so we should haue one minde and one heart we should cleaue together and hold together for if they of the family of loue ioyne together why should not we which are of the familie of faith hold together if those of the kingdome of darkenesse combine themselues together as it is psalm the kings of the earth band themselues and the princes are assembled together a gainst the lord and against his christ act doubt lesse against thine holy son iesus whome thou hast annointed both herod and pontius pilate with the gentiles and people of israel gathered theselues together psalm they haue consulted together in heart and haue made a league against thee the tabernacles of edom and the ishmaelites moab and the agarims gaball and ammon and amalec the philistims with the inhabitant of tyrus ashur also is ioyned with them they haue beene anarme to the childre of lot how much more therefore ought the children of light to company and consort together but the children of this world are wiser in their generation then the children of light nay the bruite beast may condemne vs in this point for cattel heard together sheep flocke together fish shole together and as the prouerbe is birdes of a feather will flie together what a shame is it therefore for vs that are of the same family of faith to fall out making a rent in the coate and a diuision in the bodie of christ by seperating our selues one from another in affection of heart and practise of life againe this may minister comfort to all the faithfull beeing vnder the crosse to consider that they are of god family and therefore neede not doubt of the prouidence of god but that he will prouide things necessarie for them for he that prouideth not for his owne and specially for them of his familie hath denied the faith and is worse then an infidell lastly in that the faithfull are called a familie it shewes that they are but fewe euen a handefull in comparison of the world for what is a familie to a country or a kingdome indeed i graunt if those of the family of faith be considered by themselues they are many matth i say vnto you that many shall come from the east and from the west and shall sit downe with abraha isaac and iacob in the kingdome of heauen nay they are innumerable apocrypha after these things i beheld and loe a great multitude which no man could number of all nation amp kindreds and people and tongues stood before the throne and before the lambe cloathed with long white robes and palmes in their hands but beeing compared with infidel which shall be condemned they are but fewe matth enter in at the straite gate for it is the wide gate and broad way that leadeth to destruction and manie there be which goe in thereat because the gate is straite and the way narrow that leadeth vnto life and fewe there be that find it many are called but few chosen here they are called a family amp a little flock luke amp a remnant rom let the papists therfore brag of their vniuersalitie and multitude as much as they list in the meane time let not vs feare to ioyne our selues to the litle flocke of christ and with them to goe on in the straite way to eternall life the order which we are to obserue in doing good to others is else where more distinctly set downe in scripture amp it stands in these degrees first and principally a man must do good to those of his familie as to wife children servant tim if there be any that prouideth not for his owne and especially for them of his houshold he hath denied the faith and is worse then an infidell secondly after those of our familie we must doe good to our parents and progenitors tim if any widow haue children or nephewes let them that is those children or nephewes learne first to shew godlines toward their owne house and to recompence their parents marke they must first do good to their owne house and then in the second place to their parents that is their fathers amp mothers if they be children their grandfathers and grandmothers if they be nephewes thirdly after the two former we must doe good to our kinred tim if any prouide not for his ownehe hath denied the faith ampc where by owne we are chiefely to vnderstand those poore widowes that are neare of blood or kinred vnto vs or generally all those that are of our kinred in the flesh who are therefore called ours because they doe more nearely concerne vs as being linked vnto vs by the bond of nature they that are of our kinred are to be respected and releeued of vs in the third place if they be of the houshold of faith otherwise the saints of god which are neither kith nor kinne vnto vs are to be preferred before them fourthly of strangers and forreners we are to doe good to the faithfull before others fiftly and lastly we must be beneficiall to all whether friends or foes of our kinred or strangers of the house of god or otherwise as god in his prouidence shall offer them vnto vs for so paul saith we must doe good vnto all man it will be said we are to loue all man alike seeing we must loue our neighbours as our selues and therefore we must doe good to all man alike not respecting the faithfull more then others i answer our loue of our brother is lesse or greater either in respect of the obiect in wishing a greater or a lesse good vnto them and thus we must loue all man alike in wishing to them eternall life or in respect of the intention of our loue in hauing a greater desire of the good of some then of othersome and thus we are not bound to loue or to doe good to all alike for as s barnard saith meliori major affectus indigentiori major effectus tribuendus this doctrine inuested with the former examples may shame the base seruile and beggerly liberalitie of the common sort of man which professe the gospel whose hands are tied to their purses and their hearts locked to their chests who are so extremely miserable that they neither doe good to others nor yet to themselues secondly it condemneth them which are so vnnaturall that they forget all dutie to their kinred and acquaintance in the flesh thirdly those who will doe good to none but to those that haue done good to them this is right the pharisies righteousnes to loue our friends and hate our enemy the goodnes of the publican to lend to those of whom they look for the like lastly those who are so full of the poison of malice and reuenge that beeing once incensed they can neuer be appeased till they crie quittance with those that offend them the third thing to be considered in the words is the circumstance of time we must doe good to all while we haue time here sundrie points are to be obserued i if we must doe good while we haue time we must make a holy and profitable vse of our time the rarest iewell and greatest of all earthly treasures because time will not alway last and therefore we must take time while it is time seeing time and tide will tarie for no man let vs consider what a shame it is that the children of this world should be wiser in their generation then we who professe our selues to be children of light the mariner or sea faring man who obserues wind and weather taketh the oportunitie of the time the trauailer or way faring man takes day before him and trauaileth while it is light the smith striketh the iron while it is hot for when it is cold it is too late to strike the lawyer taketh his time to wit the terme time for the intertaining of his clients and following of his suits for when the terme is ended his time is gone now it is alway terme time with christians euery present day euen this present time is their terme time therefore if we will not shew our selues more carelesse amp negligent nay more absurdly foolish or desperatly madde then all man we must take the opportunitie that is offered to do good and vse the pretious time which god in mercie affordeth vs to his glorie our comfort and the good of others time and opportunitie of doing good is hieroglyphically resembled by the head of a man that hath locks of haire before which a man may take hold of but hath none behind whereby is signified that when opportunitie is past there is no possibilitie left to doe good we must not therefore let slippe any good occasion but take hold of it at the first when it is offered hence it is that the apostle eb biddeth vs exhort one another daily while it is called to day and the wise man prou say not to thy neighbour goe and come againe and to morrow will i giue thee if thou now haue it for he may die and so cannot come againe or by thy delaying of him may be discouraged from comming or thou maist be hardened against him or maist with the rich man in the gospel be suddenly taken away from thy riches or thy riches taken from thee our sauiour biddeth vs walke in the light while we haue light ioh ii if we must doe good while we haue time we must obserue the apostles golden rule ephesians redeeme the time which is nothing els but so to employ it and vse the benefit of it as that we suffer it not to slippe away from vs without fruit or profit either for sloth and idlenes or by reason of vaine and transitorie pleasures or other occasions of this life but to gaine that time we formerly lost by negligence with double diligence yes to redeeme it with the losse of our ease our pleasures our profit and we shall the better practise this dutie if we consider that time is short pretious irrevocable it is short and therefore to be guided by diligence it is pretious and therfore to be redeemed by an high estimate and account of it in not beeing too lauish of it in bestowing it vpon our friends not vpon our enemy in placing it as a iewell in our golden age and wearing it in our newe garments the robes of christ his righteousnes and not as a pearle in a swines snowt in the rotten ragges of sinne and wickednes lastly it is irreuocable and therefore it is to be redeemed by taking the opportunitie thereof iii paul commaunding vs to doe good while we haue time would haue vs know times and seasons to obserue the shortnes of time to number our daies that we may applie our hearts to wisdome the not knowing and obseruing of time is a sinne much inueighed against by our sauiour christ matth o hypocrites you can discerne the face of the skie and can ye not discerne the signes of the times luke why discerne ye not this time the lord doth preferre the very bruit beast before his people because they know their appointed times and seasons whereas his people knew not the time of mercie and grace which was offered vnto them euen the storke in the ayre knoweth her appointed times the turtle and the crane and the swallow obserue the time of their comming but my people knoweth not the iudgement of the lord ier and christ threatneth ierusalem that one stone should not be left vpon another because they knew not the time of their visitation luke and verily of all follies and ignorances this is the greatest not to know the day of our visitation the acceptable time the day of saluation when god offereth mercie by rising earely and calling vs by the ministerie of his word and stretching out his hands all the day long rom v for if he stand at the doore of our hearts and knocke by the sound of his word outwardly by the motion of his spirit inwardly by his threatnings by his promises by his iudgements by his mercies by his tolerance and long suffering and yet for all that we will not open nor listen vnto him we shall stand with the fiue foolish virgin and knock at his mercie gate and say lord lord open vnto vs when it will be too late when heauen shall be shut against vs matth for for this cause among others they are called foolish virgin because they considered not the time of the bridegroomes comming here it will be saide obseruing of time is forbidden gal ye obserue daies and times and moneths and years i am afraid of you least i haue spent on you labour in vaine ans there is a twofold obseruing of time good and euill lawful and unlawful vnlawfull and superstitious is either iewish or heathenish the iewish and superstitious obseruation of times is when religion is placed in the keeping of them in an opinion that they bind the conscience to the strict obseruing of them as their iubilies feasts of the passeouer of weekes of tabernacles calends new moones ampc heathenish when times are obserued in respect of good or badde successe as when man make two egyptian daies vnluckie daies in euery moneth in regard of health when they count leape yeare ominous as valentinian did who beeing newly created emperour would not come forth and shew himselfe the bissext of februarie not manse malu maio cubere vulgus ait to marrie in the moneth of may to obserue planetarie houres and climactericall yeares the horoscope or time of a mans birth and the position of the heauens at that time both these kinds are forbidden paul was afraid of the galatias first because they obserued daies and moneths amp yeares that is iewish ceremonies amp beggerly rudimets secondly because they obserued times or seasons that is heathenish superstitions mentioned before and assuredly besides the vnlawfulnes of this practise it is also vaine euen in the iudgement of the heathen theselues alexander the great commanded the macedonian souldiers which had not beene accustomed to fight in iune because it had beene ominous vnto them that they should call it iuly and so got the victorie ouer darius lucullus beeing to fight with tigranes vpon an vnlucky day in which cepio was ouercome of the cimbrians i will said he make it fortunate to the romanes and got the victorie and who knoweth not that the selfe same day hath beene fortunate or luckie to some as they vse to speake vnfortunate and vnluckie to others the same day was crassus slaine by the parthians and pachor king of parthia taken by ventidius the same day was vnto pompey the day of his birth and the day of his death the same day was to fredericke the second his coronation day and his funerall day the lawful obseruing of time is two fold humane diuine humane is threefold naturall ciuill ecclesiasticall naturall is the obseruing of the motion of the sun the moone and the starres whose reuolutions make times and seasons daies moneths yeares the obseruing of the foure quarters or seasons of the yeare spring summer autumme winter the ecclipses of sun and moone the full moone the wane the change the time of cutting of timber of plant sowing ampc in obseruing whereof a great part of astronomy philosophie and husbandrie is imployed ciuill is when times are obserued in regard of pollicie or of the good of the common wealth as faire times market times tearme times ampc the spring as fit time for kings to goe forth to war sam the keeping of lent fasting daies ember weekes are all in a ciuill respect for the breed of cattell the maintenance of nauigation and the plentie of all things ecclesiasticall when set times are obserued in the church for order sake without superstition or opinion of worship as among the iewes the feast of purim esth the feast of the dedication ioh amongst christians festiuall daies as the feast of the natiuitie of circumcision of the resurrection amp ascension of christ these and such like solemnities appointed for our thankesgiuing and humiliation are not unlawful if they be enioyned by lawful authoritie and kept in good manner diuine is when vpon the consideration of the shortnesse and vncertainetie of our liues we prepare our selues against god shall call vs and so number our daies that we apply our hearts to wisedome psalm or obseruing the day of god mercifull visitation we take the opportunitie and vse the meanes that is offered for our conuersion and saluation or obseruing the time of god visitation in iudgement and indignation we hide our selues vnder the couert of his wings prou iv hence we learne that there is no possibilitie of doing good or beeing beneficiall vnto others after this life for paul biddeth vs doe good while we haue time thereby insinuating that after death all possibilitie of doing good is cleane cut off the time allotted to doe good beeing included within the limits of this life the dead that die in the lord rest from their labours revelation therefore no good workes are performed after this life paul beeing aged and readie to die the tearme of his life beeing almost expired saith i haue finished my course tim which could not be truely said if he were to performe any good workes after his death corinthian we must giue account for all things we haue done in the body that is in this life where it is to be obserued that the apostle speaking of all the workes whereof we are to giue account doth confine them within the compasse of this life therefore no workes can be done after this life be ended let vs heare the testimonie of the auntient cyprian to demetr quando istine excessum est nullus locus poenitentia est nullus satisfactionis effectus ierome dum in praesenti saculo sumus siue orationibus sine concilijs invicem posse nos coadinvari cm autem ante christi tribunal venerimus non iob non daniel nec noe rogare posse pro quoquam sed vnumquemque portare onus suum and againe in hac vita licet nobis quod volumus seminare quum transierit operandi tempus auferetur ampc hence i gather two things first that the doctrine of purgatorie is a meere fable because there is no time after this life be ended left to doe good either to our selues or others and therefore not to worke righteousnesse to repent or to satisfie the iustice of god which the popish sort say is done in purgatorie but what should i stand to batter the paper walles of purgatory with the canon of the scripture which were long agoe burnt to ashes by the fire of the word secondly seeing all opportunitie nay all possibility of doing good is confined in the compasse of this life euery man must followe the counsell of the wiseman salomon all that thy hand shall finde to doe doe it with all thy power for there is neither worke nor inuention nor knowledge nor wisedome in the graue whither thou goest ecclesiastes dauid saith in the graue no man will or can praise god and this is the cause wherefore paul doth so instantly vrge all man to take the present opportunitie beholde now is the acceptable time behold nowe is the day of saluation corinthian v hence we are taught to account euery day euen this present day as the day of death or the day of iudgement for we must doe all the good we can while we haue time now our time is the instant or present time for we are vncertaine whether we shall liue till to morrow or no iam therfore looke what we would doe at the houre of death if we were now at the last gaspe panting for breath or if we did see christ comming in the cloudes to iudgement the very same thing we ought to do euery day with like zeale and feruencie of sp t to praise and magnifie the mercie and goodnesse of god with like feare and trembling to worke out our owne saluation and to seeke re conciliation with like loue and sinceritie of affection to be beneficiall vnto our brother ampc vi this doctrine meeteth with all miserable minded me who hauing great meanes and opportunitie of doing good yet let slippe or rather cut off all occasions that might induce them thereto who in a brutish minde like to the sw ne neuer doe good nor profit any till their dying day i speake not against the laudible custome of bequeathing goods to go ly vses by a mans last will and testament but against those that doe little or no good all their life long till the houre of death let these man consider that as the late repentance of malefactours a little before their death is commonly but a ceremoniall repentance so the funerall beneficence of those who giue little or nothing in all their life is vsually no free but a formall and extorted gift formall in doing as others do torted in that it is giuen to stoppe the mouth of an accusing conscience the vitall beneficence is that which god accounteth of amp by so much to be preferred before the other but howe much it doeth more euidently declare a more liuely faith in the prouidence of god and a more vnfained loue of our brother againe they giue testimonie that they trust not in vncertaine riches but in the liuing god lastly they haue the benefit of poore mens praiers to whome they are beneficiall which otherwise they should want vii the circumstance of time hath here the force of an argument for it inforceth the exhortatio much that we should doe all the good we can and take the benefit of the opportunitie because time will not alway last the holy ghost in sundry places of scripture from the consideration of the shortnesse of our time enforceth the duties of faith repentance newe obedience as corinthian v and this i say brother because the time is short hereafter that both they that haue wiues be as though they had none and they that weepe as though they wept not and they that reioice as though they reioyced not ebr v to day if ye will heare his voice harden not your hearts and v exhort one another daily while it is called to day the godly in all ages haue practised this dutie peter knowing that the time was at hand that he was to lay downe his tabernacle stirres vp himselfe to greater diligence in his calling and saith i will not be negligent to put you in remembrance of these things so long as i am in this tabernacle seeing i know the time is at hand that i must lay it down as our lord jesus christ hath shewed me pet the church praieth thus to god teach vs to number our daies that is so to consider the shortnesse vncertaintie and vanitie of our life that we may apply our hearts to wisedome psalm but wicked mens practise is cleane contrarie for they take occasion vpon the shortnesse of their time to liue as they list to take their pleasures and to followe the lusts of their hearts therfore they say let vs eate and drinke for to morrowe we shall die esay our life is short and tedious and our time is as a shaddowe that passeth awaycome therefore and let vs enioy the pleasures that are present wisd v and hence it is that some spend their time in eating and drink and going gorgeously and faring delitiously euery day other in gaming carding dicing rioting revelling amp as the tearme is in swaggering wherin they followe their father the deuill who is therefore more full of wrath knowing that he hath but a short time apocrypha to these we may adde all such idle persons as followe no vocation or trade of life but day after day and yeare after yeare are still deuising new pastimes as they call them to trifle the time away these man hasten the iudgements of god and pull it vpon them before god inflict it it is a great iudgement of god for a man to be in that case that in the morning he shall say would god it were euening and in the euening would god it were morning deut in this case is euery idle loiterer who through idelenes is wearie of himselfe amp grieued the time passeth away so slowly and to these qui nihil agunt we may ioyne them qui male agunt and those also qui aliud agunt all which are condemned in this text amp against them titus the heathen emperour shall rise in iudgement and shall condemne them because he remembring on a time as he fate at supper that he had trifled away the day in doing nothing said amici hodie diem perdidi friends i haue lost this day ii ye see how large a letter i haue written vnto you with mine owne hand here beginneth the conclusion beeing the third generall part of this epistle consisting of two parts an insinuation in the ii verse amp a recapitulation in the verses following he insinuateth himselfe into the minds of the galatians by a twofold argument first from the largenes of his epistle ye see how large a letter i haue written secondly from the instrumentall cause in that he writ it with his owne hand where he giues authoritie to it and a kind of eminencie aboue his other letters and in both he commendeth his diligence loue and care which he had of them the word translated ye see is ambiguous and may be taken either as a commandement see how large a letter i haue written or as an assertion ye see the like ambiguitie is in the word philip and may be read either thus amongst whom you doe shine or see that you shine as starres it is not materiall in whether acception it be taken seeing the sense is all one the first argument to mooue the galatians to attention and acceptation of pauls paines and good affection is taken from the largenes of his epistle the word in the originall translated large is strangely wrested by sundrie interpreters without cause in psalm hilarie referring it to the loftines of sentences hyperius to the profunditie and depth of matter ierome to the greatnes of the character chrysostom and theophylact to the badnes of his hand as not beeing able to write well h imo to the hebrew character in which he wrote whereas the word doth not onely signifie qualitie but as properly quantitie as heb consider how great this man was and the word that answereth vnto it signifieth as well quantitie as qualitie coloss i would ye knew what great fight i haue iam behold how great a thing a little fire kindleth the plaine and simple meaning therefore of paul is this that he neuer wrote so long an epistle with his owne hand vnto any church as vnto them he writ indeede the epistle to philemon with his owne hand but that was short in comparison of this and he wrote larger epistles to other churches as to the romans corinthias ampc but by his scribes not with his owne hand therefore seeing this is the longest and largest letter that euer paul writ with his owne hand it ought to be more regarded and better accepted so that as his paines were greater in writing our diligence should be greater in reading and obseruing the same this shewes pauls great care of the churches not onely when he was present but when he was absent how painefull he was beeing among them to winne them to the gospel how fearefull when he was absent from the least their minds should be loauened by false teachers how faithfull both present and absent and it may serue as a president to all pastours hauing cure of soules to vse the like diligence and conscience in their ministerie that beeing absent in bodie from their charge vpon necessarie occasions as paul was yet they would be present in spirit with them and present by their letters that so they may testifie to all the world that they haue a greater care of the flocke then of the fleece it further teacheth vs that if the minister beeing carried with discreete zeale for the good of the church goe further either in word or writing then he intended or is thought fit by some as it seemes paul did in this place for what needes this large letter may some say a shorter would haue done as well that we are not to censure him or limite and prescribe him it had beene a great fault in the galatians if they had found fault with paul for this his large letter and in the disciples amp iewes if they should haue blamed his long sermon which continued at one time from morning to night act at another time from the closing of the euening till midnight act and so it is in many hearers who are too curious and strictt in prescribing and limiting their teachers to the time longer then which they cannot patiently indure and in stinting them in vrging of this or that point in saying he missed his rhetoricke his epimone was to long he was ouerseene in dwelling so long vpon the point it had beene better a word and away ampc his second argument is taken from the instrumentall cause that he wrote it with his owne hand in hac epistola sicut tradunt doctores ab hoc loco vs ad sinem proptia manuscripsit haimo saith it is the opinion of the doctours that paul wrote not this whole epistle with his owne hand but onely from hence to the ende which opinion is confuted by the very text you see how large a letter i have written with mine owne hand speaking of the whole epistle in the time past or if of any one part more then of another of the former part rather then of the latter secondly his assertion is not true for if we except ierome none of the ancients as i take it are of that opinion not vbi holographa manus falsum dici tion potest ambrose who saith where the whole writing is his owne hand there can be no falshood not in caeteris subscribebat quid em hic ver totam ipse scripsit chrysostom who saith to the rest of his epistles he did subscribe but this whole epistle he writ himselfe not primasius vsing the word perscripsit that he writ it through with his owne hand not totam vt videtur haue scripfit epistolam theodoret affirming that it seemes paul writ the whole epistle not edi sum minime apprim scribendi peritus compulsus sumtamen vel ea manu h c ad vos epistle scribere theophylact who bringeth in paul speaking to them in this manner i am enforced to write this epistle vnto you with mine owne hand not occumenius who calls it an epistle written with his owne hand not epistolam istam scripsi ego propri manu non notarii manu sed mea anselme who paraphrasing the text saith it is all one as if he had said this epistle i writ with mine owne hand and a little before not with the scribes hand but with mine owne hand albeit anselme cannot so preiudice his assertion who liued long after him not the author of the commentarie vpon the epistles ascribed to ierome tomorrow for he vpon the thess saith plainly his verbis omnes epistolas subscribebat excepta galatarum quam ex integro manu propria perscripsit with these words he subscribes all his epistles excepting that to the galatians which he writ from the beginning to the ende with his owne hand and vpon these very words which we now entreat of intelligite qum non imeam qui liter as manu mea nuper scripsi see how i am not afraid which of late time haue written with mine owne hand where by the way we may obserue that ierome is not the author of those commentaries beeing so contrarie to himselfe this i confesse is a light matter and not to be stood vpon were it not that some are too hastie to swallow whatsoeuer comes in their way vnder the title of the doctours it must therefore be a caueat vnto vs not to be too credulous in beleeuing euery one that shall auouch this or that to be the opinion of the fathers no though it be affirmed by a father especially by such a one as draweth neere the dregs as haimo doth it is certen then that paul writ this whole epistle with his owne hand the reasons are these first that it might appeare vnder his hand that he was no changeling but the same man that he was before in that he did not preach circumcision or the obseruation of iewish ceremonies as the false apostles standered him gal secondly that this his letter was not counterfaited by another and sent in his name as the false apostles might haue obiected and the galatians suspected thirdly that he might testifie his sincere loue towards them and how he did as it were trauaile in paine of them till christ were formed in them shunning no labour that might further their saluation we may hence further obserue a threefold difference of the bookes of scripture in the new testament some were neither written by an apostle nor subscribed as the gospel of marke and luke some subscribed but not written as the epistle to the romanes and others some both written and subscribed as this epistle and that to philemon verse i haue written it with mine owne hand j will recompense it now that paul subscribed euery epistle with his owne hand he himselfe witnesseth thessalon the salutation of me paul with mine own had which is a signe in euery epistle that it is mine amp not forged in my name by another so i write the grace of our lord iesus christ be with you all in which place he warneth the thessalonians againe of false teachers and forged letters for th he had besought them they would not be troubled by spirit nor by word nor by letter as though it came from him and here he shews how they may know whether the epistle be his or not if it haue this signe it is mine els it is counterfait for this note or marke is to be found in all and euery one of my epistles now these words which is a signe in euery epistle cannot be meant as some are of opinion of the former words onely viz the salutation of me paul with mine owne hand first because he saith it is a signe in euery epistle whereas it is onely to be found corinthian galat coloss thess philem v and not in any other of his epistles secondly the words so i write should be false if they be referred onely to the former wordes because that manner of salutation is not to be found in euery epistle as i haue alreadie shewed and except they be referred to the words following the grace of our lord iesus christ ampc they haue either none or a very hard construction thirdly if pauls salutation which he affirmeth to be a certaine note of his epistle be vnderstood of these words the grace of our lord iesus christ ampc it agreeth vnto all as anselme confesseth whereas beeing meant of the former words onely it doeth not agree to all but to a fewe and yet paul makes it a generall infallible note and signe of euery epistle besides ambrose and primasius in their commentaries vpon the place as also the author of the commentaries which goeth vnder ieroms name affirme the signe whereby we may know pauls epistles from counterfeit and forged epistles to consist in these words the grace of our lord ampc chrysost and theodoret likewise say that paul calleth the salutation a benediction or blessing which is in the end of the epistle and a little after hence we learne that he was accustomed to write these words the grace ampc instead of adiewe or farewell vnto the and haimo long after expounds these words so i write howe saith he euen thus as it followeth the grace of our lord ampc i graunt it is probable that paul writ his owne name in the ende of euery epistle whether in the greeke tongue and in the hebrewe characters as haimo affirmeth i leaue it as vncertaine and that by the salutation or signe of his epistle his name written with his owne hand is in part to be vnderstood yet it is not onely nor principally meant the certen signe therefore of his epistles is beside the subscription of his owne name the farewell that he giues them in these words the grace of our lord iesus christ be with you all or the like to the same effect i say to the same effect because these very formall wordes are not to be found in euery of pauls epistles therefore caietan is far wide who taketh the entire and formall salutation as it is literally set downe thess to be a note that the epistle is his so that if it want any one word either the epistle is not pauls or there is some defect in the text for hereupon he concludes that the epistle to the coloss onely hath something wanting in the farewell or salutation because it is said grace be with you and not the grace of our lord iesus christ be with you as it is in all his other epistles but first it is an vntrueth for they are not onely wanting in the epistle to the colossians but also in the to timothie and in that to titus where it is only said grace be with thee grace be with you all secondly it is a flat mistaking of the text for pauls meaning was not in euery epistle to tie himselfe precisely to so many words and syllables but to commend them to the grace of christ sometime making expresse mention of christ sometime concealing his name yet so as that it is alway vnderstood though not expressed as many as make a faire shew in the flesh compell you to be circumcised only because they would not suffer persecution for the crosse of christ from hence to the ende is laid down the second part of the conclusion which i call a recapitulation wherein the apostle doeth very artificially as orators are accustomed repeat those things which he would haue specially to be remembred the maine points handled in the epistle first that neither circumcision is necessarie to iustification nor the ceremoniall lawe to saluation secondly that the false apostles vrging the obseruation of the lawe as a thing necessarie to saluation sought not herein god glorie or the edification of their hearers but their owne ease and freedome from the crosse and persecution thirdly that christ crucified is the onely thing that iustifies a sinner without the workes of the lawe fourthly that true religion standeth not in outward things but in the renouation of the inward man in this verse and the next following paul describes the false apostles by fiue properties three whereof are laid downe in this verse the first is that they make a faire shewe the second that they compell man to the obseruing of their deuised religion the third the ende and scope they aime at that they may alway be in the sun shine liuing at ease and hauing the world at will onely because they would not suffer persecution for the crosse of christ first the apostle saith that they make a faire shew in the flesh which is taken diuersly for it signifieth sundrie things first to make an outward glorious shew according to the flesh as that they were true israelites of the seed of abraham ampc of which boasting paul speakes corinthian seeing that many glorie after the flesh i will glorie also they are israelites so am i they are the seed of abraham so am i secondly to please the israelites which are after the flesh and to approoue themselues vnto them which held the keeping of the ceremoniall lawe thirdly to vaunt themselues to the iewes and them of the circumcision of the galatians whome they had circumcised in the flesh as beeing made proselytes and wenne to their profession by their meanes lastly to pretend great zeale and religion in outward obseruing of the lawe standing in carnall rites and bodily exercises as circumcision meates purification and the like which carnall rites the apostle opposeth to spirituall worship rom and to the newe creature v of this chap and bodely exercise which profiteth little to true pietie and the sincere practise thereof which is profitable for all things tim the words may be taken in all these acceptions though princspally in the last here we haue a notable propertie of false teachers which is to set a faire face vpon the matter to carrie all before them with a smooth countenance and in outward appearance to excell for as satan though a blacke deuill an angel of darkenes doth change himselfe into a white deuill as though he were an angel of light so that a man can hardly distinguish his wicked suggestions from the good motions of the spirit of god and therefore may say as ioshua said to the angel article thou on our side or on our aduersaries ioshua so his instruments transform themselues as though they were the apostles of christ and ministers of righteousnesse corinthian in the old testament false prophets were accustomed outwardly to conforme themselues to the habite and attire of the holy man of god in wearing a rough garment as elijah and the rest of the prophets did zach vnder the newe testament in the time of christ the pharises in hypocrisie vnder a shewe of long praier deuoured widdowes houses matth in the apostles time false teachers with their wil worship as touch not taste not handle not which had a shewe of wisdome in voluntarie religion and humblenesse of minde and not sparing of the bodie did vndermine the religion of god coloss and after that in the primatiue church the heretickes called catharists vnder a shewe of holinesse fasting praier ampc did sowe most damnable heresies in the church and as in former times the iewes vnder the glorious titles of the children of abraham the schollers of moses the temple of the lord the temple of the lord made many proselytes by deceiuing the soules of the simple so at this day vnder the glorious titles of the church of councels fathers antiquitie consent vniuersalitie the pretented romane catholikes haue ensnared many a simple soule and no maruaile considering that these are the times of which christ foretold that false prophets should deceiue if it were possible the very elect matth and of which saint paul prophecied that antichrist should come through the efficacie of satan with all power and signes and lying wonders and in all deceiue ablenesse of vnrighteousnesse among them that perish thess and all this is done by outward shewes and semblances which our sauiour christ tearmeth sheepes cloathing and it stands in these foure particulars first in great swelling titles as the onely true catholike church the vicar of christ the oecumennicall bishop most profound illuminate angelicall seraphicall doctors iesuits the onely true followers of the doctrine and example of iesus ampc secondly in pretended zeale and deuotion whereby they would perswade that their religion is the onely true religion all others which swarue from it are nothing but false and fabulous and this they doe three waies first by hauing god alwaies in their mouthes crying in hypocrisie with the false prophets lord lord matth or as the iesuiticall faction doe iesu maria secondly with enticing words consisting in probable reasons and persuasiue arguments coloss thirdly with faire and flattering words to deceiue the hearts of the simple rom by which three meanes the jesuit haue preuailed much in princes courts in these latter daies apocrypha thirdly in the glorious outside of holinesse of life and conuersation in not sparing the bodie by whipping of themselues as baals priests lanced themselues till the blood gushed out king in strict fasts canonicall houres hard fare badde lodging course apparrell and such like lastly in rare and excellent gifts of prophecy tongues eloquence miracles ampc and thus they make pauls shew of godlinesse tim to be peter cloake of wickednesse pet so that as the deuill with faire words put eue into a fooles paradise till at length he had driuen her out of the terrestriall paradise and made her also hazard the celestiall so his ministers false teachers by faire and flattering speeches deceiue the minds of the simple and cause them to fall from their owne stabilitie by this we may see how hypocrites and false teachers stand especially vpon outward things as externall rites and ceremonies which are but deuices and doctrines of man matth the pharisies made much adoe about washing the outside of the cuppe and of the platter when as the inside was full of rapine and all vncleannes matth very curious about washing of their hands before meate mark and yet carelesse to wash their hearts fro wickednes ier precise in small matters as in tything of mint annise and cummine but profane in the practise of the waightier things of the law as iudgement mercie and fidelitie matth whited tombes faire without and filthie within v thus the popish worship consisteth especially in outward things which may please the senses of carnall man as in vocall and instrumental musicke to please the eare censings and perfumes to delight the smell guilding and painting with other sights and spectacles to affect the eye and at this day in the masse which they account the very marrow of their mattins there is nothing but dumme shews histrionicall gestures and tricks fitter to mocke apes withall then to edifie the people for whereas in former time they were wont to say let vs goe heare a masse now the common saying in italie is this let vs goe see a masse let vs therefore trie the spirits before we trust them and especially in matters of religion follow christs precept not to iudge by the outward appearance ioh but to iudge of prophets by the fruit of their doctrine matth and of their doctrine by the touch stone of the word isa so that though the deuill transforme himselfe into an angel of light nay though an angel from heauen preach any other thing beside that we haue receiued from christ we must hold him accursed and in so doing we shall follow christ his practise who was prudent in the feare of the lord and did not iudge by the sight of his eyes nor reprooue by the hearing of his eares isa the second note and marke of these false teachers is that they compell man to be circumcised the word compell hath great emphasis for it signifieth that they did not conuince the iudgement or perswade the will and affection of the galatians but enforced them against their wills for though circumcision be nothing of it selfe as paul saith yet to be compelled to receiue circumcision and to place iustification in the vse of it amp sinne in the neglect of it is the readie way to ouerturne christ the foundation of our saluation gal here suodrie questions are to be answered first it may be demanded whether it be lawful to compell man to embrace religion as the false apostles compelled the galatians to circumcisio ans the magistrate may amp ought to compell obstinate recusants to professe true religion for he is stos vtriusque tabulae and therefore is to haue care that true religion be professed and the contemners thereof punished an example hereof we haue in good king iosiah who caused all that were found in ierusalem and beniamin that is all his subiects to stand to the couenant which he made with the lord nay which is more he compelled all that were found in ierusalem to serue the lord their god chronicle among which multitude many there were no doubt which did like better of idolatry then of god worship as the word compelled doth import the king that made that great supper commanded his servant to copell the guests to come in vnto him luke whence augustine gathereth that it is the magistrates dutie to compell recusants schismatikes heretikes and such like to the hearing and professing of the word but here three things are commonly obiected against this doctrine obiect i to compell man to embrace true religion is to make them goe against their conscience which the magistrate ought not to doe as some papists haue asfirmed that they would not for tenne thousand worlds compell a iew to sweare that there were a blessed trinitie because he should be damned for swearing against his conscience although the thing were neuer so true ans i if it were so hainous a sinne to compell any to embrace true religion because it is against their conscience why doe popish prelates and magistrates compell protestant and that by exquisite torments to reconcile themselues to the church of rome to sweare obedience to the pope to acknowledge trasubstantiation and to heare masse which they know are directly against their conscience ii if they will not compell man to doe any thing though neuer so good or godly because it is against their conscience why should they not be as scrupulous in restraining them from doing that which is unlawful because they are perswaded in conscience they ought to doe it for if they compell man to omit that which they beleeue to be good because they know it to be euill as their owne practise prooueth in that they will not suffer protestant to pray publikely in a knowne tongue nor receiue the sacrament in both kinds ampc why doe they not compell them also to doe that which they know to be good though they thinke it to be euill iii the magistrate is to compell man to embrace true religion or to punish them for their obstinacie in not harkening to the word because he is to vse the meanes to reclaime them and to winne them to a loue and liking of the truth now so long as they are vrged to heare the word there is hope they may be wonne againe and experience shewes as augustine testifieth of the donatists that they which did professe religion at the first meerely by compulsion may afterwards by the mercie of god professe it onely for deuo ion and what though some come not to learne but to carpe and cauill yet god may cast the nette of his mercie so farre ouer them that contrarie to their purpose they may be caught iiii if the magistrate who may compell them and so reclaime them doe suffer them to continue in their errours or heresies without controlment he is guiltie of their sinne but by compelling them he hath discharged his dutie for albeit they beeing compelled doe dissemble and play the hypocrites doe lie and forsweare themselues that is not the magistrates sinne who intendeth nothing but their conuersion and saluation it is their owne proper and personall sinne obiect ii man ought to be perswaded to embrace religion and induced to beleeue but not compelled for the will can not be compelled ans true it is the will cannot be compelled and as true is it likewise that the magistrate doth not compell any to beleeue for when a man doth beleeue and from his heart embrace true religion he doth it willingly notwithstanding meanes are to be vsed to make them willing that are vnwilling and the meanes is to compell them to come to our assemblies to heare the word and to learne the grounds of true religion for it is god commandement man should prooue the spirits ioh that so they may know the truth and cleaue vnto it augustine saith fitly and finely to this purpose quod autem vobis videtur invites ad veritatem non esse cogend erratis nescientes scripturas neque virtutem dei qui eos volentes facit dum coguntur inviti secondly when papists receiue the sacrament sweare allegeance to their prince present themselues in our congregations who knowes that they doe these things against their conscience nay rather we ought in charitie to thinke that they are perswaded in conscience they may doe them when by oath and protestation they confesse so much but be it they did all in hypocrisie shall the execution of godly lawes therefore cease because hypocrites will not obey but in dissimulation obiect iii the magistrate by compelling recusants to the outward profession of religion maketh them to play the hypocrites to counterfai and dissemble ans the magistrate in executing the lawes hath no such intent but onely that they might heare the word beleeue it and be saued againe protestant recusants in other country are not allowed by papists to alleadge their conscience for their refusall but are compelled either to conforme themselues or to vndergoe cruell torments no more may such pretence of conscience excuse the papists or other heretikes but that they should receiue the same measure which they mete to others ii quest how can it be truly said that the false apostles compelled man to receiue circumcision seeing titus was not compelled to be circumcised gal ans that place maketh nothing against the text in hand the meaning is that paul for his part was readie to haue circumcised titus as he did timothie act rather then offend the weake brother but when it came to this point that they would needes vrge circumcision as a thing necessarie to saluation paul refused to do it for all the false brother that crept in v that is notwithstanding they laboured by all meanes to bring it in vse againe neither did the apostles vrge it or require it as a thing necessarie to saluation iii it may be demaunded whether that circumcision beeing so vehemently vrged by the false apostles might not haue beene vsed answer it might not for albeit it be in it selfe a thing indifferent and so it skilleth not whether a man be circumcized or not as paul saith circumcision is nothing and vncircumcision is nothing yet beeing vrged as a matter o absolute necessitie as without which man could not be saued act it ought not to be vsed the like may be said of all indifferent things if they be made essentiall p rts of god worship or necessarie to saluation as the vse of meates and drinkes obseruing of times and seasons wearing this or that habit or attire forbidding of mariage to some orders of me for when things indifferent are made necessarie the nature of them is changed vpon this ground ezekiah brake in peeces the brasen serpent when the israelites began to worship it king first let vs obserue out of these words they compell you to be circumcised that paul doeth not only vse christian pollicie but dealeth very rhetorically excusing the galatians as though they were constrained against their wills to doe as they did amp laying all the blame vpon the false apostles and so doth closely alienate their affection from these seducers who would haue them circumcised either by voluntary submission or by violent compulsion the like godly pollicie we ought to vse in dealing against heretikes and false teachers that the peoples mindes may be estranged from them amp take no loue of their doctrine nor liking of their persons here we haue a second note of false teachers which is not onely to retaine ceremonies themselues but to vrge them vpon others and constraine man to the obseruing of them for they were more earnest and forward in vrging circumcision their owne deuise then the keeping of the morrall lawe and so are all seducers the pharises did vrge their owne ceremonies as washing before meate washing of pottes cuppes and beddes ampc more then the commandement of god and the papists vrge the len fast more strictly the fasting from finne which is the onely true fast isay and their owne stories doe shewe that man haue beene more seuerely punished for eating flesh vpon good friday then for commi ing of simple fornication or following of strange flesh they stand more in vrging the outward worshipping of an image or a peece of bread then the inward spirituall worship and as they haue made the saints daies equall with the sabboth daies so haue they made the prophanation of them an equall sinne and haue punished it with equall punishment it is further to be obserued howe they abuse circumcision for whereas by god ordinance it was but a seale of the righteousnesse of faith rom they peruerting the end of it make it a meritorious cause of saluation and therefore compell man to be circumcised it is god worke they make it their owne worke yes such a worke as by which they hope to be saued and this their dealing may fitly be paralleled by the popish practise at this day in making baptisme which is but a signe and seale of grace to be the proper immediate and physicall cause of conferring grace by the worke wrought almes praier and fasting which are but signes and testimonies of iustification to be causes thereof nay their owne deuises of confession satisfaction supererogation to be meritorious causes of iustification amp saluation lastly see here howe the peruersenesse of the corrupt heart of man doth thwart the ordinance of god as long as circumcision was commaunded by god most abhorred it for the heathen testifie so much that the iewes were odious for it but nowe beeing abolished they take it vp againe receiue it and vrge it as a thing necessarie to be obserued vpon paine of damnation whereas if god should enioyne it againe they would no doubt account it as heauie yoke which neither they nor their fathers were able to beare this improuing of that which god comands amp approuing that which he forbids argues the great corruption of the heart and that the wisedome of the flesh is not onely an enemie but euen flat enmitie against god rom it must therefore teach vs to captiuate our reason and to subiect our wills to the will of god in all things the third propertie of these false apostles is the teaching of circumcision that is of false doctrine because they would not suffer persecution for the crosse of christ that is for preaching the true doctrine of the gospel concerning christ crucified it may be demanded whether it was necessarie that those which taught not circumcision but spake against it should be persecuted to which i answer that it was necessarie according as paul affirmeth gal if i teach circumcision why doe j yet suffer persecution the reason was this the romane emperour had giuen libertie to the iewes to liue according to their owne lawes and that without molestation or disturbance in all places of the romane emperie so that if a iewe became a christian he had the priuiledge of a iewe so long as he kept the ceremoniall lawe and taught no departing from moses whereas they which taught that ceremonies were abrogated and that man were iustified onely by faith in christ wanted this priuiledge and so were persecuted of no man more then of the iewes either by themselues or by incensing others against them thess the false apostles therefore to auoide persecution coyned a newe gospel in matter of saluation ioyning christ and moses iustification by faith and by workes so that here we haue another character and marke of false teachers which is to labour by all meanes to enioy the world and to eschewe the crosse and rather then they wil suffer persecution to make a hotch potch of religion as we may see not onely by this particular but by the course of the historie of the church and in latter times by the interim vnder charles the fift and the sixe articles vnder henry the eight by our mediators and reconciliators who either as it is said of old consiliator labour to accord fire and water or else like hucksters mixe wine and water for their owne aduantage and by all neuters and mungrils in religion who houer in the winde because they would stand sure for all assaies or winne the fauour of great man that they might not stand in the way of their preferment this is the sinne of the multitude among vs who desire to haue christ but they will none of his crosse they would be with him vpon mount tabor but not not vpo mount caluarie crowned with glorie but not crowned with thornes further we may hence gather an essentiall difference of true and false teachers the one seekes the good of the church the other seeks theselfe the one the glorie of god the other their owne glorie it is obserued by popish priests and others that though the iesuits pretend they doe all things in ordine ad deum yet they intend themselues doing all things in ordine ad seipsos it beeing the marke they shoote at in all their machiavellian plottes and pollicies that they may haue cum digmeate ocium a lordly command and a lasie life againe here we see that the loue of the trueth and of the world the feare of the face of man and the feare of god can neuer stand together as also howe dangerous a thing it is to be addicted to the loue of the world for it hath beene alwaies the cause of reuolt in that man neuer imbraced religion so as that they could be contented to suffer persecution for the profession of it nor lay downe their liues in the maintenance thereof matth as soone as tribulation or persecution commeth by and by they are offended whereas we ought to haue the same minde that paul had who knowing that bonds and imprisonment aboad him yet passed not for them neither was his life deare vnto him act and was not onely readie to be bound but to die also for the name of the lord iesus act the reasons which should make vs willing to take vp our crosse and follow christ are these first it is a great mercy and fauour of god that we are accounted worthy to suffer any thing for his sake act the apostles departed from the counsell reioycing that they were accounted worthy to suffer rebuke for his name secondly it is a meanes by the mercifull promise of god to procure and obtaine the blessings of this life mark thirdly it hath blessednes annexed to it with a promise of assistance and helpe of god spirit pet if ye berailed on for the name of christ blessed are ye for the spirit of glorie and of god resteth vpon you which on their part is euill spoken of but on your part is glorified lastly the ende of the crosse is glorie vnspeakable if we suffer with him we shall also be glorified with him rom further whereas saint paul linketh together persecution and the preaching of the crosse we may see that the profession of the gospel and persecution doe either goe hand in hand or doe follow one another inseperably for as many as will liue godly in christ iesus must suffer persecution tim moses is said to haue chosen rather to suffer affliction with the people of god then to enioy the pleasures of sinne for a season heb where we see that affliction is the lette and portion of the godly the reason hereof is two fold the malice of the devil who is alway nibbling at the heele gen and the hatred of the malignant church the devil seede euer maligning the church and people of god the deuill maketh war with the remnant of the womans seede which keepe the commandement of god and haue the testimonie of iesus apocrypha the malignant church persecuteth the church of god as we may see in their types namely in caine hating and persecuting abel ismael isaac esau iacob which they did onely because they saw their owne workes to be euill and theirs to be good ioh and if it be demaunded why those that preach the word plainely and powerfully to the consciences of man in euidence of the spirit are so extreamely hated and maligned ans it is for no other thing but euen for the workes sake for which they ought to be reuerenced thess and because they prophecie not good vnto them but euill king that is preach not pleasing things by sowing pillowes vnder their elbowes and lulling them asleepe in the bedde of securitie but denounce the iudgements of god against them and so disquiet and trouble their guiltie consciences and what i beg you is the reason why those that make conscience of sinne are so maligned of the wicked world and branded with the blacke names of puritans and precisians but this which our sauiour christ giueth ioh because they are not of the world therefore the world hateth them now all this commeth to passe by reason of that enmitie which god hath put between the woman and the serpent his seede and her seede gen this teacheth vs first that we should suspect our selues that our hearts are not found nor our practise sincere when all man speake well of vs for true profession is alwaies accompanied with persecution woe be to you when all man speake well of you luke secondly that we must not be discouraged in our profession though there be neuer so many that make opposition or so mightie that raise persecution against vs though they tell vs as they did paul act concerning this sect we know that euery where it is spoken against or take vs vp with nicodemus ioh article thou also of galile search and looke for out of galile ariseth no prophet in these blasts and stormes of temptatios we ought to make that saying of christ our anker hold blessed is he that is not offended in me mat lastly that we thinke it not strange when we finde affliction or meete with persecution pet for they which are circumcised keepe not the law but desire to haue you circumcised that they might glorie in your flesh here the apostle preuenteth and obiection which might be made against his former conclusion v for it might be said paul did them wrong in standering them to vrge circumcision onely because they would auoid persecution when as they did it as zealous obseruers of the law to this he answereth negatiuely that whatsoeuer they did pretend they intended no such thing and he prooueth his former assertion by two arguments and withall describeth the false apostles by two other properties his first reason may be framed thus if they did vrge circumcision as beeing zealous of the law and hauing conscience of the obseruing thereof they would keepe it themselues as well as compell others to the keeping of it but they keepe it not themselues therefore they vrge it not in conscience to haue it obeied but for some sinister ende the second reason is this they that propound no other end to themselues in vrging of circumcision but vaunting and boasting in the flesh they seeke not the obseruation of the law but these seducers vrge circumcision and other ceremonies that they might glorie in the flesh therefore they seeke not the obseruation of the law so that here we haue two other properties of false teachers the first is to compell man to the obseruing of that which they will not obserue themselues for thus these seducers vrged the ceremoniall law resembling herein the scribes and pharisies who bound heauie burdens and grieuous to be borne and laid them on mens shoulders whereas they themselues would not mooue them with one of their fingers matth the popes and prelates of the roman church are notorious in this kind in vrging man to make conscience of that which they themselues will not keepe to practise that which they will not performe and to beleeue that which they count false and fabulous for first they strictly require regular obedience to be performed of their nouices and others to their generals or gouernours specially to the vicar of christ and see of rome whereas they will not be subiect to the higher powers as they ought rom nor obedient to gouernours as it is required pet nay their practise is notorious in these foure particulars first in freeing children from obedience to their parents secondly in exempting their shauelings from subiection to the ciuill magistrate thirdly in freeing subiects from their oath of allegeance to their soueraignes and lastly by aduancing that man of sinne aboue all that is called god or worshipped and giuing him power to depose princes to dispose of crownes and kingdomes and to impose lawes which shall properly bind the conscience yes to tread kings and emperours vnder his feete and cause them like vassalls to hold his stirrop againe they compell others to fast especially in lent when as they in the meane time feast their fast beeing to eate fast and drinke fast in mortifying the flesh with their indian capons and peacocks and that vpon good friday whereas to eate white meates vpon that day should be in others a mortall sinne further they beare the poore people in hand that indulgences are meanes to remit sinnes and that those that are excommunicated by the pope are in a damnable estate whereas many of them account popes bulls to be but bullae meere trifles and such as buy them starke tooles witnesse the speech of the duke of ualence bastard to pope alexander the sixt who hauing lost certaine thousand crownes at a throw at the dice tush said he these are but the sinnes of the germans and that of charles the fift though a fauourer and maintainer of the romane religion who beeing menaced by pope paulus the third with excommunication if he would not yeeld vp playsance into his hands let him vnderstand by his embassadour that he would thunder at s angelo with his canons and artillerie if he would needes be thundering out his excommunications lastly they vrge confession of purgatorie almost as an article of faith whereas some of them are so farre from beleeuing it as that they thinke there is neither heauen nor hell witnesse the speech of pope leo the tenth to cardinall bembu o bembus what riches haue we gotten by this fine fable of iesiu christ by this we are contrarily admonished to practise that we professe the ministers of the word especially ought verba vertere in opera as ierome speaketh that is to turne words into works that their liues may be reall sermons to the people for otherwise they pull downe with one hand as fast as they build with another let vs consider how peters badde example is saide to haue compelled the gentiles to liue as the iewes gal for actions abide and are of force when words passe as the winde moreouer vpon this dependeth another propertie of seducers which is to set a faire glosse vpon the matter and to wake the world beleeue they doe these and these things for such and such endes as these false teachers did pretending religion and conscience but intending freedome from the crosse and their owne vaine glorie whereas they meane nothing lesse like herod who made shew of worshipping christ when his purpose was to haue destroied him matth this propertie and practise is and hath beene vsuall specially in the church of rome for generally they would haue the world beleeue that the popes triple crowne amp hierarchie of that sea is for the maintenance and defence of the gospel whereas all the world knowes it is onely to keepe their kitchins hot to vphold their persian pompe and ambitious tyrannie particularly there be two politicke practises of theirs which prooue the point in hand first it is well knowne that popes haue neuer ceased from time to time to sollicite the princes of europe to maintaine the holy war as they call it pretending the recouerie of the holy land out of the hands of the turkes and sarracins when as at least in the beginning they intended nothing lesse but that by this meanes they might set the east and west together by the eares whilst they plaied their parts at home in italie the second is their shrift or auricular confession which they practise for this end as they say that they may pacifie distressed consciences by absoluing them of their sinnes when as the truth is they first brought it into the church and doe still continue it in a politicke respect as beeing the onely way in the world to know all the secret purposes plots pollicies and practises that are either in church or commonwealth we are therefore here admonished to take heed of dissembling in making christianitie a cloake of impietie or to pretend one thing and intend another like the heart pointing vpward and poising downeward for that will be a farre fowler soloecisme the that which the heathen comitted with his had in pointing to heauen whe he spake of the earth but let vs alway labour for sinceritie to be at least that which we pretend to be or rather like salomons temple whose windowes were larger within then without and not like the glow worme making a faire glittering shewe of that which we haue not v but god forbidde that i should glory saue in the crosse of our lord iesus christ whereby the world is crucified to me and i vnto the world in these words paul comes to the reddition of the dissimilitude between him and the false apostles his glorying and theirs in them we may consider two generall points first wherein he would not glory in nothing saue in ampc secondly the thing wherein he would glorie in the crosse of christ whereof he renders a reason in the words following taken from the effects which the crosse wrought in him for by it the world was crucified to him and he vnto the world for the first to glorie implies three things first to reioice exult and triumph in a mans selfe in regard of some good thing or some supposed good secondly to bewray this great exultation by speech or action or both thirdly by boasting of it to looke for praise and applause of man which glorying according to the nature of the obiect and the ende is either good or euill for if it haue a right obiect namely the crosse of christ and a right ende the glorie of god it is good otherwise it is euill such as was this glorying of the false apostles and all other carnall glorying which is not in the lord for it is nothing els but vain glorie vain i say first in regard of the things wherin man glorie which are either such as are not as when man boasteth of that which he hath not but would seeme to haue or such as he hath not of himselfe corinthian or such as haue no continuace but are transitorie and fading as all earthly things are seeing man himselfe is but as grasse and all the glorie of man but as the floure of the field isay secondly it is vaine in regard of man from whome we looke for glorie and admiration seeing his iudgement is erroneous thirdly in regard of the ende in not referring it to the maine and proper ende the glorie of god and the good of his church the prophet reduceth all those things wherein we ought not to glorie to three heads wisedome strength riches all which we haue receiued amp thereof ought not to boast of them as though we had not receiued them in particular wisedome is not to be glorified in seeing it is very defectiue whether we speake of speculatiue wisedome standing in contemplation or practical consisting in action for in artes and sciences as also in the secrets of nature our ignorance is greater then our knowledge he that knowes not that be knowes nothing in these things let him read the booke of iob chap and and and as for wisedome in diuine things we knowe nothing as we ought to knowe corinthian for we know but in part and see but as in a glasse darkely corinthian and as for practicall wisdome standing in pollicie it is not demonstratiue but meerely coniecturall amp therefore we cannot build vpon it considering in it there is the concurrence of so many causes that are casuall and of so many mindes which are mutable salomon the great polititian had experience hereof for he thought that by ioining affinitie with his neighbour princes round about him amp taking their daughters to be his wiues he should establish his own house strengthen his kingdome and drawe the heathenish idolatours to the worship of the true god but all things fell out contrarie to this his plot and proiect for it was so farre from winning others to imbrace true religion as that it drewe him to idolatry and so farre from stablishing his house or strengthening his kingdome as that it was the cause of the rending of the one and the ruinating of the other constantine the great was perswaded that by building the citie constantinople in the confines of europe and asia and there placing one of his sonnes as his lieutenant to keepe his court he should fortifie his empire as with a wall of brasse but he was deceiued for the building of new rome was the decay of the olde and the diuiding of the empire was the destruction thereof so that it is truely said pollicie is often the ouerthrowe of politie nowe if wisedome may not be gloried in much lesse may strength seeing that wisedome is better then strength ecclesiastes seeing that the greatest strength of man is not comparable to that of behemoth iob and other bruite beast seeing it is but the strength of flesh seeing no power nor might can deliuer from wrath in the day of wrath of all the puissant princes and plotting polititians the psalmist saith they are so vaine that if they be laid vpon the ballance euen vanitie it selfe will waigh them downe psalm and as for riches besides that they make vs neuer a whitte the better nay oftentimes much worse they are also vncerten salomon saith they make themselues wings like an eagle and flie away pro they may not vnfitly be compared to ionas his gourd which flourished in the morning yeelding him content amp delight but shortly after to his great griefe it was stricken by a worme and withered away the like may be said of honours and pleasures for what more vaine then to glorie in honour which is not in a mans power seeing as the philosopher teacheth honour is not in him that is honoured but in him that honoureth and therefore courtiers are compared to counters which stand sometime for pounds sometime for pence beeing now aduanced now debased according to the pleasure of the prince haman to day highly honoured in the court at shushan the next day hanged vpon a tree to omit the examples of iob and nebuchodonosar in whome we may see the mutabilitie of worldly dignitie consider it in the glasse of these examples first of geliner a puissant prince of the vandals who was brought so lowe that he was enforced to request his friend to send him a loafe of bread a sponge and a harpe a loafe to slake his hunger a sponge to drie vp his teares a harpe to solace him in his miserie of bellisarius for prowes amp honour the only man then liuing who came to that miserable estate that hauing his eies put out he was led in a string to beg by the high way side crying date obolum bellisario and of the victorious emperour henry the fourth who had fought pitched fields and yet was driuen to that exigent as that he became a suter for a poore prebend in the church of spira to maintaine himselfe in his olde age and as for worldly pleasures least cause is there that any man should glorie in them seing they are more vanishing then the former seeing they are common to vs with bruite beast seeing they are mingled with much griefe and vexation for in the midst of laughter the heart is sorrowfull prou and lastly seeing they leaue a sting behinde them for the ende of pleasure is nothing but paine as salomon saith the ende of reioycing is mourning for feasting amp banquetting are often turned into surfetting amp vomiting drinkings into palsies lusts into goutes ampc and if pleasures were but onely painefull the matter were the lesse but they are also sinnefull ebr and therefore in no wise to be gloried in by this we see that paul had iust cause in this earnest manner to say god forbidde i should glorie saue in the crosse of christ considering that this boasting in outward things is not onely a fault of vanitie but also of impietie as may appeare by these reasons i god hath expressely forbidden it ier gal ii he hath alwaie seuerely punished it as in dauid for numbring the people in a vaine glorious minde sam in ezekias for shewing his treasures in a brauery to the embassadours of the king of babel isay in herod for ascribing to himselfe the glorie proper to god alone act iii the saints of god haue alway abhorred it as paul doth in this place and corinthian if i must needs glorie i will glory in neine infirmities as if he should say i will be farre from carnall boasting iv the heathen by the light of nature haue condemned it the gretian orator calls it an odious and burdensome thing and the romane orator prooues it be most true by his own practise making his words which flowed from his mouth as sweete as hony to taste as bitter as wormewood by interlacing his owne praises obiect i paul gloried in something besides the crosse of christ when he said it were better for him to die then that any should make his glorying vaine corinthian answer paul in glorying doeth distinguish his calling from his person of such a one i wil boast of my selfe i wil not boast amp i was nothing inferior to the very cheife apostles although i am nothing corinthian of his person or personall gifts he boasteth not but onely of his apostolicall calling and his faithfull discharge thereof to the end he may stoppe the mouthes of the false apostles thus to confesse the good things we haue to the glorie of god beeing vrged thereunto is lawful boasting nay it is sometime necessarie making much for the maintenance of the gospell as pauls boasting made much for the good of the church of corinthian againe there is a twofold lawful boasting one before god another before man rom of the former the apostle speakes in this verse of the latter in the corinthian he gloried not in the testimony of a good conscience before god but onely before man before god he glorified in nothing but in the sauing knowledge of christ and him crucified and whereas it may besaide that this his boasting in regard of the false apostles as also his glorying in the testimonie of his conscience corinthian and in his infirmities corinthian were not in the crosse of christ i answer they were for his glorying ouer the false apostles in teaching freely was in the good and prosperous successe of the gospel which is the doctrine of the crosse and his glorying in the testimonie of his conscience in that it was washed by the blood of the crosse as paul speakes coloss in his afflictions in that they were the afflictions of christ and he by them made conformable to him but it will be said that he gloried in his reuelations in his paines and trauell in preaching the gospel and in the multitude of churches which he had planted ans first he did it beeing vrged thereunto secondly he did it to defend his calling and the credit of the gospel and therefore this boasting was not unlawful nay it was necessarie and in the lord for when we are compelled we may confesse the good things we haue if we doe it sparingly and for the edification of others that they may be bettered by our example and that they seeing our good workes may glorifie god our heauenly father matth here we see what glorying is unlawful namely when man ascribe vnto themselues either that which they haue not or more then they haue or as proceeding from themselues their wisdome strength industrie in sacrificing to their owne netts and burning incense to their owne yearne habac or in boasting of them without necessarie cause either for their owne vaine glorie as nebuchodonosor did daniel or not for god glorie as herod did act and if this glorying be so greata sinne surely boasting in wickednes as doeg did psalm must needes be most damnable as when the greatest swearers and swaggerers count themselues the best companions the greatest idolaters and superstitious persons most religious the greatest oppressours surfeters drunkards fighters most valiane and couragious ampc now this may be done three waies either ignoratly as whe paul gloried in his cruel persecuting of the saints before his couersion act or presumptuously when man glorie in wickednes notwithstanding they be perswaded in conscience that it is euill and then it is the sinne of sodom isa or malitiously to despite god and then it is the sinne against the holy ghost the second point to be considered in the words is the thing wherein he will glorie called here the crosse of christ sane in the crosse of our lord iesus christ the words in the originall translated saue are exceptiue as if he should say i will glorie in nothing except in the crosse of christ and exclusiue onely in the crosse of christ and in nothing els albeit they are sometime aduersatiue as gal and apocrypha there shall enter into it no vncleane thing but they that are written ampc where the words are not exclusiue for then it would follow that some which worke abomination should enter into heauen but aduersatiue as matth and luke which may serue by the way to cleare the text ioh those thou gauest me haue i kept and none of them is lost but the child of perdition that is but the child of perdition is lost for the words as i take it are not so well translated by the exceptiue coniunction nisi as by the aduersatiue sed seeing here is no exceptio made of iudas as though he had beene giuen to christ amp afterward had fallen away which exposition must needes be made if the words be read nisi filius perditionis further by the crosse of christ the apostle vnderstandeth synecdochically the all sufficient expiatorie and satisfactorie sacrifice of christ vpon the crosse with the whole work of our redemption in the sauing knowledge where of he professeth he will glorie and boast for christ is made vnto vs wisdome righteousnesthat as it is written he that glorieth should glorie in the lord euen to make boast of him all the day long as the psalmist speaketh and the reason why paul professeth that he will glorie onely in the crosse of christ is because christ crucified is the treasurie and storehouse of the church seeing that in him are hid not onely the treasures of wisdome and knowledge coloss but of bountie and grace ioh and of all spirituall blessings ephesians for first by christ crucified we haue reconciliation with god remission of sinns amp acceptation to eternall life secondly we haue the peace of god which passeth all vnderstanding peace with god with angels with man with our selues with the creatures thirdly we recouer the right and title which we had in the creation to all the creatures and blessings of god corinthian fourthly all afflictions and iudgements cease to be curses and punishments and become either trialls or corrections lastly death it selfe is no death but a sleepe for all that die in the lord are said to sleepe and to rest vpon their beddes isa indeede if we looke vpon death through the glasse of the law it is the very downefall to eternall destruction but if we consider it as it is changed by the death of christ it is but a passage from this trans torie life to eternall life christ by his death hath taken away sinne the sting of death so that though it seaze vpon vs yet hauing lost it sting it cannot hurt vs so that in a word in christ crucified are all things that a man can glorie of if we would glorie in knowledge and wisdome he is the wisdome of the father seeing that all treasures of wisdome and knowledge are hid in him and therefore paul desired to know nothing among the corinthians but brist and him crucified corinthian for this knowledge is eternall life ioh if in the loue and fauour of great man by him we are highly aduanced into the loue amp fauour of god ephesians if in honors amp riches by him we are made kings and priests apocrypha if in libertie by him we are deliuered from the hands of our enemy sinne satan ampc luke if in pleasures comfort and content he is our felicitie in him we are coplete coloss by him we haue right to those things which eye hath not seene eare hath not heard neither can the heart of man conceiue it may be said why doth paul glorie in the ignominious death of christ rather then in his glorious resurrection triumphant ascension and imperiall iurisdiction now sitting at the right hand of the father ans these are not excluded but included in the crosse yet he nameth the crosse rather then them first of all to shew that vpon the crosse christ did fully finish the worke of our redemption for beeing now readie to giue vp the ghost he said it is finished ioh this made paul to desire to know nothing but christ and him crucified corinthian for in his humiliation stads our exaltation in his weaknes stands our strength in his ignominie our glorie in his death out life secondly to shew that he was not ashamed of the crosse of christ though neuer so ignominious in the eyes of the world it had beene no great thing for paul to haue gloried in the resurrection ascension wisdome power maiestie of christ wherein the world can and doth glorie but to glorie in the shamefull contempuble accursed death of the crosse was a matter of great difficultie and the worke of faith iudging that which the world counts ignominious to be most glorious that which the learned philosophers counted foolishnes to be the wisdome of god corinthian the popish sort abuse this text two waies first in applying it to the transient crosse secondly to the permanent or materiall crosse to the transient crosse in that they glorie in it first as hauing a vertue in it when it is made in the ayre to driue away deuills secondly beeing made in the forehead to be as an amulet against charmes blastings and other such like casualties to the materiall crosse when they adorne it with golde and iewells and so cause it to be carried in great pompe before them when the crucigeri weare it in their hats in a white redde or greene colour when they put their confidence in it and pray vnto it holy crosse saue vs this is popish and carnall glorying in the crosse and not spirituall in the death of christ vpon the crosse of which onely the apostle speakes in this place the reason why he would glorie in nothing but in the crosse of christ followeth to be considered in these words by which the world is crucified to me and i vnto the world it is taken from a double effect which christ or the crosse of christ wrought in him for the words by which may be referred to either indifferently the first to be crucified to the world the second the world to be crucified to him by the world we are not to vnderstand the frame of heauen and earth not the creatures nor mankind but honour riches pleasures fauour wisdome glorie and whatsoeuer is opposed to the kingdome of christ and the new creature to be crucified to the world is to be dead vnto it to despise and contemne it to count all the glorie of it to be no better then dongue in respect of christ and his righteousnes as paul did philipp the world is said to be crucified to vs when it hates and persecutes vs and accounts vs the filth amp the off scouring of all things corinthian yet here obserue that we are crucified to the world and the world to vs by the vertue of the death of christ after a different manner we are crucified to the world properly by the spirit of christ weaning our affections from the loue of this world the world is cruci fied to vs by the death of christ improperly and by accident in that we are made such as the world cannot but hate and persecute for seeing we are made new creatures and chosen out of the world therefore the world hateth vs ioh here we see who those are that can truly glory in the crosse of christ namely those that are dead to the world amp the world to them such as feele the power of the spirit of christ crucifying the flesh in them with the affections and lusts others can no more glory of the crosse of christ then he that glories of the victorie which his prince hath gotte ouer his enemy himselfe in the meane time beeing a vassall and slaue vnto them secondly that it is not sufficient for a christian that the world is crucified to him except he also be crucified to the world neither louing the world nor the things in the world thirdly that to be crucified to the world is not to professe monasticall life and to be shut vp in a monastery but to renounc the world and the corruptions that are therein both in affection of hart and practise of life fourthly we are taught to carrie our selues to the world as crucified and dead man not to loue nor like it to seeke or affect it but to renounce and forsake it with all the vanities delights and pleasures thereof and to be as dead man to our own wicked wils and to our carnall reason letting them lie dead in vs and suffering our selues to be ruled ordered and guided by the spirit of god making his will our will his word our wisedome fiftly by this we may examine our hearts for if we haue our affections glued to the world and set vpon the honours pleasures profit and preferments thereof we are worldlings indeed for they that are christs are crucisied with christ gal and haue crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts gal and therefore must needs be crucified to the world a man that is hanged vpon a gybbet ceaseth from his thefts and murders so all that are indeed crucified with christ to the world cease from their old offences for as the apostle reasoneth if we be risen with christ we ought to seeke the things that are aboue amp not the things that are vpon the earth column so if we be dead with christ from the vanities of the world we ought as dead man to abstaine from all worldly lusts which fight against the soule pet v for in christ iesus neither circumcifio availeth any thing nor vncircumcision but a new creature here the apostle prooues his former assertion v that he neither did nor ought to glorie in any thing saue in the crosse of christ because nothing is of any account in the kingdome of god but a newe creature and this he prooues by the remoouall of all those things that are either opposite to or diverse from a newe creature signified by circumcision and vncircumcision and withall he laies downe two conclusions the first is that in christ iesus that is in the kingdome of grace neither circumcision nor vncircumcision are any thing that is are neither acceptable to god nor auaileable to saluation vnder these two synecdochically comprehending all outward priuiledges and prerogatiues dignities and regalities or whatsoeuer can be named vnder circumcision comprising the preheminence of the iewe and the profit of circumcision which was much euery way rom seeing that to them appertained the adoption and the glory and the couenants and the giuing of the lawe and the seruice of god and the promises rom vnder circumcision containing the gentiles with all their wealth wisdome strength lawes pollicie and whatsoeuer is of high account and glorious in the eies of the world all which he exclude and accounts as nothing in respect of regeneration for that which is highly accounted of among man is abomination in the sight of god luke therefore wisedome wealth nobility strength are nothing corinthian outward callings as to be king or kaesar prophet or apostle outward actions of fasting almes praier nay kindred and alliance as to be mother or brother of christ is nothing for if the blessed virgine had not borne christ in her heart as she did in her wombe she should neuer haue beene saued luke amp if his kinsmen had not beene his brother by spirituall adoption as well as by naturall propagation they should haue had no inheritance in the kingdome of god mark nay the outward element of baptisme without the inward grace is of no force for it is not the washing away of the filth of the flesh that is acceptable to god but the stipulation of a good conscience which maketh requests vnto god pet and if the communicant at the lord table doe not eate panem dominu as well as panem domini as augustine speaketh that is if he doe not receiue christ spiritually by the hand of his faith as he doth corporally receiue the element by his bodely hand he receiueth vnworthily and so eateth and drinketh his owne iudgement corinthian now the reason why these outward things are nothing availeable is because the things that are accounted of with god are spirituall and eternall not temporall and carnall as these are which as they shall vtterly cease in the kingdome of glory matth for then christ will put downe all rule authoritie and power corinthian so are they not of any moment or account in the kingdome of grace as paul teacheth corinthian gal coloss it may be said these priuiledges and outward things as prince and people master and feruant bond and free ampc haue place in the kingdome of grace seeing christianity doth not abolish nature nor ciuill pollicy to which i answer that man must be considered two waies in respectof the outward or inward man consider him as he is a member in ciuill society as of the family church or commonwealth there are sundry differences of persons as bond free magistrate subiect poore rich ampc in which sense the apost exhortation taketh place wiues submit your selues to your husband coloss children obey your parents v servant be obedient to your masters v but if man be considered in respect of his spirituall estate as he is a member of the inuisible or catholique church vnder spirituall gouernement consisting in righteousnes peace of conscience and ioy in the holy ghost rom there is no distinction of calling condition or sexe for we are all on in christ gal or christ is all and in all things coloss in that though we be many yet are we but one body in christ rom seeing we are quickned with one spirit ephesians the popish opinion therefore which teacheth that there be some outward callings and actions which commend vs to god as to lead a single life to fast to vow voluntary pouerty to performe regular obedience to professe monkery to be buried in a friers cowle or to abstaine from these and these meates is here condemned when paul saith that outward priuiledges will not serue the turne and that meate commendeth vs not to god corinthian againe neither this nor the like places gal column do any thing fauour the anabaptisticall fancy of bringing in an anarchie that is an ataxy into christian society by taking away christian magistrates and distinction between masster and servant for by the same reyson we may consound the sexe of man and woman for paul saith there is neither male nor femalle but we are all on in christ the meaning thereof is this that although in respect of our inward or spirituall estate before god there be no such difference yet that hindreth not but there may be in respect of our outward estate further we learne from hence that no man is to thinke highly of himselfe in regard of outward priuiledges as birth honour welth fauour nor to glory in them ier rich man must not be high minded tim nay the king may not lift vp his mind aboue his brother deut pauls example is notable who accounted all the priuiledges which he had before his conuersion whilst he was a iew as that he was a citizen of rome a pharise a great rabbin instructed by gamaliel of the tribe of beniamin circum cised the day ampc and after his conuersion beeing a christian as that he was an apostle taken vp into the heauen ampc to be as nothing or worse then nothing euen as losse or dunge in respect of beeing a new creature in christ that is in respect of iustification and sanctification and therefore we may not set our minds to much vpon outward things as riches honours pleasures seeing they are not ylable to saluation besids this teacheth all those that are but in meane and base estate to be content for outward priuiledges auaile nothing outward wants and miseries hinder nothing if a man be rich he is nothing the ne rer and if he be poore he is not a whitt the further off it is the pouerty of the spirit which makes a man rich in grace for though the poore man be the rich mans flaue yet he is the son of god and sellow heyre with christ and though the rich man be the poore mans master yet he is the servant of christ as paul saith he that is called beeing a servant is god free man and he that is called beeing free is christ servant corinthian lastly this crosseth the opinion of the multitude who think that if a man be increased in riches graced with fauour aduanced with honour that he is a godly wise religious man and that religion which he professeth is the truth this is nothing els but to haue the faith of our lord iesus christ in respect of persons iam the second conclusion is that the new creature is the onely thing that is acceptable to god circumcision ampc aileth nothing but a new creature by the new creature the apostle vnderstandeth the image of god or renouation of the whole man both in the spirits of our minds and in the affections of our hearts which is also called the new man we shall the better conceiue it by the contrarie namely by the old man which is want of knowledge in the minde and delight in ignorance want of subiection and conformitie in the will and rebellion withall want of holines in the affections and pronenes to euill the new man then is the restoring of all these defects for the vnderstanding hereof consider that there are three things in the soule the substance of the soule the faculties or powers of the soule and the qualities of these faculties now neither the substance nor faculties are lost by the fall but onely the qualities of the faculties as when an instrument is out of tune the fault is not in the substance of the instrument nor in the sound but in the disproportion or iarre in the sound therefore the qualities onely are renewed by grace these qualities or habits are either in the vnderstanding or will and affections the qualitie in the vnderstanding is knowledge coloss ye haue put on the new man which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him in the will and affections they are principally two righteousnes and holines both which are in truth and synceritie without all hypocrisie ephesians put on the new man which after god is created in righteousnes and true holines where holines and righteousnes are opposed to concupiscences and lusts of the old man truth which hath relation to both to spiritual guile and dissimulation so that each of these qualities haue two parts a want of the contrarie euill and a positiue qualitie or habit of goodnes holines respecteth god and containeth all duties of pietie contained in the first table righteousnes respects man and the creatures and compriseth all the duties enioyned in the second table truth respecteth the manner how both the former are to be practised viz with an vpright and sincere heart free from all hypocrifie and deceit these three making a perfect harmonie in all the faculties of the soule holines performing all the duties of pietie righteousnes the duties of humanitie truth seasoning both the former with sinceritie but may some say how is the new creature opposed to all externall things or said to be of any force in the kingdome of christ seeing it is not auaileable to iustifie a man before god beeing stained with manifold imperfections for answer whereof we are to know that outward things are sometime opposed to christ and his righteousnes as coloss there is neither iew nor greek circumcision nor vncircumcision ampc but christ is all and in all things sometime to faith as gal neither circumcision auaileth any thing nor vncircumcision but faith which worketh by loue sometime to the new creature or sanctification as in this place and corinthian circumcision is nothing ampc but the keeping of the commandements of god but the sense is all one for they are opposed to christ as to the matter of our iustification to faith as to the instrument apprehending it to the new creature as to the signe of them both further whereas both here and corinthian the image of god is called a new creature or as it is in the original a new creation the meaning is not that either the substance or faculties of the soule are created a new but that the worke of regeneration is wholly to be ascribed to god alone not as though we were stocks or stones without life or motion but because god doth create these new qualities in vs quickning vs when we were dead in sinne and working in vs both the will and the deede philip if regeneration then be a new creation it must needes follow that before our conuersion we were not onely dead but euen flat nothing in godlines and grace by which we see what to iudge of the semi pelagian heresie which teacheth that a man by an internum principium may dispose himselfe to will that which is truly good and that man is not starke dead in sinne but onely sicke or wounded and halfe dead as the man which fell among theeues luke or as a prisoner that is shackled and manackled who can walke of himselfe if his fetters be taken from him so we if christ loose the chaines of our sinnes haue power of our selues to mooue our selues which doctrine we know is most iniu ious to the mercie of god and most derogatorie to the merits of christ seeing it makes him in the worke of our saluation to be but causa removens prohibens which as logicians teach is but causa sine qu non which in truth is no cause at all so that they make themselues their own sauiours and christ to be but an instrument whereby they saue themselues for if he doe but remooue the impediment they without any more adoe are able to mooue and act themselues when as the conuersion of a sinner is as great a worke as the creation of heauen and earth for paul calleth it here a new creation nay here is a greater power required if i may so speake then that whereby the world was created for though an infinite power be required as well to the creating of the great world as the recreating or regenerating of the lesse world as our sauiour christ signifies mark whether is it easier to say to the sicke of the palsie thy sinnes are forgiuen thee or to say arise take vp thy bed and walke yet the holy ghost seemeth of the two to make it more difficult to create a new hart then a new world in that speaking of the creation of the world he saith it was made by the word of god by the word of the lord were the heauens made psalm or by his fingers when i consider the heauens the workes of thy fingers psalm or by his handes psalm the heauens are the workes of thy hands but the redemption of man and the conuersion of a finner is said to be wrought by the arme of god marie in her magnificat saith he hath shewed strength with his arme luke nay he was faine to set his side to it and it made him shed many a teare and sweat as it were drops of blood trickling downe to the ground luke before our conuersion we are like the drie bones ezek for as when the winde of god came vpon them bone came to bone and were ioyned with sinews and couered with flesh and had their senses restored so when the spirit of god like the fauonian winde bloweth vpon vs it reuiueth vs againe giuing vs a new life new senses a new heart new wills and affections for all old things passe away and all things become new corinthian for it openeth the eyes of our vnderstanding making vs discerne of things that differ ephesians philip it boareth a new eare of obedience in vs psalm and giueth vs a new tast not to sauour the things of the flesh but of the spirit rom further this serues to detect the naturall popery of the multitude and of our owne hearts when we perswade our selues though falsely that though we goe on in our sinnes yet that we can repent when we list when as the prophet saith o lord i know that the way of man is not in himselfe and paul saith that it is as great a worke to create a new heart as to create a new world for regeneration is a new creation corinthian augustine saith well he that will grant pardon to him that repents will not alway giue repentance to him that sinnes againe in the sense that paul calleth the image of god a new creature or the new man and corruption the old man we graunt that our religion is new and popish religion is old for as the new man is the restored image of god in which adam was first created though afterwards defaced by his owne inuentions ecclesiastes so our religion is the restored or reformed doctrine first taught by the apostles which afterward was corrupted by mens deuices albeit in tertullians sense ours is the old religion and theirs the new as the image of god is the old man and corruption the new vse if we be not changed in our liues but remyane old adams still euen the same man we were before in minding willing affecting earthly things and fashioning our selues to the guise of the world we are no new creatures though we promise and protest neuer so much we are but hypoc tes deceauing others and our selues also for where this new creature is there is a change in all the faculties and powers of soule and body the mind is not set vpon the world but mindeth heauenly things the will affections and conuersation of the whole man is in heauen philip for the spirit of regeneration is like the leauen which a woman tooke and bid in pecks of meale till all was leauened for after the same manner by a secret operation it altereth the mind will affections if any be in christ saith the apostle he is a new creature old things are passed away behold all things are become newe if therefore we be new creatures why lead we not a new life if we be changed in affection why are we not changed in conuersation but by this we may perceiue that all which are christians in profession are not christians in conuersation all that are washed with the outward element of water are not washed with the inward baptisme the lauer of regeneratio as first those that are as good fellowes that is as badde as euer they were before and make no consciece of sinne secondly such as are no more but ciuill honest man like those honest woman which raysed persecution against paul and barnabas and expelled them out of their coasts act thirdly worldly wise man which sauour of nothing but the world lastly such as haue some loue and liking of the word and are in some sort outwardly conformable thereunto hauing some legall sorrow for sinne arising from legall terror but haue no thorowe change nor renouation lastly we may not maruell if the world hate amp maligne those that are new creatures seeing they neither mind nor affect the same things for there can be no true loue where there is contrarietie of iudgements wills affections which hath beene is and wil be between those that are borne of the flesh and those that are borne of god gen v and as many as walke according to this rule peace shall be vpon them and mercy and vpon the israel of god here paul commends this glorying in the crosse of christ and studie of pietie in becomming a new creature as the onely rule of faith and manners which all teachers and heare s were to obserue and follow enforcing the keeping and obseruing of this double dutie by the fruit and benefit that comes thereby specified here by peace and mercy in the words two things are generally to be considered first the duty of walking in these words as many as walke according to this rule secondly the reason of motiue to the practize thereof in these peace shall be vpon them and mercy which is amplified by the generalitie thereof that is shall light vpon as many as walke according thereto and vpon the israel of god the dutie is that we walke according to this canon or rule the word translated walke signifieth not simply to walke but to walke warily and circumspectly as it is expounded ephesians or to walke by rule in order and measure without treading aside but making straight steps to our feete hebr pauls rule which we must walke by is faith in christ called here glorying in the crosse of christ amp repentance towards god called regeneration or the new creature which is rightly called a le of faith and manners of things to be beleeued and practised because by it all doctrines and actions are to be examined nay the scripture is therefore called canonicall because it se tes downe an exposition of this rule there beeing nothing from the first chap in gen to the last words in the apoeal which aimeth not at one of these two either repentance towars god or faith in christ here all ministers are taught what rule to follow in preaching the word or building the church of god namely faith amp repentance the doctrine of the crosse and conuersion or the new creature and all earers according to what rule to order their liues and actions for this metaphor of walking and that by a rule or line shewes that we are trauellers or pilgrimmes that this world is a strange countrey that we are to goe to another that the world is an endles labyrinth in which we shall for euer lose our selues except we be guided by this rule and here we see that there is a certen rule for the regulating of all things apertaning to faith and manners though we cannot apply it nor vse it as we should the fault is in vs not in the rule whereas paul saith as many as walke according to this rule he shews that christians haue but on onely rule which they are to follow and according to which they must frame their liues for the apostle exhortes vs that we all proceede by on rule philipp therefore the papists doe notoriously offend not only in wresting preuerting and breaking this rule but in making other new lesbian rules which they prescribe as necessarie to be followed as the rule of s francis of s dominick s austen s ierome ampc holding on mans baptisme better then another on mans profession holier then another on mans rule perfecter then another following any rule rather then christs and so diuide his sea les coate and that these sundry rules of monks are vaine and wicked it may appeare first because they agree not with this rule of paul they beeing many it but on it directing and leading to christ they leading to by paths obscuring the merit of christ and prescribing many things partly friuolous partly impious contrary to faith and good life secondly in that they agree not among themselues euery sect hauing his own proper orders and contending their owne to be better holier perfecter then the rest thirdly in that they diuide into diverse sects those that ought to be all on in christ for which cause paul calles the corinthians carnall in houlding some of paul others of apollos corinthian for how can they be spirituall who in speech action habitte and attire profession and conuersation professe nothing but shisme and dissention ierome against the luciferians saith sieubi audieris os qui dicuntur christi non a domino lesu christ sed quoquam alio nuncupari puta marcinitas valentinianos montenses campates scito non cclesiam christi sed antichristi esse synagogam that is whersoeuer thou shalt heare those that are called christians not to haue their name from our lord iesus christ but from some other as marcionites valentinians montenses campates knowe thus much that they are not the church of christ but the synagogue of antichrist nay further solitary life in leauing the society of man and sequest ing themselues from all company which is the grownd and generall practize of monkish e emites for coenobites to speake p operly are no monks as the word teacheth is against the very light of nature it selfe first because it is naturall for man to liue together nay it is the ground of the family the church and common wealth there was neuer nation so barbarous or savage but endeauoured to liue together by associating themselues in cities townes villages caues woods tents or some other way according to the custome of the countrey which generall practise of all argues the impression of nature in all secondly speach is giuen man for this end that they might conuerse together for it were little or nothing auaileable if man should liue alone and conuerse withnone thirdly sundry vertues bestowed vpon man as iustice fortitude loue and frendship should be giuen in vaine if man should liue solitary sequestred from all company fourthly mans imbecillity argues thus much for whereas all other creatures are armed by nature as the bull with hornes the boare with tuskes other with teeth fethers swiftnes ampc man is borne feeble and naked not able to prouide or defend himselfe but only by helpe of others which is an argument that he is borne to liue in ciuill society and to be holpen by others lastly man is borne to doe good to himselfe and others in some estate and calling corinthian but he that liueth alone can doe no good to others nor receiue good from them for whereas they plead for themselues that they leaue their particular callings and betake themselus to armetages that so they may renounce the world i answer that to renounce the world is not to leaue their places and callings whereunto god hath caled them but to renounce the corruption that is in the world through lust pet these and the like reasons made the philosopher to say that he which left the societie of man and betooke himselfe to a solitary life was either a god or a beast by this we may see what lesbian rules they follow and how that which they account the highest degree of perfection is in truth the depth of abomination that it hath beene the cause of much wickednes as of idlenes hypocrisie whoredome so domitry besides the cruell murthering of many poore innocents therefore let neither their hypocrisie nor the churches pretended authoritie nor the long receiued custom any thing mooue vs but that leauing them we follow the rule of paul in this place for they that walke according to it peace shall be vpon them and mercie by peace we are to vnderstand outward peace as prosperitie and good successe in all things we goe about for whatsoeuer they doe shall prosper psalm and peace with the creatures as first with the good angels colos who are ministring spirits sent forth to minister for their sakes that shal be heires of saluation ebr pitching their tents about them psalm and bearing them in their hands as the nourse her child psalm secondly with the godly the prophet saith that in the kingdome of christ the wolfe shall dwell with the lambe the leopard shall lie with the kidde ampc that is man of fierce savage and woluish natures shal be so changed by grace as that they shall liue peaceably and louingly together thirdly with the wicked their enemy partly because they seeke to liue in peace as dauid saith of himselfe i labour for peace psalm partly because god so inclines their hearts as that they are peaceable lastly with the beast of the field and all the creatures the lord promiseth to make a couenant with the wild beast and foules of the heauen in behalfe of his people that they may sleepe safely hos but the peace which is principally meant in this place is peace of conscience which passeth all vnderstanding philipp which is peace with god beeing reconciled and at one with him rom beeing iustified by faith we haue peace with god and peace with our selues which is three fold as it is opposed to a threefold dissention in man the first is when the will and affections renewed by grace are obedient to the minde enlightened by the spirit and at peace therewith opposed to the dissention that is between rebellious affections and naturall reason the second is when grace though strongly assailed giueth corruption the foile whereupon followeth the calming and quieting of the mind opposed to the combate betweene the flesh and the spirit the third is when the conscience perswaded of remission of sinnes and reconciliation with god ceaseth to accuse and terrifie and beginnes to excuse and comfort vs opposed to the conflicts that a distressed conscience hath with legall terrours and the anger of god by mercy which is the cause of this peace are vnderstood all spirituall blessings which flow vnto vs from the loue and fauour of god in christ as remission of sinnes iustification sanctification and eternall life it selfe the words vpon them haue great emphasis signifying that these blessings come downe from heauen and light vpon them that follow this rule and that they cannot he hindered by the mallice of man let the pope then anathematize curse and excommunicate vs both prince and people because we tread not in the steps of his faith but of the faith of our father abraham and walke not according to his rule but according to this rule of the apostle for we need not feare his thunderbolts nor curses seeing the causelesse curse shall neuer come pro for what though he curse if god doe blesse it was the thing that comforted dauid beeing cursed of his enemy in that though they did curse yet god would blesse psalm and let vs comfort our selues in this that he will curse them that curse his people gen againe if peace and mercy shall be vpon them that walke according to this rule then wrath and indignation shall light vpon those that follow any other rule or deuise any other way or set downe any other meanes of saluation besides or contrary to this false therefore is the opinion of pucksius that if a man lead an outward ciuil life he may be saued in any religion the iewe in his iudaisme the turke in his mahometisme the heathen in his paganisme for they that walke not in this way according to this rule doe but weary themselues in endlesse labyrinths and so walking without line or rule in their crooked wayes shall be led with workers of iniquitie whenas peace shall be vpon israel psalm other vses are made of mercy and peace pag and to which places i referre the reader the apostle addeth that peace and mercy shal be vpon all them that walke according to this rule and vpon the israel of god there is a doble israell mentioned by paul israell according to the flesh corinthian and the israell of god as there is a twofold iewe one outward in the flesh another inward in the spirit rom by the israell of god the apostle meaneth all such as are like to nathaniell who was a true israelite in whome there was no guile ioh whether they be the faithfull gentiles or beleeuing iewes and he makes mention of the israell of god partly by reason of the aduersaries who bragged so much of their father abraham and that they were the only true israelites and yet were noe israelites because they troade not in the steps of the faith of abraham partly for the weake conuerts who thought it a hard thing to be seuered from the society of those to whome the promises were made partly for vs gentiles that we might know that all are not israell which are of israell rom but that all they which are of faith are blessed with faithfull abraham gal seeing that god is no accepter of persons act v from hence forth let no man put me to busines for i beare in my body the markes of the lord iesus here the apostle laies downe his last admonition preuenting an obiection that might be made by the false apostles or the galatians for whereas it might be said that paul sought himselfe and the world shunned persecution and therefore ioyned circumcision to christ to please the iewes and followed not his owne rule v he takes away this obiection with great authoritie when he saith from hence forth let no man put me to busines and withall he addes a reason of it for i beare in my bodie the markes of the lord iesus as if he should saie the bonds the imprisonments the stripes wounds and scarres in my bodie doe sufficiently testifie my fidelitie in my ministerie for if i had preached circumcision i should not haue suffered persecution the words may be and are taken in a doble sense first thus the false apost and you galatians by their instigation haue beene troblesome vnto me by false accusations and scanderous imputations as that i taught circumcision and the obseruatio of the ceremoniall lawe as a thing necessarie to saluation and so you haue made a reuolt from my doctrine amp by that meanes haue dobled and tripled my labour and paines among you but from hence forth cease to be troblesome vnto me you may take experiment and proofe from me the marks that i beare in my body doe sufficiently witnesse and seale the truth of my doctrine and my fidelitie in myne apostleship as also whose disciple i am moses or christs and what rule i follow iudaisme or christianisme secondly they cary this sense i haue sayd that they which walke according to this rule in glorying onely in the crosse of christ peace shall be vpon them and mercy and vpon the israel of god and i say againe and againe that we ought to striue and contend for it to obserue amp keepe it as a thing most necessarie to saluation as for othings not necessary to saluation as circumcision ampc let no man troble me in the execution of mine apostolicall function or hinder the course of the gospell by vrging any other doctrine or ceremony contrary or diverse from this as necessary to saluation this one thing is necessarie other things are needles and fruitles in comparison therefore neither i nor the church of god ought to be trobled with them this latter sense i take to be more ageeable to the text some make the sense to be this i haue had many trobles and conflicts and haue many markes and scarres in my body inflicted by persecutours therfore be no more troblesome vnto me for it were to much to add wormewood to my gale affliction to affliction here we se the condition of the apostle and the estate of all faithfull ministers that it is full of troble and molestations for as they are accounted man of turbulent spirits disquieters of the state as elijah was king and ieremie chap and paul act amp so they are most trobled with factious opposers and false teachers who labour to bring into the church things partly needles and superfluous partly hurtfull amp pernicious thus the false apost trobled the pastors and church of galatia gal and the churches of antioch syria cilicia act secondly consider how that the most and greatest trobles of the church haue beene for matter not of substance but of circumstance partly not necessarie partly contrarie to the rule which notwithstanding haue bee vrged with fire and fagot as things most necessarie lastly he that stands forth for the defence of god truth as paul did and all ministers ought to doe must let goe all circumstances and looke to the substance not with martha to trouble himselfe about many needelesse things when as one thing onely is necessarie the reason followeth in these words for i beare in my bodie the markes of the lord iesus the word in the originall translated markes doth properly signifie prints with a hot iron but it is here vsed generally to signifie any blemish skarre or marke whatsoeuer whether such as was wont to be set vpon servant bought with money which among the iewes was a hole in the eare pearced with a naule exod deut or vpon slaues taken in the war as the samians set vpon an athenian captiue the signe of an owle and the athenians vpon a samian the signe of a shippe or vpon malefactours as a hole in the eare an f in the forehead a brand in the hand or such a marke as some thinke was set vpon cain gen or the marke of god ezek or of the beast apocrypha the markes of christ are of two sorts either inward and inuisible or outward and visible the inuisible markes are two the first is god eternall election which is called god seale or marke tim the foundation of god remaineth sure and hath this seale the lord knoweth who are his all the elect are marked with this marke apocrypha and by it christ knoweth and acknowledgeth them for his sheepe ioh the second is regeneration or the imprinting of the defaced image of god in the soule by this marke which is the true indel ble character neuer to be blotted out are all beleeuers sealed corinthian ephesians these inward inuisible markes of election and regeneration are in the soule and therefore not here meant for he speakes of bodily markes i beare in my bodie the markes the outward visible marks are twofold typicall or reall typicall as circumcision which was a marke set in the foreskin of the flesh rom the blood of the paschal lambe wherewith the houses of the israelites were marked when the first borne of the aegyptians were slaine by the destroying angel and baptisme is of the same kind for by baptisme christians are distinguished from iewes turkes infidells whatsoeuer reall markes of christ are either in his naturall or in his mysticall bodie in his naturall bodie the wounds which were giuen him in his hands feete and sides which he shewed to his disciples after his resurrection ioh which whether they be now to be seene in his glorified bodie as some affirme or abolished as others i leaue to the reader as a thing vncerten and meerely coniecturall seeing there is nothing in scripture either for it or against it that doth necessarily conclude it but of these markes the apostle speaketh not in this place the markes in his mysticall bodie are those which are in his members as wounds skarres whippings maimednes ampc of which we read corinthian euery where we beare about in our bodie the dying of the lord iesus and corinthian fiue times receiued i fourtie stripes saue one i was thrise beaten with roddes once stoned ampc and these the apostle here calleth the marks of christ because they are inflicted for the profession of christ and the gospel as the wounds and skarres of a souldier may be called his princes woundes and skarres because they are had in his cause and quarrell now those in his naturall bodie differ from these in his mysticall first in that they are meritorious for by his stripes we are healed pet these in his mysticall body are glorious in the sight of god as the death of his saints is yet not meritorious secondly those in his naturall bodie were prophecied of before in particular psalm they pearced my hands and my feete these in his mysticall bodie onely in generall that we should be conformable vnto him in this place paul speaketh of the latter onely which were in his owne person and this he doth not to put any merit in the as s francis did but to testifie himself to be a faithfull servant of christ and he further meeteth with the false apostles who would needes haue had the galatians circumcised that so they might glorie in the flesh as hauing se the marke of circumcision in the foreskin of their flesh as if he should say i set not markes in other mens flesh to glorie of them as the false apostles doe but i beare about in my bodie the markes of the lord iesus these are the signes of mine apostleship and arguments of fidelitie in my ministerie which i set not in other mens flesh but haue in mine owne here we see what we are to thinke and what vse we are to make of the wounds ska res and blemishes that are in any of the saints for the profession of the gospel and maintenance of the truth first that they are the sufferings wounds and marks of christ himselfe as paul tearmeth them here and coloss seeing they are the wounds of the members of that bodie wherof he is the head secondly they haue this vse to conuince the consciences of persecutors and wicked man that they are the servant of christ which suffer thus for righteousnes sake for which cause they are here mentioned by paul thus he prooues himselfe to be a member of christ by the afflictions which he suffered for his sake corinthian thirdly if man be constant in their profession namely in faith and obedience they are banners of victorie therefore no man ought to be ashamed of them no more then souldiers of their wounds and skarres but rather in a holy manner to glorie of them as paul did for as it is a glorie to a souldier to haue receiued many wounds and to haue many skarres in a good cause in his princes quarrell and for the desence of his countrey so it is a glorie for a christian souldier to haue the markes of the lord iesus in his bodie as of wounds scourges bonds imprisonment for the profession of the truth therfore constantine the great as the ecclesiasticall historie records kissed the holes of the eyes of certaine bishops which had them put out by the arrians for the constant profession of the faith of christ reuerencing the vertue of the holy ghost which shined in them this makes nothing for the fratres flagellantes who glorie in the markes which they make in their flesh by whipping of themselues for first it is not the punishment as cyprian saith but the cause that makes a martyr secondly the marks which man set vpon themselues contrarie to the law leuit are not the markes of the lord iesus but those onely which are set vpon them by others for the profession of the truth thirdly this whipping and afflicting of themselues beeing but willworship in not sparing of the bodie coloss is no better accepted of god the the superstitious practise of baals priests lancing themselues with kniues till the blood gushed out king againe if this be the glorie of a servant of christ and a note of constant profession what shall we say of them who haue not onely their consciences seared with a hot iron but by drink whoring rioting ampc get the markes of bacchus and venus in their body for if these be the markes of christ those must needes be the marks of satan lastly hence we are taught a speciall dutie and that is to suffer bodily affliction in the profession of the truth amp though bonds and imprisonment abide vs in all places not to passe for them so that we may fulfill our course with ioy according to pauls example both here and act as also his commandement to timothie suffer affliction as a good souldier of iesus christ tim the reasons are these first by suffering bodely affliction we are made conformable vnto christ and fulfill the rest of the afflictions of christ in our flesh coloss secondly they teach vs to haue a sympathie and fellow feeling of the miseries of our brother to remember those that are in bonds as though we were bound with them and those that are in affliction as though we also were afflicted in the bodie ebr thirdly our patient induring of affliction doth not onely serue as a president and example to others to suffer patiently but also is a notable meanes to confirme them in the truth corinthian philip lastly they serue to scoure vs that are earthly vessels from the rust and filth of sinne that cleaues so fast vnto our nature brother the grace of our lord iesus christ be with your spirit amen here the apostle concludes his epistle with his vsuall farewell commending the galatians to the grace of god amp wishing vnto them all things appertaining to spirituall life amp godlines pet which he signifieth here by grace there is a twofold grace mentioned in scripture grace which makes a man gratious or acceptable to god gratia gratum faciens and grace which is freely giuen gratia gratis data gratia gratum faciens is the fauour and loue of god whereby he is well pleased with his elect in christ and this grace is in god himselfe and noe qualitie infused or inherent in vs and it is truly called the first grace as beeing the cause of all other subsequent graces gratia gratis data is the free gift of god bestowed vpon man whether naturall or supernaturall naturall eyther in the state of innocencie before the fall as originall iustice ampc or in the state of apostasie since the fall as the gift of illumination ioh and such like supernatural eyther common gifts as the gift of miracles prophecying tongues ampc or sauing graces as the grace of election effectuall vocation iustification adoption glorification ampc all which are called the second grace because they flow from the first as the streame from the fountaine thus paul distinguisheth them rom calling the former the grace of god the latter the gift by grace nowe grace in this place is not to be restrained onely to the benefit of our redemption as it is corinthian where the grace of christ is distinguished from the loue of god and communion of the h ghost but to be vnderstood of the fauour amp loue of god which is the first grace and of the sauing grace of regeneration which is the second grace or the gift by grace and it is called the grace of our lord iesus christ first because he is the fountaine of it ioh of his fullnes all we haue receiued and grace for grace secondly because he is the conduit or pipe by which it is conuaied vnto vs ioh grace and truth came by iesus christ for he is our propitiator by whome alone we receiue grace that is the fauour of god and reconciliation for grace that is for the fauour and loue which god the father bare vnto his son we beeing accepted of god and beloued in his beloued ephesians christ is further called our lord in fiue respects first by right of creation ioh all things were made by him secondly by right of inheritance hebr he is made hoyre of all things psalm i will giue thee the heathen for thine inheritance and the endes of the earth for thy possession thirdly by right of redemption corinthian ye are bought with a price which is neither siluer nor gold but the pretious blood of christ pet and this he performed by a double right namely by right of proprietie as a king redeemes his subiects the master his servant or by right of affinitie as the father may redeeme the son one brother an other and one kinsman an other fourthly by right of conquest luke when a strong man armed keepeth his palace ampc but when a stronger then he commeth vpon him and ouercommeth him he taketh from him all his armour wherein he trusted and diuideth the spoile lastly by right of contract and marriage hos thou shalt call me ishi and shalt not call me baali and v i will marrie thee vnto me for euer in righteousnes iudgement mercy and compassion i will marrie the vnto me in faithfulnes and thou shalt know the lord the apostle proceeds and saith the grace of our lord iesus christ be with your spirits for the better vnderstanding of which phrase we are to know that man consisteth of two essentiall parts of soule and bodie ecclesiastes dust that is the bodie returnes to the earth whence it was taken and the spirit returns to god that gaue it albeit the apostle els where deuideth man into three parts spirit soule and bodie when he praieth for the thessalonians that their whole spirit and soule and body may be kept blameles vnto the comming of christ where he subdiuideth the soule into two parts into reason or vnderstanding which he calleth the spirit will or affection which he tearmeth by the common name agreeing to both the soule god hauing giuen reason to see and will to seeke after that which is good that reason hauing eyes might guide the will that is blinde and goe before that it might follow so that the spirit and soule are not two seuerall substances but one and the same euen as the bodie and the flesh are one bodie and yet are they distinguished for doctrine sake heb the word of god is said to enter through euen to the diuiding a sunder of the soule and the spirit and ephesians the apostle distinguisheth the soule into three faculties the mind cogitation heart when he saith the gentiles walked in the vanitie of their minds and had their cogitations darkened because of the hardnes of their hearts by minde meaning the hegemonicall part or vnderstanding by cogitation the inward senses as memorie phantasie ampc and by heart the affections now by spirit in this place is not ment the vnderstanding alone or the soule alone but by a synechdoche the whole man is vnderstood albeit the soule principally be ment because it is the proper subiect of grace for grace beeing a spirituall thing is placed immediately and properly in the spirit or mind of man and in the bodie accidentally where it doth bewray it selfe by outward actions secondly for that as the seate of grace is in the mind so the sense and apprehension of it is there likewise amp not in the bodie thirdly as theophilact saith non ait vobiscum quid ita abigens eos rebus hisce arguensque non lege bos spiritum sed gratia accepisse so that it is all one as if he should haue said the grace of our lord iesus christ be with you all as it is philip and thess as it may appeare by the like for that farewell which paul giues timothie in his latter epistle the lord iesus christ be with thy spirit tim is all one with that in his former grace be with thee tim and that salutation philem the grace of our lord iesus christ be with your spirit is all one with that coloss grace be with you hence that phrase and forme of speech in our english liturgie or common praier booke though misliked by some and cauilled at by others hath his warrant and ground when the minister saith the lord be with you and the people answer and with thy spirit wishing the same to him that he to them that god would be with his spirit that is with him againe marke how the apostle as he did beginne with grace chap so he doth ende with grace to teach vs first of all that our saluation is placed in it alone for the beginning the progresse and the accomplishment thereof for election is of grace rom and vocation is of grace tim and iustification rom and glorification rom secondly that christ is to haue all the glorie of this grace whereby we are so highly aduanced into the fauour of god both for the beginning continuance and ending without ascribing any part thereof to our selues or any other creature thirdly that all our salutations and greetings our adieues and fare wells ought to be grounded in the grace of christ otherwise they are but carnall and therefore the apostle biddeth the christians to salute one another in a holy kisse or as peter speakes with the kisse of loue pet this confutes the popish doctors who doe not onely ascribe the beginning of their saluation to themselues in coworking with god in their first conuersion but also the ende and accomplishment of it by workes of condignitie which as they say are meritorious of eternall life further obserue with what emphasis the apostle concludes his epistle first opposing christ the lord of the house to moses who was but a servant in the house secondly the grace of christ to inherent iustice and merits of workes thirdly the spirit in which he would haue grace to be seated to the flesh in which the apostles gloried so much lastly brotherly vnitie one with another implied in the word brother to the proud and lordly carriage of the false apostles ouer them in the ende of all it is added in the greeke and siriacke copies that this epistle was written to the galatians from rome which post script seemes to be erroneous and false for first there is not a tittle in the whole epistle that giueth the least inkling that it should haue beene written from rome whereas in all the rest which are written from thence paul makes mention of his bonds and imprisonment secondly the varietie of copies argues the vncertentie of it seeing in some copies it is said to haue been sent from ephesus as caietan and hyperius affirme in their commentaries vpon this place thirdly baronius if his authoritie be of any waight in this case affirmeth that it is not likely or credible that it was written from thence but be it graunted that this post script were true indeede yet it is no part of canonicall scripture as not beeing written by the apostle but added afterwards by the scribes which copied out the epistles neither is this onely true of post scripts but also of inscriptions or titles prefixed before epistles they are no part of holy writ this may easily be prooued in particular for first touching post scripts the greeke copies agree in this that the first epistle to the corinthians was written from philippi and sent by stephanas fortunatus achaicus and timotheus when as it is certen it was written from ephesus for first chap he saith he will come to them when he shall go through macedonia therefore paul was not then at philippi a chiefe citie in macedonia secondly in the of the same chapter he saith all the churches of asia salute you which shewes plainly that when paul writ this epistle he was at ephesus in asia not at philippi in europe thirdly v he saith he will abide at ephesus till pentecost therefore he was not then at philippi fourthly that it was written before the tumult in ephesus raised by demetrius and his complices and so consequently before his comming to philippi as also that it was sent by timotheus and erastus it is manifest v of that chapter beeing compared with act v lastly the syriacke translatour agreeth with me in affirming that it was written from ephesus and so doth baromius annal tomorrow pag l againe the post script of the to the corinthians hath it was written from philippi of macedonia and sent by titus and luke whereas the rhemists if we may giue any credit to their testimonie who elsewhere make titles part of the canonicall scripture say it was written at troas as it is thought and baron annal om pag l antuerp thinkes it was written at nicopoli vpon this occasion that in his former epistle from ephesus promising to come vnto the as he passed through macedonia amp coming not corinthian he doth in this excuse himselfe corinthian compared with the corinthian neither is it a good reason to prooue that titus carried this epistle as it is in the postscript because paul saith he sent titus to them and another with him corinthian and for paul speakes of titus his comming vnto the before that time neither may it be thought that t tus was sent the second time vnto them considering that departing from macedonia and taking titus with him he left him in creete see cesar baron annal tomorrow antuerp p l besides the rhemists controll the subscription of the first epistle to the thessalonians which hath it thus the first epistle to the thessalonians written from athens for in their preface they are bold to affirme that it seemeth rather to haue bin written at corinthian then at athens and they giue this reason of it because after the sending of timothie to thessalonica paul and he meete not at athens againe but at corinthian and baronius affirmeth that it seemes to haue beene written presently after that sylas and timotheus came to him to corinthian out of macedonia by comparing act with thess annal tomorrow pag l and emman i sa doth censure the syriacke postscript which saith it was sent from athens by timothie seeing that timothie was then absent the like they affirme in the argument of the second epistle for albeit the greeke postscript hath it that it was written from athens yet they rather thinke it was written from corinthian where paul aboad a yeare and sixe moneths act because the title is like vnto the first epistle paul and sylvanus and timotheus ampc and baronius saith that it should be written from athens impossibile est affirmare because it was written soone after the former as may appeare by the inscription paul and sylvanus and timotheus they continuing together but the former was written from corinthian as hath bin prooued and therefore the latter specially considering that paul went thence from athens and aboad at corinthian a yeare and a halfe and returned not backe againe to athens but went to ephesus annal tomorrow pag l adde hereunto that whereas the postscript of the to timothie saith it was written from l odicea the chiefe citie of phrigia pacaciana the rhemists notwithstanding in the argumen affirme that it is vncerten where it was written amp though it be commonly said to haue beene written at l odicca yet it seemeth to be otherwise because it is like he was neuer there as may be gathered by the epistle to the colossians which was written at rome in his last trouble a little before his death for coloss paul seemes to insinuate that he was neuer at that laodicea of phrigia neare to colossos and hierapolis and that they neuer saw his person besides neither pl nie who writ after paul nor any other ancient classique author doth make mention of phrigia pacaciana so that it seemeth to haue beene so called long after pauls discease the first mention that is made of it as some haue obserued beeing in the acts of the synode of constantinople baronius is of opinion that it was written from macedonia tomorrow pag grounding his coniecture vpon tim as i besought thee to abide at ephesus when i went into macedonia so doe the same doth athanasius affirme in his synopsis and theodoret in his preface vpon that epistle againe the subscription of the to timothie that it was written from rome vnto timothie the first bishop elected of the church of ephesus cannot well stand as some thinke with that of s paul timothie doe the worke of an euang list seeing that euangelists were not tied to personall residencie to abide in one place as bishops and pasters are but were to goe from place to place to confirme the churches planted by the apostles but the discussing of this argument whether timothie were an euangelist properly so called and whether the same man could not be an euangelist and a bishop requireth a longer discourse then can be affoarded to this short treatise lastly the postscript of the epistle to t tus saith it was written from nicopolis of macedonia the deuisers of which assertion ground their opinion vpon titus where paul saith be iligent to come to me to nicopolis for i haue determined there to winter mistaking the text for he saith not be diligent to come to me to nicopolis for i haue determined here to winter as beeing there alreadie but i haue determined there to winter by which it is plaine that when paul wrote to titus he was not at nicopolis as the postscript affirmeth and so we see the text which they alleadge for them maketh most against them and this is the iudgement amp reason of baronius annal tomorrow pag l antuerp howsoeuer claudius espencaus shifts his fingers of it and passes it ouer in silence thus much concerning subscriptions a word or two touching inscriptions or titles prefixed before epistles that these be no part of scripture written by the apostles but added to the epistles by some others it may appeare by these reasons first generally if titles were canonicall as well as the epistles themselues the fathers would neuer haue doubted as they did whether paul were the author of the epistle to the ebrewes or not seeing in all copies saue one as beza hath obserued it beareth his name but some of them ascribe it to barnabas as tertullian others to luke as jerome witnesseth others to clement oecumenius infitleth it only thus the epistle to the ebrewes without adding the name of paul or any other as the penner of it and so hentenius a papist doth translate it out of occumenius secondly some epistles as those seuen written by iames peter john iude haue vnfit titles prefixed before them in that they are called sometime canonicall specially of the latine church and sometime catholick chiefly of the greek church neither of which were euer giuen them by any apostle or apostolique writer for first touching the title canonicall it may seeme strange that this inscription should euer haue been appropriated vnto them which is common with them to the whole word of god as though in them were contained a more perfect and absolute rule of doctrine and manners of things to be beleeued and practised then in the other bookes of holy writ considering that sundrie diuines albeit erroniously i confesse haue beene so farre from giuing vnto them this preheminence aboue the rest of the bookes of scripture that they haue altogether reiected them as no part of canonicall scripture by name the epistle of iames the of peter the and of john and that of iude of all which it was doubted in auncient time as we see in eusebius and the syrian church receiueth them not to this day as beeing not in the syriacke translation and caietan a popish writer and the lutherans at this present reiect them as may appeare by their writings secondly that this inscription was added to these epistles without sufficient ground and warrant of reason may appeare in that no reason can be giuen why these seuen should be called canonicall rather then the epistles of s paul or that to the ebrewes whosoeuer was the penner thereof for whereas the ordinarie glosse saith they are called canonicall because they were receiued into the canon with the other epistles by that reason they should be no more canonicall then the rest nay not of that authenticall at least of that vndoubted authoritie the rest are of seeing they hardly obtained to be registred in the canon with the rest as canonicall lastly this title was neuer giuen to these epistles by the greek church which was more auncient but onely by the latin church as might be prooued by manifold testimonies if it were a thing necessarie to be stood vpon neuerthelesse howsoeur this inscription cannot be defended yet it may be excused and tollerated as a title of distinction to distinguish them from the other epistles as we see the iewes diuiding the olde testament into parts the first they called the law or bookes of moses the the former prophets viz ioshua judges bookes of samuel bookes of the kings the the later prophets as esay ieremie ezechiel and the small prophets the they called kethubim which in english is as much as the scriptures not as though those bookes were more properly scripture then the pentateuch of moses or the bookes of the former and later prophets but onely for distinction sake they were so called and they are tearmed of the and of the greeke church that is holy writts not because they had a peculiar holines proper to them aboue other parts of god word seeing all scripture is equally giuen by diuine inspiration nor as though the amanuenses of these bookes were more holy then the other pen man of the holy ghost nay contrarily it is doubted by some of salomon who penned three of these bookes whether he were elected or reiected whereas it is not doubted of the rest but onely as i haue alreadie said to put a note of distinction between them and other bookes in naming of them as to p not elucid c quia nullam habent specialem proprietatem qu distinguantur caeteris commune nomen quasi proprium obtinent hugo de s uict hath well obserued in this sense this title canonicall may be giuen to these epistles without danger but if we shall vnderstand it in any other sense we shall be so farre from beeing able to defend it that we shall not be able to excuse it the second title which is giuen them is that they be called catholike which inscription is as vnfit as the former for they are so called as some would haue it because they were writte and directed to the whole catholike church consisting both of iewes and gentiles but that is not true seeing iames chap directeth his epistle onely to the tribes that were dispersed and not to the gentiles and peter who was an apostle of circumcision epistle writeth onely to the strangers the iewes that dwell here and there throughout pontus galatia cappadocia asia and bythinia others thinke they are tearmed catholike for that they were not sent to one man or familie or citie or countrey but generally to the whole bodie company and societie of the iewes wheresoeuer dispersed ouer the whole earth but neither in this sense can they fitly or truly be tearmed catholike forasmuch as two of these seuen viz the second and third of john were written to particular persons the one to the elect ladie the other to gains and by this reason the epistle to timothie that to titus and philemon may be called catholike as well as these againe be it graunted that they were all directed to all the iewes yet i see not why the epistle to the ebrewes may not as well chalenge this title to be called catholike as any of these seuen considering it was written to all the iewes and onely to the iewes thirdly others affirme them to be called catholike because they containe catholike doctrine such as appertaineth to all man generally of what estate place condition or calling so euer they be but in this sense all pauls epistles may be called catholike epistles for whatsoeuer is written is written for our learning that we through patience and consolation of the scriptures might haue hope rom secondly the word catholike is not so ancient for pacianus an auncient father saith it was not vsed in the apostles daies his wordes are these sed sub apostolis enquies nemo catholicus vocabatur esto sic fuerie vel illud indulge cum post apostolos haereses extitissent diuersisque nominibus columbam dei atque reginam lacerare per partes amp sciudere niterentur nonne cognomen suum pleb apostolica p stulabat quo incorrupti populi distingueret vnitatem ne intemeratam dei virginem error aliquorum per membra laceraret that is but thou wilt say vnder the apostles no man was called catholique well be it so yet admit this withall when after the apostles there were heresies and man beganne to rend in peeces and diuide god done and queene by sundry different names did not the apostolike people require their surnames whereby they might distinguish the vnitie of the vncorrupt people least the error of some should rend in sunder god vndefiled virgin where we see pacianus doth freely grant that this surname catholike was not in vse in the time of the apostles which testimonie baronius doth notably dissemble in shewing the originall of this name out of pacianus affirming but not proouing it to be as ancient as the apostles now this errour hath not onely befallen the latin and greeke copies but the syriacke likewise as may appeare in the title prefixed before the most ancient syrian traslation where we shal find these words the epistles of the apostles before whose eyes our lord was transfigured iames peter john in which inscription be couched soule errours first in that this translator maketh but epistles of james peter and john whereas there are sixe he omitting the of peter the and of john as also that of iude as no part of holy scripture amp therfore the syriack church as i haue alreadie said doth not receiue these epistles into their canon vnto this day the second is in that he affirmeth iames before whom our s christ was transfigured in mount tabor to be the author of this epistle for that iames before whome christ was transfigured in the mount was iames the son of zebedeus and brother of john matth after sixe daies iesus tooke peter and iames and john his brother and brought them vp into an high mountain and was transfigured before them which iames could not possibly be the penner of this epistle for he was slaine by king herode long before the destruction of ierusalem and the dispersion of the tribes acts v about that time herode the kinge stretched forth his hand to vexe certaine of the church and he slew iames the brother of john with the sword therfore iames the author of this epistile was iames the son of alphaeus for to faine an other iames the brother of our lord as some haue done is childish seeing it is plaine by sundry places of the n t that there were but two of that name mentioned in scripture iames the son of zebedeus called iames the greater and iames the son of alphoeus brother to iude called the less and brother of our lord

the arte or facultie of prophecying is a sacred doctrine of exercising prophecie rightly prophecie or prophecying is a publique and solemne speech of the prophet pertaining to the worship of god and to the saluation of our neighbour corinthian but he that prophecieth speaketh vnto man to edification to exhortation and to consolation verse but if all prophecie and there come in one that beleeueth not or one vnlearned he is rebuked of all man and is iudged of all man rom god is my witnes whom i serue or worship in my spirit in the gospell of his son of the preaching of the word there are two parts of prophecie preaching of the word and conceiuing of prayers for in speaking there are onely two duties of the prophet that is of the minister of the word to wit preaching of the word and praying vnto god in the name of the people rom hauing prophecie let vs prophecie according to the proportion of faith gen deliuer the man his wife againe for he is a prophet and when he shall pray for thee thou shalt liue for this cause the word prophecie is giuen also to prayers chronicle the sonnes of asaph and heman and ieduthun who were singers prophecied with harpes with uials and with cymbals king the prophets of baal called vpon the name of baal from morning to noone and when mid day was passed and they had prophecied vntill the offer of the euening sacrifice and euery prophet is partly the voyce of god to wit in preaching and partlie the voyce of the people in the acte of praying ier if thou take away the precious fro the vile thou shalt be as it were my mouth nehe and hezra blessed the lord the great god and all the people answered amen preaching of the word is prophecying in the name and roome of christ whereby man are called to the state of grace and conserued in it corinthian and hath committed to vs the word of reconciliation therefore wee are embassadours for christ as though god did beg you by vs we pray you in the name of christ that ye be reconciled to god thes god hath from the beginning elected you to saluation through sanstification of the spirit and faith embracing the trueth whereunto he called you by our gospell rom the gospel is the power of god to saluation to euery one that beleeueth prou when there is no vision the people are naked rom of the word of god the perfect and equall or the word of god is the whole and onely matter about which preaching is exercised it is the field in which the preacher must containe himselfe obiect of preaching is the word of god lok they haue moses and the prophets let them heare them mat the scribes and pharises sit in moses chaire that is they teach the doctrine of moses which they doe professe all therefore whatsoeuer they bid you obserue that obserue and doe the word of god is the wisedome of god concerning the trueth which is according vnto godlinesse descending from aboue iam but the wisedome which is from aboue is first pure ampc tit paul a servant of godaccording to the acknowledging of the trueth which is according vnto godlines admirable is the excellencie of the word which is euident partly by the nature thereof partly by the operation the excellencie of the nature is either the perfection thereof or the eternitie the perfection is either the sufficiencie or the puritie the sufficiencie is that whereby the word of god is so compleat that nothing may be either put to it or taken from it which appertaineth to the proper end thereof psalm the law of the lord is perfect conuerting the soule deut whatsoeuer i commaund you take heede yee doe it thou shalt put nothing thereto nor take ought therefrom revelation the puritie thereof is whereby it remaineth entire in it selfe voide of deceit and errour psalm the words of the lord are pure words as siluer tried in a furnace of earth fined seuen times the eternity of the word is that whereby it abideth inuiolable and cannot passe vntill all that which it commandeth bee fully accomplished matth the excellencie of operation is that wherby it is endowed with virtue first to discerne the spirit of man heb for the word of god is liuely and mightie in operation and sharper then any two edged sword and entreth through euen to the deuiding asunder of the soule and spirit and of the ioynts and the marrow aad discerneth the thoughts and intents of the heart secondly to bind the conscience iam there is one law giuer who is able to saue and to destroy isaiah the lord is our iudge the lord is our law giuer the lord is our king he will saue vs to bind the conscience is to constraine it either to accuse vs or to excuse vs of sinne before god the word is in the holy scripture the scripture is the word of god written in a language fit for the church by man immediately called to be the clerks or secretaries of the holy ghost pet for prophecie came not in old time by the will of man but the holy man of god spake as they were carried and mooued by the holy ghost it is called canonicall because it is as it were a canon that is to say a rule or line of the master workman by the helpe whereof the truth is both first to be found out and also afterwards to be examined gal and as many as walke according to this canon or rule therefore the supreame and absolute determination and iudgement of the controuersies of the church ought to be giuen vnto it the summe of the scripture is conteined in such a syllogisme or forme of reasoning as this is which followeth the major or proposition the true messias shall be both god and man of the seede of dauid he shall be borne of a uirgin he shall bring the gospell forth of his fathers bosome he shall satisfie the law he shall offer vp himselfe a sacrifice for the sinnes of the faithfull he shall conquer death by dying and rising againe he shall ascend into heauen and in his due time hee shall returne vnto iudgement but the minor or assumption iesus of nazaret the son of mary is such a one he the conclusion therefore is the true messias in this syllogisme the major is the scope or principall drift in all the writings of the prophets and the minor in the writings of the euangelists and apostles the scripture is either the new testament or the old the old testament is y first part of the scripture written by the prophets in the hebrew tongue or at least in the chaldie vnfolding chiefely that old couenant of works luke and and he began at moses and at all the prophets and interpreted vnto them in all the scriptures the things which were written of him it is distinguished by bookes which are either historicall or dogmaticall or propheticall the historicall bookes are stories of things done for the illustration and confirmation of that doctrine which is propounded in other bookes corinthian now al these things came vpo them for ensamples and were written to admonish vs rom for whatsoeuer things were written afore time are written for our learning these books are in number fifteene genesis which is an historie of the creation fall promise and of the state of the church conserued and shut vp in priuate families exodus which is an historie of the deliuerance of the israelites from the aegyptians of their going out of egypt of the promulgation of the law and of the tabernacle leuiticus which containeth a storie of the ceremoniall worship numbers which is an historie of their martiall marching into the land of canaan deuteronomie which is a commentarie repeating and explicating the lawes out of the fore said bookes the booke of ioshua which declareth their entrance into and possession of the land of canaan vnder ioshua the book of the iudges which comprehendeth an historie of the corrupt and miserable condition of the church and common wealth of israel from ioshua to eli the booke of ruth which is an historie concerning the mariages and posteritie of ruth the first and second booke of samuel which is a storie of things done vnder eli and samuel priests and vnder saul and dauid kings the first and second booke of kings which maketh a narratio of things atchieued in the daies of the kings of israel and iudah the first and second booke of chronicles which is a methodicall historie of the beginning increase and ruine of the people of israel seruing to explaine and shew the line or linage of christ the booke of ezra which containeth an historie of their returne from captiuitie in babylon and of the beginning of the restoring of the citie the booke of nehemiah which speaketh of the restoring of the city which was to be finished the booke of hester which is an historie of the preseruation of the church of the iewes in persia by hester the booke of iob which is an history intreating of the causes of tentations as also of his manifold conflicts and lastly of his happie issue the dogmaticall bookes are those which teach and prescribe the doctrine of diuinitie these are foure in number the booke of psalmes which containeth sacred songes to be fitted for euerie condition both of the church and the particular members therof and also to be sung with grace in the heart column the booke of prouerbes which is a treatise of christian manners teaching pietie towards god and iustice towards our neighbour the eeclesiastes booke of the preacher which discloseth the vanity of al humane things so farre forth as they are vsed without the feare of god the the booke of canticles song of songs which speaketh of the mutuall communion of christ with the church vnder an allegorie of a or husband and spouse bridegroome and his bride the prophetical books are predictions either of the iudgements of god for the sinnes of the people or of the deliuerance of the church which is to bee perfited at the comming of christ but with these predictions that is the prophets they doe mingle the doctrine of repentance and doe almost alwaies vse consolations in christ to them that doe repent it is their custome also for the helping of their hearers memorie and vnderstanding to propound their sermons brieflie which they made at large isaiah moreouer the lord said vnto me take thee a great roule and write in it with a mans penne hab write the vision and make it plaine vpon tables that he may run that readeth it prophecies are either greater or less greater are such as do more plentifullie deliuer all those things that are foretold as the prophecie of esay ieremie ezekiel daniel hitherto belong the lamentations of ieremie touching the miserie of the people of the iewes about the time of the death of iosiah less prophecies are those which intreate more sparinglie or briefely of all those things that are foretold or at least of some of them as the prophecie of hosea ioel amos obediah ionas michah nahum habakuk zephanie hagge zachary malachie thus much for the old testament the new testament is the second part of the scripture written in the greeke tongue by the apostles or at least approued of them propounding plainely the doctrine of the new couenant ephesians and are built vpon the foundation of the prophets and apostles peter approued the gospel of marke at whose motion and appointment it was written by marke as it pleaseth nicephorus to auerre lib cap and john that wrote the gospell approued the gospell of luke it is of small moment which is reported by eusebius to wit that it is apparent by two places tim and rom that paul was the author of that gospell which is called lukes for paul doth not here speake of any one booke but of his whole ministerie for hee addeth in which i suffer trouble as an euill doer euen vnto bonds tim the new testament containeth partly history and partly epistles the history are the foure gospels of matthew marke luke and john which are an history of the life deedes and doctrine of christ exhibited vnto the world continuing from his conception euen vntill his ascension into heauen and there are foure writers two that were hearers and two that were eye witnesses that they might giue greater assurance of the truth of the historie the difference between the euangelists is on this wise matthew layeth open the doctrines which christ deliuered marke sets downe the historie briefly yet did he not make an abridgement of the gospell which matthew wrote as hierome supposed for hee begins his discourse in a diverse manner and proceedes in another order partly intreating of things more largely and partlie interlacing of new matters luke aimeth at or frameth a perfect historie and described in a certaine order john is almost wholy taken vp in laying open the godhead and benefit of christ which is deriued from his godhead vnto vs hierome distinguisheth the euangelists by their beginnings or entrance he saith matthew is like a man because hee begins with the man hood of christ he likens marke to a lion because hee begins with the preaching of john which was like the roaring of a lion he compares luke to an oxe because he beginneth with zachary the priest offer his sacrifice he compareth john to an eagle because he doth as it were so are vp aloft and begin with the godhead of christ the acts of the apostles which is an orderly historie specially relating the deeds of peter and paul that there might be an ensample of gouerning the church extant tim the reuelation which is a propheticall historie concerning the condition of the church from the age in which john the apostle liued vnto the ende of the world the epistles follow thirteene epistles of paul the epistle to the hebrewes concerning the person and offices of christ and of faith bringing foorth fruit in good workes the epistle of iames concerning works to be ioyned with faith the first and second epistle of peter touching sanctification and the works of new obedience the first epistle of john concerning the signes of fellowship with god the second epistle of john to the elect ladie about perseuerance in the truth the third epistle of john to gayus concerning hospitalitie and constancie in that which is good the epistle of iude of constancie in the faith against false prophets and thus the canonicall scripture is distinguished by her bookes now there are verie strong proofes which shew that she alone is the word of god and no other besides of these proofes one doth make a man certainelie to probatio amp know the same the other doth but declare or testifie it of the former kind there is onelie one namely the inward testimony of the holy ghost speaking in the scriptures and not only telling a man within in his heart but also effectually perswading him that these bookes of the scripture are the word of god isai my spirit that is vpon thee and my words which i haue put in thy mouth shall not depart out of thy mouthfrom henceforth euen for euer the manner of perswading is on this wise the eelect hauing the spirit of god doe first discerne the voyce of christ speaking in the scriptures moreouer that voyce which they doe discerne they doe approoue and that which they doe approue they doe beleeue lastly beleeuing they are as it were sealed with the seale of the spirit ephe wherein also after that ye beleeued yee were sealed with the holy spirit of promise the church also may beare witnesse of the canon perswade she cannot for by this meanes the voyce of the church should be of greater force then the voyce of god and the whole state of mans saluation should depend vpon man than which what can be said to be more miserable obiect the scripture is the word of god by it selfe but it is not so to vs but by the iudgement of the church ans the distinction is vaine for the first part thereof sheweth the manner whereby the scripture is the word of god the latter part sheweth not the manner how but the person to whom the scripture doth also testifie the same thing with that kind of testimonie which is surer euen then all the oathes of man for we haue the voyce of the holy ghost speaking in the scripture who doth also worke in our hearts a certaine full perswasion of the scriptures when we are exercised in hearing reading and meditating of the neither doe we beleeue a thing because the church saith it is to beleeued but therefore we doe beleeue a thing because that which the church speaketh the scripture did first speake yes the church cannot stand nor yet be imagined without faith faith is not without the word which word is the rule or obiect of faith and not the iudgement though it be of most holy man he which doubteth of the scriptures will doubt as well of the testimonie of the church obiect the church hath a iudgement to determine of matters act it seemeth good to the holy ghost and to vs ans the soueraigne or supreame iudgement concerning matters of faith belongeth to the holy ghost speaking in the scriptures the ministerie of iudgement or a ministeriall iudgement is only giuen vnto the church because she must iudge according to the scriptures and because she doth not this alwaies but sometimes faileth the apostles were present at that councell which was held at ierusalem who were man that had authoritie which was of it selfe to be beleeued which authoritie the ecclesiasticall ministery now hath not the proofe of declaration or testification is that which doth not demonstrate or perswade but only testifie and by certaine tokens approue the true canon this proofe is manifold first the perpetuall consent of the church of the ancient church of the iewes rom for chieflie because vnto them were of credit committed the oracles of god and of the new and latter church from christ and the apostles who cited testimonies foorth of those bookes from the fathers first origin as eusebius testifieth lib amp melito as the same eusebius witnesseth lib athanasius cyril sermon cyprian or rather ruffine in his exposition of the creed in his preface vpon the

who were about the yeare of the worlds creation three thousand and fiue hundreth fourthly the most certaine accomplishment of the prophecies as are these of the calling of the gentiles of antichrist of the apostasie of the iewes ampc fiftly the matter thereof which is of one true god of the true worship of god and that god is the sauiour sixtly the consent of all the parts of the scripture seauenthly the miraculous preseruation of the scriptures in the perils of the church and in the time of generall reuolting eightly the operation thereof for it conuerteth man and though it bee flatlie contrarie to the reason and affections of man yet it winneth them vnto it selfe ninthly it is full of maiestie in the simplenes of the words lastly the holy penmen set downe their owne corruptions and moses commendeth himselfe saying that he was the meekest of all man which argueth that they were led by the holie ghost and christ who is described in the gospell affirmeth very plainely that he is the son of god and that he is one with god the father and challengeth all the glorie of god vnto himselfe which if it had not bin right and true he should haue felt the wrath of god with adam and with herod who would needes bee like vnto god but on the contrarie god hath reuenged his death both vpon herod and vpon the iewes and vpon pilate and vpon those emperours that persecuted the church and thus we haue seene the tokens of the scripture whereby it appeareth that the booke of tobit the prayer of manasses the boooke of iudith the booke of baruch the epistle of ieremy the additions to daniel the third and fourth booke of ezra the additions to the book of hester the two bookes of machabees the booke of wisedome and ecclesiasticus are not to be reckoned in the canon reas they are not written by the prophets they are not written in hebrew christ and his apostles alledged in the new testament no testimonies out of those bookes they containe some feigned things and contrarie to the scriptures of the interpretation of the scriptures hitherto hath been spoken of the obiect of preaching the parts thereof are two preparation for the sermon and the promulgation or vttering of it matth then said he vnto them therefore euery scribe which is taught vnto the kingdome of heauen is like vnto an housholder which bringeth forth out of his treasure both new and old in preparation priuate studie is with diligence to be vsed tim till i come giue attendance to reading to exhortation and to doctrine pet of the which saluation the prophets haue inquired and searched which prophecied of the grace that should come vnto you daniel in the first yeere of his raigne i daniel vnderstood by bookes the number of the yeeres concerning the studie of diuinitie take this aduice first diligently imprint both in thy mind and memory the substance of diuinitie described with definitions diuisions and explications of the properties secondly proceede to the reading of the scriptures in this order vsing a grammaticall rhetoricall and logicall opening of the text analysis and the helpe of the rest of the arts reade first the epistle of paul to the rom after that the gospell of john as being indeed the keyes of the new testament and then the other books of the new testamet will be more easie when they are read when all this is done learne first the dogmaticall bookes of the old testament especiallie the psalmes then the propheticall especially esay lastly the historicall but chieflie genesis for it is likelie that the apostles and euangelists read esay and the psalmes very much for there are no bookes of the old testament out of which we can reade more testimonies to be cited then out of these there are about threescore places alledged out of esay and threescore and foure out of the psalmes thirdly out of of sound iu de ement or sound amp iudicious and consonant to god word orthodoxall writings we must get aid not onely from the latter but also from the more ancient church because sathan hath raised vp from the dead the old heretiques that he might hinder the restoratio of the church which is begun to bee made in our time for the antitrinitaries haue newly varnished that opinion of arius and sabellius the anabantists renew the doctrines or sects of the essees catharists enthusiasts and donatists the swenkseldians reuiue the opinions of the eutychians enthusiasts ampc menon followeth ebion and the papists resemble the pharisies encratites tatians pelagians the libertines renew the opinions of the gnosticks and carpocratians seruetus hath reuiued the heresies of samosatenus arrius eutyches marcion and apollinaris lastly the schismatiques that separate themselues from euangelical churches receiue the opinions facts and fashions of pup anus in cyprian of the audians and donatists therefore in like manner wee must not so much seeke for new repealings and confutations of these heresies as wee are for our vse to fetch those ancient ones out of councils and fathers and to accompt them as approued and firme fourthly those things which in studying thou meetest with that are necessarie and worthie to be obserued thou must put in thy tables or common place books that thou maiest alwaies haue in a readines both old and new fiftly before all these things god must carnestly be sued vnto by prayer that hee would blesse these meanes and that he would open the meaning of the scriptures to vs that are blind psalm open mine eies that i may see the wonderfull things of thy law revelation i aduise thee to buy gold for theeand to annoint thine eyes with eye salue that thou maist see hitherto pertaineth the framing of common place bookes concerning which obserue this slender counsel haue in readinesse common place heads of euery point of diuinitie distinguish the formost pages of thy paper booke into two columnes or equall parts lengthwise in euery one of those pages set in the top the title of one head or chiefe point the contrarie side remaining in the meane while emptie that fresh paper may be put to all things which thou readest are not to be written in thy book but those things that are worthie to bee remembred and are seldome met with neither must thou put the words of the author in thy common places but briefly note downe the principall points of stories and of things that thou mayst know from what author to fetch them when thou shalt haue vse and make a point in the author himselfe that thou mayst know that the thing is there handled which thou wrotest in thy common place booke because some things do very often offer theselues with a doubtful signification so as that thou canst not tell if thou write the in thy common places from whence to fetch them therefore to thy common places thou must ioyne an alphabeticall table alwaies prouided that thou trust not too much to thy places for it is not sufficient to haue a thing written in thy booke vnlesse it be also diligentlie laid and locked vp in thy memorie preparation hath two parts interpretation and right diuision or cutting interpretation is the opening of the words and sentences of the scripture that one entire and naturall sense may appeare the church of rome maketh senses of the scriptures the literall allegoricall tropological amp anagogicall as in this her example melchizedek offered bread and wine the literall sense is that the king of salem with meate which he brought refreshed the souldiers of abraham being tyred with trauell the allegoricall is that the priest doth offer vp christin y e masse the tropologicall is therefore something is to be giuen to the poore the anagogicall is that christ in like manner being in heauen shall be the bread of life to the faithfull but this her deuice of the fourefold meaning of the scripture must be exploded and reiected there is one onelie sense and the same is the literall an allegorie is onely a certaine manner of vttering the same sense the anagoge and tropologie are waies whereby the sense may be applied the principall interpreter of the scripture is the holy ghost pet so that ye first know this that no prophecie in the scripture is of any priuate interpretation moreouer he that makes the law is the best and the highest interpreter of the law the supreame and absolute meane of interpretation is the scripture it selfe nehem and they read in the booke of the law of god distinctly and gaue the sense and caused them to vnderstand by the scripture it selfe per scripturam ipsam the meanes subordinated to the scripture are three the analogie of faith the circumstances of the place propounded and the comparing of places together the analogie of faith is a certaine abridgement or summe of the scriptures collected out of most manifest and familiar places the parts thereof are two the first concerneth faith which is handled in the apostles creede the second concerneth charitie or loue which is explicated in the ten commaundements tim keepe the true paterne of the wholsome words which thou hast heard of me with faith and loue which is in christ iesus the circumstances of the place propounded are these who to whom vpon what occasion at what time in what place for what end what goeth before what followeth the collation or comparing of places together is that whereby places are set like parallels one beside another that the meaning of them may more euidentlie appeare act but saul increased the more in strength and confounded the iewes which dwelt at damascus confirming that is conferring or conioyning of places of scriptures as artificers being about to compact or ioyne a thing together are wont to fit all the parts amongst themselues that one of them may perfectly agree with each other that this was that christ collation of places is two fold the first is the comparing of the place propounded with it selfe cited and repeated else where in holy writ isaiah make the heart of this people fat make their eares heauie and shut their eyes lest they see with their eyes and heare with their eares and vnderstand with their hearts and conuert and he heale them this place is sixe times repeated in the new testament mat marke luke john act rom places repeated haue often alterations for sundrie causes these causes are first exegeticall that is for exposition sake as psalm compared with mat i will ope my mouth in a parable i will declare occulta things hidden from of old i will ope my mouth in parables and will vtter the things which haue been kept secret from the foundation of the world psalm john he gaue them of the wheat of heauen he gaue the bread from heauen to eate isai rom behold i will lay in sion a stone a tried stone a precious corner stone a sure foudation he that beleeueth shall not make bast behold i lay in sion a stumbling block and a rocke to make man fal and euery one that beleeueth in him shall not be ashamed psalm corinthian sit thou at my right hand vntill i make thine enemy thy foot stoole he must raigne till he haue put all his enemy vnder his feet psalm corinthian i beleeued quia because i did speake i beleeued and therefore haue i spoken gen gal all the land which thou seest will i giue vnto thee and to thy now to abraham and to his seede were the promises made seede for euer he saith not vnto the seedes as speaking of many but and to thy seed as of one which is christ a second cause is diacriticall or for discerning sake that places and times and persons might bee mutuallie distinguished michah mat and thou bethlehem ephrathah article little to be among the princes of iudah out of thee shall hee come forth to me that shall be the ruler in israel and thou bethlehem in the land of iudah article not the least among the princes of iudah for out of thee shall come the gouernour that shall feed my people israel thirdly these causes are circumscriptiue or for limitation sake that the sense and sentence of the place might be truelie restrained according as the minde and meaning of the holy ghost was deut mat thou shalt worship the lord thy god and shalt serue him thou shalt worship the lord thy god and him onelie shalt thou serue isai matth this people draweth neere with their mouth and honor me with their lips but their heart they reremooue farre from me and their reuerence towards mee is by the commandemet of man when this people draweth neere vnto me they honour mee with their mouth and with their lippes but they remooue their heart farre from me in vaine doe they worship me teaching for doctrines the comandements of man gen mat wherefore a man shall leaue his father and his mother and shall cleane vnto his wife and they shall be one flesh wherefore a man shall leaue father and mother amp shal cleane vnto his wife amp they which were two shall be one flesh isai rom and the redeemer shall come vnto sion and vnto them that turne from iniquitie in iacob saith the lord the deliuerer shall come out of sion and shall turne away the vngodlines from iacob a fourth cause is for application sake that the type might bee fitted vnto the trueth and the generall to a ceretaine speciall and so contrariwise ionas matth now the lord had prepared a great fish to swallow vp ionah and ionah was in the bellie of the fish three daies and three nights an euill and adulterous generation seeketh a signe but no signe shall be giuen vnto it saue the signe of the prophet ionas for as ionas was three dayes and three nights in the whale bellie so shall the son of man be ampc esay luke the spirit of the lord god is vpo me therefore hath the lord annointed mee hee hath sent mee to preach good tidings vnto the poore to bind vp the broken hearted to preach libertie to the captiues and to the that are bound the opening of the prison to preach the acceptable yere of the lord and the day of vengeance of our god the spirit of the lord is vpon mee therefore he hath annointed mee that i should preach good tidings to the poore hee hath sent me to heale the broken in heart that i should preach deliuerance to the captiues ampc this day is this scripture fulfilled in your eares psalm john they gaue me gall for my meate and in my thirst they gaue me vineger to drinke that the scripture might bee fulfilled hee said i thirst therfore there was set a vessell full of vineger and they filled a sponge with vineger and put it about an bysope stalke amp put it to his mouth exod ioh neither shall yee breake a bone thereof these things were done that the scripture might bee fulfilled which saith there shall not a bone of him be broken psalm acts let their habitations be voyd and let none dwell in their tents it is written in the booke of the psalmes let his habitation be void and let no man dwell therein fiftly some things are omitted for breuitie sake or because they do not agree with the matter in hand zach matth reioyce greatly o daughter sion shout for ioy o daughter tell ye the daughter of sion behold thy king commeth vnto ierusalem behold thy king commeth vnto thee he is iust and saued himselfe poore and riding vpon an asse and vpon a colt the foule of an asse thee meek and sitting vpon an asse and a colt the foale of an asse vsed to the yoke the second collation is of the place propounded with other places and those againe are either like or vnlike places that are alike are such as by certaine waies or in some sort agree one with another and places doe agree either in their phrase and manner of speech or in sense places that agree as concerning the phrase are such as these gen john then he dreamed amp behold there stoode a ladder vpon the earth and the top of it reached vp to heauen and loe the angels of god went vp and he said vnto him uerilie verilie i say vnto you hereafter shall yee

smelling sauour to god for the finding out of these places the greeke and hebrew concordances serue very fitlie places which agree in sense are those that haue the same meaning here excelleth the comparing of a generall place with a special exaple in the same kind as prou psalm he that hideth his sinnes shall not prosper but he that confesseth and forsaketh them shall find mercy when i held my tongue my bones consumed ampc i acknowledged my finne vnto thee neither hid i mine iniquitie i said i will confesse against my selfe my wickednes vnto the lord and thou forgauest the punishmet of my sinne sam pet the king charged zadok saying carrie the arke of god againe into the citie if i shall find fauour in the eies of the lord he wil bring me again and shew mee both it and the tabernacle thereof but if he thus say i haue no delight in thee behold here am i let him doe to mee as seemeth good in his eyes humble your selues therefore vnder the mightie hand of god that he may extol you in due time thou shalt haue readie very manie places of this kind in the common places of marlorate gathered together with diligence and thus much for places that are alike places that are vnlike are those which in shew doe not agree either in respect of the phrase or in regard of the meaning as rom iam therefore we conclude that a man is iustified by faith without the workes of the law yee see therefore how that of works a man is iustified and not of faith onlie king chronicle and they came to ophir amp they fetched from thence foure hundred and twenty talents of gold and brought it to king

prophet saying and they tooke thirtie siluer peeces ampc of the waies of expounding the manner or waies of interpreting are according to the places of scripture which are to be handled places are either analogical amp plaine or crypticall and darke analogicall places are such as haue an apparent meaning agreeable to the analogie of faith and that at the first view concerning these places receiue this rule if the naturall signification of the words of the place propounded doe agree with the circumstances of the same place it is the proper meaning of the place as for example act to him also giue all the prophets witnes that through his name all that beleeue in him shall receiue remission of sins the significatio of the words of this place is very manifest to wit that iesus christ doth giue righteousnesse and euerlasting life to those that doe beleeue in him and this sense wee doe presently admit without any delay because wee see that it doth agree with the analogie of faith and with the holy scriptures we must further know that euery article and doctrine concerning faith and maners which is necessary vnto saluation is very plainely deliuered in the scriptures crypticall or hidden places are those which are difficult and darke for the expounding of them let this be thy rule and leader if the natiue or naturall signification of the words doe manifestly disagree with either the analogy of faith or very perspicuous places of the scripture the the other meaning which is giuen of the place propounded is naturall and proper if it agree with contrarie and like places with the circumstances and wordes of the place and with the nature of that thing which is intreated of as for example corinthian this is my body which is broken for you the sense that is giuen by some this bread is indeed and properlie the bodie of christ namely by conuersion or the body of christ in vnder or with the bread the vnfitnesse of this sense the letter or words vsed in this place being retained or expounded accordingly without any alteration doth disagree with an article of the faith he ascended into heauen and with the nature of a sacrament which ought to be a memoriall of the bodie of christ absent therefore a new exposition is to be sought for a new or second sense in this place the bread is a signe of my bodie by a metonymie of the subiect for the adiunct the fitnes of this exposition first it agrees with the analogy of faith he ascended truly into heauen that is he was taken vp out of the earth into heaued locally and visibly therefore his bodie is not to be receiued with the mouth at the communion but by faith prehending it in the heauen borne of the uirgin marie ampc therfore he had a true and naturall bodle being long broad thicke seated and circumscribed in some place whereby it appeareth that the bread in the supper cannot bee properly his very bodie but only a signe or pledge thereof secondly this sense consenteth with the circumstances of the place propounded he tooke he brake it here it is not likely that christ sitting amongst his disciples did take and breake his owne bodie with his hands therefore the bread is no more then a signe and seale deliuered or giuen for you the bread can in no wise be said to bee giuen for vs but the bodie of christ therefore the bread is not properly the bodie but symbolically or by way of signification the cup is the new testament not properly but by a metonymie therefore nothing hindreth but that a metonymie may be as well in these words this is my bodie christ himselfe did eate of the bread but he did not eate himself doe yee this in remembrance of me therefore christ is not corporallie present to the mouth but spiritually to the faith of the heart untill he come therefore christ is absent in his bodie christ said not vnder the forme of bread or in the bread but he said this that is this bread is my bodie thirdly this sense accords with the nature of a sacrament in which wee must make a proportion and resemblance betweene the signe and the thing signified which here can bee none if the bread bee properly the bodie fourthly it agrees with like places gen this is my couenant which yee shall keepe between you and me ye shall circumcise the fore skin of your flesh and it shall be a signe of the couenant between me and you corinthian they dranke of the spirituall rocke that followed them and the rocke was christ rom hee receiued the signe of circumcision which might seale the righteousnes of faith exod the lambe is the lord passeouer verse it is a signe of his passing ouer act be baptised for the remission of sinnes ioh and iesus said vnto them i am the bread of life he that commeth vnto me shall not hunger and hee that beleeueth in me shall neuer thirst corinthian the cup of blessing which wee blesse is it not the communion of the bloud of christ the bread which we break is it not the communion of the body of christ that is a signe of the communion fiftly it agreeth with the lawes of logique for one disparate is not spoken or predicated of another but by a borrowed speech sixtly it is agreeable to the common custome of speaking so we put the fasces or bundle of rods vsed to bee caried before magistrates for gouernement it selfe the gowne we put for peace and the laurell garland for a triumph as in cicero cedant armatogae concedat laurea linguae therefore this other sense is proper now from this fruitfull rule doe arise many consectaries or conclusions necessarie for the vnderstanding of the scriptures ephesian for which cause i paul the prisoner of iesus christ for you gentiles the sentence is defectiue therefore a supply must be made and let this bee the supplie i will be an embassadour for you gentiles this

departure of the israelites out of egypt after this manner the time of their abode in the wildernes was yeers the time of the gouernment of ioshua was yeeres of othoniel yeeres iudg of ehud and samgar

be because this euen number of three hundred is fitter both for the computation and the speech for breuitie sake iudg there were slaine of the beniamites twentie fiue thousand heere an hundred are not counted as appeareth verse the israelites slew that day of the tribe of beniamin fiue and twentie thousand and a hundred man the king being hindred either with foreign war or with old age or by reason of some disease doth whiles he yet liueth appoint his son to bee king in his stead and therefore with the computations of the yeeres of father and son raigning at one time the yeeres of the raigne are reckoned sometimes ioyntlie and sometimes apart king king ahaziah died and iehoram raigned in his stead in the second yeere of iehoram the son of iehosaphat king of iudah ichoram the son of ahab raigned in the eighteenth yeere of iehosaphat chap in the fift yere of ioram the son of ahab iehoram the son of iehoshaphat began to raigne and raigned eight yeeres iehoshaphat determining in the seuenteenth yeere of his reigne to helpe king ahab against the syrians appointeth his son ioram to be vice roy in the eighteenth yeere of his owne reigne and in the second of his sonnes ioram the son of ahab reigned afterwards in the fift yeere of this ioram the son of ahab iehosaphat being strucken in age confirmeth his kingdome to his son ioram who is said to haue reigned eight yeeres foure

comprehended from the death of ioshua to the death of othoniel as also the eight yeeres of seruitude vnder the syrians iudg the land had rest yeers here from the death of othoniel are numbred also the

worship which notwithstanding should haue been chiefly noted if so bee that it had raigned among the people of god i lay downe this rule not because i thinke that the hebrew and greeke text is in all copies corrupted through the malice of the iewes as lindanus doth wickedly calumniate and after him all papists but that the diverse readings which in some places haue crept in either by reason of the vnskilfulnesse or negligence and ouersight of the notaries might be skanned and determined as psalm in ordinary copies the words runne thus caari that is as a lion my hands and my feete in other copies the reading is diverse after this manner caaru they haue digged or pierced my hands and my feete now the rule propounded doth teach that this latter reading is to be followed for it agreeth with grammaticall construction with the circumstances of the psalme with some ancient copies yes euen by the testimonie of the iewes of the right diuiding of the word hitherto wee haue spoken of interpreting the word wee are now come to speake of the right cutting or the right diuiding of it right cutting of the word is that whereby the word is made fit to edifie the people of god tim study to shew thy selfe approued vnto god a workeman that neede not to be ashamed diuiding or cutting the word of trueth aright it is a metaphor taken it may bee from the leuites who might not cut the members of the sacrifices without due consideration isai the lord hath giuen me the tongue of the learned that i might know to minister a word in due season to him that is wearie the partes thereof are two resolution or partition and application resolution is that whereby the place propounded is as a weauers web resolued or vntwisted and vnloosed into sundrie doctrines act mightilie he confuted the iewes with great vehemencie publikely shewing by scriptures that iesus was that christ resolution is either notation or collection notation is when as the doctrine is expressed in the place propounded rom we haue alreadie proued that all both iewes and gentiles are vnder sinne as it is written there is none righteous no not one there is none that vnderstandeth none that seeketh god all are gone out of the way they haue been made altogether vnprofitable there is none that doth good no not one act whom god hath raised vp and loosed the sorrowes of death because it was impossible that he shuld be held of it for dauid saith concerning him i beheld the lord alwaies before me for he is at my right hand that i should not bee shaken therefore did mine heart reioyee and my tongue was glad and moreouer also my flesh shall rest in hope because thou wilt not not leaue my soule with the dead neither wilt suffer thine holy one to see corruption collection is when the doctrine not expressed is soundly gathered out of y e text this is done by the helpe of the nine arguments that is of the causes effects subiects adiuncts dissentanies names distribution and definition for example a place the collection john iesus answered them is it not written in your law i said yee are god from the comparison of the less if hee called the god vnto whom the word of god was giuen and the scripture cannot bee broken say yee of me whom the father hath sanctified and sent into the world thou blasphemest because i said i am the son of god a place the collection from the less corinthian for it is written in the law of moses thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the oxe that treadeth out the corne what hath god care of oxen verse haue we not power to eate and to drinke a place the collection from the contrarie gal for so many as are of the workes of the law are vnder a curse for it is written cursed is euery one that continueth not in al things which are in the book of the law to do them verse therfore those which are of faith are blessed with faithfull abraham verse for the iust shal liue by faith verse and that no man is iustified by the law before god it is euident a place a collection from the adiunct heb for in rebuking them he saith behold the daies will come saith the lord when i shall make with the house of israel amp with the house of iudah a new testament heb in that he saith a new testament hee hath disanulled the old now that which is disanulled and waxed old is readie to vanish away in gathering of doctrines we must specially remember that an example in his owne kind that is an ethique oeconomique politic ordinarie and extraordinarie example hath the virtue of a general rule in ethique oeconomique politic ordinarie amp extraordinarie matters the examples of the fathers are paterns for vs corinthian rom and whatsoeuer is written is written for our learning and it is a principle in logique that the or general genus is actually in all the or specials and particulars of that kind or generall species and a rule in the optiques that the generall species of things are perceiued before the particular a place the collection from the species rom neither are they all children because they are the seede of abraham but in isaac shal thy seed be called neither he only felt this but also rebecca when shee had conceiued by one euen by our father isaac verse that is they which are the children of the flesh are not the children of god but the children of the promise are counted for the seede rom which abraham against hope beleeued vnder hope ampc being fully assured that hee which had promised was also able to doe it and therefore it was imputed to him for righteousnesse rom now it is not written for him onely that it was imputed to him for righteousnes but for vs also to whom it shal be imputed for righteousnesse which beleeue in him that raised vp iesus our lord from the dead that also i adde that collections ought to be right and sound that is to say deriued from the genuine and proper meaning of the scripture if otherwise wee shall draw aduerb any thing out of any thing quidlibet quolibet any doctrine from any place prou the greeke translation of the seuentie interpreters is the lord hath created me it is the speech of wisedome that is of christ speaking of himselfe whence the arrians collect very wickedly that the son was created but in the hebrew it is iehouah kanneni the lord hath possessed mee now the father possesseth the son because hee begat him from eternitie and because the father is in the son and the son in the father and so gen when a son was borne vnto adam he saith i haue possessed a man from the lord the error perhaps came of this that he hath created ectise was either through ignorance or malice put for be hath possessed ectese augustine also vpon the tenth verse of the psalme readeth on this wife i held my peace because thou hast made me fecistime from whence hee doth wittily gather that it is a marueile that he should holde his tongue that hath receiued a mouth to speake whereas me is neither in the hebrew nor in the greeke and vpon the psalme and verse he disputeth much about vsuries and proueth that vsuries are sinnes whereas there is no such matter in that text for the words are he shall deliuer their soule from deceit and violence so precious is their blood in his eyes it shall be lawful also to gather allegories for they are arguments taken from things that are like and paul in his teaching vseth them often corinthian but they are to bee vsed with these cautions let them be vsed sparingly and soberly let them not be farre fetcht but fitting to the matter in hand they must be quickly dispatcht they are to bee vsed for instruction of the life and not to proue any point of faith any point of doctrine collected by iust consequence is simply of it selfe to bee beleeued and doth demonstrate act and a certaine iew named apollos borne at alexandria came to ephesus an eloquent man and mightie in the scriptures for mightily he confuted the iewes publikely with great vehemencie demonstrating by the scriptures that iesus was the christ from hence it followeth first that humane testimonies whether of the philosophers or of the fathers are not to be alleaged augustine vpon the psalme saith thus if i speake let no man heare if christ speake woe bee to him that doth not heare so againe he saith de vnitat ecclesiae let vs not heare these things i say these things he saith but let vs heare these things the lord saith yet with this exception vnlesse they conuince the conscience of the hearer thus paul alleaged the testimonie of aratus act for by him wee liue and moue and haue our being as one of your owne poets hath said for wee are all his progenie forasmuch then as we are the progenie of god ampc as also a saying of menander corinthian be not deceiued euill conuersations corrupt good manners and of epimenides tit as one of their prophets hath said the cretians are alwaies liars euill beast and slow bellies and then also it must be done sparingly and with leauing out the name of the prophane writer secondly that a few testimonies of scripture are to be vsed for the proofe of the doctrine and that sometimes there is neede of none lastly hence it followes that the prophets deliuering their doctrine thus are not to bee reprooued of other prophets corinthian and the spirits of the prophets are subiect vnto the prophets yet afterwards hee addeth verse if any one seeme to be a prophet or spirituall let him acknowledge that those things which i write vnto you are the commandements of god of the waies how to vse and applie doctrines application is that wherby the doctrine rightlie collected is diuerslly fitted according as place time and person doe require ezek i will feede my sheepe and bring them to their rest saith the lord i will seeke that which is lost and bring againe that which was driuen away and will bind vp that which was broken and will strengthen the sicke iude and hauing compassion of some in putting difference and saue other with terror pulling them out of the flame the foundation of application is to know whether the place propounded be a sentence of the law or of the gospell for when the word is preached there is one operation of the law and another of the gospell for the law is thus farre forth effectuall as to declare vnto vs the disease of sinne and by accident to exasperate and stirre it vp but it affords no remedie now the gospel as it teacheth what is to be done so it hath also the efficacy of the holy ghost adioyned with it by whom we being regenerated we haue strength both to beleeue the gospell and to performe those things which it commaundeth the law therefore is the first in the order of teaching and the gospell second it is a sentence of the law which speaketh of perfect inherent righteousnes of eternall life giuen through the works of the law of the contrarie sins and of the curse that is due vnto them gal so many as are of the workes of law are vnder the curse for it is written cursed is he whosoeuer abideth not in all things which are written in the booke of the law to doe them matth o generation of vipers who hath fore warned you to flee from the anger to come and now also is the axe put to the roote of the trees therfore euery tree which bringeth not forth good fruit is cut vp and cast into the fire a sentence of the gospell is that which speaketh of christ and his benefits and of faith being fruitfull in good workes as john so god loued the world that hee gaue his onely begotten son that whosoeuer beleeueth in him should not perish but haue euerlasting life hence it is that many sentences which seeme to belong to the law are by reason of christ to bee vnderstood not legally but with the euangelic qualification of the gospell luke blessed are those which heare the word of god and keepe it deut this commandement which i command thee this day is not hidden nor set a farre off but it is by thee in thy month and in thine heart this sentence which is legall in moses is euangelicalll in paul rom psalm blessed are those that are perfect in the way who walke in the law of iehouah blessed are they that keepe his testimonies and seeke him with their whole heart john hee that hath my commandements and keepeth them is he that loueth me he that loueth me shall be loued of my father if any man doe loue me hee will keepe my word and my father doth loue him and we will come vnto him and wee will dwell with him gen noah was a iust and vpright man in his time noah walked with god indefinenter continually gen i am the strong god omnipotent walke alway before me and be vpright the waies of application are chieflie seuen according to the diverse condition of man and people which is seuenfold these man in the first place are to bee prepared to receiue the doctrine of the word chro iehosaphat sent leuites throughout the cities of iudah to teach the people and to bring them from idols this preparation is to be made partly by disputing or reasoning with them that thou maist throughly discerne their manners and disposition and partly by reprouing in them some notorious sinne that being pricked in heart and terrified they may become teachable act hee disputed in the synagogue with the iewes and with them that were religious and in the market place with whomsoeuer he met act now as hee iournied it came to passe that as hee was come neere to damascus suddenly there shined round about him a light from heauen and hee fell to the earth and heard a voyce saying to him saul saul why persecutest thou me and he said who article thou lord and the lord answered i am iesus of nazaret whom thou doest persecute it is hard for thee to kicke against the pricks act then the keeper of the prison awoke out of his sleepe and when he saw the prison doores open he drew out his sword and would haue killed himself supposing the prisoners had bin fled then paul cried with a loud voice saying doe thy selfe no harme for we are all here then he called for a light and leaped in and came trembling and fell downe before paul and silas and brought them out and said sirs what must i doe to be saued and they said beleeue in the lord iesus and thou shalt be saued and thine household act and paul stood in the midst of marsstreete and said ye man of athens i see that in all things ye are too superstitious for as i passed by and beheld your deuotions i found an altar wherein was written unto the vnknowne god whom ye then ignorantly worship him shew i vnto you god that made the world and all things in it seeing that he is lord of heauen and earth dwelleth not in temples made with hands when now there is hope that they are become teachable and prepared the doctrine of god word is to be declared to them generally in some common termes or ordinarie points act and the time of this ignorance god regarded not but now he commandeth all man euerie where to repent because hee hath appointed a day in which hee will iudge the world in righteousnes by that man whom he hath appointed whereof hee hath assured all man in that hee hath raised him from the dead if they shal approue this doctrine then it is to be opened to them distinctly amp in euery particular but if they shall remaine vnteachable without hope of winning them they are to be left matth giue not that which is holy vnto dogges neither cast your pearles before swine lest they tread them vnder their feete and turning againe all to rent you prou reprooue not a scorner lest hee hate thee act but when certaine man were hardned and would not obey speaking euill of the way of the lord before the multitude he departed from them and separated the disciples from them to these man the catechisme must bee deliuered act apollos was catechized in the way of the lord and he spake feruentlie in the spirit amp taught diligently the things of the lord knowing only the baptisme of john and hee began to speake boldlie in the synagogue whom when aquila and priscilla had heard they tooke him vnto them and expounded vnto him the way of god more perfectly luke that thou maist know the trueth of those things whereof thou hast been catechized or instructed the catechisme is the doctrine of the foundation of christian religion brieflie propounded for the helpe of the vnderstanding and memorie in questions and answers made by the liuely voyce the matter therfore of the catechisme is the foundation of religion the foundation is a certaine summe of the principles of christianitie heb for when as concerning the time ye ought to be teachers yet haue yee neede againe that we teach you the first principles of the word of god a principle is that which doth directly and immediatly serue both for the saluation of man and for the glorie of god which being also denied and ouerturned no saluation can be hoped for there are especiallie sixe principles repentance faith baptismes that is the sacraments imposition of hands that is the ministerie of the word by a synecdoche the resurrection and the last iudgement heb the forme of the catechisme is to handle the elements or grounds plainelie by asking and answering pet to the which also the figure that now saueth vs euen baptisme agreeth not the putting away of the filthines of the flesh but the stipulation or interrogation of a good conscience act what doth let me to be baptized and philip said vnto him if thou beleeuest with all thine heart thou maist then hee answered saying i beleeue that iesus christ is the son of god tertullian de resurrect carnis saith the soule is not purged with washing but with answering and here wee must hold a difference betweene milke and strong meate which are the same indeede but do differ in the manner and fashion of deliuering milke is a certaine briefe plaine and generall explication of the principles of the faith as when a man doth teach y t we must beleeue one god and three persons father son amp holy ghost and that we must relie only vpon the grace of god in christ and that wee ought to beleeue the remission of sinnes and when wee are taught that we ought to repent to obstaine from euill and to doe that which is good strong meate is a speciall copious luculent and cleere handling of the doctrine of faith as when the condition of man before the fall his fall originall and actuall sinne mans guiltinesse free will the mysteries of the trinitie the two natures of christ the personall vnion the office of christ the imputation of righteousnes faith grace and the vse of the law are deliuered out of the word of god distinctly and exactly moreouer milke must bee set before babes that is those that are rude or weak in knowledge strong meat must be giuen to such as are of ripe yeres that is to them that are better instructed corinthian moreouer brother i could not speake vnto you as to spirituall but i haue spoken vnto you as to carnall that is to infants in christ i haue fed you with milke and not with meate heb in such the foundation of repentance ought to bee stirred vp that is to say a certaine sorrow which is according to god corinthian for though i made you sorrie with a letter i repent not though i did repent for i perceiue that the same epistle made you sorie though it were but for a season i now reioyce not that yee were sory but that ye sorrowed to repentance for yee sorrowed according to god so that in nothing ye were hurt by vs for sorrow which is according to god or godly causeth repentance vnto saluation not to bee repented of but worldly sorrow causeth death sorrow according to god is a griefe for sinne euen because it is sinne to the stirring vp of this affection in the first place a man must vse the ministerie of the law which may beget contrition of heart or the horrors of conscience which though it bee not a thing wholesome and profitable of it owne nature yet is it a remedie necessarie for the subduing of a sinners stubbernnesse and for the preparing of his minde to become teachable now that this legall sorrow may be wrought it is fit to vse some choyce parcell of the law which may reprooue some one notable sinne in man that are not as yet humbled for sorrow for and repentance or though but euen of one sinne is for substance sorrow for and repentance of all act repent therefore of this thy wickednes and pray god that if it be possible the thought of thine heart may be forgiuen thee act him haue yee taken by the hands of the wicked being deliuered by the determinate counsell and foreknowledge of god and haue crucified and slaine psalm yes further if any man being afflicted with the crosse and with outward calamities haue only a worldly sorrow that is if he mourne not for sinne as it is sinne but for the punishment of sinne hee is not by and by to be comforted but first this sorrow is to be turned into that other sorrow which is godly according to god as is the counsell of physitians in the like case for if a mans life be in danger by reason of bloud gushing out at his nose they commaund also that bloud bee let out in his arme or in some other place as the case requireth that they might stay the course of the bloud which rusheth out at the nostrils that so they might saue his life who was readie to yeeld vp the ghost then let the gospell be preached in the preaching wherof the holy spirit worketh effectually vnto saluation for whilst he reneweth man that they may begin to will and to worke those things that are pleasing to god he doth truely and properly bring forth in them that sorrow which is according to god and repentance vnto saluation to the hard harted the law must bee vrged and the curse of the law must bee denounced with threatning together with the difficultie of obtaining deliuerance vntill they bee purified in the heart matth and when hee saw many of the pharises and of the sadduces come to his baptisme he said vnto them o progeny of vipers who hath forewarned you to flie from the wrath to come matth good master what shall i doe that i may haue eternall life and he said vnto himif thou wilt enter into life keepe the commaundements mat woe vnto you scribes and pharisies hypocrites because ye shut vp the kingdome of heauen before man for yee your selues goe not in neither suffer ye those that are entring in to go in ampc verse o serpents and progeny of vipers how shall ye escape the damnation of hell but when the beginning of compunction doth appeare they are presently to be comforted with the gospell here we must very diligently consider whether their humiliation bee compleat and sound or but begun and but light or slight lest that hee or they receiuing comfort sooner than is meete should afterwards wax more hard like iron which being cast into the fornace becomes exceeding hard after that it is once cold let thy proceeding bee after this manner with those that are humbled in part let the law bee propounded yet so discreetly tempered with the gospell that being terrified with their sinnes and with the meditation of god iudgement they may together also at the same instant receiue solace by the gospell act then peter said vnto him thy monie perish with thee because thou thinkest that the gift of god may be obtained by monie thou hast neither part nor fellowship in this busines for thine hart is not right in the sight of god repent therefore of this thy wickednes and pray god that if it be possible the cogitation of thine heart may bee remitted for i see that thou article in the gall of bitternes and in the bond of iniquity gen and the lord god cried vnto adam and said vnto him where article thou and god said who hath shewed thee that thou article naked what hast thou eaten of the fruit of that tree of which i forbad thee to eat and the lord god said to the woman what is this which thou hast done and the woman said this serpent hath seduced me and i haue eaten moreouer i will put enmitie between thee and this woman and likewise betweene thy seede and her seede this shall breake thine head and thou shalt bruise his heele sam nathan being sent from god by a parable which hee doth propound he recalleth dauid to the conscience of his fact and pronounceth pardon to him being penitent the doctrine of faith and repentance and the comforts of the gospell ought to be promulged and tendred to those that are fully humbled luke the spirit of the lord is vpon me therefore he hath annointed mee to preach glad tidings to the poore he hath sent me to heale the contrite in heart to preach deliuerance to the captiues and to the blind the recouerie of their sight and to set at libertie those that were broken act when they heard these things they were pricked in heart and said vnto peter and the rest of the apostles man and brother what shall wee doe and peter said vnto them repent and bee baptised euerie one of you in the name of iesus christ for the remission of sinnes matth i came not to call the iust but sinners vnto repantance to these must be propounded the gospell of iustification sanctification and perseuerance the law without the curse whereby they may be taught to bring forth fruites of new obedience beseeming repentance rom there is no condemnation to those that are in christ iesus tim the law is not appointed for the righteous let the epistle of paul to the romans be the example howsoeuer the curse of the law is not to be vrged against the person that is righteous and holy in the sight of god yet it is to be vrged against the sinnes of the person which are remaining and as a father doth oftentimes set his iron rods that are appointed for the servant before the eyes of his sonnes that they may be frayed so the meditation of the curse is to be stirred vp very often in the faithfull themselues left they should abuse the mercie of god to licencious liuing and that they may be more fully humbled for sanctification is but in part therefore that the remainders of sinne may bee abolished wee must alwaies begin with the meditation of the law and with the feeling of sinne and make an end in the gospell those that are fallen are they which doe in part fall from the state of grace falling is either in faith or in manners falling in faith is either in the knowledge of the doctrine of the gospell or in the apprehending of christ falling in knowledge is a declining into error whether lighter or fundamentall now vnto those that fall thus that doctrine which doth crosse their error is to be demonstrated and inculcated or beaten vpon them together with the doctrine of repentance and that with a brotherly affection take for an example the epistle of paul to the galatians tim instructing them with meekenes that are contrarilie affected if god at any time will giue them repentance that they may know the trueth the fall which is in apprehending christ is desperation for the restoring of those that doe despaire there are to be vsed a triall and the remedie the triall or search is either of the cause of the temptation or of their estate the triall of the cause is made fitly by priuate confession iam confesse your sinnes one to another and pray for one another that ye may be healed but lest that confession should bee made a kinde of racke or torture it must be limited with these prouisoes it ought to be free and not compelled because saluation depends not vpon it it must not be of all sinnes but of those onely which wring the conscience which vnlesse they doe reueale greater danger may hang ouer their heads let it chiefely be made to pastours yet so as that we must know that it may be safely made to other faithfull man in the church the triall of their estate is whereby we make diligent inquirie whether they be vnder the law or vnder grace that this may manifestly appeare we must by asking of questions first draw out of them whether they be displeased with themselues because they haue displeased god that is to say whether they hate sinne as it is sinne which is the foundation of repentance vnto saluation secondly we must demaund of them whether they haue or doe feele in their heart a desire to be reconciled with god which is the ground of a liuely faith when triall is made the remedie must be applied vnto them out of the gospell which is double first some euangelicall meditations are to bee often inculcated and pressed vpon them as that their sinne is pardonable that the promises are generall in respect of beleeuers and that they are indefinite in respect of particular man and doe exclude no man that the will to beleeue is faith psalm revelation that sinne doth not abolish grace but rather god turning all things vnto the good of those that are his doth illustrate it that all the works of god are done by contrarie meanes secondly they must be intreated to stirre vp in them in the very bitternes of the temptation their faith which hath lien in a swoune and bin sopitam fidem couered as it were with ashes and that they would certainely set downe with themselues that their sinnes are forgiuen them and that it would please them to struggle manfully in prayer either alone or with others against carnall sense and humane hope and that they may performe these things they must be very earnestly beaten vpon and those that are vnwilling must in a manner bee constrained psalm out of the depths haue i called to thee o lord lord listen vnto my voyce let thine eares attend to the voice of my praiers psalm my voice came to god when i prayed my voice went to god that hee would turne his eare vt aduertat aurem vnto me in the day of my distresse i besought the lord rom who abraham against

prescribed in the word sam then dauid saidto nathan i haue sinned against the lord wherefore nathan saied to dauid godhath also forgiuen thy sinne thou shalt not dye corinthian therefore wee are embassadours in the name of christ god as it were beseeching you by vs wee pray you in the name of christ that yee would be reconciled to god and if perhaps melancholie trouble the minde the helpe of the medicine must be in priuate sought for falling in manners is when any faithfull man falleth to the committing of some actuall sinne in life as noahs drunkennesse dauids adulterie peters deniall ampc to those that are fallen thus forsomuch as grace remaining in respect of her vertue and habit may be lost for a time in respect of sense and working the law must bee propounded being mixed with the gospell because a new acte of sinne requires a new acte or worke of faith and repentance isa ah sinfull nation a people laden with iniquitie a seede of the wicked corrupt children they haue forsaken the lord they haue prouoked the holy one of israel to anger they are gone backeward wash you make you cleane take away the euill of your works from before mine eyes ampc come now and let vs reason together saith the lord though your sinnes were as crimsin they shall bee made white as snow though they were red like skarlet they shall be as wooll amixt people are the assemblies of our churches to these any doctrine may be propounded whether of the law or of the gospell if the i if it be limited and meant to them limitation and circumscription of the doctrine be made to those persons for whom it is conuenient john now in the last and great day of the feast iesus stoode and cried saying if any man thirst let him come vnto mee and drinke and this was the manner of the prophets in their sermons to denounce iudgements and destruction to the wicked and to promise deliuerance in the messias to those that do repent a doubt if any man shall despaire in the publike congregation when the rest are hardened what ought to be done ans let those that are hardened heare the law circumscribed within the limits of the persons and of the vices and let the afflicted conscience heare the voyce of the gospell applied in speciall manner vnto it of the kinds of application application is either mentall or practicall mentall is that which respecteth the minde and it is either doctrine or improouing confuting redargution tim the whole scripture is giuen by god inspiration and is profitable for doctrine for redargution or improouing for correction and for instruction in righteousnesse that the man of god may be perfect being perfectly instructed vnto euery good worke doctrine is that whereby doctrine or teaching is vsed for the information of the minde to a right iudgement concerning things to be beleeued redargution is that whereby teaching is vsed for the reformation of the minde from error in confutations which are made publikely before the assembly these cautions must be vsed the thing that is determined or the state of the question that is to bee discussed must bee throughly vnderstood let those errors onely be reprooued which trouble the church in which we liue all other being altogether let alone which doe either lie dead or are externall vnlesse some daunger bee readie to ensue of them matth beware of the leauen of the pharisees and saduces mark take heede and beware of the leauen of herod reue the man of pergamus are warned to beware of the nicolaitans to whom some of them did assent if the error be out of the foundation of faith the confutation must not onely be christianlike as it should be euer but also a friendly a gentle and brotherly dissention practicall application is that which respecteth the life and behauiour and it is instruction and correction instruction is that whereby doctrine is applied to frame a man to liue well in the or gouernment of the familie oiconomia family common wealth and church to this place belong consolation and exhortation rom correction is that wherby the doctrine is applied to reforme the life from vngodlines and vnrighteous dealing hitherto belongs admonition this must be done first generally the circumstances of the persons being omitted sam nathan brings dauid to the knowledge of his sinne by the helpe of a generall parable act ye see and heare that not onely at ephesus but almost throughout all asia this paul hath perswaded and turned away much people because he saith that those are not god which are made with hands then the towne clerke when hee had stayed the people said ye man of ephesus ampc ye haue brought hither these man which haue neither committed sacriledge neither doe blaspheme your goddesse afterwards if the former reproofe preuaile not it must be vrged after a more speciall manner tim them that sinne rebuke openly that the rest may also feare but alwaies in the very hatred of sinne let the loue of the person appeare in the speeches and let the minister include himselfe if he may in his reprehension that it may bee more milde and gentle daniel then danielsaid my lord the dreame be to them that hate thee and the interpretation thereof to thine enemy the tree which thou sawestit is thou gal we that are iewes by nature and not sinners of the gentiles corinthian these things brother i haue by a kinde of figure translated to my selfe and to apollo for you that yee might learne by vs not to be wise aboue that which is written now these foure kinds of application doe offer themselues in euery sentence of the scripture i will also set downe that example which illyricus hath propounded doctrine that it is needfull for vs publikely to professe the doctrine which we know so often as there is need that wee must make confession also with the hazzard of goods and life that our life should bee contemned in comparison of christ and his trueth that eternall punishments to be suffered both in soule and bodie are prepared for those that are not affraid to denie christ and his trueth that god is intent and readie to gouerne vs that we might make our confession aright that the prouidence of god is not onely generall but also speciall which is diligently occupied about all our smallest matters yes euen the haires of our head redargution those doe erre who thinke it to bee sufficient if in heart they doe embrace the faith and a right opinion concerning religion and that it is at a mans choise in the meane season to graunt or affirme any thing before man as the condition of the place time and persons requireth especially when the life seemeth to be in imminent danger to be lost the epicures erre in that they denie the diuine prouidence because they thinke it too base for the maiestie of god to take care of humane affaires the stoicks doe erre who imagine that all things are gouerned by the fate or an vnresistable amp violent necessitie they doe erre who make chaunce and fortune without any wise ordination of the diuine prouidence the pelagians do erre in giuing more than is due to mans strength as if it were put in mens power to embrace the faith at their pleasure to continue constant in the same and to confesse it to the end without feare they doe erre who doe leane more vpon outward things and inconstant riches than vpon the power and goodnesse of god instruction thou must to the vtmost of thy power labour to haue the true feare of god before thine eyes because thou now hearest that one god is to be feared aboue all man thou must learne such a contempt of humane things as that thou maist alwaies desire hauing forsaken them to depart hence and to bee ioyned together with christ in the heauens the consideration of god speciall prouidence doth cause thee to thinke of the presence of god that beholder to craue his helpe and also to beleeue that thou article helped in all things and finally that there is no danger so terrible but hee both can and will deliuer thee from when it is fit correction these words of christ correct their negligence who in their prayers do not craue of god sincere loue that being inflamed with it they may not refuse to lay downe their life for his name the negligence of those man is also taxed which doe not acknowledge and behold the prouidence of god shewing it selfe in all things those are reproued who giue not god thanks for vouchsafing to gouerne and defend vs and all things that belong vnto vs by his prouidence those are reprooued that abuse the good creatures of god seeing that it is manifest that god hath care of all things thus any place of scripture ought to be handled yet so as that all the doctrins be not propounded to the people but those onely which may bee fitly applied to our times and to the present condition of the church and they must not onely be choice ones but also few lest the hearers bee ouercharged with their multitude of memorie in preaching bbecause it is the receiued custom for preachers to speak memoriter by heart before the people some thing must bee here annexed concerning memory artificial memorie which standeth vpon places and images will very easilie without labour teach how to commit sermons to the memorie but it is not to be approoued the animation of the image which is the key of memory is impious because it requireth absurd insolent and prodigious cogitations and those especially which set an edge vpon and kindle the most corrupt affections of the flesh it dulleth wit and memorie because it requireth a threefold memorie for one the first of the places the second of the images the third of the thing that is to be declared it is not therefore an vnprofitable aduise if he that is to preach doe diligentlie imprint in his mind by the helpe of dsposition either axiomaticall or syllogisticall or methodicall the seuerall doctrines of the place he meanes to handle the seuerall proofes and applications of the doctrines the illustrations of the applications and the order of them all in the meane time nothing carefull for the words which as horace speaketh will not vnwillingly follow the matter that is premeditated uerbaque praeuisam rem non inuita sequentur their studie hath many discommodities who doe con their written sermons word for word it asketh great labour he which through feare doth stumble at one word doth both trouble the congregation and confound his memorie pronunciation action and the holie motions of affections are hindred because the mind is wholly bent on this to wit that the memorie fainting now vnder her burthen may not faile hitherto hath bin spoken of the preparation or prouision of the sermon the promulgation or vttring of it followeth in the promulgation two things are required the hiding of humane wisedome and the demonstration or shewing of the spirit humane wisedome must bee concealed whether it be in the matter of the sermon or in the setting forth of the words because the preaching of the word is the testimonie of god and the profession of the knowledge of christ and not of humane skill and againe because the hearers ought not to ascribe their faith to the gifts of man but to the power of god word corinthian when i came vnto you brother i came not with the eminencie of eloquence or of wisdome declaring vnto you the testimonie of god for i did not decree to know any thing among you but iesus christ and him crucified that your faith should not consist in the wisedome of man but in the power of god if any man thinke that by this meanes barbarisme should bee brought into pulpits hee must vnderstand that the minister may yes and must priuatly vse at his libertie the artes philosophie and varietie of reading whilest he is in framing his sermon but he ought in publike to conceale all these from the people and not to make the least oftentation artis etiam est celare artem it is also a point of article to conceale article the demonstration of the spirit is when as the minister of the word doth in the time of preaching so behaue himselfe that all euen ignorant persons amp vnbeleeuers may iudge that it is not so much hee that speaketh as the spirit of god in him and by him corinthian neither was my speech and my preaching in the perswasiue words of mans wisedome but in the demonstration of the spirit and of power and if all prophecie and there enter in an vnbeleeuer or one that is ignorant hee is reprooued of all be is iudged of all and so the secrets of his hart are disclosed amp so falling vpon his face he willworship god returning word that god indeed is amog you and i wil come vnto you shortlyand i wil know not their non verba sed virtutem words that are puffed vp but their power for the kingdome of god is not in words but in power mich i am filled with power by the spirit of the lord and with iudgement and might to shew iacob his defection and to israel his sinne this makes the ministerie to bee liuely and powerfull luke and it came to passe when he had spoken these things that a certaine woman of the multitude lifting vp her voyce said vnto him blessed is the wombe that bare thee and the breasts that gaue thee sucke this demonstration is either in speech or in gesture the speech must be spirituall and gracious that speech is spirituall which the holy spirit doth teach corinthian which things also we speake not in the words which mans wisedome teacheth but which the holy ghost teacheth comparing spirituall things with spirituall things and it is a speech both simple and perspicuous fit both for the peoples vnderstanding and to expresse the maiestie of the spirit act paul disputed with them three sabbath dayes out of the scriptures opening and shewing that christ must suffer and rise againe gal o yee foolish galatiansto whom iesus christ before was described in your sight and among you crucified corinthian but wee haue cast from vs the clokes of shame and walke not in craftines neither handle we the word of god deceitfullie but in declaration of the trueth wee approoue our selues to euery mans conscience in the sight of god if our gospell be then hid it is hid to them that perish in whom the god of this world hath blinded the mindes that is of the infidel ampc wherefore neither the words of arts nor greeke and latin phrases and quirks must bee intermingled in the sermon they disturbe the mindes of the auditours that they cannot fit those things which went afore with those that follow a strange word hindreth the vnderstanding of those things that are spoken it drawes the mind away from the purpose to some other matter here also the telling of tales and all profane and ridiculous speeches must be omitted the speech is gracious wherein the grace of the heart is expressed luke and all bare witnes of him and wondred at the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth john the officers answered neuer man spake like this man grace is either of the person or of the ministerie grace of the person is the holines of the heart and an vnblameable life which howsoeuer it makes not a minister yet is it very necessarie because the doctrine of the word is hard both to bee vnderstood and to bee practised therefore the minister ought to expresse that by his example which he teacheth as it were by a type pet not as though yee were lord ouer god heritage but that yee may be examples types to the flocke tim be an example to the faithfull both in word and conuersation philipp furthermore brother whatsoeuer things are true whatsoeuer things are honestthinke on these things which yee haue both learned and receiued and heard and seene in me those things doe and the god of peace shall be with you he that is not godly howsoeuer he may vnderstand the scriptures yet doth he not perceiue the inward sense and experience of the word in his heart psalm the lord is good and right therefore he teacheth sinners his way he maketh the meeke to walke in the law and teacheth the meeke his way amos surely the lord god will doe nothing but he reuealeth his secret to his servant the prophets gen and the lord said shall i hide from abraham the thing which i am about to do seeing that abraham shall be indeede the father of a great and mightie nation ampc for i know him that he will command his sonnes and his household after him that they keepe the way of the lord to doe righteousnes and iudgement it is a thing execrable in the sight of god that godly speech should bee conioyned with an vngodly life psalm vnto the wicked god saith what hast thou to doe to declare mine ordinances and to take my couenant into thy mouth seeing thou hatest to be reformed it is a strange sight to see him that is the guide of the way to others to wander out of the way himselfe and to see a physitian of others to be full of botches himselfe in the meane while as nazianzene speaketh it is an ecclesiasticall secret that the minister ought to couer his infirmities that they bee not seene for the simple people behold not the ministerie but the person of y e minister herod heard john baptist willingly not because hee was a good minister but because he was a good man mark well saith in verse nazianzene he that teacheth sound doctrine and liues wickedly reacheth that with one hand which he cleeketh away with the other chrysostom vpon the of matthew saith the doctor of the church by teaching well and by liuing wel instructeth the people how they ought to liue well but by liuing ill he doth instruct god how to condemne him and in his homily in act it is an easie matter to shew wisedome in words teach me to liue by thy life this is the best teaching for words make not such an impression in the soule as workes doe a minister that is wicked either openly or secretly is not worthie to stand before the face of the most holy and the almightie god ier therefore thus saith the lord if thou returne then will i bring thee againe and thou shalt stand before me isai then flew one of the seraphims vnto me with an hot coale in his hand which hee had taken from the altar with the tongues and hee touched my mouth and said loe this hath touched thy lips and thine iniquitie shall bee taken away and thy sinne shall bee purged also i heard the voyce of the lord saying whom shall i send and who shall goe for vs then i said here am i send me leuit then moses said to aaron this is that which the lord said i will be sanctified in them that come neere vnto me and i will bee glorified before the sight of all the people and hence it is that the iudgements of god remaine for wicked ministers to tremble at sam therefore the sinne of the young man was very great before the lord for man abhorred the offer of the lord ampc ver they obeyed not the voyce of their father because the lord meant to slay them the parts of sanctitie are especially a good conscience corinthian for our reioycing is this the testimonie of our conscience that in simplicitie and godly sinceritie and not in fleshly wisedome but by the grace of god wee haue had our conuersation in the world timothie keeping faith and a good conscience which some hauing put away as concerning the faith haue made ship wreck act and herein i endeauour my selfe to haue alway a cleere conscience towards god and towards man if this bee wanting the mouth of the speaker is shut isai their watchmen are all blind they haue no knowledge they are all dumbe dogges they cannot barke they lie and sleepe and delight in sleeping an inward feeling of the doctrine to be deliuered wood that is capable of fire doth not burne vnles fire be put to it and he must first be godly affected himselfe who would stirre vp godly affections in other man therefore what motions a sermon doth require such the preacher shall stirre vp priuatly in his owne mind that hee may kindle vp the same in his hearers the feare of god whereby being throughly strucken with a reuerent regard of god maiestie hee speaketh soberly and moderately the loue of the people thess but were gentle amogst you as a nurse that cherisheth her children and that this affection may appeare the ministers dutie is to pray seriously and feruently for the people of god sam god forbid that i should sin against the lord and cease praying for you the minister must also be venerable that is such a one as is to be reuerenced for constancie integritie grauitie and trueth speaking who also knoweth how to performe reuerence to others either priuatly or publikely as is befitting the persons of all his hearers hee must bee temperant who restraineth inwardly his ouer vehement affections and hath his outward fashions and gestures moderate and plaine by the which dignitie and authoritie may bee procured and preserued therefore hee must be neither couetous a louer of siluer nor a follower of wine nor litigious nor a striker nor wrathfull and let the young man exercise themselues to godlines and flie the lusts of youth tim the grace of the ministerie is to be apt to teach timothie now pauls meaning is that it is not only decent and laudable if this gift be had but also that it is so necessary as that may not be wanting for this consideration nazianzene refused a bishopric and theophylact vpon this place saith that this dutie of teaching is especially of all other necessarie to be found in bishops in the nicene and miletian councell this was imposed in stead of a punishment to hold the name of a minister but not to preach the gospell authoritie whereby he speaketh as the embassadour of the great iehouah tit these things speake and exhort and rebuke with all authoritie pet if any man speake let him speake as the oracles of god zeale whereby being most desirous of god glory he doth endeuour to fulfill and execute the decree of election concerning the saluation of man by his ministerie iob i an full of matter and the spirit within me compelleth me behold my bellie is as the wine which hath no vent and like the new bottels that brast tim instructing themprouing if god at any time will giue them repentance that they may know the trueth column admonishing euery manthat wee may present euery man perfect in christ iesus gesture is either in the action of the voyce

act and peter standing with the eleuen lift vp his voyce and said in the doctrine hee ought to bee more moderate in the exhortation more feruent and vehement let there be that grauitie in the gesture of the body which may grace the messenger of god it is fit therefore that the trunke or stalke of the bodie being erect and quiet all the other parts as the arme the hand the face and eyes haue such motions as may expresse and as it were vtter the godly affections of the heart the lifting vp of the eye and the hand signifieth confidence chronicle salomon made a brazen scaffold and set it in the

grauest ministers in this kind be in stead of a rule of conceiuing of prayer hitherto hath bin spoken cocerning preaching of the word it remaineth now to speake of the conceiuing of praiers which is the second part of prophecying whereby the minister is the voyce of the people in calling vpon god luke one of his disciples said vnto him lord teach vs to pray as john also taught his disciples sam

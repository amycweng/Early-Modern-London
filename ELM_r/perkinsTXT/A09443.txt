the reuelation of iesus christ which god gaue vnto his servant things which must shortly be done which he sent and showed by his angell vnto his servant john before wee come to the words wher in is contained singuler mater fit for the time amp age this question must be handled whether this booke of the reuelation be canonical scripture for some haue heretofore as also in our time called the authority of it in question but we are without all doubt to resolue our selues that it is canonical scripture of equal authority with the rest of god book our reasons be these first the doctrine contained in this booke is apostolicall as any shall perceiue which seriously reads the same secondly the stile of this booke is apostolicall that is plaine simple and easie if we consider that the matter thereof is propheticall thirdly this booke hath bene approued and receiued for canonicall by the common consent of god church in all ages since the dayes of john and was neuer refused of any whole church but onely of some priuate man fourthly the things foretold in this booke came to passe as they were foretold as among the rest in one for all may appeare by the prophesie of the two beast whereof one came out of the sea the other out of the earth chap the one prefigured the romane empire the other the hereticall apostaticall church of rome both which in all things are come to passe in these latter ages answerable to the prophesie the contrary reasons brought to improue the authoritie of this booke are of no moment reason john nameth himselfe sundry times in this booke whereas in penning the gospell he did not once mention his own name though he had iust occasion so to do therefore it was not penned by john but by some other and published afterward in iohns name answer the reason is not good for there is great difference betweene an historie and a prophesie the gospell of john is an historie of christ now there is no necessarie reason why one man penning the history of another should name himselfe but this booke of the reuelation is a prophesie in penning whereof it is more requisite the prophet should put to his owne name so did the former prophets ieremy mentioneth his name in his booke at least an hundred times so doth isay and daniell almost in euerie chapter then seeing they do it so often it is no maruell if s john repeat his name fiue sundrie times in this whole booke they obiect that his stile in this booke is not the same with that he vsed in the penning of the gospell ans the difference of the stile ariseth from the difference of the matter seeing there he writes an historie here he pens a prophesie againe he writes not his owne words but those which hee receiued from christ by particular reuelation they say this booke hath bene reiected in diverse ages as not canonicall ans it cannot be proued that it was euer refused of any whole church but of some particular man now the disallowing of any priuat man cannot make a whole booke to be reiected for then the epistles to the hebrewes of iames and of john should not be canonicall which yet be receiued of all churches for the pure word of god now come to the words the reuelation of iesus christ which god gaue vnto him ampc these three first chapters consist of two parts a preface and a vision the preface is an entrance to the vision contained in the beginning of the first chapter from the first verse to the ninth the vision it selfe is set downe in the rest of these three chapters the preface hath two parts first the title of the booke secondly the inscription thereof the title in the three first verses the inscription from the fourth to the ninth verse the title in these words the reuelation of iesus christ ampc a reuelation is nothing else but a manifestation or discouerie of things secret in respect of man for the common good of the church and so this word is taken in this place reuelations from god in scripture were shewed three wayes first by dreames secondly by vision thirdly by created voyce of god face to face as we may see number now this was not by dreame nor by vision or voice alone but it is a mixt reuelation receiued partly by vision and partly by voyce vttered in the vision from the lord in the three first verses this reuelation is described by seuen arguments first by the author secondly the end thirdly the persons to whom it was directed fourthly the matter fiftly the instruments sixtly the maner of deliuering it seuenthly the fruit of the reuelation first the author is iesus christ it comes from him and it is called his reuelation in these respects first not to exclude the father and the holy ghost but to shew the speciall office of christ the second person in trinitie which is to reueale to publish and to manifest the will of god the father to his church and for this cause he is called the mal angell of the couenant the ma doctor of the churh the corinthian wisedom of the father amp the ioh word of god secondly it is called the reuelation of iesus christ to teach vs to put difference betweene this and all satanicall reuelations for as god hath his true reuelations so sathan who herein may be called god ape hath his counterfeit visions and deliuers them in shew like to god but they differ much first the diuels reuelations be for the most part ambiguous doubtfull and vncertaine in speech and phrase so as a man cannot tell which way to take them but the reuelations which come from christ the author of truth who knoweth all things and the reasons of them are certaine and in plaine termes deliuered secondly the diuell sheweth his visions to none but to the wicked and bad man that be his instruments but the lord chuseth the godly which feare his name and to them he reuealeth his secrets as to john in this place thirdly the diuels reuelations euermore tend to set vp and vphold heresie wickednesse apostacie and idolatry deut but these that come from god serue to erect and maintaine truth according to godlinesse euen pure apostolicall doctrin and the sincere worship of god thirdly it is called the reuelation of christ to shew vnto vs his speciall kingly office in heauen for being ascended and exalted to the throne of maiestie he sitteth at the right hand of his father far aboue all principalitie and power might and domination and there doth direct rule and gouerne his church vpon earth according to the good pleasure of his will for all these visions serue to direct his church in their obedience to his command whereas christ iesus is author of this reuelation and after his ascention and exaltation giues the same vnto his church we may obserue his constant care ouer his church in this last age of the world before his incarnation euen from the beginning he gaue vnto his people such doctrine of faith and manners as was needfull for their saluation and still som time to time reuealed such prophesies of things to come as were meete for them to know and now behold the continuance or rather the increase of this his care in the new testament for beside the perfection of the former prophesies and the full manifestation of his blessed will by his euangelists and apostles for all things needful to be beleeued and done vnto eternall life loe here is added the reuelation of this worthie prophesie concerning things to come for the great good and comfort of his children to the end of the world which god gaue vnto him these words be added to shew how this became the reuelation of christ namely by the gift of god that is of god the father the first person in trinitie for this is a rule to be obserued that where the title god in any sentence of scripture is opposed to christ there it importeth the first person the father though this bee also true that sundry times in scripture the father alone is tearmed god without any addition of the other persons because he is the first in regard of order and the fountaine of the deitie for the son receiueth the godhead by communication from the father and the holy ghost receiueth it from them both but the father hath his godhead of himselfe and receiueth it not by communication from any other here some will say this seemes strange that any thing should be giuen to christ seeing he is god and hath all things of himselfe answer we must conceiue of christ two wayes first as god secondly as mediator and head of the church as christ is god the father giueth him nothing for so he is of himselfe the same with the father and hath all things belonging vnto him that the father hath excepting personall properties and is no way inferior to the father neither receiueth any thing from him but giueth all things as well as the father doth but yet as christ is mediator hee is not god simply but god incarnate or god made man and so is said to receiue of his father in respect of his manhood as himselfe confesseth all power is giuen to me matth and paule sayth god gaue him a name aboue all names philip hee receiued of his father the promise of the holy ghost sayth peter act and god made him both lord and christ ver and so god gaue him this reuelation in this place if it be said this makes christ inferiour to his father for the receiuer is vsually inferiour to the giuer answer as christ is god he is equall with the father but as he is mediatour god incarnate and made man he is inferiour and receiueth of him so much himselfe confesseth my father which gaue them mee is greater than all john and in the same respect paule calleth god the father the head of christ corinthian and as christ now sitteth at the right hand of his father being mediator and ruler of his church he is inferiour to his father and receiueth his kingdome from his father which he must giue up at the last day corinthian and here we must consider in what manner god giues his reuelation to his son first therefore christ iesus as he is mediator is made lord of this reuelation so as hee may say it is his owne right and royaltie being a part of that law whereby his church is now gouerned whereof he is lord and king againe this reuelation was reuealed vnto christ as he is man before it was euer knowne to any creature man or angell by reason of the vnion of his manhood with the godhead in this which hath been said we may obserue that this booke of the reuelation is christ his right and belongeth vnto him as his owne royaltie and priviledge for as the lawes in any kingdome belong to the prince thereof and are called his lawes alone and no mans els so this booke being a part of that law whereby christ gouerneth his church is his royaltie alone for god gaue it him and he hath by his angell sent it to his church and that which is here said of this booke must be vnderstood proportionally of all other books of holy scripture christ is made lord of all and they are all of them his royalties and possessions and from hence will follow necessarily first that no man in the world hath authoritie aboue this booke or any other part of canonicall scripture indeed monarchs and princes haue great authoritie and preheminence in their dominions ouer all persons and ouer all causes of man but in the church they with all others owe homage vnto christ there hee hath the canonicall scriptures to be his laws whereto euery one must subiect himselfe the dispensation of the word and the adminis ration of the sacraments bee his royall ordinances ouer which none may dare to claime rule or authoritie for so should the scriptures haue beene giuen vnto them for their prerogatiues as they were to christ but god gaue them to him alone and hee disposeth thereof as pleaseth him and therefore the pope in taking vpon him to dispence with the word and to mangle the sacraments doth herein steppe into the roome of christ and so declare himselfe to be that man of sinne by seeking to rob him of that princely royaltie which belongs to him alone secondly that the soueraigne power and authoritie of expounding scripture belongeth to christ alone and to none other with him true it is that man hath a ministerie committed vnto him by vertue whereof he may expound scripture by scripture but man haue no power of themselues to determine of the proper sence of scripture and therefore the popish practise in giuing to the church absolute authoritie to determin of the sence of scripture of themselues without scripture is flat robbery against christ for therein they giue vnto man that soueraigne power which is proper to christ thirdly herein wee obserue the excellencie of this booke and of the whole scripture of god for all of it is the gift of the father to the son and of the son vnto his church the like cannot bee said of any writings of man whatsoeuer bee they neuer so excellent herein the scriptures surpasse them all whereby we are taught to esteeme more reuerently of the scriptures of god than of all the writings of man in the world here then behold the sinne of this age which more delighteth to speake and heare the sayings of man in the publicke ministerie than the glorious word of the euerliuing god whereas the writings of man be full of darkenesse of errour and deceit but the word of god is most holy and pure and euery way perfect proceeding wholly from the father of lights vnto his beloued son who hath faithfully dispersed the same for the good of his church to shew to his servant things that must shortly be done these words containe the second third and fourth arguments whereby this reuelation is described viz the end of it the persons to whom it must be shewed and the matter which it containeth arg ii the end of this reuelation is to shew that is to make knowne and manifest things to come for the good of the whole church whence we may obserue that the papists erre exceedingly in debarring lay people as they call them from the reading of the scripture for the end of this booke is to make manifest to god servant things to come and who are god servant are the cleargie onely and not lay people also god forbid the lay man is christ his servant as well as one of the cleargie and therefore it is god will that he should learne to know and vnderstand this booke like one of his servant and here consider that if this booke of scripture which is hard and difficult must be learned of the lay man then much more must he search into all other bookes of god which bee more plaine and easie as the history of gospell epistles ampc arg iii the persons to whom it must be shewed viz the servant of christ this reuelation was not giuen of god for all man indefinitely but for all his servant that is such alone as repent of their sinnes and truly beleeue in christ for the pardon of them and shew forth the same by new obedience so hee teacheth elsewhere the secret of the lord is with them that feare him and his covenant to giue them vnderstanding psalm the lord will reueale his secret to his servant the prophets amos and god will not keepe backe from abraham the thing hee was to doe vnto sodome and gomorrah because hee knew abraham would doe his will and teach his familie after him genes verse the consideration whereof should admonish vs not to content our selues with the bare hearing of the word and outward participation of the sacraments but to labor principally to become god servant and to shew the same by the practise of that which we heare hereby shall wee receiue instruction from the lord and grow in knowledge dayly more and more our vnderstandings shall more easily conceiue the will of god for they that will doe the will of his father shall know his doctrine john here then is the cause why most hearers after long teaching profit little but remaine as blind and ignorant as euer they were euen their owne impietie they liue in their sinnes and labour not to become god servant secondly in this argument we may obserue that christ iesus is true god for here he is made the head of the church euery true beleeuer is his servant and he his lord the angels of the churches be his angels as after we shall see which prerogatiue none can haue but he that is true and very god thirdly in this argument are those confuted which hold that god would haue all to bee saued and cals all man without exception for if hee called all effectually then hee would offer the meanes to all to wit his holy word that so they might bee called to the state of g ace this he doth not for as wee see this booke is giuen not to all but to his servant and that which is said of this booke is true of the whole scripture the lord shewed his word sayth dauid not to all the world but to iacob that is his people with whome hee made a couenant psalm the fourth argument whereby this reuelation is described is the matter thereof viz things which must shortly bee done that is things to come whereby in generall we may obserue a difference of this booke from the rest of holy scripture which treats of things present or past this being a prophecie of things to come the matter of this booke is described by two arguments first by the necessitie of these things to come they must be done secondly by the circumstance of time when shortly or quickly for the necessitie of these things they be such as must needs be done so speaketh the holy ghost elsewhere of sundry things to come of offences it must needs be that offences should come mat of heresies there must bee heresies in the church corinthian and of afflictions through manifold afflictions we must enter into the kingdome of heauen act and they that will liue godly in christ iesus must suffer persecutions timo h from whence i gather that things which come to passe concerning god church and the enemy thereof doe come to passe necessarily this doctrine must be well obserued for though it be the truth of god yet the reason of man will not agree vnto it for some will say if all things come to passe necessarily then in their actions and proceedings man haue no free will for necessitie and libertie of will cannot stand together answer they may indeed constraint and mans free will cannot stand together but mans will and vnchangeable necessitie may well accord as i shew thus in god there is most absolute freedome of will yet he doth many things of necessitie as he willeth that which is good necessarily for he cannot possibly will that which is euill and yet he willeth the same most freely so christ died necessarily he could not but die if we consider the counsell of god and yet he died most freely for he laid downe his life of himselfe and no man tooke it from him john it will be said againe if things come to passe by necessitie then it is in vaine to vse any meanes for the effecting of them for god will must be done do we what we will answer this is mans corrupt reason these man must consider that as god hath appointed what things must come to passe so he hath appointed the meanes how they shall bee effected and seeing the lord hath appointed as well the meanes as the end wee should by this necessitie rather be induced to vse the meanes than any way moued to neglect the same to make this more plaine wee must know there is a double necessitie one is absolute another in part i call that absolute necessitie which cannot be otherwise possibly as that god liueth and cannot die is omnipotent infinite ampc necessitie in part is when any thing done is necessarie onely because it depends on necessarie causes as fire to burne is necessarie in regard of that order which god hath set in nature by creation yet this necessitie is not absolute for fire would not burne if god should please to change that order set in nature as he did when the three children were cast into the hot fierie ouen daniel now whereas wee say things to come must necessarily be done it must bee vnderstood of necessitie in part and not of absolute for in themselues they be changeable and contingent and necessarie only in regard of god decree appointing them which is vnchangeable in regard whereof all things to come bee necessarie and yet we may not thinke that the vnchangeablenesse of god decree doth take away freedome from mans will it onely inclines the same to one part amp so disposeth that man should freely will that to bee which god eternally hath decreed the second thing whereby the matter of this booke is set out vnto vs is the circumstance of time when these things must be done shortly must be well obserued and howsoeuer some things foretold were not to be done till many hundred yeares after which space of time might seeme verie long yet in two respects it is but short first in regard of god to whom a thousand yeares are but as one day pet secondly in regard of man to whome a hundred or two hundred yeres seeme but a short time when once they bee expired though before they seemed long this circumstance of time is set down for two causes first to terrifie all carnal and carelesse man for this booke foretelleth iudgements plagues and destructions for the enimies of god church which m st shortly come vppon them which is a thing worthy our carefull consideration in this secure age of the world wherein man blesse themselues in their sinnes without fear of god iudgements and say they shall haue peace though they walke after the stubbornenesse of their owne hearts putting farre from them the euill day saying spare thy selfe this shall not come vnto thee but shall the lyon rore and the beast not tremble yet the lord threateneth his iudgements but man will not repent well let vs consider this whether we be young or old high or low that god iudgements are shortly to come and let this bee a motiue to raise vs out of the sleepe of sinne and of securitie that which peter said of false teachers is also true of all impenitent sinners vnlesse they preuent the same by speedie and unfained repentance their iudgement long agoe is not farre off and their damnation sleepeth not pet secondly this circumstance of time serueth greatly to comfort the servant of christ and to furnish them with all patience and long suffering vnder any aduersitie or distresse that may befall them in bodie or mind or both indeed many are brought to impatience and distrust by afflictions and crosses but the child of god in such a case must call to mind what the holy ghost hath here set down concerning the prophecies of this booke which foretell deliuerance for god church and for euerie member thereof namely that they must shortly be brought to passe yet a very little while and hee that commeth for their deliuerance will come and will not tarrie hebr verse thus much for the matter of this reuelation now followe the instruments whereby the lord doth conuay the same vnto his church which is the first argument whereby it is described in these wordes which hee sent and shewed by his angell vnto his servant john where two points must be obserued first the action of christ which is the ground of their imploiment secondly the persons imploied therein as his instruments for the first christ sent and shewed this reuelation this action of christ is noted by the holy ghost for two speciall causes first to shew that s john did not pen and publish this booke rashly but by calling and warrant from god this teacheth vs what must be our behauiour in all our actions whatsoeuer we take in hand we must looke we haue warrant from god for the doing of the same by vertue of our calling and with out this we should not dare to enterprise any thing if this dutie were practised there would be more conscience of the seruice and worship of god and more care of iust dealing with man then there is in the affaires of this life secondly this action of christ is noted to get more reuerent acceptance and greater authoritie to this booke for which cause also it was sent by an holy angell if an earthly prince should write his letter to his subiect and withall send it by one of his guard we doubt the subiect would receiue it most reuerently behold this booke is the epistle and letter of iesus christ sent by his angell for the benefit of his church what reuerence therefore and acceptation ought this to find surely a thousand fold more with euery one then the writing of any earthly prince whatsoeuer the second point to be obserued is the persons whom christ imployeth about this reuelation and they be two an holy angell and saint john for the first it hath pleased god in all ages to vse the ministerie of angels as a meanes whereby hee would conuey the knowledge of his will vnto his church the law in mount synai was giuen to moyses by the ministerie of an angell act gal and daniell receiued the exposition of sundry dreames and visions by an angell daniel and and and the seuen visions which conteine the substance of this booke were shewed to john by an holy angell but here we must take heed that we do not like the papists ground hereupo the inuocation of angels because they be about vs and bring vnto vs particular messages from the lord for before we may pray vnto them wee must haue from god a particular commandement so to do and also a promise to be heard in that wee aske or else our prayer is not of faith but the whole scripture affoords no word of command or promise for any such action and therefore we cannot do it without sinne the second instrument here imployed by christ is john this john was son to zebedeus and so kinsman vnto christ a blessed apostle and euangelist which penned one of the gospels and the three epistles which beare his name this was that disciple whom iesus loued and to procure the more credit and reuerence to this booke he describeth himselfe by two arguments first by a propertie calling himselfe christ his servant secondly by an effect or action in bearing record to god word verse for the first note that john doth not call himselfe that disciple whom iesus loued nor the kinsman of christ which he might haue done being allied vnto him for iohns mother was sister to ioseph christs supposed father and cosin german to the virgin mary john had learned of christ himselfe that the earers and doers of the will of his father were esteemed more deere and neere vnto him than any bond of outward allyance could possibly make them math luke but he cals himselfe christs servant hauing yeelded vp himselfe to do his will for herein stands the dignitie of a christian to do seruice vnto christ the blessed virgine had neuer found such fauour with god to haue beene christs mother if she had not withall become christs servant she bare him in her heart by faith as well as in her wombe by conception or else she had neuer beene saued by him hence we learne that outward dignities as bloud royall noble parentage and such like will nothing further a mans saluation he that would bee acceptable vnto christ must become his servant by beleeuing his word and doing his will hauing cast off the old man which is corrupt and put on the new man which after god is created in righteousnesse and true holinesse so paul saith circumcision is nothing and vncircumcision is nothing but keeping the commandements of god corinthian and henceforth know i no man after the flesh but if any man be in christ he is a new creature corinthian againe consider in what regard john is here called the servant of christ not onely for that he beleeued in christ and obeyed his will as all true christians do but more specially because hee was an apostle and did seruice vnto christ in the worke of his ministerie which was his particular calling so paul writing to the romans calleth himselfe an appostle amp servant of christ cap and he rendreth a reason thereof verse because hee did seruice vnto him in preaching the gospell hence we are taught that we must not onely shewe our selues christs servant in our generall calling of christianitie but especially in our particular callings and offices after the example of christs blessed apostles it is a good thing to professe seruice vnto christ by hearing his woord receiuing his sacraments and keeping his saboathes but vnlesse therewithall we shewe the power of godlinesse in our particular callings our outward profession is flat hypocrisie this magistrats ministers husband wife parents children maisters servant buyer seller and euerie one in his lawful calling should carefully obserue for vnlesse in the particular duties of their speciall callings as the magistrat in the duties of a magistrat ampc they do seruice vnto christ their publicke seruice in the outward duties of religion shall neuer commend them vnto god be it neuer so glorious micha here is the second argument whereby john describeth himselfe namely by this action or effect in bearing record to the word of god for partly by writing the gospell and partly by preaching hee bare witnesse and testified that the word of god was true and because the word of god hath diverse parts the law and the gospell he shews in the next words that hee meanes especially the gospell adding and of the testimonie of iesus christ that is of those things which iesus sayd and did and that no man might cal into question the truth of his testimonie hee professeth himselfe to haue bene an eye witnesse of all those things whereof he bare record saying and of all those things which he saw and here he alledgeth his testimonie to the gospell to proue himselfe a faithfull pen man of this booke that so it might haue more reuerence for hee which was faithfull in penning the gospell of christ the same also is faithfull in penning this prophesie of the church in this testimonie we may obserue that the doctrine of god word is an infallible marke whereby to know the true prophet of god and also to distinguish h m from all false prophets god foretold his people that false prophets should come among them for their triall deut but how shall they discerne them surely by their doctrine for though they shew wonders yet if their doctrine tend to draw man f om the true god to idolatry they are false prophets and should die when our sauior christ was asked by what authoritie hee did those things luke he approoued his authoritie by the testimonie of john who bare witnesse of him john and confirmed the calling of john by the truth of his doctrine which themselues being witnesses was from heauen luke ver hereby then we see the error of the papists who teach that the onely note of a true prophet is to confirme his doctrine by a miracle and that hee which cannot doe so is a false prophet but this note of difference is not true for false prophets may confirme their lying vanities by signes and wonders as we may see deut and so doth antichrist thess the sixt argument by which this reuelation is described is the order and man r of propounding it to the church and it stands in foure degrees first god the father giueth it to christ the mediator and head of the church secondly christ giueth it to an angell thirdly the angell conueyes it to john the apostle fourthly john di ected and assisted by the holy ghost deliuereth it to the churches now as this particular booke was so no doubt all other holy scriptures were conueyed to the church from whence we may obserue first the constant loue of god to his children by this his special care in propounding and deliuering his will and word to his church secondly that this booke and so all other parts of holy scripture are in their kind most perfect and excellent thirdly that the church of rome blasphemeth in calling the written word of god a dead letter and dumbe iudge matching generall councels with it for authoritie and teaching that the vniuersall consent of the church is about scripture f r terpretation and giues life and sence thereto which otherwise of it selfe were but an inckie letter and dumbe word here is the seuenth and last argumet whereby this reuelation is described to wit the fruit effect and the profit which comes of it euen true happrnesse this prophesie concerneth the present and future state of the church the reading and hearing whereof ioyned with carefull keeping bringeth with it true blessednesse that is fellowship with god and life euerlasting in this argument we may obserue first the end of this booke and so of all other bookes of scripture viz o bring man to happinesse to fellowship with god and life euerlasting these things were written saith s john that yee might beleeue that iesus is the christ and so beleeuing might haue eternall life john againe hee declared to them the word of christ that by it they might haue fellowship with god the father and with his son iesus christ john in which fellowship is true happinesse christ himselfe sayth search the scriptures for in them you thinke to haue eternall life john and in this they differ from all other bookes and writings of man for mens writings bee penned either by the light of nature and so be erronious and misse the end of true happinesse or els they be penned by them which haue direction from the word and so all the truth they haue leading to true happinesse is borrowed hence when as the scriptures of themselues doe directly guide man thither from the consideration of this blessed end of holy scripture wee may obserue first that the opinion and practise of the church of rome is damnable who barre the people of god from reading and hearing the scriptures in their vulgar tongue for in depriuing them of this meanes as much as in them lieth they barre them of their saluation and they doe directly crosse the purpose of s john who doth therefore pronouce him blessed that shall heare and reade this booke with conscience to keep and obey it that he might allure and draw al man to doe it with delight secondly we are hereby admonished with all care and diligence to reade and meditate in god word that place before named is most excellent search the scripture john euen as wee would search for gold or some precious thing which we would fain find so the word imports and he addeth the reason for in them you thinke to haue eternall life the same is wisdomes counsell prou but some will say i cannot reade i was neuer brought vp in learning and therefore i cannot search s john cuts off his excuse in the next wordes saying blessed he is also which beares the wordes of this prophecie as if he should say though hee cannot reade yet if hee heare and keepe it he is blessed here then i the dutie of those which cannot read the scriptures they must procu e others to reade vnto them and by hearing and keeping they shall be blessed thirdly by this scope and end of scriptures wee must learne to carrie in mind this plaine difference between the bookes of god and writings of man god word bringeth a man which keep it to happinesse but mans writings of themselues cannot doe so vnlesse they haue light from the word of god if this distinction were imprinted in our harts we should not bee so delighted as many are to heare or speak the words of god mixed with the wordes of sinfull man specially in the publicke ministerie in former times the lord forbad his owne people to sowe their field with mingled seede to make them garments of diverse things as of linnen and woollen leuit and no doubt the same god doth mislike that the pure seed of his word should be mingled with the sayings of erroneous and sinfull man when the same is sown vpon the furrowes of mens hea ts secondly in this seuenth argument wee may obserue the right manner and way of hearing and reading the scriptures a point worthie all serious consideration i stands in two things first we must set downe with ourselues a certaine end why we reade and heare the scriptures which is that we may attaine to true happinesse standing in fellowship with god and life euerlasting this end must bee the motiue to induce vs to heare and reade the word of god and when this ta es place in our hearts it wil be of force to make vs reade and heare with care and conscience which beseemeth god word secondly wee must keepe in mind the things wee reade or heare so fayth the text and keepeth the things which are written which word imports that by diligent obseruation wee should lay them vp in our hearts this is a weightie dutie and seriously commended vnto vs of god bind vp the testimonie seale vp the law among my disciples isay and marie is therefore commended because she kept in her heart the words of iesus luke it was dauids practise i haue id thy saying in my heart psalm and hereto endeth christs encouragement pronouncing them rather blessed which heare the word and keepe it than those which bare christ and gaue him sucke luke and iames calleth it the ingraffed word iames because it should abide in our hearts like a syence in a stock and neuer be remooued but there grow and fructifie vnto life eternall now because this is a point of great difficultie and the want hereof the cause of so little profiting after much hearing and reading i will therefore shew how by god grace in hearing and reading the word of god a man may keepe the same in memorie first a man must learne the grounds or elements of religion commonly called the catechisme for they are the foudation of all knowledge without which a man shall neuer vnderstand the scripture to his comfort nor keepe the same in memorie the apostle sayth the hebrewes were dull of hearing the deepe things of god in christ because they had not well learned the first principles of the word hebr this all ignorant persons should well obserue specially the aged that they may find in themselues the cause of their ignorance and dulnesse euen want of knowledge in the catechisme they thinke it a disgrace to bee brought vnto it now they are old but if they would not be euer learning and neuer come to the knowledge of the truth they must lay in themselues this good beginning and learne the principles of religion secondly wee must not rush vpon god holy ordinance but before we either come to heare or reade with reuerence prepare our selues thereto most man at this day vse to prepare theselues before they come to the lord table and so they ought to doe before they come to heare the word for god ordained both for this end to bee meanes to bring man to true happinesse they differ onely in this that the sacraments are the visible and the scriptures the audible word of god at the giuing of the law the people that must eare it were sanctified three dayes before exod and when they did offer sacrifice or eat the passeouer both priests and people must bee sanctified and the same thing for substance must we perform before we come to heare the word of god this preparation stands in two thing first wee must put out of our hearts al by thoghts all delights and cares of wordly affairs and set our hearts as ezra did to seeke the law of the lord ezra secondly we must make our earnest prayers to god that he would open our eyes that wee may see his will soften our hearts and make our eares attentiue as l diaes were and also giue vs grace to embrace his word and keepe it for christ is the onely doctor of the heart by his spirit without whose inward teaching wee can neuer learne vnto saluation thirdly when we are about the holy exercise of god word the frame of our heart should be thus disposed i it must bee an humble heart for the lord resists the proud and giues grace to the humble iam them that be meeke will he guide in iudgement and teach the humble his way psalm a proud heart is so stuffed with selfe loue that there is no room for the word of god to lodge in but the heart that is lowly in it selfe through the conscience of sinne that is the heart in which the lord by his graces will take vp his abode isay ii it must be an honest heart such as hath no manner of purpose to liue in any one sinne whatsoeuer but though it feele corruption in it selfe is resolued to please god in all the wayes of his commandements and that continually such an heart haue the good hearers resembled by the good ground luke as on the contrarie that is a wicked heart which resolueth to cherish though it be but any one sinne whatsoeuer iii it must bee a beleeuing heart the old iewes heard the word but it profited them not because they mingled it not with faith their hearts hebrew where he compares the heart to a vessell in which there must bee both the word and faith these two must be mingled together and then it will be a word of power of life and saluation therefore when we heare the threatenings of the law or the promises of the gospell we must labour to resolue our hearts of the truth thereof but incredulitie wherby man except against the word as not pertaining vnto them is the mother of forge fulnesse the old world knew nothing of the flood because they did not beleeue matth iv it must bee an hearing heart such as is pliable to the word sacrifice and burnt offerings sayth dauid thou wouldest not but mine eares hast thou prepared psalm as if hee should say beside those bodily cares which thou hast giuen me by creation thou hast bored new cares in my heart so as i can by thy grace attend and listen to thy word and when god saith seeke ye my face this hearing heart will answere i seeke thy face o lord psalm verse fourthly after we haue heard or read the word we must become doers of the same euen in the duties of our vocation we see euery man more skilfull in the works of his owne trade by reason of his dayly exercise therein euen so the constant practise of god word will make vs expert in it and cause vs to keepe it in perfect memorie and these are the right meanes to become good hearers and readers of the word of god thirdly this benediction pronouced vpon them that heare read amp keepe the prophecies of this booke serues to induce euery child of god as much as in him lieth to keep in memory the whole word of god but specially these prophecies of things to come that concerne the state of the church for therefore did god reueale them that they might bee remembred when the angell had told daniel the state of the church from his time to the comming of christ hee bids him shut vp the wordes and seale the booke till the end of the time daniel meaning that he for his own comfort should hide them in his heart and christ sayth to his disciples when ye see the abhomination of desolation spoken of by daniell the prophet let him that readeth consider it matth behold i haue told you before meaning things to come verse shewing that hee would haue his children to marke and remember those weightie things that are foretold concerning the state of the church for the time is at hand here is a reason of the former benediction for seeing the time of the accomplishing of this prophecie is at hand amp must shortly be fulfilled therefore those be blessed which reade and keepe the same in memorie and it is an answere to a secret obiection for they might haue said we need not to reade or remember this prophecie seeing it shall not be fulfilled in our dayes but he addeth the time is at hand wherein they must be fulfilled and therefore it must bee marked these wordes for substance were in the first verse where it is said the reuelation was of things that must shortly be done and here they be repeated againe whereby hee would teach vs that these prophecies containe weightie matter to be deepely considered and earnestly thought on and s john repeates the same for two causes first to awake the members of the church out of the sleepe of security and make them stand vpon their watch continually for though they cannot fall into the dead sleepe of sinne yet the slumber of securitie may ouertake the the wise virgines slumber as well as the foolish matth and the spouse of christ the true church confesseth that shee sleepeth though her heart waketh cant secondly to confirme and hearten the church and all true members of christ against the afflictions to come for herein is the common saying true he that is forewarned is fore armed now in these words the time is at hand christ would teach vs to obserue that whatsoeuer thing may befall the members of christ in this life whether afflictions temptations death or the last iudgement it selfe all will come shortly this consideration ought to take place in our hearts being of great vse in our liues as to stay vs from many sinnes so to mooue vs to doe all things with good conscience and the want hereof is the cause of much euill the bad servant beates his fellowes because hee thinkes his maister doth deferre his comming matth the old world went on in sinne neuer regarding noahs prophecie and so knew nothing till the flood came and swept them all away matth we should lay these to our harts and alwayes thinke with paule philipp the lord is at and the rather because wee haue had the gospell and peace with all temporall blessings these eight and thirtie yeares now the state of the church is interchangeable one while peace and then trouble so as it is like this peaceable state will not long continue but we must bee tried and the time of ou triall is at hand for whatsoeuer must befall the church will come shortly we must therefore prepare for trouble and so wee shall finde it the lesse greeuous here beginneth the second part of the preface to wit the inscription of this vision and it hath two branches first a dedication in these words john to the seue churches which are in asia secondly a salutation in the next words grace be with you and peace ampc to the ninth verse in the dedication obserue first the penman that dedicates this booke secondly the parties to whom it is sent for the first the penman is john who here againe repeats his name to shew and certifie euery reader of this booke that he was without al doubt the true penman of the holy ghost in writing this reuelation but though he repeat his name yet he doth not adde any titles of honour or commendation as hee did in the first verse wherein he giues vs a true patterne of modestie and humilitie which is neuer to speake in our owne cause to our owne praise but onely in cases of necessitie when god glory may bee aduaunced and the credit of our particular callings maintained this paule practised who often humbles himselfe and cals himself the corinthian least of all the apostles yes the tim chiefe of all sinners yet when the credit of his apostleship came into question then he sets out himselfe shewing he was a true apostle one of the chiefe and aboue those which did falsely call themselues so as wee may find in both of his corinthian cor epistles to the corinthians secondly the persons to whom hee wrote were the seuen churches in asia concerning them note two things first hee writes to churches secondly to the churches in asia for the first why writes he to the churches rather tha to the church seeing there is but one only catholicke church ans the church may be considered diverse waies first as it is the whole company of the elect amp so it is but one secondly as the same is parted into seuerall branches and company one part being in one countrey and another part in some other wherein also euery seuerall congregation professing the gospell is a particular church and so there may bee many churches all of them beeing members of one catholicke church as the sea is onely one yet it consisteth of many parts which taking their names of the countreyes whereto they adioyne are called so many particular seas as the english sea the spanish sea french italian scottish seas ampc and of particular churches must john bee vnderstood in this place now john chuseth rather to write to churches than to particular man first because the matter of this booke concerneth the church being a propheticall hystorie touching the state of the church to the end secondly because particular churches which bee true members of the catholicke church are the pillars and ground of truth timoth and the church is so called not that her authority is aboue the word but first because it is the treasure house wherein the scriptures are preserued from age to age against the rage of god enemy secondly because the church giues testimonie to the truth of god word and thirdly because it publisheth the truth of god word by vertue of that ordinary ministery which god hath ordained therein secondly in the dedication of this booke among all particular churches god directs him to make choise of those seuen in asia no doubt for speciall cause first because they were then most famous churches as the chapters following and the history of the church doe plainely shew secondly that the calling of the gentiles to the light of the gospell which long before had beene foretold might bee more euident for here the iewes are passed by and the gentiles sent vnto lastly we may here obserue that s john knew no prerogatiue of the church of rome aboue other churches for if it were the mother church whereon al other churches should depend as the papists would haue it i would know of them why john passed by it in the dedication of this booke which containeth matter needfull for al churches to know grace be with you and peace from him which is and which was and which is to come and from the seue spirits which are before his throne here begins iohns salutation of the seuen churches salutations be of two sorts ciuill and religious ciuill is that which man vse ordinarily one to another wishing health welfare and such like religious is that which is peculiar and proper vnto the church comprehending in it a benediction also and such is this here vsed by s john it may also be called apostolicall because it is so vsuall with them in their epistles and they vsed it the rather because it is so correspondent to their ministerie which stood in two things first in preaching which is the ministerie of grace and reconciliation the things here desired secondly in prayer whereto belonged the dutie of benediction to pronounce a blessing vpon the people as did the priests in their ministration vnder the law number and our sauior christ with his apostles when they preached the gospell and as euery minister should doe to his whole congregation before they depart and this is also included in this salutation for hereby they blessed those churches to whom they did write but to come to the words which bee most excellent and containe in them the summe of the gospell grace in scripture signifieth two things first god fauor secondly some gift of god freely bestowed now here by grace is meant not any particular gift of god but the gracious fauor and good will of god whereby he accepts of some in christ for his owne for it is here opposed to peace a gift of grace and therefore cannot signifie the same thing now marke s john in thi salutation begins with grace because it is the foundation of all happinesse and of all god blessings whatsoeuer wee are and all that wee haue is of grace our election redemption vocation iustification and sanctification our faith and repentance amp our perseuerance in the both proceed from this fountain of god free grace it is the beginning and the end of all yes it is all in all in the matter of our saluation first we must haue this and then we may looke for all other blessings and peace peace is taken sundry wayes in the scripture first for welfare amp good successe in things of this world by god blessing exod moyses and iethroe saluting aske each other of their peace that is of his welfare and so it is partly taken in this place secondly for that vnitie and blessed concord which is in the kingdom of god among god children and so it is especially taken here and in this sence it hath six parts euery one wherof is a most worthie blessing the first is peace with god which is when we stand in the fauour of god reconciled to him in christ iesus rom secondly peace with god angels for they guard such as be in god fauour and carrie them as a nurse doth her child in her armes that they hurt not their feete at any stone psalm and they reioyce at our good estate the third is peace with a mans selfe when his conscience will not accuse him but excuse and cleare him being washed in the bloud of christ this is that peace of god which passeth all vnderstanding philip the fourth is peace with god church notably prefigured by the peaceable habitation of wild beast and tame together as the lyon and the calfe the wolfe and the lambe the child and the cockatrice ampc isay and plainely to be seene among the beleeuers acts who were all of one mind and heart the fift is peace with the enemy of god church so farre as it is for the good of the church and the glorie of god so ioseph had peace in pharaohs court so daniell had peace in the court of nabuchadnezzar for when the three children were cast into the ouen wee must not thinke that hee did reuolt vnto idolatry or hide himselfe but being in fauour in the court obtained priuiledge to bee excused the sixt is peace with all the creatures of god with the beast of the field foules of the aire and fish of the sea this the lord promiseth in the couenant that he will make for them with all his creatures hosea verse yes the child of god shall tread vpon the lyon and the serpent and they shall not hurt him psalm verse and this his peace stands herein that by god blessed prouidence hee shall find helpe and comfort from all god creatures in this place whether we take peace for outward welfare or for the concord of god church yet it is placed after grace because it followeth as a fruit thereof first a man must bee in god fauour and then come all the blessings of peace vnto him this then is the meaning grace be with you and peace that is i wish you the fauor of god in christ with peace the blessed fruit thereof euen all outward welfare and especially the concord of god church hauing peace with god with his holy angels with his church with your owne hearts with your enemy as farre as may bee for god glorie and with all his creatures whereas s john wisheth grace vnto the churches in the first place he would teach vs that the fauour of god is to be sought for aboue all things for the apostles practise must be our precept so did dauid many say who will shewe vs any good but lord lift thou vp the light of thy countenance vpon me psalm as if hee should say let the most of the world seeke what they will as riches pleasure ampc yet my desire is of thy loue and fauour aboue all and oftentimes hee calleth god his portion his rocke and castle of defence the thing that be longeth for to shewe that all his ioy was in god fauour and so it should bee with vs but wee little practise this because we bring from our cradles natural presumption which persuades vs that we bee in the fauour and loue of god but wee must cast off this false persuasion and take a new course and labour first to see that we be out of god fauour lost sheepe prodigall childre in our selues yes the very firebrands of hell and this to see our owne want of grace is the first step to grace secondly feeling this want and miserie in our selues we must earnestly desire and in our soules hunger and thirst after the loue and fauour of god in christ aboue all earthly things thirdly we must by the hand of true faith lay hold vpon the grace and mercie of god in christ propounded in the promises of the gospell and apply them to our selues particularly secondly after grace he wisheth vnto them peace where note the true order of seeking for the blessings of this life we must not begin with welfare and prosperitie but our first and chiefest care must be to obtaine the grace and fauour of god so christ bids vs first to seeke the kingdome of god and his righteousnesse for when we are in god kingdome of grace reconciled to him in christ then all things needfull shall bee ministred to vs matth this discouers the bad practise of most man euery where who in seeking the blessings of god begin at the wrong end they will toyle themselues in their callings to get wealth honour pleasures and preferments but the fauour of god in christ is not regarded which notwithstanding is the true and right foundation of all outward welfare here some will say if god giue mee wealth honour and reputation then hee loues me for these be signes thereof i answere these be no sure tokens of his fauour in christ for those that bee his enemy may enioy them all as iob to the this dauid perceiued how the wicked might flourish in their outward prosperitie hauing more than heart could wish psalm and yet they stood but in slipperie places and therefore let no man herewith deceiue himselfe hee that wanteth god fauour in christ is but a cursed wretch and a firebrand of hell though he had all the world for outward things at his commaund for all earthly things seuered from god speciall grace are but an heape of miseries the wicked mans peace is no peace sayth the lord isay and the man that hath god grace in christ though hee want all wordly benefits yet hee hath more than all the world without it for hereby alone hee is truly blessed and happie from him which is and which was and which is to come and from the seuen spirits which are before his throne here is set down the first cause and author of these two grace and peace to wit god himselfe distinguished into three persons the father son and holy ghost the father is noted in these words which is and which was and which is to come the holy ghost in these and from the seuen spirits which are before his throne the son in the fift verse and from iesus christ which is a faithfull witnesse and first begotten of the dead and lord ouer the kings of the earth vnto him that loued vs and washed vs from our sinnes in his owne bloud ampc s john in the first place describes the father by a distribution which expresseth the true nature of god in these words which is was and is to come in which he alludes to that exod where moyses demaunds of god if the people should aske who sent him what he should answere the lord bids him say ehich iehouah hath sent me which two names serue to one end namely to expresse the nature of god they are translated i am and the lord but these english words doe not fully expresse their signification yet s john expounds the here making ehich to signifie him which is which was and is to come which words of john also in the originall be more full in sence than our english tongue can well expresse and yet they may be thus explaned grace and peace be from him which is in himselfe and of himselfe a most perfect and absolute substance which was a most perfect substance and which is to come a most absolute perfect simple substance and essence in these words are touched sundry weightie points first touching the nature of god namely that god is a most absolute perfect substance and essence which hath his being in himselfe of himselfe and from none other paule sayth an idoll is nothing corinthian that is nothing subsisting in nature but a meere fond deuice of mans braine but the true god is an essence subsisting and that of himselfe alone perfectly and herein differeth from all idols and false god secondly hereby we see a difference betweene god and all his creatures euery creature is a substance as angels and man likewise mans bodie and soule are substances yet none of these haue being of themselues but from god and of god and yet wee must not conceiue that the creatures are parts of god though they haue their substances and being of him for then each creature should be god for the communication of the diuine substance cannot be without the diuine nature but god substance is indiuisible and incommunicable to the creature my meaning then is that god made the creatures out of himselfe of that matter which he created by his word and preserueth them beeing made which by the way should teach vs to returne our body and soules by obedience vnto god in lieu of thankfulnesse endeuouring his glory all the daies of our life thirdly hence wee learne that the lord is eternall euery way without beginning or ending for it is hee which is which was and which is to come angels and the soules of man they bee eternall but not euery way though they be eternall in that they shall neuer die yet had they a beginning secondly they are eternall not absolutely but by participation for god made them eternall but the lord is most absolutely of himselfe eternall fourthly note he sayth not from him which shall bee but from him which is to come that is to iudgement to giue vs to vnderstand that this eternall god is also a iudge of all his creatures especially man and angels a point of speciall vse to moue vs to well before god with all good conscience if any shall flat himselfe thinking hee shall bee dead before that day come i answere i may be so what then thinkest th u thereby to escape his iudgement no verily for this god commeth to iudge thee particularly by death and thereby to reserue thee to the iudgement of the great day o that wee could seriously thinke on this it would be a meanes to mooue vs to repentance by breaking of the course of sinne and endeuouring o keepe a good conscience in all things acts and so shall we be readie to meete him at his comming whether by death or iudgement and from the seuen spirits which before his throne these words commonly are expounded of seuen angels of god which stand before the thron and minister vnto him but it cannot be meant of them for two cause a first because and peace is here said to proceed from these seuen spirits but it cannot come from the holy angels which attend to minister before the lord secondly in this verse which is a benediction or a salutation of to the church the seuen spirits are set before iesus christ the second person of the trinitie but there is no reason nor respect for which the angels should bee placed before christ the words are rather thus to be expouded and from the seuen spirits ampc that is from the holy ghost this exposition is most agreeable to all the circumstances of the text and the holy ghost may be called by the name of the seuen spirits for two causes first because though he be onely one in substance yet he is seuen that is manifold in regard of gifts and operations which proceed from him secondly saint john here speaketh of the father son and holy ghost as hee saw them in vision for here he setteth downe one vision which he saw now he beheld the holy ghost in forme of seuen lights in a vision revelation which are before his throne this he speaks by comparison take from earthly kings which sitting in their thrones doe there shew their glorie and maiestie so s john saw in vision god the father sitting in his throne and christ at his right hand and before the throne the holy ghost which manner of appearance proueth not that the holy ghost is inferiour to the father and to the son but hereby is expressed the office of the holy ghost which i to be sent from the father and from the son to the church to enlighten the members thereof this the is the meaning of the words and from the seuen spirits which are before his throne that is grace and peace bee with you from the holy ghost the spirit of the father and of the son who from them both is sent vnto the church to enlighten to sanctifie and to gouern the members thereof first hence we learne that the holy ghost is god for looke from whome commeth grace and peace that same is very god but here grace amp peace proceed from the holy ghost and therefore he is very god secondly wee learne that wee may and ought to direct our prayers to the holy ghost for by whome grace and peace is giuen to him we may direct our prayers but grace and peace are giuen by the holy ghost therefore wee may pray to him for them this is the rather to be obserued because there bee some which doubt whether wee may pray to the holy ghost b t they may as well doubt whether he be god they say we haue no example hereof in scripture ans it is not true for in this benediction john prayeth to the holy ghost saying grace be wi h you and peace from god the father ampc for in substance it is as much s if he had said thus thy grace and peace o father and thy grace and peace o holy ghost and thine o son be with thy church thirdly in this description of the holy ghost by standing before the throne of the father we may obserue that the holy ghost is a person subsisting and not a qualitie some hereticks that acknowledged the godhead of the father denied the godhead of the son and of the holy ghost and concerning the holy ghost haue held that he is nothing but the vertue and qualitie of the father but this is most false for a the father is a substance fitting vpon the throne so here we see the holy ghost is a substance standing before the throne fourthly here we learne that the holy ghost is a distinct person from the father and from the son for hee sitteth not in the throne as doth the father nor sitteth at the fathers right hand as doth the son but standeth before the throne apart from them both that is grace and peace from iesus christ where christ iesus is ioyned with the father and the holy ghost in bestowing grace and peace on his church here some may aske why is christ the second person of the trinitie placed after the holy ghost the third person answer for causes first in regard of his office for christ is to be considered two wayes first as he is the son of the father secondly as he is the mediator of the church as he is the son of the father he is the second person in trinitie and so before the holy ghost in order but as he is mediatour so he is after the holy ghost isay the spirit of the lord is vpon me he hath sent me to preach where christ confesseth himselfe to be sen by the holy ghost as he is mediatour and in that respect he is set after him secondly hee is placed after the holy ghost for the fitter progresse of the hystorie for the manner of them which pen the scriptures is to set them in the last place of who they mean to speak most as matth the euangelist setting downe the genealogie of christ from abraham thogh among them all was none so excellent as christ yet placeth him the last because he intended to goe on with the hystorie of his life and death so john placeth christ the last because hee purposed to make a large description of the person and office of christ which hee could not so fitly haue brought in if he had placed him before the holy ghost from this fift verse till the ninth hee describes christ at large first by his offices secondly by the execution therof his offices are three first his propheticall office in these words which is that faithfull witnesse secondly his priestly office the first begotten of the dead thirdly his kingly office and that prince of the kings of the earth the execution of all his offices is particularly set downe in the words following to him that loued vs and washed vs from our sinnes and so forth to the ninth verse touching his offices in his propheticall office wee may note three things first he is a witnesse secondly a faithfull witnesse thirdly that faithfull witnesse first he is a witnesse isay i gaue him to be a witnesse to the nation by his witnesse earing is signified two duties of his propheticall office first to reueale the will of his father to his church secondly to certifie the church of the certaintie of the same amp in these two stand his whole office propheticall for the first to reueale his fathers will to the church immediately is his office as he is a prophet for none hath seen god but he which came from the bosome of the father and he hath declared him john now christ declares the father by making knowne his will and that he hath done not onely in his owne person while he liued on earth but from the beginning by all the prophets and so will do to the end by all true preachers for in the church the father doth all things by the son when the lord rained fire on sodome gen there iehouah the father rained downe by iehouah the son so when the couenant was made to our first parents it was made in christ the promised seed it was renued to noah abraham and the patriarkes from the father by the son for that iehouah which appeared to moses in the bush exod is by s paule called christ corinthian the prophets and the apostles wrote as they were inspired by christ they were but his instruments to speake and write that he put into them by the holy ghost the matter and the style and phrase of the scripture all came from christ nay when any particular man comes to vnderstand the scriptures this is by the working of christ he opens his eyes hee gaue the disciples vnderstanding as they went vnto emaus to vnderstand the scriptures the second dutie of christs propheticall office is to certifie man in conscience of the truth of his fathers will this certificate is two fold generall or particular generall when he certifieth man in conscience that the word written or spoken by man is the word of god neither nature nor learning can doe this but it is proper to christs propheticall office and for this he sayth to his disciples ioh he will send them the comforter which shall lead them into all truth that is reueale god will vnto them and assure their heart that the same is true vnto this assurance two things are required the outward meanes which is the word it selfe and an inward cause which is the principall to wit the operation of the holy spirit by this doctrine three points are resolued first this demaund of the papists how a man can come to know that the scriptures read and taught be the word of god answer wee must here haue recourse to this faithfull witnesse and desire of him his spirit whereby the mind must bee enlightened and made able to discerne the things of god for naturall man can doe it of himselfe secondly wee must haue christ his testimonie of scripture in the scriptures themselues for in them he setteth downe his testimonie of the scriptures but some will say if christs testimonie of scripture bee set downe in the scriptures why doe not al man know this testimonie and receiue it i answere the shining of the sun before a mans face is not sufficient to cause him to see vnlesse he haue in his eyes the gift and sence of seeing euen so it is not ynough for a man to haue in god word the testimonie of christ that scripture is scripture but withall hee must haue in himselfe the light of the spirit reuealing that testimonie to his conscience and then in reading or hearing the scripture in marking the manner and style the maiestie and power thereof he shall bee able to see in euery sentence the testimonie of christ assuring his conscience that the same is vndoubtedly the word of god a second doubt resolued by this doctrine is this how can a man know the true religion seeing the turke papist iew and protestant haue their seuerall religions and die in them i answere wee must haue recourse to christ this faithful witnesse and looke whereto hee giues his testimonie that we must hold for true religion now the scriptures be as a letter sent from heauen to the church wherein christ hath set downe his owne testimonie of the true religion which in triall shall be found to bee the religion of the protestant and not the religion of iew turke or papist a third doubt to be resolued by this doctrine is how to know the particular truth in matters of religion when as sundry man professing the same religion bee of diverse opinions answer still wee must haue recourse to this faithfull witnesse and prophet of the church he is the iudge of all controuersies in religion and in the scriptures if we marke them we shall see his iudgement quest but if there be diverse opinions about scripture it selfe and euery one giue a seuerall sence vnto it who must then be iudge answer in this diuersitie of opinions yes of the scriptures themselues we must still haue recourse to christ and that in the scriptures alone for though there were a thousand diverse expositions of one place yet by the scope and circumstances thereof conferring it with other like places of scripture a man shall bee able to find out the true sence for christ in the scripture expoundeth himselfe the particular certificate of christ belongeth also to his propheticall office and that is to assure man in their consciences that the promises of the gospell with all the benefits therein contained as iustification sanctification and life eternall which in the word be generally expounded doe belong vnto them particularly as to peter to john ampc and this assurance as the former is principally wrought by the word not barely read but preached for therein by the inward worke of the spirit the generall promises be particularly applied this paule imports saying yee haue the spirit of adoption which testifies with our spirit we be the sonnes of god rom hence we learne that the doctrine of the church of rome and of all others which hold that man cannot bee assured of their saluation by faith is wicked and damnable for hereby they cut off a part of christs propheticall office wherein the dignitie thereof doth consist that is to assure a man particularly of the truth of god promises vnto himselfe and in this he differs from all other prophets and apostles which bee witnesses for they can witnesse onely outwardly to the eare but he can speake and testifie to the conscience neither can any of them certifie any man particularly though their ministerie tend to that end secondly obserue christ is not only a witnesse but a faithfull witnesse and so he is for these causes first because hee testifies not his owne will but his which sent him namely his fathers john secondly he testifies all his fathers wil neither adding thereto nor detracting from it john thirdly because he teacheth his fathers will sincerely in the same maner which hee receiued it not altering changing or deprauing any part therof as my father taught me so i speake these things john thirdly christ is called that faithfull witnesse to distinguish him from all other witnesses the lord hath sundry faithfull witnesses as the prophets apostles the church nay the sun and moone psalm but christ alone is that faithfull witnesse first because his witnesse is authenticall sufficient of it selfe and needs no other confirmation the testimonie of the apostles and prophets is not of it selfe authenticall and certaine but as it consents with christs witnesse and proceedeth from his spirit secondly hee is that witnesse because hee is the lord of that house whereto he giues witnesse namely the church but the apostles and prophets are but servant there hebr thirdly christ his witnesse is inward it speakes directly to the conscience and there giues vndoubted assurance but the witnesse of man as of the prophets and apostles is outward only it comes to the ears it neuer binds and assures the conscience of it selfe and thus wee see why he is called here that faithfull witnesse first whereas christ the doctor and prophet of the church is called that faithfull witnesse we learne that all ministers of the gospell ought to be faithfull witnesses for euery minister of the gospell when he preacheth god word is in the roome of christ and speaketh that vnto the church which christ wold speake that they may be faithfull witnesses sundry things are required at their hands first they must deliuer the testimonie of christ aboue all other things and before all testimonies of man in the office of their ministerie this was meat and drinke to christ to ioh teach his fathers will eleazar abrahams eldest servant shewed his fidelitie in that he would not eate or drinke till hee had done his masters message gen much more ought the ministers of christ haue speciall care of that weightie message committed vnto them secondly they must testifie all the will of god concerning matters of salvation as faith obedience and a godly life among man wee count him a faithfull witnesse which testifies all the truth and no more but the truth so shold it be with all ministers that be god witnesses to his church herein paule cleared himselfe that he was free from al mens bloud seeing he deliuered the whole will of god in matters necessarie for saluation and kept nothing backe thirdly he must neither add vnto or take away much lesse in any case depraue the word of god and this is the true marke of a faithfull witnesse for false prophets teach some truth but withall they adde something of their owne or detract from god truth something that they ought not in the church of rome a man may hear things concerning morall vertues handled soundly but come to iustification and thereto they adde the merit of mens works amp so they deale with faith and repentance matters of saluation they take away one part and adde another to the scriptures they hold the creed in word yet in deed they denie the same as by their doctrine may appeare amp so shew themselues false witnesses fourthly a faithfull witnesse must deliuer the testimonie of christ in that spirituall manner which best beseemeth the maiestie of god and which he best approoueth that is in a plaine easie and familiar kind of speech that the conscience of the sinner may be touched amp the vnderstanding of the simple may be edified when the word is otherwise deliuered as in the entising words of mans wisdom or for ostetation of wit or much reading though nothing be said but the truth yet he that so dispenseth it is an vnfaithfull witnesse because he corrupteth the word by his vaine deliuerie and this is the sinne of this age in many ministers who teach the truth indeed but yet in such sort as it may appeare they seeke theselues and not god glory respecting little the edification of the simple so themselues may bee famous for wit eloquence and learning but these man make marchandise of the word like to huxters that by starching blowing and spicing set a glosse vpon their ware to make it seeme that which it is not which is a greeuous sinne and such as will banish the gospell out of our land vnlesse it be reformed secondly this title of christ that faithfull witnesse doth discouer vnto vs the damnable practise of man in the sinne of vnbeleefe for christ this faithfull witnesse hath giuen testimonie to his word which is preached that the same is true and therefore ioh they that beleeue it not doe make christ a false witnesse and a lyar than which what can be more horrible amp yet this is the common sinne of this age for when the law is applied who is afraid and when the gospell is preached yet who beleeueth our report god ministers may say with the little children wee haue piped vnto you but you haue not daunced we haue mourned vnto you but you haue not wept this deadnesse of heart whereby man are not mooued with the word preached vnto them is an euident argument of this fearfull vnbeleefe whereby they make christ a false witnesse this therefore should moue vs to consider in our selues the heinousnesse of this sinne that so we may striue against it and labour to giue free passage to the word into our hearts trembling at the law and reioycing in the gospell that so each part thereof may haue his perfect worke in vs for which end also wee may consider that amongst those which shall haue their portion in the burning lake vnbeleeuers are set in the first ranke revelation verse thirdly seeing christ iesus is that faithfull witnesse which giueth testimonie to mens consciences in particular of their saluation we learne that euery one which professeth himselfe to repent is bound in conscience to beleeue that the promises of the gospell and the benefits thereof as election redemption iustification sanctification and saluation belong to him particularly and though this be against all humane sence and reason yet seeing we haue a faithfull witnesse auouching the same wee must submit our selues vnto his testimonie for by vnbeleefe we greatly dishonour our witnesse bearer by denying truth vnto his record here then wee see it it no presumption as the papists say to beleeue our election and saluation in particular nay it is an horrible sinne in euery one that repenteth not to beleeue it seeing christ a most faithfull witnesse testifies the same to our consciences by his holy spirit hereto also serue the sacraments instituted by god to seale vp vnto euery worthy receiuer christ and all his benefits the ministers giuing of the bread and wine to them that truly repent is as much as if christ should say beleeue thou and life eternall belongs to thee and the first begotten of the dead in these words is contained the second office of christ namely his priesthood the principall actions whereof stand in dying in rising againe from the dead and making intercession for vs and here s john alludeth to the estate of the families amog the iewes comparing christ to the first borne for as among them hee which was first borne and eldest of the familie had many priuiledges and preheminences aboue his brother as lordship right of the priesthood and double portion ampc so christ he hath his priuiledges yes euen christ crucified hee hath his prerogatiues among the dead aboue all that are dead so paule expounding this title calleth him the first borne and beginning of the dead that hee might in all things haue the preheminence coloss verse the priuiledges of christ dead and buried among all the dead are two first that he was the first that euer rose from death to life and so to glorie some indeed haue risen before christ from naturall death to naturall life as lazarus but it was to die againe and moyses and elijah assumed their body in the mount with christ in his transfiguration but yet they laid them downe againe to the former miserie of corruption for a time but christ iesus ros from death to life eternall neuer to die againe and his resurrection was the first steppe into his glorie secondly that by his owne power he raised vp himselfe and by the vertue of his godhead quickened his manhood the most godly man that is or euer was cannot doe so but all the saints of god are raised from death by vertue of christs resurrection through that mysticall vnion which is between christ the head and all his members by meane whereof the power of christ his godhead which raised vp his manhood is conueyed to all his members in their resurrection fro death to life and therefore is christ called corinthian the first fruits of them that sleepe because as the first fruits of corne which was offered vnto god did sanctifie the whole crop so christ his resurrection did make acceptable vnto god the resurrection of all his members in this title is comprised a notable comfort for all god children against the immoderate feare of death if john had said christ is the first borne among the liuing it had beene a great comfort for then had he shewed that the liuing saint on earth were children in god familie hauing christ for their eldest brother but calling him the first begotten of the dead here is a further comfort the lord sheweth hereby what speciall regard he hath to the faithfull that be dead for euen then when they be dead they continue members of his familie and haue christ iesus dead and buried reckoned among them for their eldest brother in regard whereof christ hath a double right among the dead first of a king secondly of a priest the right of a king hee hath to commaund his members to rise againe and to enter into glorie after him the right of a priest whereby hee offered vp himselfe in death a sacrifice acceptable to god for the sanctifying of the death of all his members for by his death he tooke away the sting of death and hath made it vnto them a sweet sleep in the graue as in a bed of downe out of which they shall one day rise to eternall life and glorie and prince of the kings of the earth here is the third title giuen to christ wherein his kingly office is expressed he is called a prince of the kings of the earth in two respects first as he is god the son of god equall with the father and so is king together with the father and the holy ghost gouerning all things with them by the same diuine power in heauen in earth and in hell secondly as hee is mediatour and redeemer god and man in two natures in this respect hee sayth of himselfe all power is giuen to me in heauen and in earth matth and paule sayth god gaue him a philip name aboue euery name at which euery knee should bow euen as he is mediatour and in this second respect he is called a prince of the kings of the earth in this place now christ being a king must needes haue a kingdome which is not of this world standing in the might and policie of man as earthly kingdomes doe but it is spirituall directly concerning the hearts and consciences of man where he ruleth by his lawes and this is his priuiledge which cannot be giuen to any creature man or angell to rule and raigne spiritually in the heart and conscience this spirituall kingdome of christ is exercised not by dint of sword or force of armes but by his holy word through the worke of the spirit for hee is as a king which carrieth his scepter in his mouth euen his word isay that is the r d of his power by which hee rules the heart and conscience euen in the middest of his enemy psalm verse now christ is here entituled prince of the kings of the earth in two respects first because he and he alone as mediator can giue lawes to bind the consciences of man yes of the greatest monarch in the world secondly because he hath soueraigne power ouer all kings and potentates as well as ouer others to saue and to destroy for not onely hath hee power to make a law to bind their consciences but also if they keepe it to saue them if they breake his law hee hath power to destroy them bee they what they may bee hee hath the keyes of heauen and of hell to open and to shut at his pleasure revelation he can if he will lead them to life and saue them or els leaue them to their owne mind and so destroy them hence arise sundry instructions first seeing our sauiour christ is a prince of the greatest monarchs of the world and is farre aboue them we must then with all feare and trembling reuerence his high maiestie great is that reuerence which man yeeld to earthly princes oh then what reuerence should we performe to him which is prince and lord of all the kings of the earth we cannot conceiue what honour wee owe vnto him which is aduaunced in the throne of all maiestie and this our reuerence wee must shew by hearing his word with trembling and beleeuing hearts as isay sayth cap we must not dare to thinke or speake of christ without great reuerence at his name euery knee must bow that is at the consideration of the great maiestie whereto hee is now exalted euery heart euen of the greatest monarchs should be touched with submission awe and reuerence if this tooke place in mens hearts the name of christ would not bee so prophaned and blasphemed as it is in easting sports in cursing and swearing whereby man tosse it like a ball without all reuerence to so great a prince as is the king of kings secondly seeing he is king of kings wee must giue him absolute obedience princes on earth must be obeyed so far as they commaund in christ but he must be obeyed without exception not onely absolutly and perpetually in all his commaundements but most willingly and freely as it is said his people come freely in the day of assembling psalm man will say they beleeue in christ as he is their sauior but that is not ynough they must obey him also as he is the king of princes many persuade themselues they haue a good faith in christ their sauiour which little regard obedience to him as their king and lord but they deceiue themselues for none can haue christ for their sauiour which haue him not for their lord amp master neither doth that man beleeue in christ which will not striue to doe his will and this our obedience must bee shewed in performing those duties which we heare and learne out of his holy word thirdly seeing christ is king of kings all princes must doe him seruice for they be all inferiour and subiect to him psalm this is the counsell of the holy ghost psalm be wise now o yee kings be learned yee iudges of the earth kisse the son ampc that is inwardly reuerence and outwardly obey him this their homage must bee shewed in all the affaires of their kingdomes they must frame their lawes after the lawes of christ iesus they must shew mercie exercise iudgement keepe courts assises begin end and continue war according to his commaundements and so in euery thing the direction of christ should be their guide as it was to dauid thy lawes o lord haue beene my counsellours psalm fourthly if christ bee soueraigne king then all earthly princes are bound to plant and establish in their kingdomes the religion of christ else how can they shew themselues his loyall subiects many imagine that earthly princes may admit vnto their subiects any religion for the peace of the ciuile state but this is against the equitie of god word in this place for wherein can earthly princes doe homage vnto christ if they maintaine not his religion and their dutie in this behalfe is signified plainely in the parable of the mariage for when they that were bidden did not come the king sent forth his luke servant which may be vnderstood of christian magistrats to compell man to come to the mariage for that is the magistrates dutie in respect of the outward profession of true religion fiftly seeing christ alone is prince of the kings of the earth hence we learne that kings on earth in their dominions are soueraigne gouernours ouer all persons and in all causes next vnder christ he is king of kings absolutely and they are vnder him alone and haue no other head but him whereby wee see the presumption and arrogancie of the pope and sea of rome in claiming supremacie aboue all kings and princes in the whole church vpo earth this is a deuice of the diuell and high treason against christ for hereby hee is robbed of this royall prerogatiue to be the only prince of the kings of the earth lastly seeing christ is king of all kings we must not be discouraged when we be called to suffer any affliction for his truth let the tyrants of the earth rage and bend their force to hurt vs yet wee haue a king aboue them al for whom we suffer he is their king hee can stay and bridle them and if hee please confound and bruise them in peeces they cannot do any thing but that which he permits for hee rules in the middest of all his enemy psalm he can breake them in pieces like a potters vessell thus much of the offices of christ the second part of christs description is by the execution of his offices which consists in foure works the first contained in these words vnto him which loued vs the second in these which washed vs in his bloud the other two in the two verses which follow viz and for the first which loued vs that is john and the churches of asia amp by proportion all other churches being parts of the true church the loue of christ hath three degrees the first is a generall loue wherby he loues all his creatures approuing the same to be good as they be his by creation the second is the loue of mankind in that he was content to become a redeemer for mankind after their fall and not or any other creature no not for the angels which fell as well as man who therefore remaine without all hope of saluation the third and principall is that wherby he loues his elect and chosen children which is that speciall sauour whereby he accepts of them to life euerlasting this third degree hath two parts first it is taken for his purpose to loue as when he saith i haue loued iacob and hated esau rom secondly for the act of louing which is the declaration of his purpose by spirituall benefits john behold what singular loue god hath shewed vnto vs that wee should be called the sonnes of god noting the declaration of his loue in the gift of adoption so in this verse by the loue of christ vnto his church is meant the actuall declaration of his speciall fauour in accepting them for his children and bestowing many singular blessings vpon them whereas s john placeth this in the first place of all the benefites of christ that he loued vs hee would teach vs that this speciall loue is the very ground of mans redemption which excludeth all foreseene faith and workes from being motiues of mans election in god eternall councell and so proportionally all foreseene sinnes from being motiues in god of mans reprobation it may be obiected the loue of god as also of man respects a thing as it is good first the thing must be good and then it is loued and so in mans redemption god first foresees their goodnesse and therefore chuseth them ans there is great difference betweene the loue of the creature and of the creator the loue of the creature followes the goodnesse of a thing because he seeth it is good therefore he loues it but god the creator first loues the creature before it bee good and hence it comes that it is good because he loues it secondly whereas saint john and all the churches of asia as other true churches do beleeue and are assured that christ loues them for that saint john taketh for granted this should moue all man to haue this care to labour aboue all things to be rooted and grounded in the loue of god seeing hee placeth that in the first place this is the principall thing wherein the apostle would haue the ephesians rooted and grounded and therefore prayeth that with all saints they may be able to comprehend what is the breadth and length deapth and height th of ephesian verse this we doe when we are assured in heart and conscience by the working of god spirit that he loues vs in christ so that he which denies vnto vs the assurance of god loue in christ takes away the very ground of our saluation now that we may haue this assurance of god loue wee must in all good duties to god and man draw neere to god with our hearts keeping a good conscience in all things and then will god draw neere to vs if any man loue me saith christ he will keepe my word and then my father will loue him and we will come in vnto him and dwell with him john meaning by the holy ghost which shall shed this loue into our hearts rom verse causing vs to increase in the feeling thereof as wee grow in faith and obedience towards him and hath washed vs from our sinnes in his bloud here is the second benefit and action of christ to his church where first of all the very phrase hath washed vs doth import that the sinnes of man are as filthie spots in their soules and that himselfe and this church of god were touched with a serious consideration of their vilenesse by reason of their sinnes for washing presupposeth former filthinesse and pollution thus did dauid most sensibly feele his owne filthinesse and see his miserable estate when he desired the lord to psalm wash him throughly confessing thereby that his soule and body were so foulely stained and polluted with sinne that once washing was not ynough but sayth hee wash mee againe and againe rince bathe and swill me in the bloud of christ till i be purged and cleansed from all my sinnes and this same affection should be in euery one of vs wee should labour that our hearts may bee touched with a liuely sence of our vile estate by reason of our sinnes which make both bodie and soule most vgly and filthie in god sight and that the staine hereof is so deepely set in our soules that we can neuer be cleansed but by the washing of christ his own hand and that in his owne hearts bloud yes that one washing will not serue but wee must be rinced and bathed therein for till such time as this consideration doe in some measure take place in our hearts it is not possible that we should loath sinne as we ought or come to this comfortable assurance of god loue that he hath washed away our sinnes in his bloud for this humilitie in our soules by reason of our sins is the beginning of all true grace and comfort now this worke of christ in washing vs from our sinnes doth comprehend a double benefit first the remission of our sinnes whereby the guilt and punishment due to them is taken away secondly the mortification of sinne whereby the corruption of sinne is remooued and abolished and we must obserue that s john propounds this benefit generally without limitation saying which washed vs from our sinnes that is from all our sinnes to giue vs to vnderstand that if any beleeue truly in christ hee hath pardon of all his sinnes without any restraint or limitation either of number or qualitie bee they neuer so many or neuer so great by his bloud how can bloud wash away filthinesse nay it rather defiles a man answer this washing stands not in the substance of christs bloud but in the merit thereof for that substance of bloud which was shed is lost and wee know not what is become of it whatsoeuer the papists say but the merit therof remaineth still and christs bloud deserues to purge away sinne rather than any other mans bloud as of peter john ampc because his bloud was the bloud of god not of the godhead but of him who was both god and man for the manhood of christ was receiued into the vnion of the second person and so it may be called the bloud of god as paule sayth act god redeemed his church by his bloud that is christ god incarnate and so it being the bloud of him that is god is more meritorious than the bloud of any creature whatsoeuer besides christ was appointed by god to be a publicke person in the worke of redemption and in his death and passion he stood in the roome and stead of all his elect so as when his bloud was shed their bloud was sh because it was shed for them but the bloud of other priuate man cannot answer for any besides themselues because it is shed onely for themselues then dam ble is the doctrine of the papists who hold the bloud of martyrs can merit for others being applied vnto them for seeing they be but priuate man and suffered in their owne persons onely they cannot profit any other thereby by bloud we must vnderstand the passion of christ a part for the whole and with all his fulfilling of the law vpon the crosse for in his suffering hee fulfilled the law and in fulfilling the law he suffered these two cannot be seuered saue onely in thought and so this word containes the whole obedience of christ whereby he procured the remission and mortification of our sinnes here then wee see two notable benefites of christ vnto his church his loue amp the washing away of sinnes which s john sets downe to moue the churches with reuerence amp diligence to reade and delight in this booke all of vs will say wee are sure god loues vs and hath pardoned our sinnes in christ why then doe wee not shew our loue againe to him by hearing and reading his word set downe in this or any other booke of scripture and by yeelding answerable obedience thereto why then do we not offer vp ourselues soules and body to serue him as the apostle requires rom by way of recompence for his mercies and loue shed out vnto vs but alas that is more common which is most shamefull to turne god grace into wantonnesse for when man say god loues them and hath washed away their sinnes yet they rebell against him when as these two benefites are here recorded to bee in ucements of continuall loue and obedience to his holy word in these words is set downe the third worke and benefit of christ bestowed on his church and on euery true member thereof for the better vnderstanding whereof we must consider in them foure points first the dignitie and excellencie of all true beleeuers and member of christ they are kings and priests secondly when they be made kings and priests in this life noted by the phrase of speech hath ma wherein speaketh of the church on earth and vseth a word that signifieth the time past thirdly the maner how they become kings and priests they are not so borne but christ hath made them such fourthly to whom they be made such to god euen the father for the first the dignitie of all true beleeuers hath two heads first they bee kings secondly priests they are called kings not in regard of an earthly kingdome for vsually the condition of most beleeuers on earth is base and contemptible but in regard of a spirituall kingdome the kingdome of heauen whereto the lord giues them right title and interest in and by iesus christ so our sauiour christ speaketh to his disciples luke feare not little flocke it is your fathers will to giue you the kingdome and againe behold i giue vnto you a kingdome now the faithfull are kings in these respects first because by christ they bee lord and conquerours of all these enemy sinne sathan the world death hell and their owne flesh secondly because in and by christ they are partakers of the glorie of christs kingdome and saluation for they receiue of christ grace for grace and so answereably glory for glory and felicitie for felicitie thirdly because they be made lord of all things in heauen and earth except good angels and the church all things are yours whether it be paule or apollos or cephas or the world or life or death whether things present or to come euen all are yours and yee christs quest but if christ bee king and all his members kings how do they differ answer in two points first christ is the son of god by nature and so a king by nature hauing the right of the kingdome of heauen by inheritance but the members of christ are the sonnes of god by adoption in his son so that our right to that kingdome is not by nature but by grace secondly christ is an vniuersall king ouer the angels in heauen the church on earth and all other creatures wheresoeuer his regiment is absolute in the hearts and consciences of man and hee can by his word bind all things but true beleeuers bee not vniuersall kings for they haue no superioritie aboue good angels and the church neither are they absolute kings as he is nor of themselues but by christ iesus and as they participate with christ in his kingdome the second part of the dignitie of true beleeuers stands in this that they bee priests consecrate and set apart by christ to the worship amp seruice of god here in this life in spirit and truth and in the life to come to serue and praise him eternally christ hee is a priest so are all his members but yet there is difference first christ hee is an externall and reall priest of the new testament which offers vp a true reall and externall pr pitiatorie sacrifice to god the father for the sinnes of mankind as for beleeuers they are not reall and externall priests but spirituall offer vp spirituall sacrifice vnto god as when any member of christ giues an almes hee offers a sacrifice to god not a corporall sacrifice though the thing giuen be a bodily substance but it is euery way spirituall for to offer a reall outward sacrifice in the new testament is proper to christ againe our sauiour christ he is a perfect priest and offers vp a perfect sacrifice but we being imperfect doe offer vp imperfect sacrifices tainted and blemished with sinne yet accepted as perfect for the worthinesse of christs sacrifice the second point to be considered is the time whe beleeuers be made kings and priests namely in this life for as in the entrance into an earthly kingdome there bee degrees first to haue good right and title to it secondly to get possession of it which is more than title only and yet if a mans title be good thogh hee want possession he may be called a king so it is with god children they haue the right giuen them of the kingdome of heauen in this life and in that respect are kings further in the possessing of a kingdome there bee two degrees first the entrance vpon some part secondly the full and perfect enioying of all now euery true beleeuer begins to enter possession of the kingdom of heauen in this life for it stands rom rig eousnesse ioy and peace and they which these things in their harts haue the kingdome of god begun in them in this life but the full fruition and perfect posses on of this kingdome is reserued to be giuen at the end of this life and at the d y of iudgement and as true beleeuers be kings in this world so likewise bee they priests in offer spirituall sacrifice to god and dedicating and consecrating themselues to his seruice all the dayes of their life the third point is the manner how true beleeuers become kings and priests they are not such by nature neither doth this dignitie come by descent in bloud or birth right or by any other priuiledge they haue from man but onely from christ iesus who by diuine calling makes them spirituall kings and priests like as vnder the law by solemne election and ordination some were made earthly kings and priests now in this calling of christ two things concurre first christ giueth his members right to his owne kingdome and priesthood yet not so that they can execute the regiment sustained by christ or perform the office of his priesthood but because they haue right in part to these offices and the benefit of them both redoundeth to them wholly and this right they haue is brought to passe in the couenant of the gospell wherein they are bound to beleeue in god through christ and god is bound againe to giue vnto them christ with all his benefites among which these two must be accounted for indeed euery thing which belongs to christ as he is mediatour is conueyed in some sort to euery true beleeuer secondly in this diuine calling christ endues all his members with gifts and graces whereby they are enabled for the duties of spirituall kings and priests vnto god for as christ is annointed so are all his members so the psalmist speaking of christ sayth he is annointed with the oyle of gladnesse aboue his fellowes psalm verse therefore his fellowes that is beleeuers are annointed with the same oile though in lesse measure and saint john sayth yee haue receiued the annointing john yes god himselfe chargeth wicked man not to touch his annointed psalm meaning not onely patriarkes kings and prophets but all true beleeuers who are then annointed when they are endued with the gifts of the same spirit in some measure wherewith christ in his manhood was filled aboue measure the fourth point to whom hath he made them kings and priests answer to god euen the father this is added for speciall cause to preuent that carnall libertie which mans nature might claime from this spirituall royaltie for man might say if all beleeuers be kings then may they liue as they list but these words vnto god do shew that the right of their kingdome with the offices of their priesthood must all bee referred to the honor and prayse of god vnto whom they are made kings and priests lastly he addeth euen his father by way of exposition to shew more particularly to which of the persons they are first of all made kings and priests for the title god must not here be taken absolutely for the diuine nature but with restraint to the first person the father vnto whom all true beleeuers are made kings and priests in the first place and from the father to the son and from them both to the holy ghost and the first person in trinitie is here named aboue the rest not as being aboue them in degree or honour for so they bee equall but because he is the first in order and the fountaine of the godhead which is conueyed from him to the son and from them both to the holy ghost thus much for the meaning of the words now follow sundry vses from the consideration of these two dignities of beleeuers and first their kingly dignitie affoordeth matter both of instruction and consolation instruct i whereas all true beleeuers are made true kings in this life hereby euery one that professeth christian religion is taught to carry himselfe as an enemie to all those that are of the kingdome of darkenesse as namely to sinne and sathan to the flesh and the world euen through the whole course of his life for by calling euery christian hath title to the kingdome of heauen what affinitie then can wee haue with those that bee both enemy of this kingdome and of christ himselfe that made vs kings now that wee may so carry our selues as enemy wee must do these three things first haue care to keepe guard and defend our selues as kings against all our enemy sin sathan our own flesh and the enticements of the world as king protect their kingdoms so must we labour to keepe our soul and body and euery facultie and part of them our wils affections thoughts and inclinations from the power of sinne hee which is borne of god keepeth himselfe as with watch and ward that the euill one that i sathan touch him not by the assaults of sinne john secondly wee must make war continually against sathan sinne our owne flesh against all our spirituall enemy and all the enticements of the world we must make no truce with the because they will neuer be reconciled to vs so long as wee haue interest vnto the kingdome of heauen and if we yeeld to them wee loose our kingly dignitie and become their vassales and bondslaues thirdly wee must labour to kill and destroy these our enemy as much as possibly we can by that power we haue from christ our head and like valiant kings seek to haue the bloud of these enemy and from day to day striue to vanquish sathan his power amp might to ouercome the world and to weaken our owne corruption instruct ii if in this life we be kings then must wee become lord ouer our selues and keepe in subiection vnto god our wils and affections and the secret thoughts and inclinations of our soules we must not looke for rule ouer earthly kingdomes but herein stands our kingdom in this world that wee can subdue our corrupt affections and keep our body and soules in obedience vnto god if a man were prince ouer the whole earth and yet could not rule himselfe he were but a poore prince nay he were no prince indeed but though a man haue not so much as a foot of ground in this world and yet can rule and master himselfe his thoughts and affections this man is a valiant prince and one whom christ hath consecrate to be king in heauen instruct iii seeing we be kings wee must doe the duty of iudges for to him that is a king belongeth soueraine iudgment in the day of iudgement the corinthian saints shall iudge the world and angels also but wee must bee iudges in this world and yet here we can neither iudge man nor angels but wee must bee our owne iudges wherefore as iudges summon arr igne condemne ampc so must wee examine our selues call our selues to account and as guiltie persons accuse and condemne our selues for our sinnes acknowledging we be worthy to be cast into eternall damnation with the diuel and his angels and withall plead for pardon and approch to the throne of grace amp forgiuenesse in christ and in this wee shew our selues vpright spirituall iudges and by this meanes wee shall bee fr e from the iudgement to come instruct iiii if wee bee kings by christ we must carry our selues as kings couragiously and constantly in the afflictions and miseries which we shall suffer for christs sake for herein among the rest stands the royaltie of a king that he beares with valour and courage all the troubles which befall him hence it is that saint paule exhorts vs to reioyce in afflictions because wee are partakers of christs sufferings pet and so are made conformable vnto him that was consecrate the prince of our saluation through afflictions heb instruct v seeing wee bee spirituall kings wee must aboue all things labour and seeke to haue our part in the kingdome of christ and in his righteousnes a christian must not haue his heart glued and fast tied vnto the things of this world it is against his calling but hee must so vse this world as though he vsed it not if a king should lay downe his crowne and go and become a shepheard or of some manuall trade all man would maruell at it so it fareth with them that professe themselues to be christians and yet bend their wits and endeuors wholly for these worldly things they doe as it were cast aside their kingly crowne and abase themselues to slauish bondage but we must euer after haue our hearts fixed in heauen striuing to come to our inheritance there instruct vi seeing all the true members of christ be kings and princes this should be an inducement to al backward persons to loue and embrace true religion in these carelesse dayes religion is counted precisenesse and the profession thereof made a matter of reproch but this ought not to bee so seeing that by it wee come to haue right and interest vnto the kingdome of heauen and to bee lord of all creatures and why should we not esteeme the gospell preached as a most precious iewell seeing that wee which are vassales of sathan and firebrands of hell as all man are by nature become thereby the members of christ yes kings and princes to god yes verely the consideration of this should make the ministers of the gospell to ioy in their callings and to take all paines to preach the word seeing by it man become of vassals of sathan the true members of christ and heires of the kingdome of heauen in this world it is counted great honour to consecrate and establish one in an earthly kingdome what a blessed and honourable thing then is this to consecrate spirituall kings for the kingdome of heauen and this is done when by the word preached man are conuerted and brought to vnfained repentance for their sinnes amp to true faith in christ iesus thus much for the duties now follow the consolations to euery true beleeuer onely it is an heauie crosse which breeds much anguish to the soule to bee in pouertie and contempt among man yet herein may the child of god stay his heart and lessen his griefe by considering that euen in this state of miserie he is a king vnto god though hee seeme base to the world yet it appeareth not what he shall bee for hee is heire to the kingdome of heauen if a man bee in sicknesse he must consider it is but god messenger to call him out of this world to the full possession of the ioyes of his kingdome if he be in trouble of mind hauing his owne conscience tormented fearefully by sathan with his sinnes yet he must not despaire the lord will giue him an happie issue he must remember he is a king and therefore shall one day haue full conquest ouer sinne sathan and his own corruption yes ouer all his enemy whatsoeuer if he be in the heat of persecution turmoiled and tossed from post to pillar which flesh and bloud cannot brooke yet then hee must consider his holy calling to bee a spirituall king whose propertie it is in the most violent afflictions euen vnto death it selfe as paule sayth to be more than conquerour roman lastly in the very pang of death when nature must needs be dissolued and soule and body separated then must the child of god remember that he is a king in christ and this will stay his heart against the feare of death for herein shall hee see that by death as through a straight passage he shall enter into the full possession of his kingdome and thus much in that wee are kings from the second dignitie of beleeuers which is to be priests vnto god we are likewise taught sundry duties first to teach and instruct one another it was the office of the priest vnder the law to teach the people the will of god the priests lips should preserue knowledge malach verse and now vnder the gospell not onely the minister but euery true beleeuer is a spirituall priest and therefore ought to teach and admonish one another coloss when the lord sayth touch no mine annoynted and doe my prophets no harme psalm he calleth all his faithfull by the name of prophets because they ought to haue the knowledge of his wil and bee able also in due time and vpon iust occasion to teach the same to others that so the gospell of christ may flourish and as this dutie belongs to all man so especially to gouernours as parents and masters they must shew themselues priests to their charges abraham did it genes dauid did it prou and bathshebath did it prou and all must doe it that desire an holy generation to succeed after them we teach them other things why not religion secondly seeing wee bee priests wee must pray vnfainedly not onely for our selues but tim for all man especially the members of christ the priest in the old testament must pray and make request not onely for himselfe but for the people also and herein stands the praise of a christian to pray for his brother hence it is that paule sayth pray for all the saints and for me ephesian moyses is highly commended for this dutie especially when he prayed for the israelites and stood before the lord in the gap to turne away his wrath exod elijah for his power in prayer and prophesie is called the chariot and horsem n of israell king and this is recorded for the praise of hezechi that when the people were vnprepared at the eating of the passeouer he prayed to the lord for mercy and was h ard chronicle and so when we find any commended in scripture for his gift in prayer it is not so much for that hee prayed diligently for himselfe as for the whole church of god thirdly being priests we must offer spirituall sacrifice vnto god that is dedicate our selues our soules and body and all that is in vs our wit learning knowledge and euery gift of bodie or mind to god seruice that we may doe all this to his glory we must looke that euery thing we take in hand haue his beginning from a pure heart a good conscience and faith vnfained and be directed to a good end to god glory principally and the good of others whom it may concerne fourthly we must be full of blessings the priests in the old testament numbers vsed to blesse the people so must we if we be christians because wee are spirituall priests we must take heede of all cursed speaking of slaundering and backbiting of swearing and forswearing and giue our selues to blessed and gratious speeches to all man and of all man friends or foes rom fiftly wee must seeke to haue god for our portion the leuits had no portion in the land of canaan but the tenth onely deut psalm the lord was their portion so we being priests to god must bee content with any estate in this world for god is our portion we must not seek too much after any inheri nce on earth for then we carry not our selues like priests vnto god the fauour of god in christ must be the thing we long for and therin must we reioyce to him be glory and dominion for euermore amen these words are a thanks giuing to god for the former benefits of christ bestowed on his church which s john putteth in before hee haue ended his record of the gracious workes of christ for his church as it were interrupting himselfe for the great desire hee had to the glory of god whereby wee are taught that the consideration of god benefites towards vs specially such as concerne the kingdom of heauen should stirre vp our hearts to giue continuall prayse and glory to god this was dauids affection when he felt in his soule the pardon of his sinnes and therefore hee breakes out into this thanksgiuing my soule prayse thou the lord and forget not all his benefits psalme and so did paule after the blessed memory of god mercy in his vocation tim secondly in this example of john wee may learne what is the true forme of giuing thankes to god namely to ascribe vnto him all power glory and absolute dominion for euermore but alas it is too too manifest that our corrupt nature will not do this but taking from god his due bestoweth it on creatures yes on our owne selues it is a matter of grace to know what is due to god and to ascribe the same vnto him and therefore we are charged to giue vnto the lord glory and power which in the next words he cals the glory of his name psalm so christ he teacheth vs to ascribe all power glory might and dominion to god when wee say in the lord prayer for thine is the kingdome the power and glory that is the kingdome of heauen is thine all power in heauen and earth is thine and therefore all glory is thine and from our hearts wee doe ascribe the same vnto thee lastly s john addeth amen that is so be it let all glory and dominion bee giuen to christ which is the same he said before whereby he doth testifie his feruent affection and strength of desire after the glory of christ else he would not haue doubled his thanksgiuing and so should it be with vs we should not freese in our thankesgiuing for god benefits but labour to haue our hearts amp tongues to double the same that thereby we may testifie our feruent and earnest desire after his praise and glory these words are a declaration of the fourth action of our sauiour christ towards his church and that is his second comming to iudgement to iudge both quicke and dead wherein wee are to consider sundry points first this note of attention behold secondly the action of christs comming it selfe hee commeth thirdly the manner how with clouds amplified by the manifestation therof euery eye shall see him euen they that pierced him fourthly the effect of his comming all tribes of the earth shall waile fiftly the conclusion of this narration with two notes of asseueration euen so amen to confirme the second comming of christ vnto all people i point behold first saint john beginneth this narration with a note of attention the spirit of god is accustomed when any thing is of special weight and worth our carefull marking to prefixe before it this note of attention behold or such like hence then wee are taught this speciall dutie namely often and euery day earnestly and seriously to bethinke our selues of the second comming of christ to iudgement this consideration is a matter of great vse for it is a notable meanes to begin and continue the conuersion of a sinner vnto god when the scribes and pharises obstinat enemy came to the baptisme of s john hee vsed this as a meanes to make them to turne and beleeue in christ saying ob generation of vipers who hath forewarned you that you should flie from the vengeance to come matth so peter vseth this same argument to bring the iewes to repentance exhorting them to turne that their sinnes might be put away when the day of refreshing that is the day of iudgement should come acts paule persuades the athenians to repentance because there is a day appointed in which the lord will iudge the world by iesus christ act secondly this note of attention serues to strike our hearts with a feare and reuerence of christ iesus for it giues vs warning that hee shall come to bee our iudge we are touched with awe and reuerence toward earthly magistrats when we consider that they haue authority to attach apprehend amp to bring vs to their courts and assizes how much more should this worke in vs a reuerend awe towards christ when wee consider that one day wee must all bee brought before his tribunall seat and there bee iudged of him ii point the comming of christ himselfe hee comes that is christ locally descendeth from the highest heauen in his manhood to that part of the world where the clouds be there to giue iudgement vpon all mankind quick and dead here marke in what manner john propounds his comming hee sayth nor he shall come but in the present time hee commeth whereby hee would teach vs first that this second comming of christ is as certaine as if it were now present secondly that it is not long to or far off but will be quickly thirdly that our dutie is to consider of the comming of christ as of a thing present this saint john learned and so should wee by his example for it is a matter of great vse for hence we are taught to desire and doe that euery day which we would desire and doe in the day of iudgement and blessed is hee that attaineth hereunto now that we may come to the practise of this dutie wee must dayly consider of the comming of christ not as a thing to be delayed or farre off but as a thing present wee must euery day call our selues to a reckoning and account and persuade our selues this may be the last day and so shall we carry our selues euery day as wee would in the last day now we would wish at the day of iudgment that wee did repent and beleeue in christ and therefore euery day of our life before the last iudgement come we ought to repent and beleeue in christ if this dutie were practised we should find lesse corruption and more grace in our hearts and lesse sinne d more obedience in our liues euery day than other but grace is wanting and sinne abounds because this meditation takes no place in our hearts againe in that hee sayth hee commeth meaning in respect of his manhood hence wee gather hee is absent from vs in regard of bodily presence and the heauens must containe him vntill the day of iudgement but if christ were alwayes bodily present in the sacrament hee could not bee said to come but onely to manifest himselfe being before present and therefore the opinion of those which hold the body of christ to be really the bread to bee in or about the bread of the sacrament is most false and friuolous flat against that article of our faith whereby wee hold that he comes from heauen onely at the last day in regard of his manhood iii point the manner of christs christs comming in two things first that he comes with clouds secondly that his comming is open and visible to euerie eye first with clouds here s john speaketh after the manner of the prophets who to set out god in his maiestie and glory say he comes with clouds rides on the wings of the wind as though he had sayd he comes in exceeding maiestie and glorie these words are added to make a distinction betweene the first and second comming of christ his first comming was in humilitie borne of a poore virgin entertained in a stable of an inne but his second comming is with glorie maiestie and dominion in the clouds and the reason is because he came first to be a redeemer and a sauiour by his suffering and therefore came in the state of a servant but his second comming is to bee a iudge of all man yes of his enemy and therfore he commeth with all might maiestie and glory to shew himselfe king and lord of all the vses of this his second comming are set downe in the psalme to make the verie mountaines to tremble to confound the wicked and vngodly and to comfort the godly in that day secondly for his open appearance euerie eye shall see him he shall come in maiestie and glorie not secretly but in visible shew to all the world all man shall see him with their owne eyes all i say which were since the world began to his comming in these words hee toucheth three points first he taketh it here for granted that euerie man shall rise from death to life though their death were neuer so strange or neuer so long before secondly that all man being raised againe shall haue life and motion and their senses restored to them as before they died thirdly that all man none excepted shall come and stand before the tribunall seate of christ and there bee iudged of him in the clouds the consideration whereof is first an exceeding comfort to god children in that they being dead and rotten in their graues shall rise and receiue their life and motion and see christ their sauiour and iudge of all man if a man when hee layeth him downe to sleepe should bee told that when hee rose hee should see his dead father and mother or his dearest friends whom he saw not of long before this would bee a notable comfort to him that now he should inioy them againe how farre greater comfort shall this yeeld to all the godly who haue beene dead and rotten in the graue that they shall be raised vp and not onely to meete with godly friends but enioy christ iesus the son of god which is the friend of friends who shall giue them not onely life and motion but eternall life with his owne maiestie this was iobs comfort that though he died yet he beleeued he should see his redeemer with his eyes and this should be our comfort against the feare of death and last iudgement secondly this is a terror to the wicked and to all impenitent sinners that they shall will they nill they be brought to the barre of christs iudgement seate amp there looke on him who is their iudge whom they have in their life contemned and despised and this consideration may serue to moue them to repentance which haue no begunne to repent and to labour to become the members of christ a also to increase and further repentance in them who haue by god grace begun the same it may be some do thinke when they die all is done and there is no further account to follow but though we lie rotten in our graues a thousand or two thousand yeares yet we shall rise and looke vpon our iudge with our owne eyes and if we haue not in our life time repented we shall heare him with our owne eares giuing the dreadfull sentence against vs go ye cursed into euerlasting fire and therefore it is best for vs in this day of grace to preuent this danger and now repent and beleeue in christ that then we may rise with ioy and stand with hol nesse before christ iesus no doubt if we were persuaded that we should thus appeare it would moue vs to repent thirdly euerie eye shall see him that is all man with their owne eyes shall looke on him hence it may bee gathered that those who wanted their fight in this life shall haue it then restored it is granted of all diuines that the elect shall haue all their senses and other defects restored wherein they were wanting in this life and it may also bee added that the wicked shall then haue some of their senses restored if they wanted the same in this life as hearing and seeing at the least for the deafe shall heare the blind shall see this iudge and this can be no glorie to them seeing it is to increase their miserie for the more senses they haue the more punishment they shall feele because by sense we apprehend miserie euen th se which peirced him here is added a further euidence of christs manifestation of his comming and that for three causes first to shewe that no power or wisedome in the world can free any one from his appearance for if any could escape in all likelihod it would be those iewes and gentiles who preuailed most against christ and put him to death but none of those can escape his iudgement for euen they which peirced him they shall see this iudge and bee summoned before his maiestie for though they had power to kill him yet none of them shall haue power to absent themselues from before his bar of iudgement at the last day secondly to shew the case of all wicked man namely that such woe and miserie shall befall them as they neuer once thought of the iewes and gentiles which crucified christ neuer dreamed of this that he whom they then put to a temporall death should one day be their iudge and condemne them to eternall death vnlesse they had repented thirdly to shew the rufull and wofull estate of all impenitent sinners they shall rise to iudgement and haue the greatest enemie their iudge who will shew rigor vpon them and iustice without all mercie for this peircing of christ is meant not onely of the iew which put him to death but of all vngodly person because all such do by their sinnes as with swords and speares wound him at the heart as the souldiers did impenitent sinners be as the iewes which crucified christ as iudas which betrayed him and as the soldiers which goar his side and vnlesse they now repent they shall one day be iudged as his enemy euen they which peirced him out of these words some gather that the body of christ hath still the wounds and scarres which were giuen him at his death the print of the nailes in his hands and his feete and that these shall be seene in him at the last day adding withall that it is no blemish to christ to haue these but rather an increase of his glorie but this cannot be gathered hence for though it be sayd they shall see him whom they peirced yet it followeth not that they shall see him as he was peirced what though they see the person whom they wounded shal they therefore see his wounds manie shall see kings and queenes whom they crowned in this world but it followeth not that therefore they shall weare their crownes so we shall see our fathers and mothers but not as fathers and mothers iv point the fruite and effect of his comming especially in the wicked in these words and all tribes of the earth shall waile before him where s john speakes of the whole world according to the condition of the land of canaan for only that part of the world was diuided into tribes as in like case our sauiour christ setteth out the iudgement of the whole world according to the state and manner of iudging the visible church math so that his meaning is that they which repented not of what nation soeuer of what state or condition soeuer they haue bene shall wayle and mourne at that day and hee addes a reason of this their mourning in these words for him before him or ouer him that is they shall wayle and lament with exceeding lamentation because they beleeued not his word but contemned him and his doctrine and therefore now they want all help to free them from the punishmet of their vnbeleefe and contempt of the gospell for this life is the only time of grace and mercie afterward there is no worke nor inuention that can alter mans estate hence then we are admonished first that in this world we labour aboue all things to be reconciled to god in christ to get our sinnes pardoned to beleeue and imbrace his holy word and vnlesse we attaine hereunto in this life we shall wayle eternallie for when the last day is co e there is no hope of help no way to escape no time of grace to repe remember the foolish virgin that sought for oyle when it was too late and knocked when the doores were shut math but if by god mercie we can in this life get his loue and fauour in christ then shall we enioy the same eternally yes at this dreadfull day to all the wicked we shall lift vp our heads and our harts when wee shall see christ comming to our full redemption all teares shall bee wiped from our eyes when the wicked shall crie and houle woe and alas for euermore the diuell knowing the worth of this admonition will labour by all meanes to keepe it from our hearts but this shall bee our wisedome betime to sue for grace and so shall wee defeat sathan and preuent eternall wailing secondly here see what an euill conscience is it lieth asleep here while a man liues and neuer troubleth him and so it may do in death also but in the last day when he shall see his iudge with his eies then it will stirre it will torment him it will attach accuse and condemne him it will lay to his charge all his sinnes his contempt of christ and his word his vnbeleefe in the time of grace and then it will breake his heart being as good as a thousand witnesses to condemne him this should cause all man to labour to get a good conscience washed and purged in the bloud of christ which will not suffer vs to lie in any one sinne and vpon our repentance will assure vs we be in the fauour of god which if it do in this life then will it neuer make vs to waile at the last day but it will excuse vs and make vs looke vp to our redeemer and to reioyce in him but take heed when thy conscience lieth asleepe and accuseth not for thy sinnes no not at death that is an euill conscience which will awake at the day of iudgement to torment and condemne thee v point the meanes whereby hee confirmeth the certaintie of the second comming of christ that is by a double note of asseueration euen so amen one of these is taken from the greeks euen so the second from the hebrews amen being both as much as amen amen or verily verily in which phrase saint john teacheth vs how to confirme the things we auouch there bee three wayes wherby a thing may be auouched first by a simple and bare affirmation or negation secondly by an earnest asseueration thirdly by an oath now s john vseth these two notes of assuring in this weightie matter of christs second comming saying he commeth euen so amen that is certainly and without all doubt it is so hereby teaching vs first that an asseueration must not be vsed but only when the matter in hand is of great weight and moment here then we see that wretched is their practise who vse to bind euerie word with an oath which is a degree aboue this asseueration yes they also are here iustly reprooued who in their ordinarie communication haue euer in their mouth some weightie asseueration our sauiour often vseth these words of asseueration yet onely in matters of weight and moment and when the hearers were to be moued to greater attention and their hearts were to bee more fully setled in some truth of great importance secondly by these asseuerations john would teach vs to hold against the practise of atheists that the comming of christ is most certaine and vndoubted which thing we should more seriously obserue because in our corrupt nature there is bred this false persuasion that either wee shall not bee summoned to iudgement or else that christs comming is farre off like to the euill servant who saith my maister deferres his comming which euill servant by nature is euerie one of vs thirdly hereby john giues vs to vnderstand one speciall note and marke of the child of god namely to desire and long after vnfainedly the second comming of christ to iudgement for as these words be an asseueration so withall they containe a most earnest desire euen so amen as if he should say by way of answer to the proclaiming of his comming lord grant it be so yes lord let it be so hence it is that saint paule describes all those who must receiue the crowne of righteousnesse by this propertie that they loue his appearing tim as for the vngodly it is not so with them they being not iustified nor sanctified and so not reconciled to god in christ cannot loue this appearing nay they could wish with all their heart there were no hell nor last iudgement and by this one note we may well iudge of our estates for if from our hearts we desire and long for this second comming to iudgement and wish he would come revelation quickly then it is a certaine token and signe we bee reconciled to god in christ and shall receiue the crowne of righteousnesse but if as yet wee feele not this longing and hungering desire in vs then we must suspect our selues and labour euery day to feele it for it is the desire of the saints to say reue how long lord and with john euen so amen after saint john had described christ at large in the former verses he bringeth him in speaking of himselfe by a figure as may appeare by this clause saith the lord the end and scope of these words in this verse is to confirme that which was before spoken of christ being a proofe and reason thereof after this manner to be conceiued he which is the beginning and the end of all ampc he is sufficient to be a king priest and prophet to the church and is both able and willing to bestow on them all blessings which serue for their good the first part of this argument is omitted the second part is contained in this eight verse but i am the beginning and the end and therefore i am sufficient ampc in this eight verse are three points concerning christ first he is the beginning and the end secondly he is was and is to come thirdly he is almightie for the first that christ is the beginning and the end saint john expresseth by a comparison taken from the greeke alphabet and it standeth thus as in the a b c of the grecians alpha is the first letter and therefore the beginning of all the letters and omega is the last and therefore the end of all the letters so saith christ am i the beginning of all things that are and the end of all things the first part of this similitude is in these words i am alpha and omega that is i am as alpha and omega the second part in these words the beginning and the end from this and such like manner of speaking the papists gather that it is lawful to worshippe god in a strange language and that the scriptures are to be read and deliuered to the people in an vnknowne tongue but their collection is friuolous for though the vnlearned english man know not what alpha and omega is yet the churches to whome this booke was written being grecians knew generally what was meant hereby againe though the spirit of god vseth here and there a strange word or phrase yet we may not follow that practise in the whole seruice and worship of god whereby neither the word nor prayer should be vnderstood of the people as the papists do i am the beginning christ is sayd to bee the beginning for two causes first because he was the verie first of all things there was nothing before him he had being when all creatures were not then was he the same that he is now and for this saith saint john chap verse in the beginning was the word that is the son of god he had his beeing and subsisting when all other creatures wanted it and began to be this proueth the eternitie of christ because hee had his being before any creature he was a substance and essence begotten of the father before all worlds not created as other creatures are or made of any other secondly he is called the beginning because he giueth a beginning to al creatures for all things which were created and had a being were created by him and had their being from him so saith the apostle all things are from him and for him colos and hence we learne that when we go about any businesse in word or deed we must begin it with inuocation on the name of christ for christ he giues the beginning and proceeding to all things and without his helpe we cannot haue in any thing good successe secondly the same christ is the end of all things and that for two causes first because he is the last of all things and after him is nothing in subsisting and being for all creatures if they were left to themselues would come to nothing and whereas some creatures be eternall it is not of themselues but by him and from him which is the end but though they all should come to nothing yet christ would remaine the same he was for euer namely the eternall son and word of the father this then should make vs with full purpose of heart to cleaue vnto christ in all things if wee would enioy eternall happinesse for without him is nothing but changing and vnlesse wee haue our stablenesse from him wee cannot but come to an end secondly hee is the end because all things in heauen and earth were made to serue him for him were all things created coloss that is to serue for his glory and prayse the second thing here said of christ is this which is was and is to come these words were expounded in the fourth verse where the very same are affirmed of the father the meaning is that christ is in presence a perfect substance and essence or being subsisting in by and from himselfe and such a substance hee was in time past from all eternitie and such as shall continue in time to come for euermore hence we learne three things first that the second person in the trinitie is consubstantiall with the father that is of one and the same substance and nature with him the reason is because there can be but one only substance or essence which hath being in and by it selfe and from it selfe alone neither can we conceiue how there should be two or more but onely one as there cannot bee two eternals or two infinits two omnipotents and absolute lord which haue nothing one of another now in the fourth verse it is said of the father that he is a substance of himselfe in himselfe and from himselfe alone and here the selfesame thing is said of the second person the son and therefore hee is of the very same substance with the father for though they bee distinct persons in the godhead yet they haue but one and the same substance one and the same diuine nature and godhead secondly hence we may gather that christ is god of himselfe because as the ther is was and shall bee so the son i was and shall be and that in the same respects so that as the father is god of himselfe and from none other so the son is god of himselfe and from none other indeed as he is the son the second person so hee is of the father and hath his being from him by eternall generation but as hee is god hee is consubstantiall with the father and coequall with him and hath his essence of and in himselfe alone and the same is to bee affirmed of the holy ghost as he is the third person he proceeds from the father and the son but as hee is god hee is of himselfe and from none other thirdly hence we learn that christ is coeternall with the father being euerlasting as the father is and euery way coequall hauing the same attributes of the godhead that the father hath the third point touching christ is that he is the almightie there is in god and so in christ a double power first a potentiall secondly an actuall power potentiall is that whereby hee can doe many things moe than euer hee did or will doe as hee could raise children to abraham of the stones but he would not hee could haue deliuered christ from death but hee would not now christs omnipotencie is not to be vnderstood of his potentiall power here principally but rather of his actuall power whereby he bringeth to passe without let and impediment whatsoeuer hee decreeth willeth or promiseth from this omnipotencie of christ ariseth a double comfort to his church first that whatsoeuer hee hath promised in his gospell is yes and amen that is shall bee brought to passe effectually without stop and let as assuredly as hee promised it now christ hath promised in the gospell to all penitent sinners remission of sinnes mortification iustification and life euerlasting euery one whereof shall in due time bee done to euery true beleeuer which is a singular comfort to them for all man and angels cannot giue one of these to any one man but christ hee is omnipotent and he both can and will effect them all to his elect the second comfort that christ both can and will giue his church sufficient securitie and protection through all the miseries of this life hee can defend and guard her against all the furie and malice of sathan and all her enemy hee is aboue them and can bridle their might when and how he pleaseth hence also that christ is almightie we are taught two duties first vnder the crosse and in tribulation to humble our selues vnder his mightie hand for it is he which correcteth vs who is almighty able to do what he list and more than he will resistance or repining will doe vs no good secondly this should mooue vs to performe heartie obedience vnto christ in all things both in our generall and particular callings to walke vprightly before him for he is almightie amp seeth whether we walke sincerely before him or not if wee doe not hee is able to punish vs by this argument god persuadeth abraham to walke vprightly before him because he is almightie able to correct and destroy those which refuse to obey him genes hetherto wee haue entreated of the preface of this booke containing the title and inscription thereof now from this ninth verse to the end of the third chapter is contained one of those seuen visions which were shewed vnto john and are set downe in this booke in this first vision two things are to bee noted first the circumstances secondly the parts thereof the circumstances in the ninth and tenth verses the parts from thence to the end of the third chapter the circumstances of this vision are foure first the person to whom this vision was shewed namely john the second the place where at pa mos the third the manner how it is propounded it was deliuered to him being the spirit the fourth the time when on the lord day for the first john is the person to whom this vision befell who doth therfore name himselfe to shew that it was giuen him of the lord for as the lord hath his visions and re elations as hath beene sayd so the diuell hath his but they may bee distinguished by the persons to whom they be giuen god giueth his visions not to all man but vnto those which are most it for them such as bee most holy man for life endued with exceeding gifts of god a knowledge wisdome constancie zeale pietie and religion so in the old testament hee deliuered not them to all his servant the prophets man of singular gifts and graces and of exceeding holinesse amp pietie indeed the lord reuealed some particular things by wicked man as by balaam and caypha but they neuer knew what those things meant which were shewed vnto them it is a propertie belonging to the servant of god to receiue a vision and to know the same to their comfort and for both these was john throughly qualified he was a man of exceeding holinesse of life for christ loued him and of singular and rare gifts full of zeale loue and pietie and also had the knowledge of this vision made knowne vnto him but the diuel maketh no such choise his visions befall man which are heretickes wicked notorious sinners who haue no such rare and speciall gifts as the other haue so that wee must esteeme of this as a singular gift of god to his owne apostle s john now john hauing named himselfe to bee the receiuer of this vision for the greater credit hereof he describes himselfe by two modest tearmes first a brother secondly a companion first hee cals himselfe their brother that is of them who by faith were all members of the mysticall bodie of christ for the church of god is a familie whereof god the father is head and house holder iesus christ is the lder brother and all beleeuers are fellow brother in and by christ being by faith the adopted sonnes of god members of that familie and brother to other by this title your brother first hee setteth out his humility and great modesty for hee was a man at that time aboue all man which liue in regina rd of his gifts and holinesse of life hee was the last apostle and had apostolicall authoritie b ing a most ze lous and constant professour yet hee calleth himselfe a brother to himselfe but equall with them though they were farre inferior to him and so should we esteeme better of our brother than of our selues and make our selues inferiour to them secondly by this title we see he had his heart full of brotherly loue to all the members of the church of christ he loued them as brother so we are bound to loue all man euen our enemy as they be of the same flesh with vs but those that bee of the same faith and religion with vs to these especially should wee shew our loue and affection so paule sayth to the christian romans he affectioned to loue one another with brotherly loue rom and great reason for beleeuers are linked each to other with the neerest bond they haue the same father which is god the same redeemer the same faith hope baptisme and the same benefit by iesus christ his death and obedience but this dutie is not practised there be that call themselues brother who as isay saith hate them that tremble at the word and mocke them euen for the profession of the same religion whereby they thinke to be saued if any seeme to make more conscience of their wayes than others they are reuiled and hated for the name of christ which ought not to bee for among all true christians should bee brotherly loue the second title companion or copartner in three things in tribulations in the kingdome and in the patience of christ he cals himselfe copartner with in tribulations for two causus first because at that time when hee wrote this vision the whole church was in persecution and tribulation vnder that cruell tyrant dom ian about fourescore or an hundred years after christ who banished him into where he was not vnmindful of the afflictions of the church whereof he was a member and therefore cals himselfe a partner with them in affliction by which he shews what is that state of god church in this world namely to be vnder the crosse and the members thereof must not bee companions of peace and ease but copartners in affliction and tribulation and therefore christ teacheth those which will bee his disciples these lessons first to deny themselues to take vp his crosse daily and to follow him and because of this estate the church in this world is called the militant church being in continuall fight against the diuell and his instruments the consideration whereof is of speciall vse for we in this land haue had peace and quietnes for many yeares without persecution which wee must acknowledge for a speciall blessing vouchsafed to vs for this end that now in the time of peace wee might prepare our selues against the day of triall for seeing the estate of the church is to bee vnder afflictions wee are all in duty bound to waite continually when god will call vs out to suffer for his sake no man can define the time or the manner of our triall but yet that it will come we must resolue because of the vsuall estate of the church god hath for a long time sent foorth labourers into his haruest whereby no doubt many sheaues are gathered into the lord barne now after this long gathering there will come a day of ing the lord will take into his hand the of affliction and put it into his corne and thereby try the chaffe from the wheat it stands vs therfore in hand to prepare our selues in this time of peac that wee may bee found good corne in the lord sieue and not chaffe which must be cast into vnquenchable fire secondly he cals himselfe their copartner in afflictions because his pitifull heart was moued with the bowels of compassion towards all his fellow members when he remembred their persecution and affliction vnder the cruell tyrant domitian and the same affection should be in euerie one of vs towards the poore afflicted servant of christ seeing they bee our fellow members wee should haue a fellow feeling with them weeping with them that weepe and shew our compassion in pittying them if the foote be pricked the head stoopes the eye beholds and lookes on it the finger puls it out the hand applies the plaister the other foote is readie to runne for helpe the tongue to aske for counsell amp all the members are readie to affoord their mutuall helpe in pi tie and fellow feeling so when any members of the church suffer affliction be pricked with persecution for christs cause then should we as members of the same body be readie to do all the helpe wee can to them especially in shewing our fellow feeling with them the second thing wherein he is this copartner is in the kingdome of christ that is the kingdome of heauen where obserue that he placeth fellowship in affliction before companion in the kingdome to giue vs to vnderstand that through afflictions amp crosses for christs sake is the readie way to the kingdome it is that way which is beaten and troden by the prophets apostles and the saints of god as the apostle saith act th ough manifold tribulations we must enter into heauen and this corinthian momentarie affliction causeth to vs an inf it weight of glorie not by deseruing it but by shewing the plain way thither wherby we are taught not to thinke it hard when trials do befal vs but rather to count it a good thing yes exceeding great gladnesse when any affliction doth befall vs for christs sake for herby we are brought like wandring sheep into that beate path which leadeth to heauen nay we must rather maruell when we professe the gospell and haue no affliction then we may heb feare wee be out of the way seeing the lord afflicts euerie child which is his thirdly hee is copartner in patience which he addeth because it is a most worthie vertue whereby wee are made able to perseuer in affliction till we come to heauen afflictions are the beaten way heauen is our ioyfull end patience is the meanes to make vs go on till wee come thither whatsoeuer things are written are written for our learning that we through patience amp comfort in the scriptures might haue hope rom where true hope to come to heauen is obtained by patience which maketh a beleeuer to go on in suffering till he come to life eternall there is much fruit in the good ground but not broght forth without patiece amp the true beleeuer is saued by hope in this world yet canot come to heaue without patiece ia for therby he must possesse his s ule now because man will say patience is an hard matter and so are discouraged from seeking for it therefore to set an edge on ther desire he addes it is the patience of christ and it is so called either because he commands it or because it is his gift and commeth from the spirit of christ or chiefly because hee himselfe suffereth in his members and as their miserie and suffering is his so is their patience the consideration whereof is a singular motiue to enduce euery child of god to patience in bearing the crosse for christ his sake for they haue christ their fellow sufferer he takes part with them and puts vnder his shoulder who would not then be content to suffer with patience and thus much of the branches of his fellowship seuerally now consider them ioyntly and they containe a notable description of the communion of saints which is a speciall article of our faith standing in three things in tribulation in the kingdome of heauen and in patience and marke well that this communion begins in tribulation therein we must be partners and that with patience before wee come to haue fellowship in the kingdome of heauen that man therefore that hath afflictions layd on him must beare them patiently and when the members of christ are vnder the crosse hee must in tender compassion be touched with their miseries and when he doth truly feele in his heart this christian patience and compassion then may he assure himselfe he is entred into this communion and shall vndoubtedly with all saints be partaker of the ioyes of heauen but if patience and compassion bee wanting wee persuade our selues in vaine of this communion and therefore let vs striue against impatience and against the deadnesse and hardnesse of our hearts that we may neither murmur against god in our owne afflictions nor ye want compassion towards our brother that any where suffer affliction for the name of christ thus much for the circumstance of the person was in the isle called patmos in these words is the second circumstance namely the place where this vision giuen to john this patmos is one of those island which the geographer call sporades lying in the west part of the lesse neere to the churches to whom john writ and by the sea commonly called the eg n sea this island was a small base and poore island little or neuer a whit inhabited saint john had his vision not at ierusalem at antioch or rome but in patmos a base poore and little inhabited island by this we see that in the new testament there is no respect of one place aboue another in regard of god presence and our fellowship with him hee doth as well manifest himselfe to john by this vision in patmos as to other his prophets and apostles in ierusalem the holy citie in the old testament there was difference of places in regard of god solemne worship and presence as the lord shewed his presence and tied his worship especially to his tabernacle and temple at ierusalem this daniell sheweth by his gesture in prayer for being in captiuity when he prayed in his chamber he opened the window which was towards the temple at ierusalem and turned his face thitherward but now in the new testament that difference of place is abolished in respect of god worship and therefore paule willeth that man pray euery where lifting vp pure hands vnto god and so for all the duties of religion wee must thinke the like i then away with popish pilgrimage to churches and chappels of saints or to their reliques this is meere superstition for god is present euery where and a man that will worship god in spirit and truth may haue fellowship with him in one place as well as another ii also this may serue to correct a false conceit which many haue of our churches and chappels for when they come to a dwelling house they thinke it not their dutie there to humble themselues to kneele downe and call vpon god but if they come into a church or chappell neuer so often vpon ordinarie affaires they fall downe to prayer the reason is because they thinke these places bee more holy and god more present there and they shall sooner be heard in them than in their common houses which is vntrue for in the new testament all such diuersitie of place is abolished in regard of god seruice and presence the dwelling house is as holy as the church indeed churches must bee maintained because in them the people may more orderly and conueniently meet together to serue god publickly in the word and prayer for which time all due reuerence must be obserued in them but we must not think that they are more holy than other places more particularly in this circumstance of place note two things first by what meanes saint john came thither secondly to what end and for what cause the meanes was banishment by the emperour domitian the cause was for the word of god for the first hee came and abode in patmos being banished thither for the gospels sake in this his banishment consider many excellent things first saint john was a most worthy apostle endued with rare gifts a singular maintainer of the gospell and a famous founder of the church of god and chiefe pillar thereof in those dayes when he wrot this booke and for this cause most hated of the cruell persecutor domitian and of the romanes and yet obserue that whereas many other true christians were put to the sword s john is not but escapeth by banishment the cause of this was god speciall prouidence by which hee reserued him for the benefit of the church that hee might receiue this reuelation and commit it to writing for the perpetuall good of all his children and so though domitian was a cruell tyrant and wanted no malice towards john yet hee could not kill him god ouerruled him that he did but banish him and that into such an island wherein he might quietly receiue these visions and pen the same for the good of the church by this wee see the great care and prouidence of god ouer his church that hee doth bridle and ouerrule the cruell minds and might of bloudie persecutors that they cannot for their hearts do any thing but that which serueth for god glory and the good of his church though they intend the contrary for domitian intended onely the hurt of john yet see by his banishment into that isle he had fit place to receiue these visions for the good of the church so in the death of christ the iewes and gentiles and all the people banded themselues together to put christ to death and the diuell he laboured to stirre them on to practise their intended malice yet the ouerruling power of god who bringeth light out of darkenesse directeth and ordereth this their malice and wicked practise to the most excellent worke that euer was euen the redemption of mankind so iosephs brother intended no such deliuerance as god wrought by him in selling their brother this consideration should comfort all god children in the time of any outward distresse euen the remembrance of god ouerruling hand secondly in that john went into banishment when it was so appointed wee learne that when we are oppressed and persecuted by tyrants for christs sake we must not make resistance or offer violence but suffer all iniuries with patience for as one sayth truly the christians weapons in persecution are onely prayers and teares and saint john often in this booke addeth this conclusion after the foretelling of persecution here is the patience of saints shewing that patience must be the complete armour against all our bloodie enemy thirdly here also obserue that john came into this island not of his own accord as chusing a solitarie life to bee the most happie state of perfection but by violence and constraint for if hee had come into it voluntarily being little or not inhabited hee could not haue done the duty of his apostleship in preaching the gospell and laying the foundations of the church this then confuteth the monkish life which is no life of holy perfection as papists call it but of glorious superstition and slat impietie before god for hereby they forsake their callings and vtterly disable themselues to do those duties which god requireth of them in church commonwealth or familie fourthly whereas john being banished receiued his visions in a barren and base desolate place we see that those which honour god shall be honoured of god euen then when man seeke most to disgrace them for what greater disgrace could they haue put vpon john than to banish him into so base an island yet because it was for god glory euen there doth the lord appeare vnto him and honour him much in reuealing vnto him these visions so when ioseph was sold of his brother and most dishonoured of them then did god exhalt him most of all the same may bee sayd of daniell in babylon whom god did most aduance when his enemy sought his greatest ruine and the same is true of all god children them which honour god will he honour ii point the cause for which hee came into this isle is expresly set downe for the word of god that is because he was a publisher and preacher of the word of god for the performance of which dutie he was banished by which wee may note that all naturall man as domitian and his court and all the gentiles without god speciall calling doe beare a deadly hatred towards god word for s john was a most worthy apostle a famous man for gifts a singular preacher of the word of god yet is hated nay banished not for his owne cause but for the word of god this hatred hath appeared in the heathen emperours by their bloudie persecutions against the preachers and professors of this word and yet though man hate it naturally the same word winneth them and taketh place in their hearts for their conuersion and causeth them to loue it so as successiuely it hath beene spread ouer all the world which shews against the atheist that the word taught by the prophets and apostles is indeed the true word of god not the inuention of man for mans word being hated cannot win vnto it him which hateth it but the word of god preuaileth by grace in the hearts of those who hate it by nature which it could not doe vnlesse there were in it some diuine power againe seeing john was banished for god word all ministers are to cast their accounts and make this reckoning that they may and must suffer trouble amp persecution yes sometime banishment it selfe for the gospels sake if they will be faithfull for that which befell the principall founders and chiefe builders of the church cannot bee auoided of them which are ordinary ministers if they will be faithfull christ acquainteth his disciples with this telling them that they are euen accursed when all man speake well of them let none therefore thinke it strange at this day if for well doing they heare and receiue euill nay let them feare the curse when all man prayse them and for the witnessing of iesus christ here john doth note more specially the cause of his banishment to wit for testifying the hystorie and doctrine of the gospell the summe whereof is this that iesus christ the son of marie is the son of god and redeemer of all that beleeue in him to the iustification of life this testimonie s john puts downe to giue vs to vnderstand what part of god word that is which is most hated of the world and for the preaching whereof god ministers are persecuted and banished to wit the gospell of iesus christ especially for the law is in part naturall but the gospell is supernaturall and to mans reason absurd for the preaching whereof man in all ages haue been persecuted the reason hereof is this god in the beginning made a couenant with man promising that the seede of the woman should breake the serpents head now the gospell is that glad tidings wherein is declared that this promised seede is come who hath indeede bruised the head of the serpent hereupon the diuell maligneth the gospel aboue all parts of god word and accordingly hath laboured by al meanes to suppresse the same partly by persecution as hee did in the first three hundred yeares after christ and partly by bringing into the church damnable heresies which did destroy the gospell by deprauing the natures and offices of christ when by outward violence he could not preuaile now seeing the diuell and his instruments doe thus hate the gospell and labour to extinguish it we on the contrarie must labour to know and to beleeue to loue and embrace the gospell that so we may vphold and maintaine the same in this tenth verse are set downe the third and fourth circumstances of this vision the third is the manner of receiuing and giuing this reuelation to john namely in a traunce the fourth is the time when it was giuen on the lord day touching the manner it is noted in these words i was in the spirit that is i was by the mightie and extraordinarie worke of the spirit of god cast into a traunce that this bee so expounded appeareth by comparing this phrase with the like in the whole prophesie of ezechiell who vseth to say i was in the spirit when hee expresseth and signifieth that hee was cast into a traunce and therein receiued some vision by the spirit to vnderstand this the better consider two things first what a traunce is secondly the end of it first a traunce is an extraordinarie worke or action of god spirit wee must not thinke that traunces come from the vertue of the starres nor from the constitution of mans bodie or by the strength of imagination as some haue fondly thought but they are wrought by the holy ghost secondly it is not euery worke of the holy ghost but an extraordinarie worke aboue the order of nature it is also powerfull and mightie wherein the whole man both in bodie and mind is altered which saint john here expresseth saying i was in the spirit this extraordinarie worke of the spirit consisteth in two actions one vpon the bodie the other vpon the mind first in procuring a traunce the spirit of god casteth the body of man into a dead sleepe whereby all the sences both inward and outward are benummed so genes when god renewed his couenant with abraham hee casteth him into an heau e sleepe that is into a traunce wherein all his sences were benummed onely his mind was waking the action of the holy ghost on the mind is to draw it from fellowship with the body and all the sences to haue a neerer fellowship with god that so the spirit of god may enlighten it with diuine light that it may vnderstand the things which are reuealed to it as wee may see in other extasies and traunces of the prophets and apostles as in that of act pe er when he saw the vision of beast cleane and vncleane and thus wee see what a traunce is namely an extraordinarie powerfull work of the spirit vpon the whole man ca ting the bodie into a dead sleepe and making the mind fit to receiue the things which are reuealed vnto it of the lord ii point the end of traunces god for two causes reuealeth his will in traunces vnto his servant as to john in this place first that might know that the things reuealed were not inuented of themselues but giuen of god john herein had no vse of his bodily sences hee neither heard saw nor felt but they were asleepe and therefore the vision must needs be from god and the glory therof wholly his secondly and chiefely that the things reuealed might take the deeper impression in the vnderstanding for the mind being freed from fellowship with the body and not hindered by any phantasies of the sences they being all asleepe and quiet doth then most liuely and sensibly apprehend and retaine the impression of things reuealed here then we see the great care of god that his servant might throughly vnderstand certainely beleeue and constantly keepe in memorie the things hee deliuered vnto them the like care he shewed in reuealing his will to all his former prophets he would not haue their minds troubled with the fellowship of the body nor hindered of the sences inward or outward but wholly taken vp for the seruice of his spirit and there is good reason of this for if they must faithfully teach god will to others to make them know and vnderstand to beleeue amp remember the same is it not necessarie that they themselues should throughly vnderstand soundly beleeue and firmely keepe in memorie whatsoeuer god reuealeth this dealing of the lord for this end with his holy prophets teacheth vs that the ordinarie ministers of the gospell at this day ought to imploy themselues with all care and diligence that they may throughly vnderstand the will of god in his word and withall beleeue it soundly and remember it carefully we must not now looke for traunces and visions as they had but we must vse continuall study in the word which is the ordinarie meanes to come vnto this knowledge this dutie concerneth all students in diuinitie and all others which desire a good vnderstanding in the word of god and for their furtherance herein they must haue principall care to search into the text of scripture throughly thereby shall they best conceiue the proper meaning of the holy ghost and with greater facilitie keepe the same in memorie for one sayth truly that euery good minister should bee a good text man whereby is descried a common fault of many students who rather imploy themselues in the auncient writings of man than in the word of god nay many spend their best time in the base writings of wicked amp hereticall monks and friers it cannot be denied but many of the fathers were worthie members of god church but if the fountaine be left the ministerie will soone bee tainted with the filthie puddles of mens inuentions againe in this dealing of god with john we may obserue the truth of christs saying to him that hath it shall be giuen for though john was endued with rare knowledge and singular gifts yet the lord addeth more knowledge to his former the lord found him faithfull in the duties of an apostle and therefore reuealeth the knowledge of many secrets vnto him in most full manner euen so it is in god church at this day all that haue care to know the will of god and doe it though their knowledge be small at the first yet the lord will helpe them and adde dayly to their knowledge and the cause why many heare the word of god and profit not but wax worse or stand at a stay is because they labour not to haue their knowledge encreased by putting in practise that which they know for if they did then to him which hath should more bee added and hee should haue abundance as on the contrarie when we be negligent to heare or know and to obey the will of god wee haue a spirit indeed sent vpon vs yet not god spirit but the spirit of slumber of blindnesse amp ignorance so that we see and see not heare and vnderstand not isay on the lord day in these words is the fourth circumstance namely the time when this vision was shewed to s john this day which here is called the lord day among the iewes was the first day of the weeke called by vs sunday it is called the lord day for two causes first because on this day christ rose from death to life for christ was buried the euen of the iewes sabboath which is our friday and hee rested in the graue their whole saboath which is our saturday and rose the first day of the weeke early in the morning which is our sonday secondly this first day of the weeke according to the iewes account came in stead of the iewes saboath and was ordained a day of rest for the new testament and sanctified for the solemne worship of the lord and for this cause especially it is called the lord day the manifestation whereof as some thinke john chiefly intended in this title and touching this time for our better vnderstanding let vs consider three points first who changed the iewes saboath secondly for what cause thirdly whether the church hath now in the new testament power to change the saboath day we now celebrate to any other day of the weeke for the first it is commonly thought that the iewes saboath was changed into this lord day by christian emperours long after the ascention of christ but it is more consonant to the tenour of the new testament to hold that christ himselfe was the author of this change my reasons are these first that which the apostles deliuered and enioyned the church that they receiued from christ either by voyce or instinct for they deliuered nothing of their owne head but the apostles deliuered and inioyned this saboath to the church as to be kept a day of holy rest to the lord as appeareth corinthian where paule ordained in the churches of galatia and corinthian that the collection for the poore should be on the first day in the weeke this hee left not to the choise of the church but appointed it by authoritie apostolicall from christ now the day of collecting for the poore as appeareth in the history of the church was the saboath day when the people were assembled for god seruice for this was the custome of the church for many yeares after christ first to haue the word preached and the sacraments administred then to gather for the poore and for this cause in the writings of the church the lord supper is called a sacrifice an oblation and the masse not a reall sacrifice as the papists vse it but spirituall because therewith was ioined collection for the poore which was a spirituall oblation not to the lord but to the church for the releefe of the poore and it was called the masse because the collected releefe therat was sent to the poore saints abroad a second reason is this the apostles theselues kept this day for the saboath of the new testament act and it cannot bee proued that they obserued any other day for an holy rest to the lord after christs assention saue onely in one case when they came into the assemblies of the iewes who would keepe none other but the old saboath of the law a third reason is john the same day where n christ rose from death being the first day of the weeke e appeared to his disciples being gathered together and taught them many things which concerned the gouernement of his church and eight dayes after being the first day of the weeke hee appeared vnto them for the same end now it is more than likely that christ in his own person gaue them an example to celebrate and keepe that day wherein he rose againe for a saboath of the new testamen ii point the saboath of the iewes was changed for two causes first to maintaine the libertie of the church of the new testament whereof this was a great part tha they were freed from the ceremonies of the iewes for when this day was changed the church was no more tied to the iewes saboath neither had any such regard of dayes and times secondly that there might be a more fit time for the memorie of the worke of mans redemption for as god in the old testament appointed the seuenth day to be a day of rest to remember the first creation so in the new testament it stands with reason there should be a day to celebrate this worke of redemption which is a wonderfull creation wherein as isay saith are made a new heauen amp a new earth chap and wherby man become new creatures corinthian nay this redemption is a more glorious worke than the creation for in that creation adam was the head but in this redemption christ iesus is our head by the first creation wee receiued a temporall life but by redemption wee receiue life eternall in the creation adam was espoused to eue but in the worke of redemption euery christian is espoused to christ iesus by creation adam had an earthly paradise in this redemption we haue an heauenly kingdome in the creation god power and wisedom did principally appeare in this redemption with power and wisedome he shewed mercie and iustice iustice in christs passion and mercie in our forgiuenesse by creation he made man of nothing but by redemption hee made him of worse then nothing and better then he was therefore seeing this worke of our redemption is farre passing the creation it was meete a day should be set a apart for the memorie thereof now no day could be more fit then the first day of the weeke in which christ rose againe whereby he confirmed the worke of our redemption for he died for o r sinnes and rose againe for our iustification rom iii point whether may the church of the new testament chaunge this saboath day to any other day of the week as to tewsday wednesday ampc ans the church hath no such power for time is the lord and the disposing thereof is in his hands therefore christ saith to his disciples it is not for you to know the times and seasons which the father hath kept in his owne hands act as if hee should say the father hath kept times and seasons in hi owne power and therefore it is not for you to knowe them now if that were a good reason as no doubt it was then is this also sound and good if god haue the disposing of times in his hands then it belongeth not to the church to dispose of them but god hath the disposing of all times in his hands ergo and it may be otherwise hen e gathered thus if that which is lesse belong not to the church then that which is more doth not but the knowledge of time and seasons which god hath in his power belongeth not to the church which is lesse than the disposing of times and seasons and therefore the church hath not power to dispose of them and so by consequent may not alter the saboath day obiect in the old testament the iewes appointed festiuall dayes as the feast of dedication which christ kept holy ioh instituted by the machabees in token of thankfulnesse for their deliuerance and for restoring of religion and the temple which antioch had pulled downe and also mordichay instituted the feast purim which was celebrated of the iewes afterwards now if they had power to make holidayes then they might alter the saboath day and so may the church in the new testament ans these feasts of the iewes were no saboaths set wholly apart for the solemne worship of god but were onely daies of the solemnitie appointed by the church in token of ioy and thankfulnesse for the repairing of the temple amp deliuerance of god people and were onely celebrated as they serued to put the people in mind of these outward benefits so that whereas some hold that the church hath power to alter the saboath day or to make two more saboath dayes in a weeke if it were conuenient it hath no ground in god word for that authoritie which doth alter this day must not bee lesse than apostolicall and thus wee see why this day was called the lord day now if the first day of the weeke bee the lord day set apart for his honor in the memorie of so great redemption then here are three sorts of man reprooued first those that make the lord day a day of vaine pleasure and delight this is the manner of all sorts of man but especially of the yonger sort and servant who spend this day in carnall reioycing in riot gaming and wantonnesse neuer thinking of the worship of god which is then to bee performed but these sin greatly against the lord for hereby they peruert the end of the lord day it should be kept holy and glorious to the lord but they turne it to the worship and seruice of the diuell the second sort here reprooued are those which liue more ciuilltie than the former but yet they thinke they may do what they will on the lord day as to take their iourneys thereon and imploy themselues in their ordinarie affaires perswading themselues they may serue god with as good an heart when they are alone about their busines as they do who go to the church but these man sinne grieuously against the fourth commandement for hereby they make that their owne day which is the lord a third sort here reprooued though not so bad as the former are those who thinke it needfull to serue god at those ordinarie times of the saboath which the lawes of the land inioyne vnto man and therefore they will come duly to morning and euening prayer thinking that they are not bound besides to heare the word of god preached and that all the rest of the day they may doe what they will pertaining either to their profit or pleasure of this sort are our ignorant people and a great number euerie where but they sinne grieuously against god for the saboath day is called the lord day because it is wholly consecrated to his worship but they part stakes with the lord and giue him but a part of his owne day and that the less taking the rest vnto themselues which thee mispend vpon their lusts now as these vices must be abhorred so on the contrarie wee must with all conscience keepe the lord saboath holy according to th fourth commandement and therefore we must thereon cease from all workes of sinne and from the workes of our callings and sanctifie this day wholly by applying it all to the honour and worship of god and here we must remember that there is a double sanctification of the saboath publike and priuate publicke when man assemble themselues together publickly to heare god word for the increase of faith and knowledge and to call on god name for further graces as also to giue him thankes for his mercies and to receiue his sacramens priuate when man in their priuat places imploy themselues in holy duties of prayer reading and meditation vpon god word amp works whereby god is honoured and their soul edified and both these must bee performed to the lord euerie saboath day of euery man for wee may not abridge god of that tim wherein glorie should be giuen to his name if the officers should take our servant in the weeke day from our priuat businesse amp imploy them in publicke affaires wee would thinke much at it though it were for the common good and shall we not thinke that god will take himselfe dishonored of vs when we shall take either whole or part of his holiday and imploy it in our businesse a maine cause why many profit little by the publicke mininisterie is want of priuat sanctification of this day therefore we must learne to sanctifie the saboath of the lord for else we shal neuer increase in faith knowledge or obedience as wee should for the begetting and increase whereof this day hath beene set apart and sanctified from the beginning obiect why did the lord shew this vision vnto john rather on this day then any other answer though john were absent from the church in regard of bodily presence yet hee was present in spirit withall the faithfull and therefore no doubt on this day hee gaue himselfe to prayer and other duties which he could performe for the glorie of god in that solitarie place now it is the lord manner when his servant are thus humbled then to come and reueale himselfe vnto them in speciall manner so he did vnto daniel daniel and to cornelius act and to peter praying alone on the house toppe act and so doubtlesse finding john thus imployed this lord day he reuealed his will vnto him touching the state of the church to the end of the world hence we learne sundry instructions first whereas john being in a sollitarie island kept the saboath wee may obserue that all persons who are seuered from the assemblies of the church as the prisoners and those which are sicke of a dead paluesie or other great diseases as mariners though they bee in the middest of the sea should keepe holie the lord saboath by performing such duties as god requireth as prayer confession of sins and thanksgiuing whereby god may be glorified though they cannot come to the publicke ministerie of the word secondly in that john receiued his vision on the lord day when hee gaue himselfe to prayer and holie duties hence ariseth a consolation to god church that god draweth neere vnto them that draw neere to him as iames and so let vs humble our selues and draw neere to the lord by prayer and thanksgiuing and the lord in mercie will shew himselfe sundry wayes and draw neere vnto vs the cause why man haue so little tast of god mercie and loue towards them is because they do not draw neere vnto him by doing those duties which he requireth at their hands for when man draw backe from god is it not good reason hee should draw backe from them this therfore must stirre vp our harts and moue vs to come often to god by prayer and thanksgiuing for by vse in these duties shall wee get acquaintance with the lord thus much of the circumstances of this vision and i heard behind me a great voyce as it had bene a trumpet first here followeth the parts of this vision which are two the beginning or entrance into it in this verse and part of the twelft secondly the matter and substance thereof from the twelft verse to the end of the third chapter the entrance into the vision is a preparation whereby the lord maketh john more fit to apprehend and receiue the things reuealed in which preparation we must obserue first the meanes secondly the parts thereof the meanes whereby god prepareth him is a voyce and i heard a voyce the like manner of preparation hath god vsed in former times when hee intended to make with adam the couenant of reconciliation in the seed of the woman first he prepared him by a voyce speaking vnto him before he appeared and by this voyce caused him to slie for feare then hauing rebuked him for his sinnes he made with him this couenant of grace genes and in mount synai before the lord gaue the law hee first came downe in thundering and lightning and with the sound of a trumpet to terrifie the people and then hee vttered his law to moyses and to his people so when the lord would instruct samuel touching the house of elie he awoke him by a voyce again and againe and then spake plainely vnto him and in all visions vsually and generally the lord vseth to prepare his servant by voyces by signes and words that they might bee more fit to receiue such things as hee reuealed this dealing of god with john in preparing him to the worthy receiuing of this vision teacheth vs that wee much more should bee prepared to heare and receiue the will of god for wee come farre short of those excellent gifts of god which were in john who yet must be prepared our comming to heare god word is to learne the same for the increase of knowledge faith and obedience now the word of god is hard and we dull to learne wee must therefore by all good meanes prepare our selues that our minds and harts may be fit to receiue the same with profit the cause of so little profit after long hearing is want of preparation but hereof we haue entreated alreadie vpon the third verse this voyce is here set out vnto vs three wayes first by the place whence it came secondly by the qualitie of it thirdly by the matter and substance which it contained for the place it was vttered from behind him which the lord obserued to stirre vp re attention in john for vsually man doe more carefully marke those things which come on a sudden behind them than those which are spoken or done directly before their face secondly for the qualitie of it this voyce was great as is expressed further by a similitude like the sound of a trumpet that is full of power and maiestie which also god added vnto it to further attention in john for if it had beene an ordinarie voyce or small hee would not so much haue regarded it but being so sudden so great and full of maiestie it could not but make him verie attentiue now seeing christ is so carefull to prepare iohns mind with attention and diligence to receiue the things which should bee told him this teacheth vs that when we come to heare god word we must vse all meanes of attention for if it were needfull to john then is it farre more necessarie for vs who are farre inferiour to him in all gifts of vnderstanding and memorie and here also is another cause of small profit and little liking of god word namely want of attention in the heart wee must therefore like godly lydia act stirre vp our dull and heauie spirits and with all diligence marke the things wee heare and here we must take heed of two enemy to attention the first are by thoughts as when the body indeed is present but the mind wandereth from the word and is wholly possessed with thoughts of pleasure or other worldly affaires for these bee thornes in the ground of our hearts which choke the good seede of the word many will complaine they cannot marke and remember that which is taught now the cause is in themselues their wandering thoughts which hinder both vnderstanding and memorie for the mind conceiuing other matters cannot obserue how one point dependeth on another much lesse remember them afterward the second enemie to attention is dulnesse and heauinesse in body amp soule a common fault in many hearers which sheweth it selfe by drowsinesse and sleepinesse in the time of preaching when they ought to stirre vp their body and hearts to all attention if a man should bee dull and heauie when his prince is speaking vnto him of some weightie matter that is for his good it would bee taken for a part of contempt and disloyaltie towards his maiestie what disloyaltie then is this vnto the king of kings that we should bee dull and heauy when himselfe vouchsafeth to speake vnto vs out of his word the mysteries of our saluation and surely among other things this drowsinesse is one cause of small profit by the ministerie of the word and therefore if wee would encrease in knowledge and in the gifts of grace vnto saluation we must prepare our selues before we come and in hearing cast off all dulnesse of flesh and spirit and with all might stirre vp our selues to attentiue hearing so shall the word be blessed vnto vs otherwise our hearing shall turne to our deeper condemnation these words containe the third description of this voice whereby iohns heart was prepared touching the substance and matter which was vttered which consisteth in two things the first is a testimonie in these words i am alpha and omega the first and the last the second a commaundement in the wordes following that which thou seest write and send ampc i touching the testimonie the substance thereof is set downe in the eight verse where the words were handled and the meaning shewed they do serue directly to proue the godhead and eternitie of christ which christ himselfe doth here auouch to giue vnto john and vnto the church full assurance that the things now vttered and deliuered were from god for saying i am alpha and omega the first and the last it is as much as if he had said i which speake vnto thee am god and therefore the things i deliuer are from god in this testimonie note god speciall care in regard of his truth hee doth not content himselfe with reuealing his will vnto his church but more specially his care is to certifie the church of the truth thereof that it is indeed from god this hath beene god care from the beginning when peter receiued a vision from god withall god spirit assured him that the things reuealed therein were certen amp sure and so when christ preached the will of his father among man hee did withall worke strange miracles to confirme and seale vp the truth of his doctrine that it was from god this speciall care of god ouer his church doth first confute the papists opinion touching scripture they hold the scripture to bee certen in it selfe but not vnto man till the church giue testimonie thereunto but this is false for god euer had this care ouer his church not onely to reueale his will vnto them but also to vse meanes for the assurance of their consciences that that which was reuealed was his vndoubted and perfect will and therefore the word of god is certen and euer was not onely in it selfe b t to the consciences of beleeuers and that without the testimonie of the church and so should bee through the testimonie of the church should neuer come thereunto secondly hereby are confuted many carnall man who will be of no religion because say they there is no certainetie in the matters of religion mens opinions therein are so diverse that so many man so many minds almost and no man can tell who speakes the truth answer it may be that man in sundry matters hold sundry priuat opinions yet in the church of god all the true members of christ hold the same opinions touching the foundation of religion but let it bee graunted that all man on earth were of diverse opinions touching matters of religion should religion therefore bee vncertaine god forbid for religion is certaine vnto man by the meanes that god hath appointed to certifie the conscience of the truth thereof and thereby might man come to the truth and certaineti of religion taught by the prophets and apostles though all man in the world were of diverse opinions touching the same thus much of the testimonie ii point the commaundement giuen to john is in these words that which thou seest write in a booke and send it to the seuen churches which are in asia this commaundement hath two parts first to write the things seene in a booke secondly to send the booke to the seuen churches here named and both these must john do being now disabled by his exile to preach these things vnto them personally for these causes first that these churches might be edified in the faith and strengthened in these most grieuous times of persecution secondly that they might become keepers of this booke for the good of others for the church of god is the pillar of truth not onely for that it publisheth god truth but also because it keepeth it and giueth testimonie therunto in this commaundement note sundry things first that the word of god written and penned by the hand of man is a notable helpe to the church of god and a worthy meanes to edifie the same els christ would neuer haue commaunded john to haue written these visions and sent them to the churches which serueth to confute the blind papists which say the word written is but an inkie letter and a nose of waxe because the sence thereof may be turned euery way as man will this also confuteth the anabaptists which so much magnifie their reuelations and make no account of the word written if the lord had thought it best hee would haue taught these churches by reuelations but they must learne by the word written secondly that the reading of god word either publickly or priuately is an ordinance of god for the lord commaunding john to write this booke and send it to the churches hereby implieth that they must reade the same as they did other bookes of scripture the preaching of the word is indeede the most worthy instrument for the founding and confirming of god church whereby ordinarily iustifying faith is wrought in the heart and yet reading must haue his due reuerence as a meanes to confirme and encrease true knowledge faith and repentance where it is begun thirdly here note that a man may be vnder the crosse and in persecution and yet remaine in the speciall fauor of god for this banishment into such a desart place was vnto john a grieuous crosse and yet the lord vouchsafed there to reueale himselfe vnto him and to make him the penman of this booke which honour hee vouchsafeth not to all but to them that are most dear vnto him which thing each one should carefully obserue for our nature is so corrupt that when wee are vnder the crosse it would persuade vs we are cast out of the loue and fauour of god in the end of the verse the seauen churches ephesus smyrna and the rest are named which seuen places were seuen famous cities in asia wherein were planted the most famous churches that were in those parts and for their excellencie are they named and thus much for the meanes of iohns preparation now follow the parts thereof which are two first is hearing folded vp with the former meanes and i heard a voyce second is turning of himselfe to see the partie that spake vnto him in these words that is so soone as i heard this sudden and mightie voice i turned my selfe to see who it was that vttered the same in this behauiour of john we are to learne our dutie so to dispose our hearts towards god in the receiuing of his word as john disposeth himselfe towards christ in the receiuing of this vision so soone as the voice spake john hearkened and because the sound thereof came behind him he turned himselfe to looke on him that vttered it euen so must we doe we are by nature strangers with god slow to heare when hee speaketh and readie to turne our hearts from god when we heare therefore when god speaketh vnto vs in the ministerie of his word we must hearken and though we bee going another way yet wee must turne our selues from our euill wayes and encline our hearts to his voice that we may haue fellowship with him saint john had not seene this maruellous vision vnlesse hee had turned himselfe to behold him that spoke no more shall wee at any time feele true fellowship with the lord vnlesse we turne our hearts vnto his word and that betimes while he speaketh vnto vs in the ministerie thereof thus much for the first part of the vision viz the entrance thereunto the second part it the matter and substance of the vision containing a most worthie representation of christ in his maiestie as he is the prophet king and priest of his church set downe at large by a description of christ continuing from this twelfth verse vnto the end of the third chapter wherein john sheweth what hee receiued of christ partly by hearing and partly by seeing and first he beginneth his description of christ as hee saw him represented in vision and so describeth him by two arguments first by the place where he saw him secondly by his forme and figure wherein he appeared i for the place john saw him in the middest of the seuen golden candlesticks these seuen candlestickes here seene are the seuen churches of asia the particular churches of god being compared to candlesticks as christ expoundeth himselfe verse now the particular congregations of god church bee called candlestickes for that resemblance which is between them for as the candlesticks serue to bear vp and hold forth the light that is set therein so the particular churches of god on earth they beare vp and shew forth the light of the gospell vnto the whole world partly in the ministerie of the world and partly in the profession of the faith of christ from hence sundry things are to bee learned first obserue that the churches are rather called candlestickes than candles to giue vs to vnderstand that they haue no light of themselues or from themselues but onely are god instruments to beare vp and hold forth the light in the ministerie of the word and profession of the faith for christ iesus is the onely true lampe and candle that giueth light to the heart and conscience by his holy spirit in the word secondly hence euery one that professeth himselfe to be a true member of god church must learne his duty which is earnestly to labour to become a shining and burning candle indeed this principally concernes the ministers of the church and therefore john baptist is called a burning and shining light john verse but yet it must also bee verefied of euery member thereof as saint paule commaundeth philip shine sayth hee as lights in the world in the middest of a naughtie and c oked nation holding forth the doctrine of life that is the gospell quest how shall euery member of the church become a burning light answer first hee must haue his mind enlightened in the knowledge of god will and word and then as a candlesticke hold out and send forth the bea es thereof to others partly by teaching within the compasse of his calling and partly by example of an honest and blamelesse life and conuersation thus we should doe if wee would be answerable to our profession and to induce vs hereunto let vs obserue the reasons following first it is god commandement shine as lights sayth s paule in the world philip and walke as children of the light ephesian secondly consider the fruit hereof which is wonderfull great for by godly instruction in our places and by answerable obedience in our liues we win many to the lord shewing forth such lights whereby others may walke in this darke world to the kingdome of heauen which is a most blessed light in the winter season man thinke they doe others great pleasure if in the night they hang forth a light to guide passengers a little way in an earthly walke what a blessed thing then is this that a man should alwayes hold forth that light which shall guide a sinfull wicked wretch to leaue the wayes of death and to walke in the pathes of righteousnesse to eternall life but on the contrarie when man liue in god church like candles put out by reason of the blindnesse of their minds and the badnesse of their liues hence commeth great hurt and danger to others with whom they liue for they lead others that depend vpon them to the pit of destruction especially they who know the will of god and yet make not conscience to shew forth the same by good example of a godly life for as in an hauen towne if any man in the night time doe remooue the sea marke which guideth the ship in the right channell he doth as much as in him lieth cast away all the ship that are comming neere the shore by causing them to run on rockes and sands euen so they that should giue light in the church if they giue either no light or false light to such as depend vpon them who are sayling in the sea of this sinfull world hereby they lead and direct them to a wrong hauen and instead of heauen bring their soules to eternall perdition which must terrifie vs from ignorance and euill workes and make vs labour to shine as lights in this world by good instruction and godly conuersation third reason consider the fearefull iudgments of god against such as liue in his church as members thereof and yet giue no light they doe incurre the fearefull wrath of christ in the temple the keeping of the lampes and lights belonged to the priest and therefore he had his snuffers and other instruments to trim the same which notably figured the dutie of christ in the church of the new testament for hee is our high priest who looketh to euery light in the sanctuarie that is to euery member of his church who ought to shine as a lampe and when they burne but dimly and darke he hath his snuffers to trim them and make them giue a better light both by godly life and good instruction but when hee hath snuffed them againe and againe if still they burne darke and dim and giue either no light or else a false light then surely he will either cast them out of the temple or else tread them vnder his feete wee graunt this libertie to euery gouernour when hee hath light vp candles for his familie if any of them will not burne clearely he may snuffe it if that will not serue hee may cast it into the fire and set another in it place and shall wee denie to christ iesus the like authoritie in his church which is his house ouer man and woman who ought to shine as lights god forbid the minister therefore in his place and euery other christian in the compasse of his calling must labour to bee a shining candle both for knowledge and godly life before all the world that so hee may escape god fearfull iudgements in common reason we ought to carry our selues as shining lights before othe s it is an vsuall thing in the winter time to hang forth lights for the guiding of mens body safe from place to place now if we haue such care ouer their body wee ought to haue much more ouer body and soule both that by the light of grace in vs sinners and wicked man may bee guided in the darke and dangerous way of this world to the kingdome of heauen here then all ignoran persons and loose lu ers who abound in euery place must be admonished to reforme themselues and labou to become lights in god church they stand as candles but they are extinct nd giue no light to others ignorant persons therefore must cast off their ignorance and labour for knowledge and wicked liuers must reforme their loosenesse of life and become obedient to the word truth that so they may shine vnto others if a man haue a candle set vp in his familie and shall assay to light it and snuffe it once or twice and cannot get it burne then in displeasure he will trample it vnder his feete or cast it into the fire euen so christ iesus seeking to enlighten the minds of these ignorant persons and to reforme the liues of these loose liuers by the ministery of the word when he shall perceiue that they refuse the light and will not bee reformed vndoubtedly in furie of his wrath hee will at length psalm plucke them from their places and stampe them to powder and cast them to hell many be ignorant in euery place and moe be prophane and small is the number of good shining lights but wee must remember our duty and walke worthie our calling if we hold foorth the light of knowledge and obedience we shall shine as the firmament in the world to come daniel golden candlestickes the churches of god are not base candlestickes but candlestickes made of gold there bee two causes of this resemblance first because gold is the most excellent of all mettals so god churches here on earth are the most excellent of all societies the company and societies of man in families townes and kingdomes and in other common affaires of this life be the ordinance of god and good in their kind but yet the societie of saints in the church of god doth farre surmount them all and that in these respects first because in god church saluation may be obtained but in other societies as they are societies though sundry benefits arise from them yet saluation is not to bee had in them vnlesse they bee either particular churches as members thereof secondly the church of god is the end of all other societies and they are all ordained to preserue and cherish the church which is the societie of the saints thirdly the church beautifieth all other societies the principall praise and dignitie of any towne houshold or kingdome is this that they are either churches of god or true members thereof from this preheminence of the church we are taught aboue al things to labor to become true mebers of this society man haue great care to become mebers of incorporations amp towns of greatest priuiledges but few there be that seek for the priuiledges of god church and commonly those that seeke most for priuiledges in chiefe townes haue the least care to become the true members of god church which is a wretched practise and ought not to be among vs seeing the church hath priuiledges farre aboue all other societies secondly hence we are taught aboue all things to haue care to preserue the societie of the church of god true it is the minister and magistrat must haue cheefe care thereof and yet euery man in his place must doe his best indeuour hereunto because it is the most principall societie thirdly in that god church is the most excellent societie giuing honor to all others we are taught within the compasse of our callings as much as we can to bring all other societies vnto this those that are members of a familie must labour to bring euerie one in their familie to bee good members of the church and so in ciuill societies man of gouernement must labour that the members of the ciuill body become also members of christs bodie thus gouernors of kingdomes should labour that the parts of their dominions may be particular churches of god and there is good reason of this dutie because all other societies without this are companions of man in the darke sitting in the shadow of death being spiritually blind and without all sound comfort in their soules secondly the church is compared to a candlesticke of gold because of all societies among man it is most precious amp deere vnto god and therfore it is resembled to a seale cant on christs heart and a signit on his arme yes it is a deare vnto him as the apple of his eye zachar the church is the queene that stands on christs right hand in a vesture of gold psalm yes that which surpasseth all christ redeemed act the church vnto himself by his owne bloud oh then how deere and pretious is she in his sight and hereby also wee are taught the same instructions that did arise from the former preheminence namely to haue special care of god church to preserue the same and to labour to become our selues and to bring others to be members thereof and thus much of the title of the church now it is added that christ the messias is in the middest of the seuen golden candlestickes whereby is signified first that christ is present with his church at all times and secondly that being present he hath care to gather his church and being gathered to preserue the same against the gates of hell and all other enemy from hence we learne sundry things first that the supremacie of the church of rome wherein one is made head of all the militant church is needlesse for christ is present alwaies with his church hauing speciall care to gather guide and preserue the same and hee needeth no vickar generall to supplie his roome for in the presence of the prince all commissions of vicegerencie doe cease though christ had granted this supremacie to any yet so long as christ is present their commission must cease and it is as great pride and greater for any to presume to be head of all churches in christs presence than for a man to sit vicegerent in the presence of the prince secondly seeing christ is alwayes present with his church wee are taught to walke with god and before god as enoch did genes which duty stands in these points first whatsoeuer we say or take in hand wee must do it as in the presence of christ secondly we must continually depend vpon christs providence who is euer present with his church prouiding all things for the good of his church and of euery member therof thirdly we must do all our actions as looking for approbation at the hands of christ for which end wee must take direction for the same out of his word the practise of this dutie is most excellent for by walking with god we shall be enabled to many good duties as namely liue vnblameably in this wicked world making conscience of all sinne and approuing our selues both to god and man in hart and life and thus much for the place where john saw christ the second argument wherby john describeth christ is his figure or forme in these words one like the son of man some thinke that these words are a description of some angell not of christ because he is sayd to be like the son of man not the son of man himselfe but they are deceiued for he which is here described is before called the first and the last it is he which was dead and is aliue which cannot agree to any but to christ now the words may more significantly bee translated thus one like to a son of man for if it be translated that son of man then christ must needs bee the resemblance for so hee is called act but here christ is sayd to be like to a son of man by the vsuall phrase of the old testament whereby is meant that he is like vnto a man and christ is not here called a man but is sayd to bee like vnto a man because hee appeared vnto john not in his true manhood which was then in heauen but in the likenesse of his manhood and note this that as christ here appeared to john in this vision so did he alwayes appeare after his ascention steuen indeed saw his true manhood act but it was in heauen and paul heard his voice when he was conuerted acts and saw the lord corinthian but no man can prooue that chrst appeared vnto him in his true manhood vnlesse it were in heauen and in all these visions john saw not his true manhood but a resemblance thereof now christ appeared thus for speciall consideration for man is too much addicted to his bodily presence this was the fault of his owne friends and disciples therefore christ would hereby teach vs not to seeke for his bodily presence but rather to lift vp our hearts to heauen and therefore seeke to haue fellowship with him by faith for this cause he sayd to marie after his resurrection touch me not i am not yet ascended to my father john this paule had learned though we had knowne christ saith he after the flesh yet henceforth know we him no more corinthian now if christ after his ascention neuer appeared in his true manhood i teacheth vs that the defence of christs reall presence in the sacrament is needlesse for if god church haue spirituall fellowship with christ by faith it is sufficient againe whereas christ appeareth in the shape and forme of man after his ascention the papists gather that wee may make images of christ and so answerably of the father and of the holy ghost in those formes wherin they appeared as of the holy ghost in the forme of a math doue and daniel of the father in the likenesse of an old man ans it is not unlawful to make or to haue an image of christs manhood so that it be out of religious vse though it bee doubtfull whether any now haue a true picture therof but if it bee to represent whole christ god and man or bee vsed to remember christ thereby or to worship christ therein it is an idoll as for the formes of an old man or of a doue they may bee made for the manifestation of the hystori of the bible when it is painted or pictured but then wee must conceiue that these formes are no images of the father son or holy ghost but onely representations of such visible appearances as sometimes were signes and pledges of the presence of those persons but now to abstract those formes apart from the hystorie and to make them images of any person in trinitie is flat against the second commaundement which doth generally forbid all images of god not excepting those very shapes in which himselfe tooke libertie to testifie his presence for some time and there being no exception against god comaundement it is in vaine to seeke shifts amp excuses for a thing forbidden specially considering wee may not meddle with god beyond our commission from god clothed with a garment downe to his feete here christ is further described by his attire the first part whereof is a long garment reaching to his feete the causes why he so appeared may be these first to signifie that hee is the high priest of the new testament and so continueth doing the offices of the high priest for his church after his ascention in presenting the merit of his one onely sacrifice and making intercession to god the father for them for the long garment was one of those wherewith the high priest was cloathed in his ministration vnder the law secondly to signifie that hee is the prince of peace for the long garment not onely in the church of god but among the heathen hath beene alwayes a note of peace and so christ is called isa thirdly to shew that he had in his breast the coloss treasures of the wisedome of the father and the isay spirit of counsell for this long robe alwayes pertained to them that excelled in counsell and wisedome and so christ is described isay now in this example of christ we may learne a dutie touching our attire namely that the outward garment of the body should be sutable to the good things that ought to be in the heart as to our wisedome knowledge feare of god name to our sobrietie modestie temperance humilitie and all other vertues whatsoeuer wee must not onely in speech and action as in hearing god word and receiuing the sacraments shew our selues to bee burning lights but euen by the gesture and attire of our body both for matter and forme shew forth the grace of our harts but miserable are these times wherein mens attire is sutable not to the graces of god that should bee in their hearts but to the common corruptions of the times for such it is generally whereby a farre off though hee neuer had acquaintance with the partie a man may see the vanitie and lightnes of his mind the pride and folly of his heart that weareth it the second part of christs attire is this girded about the pappes with a golden girdle it hanged not loose about him but was girded close to his body whereby is signified that he is a mediatour euery way readie prepared to doe the office of a mediator for his church for in all ages the luke girding of the attire to the body hath beene a signe of care and diligence in the businesse they haue in hand and the contrary not girding a signe of carelesnesse and negligence therein when christ was here on earth hee was most pitifull to all penitent sinners he reiected none such that came vnto him but regarded them far more than the scribes and pharisees that were the learned man among the iewes and since his assention hee hath not left off his care and diligence but is alwayes ready doing a such duties which may pertaine to their saluation the consideration whereof is a matter of excellent comfort vnto all such as haue any sparke of grace first hereby wee learne that when wee truly humble our selues christ is ready to receiue ou prayers and in all our troubles amp temptations ready to relieue to comfort and deliuer vs and in our death ready to receiue our soules yes at all times prepared to doe whatsoeuer may further our saluation hee is not like vnto pharoahs butler who promised to remember ioseph while hee was in prison with him but forgate him quite when he was aduaunced to honour againe but he is alwayes mindfull of vs and euer readie to doe all the workes of a mediatour for vs whence wee are taught answereably to haue our loynes girded as christ commaundeth luke verse being euer ready to doe all duties that concerne christianitie as to call on god name and to praise god to practise faith repentance and obedience fit to die and fit to liue neuer suffering our selues to bee vnfit for any thing that concernes our saluation but at all times so stand vpon our watch that whensoeuer god shall call we may bee readie to enter into the kingdome of heauen but alas the case with most man goeth farre otherwise they fit themselues for the world at all times but few seeke to prepare themselues for the kingdom of heauen till death do come this ought not to be it is a treacherous part in any subiect to bee vnprepared for the seruice of his prince and yet euer readie to receiue a common enemy and it is no lesse treason against god to forslow our preparation for the lord by fitting our selues for the world further he is sayd to be girded not about the loynes but about the pappes and breast whereby some say and not vnfitly is signified that there is no defect or aberration in any motion or affection of our sauiour christ but euerie thought and inclination of his hart is kept in order by the fulnesse of the spirit which dwelleth in him bodily in the third place john here describeth christ by the parts of his body the whitenesse of his head amp haires signifieth the eternitie of christ for howsoeuer as hee is man he had a beginning yet in regard of his godhead he is eternall and therefore is called the antient of dayes daniel and is sayd to haue beene in the beginning john that is to haue had a beeing before all other things had their beginning in this resemblance of his eternitie by head and haires as white as wooll and snow hee giueth vs to vnderstand an honour and prerogatiue in the aged man whereby he excelleth the yonger sort to wit the horenesse and whitenesse of his haire for which cause in the word of god it is set forth by most worthie comparisons as by the white almond tree ecclesiastes and by a glorious siluer crowne not made by man but by the hand of god set vpon his head and herein doth this excellencie of the aged consist that they beare the image of god eternity before all that are of yonger yeares from whence all yonger man are taught to reuerence the aged by ev rising vp before them acknowledging thereby the preheminence of the hoare head againe hereby the aged are taught to carrie themselues answerable to their estate and condition they ought to excell all their yongers in knowledge wisdome and experience of good things john i write vnto you fathers that is aged man who by reason of yeares are fathers because you haue knowne him who is euerlasting also they must be holy as hee that is eternall is holy whose eternitie they shew forth and therefore salomon saith the white head is a crowne of glorie when it is found in the way of righteousnesse that is in one that walketh in the way of righteousnesse prover for his white haire signifieth that hee hath spent much time and care about good duties but it is no ornament vnlesse it be ioyned with holinesse of heart and life which i say because many yonger man excell the aged in the knowledge of god amp other vertues which is a shame to the gray headed for as they go before others in yeares so they ought to excell in pietie knowledge and all vertues ignorance and loosenesse of life is a foule vice in any but in him that bares the siluer crowne it is intollerable for how can they looke for reuerence from the yonger when as they bee farre inferior to them in gifts of grace it is no excuse for old man to say their wits are not so ripe as young mens are and their memorie failes them their aged ignorance argueth that they spent the time of their youth loosly and prophanely for they that be planted in the house of the lord shall bring forth fruit in their age psalm a plant is young and therefore he that would weare the crowne of glory in his age must receiue the sap of grace in the house of god while hee is young and his eyes were as a flame of fire here john proceedeth in describing the parts of christs bodie in the handling whereof it is hard for any to set downe certainely what the holy ghost intendeth in euery particular it shall be sufficient for vs to follow that interpretation which is most probable and best agreeing with the tenor of god word in this description of christs eyes are signified to vs two things first that christ the mediator and redeemer of his church is of most quicke sharpe and piercing sight so as hee beholdeth all things that are done vpon the earth yes he seeth into the very secret thoughts of mens hearts thither can the eyes of his godhead more easily pierce than fire can doe into the substance of bodily things and there is great necessitie it should be so for being head and gouernour of his church he must know all the parts and members thereof he must behold their seuerall estates and see the malice and practises of sathan and other enemy against them now in that christ our sauiour hath this piercing sight we are taught to haue care not onely of our words and actions but also of the very secret thoughts purposes and desires of our hearts for the piercing eye of christ seeth them all therefore we must be sure they bee well ordered in the courts of man thoughts and inward motions beare no action but with god it is otherwise christ iesus hath a fierie eye that seeth into all our thoughts and there hee holdeth a court of iudgement therefore we must keep a godly watch ouer all the imaginations of our hearts that they may be approued of christ least for them wee bee iudged and condemned secondly this teacheth vs in matters of religion to bee that indeed which we seeme to bee in profession for though wee may deceiue man which know not our hearts yet we cannot deceiue christ for by his fierie eyes he seeth whatsoeuer is in vs and yet the common practise of the world is here to be reproued who tearmeth them hypocrits that take vpon them any profession for the name and religion of christ but herein man goe beyond their calling it belongeth onely vnto the piercing eye of christ to iudge and looke at mens hypocrisie of heart secondly by these fierie eyes is signified that christ is full of anger wrath and iudgement against all sinners readie to take vengeance on all those that will not yeeld subiection vnto him by turning from their sinnes and beleeuing in him for christ as he is a sauiour so is he a iudge and therefore in the parable he sayth those mine enemy that would not that i should rule ouer them bring them hither and stay them before mee the consideration hereof serueth to awake many an one out of the sleepe of sinne this age is miserable if wee regard the practise of faith and repentance which god requireth for man liue in ignorance without knowledge they goe on in loosenesse of life without reformation which is both scandalous vnto man and odious vnto god not one of an hundred turneth to god at the preaching of his word renewing his wayes by dayly repentance but vnto many it is meat and drinke to go on in those sinnes wherein their harts delight but let these man consider that christ is a righteous iudge beholding his enemy with fierce and fierie eyes alwayes readie take vengeance on them that doe no repent and therefore they must in time consider their estate for if they perseuere in their euill wayes as they haue begun the truth is hee still beholdeth them with his fierie eyes and though in his great patience hee spare them for a time yet at length he will put in practise the execution of his iudgement and slay them for enemy as it is in the parable luke let them remember what a fearefull thing it is to fall into the hands of god if his wrath bee kindled neuer so little psalm the word in the originall signifieth brasse that shineth which for substance is pure and durable a very choise and excellent kind of brasse and hereunto christs feet are compared to signifie vnto vs his inuincible power whereby hee is able not only to encounter with sinne sathan and death but also that hee hath alreadie entered combat with them and hath bruised the heads of these his enemy yes hereby is signified that hee hath not onely done these things in his owne person but also will doe the same in all his members by his inuincible power vnto the end of the world which is a matter of exceeding great comfort to god church and people neuer to be forgotten if any man be exercised in any grieuous temptation of sathan hee must not be astonished and confounded therewith but remember that christ our sauiour hath the brasen feet wherewith hee hath bruised the head of the serpent and will if hee seeke vnto him vnfainedly bruise in him the serpents head so by experience shall we find the benefit of his brasen feet if any be oppressed with the corruption of his nature whether it bee in thoughts or affections let him come vnto christ iesus lay open his wants before him shew his sinnes and make knowne the strength thereof vnto him and withall crie vnto him for helpe and hee shall find by ioyfull experience though they were neuer so many or mightie that the power of christ in him will vanquish and subdue them all againe doth any feare the terrours of death as all man doe by nature let him consider that christ hath the feete of brasse wherewith he did encounter with death vpon the crosse and not content with that went downe with him into his owne denne and there did bruise his head and subdue his power indeed if death were to encounter with vs in his full strength it were a matter of feare but considering that christ hath bruised his head this must stay our heart against ouermuch dread and as it serueth to minister comfort to the godly so it is a matter of all terrour and woe vnto those that liue impenitent for christ hath feete of brasse to bruise the head of all his enemy and such are all those that go on in sinne vnlesse they turne destruction will bee their end let euery one therefore looke vnto his soule that hath led a course in any sinne let him forsake his old master sathan and the workes of darkenesse and turne vnfainedly to iesus christ in the practise of faith and true repentance and by all obedience in the duties of his callings for howsoeuer the patience of god may stay for a time the execution of his iustice and wrath yet in the end they shall feele by wofull experience the destroying power of these his brasen feet burning as in a furnace feet ascribed to god and man in scripture doe oft time betoken their wayes so here by christs feete wee may vnderstand his workes and wayes and whereas they are said to burne as in a furnace thereby is signified the perfection thereof all the counsels of god with the execution thereof in the creation and gouernment of the world with all his works therein are all most holy amp pure like fine brasse purged in the furnace psalm the waies of god are vncorrupt yes hee is holy in all his wayes the consideration whereof must teach vs to conceiue and speake reuerently of all the workes of god euen of those most secret amp strange iudgements whereof we cannot comprehend a reason yet because they proceed from god wee must acknowledge them pure and iust in sundry points of religion there is a learned ignorance whereof this is not the least to hold our selues content and to reuerence the workes of christ though wee see no reason thereof nay though to vs they seeme against all reason for all the wayes of god are vncorrupt though the blind eye of man cannot discerne the light of the sun yet the sun is full of light so though our blind eyes cannot e old the puritie of god workes yet they are all done in iustice and equitie yes they are iustice it selfe for his will is the rule of iustice and we must not thinke that god doth a thing because it is good and right but therefore is the thing good and right because god willeth and worketh it examples hereof wee haue in god word gen god commaunded abimele to deliuer sarah to abraham or els hee will destroy him and all his houshold in mans reason this might seeme vniust for why should abimelechs servant be punished for their maisters fault so achan sinneth and all the hoast of israell is punished dauid committed adulterie and the child which he begat eth dauid numbreth the people but the people are smitten with the plague sa all this to mans reason may seeme vnequall yet being the workes of god we are withal reuerence to iudge them most iust and holy againe the rom scripture sheweth plainely that god in his eternall counsell hath decreed to saue some and to reiect others and his reason mouing him thereto is not any thing foreseene in them but his will and pleasure alone this in mans reason seemeth to be crueltie towards some and therefore sundry man disclaime this doctrine as charging god with iniustice and tyrannie but herein they greatly offend for it is the manifest truth of god in his word amp therfore ought with reuerence to be acknowledged though we can see no reason thereof for who article thou oh man that pleadest against god rom and his voyce as the sound of many water the voyce of christ is resembled to the sound of many water for two causes first to signifie the loudnesse and greatnesse of it the sound whereof hath bene heard through all the world in the ministerie of the gospell secondly to shew the power and efficacie thereof in the eares of his creatures for such power it is of that when the creatures were not he but spake the word amp they were made he this powerfull voice of christ brought john lazarus out of the graue after he had bene dead foure dayes bound hand and fo e and by this voyce of christ shall they that haue bene dead six thousand yeares before be raised vp to life the houre shall come in the which all that are in the graues shall heare his voyce and shall come forth to iudgement john hereby then we may see the great securitie and the deadnesse of mens hearts in this age for though the powerfull word of christ be daily sounded into the eares of many yet it entereth not into their hearts they liue securely in their sinnes though they be daily exhorted to repentance but shall dead lazarus start out of his graue when christ saith lazarus come forth nay shall they that were consumed to dust many thousand yeares before at the hearing of christs voyce rise out of their graues and shall we which liue in body bee no whit affected with it in our soules oh fearefull death in sinne and yet this is the state of all those that will not bee mooued to leaue their sinnes by the ministery of the word it may bee the outward eare receiueth the sound but the dead heart receiueth no instruction we must therefore apply our hearts to this powerfull voyce of christ and leaue the sinnes wherein we haue lien dead that so the quickning power hereof vnto saluation may appeare in vs here john proceedeth further to set out the parts of christs body and the properties thereof by seuen starres wee are to vnderstand seuen angels that is as christ expoundeth them verse the seuen ministers of the seuen churches of asia and they are called starres for these causes first starres giue light to man on earth and so the ministers ought to giue spirituall light to them that liue in the church both by doctrine and by an vnblameable conuersation secondly starres haue their continuall abode in heauen and descend not vnto the earth so ministers aboue all others ought to haue their conuersation in heauen this indeed is the duty of euery christian but especially of the minister in regard of his calling and this heauenly conuersation he must expresse first by seeking the conuersion of his owne soule and then the conuersion of others that they may haue an eternall mansion in heauen thirdly they are called stars because if they be faithfull they shalbe honored of god and made to shine a the starres for euer and euer daniel it is added that they are in christs right hand whereby is signified that to him belongeth the regiment and gouernement and the whole disposition of the ministerie for matters that concerne the church from whence arise sundry instructions i that it is christ who giueth to his church ministers which preach the gosspell for he ascendeth vp on high and gaue gifts vnto man some to be apostles some prophets and evangelists some pastors and teachers for the gathering together of the saints and for the worke of the ministerie and for the edification of the body of christ and for this cause we ought to pray daily vnto christ that he would thrust forth laborers into his haruest that the remnant of god elect may bee gathered and so we see an end of these miserable dayes wherein we liue secondly in that christ holdeth them in his right hand wee may gather that christ giueth protection and defence vnto his ministers when they are faithful and walke in their calling according to his will which is a matter to bee considered of al that are called into this office for they haue sundrie occasions of discouragement as the negligence and backwardnesse of their people the slanders and mockings of the enemy but this protection of christ must comfort them against them all seeing they are in christs right hand they must go on with all godly boldnesse thirdly this sheweth the dignitie of this calling indeed it is despised and reputed base in the world and hereby many are driuen from it but let the wicked iudge what they will behold christ honoureth it for his faithfull ministers are not onely present before him which were no small thing but hee holdeth them in his right hand then which what greater glorie can be done vnto them this must bee an inducement vnto all those that are indued with gifts fit for this calling to affect the same lastly euery minister of the gospell must hereby learne to bee faithfull in his calling and holy in his conversation for by vertue of his calling hee is placed in christs right hand now shall we thinke that christ wil long bear in his right had any that are vnfaithfull or prophane nay he will take them out of his right hand and put them vnder his feete of brasse and there grind them to powder for as they are honoured aboue others by their place so shall their confusion be the greater vnlesse they be faithfull this wee may see in nadab and abihu leuit and hoph and phineas sam and in the same respect ought all the people of god to be carefull to their wayes for by their calling of christianitie they be members of christ now if they be not faithfull and answerable to their profession hee will surely deale with them as with vnfaithfull ministers put them vnder his feet of brasse amp confound them for euer they must therefore make conscience of all sin and become not hearers onely but doers of his will so shall christ protect them in this life and saue them eternally and out of his mouth went a sharpe two edged sword this sword that came out of his mouth is nothing else but the doctrine of the law and the gospell vttered and propounded in the writings and ministerie of the prophets and apostles heb the word of god is liuely mightie in operation and sharper than any two edged sword and it is thereto compared because as a sword with a double edge entreth sharply into the flesh and pierceth deeply into the bones euen to the very marrow so the doctrine of the law and the gospell entreth sharply and pierceth deepely into the very marrow of the heart of euery man to the diuiding of the thought and the spirit this two edged sword the word of god hath a twofold operation one vpon the wicked another in the elect it woundeth the wicked at the very heart with a deadly wound and thereby brings them to eternall death isay christ shall slay the wicked with the breath of his lippes that is with his word which is this two edged sword herewith shall he consume antichrist thes visit leuiathan and slay the dragon that is the greatest enemy of his church isay verse here consider how the word of god should kill an impenitent sinner there be three degrees of spirituall death first in this life where an impenitent sinner receiueth his deadly wound the second at the end of this life when the bodie is laid in the graue but the soule goeth to the torments of the damned the third at the end of the world when bodie and soule together go to hell eternally now a sinner receiueth in this life his deadly wound after this manner christ in the giuing thereof hath a threefold worke in his heart by the ministerie of his word which is this two edged sword first hereby he reuealeth vnto him his sinnes as hypocrisie pride and rebellion of heart with all other his horrible and damnable transgressions against the first and second table corinthian when all prophesie and there commeth in one vnlearned he is reproued of all the prophets by the word iudge him and thereby lay open vnto him the secret sinnes of his heart with the sinnes of his life secondly christ hereby reue leth vnto him his indignation and wrath which is the curse of the law due vnto him in which regard the law is called corinthian a killing letter shewing no mercy but onely thundreth out the fierce wrath of god vpon transgressors thirdly hereby christ awaketh his guiltie conscience sharpneth the sting thereof and terrifieth him at the hearing of his word thus wicked felix trembled when hee heard paul preach act of temperance righteousnesse and the udgement to come so when king daniel belshazzer saw the palme of the hand writing things against him vpon the all his countenance was changed his thoughts troubled him his ioynts were loosed and his knees stood one against another and al these are wrought in the wicked without apprehension of mercy or reformation of life it may please god to recouer one that s wounded but while he is this estate hee hath receiued a deadly wound and without vnfamed repentance is alreadie in th first step toward eternal death for these horror o conscience seuered from the apprehension of god mercie in christ are no grace but the flashes of hell fire and the beginning of eternall woe and thus we see how christ by this sword woundeth his enemy hence we are to learne sundry duties first how to earne our selues towards them that after they haue heard the word preached vnto them will rage and storme against it and the preachers therof because it touched them we must not despise or maligne them but rather be mooued with compassion towards them for this their behauiour is a token they are wounded with the sword of christ at the verie heart and these their ragings are nothing but struglings before death eternall vnlesse the lord in mercy recouer them of this deadly wound ii hereby wee are let to see and know the lamentable state of the greatest number in those congregations where the word hath long bene preached for we shall find by lamentable experience that in those place few come to true knowledge repentance and obedience but most remaine ignorant and impenitent now this their condition is most fearefull a terrible iudgement of god is vpon them for when man haue long heard god word and are not thereby bettered for knowledge in mind and obedience of life they are thereby wounded vnto death this two edged sword hath alwayes his worke it either cureth vnto life by working repentance and other graces of saluation or woundeth vnto death them that receiue it not we must therefore lament the case of such persons as remain ignorant and impenitent vnder the ministerie of the word for they are as yet dead man for ought wee know how soeuer they may make a faire shew by their ill honestie if any man should come into a field and there behold many thousands slaughtered and ou blo d some in the ead some in the side ampc this sight would make his heart to bleed wel this god church though it be not seene with bodily eyes the most man are wounded with this sword of god word and lye wallowing in the blo d of their soules they continue in ignorance in se uritie and want of repenta ce iii this m st admonish vs all to labour earnestly to haue further things wrought in vs than a knowledge of our sinnes an apprehension of wrath o horrour of conscience namely faith and repentance and sound reformation of life for without this wee haue nothing in vs but the deadly wounds of christs enemy and much for the worke of the word vpon the wicked the second worke of this two edged sword is in god elect in them it hath sundry workes all which end to their subiection first it woundeth to the quicke the corruption of their nature this is one speciall cause why it is called a two edged sword because it entereth deeply into the heart of god children and giueth their corruption such a deadly blow as it shall neuer recouer againe it killeth not the person as it doth in the wicked but quic ening the soule it woundeth his corruption paule ministred the gospell that the offer vp of the gentiles might be acceptable where resebling god church to a sacrifice hee giueth vs to vnderstand that euery true christian must be slaine though not in body and soule yet in regard of sinfull motions corrupt affections and rebellious actions by this two edged sword of the spirit and this is his conuersion whereby the roote of corruption is stocked vp secondly after conuersion this two edged sword serueth to cut off and pare away the remnants of vnbeleefe doubting impietie anger and other sins that be in the elect euery branch saith christ that bringeth forth fruit in mee my father the husbandman gruneth to make it bring fo rth more fruit thirdly it serueth to keepe god children in awe and subiection vnto him in this vision christ standeth in his church holding vp the scepter of his kingdome which hee beareth in his mouth for this end that though his enemy will not bee brought in subiection vnto him yet his owne children might hereby be kept in awe of him he therefore that will not at the lifting vp of this two edged sword tremble and feare before christ is but a rebellious subiect if there bee brawling in humane societies let the magistrate but shew himselfe with the sword of iustice and straightway euery one is quiet if any resist he is taken for a rebell now shall this be effected in ciuile policie and not bee true in christs spirituall gouernment vnlesse therefore wee will shew our selues rebels against christ let vs cease from sinne and tremble before him seeing hee holdeth out vnto vs the scepter of his word fourthly this sword serueth notably for our defence and victory in all temptations ephesian this sword of the pirit the word of god is one piece of the complete armour of a christian herewith did christ vanquish sathan matth and thus wee see how the word of god is a two edged sword in regard of the elect hence we are taught that when wee haue the doctrine of the law and of the gospell preached vnto vs we must with all reuerence heare and receiue the same man will heare it while it is taught generally but if it once touch their particular faults then they cannot brooke it but wee must suffer it to ransacke our hearts and be glad thereof for by this meanes our corruption is wounded and sinne slaine in vs our soules are conuerted vnto god and shall bee saued if any man were diseased with a fistula or any other dangerous sore he would willingly suffer the surgeon to search and pierce into the fame shall wee doe this for our bodily health and shall wee not suffer the word of god to enter into our hearts to rip vp our sinnes that they being wounded and subdued wee may bee healed and so our soules liue for euer wee cannot liue vnto god till wee die vnto sinne and wee can neuer die vnto sinne till the same bee wounded in vs by this two edged sword away therefore with all nicenesse in disliking the word when it crosseth our humour and if wee loue eternall life let vs then embrace it most willingly saint john sayth f ther of this two edged sword that it came out of christs mouth other kings carry their swords and scepters in their hands but christ beareth his in his mouth to teach vs this speciall point that wee must receiue no doctrine from any man which hee hath not receiued from th mouth of christ for first god reuealeth his will vnto his son amp christ deliuereth it vnto his prophet and apostles by the spirit and to his ministers in their writings they therefore must deliuer nothing vnto god people but that which they haue from christ if they deliuer ought els they hold no forth christs sword neither can it haue that powerfull effect either in the godly or in the wicked and his face the sun shineth i his brightnesse here is the last braunch of this description of christ his face is compared to the shining of the sun and that in his strength because christ is vnto his church as the sun is to the world and looke what duties the sun performeth vnto the world the same duties christ performes vnto his church in a more excellent manner as their resemblance will euidently declare first the sun in the world dispelleth night and darkenesse and maketh the day by bringing light so christ the son of righteousnesse malach sendeth downe the bright beames of knowledge and grace into his church wherby blindnesse and ignorance is taken away corinthian and hereby euery one of what sort or place soeuer is taught first to labour for knowledge of the will of god a great shame it is for any to bee ignorant her in when the day commeth we set open our windowes to let in the light of the sun for our comfort behold christ iesus is euer a shining light in his church why then should wee not open our hearts that the beames of light and knowledge which descend from him may enter into vs and giue vs light secondly wee must hereby learne in our whole conuersation among man to walke by this light we are here but pilgrims trauelling towards heauen and the way of this miserable word is full of darkenesse yet christ iesus is in the middest of his church shining as the sun in his strength to giue the light of knowledge whereby wee may see the right way thither without him there is nothing but darkenesse and wandering his word is the light and himselfe the day starre we therefore must attend vnto him in all our affaires of this life and in the particular duties of our lawful callings take direction from the light which shineth from his face secondly the sun serueth most excellently to comfort and reuiue cold and dead starued body as experience in the spring time teacheth so christ iesus by the worke of his spirit conueyeth spirituall life and heat nto the dead and frozen heart of man he is of power to comfort them that mourne to giue life to the broken hearted and to reuiue the spirit of the humble isay and for this most excellent worke may well bee called the sun of righteousness in regard wherof wee must labour aboue all things to bee partakers of this life and ioy which commeth from christ in winter time man vse to stand in the sun to comfort and warme themselues with the heat thereof behold christ iesus is the sun of righteousnesse to his church which giueth heat and life to all the true members thereof wee therefore must seeke aboue all things to haue his blessed beames of grace to shine vpon our cold and frozen hearts that by his spirituall heat we may be reuiued vnto euerlasting life in this world nothing is so much regarded as riches honours and pleasures who will shew vs any good is the worldlings song but with godly dauid wee must say psalm lord lift thou vp the light of thy countenance vpon vs quicken thou vs with thy spirituall life and comfort vs with the beames of mercy quest how may i get the gracious beames of grace and life to come from this sun of righteousnesse into my heart answer before a man can liue by christ hee must bee killed in himselfe man doe not kill those whom they would restore to temporall life but the lord taketh that course thou therefore must suffer his two edged sword to enter into thee yes to bee thrust vp to the hilts into thy heart that so thy vile sinnes and corruptions may be ripped vp and the wrath of god deserued thereby made knowne vnto thee that in thy selfe thou mayest bee out of hope and then and not before article thou fit to receiue comfort and life by christ as a man that is cold in bodie is most fit to receiue heat by cloathes and other meanes of warmenesse now being thus humbled in thy selfe thou must vse the meanes which god hath ordained to wit the hearing reading and meditating in his word with earnest prayer for grace and mercie and th shalt thou perceiue the ioyfull beames of life shining into thy soule if a man had all the world and wanted this grace of life and comfort by christ it were but a curse vnto him but though a man want all things els yet by this life of grace in christ he is blessed for euer and therefore aboue all other things man should labour for it thirdly the sun serueth to discouer all things in the night nothing is discerned but al things appear in one form but when the same commeth forth all things are made manifest euen the all motes in the aire euen so christ iesus the son of righteousnesse he seeth all things and can discouer the most hidden secrets of man nothing is hid from the light of his countenance so infinit is his diuine wisdome and knowledge in regard whereof we must bee moued to looke vnto all our wayes both thoughts words and actions that they bee such as christ approueth for though we may deceiue the world by a false glosse yet all that wee do speake or thinke is naked and bare before him he knoweth the same amp can and will reueale it if this were beleeued and remembred it would be a meanes to suppresse much fraud and iniustice and many grieuous sinnes which is rise in the world man thinke if they can bleare the eyes of the world all is well they may do what they will but we must thinke vpon the shining face of christ which discerneth and discouereth all secrets and labour thereupon to make conscience of all our wayes yes of our secret thoughts that god may approoue the same verse and when i saw him i fell at his feete as dead then hee laid his right hand on me saying feare not i am the first and the last verse and i am aliue but i was dead and behold i am alive for euermore amen and i haue the keyes of hell and of the earth here saint john describeth christ further by other arguments namely by sundry actions of his the first whereof is a confirmation of john being sore afraid set downe in this amp the next verse in which action note two things first the occasion therof secondly the mean of his confirmation the occasion was iohns exceeding feare set downe in these words and when i saw him i fell at his feete as dead the meanes of confirmation as in the words following then hee layed his hand vpon me ampc for the occasion iohns feare was exceeding great and that of death as appeareth by christ his confirmation wherein he telleth john that be liueth and hath power ouer death in this his feare note sundry points the cause the effect and the kind of this feare for the first the cause was christ his appearancen glo ry and maiestie vnto john set downe in these words when i saw him where we learne that sinfull man since adams fall cannot abide the presence of god gen adam before his fall talked face to face with god without feare but so soone as he had sinned gen bee fled away at the hearing of his voyce and hid himselfe among the trees of the garden this feare commeth by reason of mans guiltinesse before god hence manoah sayd vnto his wife iudg wee shall surely die because wee haue seene god first by this that no sinfull man can abide the presence of god we are taught to labour to become new creatures to haue the image of sinne defaced in vs and the image of god restored in righteousnesse and true holinesse true happinesse consisteth in fellowship with god but wee can neuer haue true fellowship with him while wee liue in our sinnes john if wee say we haue fellowship with him and walke in darkenesse we lie we therefore must labour to bee purged from our sinnes and so his presence shall bee our ioy secondly this feare of john at christs presence in glory teacheth vs that the sight and presence of god maiestie is a most excellent meanes to humble a man and to make him know himselfe to bee nothing in himselfe when abraham talked with god the more hee beheld the maiestie of god the more hee humbled himselfe confessing at last that he was but dust and ashes gen and peter by a great draught of fish seeing but a glimmering of diuine maiesty in christ could not abide it but cried out depart from me for i am a sinfull man luke and so the holy angels when they stand before the maiestie of god are sayd isay to couer their faces and their f ete with the wings to signifie that they are nothing in regard of the exceeding maiestie of god and in themselues vnable to behould his glorie thirdly hereby wee are taught to acknowledge god great goodnesse towards vs in the ministerie of the word wherein hee vouchsafeth to speake vnto vs not in his owne person as hee did in mount s rra which would bee so terrible none could abide it but fauorably amp familiarly by the ministerie of man that are like vnto our selues many abuse this mercy of god and despise the word because of the messenger but wee must learne by this bountie of god to receiue the word with all reuerence as from the lord lastly in this exceeding feare of john who was an apostle and a very godly and righteous man wee learne that the most holy man that is will be astonied euen to death with the presence of god glorious maiestie and if no man be he neuer so holy can stand before god presence much lesse can the most righteous workes of any man endure the triall of his iudgement if his person cannot abide his presence his workes will neuer beare his iudgement for the person must first bee approoued before the workes be accepted therefore damnable is the doctrine of the church of rome which teach that such as in themselues are sinfull man must stand before god iudgement seate bringing with them works of grace as meanes of their iustification and part of satisfaction to god iustice it is a doctrine of desperation for how can our works be perfectly holie seeing our persons are but sanctified here in part and who can thinke that the infinit iustice of god can bee satisfied by the imperfect righteousnesse of man ii point the effect of this feare in his body he fell downe as dead at his feete this was no small feare but exceding great astonishing his senses and laying him downe as dead physitions say and that truly the mind followeth the temperature of the body but hence we may as truly say that the body followeth the disposition of the mind for the affections of the soule wil worke vpon the body like vnto strong diseases iohns feare casteth his body into a sound and so horrour of conscience when the heart is cold will make the body hot and the intrals to roule in the body the same may be sayd of anger regina when ahab could not obtaine nabals vineyard he layd him downe on his bed in displeasure and was almost dead euen so will other affections worke vpon the body hence wee learne that the body of man being diseased must not alwayes be cured by bare physike but somtimes by curing of the mind and ordering of the affections for when the distemper of the body ariseth from the disorder of the mind then till the mind be well composed and setled physicke will little auaile iii point the kind of this feare is insinuated in these words he fell at his feet wherby the holy ghost giueth vs to vnderstand that this was a religious reuerent feare which hee bare to christ for this kind of prostrating the body betokeneth humilitie and argueth a reuerent estimation of the thing feared hence we are taught when we come into the presence of christ we must prostrat our selues as john did and looke that we be striken with a religious feare of his maiestie if any shall thinke that christ is now ascended into heauen and therefore we cannot now fall down at his feet as john did i answer though christ be now in heauen yet hath he his feet vpon earth at which we must fall downe in the old testament the mercy seat was the pledge of god presence and therefore it is called god footestoole psalm before which the iewes were to fall downe well though the mercy seat be now taken away yet some thing is instead thereof for wheresoeuer god people assemble themselues in the name of god there is his footstoole and therfore in the assemblies of god saints we must cast downe our selues before christ iesus and do all duties vnto him with all feare awe and reuerence of his maiestie this feare of john though it was holy yet is it tainted with some sinne and corruption for it was an immoderat feare of death which made him thus astonished and affright whence wee learne that the most holy affections of righteous man are not per ectly holy but mixed with imperfection according to the measure of their sanctification which is alwayes in part in this life whereby it appeares that no man hath in him a filiall feare of god alone but some seruile feare whereby wee feare god for his iudgements is mixed therewith and thus much for iohns feare which is the occasion of his confirmation now followeth the meanes of his confirmation in these words then he layd his right hand vpon me saying feare not i am the first and the last and i am aliue but i was dead and behold i am aliue for euermore amen and i haue the keyes of hell and death here note two things first the time when christ vsed these meanes for iohns confirmation secondly the means themselues the time is noted in this word then that is after his presence had stroken a feare in my heart which made me as dead then the lord vsed meanes to comfort me the meanes of comfort and confirmation are then vsed when the party is humbled and thus the lord dealeth with all his servant in the matter of their saluation first he bruiseth their stonie hearts and woundeth their sinfull soules before hee powreth in the oyle of grace first a man must bee a lost sheepe and then christ findeth him and layeth him on his shoulders and bringeth him home and indeed they that would feele sound comfort by christ must first be humbled in themselues and the reason why man reape so little comfort either by the word or sacraments is the want of true humiliation before they come whereby the soule is fitted for grace and consolation ii point the meanes vsed by christ to confirme john and they are two first a sensible signe he layd his right hand vpon me secondly comfortable words feare not here first obserue in generall christs gratious dealing with john he vseth not one meanes apart but in great mercie that he may throughly confirme john he giueth him both a signe and words and so hee hath alwayes dealt with his servant when he called moses to bee a deliuerer of his people first hee gaue him his word saying i will be with thee and then a signe saying vpon this mountaine shal ye serue god ex d so when he would confirme the heart of esay ahaz against his enemy he first giues him a promise of deliuerance verse then biddeth him aske a signe verse and for this cause christ in the publishing of his gospell added signes and miracles vnto his word that the truth thereof might be fully confirmed and so in the worke of our saluation besides his mercifull promises which were sufficient in respect of his fidelitie he giueth vs further signes and seales to support our weaknesse and to confirme our faith in the assurance thereof euen the vse of the holy sacraments this teacheth vs that christ hath a speciall care ouer his church and people in that he doth so condescend and abase himselfe vnto their weaknesse adding vnto his word which of it selfe were sufficient signes and tokens that by both he might more euidently giue that assurance which by one alone our weaknes would not so well conceiue againe in this meanes of confirmation note the order which christ vseth first he giueth him the signe of his presence laying his hand vpon him to assure him of protection fro al danger of death the he giueth him his wrod bidding him not to feare hence we may learne that the assurance of god presence and protection is a souerigne remedie against all feare when moses feared the great calling he was sent about to take away that feare the lord saith exod i will be with thee hence dauid saith psalm he will not feare though he walke through the valley of the shadow of death because god is his stay and comfort wherefore it concerneth vs to labour to be assured not onely of god presence but of his prouidence and speciall protection and so in all dangers both of life and death wee shall haue stay and comfort for our soules the lord hauing vsed these two meanes to confirme john both a signe amp his word doth yet further condescend vnto iohns weaknesse and establisheth his owne word by two reasons the first in these words i am the first and the last christ is the first because nothing was or could bee before him the last because nothing is or can bee after him these two titles are giuen vnto christ to expresse his godhead and eternitie as before wee haue heard verse now here they are againe set downe to giue vs to vnderstand that hee hath in his owne power the beginning and end of all things and therefore is able to protect his servant from all dangers and from death and will make good vnto them all his promises vnto eternall life these words conteine the second reason to confirme john and it may thus be framed by way of a distinction although i was dead yet i am he that liueth for so the words are and behold i am aliue for euermore amen yes i haue power ouer death and hell this distinction containeth three parts first though i was once dead yet i am he that liueth secondly though i was once dead yet i liue for euermore thirdly though i was once dead yet i haue the keyes of death and of hell of these in order i part and am he that liueth though i was dead here life is ascribed to christ in a speciall manner for christ liueth in a peculiar sort differet fro the life of other creatures for first hee hath sufficient life in himselfe and from himselfe secondly he giueth life to others for the first that wee may better conceiue it wee must know that life is twofold vncreated and created vncreated life is the life of god whereby god liueth this life is eternall and infinit in it selfe amp from it selfe now as christ is god he liueth this vncreated life which is all one with the godhead againe created is twofold the first is naturall preserued by means of meat and drinke the second is spirituall both begunne and continued by meanes of the immediat operation of god spirit whereby wee haue fellowship with god and this spirituall life is more perfect than the naturall now christ liueth not the naturall life but as he is god liueth the vncreated life amp as he is man he liueth the spirituall life his body and soule hauing al their subsisting and sustentation in the second person in trinitie and therefore he hath in himselfe most absolut and perfect life and so liueth of himselfe secondly christ is here said to liue because he giueth life vnto man amp that two wayes first as he is god and so he giueth life to all good and bad for in him euery thing liueth moueth and hath his beeing act secondly as he is mediator god and man and so he giueth spiritual life vnto his church and people hence he saith to his disciples because i liue yee shall liue also john for looke as christ died not for himselfe but for vs that we might not die eternally so hee liueth now in heauen the spirituall life not for himselfe alone but for vs that we might liue that spirituall life in and by him eternally and therefore our life is sayd to be hid with god in christ and for this cause in the sacrament we doe eate the body and drinke the bloud of christ really by the mouth of faith that wee might know that our life is to be fetched from him for as we receiue grace from his grace so wee receiue life from his life hereby wee are taught to seeke for this spirituall life at christ hands that we may say with paul i liue not now but christ li eth in me gal and that our life id in christ as in a head and roote for he liueth in heauen that wee might liue by him our care must not be so much for our temporall life which is but a vapour and like a fleeting shadow as for this spirituall life which is eternall but the practise of this duty is rare to bee found though the omission of it bee a grieuous sinne mens whole care is for temporall life few thinke on this how to procure to themselues this spirituall life by christ though he haue said i liue that you may liue in me this appeareth by their common practise they will goe ten twenty yes an hundred miles to prouide means for their bodily preseruation and yet will scarce go one or two miles for the meanes of their saluation for euer the cause thereof is the hardnesse of mens hearts which are not touched for their sinnes nor feele the smart amp weight thereof this we may see plainly in the woman of samariah for when christ sate at the well of iacob talking with her and telling her that he was the well of life of whose water whosoeuer dranke should neuer thirst she did nothing but cauill with him but when he layd to her heart her principall sinnes then she left off cauelling and in reuerence and some beginning of faith acknowledged him to be the messias euen so let the minister say vnto his people hee can bring them to the water of life they will nothing regard but cauill at the doctrine of the gospell till their sinnes bee touched and their soules humbled by the sight thereof wherefore if wee would haue our hearts fit to receiue spirituall life by christ we must first labor to haue a sense of our sinnes and to feare god wrath due vnto vs for the same hereby we shal be weined from the dangerous loue of earthly things and our soules shall bee rauished with desire of christ iesus he is the well of life and if once we could feele a parching heat in our soules by reason of our sinnes then would we thirst amp neuer be at rest till we had drunke our fill and dined our selues in his sauing merits this naturall life is but vanishing and therefore we must labour for this spirituall life by christ which is eternall this will comfort vs in all distresse and take from vs the feare of death of hell and all danger the second part of the distinction though i was dead yet behold i liue for euermore amen this part is vttered and propounded by two notes to bee obserued first by a note of certaintie amen secondly by a note of attention behold the note of certaintie amen serueth to assure vs that this is an infallible truth which christ affirmeth of himselfe saying i liue for euermore the note of attention which is prefixed behold serueth to stirre vp iohns mind and the mind of euery one of vs to a serious consideration of this which christ saith i liue for euermore and because it pleaseth christ to propound this point in this manner let vs a little stand thereon and herein consider two points first in respect of what nature christ is sayd to liue for euer secondly for what end he liueth for euer for the first no doubt as christ as the mediator of the church he liueth for euer and therefore this must bee vnderstood of christ in regard of both his natures godhead and manhood in respect of his godhead he is coeternall with the father and with the holy ghost liuing of himselfe that vncreated and essentiall life which is all one with the godhead being eternall without beginning or ending secondly hee liueth for euer as hee is man for after his death hee ascended vp to heauen where in full glorie he inioyeth immediat fellowshippe with the godhead for in him dwelleth the fulnes of the godhead bodily his manhood being wholly and immediatly susteined by his godhead ii point the end for which christ liueth for euer is to giue eternall life to his church and to euerie true member thereof so saint john saith this is io the testimonie of god euen the father that hee hath giuen vs life euerlasting and this life is in that his son and here christ must bee considered of vs as the head of his church as the roote and ground of our saluation and the fountaine of all our happinesse for as the roote of a tree liueth not for it selfe but for the body and for all the branches euen so christ iesus he hath eternal life in him not for himselfe alone but that he may conuey the same to al his members yes wee must consider christ as the common treasurie amp storehouse of all true felicitie wherein life eternall is laid vp for al the members of his church for which cause hee saith ioh his flesh is meate indeed and whosoeuer eateth his flesh and drinketh his bloud shall liue for euer to giue vs to vnderstand that his manhood hath quickning vertue in it yet not of it selfe or by it self but as it is the mahood of the son of god for from the godhead it receiueth this quickning power to giue eternall life vnto the church and here the meanes must be considered by which christ giueth life vnto his church namely by vertue of that misticall vnion which is betweene him and euery member of his church which vnion is thus caused god the father giueth christ vnto his church and to euery one that is to be saued by christ and that really and truly according to the terror of the couenant in which he hath promised to giue christ with all his benefits to euery one that beleeueth the manner and order of this gift is this whole christ god amp man is giuen to euery beleeuer euen as he is mediator and yet the godhead of christ is not giuen with the manhood but only the vertue amp operation of the godhead in the manhood by which the manhod is made able to merit for the beleeuer but the manhood of christ is giuen both for substance and in regard of all benefits that are conueyed to man by it as iustification and redemption as truly as lands and goods are giuen of man to man and when god giueth christ to any he doth withall giue vnto the same partie the spirit of christ for hee that hath part in christ hath part in his spirit and this spirit createth in his heart the instrument of faith by which christ giuen of the father is receiued and apprehended both his body and bloud and the efficacie and the benefites thereof christ is not receiued in imagination as man receiue things by conceit in the braine but as hee is giuen of the father namely in the word and sacraments really and truly though spiritually and the same spirit that worketh this faith doth knit the beleeuer vnto christ really though mystically making him one with christ so as christ is the head and the beleeuer a member and thus is this mysticall coniunction wrought from whence proceedeth this eternall life the benefites that come from this mysticall coniunction are these i hereby a beleeuer begins in this world to liue eternall life for by the worke of his spirit christ maketh that man that is thus vnited vnto him to begin to die vnto all sinne and to liue vnto him spiritually as himselfe liueth ii hence commeth the resurrection of the body for this coniunction being once begun remaineth eternall and is neuer wholly broken off no not from the body while it is consumed to dust and ashes looke as in the winter season the sap returneth to the root of the tree and then all the branches seeme as they were dead but when spring time commeth by vertue of the sun the sap ascendeth and maketh them fresh and greene againe euen so the body of god children haue their winter season while they lie dead and rotten but yet by vertue of their vnion and coniunction with christ at the last day shall life bee conveyed from christ iesus vnto them whereby they shall be raised to life iii hence commeth eternall life to euery beleeuer that is glory and blisse in body and soule in heauen for euer and euer for being once begun as it is in this world it is neuer dissolued and thus we see how christ conueyeth eternall life vnto his members the words bearing this sence do containe in them the foundation of two maine articles of our beleefe namely the resurrection of the body and life euerlasting for both these are effected to vs by vertue of our vnion with christ for he liueth for euer to giue life to vs and this is the ground of all true ioy as wee may see in iob who in the middest of his miserie stayed himselfe on this that hee knew his redeemer liued and that hee should rise againe and behold him with those same eyes wherewith he saw other creatures iob againe if christ liue in heauen to giue vnto vs eternall life then must wee learne to haue our conuersation in heauen with christ for where our life is there should our conuersation bee now that our conuersation may be with him wee must often seriously consider with our selues of this euerlasting life which christ there keepeth in store for vs and for this cause principally doth christ here say behold i liue for euer this also must mooue vs to put all our affiance in him and to place all our ioy and reioicing in him man haue most regard to that part of their bodie by which the whole body and euery member liueth well wee professe our selues to bee members of christ and in him is hid our spirituall life wee therefore must set our hearts and affections on him especially the third part of the distinction is this though i was dead ye i haue the keyes of death and of hell here we must not imagine that hell is a bodily place kept with locke and key and dores as mens dwelling houses are that cannot bee proued by any place of god word neither yet that the torments thereof are bodily such as bee inflicted in this world but rather they are spirituall being the apprehension and feeling of god wrath and vengeance whose iealousie burnes like fire but christ in this phrase borroweth a comparison from stewards of great houses who at their installing into their stewardships haue the keyes of all things giuen vnto them which giuing of the keyes is a token of regiment and authoritie bestowed vpon them and the meaning is this that iesus christ thogh he once died yet by his death did vanquish hell and death and hath obtained full power amp dominion ouer them both for euermore hence arise sundry instructions first that power and authoritie to forgiue sinnes properly belongeth onely vnto christ no meere creature hath this power for hee that can forgiue sinnes must bee able to take away the punishments of sinne namely hell and death which none can doe but christ alone who onely hath the keyes thereof and to say that a man can properly forgiue sinnes is to say that a man hath power in himselfe ouer hell and death and therefore the priesthood of the church of rome is full of blasphemie who take vpon them properly to pronounce vnto man the pardon of their sinnes of themselues and they deride the custome of reformed churches who from god pronounce the pardon of sinnes vnto them that repent secondly hereby wee are taught to reuerence christ and to performe vnto him all due honor and loyall obedience if wee neuer haue done this heretofore wee must now begin and if wee haue done it we must endeuour to do it more for christ hath the keyes of hell and death hee can open the gates thereof at his pleasure and cast thither whom hee will many deceiue themselues through their false conceit of christ they thinke not of him as of a iudge but as a sauior onely they make him all of mercie and pitie and thereby they take occasion to goe on in sinne but wee must consider that christ is likewise a righteous iudge who hath the power of hell and death in his hands and therefore we must not flat our selues in our euill wayes but striue to please him continually with fear and trembling least by our sinnes we stir vp his wrath against vs and cause him to cast vs into hell whence is no redemption thirdly this is a matter of great comfort vnto all those in god church that in this life vnfainedly cleaue vnto christ and especially in time of affliction and temptation and at the houre of death for christ hauing the keyes of hell amp death is able to keepe them from hell and from the sting of death and this hee will doe because they trust in him for he hath promised it if this were alwayes sounding in our eares it would minister endlesse ioy vnto our soules against the seruile feare of hell and death here s john propoundeth a second action of christ for hauing confirmed john against his great feare hee giueth him a commaundement to write the things which he had seene ampc this commaundement was giuen to john in the eleuenth verse and is here againe repeated for these causes first that john might see the special care of christ ouer his church that he still continueth a prouident head thereof for their good estate after his ascention secondly that god church in all ages may vnderstand that it is necessarie man should know the estate of the church to bee subiect vnto troubles that thereby they may better arm themselues against the euils to come thirdly that john might be fully assured of his calling to write and publish this booke fourthly that god church in all ages might be out of doubt that this booke is no deuice of man but a booke of god and part of holy scripture reuealed from christ to john for the good of his church if it be sayd though christ did faithfully reueale his will yet john might erre in publishing it answer as christ deliuered this to john so hee receiued and published it faithfully without all fault either in matter or manner for we must make a difference betweene the prophets and apostles and all other teachers as the prophets in former times so the apostles in the new testament were called immediately by christ and had such speciall assistance of god spirit that they could not erre when they propounded by preaching or writing any doctrine of christ vnto the church of god this appeareth by the promises of christ made vnto them luke he which heareth you heareth me and be which refuseth you refuseth me and e which refuseth me refuseth him that sent me againe matth it is not you which speake but the spirit of your father speaking in you ioh hee promiseth to send his spirit to be their comforter which shall teach them all things yes to lead them into all truth john which promise some apply al god ministers but if we marke the circumstances therof we shall see that properly it agreeth to the apostles for though in others the certaintie hereof cannot be affirmed yet in them it may for which cause in the counsell at ierusalem thus they write vnto the churches it seemed good to act the holy ghost and to vs as being assured of the certaine direction of the holy ghost which no ministers euer since could say being subiect to errour both in speaking and writing this distinction must bee held for the certainetie of our faith in the points of religion and for our assurance of the faithfull penning and publishing of this booke and thus much of the causes of this repetition in the words of this commandement is contained the diuision of this whole booke write the words which thou hast seene that is set downe what i haue shewed thee in this vision and which are that is all things which i reueale vnto thee touching the present estate of the church and which are to come hereafter that is those things which concerne the future estate of the church to the end of the world as i will reueale it vnto thee thus then is the whole booke distinguished i it containeth things touching the present estate of the church in iohns da es ii it entreateth of things which concerne the future estate thereof from iohns time to the end of the world hence obserue the lawfulnesse of the article of logicke for diuisions be lawful else the holy ghost would not here haue vsed them and so by proportion are other arguments of reasoning and therefore that article which giueth rules of direction for the right vse of these arguments is lawful and good those man then are farre deceiued who account the arts of logicke and rhetoricke to be friuolous and unlawful and in so saying they condemne the practise of the holy ghost in this place this is the third action of christ namely the interpretation of the vision in the principall parts thereof which he expoundeth for these causes first john in this businesse was to shew himselfe a prophet of god by declaring the present and future estate of god church now the principall part of a prophet is to expound visions or dreames reuealed either to himselfe or to others as wee may see in daniell and the rest of the prophets secondly that john might bee encouraged in the publishing of this booke and of the things reuealed vnto him for iohns calling respected the church of god and when he should perceiue these visions to concerne the churches this would stirre vp his diligence in obseruing and penning the things reuealed now christ expoundeth not the whole vision but two principall things therein namely what was meant by the seuen starres to wit the seuen angels or the seuen ministers of the churches and what was meant by the seuen golden candlesticks namely the seue churches theselues the reasons why both were so called wee haue showed before with the vse therof here onely i will obserue these three points first why christ in the interpretation of his vision doth not expound the whole but onely two principall parts thereof this he doth for these causes first because hee hath giuen vnto his church the gift of interpretation which hee would haue them to exercise about this vision for if hee had expounded euery part himselfe then he had left herein no matter to his church whereabout shee might exercise her gift secondly to prouoke god ministers especially with other members of his church vnto all diligence in studying this and other parts of scripture for if all things were easie and plaine then man would grow carelesse in reading and searching out the knowledge of god word thirdly to stir vp in euery reader of this booke an earnest and hartie desire to vnderstand the same fourthly to excite all his servant to prayer and inuocation vpon god for his grace that they may with reading the scripture vnderstand the true meaning thereof ii point note here the ministers of the churches are called angels what these angels are appeareth in the chapters following to wit the pastors and ministers of these seuen churches of asia so mat john baptist is called christs angell or messenger whereby wee haue good light for the expounding of a place in paule corinthian saying that the woman ought to haue power ouer her head that is bee couered because of the angels where by angels may well bee vnderstood the preachers and ministers of the gospell and the reason of that precept may bee this among the corinthians the couering of the head was not as it is with vs a token of prelieminence and superioritie but a signe of subiection and therefore the apostle would haue the woman of corinthian when they came into the congregation to haue their heads couered according to the custome of their countrey in other assemblies to signifie their submission and reuerence vnto the ministerie of the gospell whereas ministers are the lord angels and embassadours hence wee gather that euery minister of the gospell must carry himselfe as the messenger of the lord messengers haue regard of two things of the matter of their message and of their manner of deliuerie that they speake all which they are commanded and in such order as their lord and master would haue it spoken or speake it himselfe if hee were present and he that faileth in either of these may iustly bee chalenged of vnfaithfulnesse the minister therefore being christs messenger must deliuer the whole will of christ alone vnto his people as also in that manner which christ approoueth and would himselfe obserue if hee were present now can we once imagine that christ would deliuer his will partly in english partly in latine and other languages or intermingle with the testimonies of the prophets and apostles the sentences of fathers of philosophers poets and other writers those therfore that in this sort dispence christs gospel doe hereby bewray vnfaithfulnesse in their deliuerie indeed this is counted the learned kind of preaching but it is not that manner which christ approoueth and besides if this kind of teaching may take place it will bring in as great barbarisme in regard of true diuinitie as was among the schoolemen when god word was wholly turned vnto needlesse disputation yes it would shortly banish the gospell out of this land iii point note the phrase which the holy ghost vseth he sayth not the seuen starres signifie the seuen angels but are the seuen angels and the seuen candlestickes are the seuen churches giuing to the signe the name of the thing signified wherein wee haue a good warrant for our exposition of that phrase in the sacrament this bread is my body this cup is my bloud which the papists vnderstand properly of the very bodie and bloud of christ by reall transmutation but as these seuen starres are sayd to bee seuen ministers because they did signifie the seuen ministers so is the bread called the body of christ because it signifieth and representeth his bodie and the cup his bloud and as it is absurd to say the seuen ministers were indeed seuen starres because they are so called so it is absurd to hold the bread in the sacraments to be really christs body or the wine his bloud because it is so called and thus much of the third action of christ in the interpretation of this vision in this chapter and in the next is contained the fourth action of our sauiour christ wherein he giueth seuen particular commaundements to john to write vnto the seuen churches of asia and to send vnto them seuen letters or epistles the first of which commandements is expressed in the beginning of this first verse vnto the angell of the church of ephesus write then after followeth the epistle these things saith hee ampc continuing to the eight verse first for the commaundement the partie to whom john must write is the angell which word may bee expounded two wayes either to signifie the minister or pastor of the particular church of ephesus and so it is commonly taken of the most or els it may be token the company of the ministers teachers and gouernours of the church of ephesus for therein were many pastors and gouernours as appeareth act where paule calleth together the bishops as the word signifieth and giueth them charge ouer their particular flockes now in scripture the name of one person taken collectiuely oftentimes signifieth the whole multitude as exod israell is my son euen my first borne where the whole body of the people of israel is called by the name of one man and so though antichrist bee not one particular man but a state and company of man in the succession of popes yet is that whole estate noted by the speciall name of one man as that thes antichrist that man of sinne and son of perdition thus we see how the word angell may bee taken and whether wee vnderstand it of one man or of the whole company of elders it is not much materiall in this particular commaundement note two points first that christ his intent is to write to the whole church of ephesus as appeareth chap where john is commaunded to write in a boohe and send it to the churches as also by the conclusion of this epistle where it is sayd let him that hath an eare to heare heare what the spirit saith vnto the churches and yet he directeth his epistle not to the whole church but particularly to the angel or pastor therof this he doth for two causes first to intimate vnto this minister his duty which stood in two things in teaching the contents of this epistle vnto the whole church amp in becomming a patterne and example to them all of doing the things therin required secondly because either much good or much euill comes to euery particular church by the ministers thereof such is the efficacie of his place and calling if he be faithfull he bringeth great good to the church if vnfaithfull exceeding great hurt as might easily be proued by many examples in all ages now christ writeth to the angell of this church that he might be a meanes of much good vnto them al by exciting them to the practise of all good duties required in this epistle ii point among all the churches of asia christ writeth first to the church of ephesus not for that this church had authoritie ouer the rest for they were all candlestickes and all of gold but because ephesus was the mother citie farre exceeding the rest in riches and estimation whereby christ giueth vs to vnderstand that his will is that those people towns and cities which excell others in estimation and wealth should also go before them in knowledge obedience and other graces of god and so answerably should it bee with particular persons they which excell others for outward reputation and temporal blessings ought to go before them in spiritual graces as godlinesse and religion those which shall faile herein and suffer others that are far their inferiours for outward things to go before them in spiritual graces shall find it true to their shame before man but especially at the tribunall seat of iesus christ thus much for the commandement now followeth the example it selfe which containeth three parts as all ordinarie epistles doe a pereface a proposition and the conclusion the preface is in these words these things saith he that holdeth the seuen starres in his right hand and walketh in the middest of the seuen golden candlestickes the proposition and conclusion in the verses following the preface is borrowed from the former chapter verse and where also it was handled the intent of christ herein is to draw this church to a reuerent adoration of his person and to cause in them a greater care to embrace and obey his admonition this appeareth by that twofold action which he auoucheth of himselfe to wit his holding the seuen starres in his right hand and his walking in the midst of the seuen golden candlestickes by the first whereof is signified his power in protecting and gouerning his ministers and by the second is noted his presence in the middest of his church guiding and blessing his ministers with all the members thereof as if he had sayd if i be he that haue power to protect and gouerne that am present also to blesse and direct both ministers and people then my admonitions are to be reuerenced and obeyed in this preface note two special points first that christ here againe repeateth that which was before deliuered touching his presence in his church and his mightie power and prouidence ouer the same in protecting guiding and blessing both minister and people by which reputation hee would giue vs to vnderstand the specall weight and moment of this point to wit that it ought to be ingrauen in the harts of euery one in god church and indeed till we be persuaded thereof wee shall neuer learne religion soundly the ground of true religion is this to take the true god for our god and christ iesus for our redemer and it consisteth not in a swimming notion hereof in the braine but in the sure persuasion of the heart which we neuer haue till we be resolued both of christs presence with vs and of his prouidence ouer vs for our blessing and defence ii point in this preface also note that the persuasion of christs presence and speciall prouidence in his church is a notable meanes to draw vs on to all good duties for thereby christ would persuade both the ministers and people of ephesus to receiue and embrace this his epistle and no doubt he that is indeed persuaded hereof cannot but bee moued to walke before god in all holinesse and obedience as did enoch abraham and all the godly patriarkes thus much for the preface here beginneth the second part of this epistle to wit the proposition containing the substance and matter of the whole epistle this proposition hath two points first a commendation of this church in the second and third verses secondly a rebuke and reprehension in the fourth verse the commen ation is first generall in these words i know thy workes then more particular for special duties amp actions in the words following and thy labour and patience ampc for the first i know thy workes many doe expound this of workes of mercie and liberalitie but that wil not so well stand for he saith to euerie church i know thy workes and yet some of them are blamed for want of these good workes by works then is meant the wayes that is the practises and dealings of the whole church as well of ministers as people in all their affaires also by knowledge here we must vnderstand a knowledge that goeth with application as may appeare by comparing this with the fourth verse whither it hath relation for thus they must go i know thy workes and approue of them and yet i haue somthing against thee so that his meaning is i know thy workes that is all thy wayes and dealings in thy life and conuersation are manifest vnto me and i do generally approue of them here first in this testimonie of his knowledge christ ministreth a remedie against secret sinnes and offences the theefe the murtherer and adulterer wait for the night wherein to attempt their shamefull practises the tradesman in secret falsifyeth his weights and mingleth his wares among most man fraud oppression and iniustice do abound and all because they thinke that if man see not all is well as dauid saith the wicked man saith god shall not see he will not regard but if man could thinke and bee persuaded of this that christ seeth and knoweth all their wayes it would cause them to make conscience not onely of grosse sinnes but euen of their hidden and secret offences secondly whereas this knowledge is ioyned with approbation it may be demanded how this can stand with the iustice of god to approue of that which is not answerable to the tenour of his law as the best workes of the most righteous man are not beeing stained with some corruption isay answer the gospell which is another part of god wil reuealeth more vnto vs than euer the law could do namely that if a man bee in christ to him there is no condemnation and that god will accept his true desire and endeuour to please him for the deed it selfe corinthian and thus according to the tenour of the gospell christ approueth of their workes in this place though they were not able to abide the igor of his law but a papist will here reason thus if a righteous mans workes bee approued of god then they are no sinnes for god will not approue of any thing that is sinfull and if his workes be no sinnes then he may fulfill the law and so bee iustified by his workes answer that which christ approueth simply hath no sinne in it but here he onely approueth of their workes in part namely so farre foorth as they came from the work of his spirit in them but as they proceed from the will of the worker which is in part corrupt they are not free from the staine of sinne and so he approueth them not againe workes of grace are approued of christ with the pardon of sinne for accepting of the person he remitteth the faults that be in his good workes and so onely approueth his own worke in him and so here we must conceiue of his approbation of their workes to wit as proceeding from his spirit and hauing the faults thereof remitted in his owne merit the speciall commendation of this church is for particular actions the first whereof is diligent labour which is an excellent worke especally in a minister of god word to be painefull in his particular calling for the faithfull instruction and godly regiment of his particular charge hence paule saith tim he that laboureth in the word and doctrine is principally worthy double honor and herein paul matcheth yes preferreth himselfe before other apostles that hee laboured more abundantly in the ministery of the gospell than they all corinthian hence we learne that the worke of the ministerie if it be done as it ought is a worke full of great paines and labour contrary to the common opinion of man who thinke that the life of the minister is full of ease and his calling a matter of nothing such as may be done with the turning of the hand but here the iudgement of christ is other wayes who vseth not thus to approue a light or idle worke secondly this commendation of diligence in the minister must admonish all christians that desire to be approoued of christ to giue all diligence to learne and know the will of god that they may do the same and here a common fault is to be reproued many will heare but where is their labour to grow in knowledge amp in grace that is wanting which i the cause of such fruitlesse hearing as is common in the world for earthly things man refuse no paines but god heauenly knowledge and graces are not regarded what a shame is this that man should bestow their strength and wit about base and transitorie things and yet neglect the main good which concernes their soules for euer thirdly the ministers diligence in teaching must prouoke conscience of obedience in the hearers that is the end of his worke without this hee spends his strength in vaine and therefore with the apostle they must indeuour in all things to keepe a good conscience before god and all man act the second thing which christ here commends is patien e in bearing the crosse which doth vsually accompanie the gospell of christ and this indeed is praise worthy in the angel of this church for herin he goeth before sundry worthy prophets ieremie was maruellous impatient for the mockings of the people ier and though ionas had beene schooled in the whale belly yet when all things went not according to his mind in the destruction of niniuie he became exceeding discontent herein must all the ministers of the gospell become followers of the angell of this church while they labour in the gospell of god they must possesse their soules with patience and make knowne to all man their meeke and mild spirit yes euerie christian in the profession of religion must learne to practise this duty luke the good ground receiueth the seed and bringeth forth fruit but how with patience neither can wee possibly attaine to eternall life vnlesse we arme our selues with patience to beare the crosse for whosoeuer will liue godly must suffer affliction tim through many tribulations we must enter into heauen act ii againe here obserue how christ ioyneth labour and patience together this he doth for two causes first to let vs see the fruit of sinne which god hath set on the labour of man before the fall the labour of mans calling was practised without all trouble or paines but since mans fall the best callings haue their crosses and vexations which are the punishments of mans transgression socondly to shew vs the malice of sathan against the good progresse of the gospell paul saith to the thessalonians he would haue come to them but sathan did binder him he seeketh the trouble and sorrow of the minister not onely by stirring vp persecution but by keepinh his people from profiting by his ministerie and therefore euerie minister had need to take paines with patience in his calling and as christ ioyneth together labour and patience in the worke of the ministerie so should euery christian after this direction ioyne patience with his paines in the duties of his particular calling whether it be in church commonwealth or familie for looke what is the estate of the minister in his place such shall be the estate of euerie child of god in his this therefore they must doe first seeke to know the duties of their particular calling and therein labour and take paines with all good conscience then considering the crosse doth accompany godly diligence they must labour to ioyne patience with their diligence for their continuance in weldoing euen vnder the crosse and for attaining of this patience they must set before them the promises of god blessing and protection while they so continue not suffering themselues to be dismayed by any affliction and if we shal thus walke in the duties of our particular places painefully and with patience wee shall haue our commendation of christ iesus and his blessed reward which farre surpasseth the praise of man and their rewards but on contrarie if we walke in our callings negligently or else forsake them because of afflictions or be impatient in our labour we shall loose our reward and vndergo the rebuke of christ which is worse than all outward euils that can befall vs the third speciall worke for which christ commendeth this church is seueritie shewed against wicked man in these words and how thou canst not beare them which are euill by euill man hee meaneth such as liued offensiuely and maintained manifest errors and heresies these she could not beare but iudged them as burdens and therefore sought to disburden her selfe of them hence we may gather that it is a necessary thing for euery church to be purged of euill man the church of god in all ages hath put in practise this worke so soone as cain had slaine his brother abel gen god cast him out from his face as appeareth by his owne complaint to wit from that particular place where adam and his familie worshipped god when false prophets and idolaters did arise among the israelits the lord commandeth deu that they should be killed and taken from among them and therefore hee saith to ieremie ier if thou turne and repent i wil bring thee againe and if thou take away the pretious from the vile thou shalt be according to my word corinthian paul commandeth in the name of christ that the incestuous ma be deliuered vnto sathan the church purged of that old leauen and that wicked man put from among them verse besides the euidence of these testimonies some reasons may be added to prooue the necessitie of this separation first god will be worshipped in an holy manner and they that worship god must be purged and sanctified but euill man defile god worship and therefore they ought to be seuered from the church secondly lest the whole church be infected with the contagion of their doctrine or the infection of their life for as leau n sowreth the whole lumpe so will euill man defile the whole church thirdly they are burdens to the church and therefore must be cast out for the church should be eased of euery burden this doctrine is the truth of god amp ought to be practised of god church whereby we may see a common fault in the most cogregations among vs wherin all that will are admitted not onely to the hearing of the word but also vnto the lord table hand ouer head without restraint as though euerie man were a good amp sound christian whereas experience sheweth that many be ignorant many contemners of the gospell many saboath breakers drunkards and blasphemers all which ought to bee barred from the sacraments and in that respect seuered from the church as burdens secondly hence we may gather that christ hath giuen to his church a power iudiciall to suspend euill man from the sacraments and to excommunicate them from the outward fellowship of the church for els he would not haue commended this minister with his church for the execution of this power the reasons alledged to the contrarie are of no force i say they the parable matth alloweth the growing together of tares and wheate till haruest and therefore euill man must bee suffered in the church without seperation answer in that parable christ speaketh not of any particular purging of the church by ecclesiasticall iurisdiction but of the vniuersall purging of his whole church by his holy angels in the end of the world for there the field doth not signifie any particular church but the whole world and the servant are not m n but angels that must gather together all both good and bad in the end of the world to the last iudgement againe they alledge luke compell them in the high wayes to come into the supper here say they all must bee brought in but none must bee excluded the society of the church ans christ speaketh not of compelling man vnto the sacraments but vnto the ministerie of the word wherto man must be caused to subiect themselues which hindereth nothing why the vngodly should not be debarred from the sacraments which are the seale of god mercy in christ ordained onely for such as repent and beleeue qu seeing this separation must be made how farre forth may wee conuerse with those that are openly euill amp offensiue either for life or doctrine ans euill man must be considered diverse waies first as they be members of some commonwealth of some citie or incorporation secondly as they are members of some particular church by tolleration in the first regard it is lawful for vs to conuerse with the i for outward dealings and ciuile affairs as bargaining buying and selling ampc ii we may maintaine outward ciuile peace with them so paule commandeth the romans to haue peace with al man so much as in them lay that is so far as it would stand with faith amp good conscience iii in this ciuile conuersing with the wicked we must perform all duties of outward courtesie and loue vnto them so far forth as it doth not dishonor god or hinder the good of the church and therefore paule commaundeth vs to be tit soft and courteous shewing all meekenesse vnto all man euen to euill man as the reason following sheweth for wee our selues were in time past vnwise disobedient deceiued ampc and then were we euill secondly consider them as dwellers in the church and members by permission and so we may liue with them in it for we may not make a separation from the church because wicked man are permitted therein christ liued among the iewes though their teachers and rulers were both heretickes and hypocrits and yet wee must remember that liuing among them and beholding their wicked conuersation wee must not approoue of their vngodlinesse but bee grieued for the same as righteous lot was for the abhominations of sodome pet further if it fall out by the negligence of the gouernours that euill man bee admitted to the sacraments we must not for their company refuse to communicate for our sauior christ liuing among the jew communicated with them in their sacraments and seruice of the temple though many of them were notorious both for wicked life and false doctrine the reason is for that another mans euill conscience doth not defile our good conscience but wee may keepe a good conscience in that action wherein the wicked is defiled now though wee may thus conuerse with euill man yet these two caueats must be obserued i to haue no priuat company with knowne and open euill persons this paule expressely forbiddeth saying i haue written vnto you that you company not together that is in priuate and familiar manner ii wee must not shew speciall familiarit to euill persons god will not take the wicked by the hand iob and we should be followers of god therefore s john sayth if any man come vnto you and bring not this do trine receiue him not into house neither bid him god speed john which must bee vnderstood of speciall familiaritie for thereby we doe not onely performe outward dutie to the person but also giue countenance to their sinnes which in any case wee must not doe and thus wee see how to conuerse with euill man hereby all those are iustly blamed which fit themselues for the humors and dispositions of al company this ought not to be if any be knowne to be openly wicked either for life or opinions wee must not keepe priuate company with them or affoord them our speciall familiaritie but by withdrawing our selues from them case vs of such burdens our sauiour christ hauing commended this church for her seueritie against the wicked in that she could not endure them doth prooue the same to bee true by two arguments the first whereof is contained in these words and hast examined them ampc to the end of the third verse the second in the sixt verse for the first it is taken from the sharpe and round dealing of this church against euill man and it hath two parts first her discouerie of false apostles and hast examined them which say they are apostles and are not and hast found them liers secondly her opposing her selfe against them being discouered in the third verse thou hast suffered and hast patience ampc in their discouerie of these false apostles note two speciall points first that god hath giuen to particular churches the spirit of wisedome that is the spirit of discerning this appeareth by sundry testimonies of scripture corinthian the spirituall man that is bee which is endued with god holy spirit discerneth all things and paule corinthian assumeth that the faithfull corinthians did discerne the lord bodie that is see and put a great difference betweene the bread and wine in that sacrament and other common bread amp wine which none that want the spirit of god can doe againe he biddeth them corinthian proue themselues whether they be in the faith or not to giue vs to vnderstand that they had a gift of discerning whereby they did know their owne estate whether they were vnder the curse or vnder grace and s john biddeth the church to ioh trie the spirits that is those doctrines which man pretending the gifts of the spirit did teach and in this place this churches discouering of false apostles declareth plainely that shee hath a gift to discerne who bee sent of god to teach his church and who not and hence the godly learned in the church are sayd to haue their sences exercised to discerne both good and euill heb and in this regard the churches of god differ from all other company of man for vnlesse man be of god church they want this gift of discerning spirituall things that differ as true apostles and false good and bad truth and falshood ampc hence we may gather that the church of god hath a gift to discerne which is a true church and which is not for the church can discerne whether a man bee a true apostle or not and by the same gift it may discerne the state of any particular church whence also it followeth that wee may easily see whether the church of england bee a true church or not it pleaseth some to call it into question as it now standeth and they auouch that it is no church of god that there are no true ministers no true preaching or right administration of the sacraments in it and that these things with vs are illusions of sathan and our church his synagogue but that ours is a true church of god is thus prooued the churches of germany fraunce scotland and italie that haue receiued the gospell are the churches of god and they haue the gift of discerning which is a true church of god and which is not now they giue the right hands of fellowship vnto vs and reuerence our church as the church of god to whose testimonie we must rather cleaue than to the opinion of a few priuate man and so resolue our selues that wee are the true church of god secondly hence we may gather that the church of god hath a gift to discerne scripture from that which is no scripture the papists say the church indeed hath this gift but it is by counsell and commission fro the church of rome which is a meere forgerie for the church of ephesus which could discerne of false apostles could no doubt by the same gift discerne of the booke of god and that without counsell from the church of rome for at this time when john writ it was a more famous church than the church of rome and therefore went not thither for counsell ii point in what things this discerning of false apostles doth consist it is a iudiciall action of the church consisting in two things here noted first in examination of false doctrine and false teachers secondly in condemnation afterward the examination of them is set downe in these words and hast examined them that say they are apostles and are not their condemning or sentence giuing in the words following and hast found them liers for the first examination is a gift of god to his church and was here vsed for the triall of false apostles que how may any church trie a false teacher answer this is a point of large discourse but the heads of true examination are these first that church or that man that would rightly examine a false teacher must prepare himselfe thereunto after this manner he must looke that he haue a meeke spirit and an humble heart for god reuealeth his will not to the proud but to the meeke and lowly and as isay sayth to them that are of a contrite spirit isay and in this humbling of himselfe a man must renounce his owne naturall wit and reason and become nothing in himselfe but euen a foole in respect of his owne conceit also he must vnfainedly pray to god that hee would reueale vnto him his truth aske sayth christ and it shall be giuen you euen luke the holy ghost vnto them that desire of the father and s iames sayth iames if any man lack wisdome let him aske of god which giueth to all man liberally secondly after preparation hee must labour to know throughly what the false teachers are and what be thei opinions with the grounds and foundations thereof wherein they agree and wherein they differ from the truth of god maintained by the church for it is a foule ouersight to misconceiue the state of the aduersaries question by propounding it otherwise than they hold as it falleth out with many in the handling of controuersies thirdly due proofe must bee made whether the aduersaries doctrine bee of man or of god this is god commandement john proue the spirits whether they be of god or not and for triall hereof we must haue recourse vnto the word of god it must be iudge in this cause isa verse to the law and to the testimonies if they speake not according to this word it is because there is no light in them john search the scriptures for in them yee looke to haue eternall life and they are they which testifie of mee who is so fit to iudge in the matters of god as god himselfe and so hee doth in his written word of all doctrine and opinions in religion the scriptures shew whether the doctrine examined be directly gathered thence and by iust consequent or not fourthly serious consideration must bee had of the faith and liues of the teachers examined for a false teacher by god iust iudgement is vsually a wicked liuer and therefore christ sayth mat yee shall know them by their fruits if they bee throughly examined such they will appeare howsoeuer for a time they may bleare the eyes of man as the hystories of the church in many famous heretickes doe plainely declare the second braunch of this discouerie is sentence giuing in these wordes and hast found them liers the church here giueth out a sharpe and seuere sentence against them shee calleth them false apostles and liers and yet she sinneth not for christ commendeth her for it though to raile or taunt cannot beseem any yet magistrats and ministers in their places may giue ou seuere speeches against offendors in token of detestation to their sinnes and not offend thus john called the scribes and pharisees a generation of vipers matth and our sauiour christ called herod a foxe luke and paule called the galathians fooles gal and in this place the church calleth these false teachers lyers which is very much for therein shee accuseth them of three things first of teaching that which was false indeed secondly that they know it to be false and so sinned of knowledge thirdly that they did it of malice with intent to blind the eyes of the church and to deceiue the people in this discouerie wee may obserue the iust accomplishment of paules prophecie acts namely that there should rise vp among the ephesians grieuous wolues and man speaking peruerse things and such were these false apostles who after examination were found liers againe seeing in the dayes of this apostle john man durst presume to claim apostolicke authoritie and call themselues apostles when they were not no maruell if the pope of rome sixe hundred yeares after did challenge to himselfe to be peters successour and to haue apostolicke authoritie and that they dare now auouch some bookes to bee scripture which are not as also bring in their traditions amp vnwritten verities to bee receiued and obeyed equally with god word here our sauiour christ declareth how this minister and church of ephesus opposed themselues against false teachers after their discouerie the manner we shall see in handling the points particularly as they lie in order thou hast suffered or thou hast borne a burden for the word signifieth to be pressed downe vnder a great burden this burden was the troubles which false apostles brought vpon them after they were discouered partly by open affliction and persecution partly by the spreading of their hereticall and schismaticall doctrine these false teachers were ebion cerinthus marcion and such like who in the dayes of john troubled this church as hystories do shew here wee may obserue that it is god will that the best churches should be troubled by wicked man and hereticall teachers who both by false doctrine and persecution become grieuous burdens this the lord permits for weighty causes i that true beleeuers may bee excited more constantly to embrace the syncere doctrine of the gospell and therefore iude iud most worthily exhorts the christians in his time to fight for the common faith ii that professors may be tried whether they soundly hold the doctrine of the gospell or not corinthian it is ette sayth paule that there should bee heresies in the church that they which are sound in the faith and approoued may ee knowne iii that god may execute his iudgements vpon wicked man and hypocrites that haue not loued his truth reuealed vnto them thess god gaue them vp to strange illusions to beleeue lies because they haue not loued his truth for many know the word that loue it not this must teach vs to take heed of a common scandale in the world which is to be offended at religion because there be in the church schismes and heresies which come not from the gospell but from the malice of sathan who soweth his tares among the lord wheate wee must consider that it is the will of god there should be such euils in his church and therefore should labour to bee so farre from offence that hereby wee bee rather prouoked with more cheerefulnesse and courage to loue and embrace religion and hast patience and for my name hast suffered ampc here is set downe the dealing of this church against these false apostles in all their persecutions but first note the coherence of this vertue with the former thou hast suffered trouble and hast had patience quest how can these stand together it is against mans nature in trouble to be patient for troubles and afflictions make man discontent and to fret against god and man answer they stand not by nature but by grace rom verse tribulation bringeth forth patience namely to all those that haue receiued to beleeue in christ for to them god giueth the spirit of meekenesse in their troubles shedding his loue into their hearts whereby they are enabled to suffer any thing for his name euen with ioy and hast patience this is the first means whereby this church opposed her selfe against the false apostles they troubled her two wayes by persecution and by false doctrine now by patience this church opposeth her selfe against their persecutions and indeed that is the most excellent meanes for any man or any church to oppose theselues against their enemy and to vanquish them for hereby they shall stop their mouths and if it bee possible win them to their faith and religion in this their practise wee haue an example for our direction how to oppose our selues against wicked man with whom we liue or any enemie that shall trouble vs either by oppression or hereticall doctrines we must not render taunt for taunt and abuse for abuse but labour for patience not in bearing with their sinnes that may not bee but in a meeke enduring of their iniuries and wrongs whereby they trouble vs thus shall we stoppe their mouths and soonest ouercome them and for my names sake hast laboured here christ setteth downe the second meanes whereby this church opposeth her selfe against the spreading of false doctrine by these false apostles which was the second way wherby they became a burden vnto her the meaning of the words is this that they had taken much paines to maintaine the glory of god and the true doctrine of christ iesus labouring therein as much as the false apostles did to broach their damnable heresies here wee are taught a second duty how we are to oppose our selues against all hereticall and scismaticall teachers namely as they labour to publish their false doctrine so must wee endeuor to maintaine the glorie of god and his true religion hereunto a twofold labour is required partly of the minister and partly of the people the labour of the minister stands in these things principally i he must endeuour by reading and studie to furnish himselfe with the true knowledge of the foundation and substance of the gospel amp true religion that hee may be able soundly and plainly to teach the same for this cause s john is commanded to eat the little booke re which was as it were by studie and meditation to haue the same digested and setled in his heart hence malachie saith mal the priests lippes should preserue wisedome and thither should the people come for instruction and euerie scribe taught of god must haue store in the treasury of his har like a good housholder matth he must deliuer the whole will and counsell of god concerning saluation truly and distinctly vnto his people as it is propounded in the booke of the prophets and apostles this paul commendeth by his owne example act testifying vnto this church that he had taught them all the will of god and kept back nothing which he was commanded to deliuer vnto them iii hee must labour to discerne and bee able to discouer false teachers vnto the people that hee may not onely know them himselfe but also cause the church to take notice of them tit paul requireth that the teacher in the church be able to conuince the gainsaiers to his truth in this discouerie he must do two things first detect their hereticall doctrins secondly their wicked maners thus dealt our sauiour christ in his owne person liuing in the church of the iewes with the scribes and pharises he did detect vnto the people their false interpretations of the law mat to the end and also their wicked liues and damn ble hypocrisie mat ampc to the end and saint paul in all his epistles laboureth to discouer the wicked liues and to confute the hereticall opinions of the false apostles iv hee must endeuour that the doctrine of the gospell thus published may edifie this is the end of all teaching as paule sheweth corinthian throughout the whole chapter now it doth edifie when it is so applied to the hearers that thereby they are wonne to christ suffering themselues to be reformed by it in heart and life amp so made fit for the kingdome of god v he must be careful in his own person to become a patterne of the doctrine of the gospell which hee teacheth that so the people may haue a double light to follow this is a notable meanes in the minister to make man loue the gospell and the neglect hereof causeth many to contemne and despise the same vi lastly he must bee diligent in praying for his owne and other particular churches of god that they may know beleeue and obey the same doctrine which is taught them out of god word thus did paul as wee may see in his particular epistles pray for euery church that by the blessing of the spirit they might embrace and obey the gospell of christ philipp column the people also for the name of christ and his religion must vndergo a threefold labour i euery one must see that himselfe know and beleeue the true and sincere doctrine of the gospell this christ inioyneth to all in this commandement repent and beleeue which none can do vnlesse they first know and vnderstand the doctrine thereof and therfore euery one must do as mary did for which christ so commends her namely lay aside matters of less moment amp giue our selues to heare and learne the doctrine of christ luke ii euery one must vse all good meanes that knowledge of religion which himselfe hath receiued bee conueyed to others and indeed if we truly beleeue we cannot containe our selues but must needs teach others for as christ saith he ioh that drinketh of the water of life out of his belly shall flow river of water of life streaming out for the good of others que how should priuat man conuey their knowledge vnto others answer i all maisters and gouernours of families are bound in conscience to teach those that are vnder them the maine points and grounds of true religion his place requireth gifts and god lookes for increase for euery christian family should be a little church as it is sayd of the house of aquila and priscilla corinthian ii euerie man in his place must labour to conuey that knowledge he hath vnto his neighbour yes to his enemy the iewes mat would compasse sea and land to make a man a pros lite and idolaters at this day will trauell farre and neere to make a man of their profession much more therefore must all true christians labour to conuey their knowledge to others so to winne them vnto christ iii euerie man is to edifie those that bee members of the same church in these three things faith hope and loue as iude notably exhorteth in the end of his epistle edifie one another in your most holie faith verse haue compassion of some in putting difference and others saue with feare in pulling them out of the fire ver iv euery priuat man must professe and defend the true religion of christ against all the enemy thereof pet be readie alwayes to giue an answer to euery man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you and this confession must be not onely in word but in deed for by a blamelesse and holy conuersation euerie christian holdeth foorth the word of life philipp seeing the maintenance of true religion is so excellent a worke wee must be admonished euery one in our place to take paines in all the duties that belong vnto vs that by vs christ religion may be furthered for god church is not called the piller of truth onely because the minister thereof maintaineth god truth but also because euery member of the church is as a piller in his place to maintaine and professe the true doctrine of christ for his glory besides this is a duty of the first table and therefore we must haue more speciall care for the performance thereof and thus wee see the two meanes whereby the church of ephesus opposed her selfe against false teachers and hast not fainted here christ setteth downe in what manner this church laboured to maintaine his true religion and thereby his honor and glory namely by constancie and perseuerance in labour this is an excellent vertue and a notable example for vs to follow for we through god goodnesse haue the true religion of christ among vs and for many yeares sundrie among vs haue maintained the same against all enemy though not without some trouble and danger now this which hath beene done is nothing vnlesse we hold on our good course constantly and labour vnto death in the maintenance thereof this exhortation is the more necessary because we know not how long we shal enioy the gospel with peace for vsually after long peace god trieth his by persecution neither know we by what meanes of triall god will exercise vs therefore as we now professe the gospell so let vs continue constant therein and not turne with time or state for then wee loose our comendation at christs hands and thus much of the commendation of this church for her vertues these words containe the second part of the proposition of this epistle to wit a sharpe and seuere reproofe of this church for decay in grace as will appeare in the opening of the words neuerthelesse i haue somewhat against thee here christ speaketh as a iudge vnto this church and to the minister thereof and layeth this action vnto their charge that they had left their first loue that is that loue which they bare to god and his religion and to their brother at that time whe they were first called vnto the profession of the gospell this loue they are sayd to haue left not as though they had quite lost it but onely because they suffered it to decay and to waxe cold in good workes but some will say they are before commended for their zeale and labour for god glory and for their seueritie against false teachers how then had they left their first loue answer at this time when christ doth thus reproue them their loue was commendable but yet it was nothing in regard of that which they had at their first conuersion if christ haue something against this church for leauing her first loue then no doubt he hath something against the church of england and against vs at this day howsoeuer wee may persuade our selues that we be high in his fauour yet we are in the like or a worse estate than this church now was for a great part of the body of our church hath left off their first loue and the greatest part hath no loue at all that many haue left their first loue is too too euident for such as in queene maries time were content to suffer much for the gospell as the history of our church do shew after they inioyed a little quietnesse became meere worldlings as their liues haue testified afterward and in such congregations where the word hath long bin preached this is too apparant that man who for the space of twentie of ten or seuen yeares haue shewed feruent loue to christ and his gospell and to their brother do now fall away and shew none at all he that hath but halfe an eye may see many for a yeare or two very forward and zealous in religion who soone after suffer pleasures profit or preferments to drawe them quite away some i confesse through the mercie of god are free from this decay but there is yet a more grieuous fault among vs for the greatest part of our people haue no loue at all these are the dayes whereof christ sayd matth loue should waxe cold and whereof paul sayd man should be ti louers of themselues for take the most congregations where the gospell hath bene long preached yet you shall find that the hearers are neither bettered for knowledge nor for obedience but remaine still as ignorant and profane as euer they were this argueth that they haue no loue of god in their hearts though they haue a formall profession of his name in their mouth for where the loue of god is there most needs bee increase in knowledge in grace and in obedience againe see how man generally walke in their callings and therin behold a meere defect of loue all the paines they take is for their priuat gaine and pleasure no regard is had of god glory of the maintenance of true religio and of the good of their brother herein their owne consciences shall be the witnesses so that generally this may be said we haue no loue at all what an action then shall we thinke hath christ against vs it must needs bee grieuous and so our case fearefull and dangerous if an earthly prince and potentat had an action against vs and his case were good it would make vs looke about vs yes to tremble and quake and to be at our wits end behold not a worldly prince but the king of heauen and earth hath a matter against vs iust and grieuo oh how should this moue vs to search our selues to trie our estate and to humble our selues vpon the knees of our heart before his maiestie we may not imagine that this charge of christ doth not concerne vs the conclusion of this epistle shewes it belongs to all that haue eares to heare and therefore we should labour to preuent god iudgement by iudging our selues for our decay and want of loue againe this rebuke of christ for decay of loue should teach vs to labour for increase in loue to god and to our brother adding grace to grace in our harts as we adde day vnto day in our liues that so our loue may obound read thes where paule vrgeth this dutie at large he confesseth they did loue one another and yet beseecheth them to increase therein philipp in pauls person we haue a worthie president which we must follow if wee thinke to come whither he is gone before though hee had gone farre in the loue of god yet he laboured to perfection and therefore considered not that which was past as resting in it but rather how farre hee was too short that so he might vse meanes to increase in loue and in all other good graces till hee come to perfection a christian mans life is a way that leadeth to heauen wherein we once setting foot must uer go forward and not stand still or turne backe lest we neuer come there the state of a christian is like vnto a child which still groweth till it come to a perfect strength and so must euerie child of god labour to grow in the graces of god till they bee perfect man in christ for if they stand still christ hath something against them the rhemists in their annotations abuse this place to proue that a man may quite fall away from grace therefore to cleare this text and to confirme our hearts in the truth of god word thi question must be scanned whether a man may quite fall away from grace answer grace in scripture is taken two wayes first for that fauour of god whereby hee accepteth of some for his children in christ this is the first grace and the fountaine of all other and taking grace in this sense i say that the signes of grace and the sense thereof in the heart may be lost but the f our of god it selfe cannot bee lost of them that truly beleeue when an earthly father is displeased with his child for some notorious crime hee will turne the signes of his fauour into signes of displeasure and shew the same partly by words and partly by stripes and yet he still continueth his father and holdeth him for his son without any purpose to disinherit him euen so god dealeth with his children for their sins and corruptions he will turne away his louing countenance from them and change the signes of his fauour into anger and displeasure when as yet the good purpose of their adoption is not altered but remaineth firme for euer and god is still their father though an angrie father through the prouocation of their sinnes secondly grace in scripture is taken for the gifts of grace which are bestowed on them that beleeue in christ these gifts of grace be of two sorts some more principall of absolute necessitie vnto saluation without which none can bee saued as faith and also hope and loue which proceed from faith there be others also lesse principall which be very profitable and requisit yet not absolutly needfull vnto saluation as the feeling of god fauor alacritie in prayer amp sense of ioy and comfort in the holy ghost these lesse principal graces may quite be lost the principall graces also may be decayed lessened and couered in regard of operation euen in god children but quite extinguished they cannot be for god vpholdeth them by perseuerance where faith hope amp loue are once truly wrought by god spirit they are neuer wholly or finally taken away but onely in part and in sense and feeling for a time this answer is agreeable to this text for the church of ephesus is here blamed not for quite loosing her loue but because she had left her first loue suffering it to decay and waxelesse than it was at their first conuersion and because this doctrine is oppugned earnestly not onely by the church of rome but also by some churches and schooles of the protestant i will first shew the truth hereof out of god word and then scan the cheefe reasons that are brought against it that grace cannot bee wholly and finally lost these reasons proue i matth the promise is made to peter and in him to all the faithfull that vpon that faith which he professed christ would build his temple and the gates of hell should not preuaile against it which last words must be marked for they intimate that the diuell with his adherents would shew much force and violence against the faith of the elect but yet they should neuer get the victory or ouercome it wholly ii matth christ foretelling that false prophets should come sayth they should seduce if it were possible the very elect where he taketh this for graunted that the elect albeit they may bee assaulted greeuously yet they can neuer be wholly or finally drawne away from their faith iii john my sheepe heare my voyce sayth christ and i know them and they follow me and i giue vnto them eternall life and they shall neuer perish to this they answer it is true they shall neuer perish so long as they remaine the sheepe of christ but that cauill is cut off in the next wordes neither shall any plucke them out of my hands my father which gaue them me is greater than all and none is able to plucke them out of my fathers hands and therefore neither the deuill nor the world nor the flesh can by any temptation draw the sheep of christ from their faith and make them to be no sheepe iv reason john hee that beleeueth in christ hath eternall life they say hee hath it in hope and no otherwise i answere if they haue it in hope they shall neuer perish rom for hope maketh not ashamed v reason rom whom hee predestinat them also he called and whom hee called them also be iustified and whom hee iustified them also be glorified those which are elected called and iustified by faith must needs be glorified and therefore cannot fall away finally for such shall neuer be glorified and in the end of the chapter verse hee addeth that neither death nor life angels principality nor powers nor any thing els can separate vs viz the faithfull from the loue of god which is in christ iesus our lord but if the faithfull might fall away finally then they might be seuered from the loue of god vi reason rom the gifts of god calling that is the peculiar gifts that pertaine to saluation are without repentance they say it is true god indeed neuer repenteth him of his gifts but yet a man may perish and fall away because he may refuse and reiect god grace giuen vnto him this answere is friuolous maintaining this absurditie that the powerfull will of god should be broght vnder the silly will of the creature if man could repell god grace giuen vnto him then should mans will take place and god will bee made frustrate and void vii reason john whosoeuer is borne of god sinneth not because his seede remaineth in him neither can bee sinne because he is borne of god how is that true for chap hee that sayth he hath not sinned maketh god a lyar and his word is not in him answer the place must bee vnderstood thus he that is borne of god sinneth not that is with full consent and with all his hart sinne doth not raigne in him for the regenerate man consisteth of two parts flesh and spirit he sinneth not as hee is spirit that is regenerate but as hee is flesh and sinfull his will sinneth not as it is spirituall but as it is carnall the papists say indeed he sinneth not so long as he continueth to be borne of god but this shift is cut off by the wordes of the text neither can be sinne because the seede of grace euen the word of god abideth in him this place plainely proueth euen in the iudgement of the papists that the child of god cannot wholly or finally fall from grace they say it is a hard place and indeed they cannot answere to it viii reason if a man may finally fall from grace then may hee bee wholly cut off from christ for grace is neuer wholly lost till a man bee quite cut off from christ but it cannot bee that a member of christ can be quite cut off for then it should follow that one and the same man must bee often ioyned to christ namely so often as hee falleth by sinne if he would be saued whereupon this would also follow that one and the same man must be often baptized for baptisme is the sacrament of incision the meanes of admission into the church and the seale of our vnion with christ but rebaptization may not bee admitted the church of god denieth it vpon this ground because a man is onely once borne of god ix reason christ teacheth vs to pray thus leade vs not into temptation that is suffer not sathan and sinne wholly to preuaile against vs and finally to vanquish vs this petition being taught by christ must needes be lawful and according to god will and therefore hereunto as to euery lawful petition belong these two things first god commaund to make it secondly his promise to assure vs it shall bee graunted whereby this is euident that there is in god word a promise assuring euery child of god that hee shall neuer wholly be conquered of the deuill and therefore he can neuer wholly or finally fall from grace for if hee might then were he wholly ouercome in temptation the contrarie arguments be of three sorts places of scripture examples and reasons for the first exod when the israelits had sinned that great sinne of idolatry moses prayeth god to forgiue them if not sayth he blot mee out of thy booke hence they gather that a child of god may bee blotted out of god booke of life and so finally perish answer that place must be vnderstood with this condition if is be possible as in the like prayer it is expressed by christ father if it be possible let this cup passe from me this condition must needs be added for els wee must say that moses prayed for that which he knew was impossible namely that one priuate man should suffer eternall punishments for the sinnes of others though in temporall punishments such a thing may be yet in eternall it is impossible againe moses in this prayer doth principally shew his exceeding affection and zeale for god glorie and for the safetie of his brother both which hee preferred before his owne life as if hee should say lord pardon them and rather than thy name should loose glorie blot me out of thy booke the like affection was in paule when hee sayd rom he could wish himselfe to be separate from christ for the loue of his brother the iewes they further vrge the lord answere to moyses verse whosoeuer hath sinned against mee i will put him out of my booke but as the lord therein answereth to moses prayer so must it bee vnderstood with the like exception ii obiect ezek if the righteous man turne away from his righteousnesse and commit iniquitie and doe according to all the abhominations that the wicked man doth shall hee liue all his righteousnesse that hee hath done shall not be mentioned but hee shall die in his sinne here say they it is plaine that a man may fall from grace answer righteousnesse is twofold of the outward action and of the person so paule distinguisheth when he desireth to be sound phi p not in his owne righteousnesse which is of the law that is such as was in him while hee was a pharisee but in the righteousnesse of christ the righteousnesse of the action is when a man for outward actions keeps the law of god the righteousnesse of the person is that whereby a man is accepted righteous before god and answerable hereunto there be two kinds of righteous man one that is outwardly righteous before man thogh not indeed the other that is truly righteous before god now of the former of these two must that place be vnderstood for the lord there pleadeth with such as did esteeme and auow themselues to be righteous saying their fathers had eaten soure grapes that is had sinned and they were punished for their fathers offences though they were righteous and the holy ghost speaking according to their own conceit and opinion of themselues calleth them righteous and of such it is true they may turn from their righteousnesse iii obiect luke some beleeue for a time and in time of temptation goe away answer there be three kinds of faith historicall temporarie and sauing faith in histo icall faith is knowledge of the word of god with assent vnto it in temporary faith are three things knowledge of the word assent and approbation also with some ioy in sauing faith there are foure things knowledge assent approbation and apprehension that is an applying of the promises of god vnto a mans selfe whence proceedeth some ioy and answerably there are three kinds of beleeuers i such as know the word of god but yet haue no loue thereof ii such as know it assent vnto it and reioyce in it also for a time the third are such as apprehend the promises and apply them to themselues now the two first kinds of faith may bee left and the two first kinds of beleeuers may fall away whereof saint luke speaketh but hence it followeth not that sauing faith may be lost for he that is endued therewith can neuer fall away but faith say they is onely one ephesian there is but one faith one god one hope and one baptisme answer by one faith is there meant one religion and doctrine of saluation as elsewhere is vsuall by the name of faith tim their second kind of arguments are examples which are chiefely two one of adam the other of dauid for adam they say he was created righteous and yet hee fell wholly from grace and therefore any beleeuer now may much more fall away who haue farre lesse grace than he had answer this argument is not good for though adam had a greater measure of grace than we now haue yet our grace hath a greater priuiledge than his had his grace came by creation ours is by redemption and regeneration adam had the first grace to bee able to obey but he wanted the second to be sure to perseuere because god would permit his fall to make a way both to manifest his iustice and mercie in our redemption by christ but the child of god after his conuersion wherein hee hath the first grace to repent and beleeue hath also an infallible promise that he shall receiue the second grace to abide in that faith and therefore paule sayth i philip am persuaded that hee which hath begun this good worke in you will performe it vntill the day of the lord iesus christ and againe thes the lord is faithfull who will stablish you and keepe you from euill secondly dauid say they by his two grieuous sinnes fell wholly from grace answer he fell indeed grieuously but not wholly for after his fall hee contemned not god word he hated not god nor despaired of mercie which hee must haue done if he had fallen wholly and therefore he had remorse for his sinne so soone as the prophet nathan come vnto him but say they hee prayeth god to create a new heart in him therefore hee had then no grace for creation is a making of that which hath no being answer dauid then speeketh not as he was before god but as hee was in his owne sence and feeling for by his sinnes god graces were sore decayed but say they hee repented not for the space of one whole yeare now where there is no repentance there is no faith and consequently no grace nor pardon answer in repentance there be two things the gift of repentance and the act and practise thereof the gift of repentance was in the heart of dauid when he yet lay in his sinnes but the act thereof lay hid and he wanted the renewing thereof all that time againe dauid had the pardon of his sinnes past though hee had not the pardon of those two sinnes till hee repented of them neither was his repentance lost but decayed onely hee wanted not the power of it simply but the practise of it onely in that act their third kind of arguments are drawne from equitie and reason i hee that is a member of an harlot and of the deuill ceaseth wholly to bee a member of christ but a child of god truly beleeuing may become the member of an harlot and of sathan as dauid did answer there be three kinds of members dead decaied and liuing members a dead member is that which is onely in shew a member as a legge of wood or of brasse in a mans bodie a decayed member is a true member though weak as is a legge or arme that is taken with a palsie or sore wounded but a liuely member is that which doth moue and do all it functions perfectly so in the church there be some members dead and onely in shew others feeble and weake that by reason of some grieuous sinnes are not able to doe their duties and there bee liuely members which serue god with an vpright and perfect heart now though a member of an harlot cannot be a liuely member of christ because by his sinnes hee weakeneth and woundeth the graces of god for euery adulterer and fornicator doth as much as in him lieth cut himselfe off from christ yet hee may bee a decayed member of christ and this may the rather stand because a man is made the member of christ one way namely spiritually and the member of an harlot another way namely bodily ii reason if a man cannot fall from grace then preaching prayer the sacraments and all means of perseuerance are needlesse answer nothing lesse for they haue all their good and necessarie vse vnto them which haue grace euen to make them constant in grace for where the scripture teacheth the certaintie of saluation it implieth the vse of the meanes of perseuerance paul in his iourney to rome was certaine they should come all safe to land act by the promise of god yet when the marines would haue gone out of the ship hee telleth the captaine vnlesse verse these stay in we cannot be saued because they were the meanes to bring them to land so when isay had told ezekias from the lord that he should liue fifteene yeares longer he was thereby assured of recouerie and yet hee vsed isa a bunch of figges as a meanes thereof as also food and rayment to preserue his life afterward iii reason this doctrine of certaine perseuerance maintaineth man in securitie answer securitie is twofold carnall and spirituall carnall when a man regardeth not at all the means of his saluation but giueth himselfe wholly to the profit and pleasures of this world spirituall when a man relieth on god for his saluation by beleeuing his promises and this securitie it maintaineth but not the carnall securitie for it teacheth the vse of the meanes of perseuerance as prayer hearing and reading of the word and receiuing the sacraments and thus i conclude this question that the true child of god who truly beleeueth when he sinneth doth neither wholly nor finally fall away neither can doe lastly if this were true of this famous church of ephesus which was founded and preserued by the apostles that shee suffered her first loue to decay then how can it bee otherwise with vs but that wee should suffer our first loue as well towards god as man to lessen and diminish and that this is so our consciences will tell vs if wee looke to that loue and zeale we had at our first calling and though wee haue not felt this decay yet we must know wee bee in danger of it continually and therefore we must take heed that we suffer not our good affections in religion to diminish water that hath beene once hot will afterward be most cold and freese the hardest euen so when our hearts haue beene once heated with the fire of the lord altar as true loue and other graces of the spirit if we suffer them to decay we shall become more frozen in iniquitie than any others the hawke while shee is quicke to take her prey is set vpon the hand of kings and nobles but if shee wax weake and die she is cast off to the dunghill euen so while we are hote and cheerefull in loue towards god and his church wee are carried as it were on god owne hand but if wee faint and decay in loue we shall be cast lower than if wee had neuer beene so exalted this loue of god in vs is like a little flame of fire for the maintaining whereof wee must doe three things first take heed of all manner of sinne which quencheth loue and other graces of the spirit as water quencheth fire in the old testament the priests kept fire burning vpon the altar day and night to be alwayes readie to sacrifice vnto the lord and so must we keep the flame of loue amp other graces continually burning in our hearts that thence we may offer vp acceptable sacrifices of praise and thanksgiuing vnto the lord secondly we must stir vp the gifts of grace that are in vs as paule sayth to timothie tim vsing a comparison from the fire which burneth more bright and cleare when it is stirred vp lastly wee must exercise our selues in the duties of pietie as faith repentance loue and such like amp so shall they not decay and thus much for the sinne of this church our sauiour christ the faithfull physition of our soules hauing sharpely rebuked this church doth here prescribe vnto them a soueraigne remedie against their sinne of decay in loue fro whence we may learne that the law whereby sin is reproued is to be taught but yet with this qualification that withall the doctrine of the gospell be ioyned thereunto that the sinnes which are ripped vp by the law may be cured by the gospel this is christs manner of preaching in this place whose practise is a most worthie platforme for all his ministers for we haue no warrant at this day to preach the law barely which onely maketh the wound without the gospell which alone sheweth the remedie this remedie here prescribed is of speciall vse and worthie our consideration generally by it we haue direction to answer to two necessarie questions of practise which often fall out in the life of man first a man is effectually called to professe the gospell and yet after his conuersion either through the corruption of his nature or by the temptation of the diuell and the world falleth into sinne againe what must this man do for his recouerie ans he must remember whence he is fallen and repent of those his sinnes and do his first workes the second question is this a man that hath all his life long liued in ignorance and sin is now touched in conscience for his loose life how shall this man escape the wrath of god amp become reconciled vnto him ans he must first remember whence hee is fallen by adams sinne and by his owne transgressions secondly hee must repent of his sinnes thirdly endeuor to do the first workes whereto he is bound by the law of creation amp so shal he escape the wrath of god and be receiued into his loue and fauour in particular this remedie hath three parts the first remember whence thou article fallen the second and repent the third and do thy first workes the words following or else i will come against thee ampc are a reason of this remedie to persuade them to do the duties prescribed for the first remember whence thou article fallen the words beare this sence examine thy selfe throughly amp see in thy selfe the decay of thy former loue and then ponder the same in thy heart seriously and throughly here christ inioyneth to this church two duties i examination whereby shee must descend into her owne heart and search out her owne wants especially the want of her loue to god to his word and to her brother ii consideration whereby she must often thinke of these her wants and lay the same to her heart vnfainedly this course which christ taketh with this church teacheth vs first that it is a dangerous thing for any person in god church not to bee acquainted throughly with his owne estate that so hee may search out his owne wants and deeply consider of the same for this very thing ieremie blamed the people in his time that no man sayd with himselfe ier what haue i done and christ layeth this sinne to the charge of the people of the old world that they were ignorant of their estate they knew nothing till the floud came and oke them all away and this is the common sin of this age no man almost doth examine himselfe amp consider in his hart his owne estate by reason of his sinnes and wants nay man are growne to this that they count it a meanes to breed melancholie and therefore do lie the practise of this dutie and so nuzzell themselues in their fearefull securitie secondly here wee learne that it is a speciall dutie for them that liue in god church to be throughly acquainted with their owne estate to examine and search out their owne sinnes and often to consider seriously of their particular wants zephanie preaching the doctrine of repentance vnto the people beginneth thus search ye search your selues oh nation not worthie to be beloued where the word translated search signifieth such a search as a man would make for some small thing in a great heape of chaffe this is the lord counsell hag consider your owne wayes in your hearts and it must be our practise if we would be saued this duty is the beginning and ground of true repentance and therefore christ here giueth it the first place for no man can truly repent before hee bee acquainted with his owne infirmities and with his owne fearefull and damnable estate by reason of his sinnes and therefore dauid saith psalm i first considered my wayes and then i turned my feete into thy testimonies the cause why so few in the world doe truly repent is want of consideration from whence they are fallen and what bee their sinnes and the dreadful iudgements thereby deserued for till the mind doe truly conceiue her owne miserie the hart can neuer rightly hunger after mercie sinne must bee our greatest woe before christ become our chiefest ioy the second part of this remedie is repentance i selfe for after a man is well acquainted with his wants and hath throughly considered of his owne misery then he commeth to repent in the handling hereof fiue points are to be obserued i what repentanceis ii how it is to be practised iii who commandeth it iv to whom it is commaunded v for what they must repent for the first repentance properly is in the mind as the word in this place doth import for it signifieth thus much after some follie or ouerslip to be better aduised repentance then in the mind is a change from evil to good or a turning from sinne vnto god act repent and turne to god which latter words expound the former amp plainly shew what repentance is and this change in the mind standeth in this resolution whereby a man by god grace purposeth to leaue all his former sinnes and to cleaue vnto god in holy obedience vnto all his commandements and when this resolution is in the mind therwithall followeth a turning of the whole man in will in affections and in all the actions of his life this appeareth by that description of the practise of repentance which paul reduceth to seuen heads viz care clearing of themselues indignation feare great desire zeale and reuenge corinthian wherof some are renewed affections and some reformed actions hereby appeareth that their description of repentance is not so fit amp proper which say it standeth in these three contrition faith and new obedience for contrition is not a part of repentance but a cause thereof and so is faith as christ teacheth in his well knowne sermon mat repent and beleeue the gospel where they are plainly distinct and indeed a man must first beleeue in christ and then followeth repentance and for new obedience it is not a part of repentance but a fruit thereof others make regeneration and repentance all one but that cannot so well stand for regeneration goeth before and repentance followeth after as a fruit thereof for godly sorrow which is a part of regeneration causeth repentance the minde therefore must first be renewed amp then it turneth it selfe vnto god and withall turneth the whole man and thus wee see what true repentance is ii point how must repentance be practised the practise of it standeth in two things in true humiliation and true reformation in humiliation a man humbleth himselfe vnder the hand of god making true confession of al his sinnes from a sorrowfull heart condemning himselfe for the same and earnestly crauing pardon for them at the hands of god in christ reformation is a change of all bad actions into good and if case require a making of satisfaction vnto others for iniuries done vnto them example hereof wee haue in dauid who hauing committed those two great sinnes of whoredome and murder when he was reproued by nathan repented confessing his sins and made the one and fiftie psalme and as it is thought the psalme therein notably shewing both his humiliation in heart and reformation of life so manasses when he was conuerted cro he repented humbling himselfe before god and praying for the pardon of his sinnes god heard him and thus came the prodigall child vnto his father saying luke father i haue sinned against heauen and before thee i am not worthie to be called thy son make me one of thine hired servant and so in all the psalmes of repentance wee shall see these duties of humiliation and reformation ioyntlie practised as psalm and and and here then consider the fearefull practise of the church of rome in their doctrine of repentance receiued generally for many hundred yeares repentance with them standeth in three things in contrition in confession of all his sinnes to the priests and in satisfaction to god by good works but all these things may a wicked man doe for iudas was greeued for betraying his maister he confessed his sinnes and also gaue againe the money wherwith he was hired a second abuse is that they make contrition a part of the practise of repentance by contrition we must vnderstand remorse of conscience for sinne which is no grace of it selfe though it may bee an occasion thereto in god elect a third abuse is that they prescribe a confession of all a mans sinnes vnto man which i a gibbet for any mans conscience wherein they require more than god doth a fourth abuse is that they require satisfaction to god iustice by mans good workes whereby they ouerthrow satisfaction by christ and exact that of man which none is able to performe we therefore must reiect their wicked doctrine brought by the diuell into god church and embrace that sauing repentance which standeth in true humiliation and reformation iii point who is it that commandeth repentance vnto this church namely iesus christ many not onely papists but protestant gather vpon this amp such like commandements that god giueth to euerie man sufficient grace to repent if he will for else say they hee should but mocke them in bidding them repent considering that without his grace it is as impossible for any man to repent as for a man to rise and walke that is fast bound hand and foote ans this collection is vnsound for the manifestation whereof i wil first lay down the grounds of the true answere and then apply the same first this commaundement to repent is not giuen to euerie man but only to the church of god or to that people which is to be a church and god giueth it to them for this end that hee may gather among them his elect in god church there be two sorts of man elect and reprobat both which are mingled in this life now when the commaundement to beleeue and repent is giuen out in god church it is directed properly to the elect and to the other whom god hath refused only by consequent because they are mingled with the elect againe these commandements bee giuen to the elect for two causes i to teach them not what they are able to doe of themselues but what they ought to doe ii to e an outward meanes to bring them to repent and beleeue for with the commandement christ is present by his spirit to worke in the elect grace to repent and beleeue philipp worke out your saluation in feare and trembling rendring this reason in the next words for god worketh in you both the wil and the deed in the church there be some reprobates who haue the same commandement giuen vnto them but for other vses as i to keepe them in outward order ii to teach them their owne impotencie iii and principally that god in his iustice may make them void of all excuse at the last day from hence i answer thus this proposition is not true to wit if god command man to repent then he giueth them grace to repent vnlesse it be thus qualified that god command them to repent for this end that they may practise repentance for god giueth out his commandements for diverse ends some that they may be practised amp others to take from man al excuse in their disobediece thus he commaunded pharaoh to let the people go that by his disobedience his heart might be more hardned and god more iustly manifest his glorie in his destruction so hee commaunded isay to go amp preach vnto the people not for their conuersion but to isa blind their eyes and to harden their harts and so he commands the reprobate to repent but neither directly as hee doth his children in whom he intends the practise of repentance but by consequent because they liue among his children nor yet with intent they should obey but rather to harden them and to make them inexcusable because of their sinnes and therefore in them his commandement cannot import anie abilitie to obey iv point who bee commanded to repent namely the church of ephesus that is the minister with the whole body of the church this may seeme strange that he should command them to repent seeing they had alreadie repented at their conuersion here therefore wee must learne that there bee two degree in the practise of repentance first the beginning of repentance secondly the renewing of the same and in those two consisteth the whole state of a christian mans life he must begin to repent when he is receiued to mercie he must renew that repentance for his daily offences if god therefore haue giuen s grace to repent we must not content our selues with that good beginning but adde more repentance daily vnto it for no man liueth that hath receiued grace to repent but hee seeth in himselfe continuall cause of renewing the same by reason of his daily s il and wants for euery sinne decayeth grace which must be repaired by a new practise of repentance this dutie must needs be practised it is the most dangerous case that can bee for any man to lie in sinne for sinne makes a man liable to all god iudgements and it is not so much the act of sinne as the lying in sinne that bringeth damnation for this cause paule corin speaking to those that were reconciled to god doth still most arnestly beg them to be reconciled vnto him saying we beg you in christs steed as though god did beg you through vs that ye be reconciled to god intending thereby to prouoke them to the daily renewing of their repentance that thereby they might get a more full assurance of their reconciliation v point for what must they repent namely for the decay of their loue not for the want thereof but for that they suffered it to waxe less both towards god and his word and towards their brother the same thing is spoken to vs dayly in the ministerie of the word that whereas our first loue is gone many hauing fallen from it and moe hauing none at all wee would vnfainedly repent of this our decay and want that if wee haue had loue and now waxe cold wee may renew it and if we neuer had it we may labour for it that so we may be answerable to his blessed desire and here obserue that christ enioyneth vs a strait repentance it is not ynough for man to repent them of grosse sinnes as whoredome theft drunkennesse and such like but they must repent them of their want of grace as of the knowledge and feare and loue of god and of brotherly loue and of decay in any grace bee it neuer so little wee haue many iusticiaries in conceit that bee pharisaically minded thinking too well of themselues that they need no repentance because they liue ciuilely and are not tainted with grosse sinnes but these consider little what god doth here require euen repentance for our secret wants and decayes and great reason it should bee so for els to what end should we examine our selues of our secret wants vnlesse wee should repent vs of them hauing found them in vs againe if this church must repent for her wants then what great cause haue we to repent in this last age of atheisme a grosse and common sinne of outward pride in apparrell a sinne flat against god word and for contempt of the gospell a sinne that enlargeth it selfe more and more among vs and for crueltie and want of mercy and compassion all which are rife in our church and may more easily remooue the candlesticke from vs then want of loue could remooue the candlesticke from this church and thus much for the second part of this remedie the third part of this remedie is to do their first workes that is shewe the like zeale and feruencie of loue to god to his word and to their brother that they did at the first time of their conuersion this duty christ addeth to the former because true repentance neuer perisheth in the heart but alwaies breaketh out into action in the life here then is an excellent lesson for vs to learne and put in practise wee must search our own harts and see what good things haue bene in vs what good motions and desires or good affections we must also call to mind our former wayes and see what good things wee haue done and if in heart or life we find decay we must recouer our losse and seeke to do our first workes and striue to continue so doing to our liues end that so wee may escape this heauie charge of decay in grace thus much of the parts of this remedie if not i will come against thee shortly and remooue thy candlesticke out of his place except thou amend in these words christ layes downe a reason to persuade the church of ephesus to the practise of the former remedy especially for repentance this reason containeth three parts i a generall commination in these words if not i wil come against thee shortly ii a particular threatning of a particular iudgement and remoue thy candlesticke out of his place iii the condition of them both except thou amend i point if not i will come against thee shortly that is if thou do not practise this remedie and the duties therein prescribed especially the dutie of repentance then will i come against thee shortly the words may as well bee read thus if not then will i come to thee shortly for so they are in the originall and doe containe in them sufficient and profitable instruction god is said to come to any people two wayes in mercie and in iudgement in mercie when he testifieth his presence by workes of mercie as when christ in spirit went vnto the old world and preached vnto them in the person of noe an hundred and twentie yeares before the floud pet secondly god commeth in iudgement when hee testifieth his presence by iudgements in the second commandement god saith he wil visite the sinnes of the fathers vpon the children that is he will make inquirie among the children for the fathers sinnes and if hee find them to liue in the same sinnes that their fathers did then will hee punish them this is properly to visit so in this place if thou repent not i will come vnto thee and testifie my presence not in mercie but in iudgement in this generall threatening we may obserue that when a church or people decay in loue to god to his word or to their brother or els lye in any sinne then god prepareth himselfe to come vnto them in iudgement amo because i will doe thus and thus vnto thee for thy sinnes therefore prepare to meete thy god oh israell meaning that because they lay still in their sinnes therefore he would make knowne his presence by more fearefull iudgements this doctrine according to christs direction is to bee applied to vs and to our church for the sinnes that were in the church of ephesus are the sinnes of our church and people they decayed in loue to god to his word and to the brother so doe we nay generally there is no loue at all in vs as hath been shewed and besides these wants there be many other grosse sinnes wherein our church and people doe lye as in atheisme both in iudgement and practise in contempt and neglect of god worship and true religion in crueltie oppression and want of mercie and that which is more though god summon man to repent by his dayly iudgements yet few or none by true humilitie prepare to meete god and to preuent his iudgements securitie spreads it selfe ouer the whole bodie of our people and this being our case and state it must needes bee that god hath beene long since in comming to vs by his iudgements and a this day he is still comming because we still decay in loue and other graces and more and more goe on in sinne so that if we thus continue the truth is hee will come shortly vnto vs and that by most fearefull iudgements for this was written to the church of ephesus to be a direction not onely vnto them but to all churches to the end of the world that be in the like or worser case what shall wee then doe our dutie is taught vs in these words if not that is if thou repent not wee must preuent the lord comming in iudgement by vnfained repentance euery man and euery familie apart must repent priuately and the whole church openly and publickely no way else wee haue to stay the lord comming against vs by his fearefull iudgements the second part of this reason is a more particular threatening than the former and will remooue thy candlesticke out of his place where hee sheweth with what particular iudgement hee will punish this church namely by remoouing away the candlesticke the meaning whereof may bee gathered out of the former chapter where particular churches were called candlestickes therefore here hee threateneth to remooue his church from the citie of ephesus to take away the ministerie of his gospell and the profession thereof and in his iust iudgement to send among them ignorance apostacie and heresie in steed of the knowledge of his truth this particular iudgement must be referred to the first words if not that is if thou repent not this will i doe i will make thee to be no church and take my gospell from thee in this particular threatening three points are to bee obserued one concerning the minister the second concerning the whole body of the church the third concerning euery priuat man touching the minister note this if he shall decay in loue to god to his word or to his brother or if hee lye in any one sinne knowne to himselfe it is a meanes to depriue him either of his calling or of god gifts bestowed on him for this threatening is here directed especially vnto the angell of this church of ephesus when ieremie had beene wanting in deliuering the lord will vnto the people partly for feare amp partly through impatience then the lord becomes a prophet vnto him saying if thou ier returne i will bring thee againe and thou shalt stand before me whereby hee would giue him to vnderstand that if hee returned not he should cease to be a prophet vnto him the same thing is true of all god ministers if they decay in loue faile in their dutie or lye in any sinne they must speedily renew themselues by repentance or els god will depriue them either of their calling or of the gifts thereof true repentance and the renewing thereof is needfull vnto all christians but especially to god ministers if they would continue in his fauour and stand before him becomming his mouth vnto the people the second point concerneth the whole bodie of a church to wit if a church or people decay in loue to god to religion and to their brother or doe lye in any common sinne they procure hereby the remoouing of the gospell from them and the abolishing of true religion h the prophet is a sayth the lord and the man of the spirit i mad this was a great and fearefull iudgement but mark the cause all is thine iniquitie that is for the sinne of the whole church doth god send foolish ministers if this bee so then wee haue iust cause in our church to feare the remoouing of the gospell from vs for there is a generall decay of loue in many and in the most no loue at all many scorne and contemn true religion and hate the professours thereof in regard whereof wee may wonder at the great patience of god that yet continueth his gospell among vs for thess god giueth man vp to strong delusion to beleeue lyes because they loue not his truth wherefore being in this danger our dutie is to vse all good meanes to preuent this iudgement of god which can no other way bee done than by true and vnfained repentance by the whole church in generall and by euery man apart and euery familie apart for when god shall speake suddenly against a nation or kingdome to root it vp and to destroy it if that people repent of their wickednesse the lord will repent of the plague and iudgement which hee thought to bring vpon them ierem verse the third point concerneth euery priuate man and it is this if any man decay in loue or want loue to god and to his brother or lye in any sin knowne to himselfe this is a meanes to remooue the candlesticke from him to depriue him of his knowledge and other graces of god the affection of loue in the heart is like the watch of the clocke if the watch stand the wheeles stand as the watch goeth fast or softly so goe the wheeles answerably and so it is in man if his loue to god and to his gospell doe encrease then doth his knowledge and other graces of god encrease in his heart but if his loue decay then other graces decay and if loue be gone then farewell all pietie and true religion if we would know the cause of such palpable ignorance as is in many that haue long heard the gospell preached it is nothing but want of loue heb the holy ghost sheweth by what degrees man come to fall away from god first sinne deceiues them by drawing them to commit it then their hearts are hardened by custome of sinning thence followes vnbeleefe in maine points of religion and so they make apostacie from god and set themselues against his truth take heed therefore of lying in any sinne for that is the high way to finall apostacie rather striue to encrease in loue vnto god and vnto his word and so shall all his good graces encrease in thine heart out of this particular threatening some gather that a man may bee cut off fro christ amp fall away finally from true faith and repentance for say they if a whole church may bee cut off from christ and become no church then may any one member of the church be cut off and become no member but a whole church may bee cut off as here we see and therefore may any one man answer this reason is not good there is great difference betweene the state of a whole church and of one man that is a true member of christ for a particular church is a mixt company of true professors and dissemblers like vnto a field wherein are good corne and tares and like vnto a barne floore wherein is wheat and chaffe mingled together and yet all are reputed beleeuers because they professe the gospell outwardly now by reason of this mixture it may come to passe that a particular visible church may fall away and become no church either when the godly are taken away and hypocrites and dissemblers made manifest or els when true beleeuers waxing few are not able to maintaine the publicke profession of the truth against the might and multitude of the enemy which may dayly encrease but the case is not so with a particular member of christ he cannot finally fall away as hath beene shewed at large verse and thus much for the second part of this reason the third part of this reason is the condition of both the former threatenings in these words except th amend that is i will come in iudgement vnto thee and take my gospell from thee vnlesse thou preuent my comming by true repentance here note that all the threatenings of the old and new testament are conditionall commeth to niniue and crieth yet fortie dayes and niniue shall bee destroyed he sayd no more but yet that threatening must bee vnderstood with this exception vnlesse they repent why wil some say are the threatenings in god word propounded conditionally answer god whole will and pleasure is one alone in itselfe and yet it may bee thus distinguished to bee partly secret and partly reuealed god secret will is touching those things which hee hath not made manifest vnto man his reuealed will is touching those things which are manifested in scripture or doe fall out euery day now god secret will is without condition for as euery thing commeth to passe so god willed it when good things come to passe them he willeth simply when euill things fall out them he permitteth to be done and to make god secret will conditionall is to bring god will vnder the power of man and to subiect the creator vnto the creature but god reuealed will is conditionall because it containeth the matter of mans saluation and this manner of propounding it is a most effectuall way to bring the same to passe for it keepeth man more in awfull obedience than if it were absolute in this condition note this thing that christ repeateth it twice both in the beginning of this reason if not and in the end except thou amend hereby hee would giue vs to vnderstand that when man commit sinne and lye therein or when they decay in any grace then haue they most necessarie cause to repent if they would escape god fearefull iudgements and seeing our estate is like to the state of this church or els worser by much for wee lye in sinne and thereby cause god to come to vs in iudgement as we tender our owne good both in this life and after death let vs turne from our sinnes and repent euery man apart euery familie apart and the whole church publickely for repentance is most needfull els would not the lord haue doubled this condition these words are a second reason to prooue that which was set downe in the second verse namely that this church could not abide them that were euill in the second verse this was made manifest by their discovery of the false apostles and here he prooueth it by their affection of hatred towards the workes of the nicolaitans these nicolaitans were certaine heretickes in the primitiue church that held these two opinions first that adulterie and fornication were no sins secondly that man might communicate with the sacrifices of idolaters in their idoll temples and according to their opinions were their practises these heretickes as it is thought came of one nicholas one of the seuen deacons mentioned acts who though for a while hee did faithfully discharge his dutie outwardly yet after fell away and became the head of this hereticall sect but this thou hast this particle but hath reference to the former verse as if hee should say though this be thy fault that thou failest in thy first loue yet for this i commend thee that thou hatest the workes of the nicolaitans this practise of christ discouereth the common sinne of this age which is to set out in their colours mens faults and infirmities to their greatest disgrace and yet by silence and obliuion to burie all their vertues which are prayse worthie this ought not to bee so wee must follow christs example who with iust reproofe adioyneth due deserued praise if our friend or our foe haue a fault when we are called thereunto wee may speake of it and wee must reprooue them but yet withall we must commend the good things that be in them secondly christ here teacheth vs that it is not sufficient to anymans good estate before god that hee haue good things in him for that a man may haue and yet bee in danger to bee cut off from christ saule had good things in him at the first entrance into his kingdome but what was hee afterward john was verie zealous for god glorie in killing all the idolatrous priests king but he would not depart from the sinnes of ieroboam and iudas no doubt had many good gifts while he was with christ but his end was most fearefull and this church had many good things in her yet i she in danger of being cut off from christ and so many among vs haue excell t gifts some for knowledge some for and conceiuing of prayer amp yet for all these they may be cut off from christ therefore wee must not content our selues with these but labour for the principall which is true hearty and vnfained repentance which wee must dayly renew for our continuall fals and this will keepe vs in god fauour and from his iudgements more particularly christ here commendeth this church for hating the errours of the nicolaitans whereby hee would teach vs our dutie if wee bee christians namely to take knowledge of the sinnes and errours of our times and to hate the same vnfainedly yet note he commendeth them for hating their workes not their persons giuing vs direction how to temper our hatred in the world we must set it against the sinne not against the person of any man some will say the prophets prayed against the persons of the wicked and dauid professed hatred of the man psalm doe not i hate them that hate thee answer dauid was an extraordinarie prophet and no doubt had this reuealed vnto him that those his enemy were obstinate and would not repent againe imprecations of the prophets in scripture must bee vnderstood as prophecies of god iudgement to come vpon those against whome they prayed but wee which want that extraordinarie spirit must keepe our selues to our ordinarie rule hate the sinnes and loue the persons further obserue the workes here hated namely idolatry and adulterie which are ioyned together in these nicolaitans adulterie is the punishment of idolatry and idolatry the punishment of adulterie spirituall adulterie is punished with bodily adulterie this was verified in the old iewes when they fell a whoring after strange god god gaue them vp to vncleane lust and it is palpable in the church of rome they being fallen to idolatry doe abound in all vncleanenesse for they tollerate stewes for fornication and adulterie and sodomic are common among them againe sundry man may here be well admonished who will bee of no religion because there are many sects and schismes among the professours thereof these man should consider that in the best churches planted by the apostles there were sects and heresies euen in the apostles times as here in ephesus and therefore no maruell if there bee sects and schismes among vs at this day this offence should not mooue any to dislike the gospell but rather cause them more firmely to cleaue vnto the truth which i also doe hate this christ addeth to encourage them to goe forward in the vertue for which hee commended them in hating euill workes for what could more prouoke them to zeale and constancie therein than to know they did that which christ himselfe did and here wee see that christ would haue euery member of his church to be like minded and like affected vnto him as he was man wee must loue those things which christ loueth and hate those things which christ hateth reioyce wherein christ reioyceth and mourne for those things for which christ mourned and great reason it should be so for wee professe our selues to be members of christ bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh for out of his bloud sprung the church and there must bee consent and conformitie betweene the head and the members quest if christ hated these wicked man why did hee suffer them to liue and not cut them off from troubling his church answer because hereby hee would manifest his loue to his church and his iustice vpon the wicked for hee can bring light out of darkenesse and good not onely out of good but out of euill these words containe the conclusion of this epistle the scope whereof is to excite this church to the more carefull performance of the duties before prescribed this conclusion hath two parts a commaundement and a promise the commaundement in the beginning of the verse let him that hath a are he ar what the spirit sayth vnto the churches in this commaundement note three points i who are commaunded these which haue eares ii the dutie commaunded they must heare iii what they must heare namely what the spirit sayth vnto the churches i point the parties commanded are thus set forth he which hath an eare who these bee christ doth more fully expound matth when hee saith let him that hath an eare to heare heare where he maketh this distinction of hearers that some are deafe hearers some hearing hearers the deafe hearers are those that bring with them to the ministerie of the word their outward eares only but their hearts are not affected with it neither do they care to learne to beleeue or obey that which is taught them the hearing hearers are all such as beside their bodily eares haue eares pi ced in their hearts by the spirit of grace whereby they doe not onely heare the word outwardly but their hearts are also affected with it and made pliable vnto it so as they beleeue it and bring forth obedience vnto it this hearing eare is set foorth by dauid when he saith psalm sacrifice and burnt offer thou wouldest not haue but mine ares hast thou opened and prepar d and then i sayd lo i come hereof isay saith thou isa openedst mine eares and i was no rebellious and this hearing eare giuen her when god act opened her heart whereby she became attentiue to the word of god preached by paule by this distinction of hearers which christ maketh we may learne that god grace vnto saluation is not vniuersal that is god giueth not vnto al man such measure of grace whereby if they will themselues they may beleeue repent and be saued for in christs time and euer since there haue bene in the church these two kind of hearers whereof the deafe hearer doth not receiue nor beleeue the gospell vnto saluation neither is it true that god giueth grace sufficient vnto all whereby they might be saued if they by their malice and sinne did not abolish the same for though he admit all sorts into his church yet not all but some onely haue eares pierced by the spirit of grace that they can heare and therefore when the disciples asked christ mat why hee spake in parables he answered thus to you it is giuen to know the will of god and the secrets of his kingdom but to others it is not giuen shewing plainly that the gift of hearing to saluation is not giuen to all and in some made void by their own wilfulnesse but to some it is giuen and they haue hearing eares and to some it is not giuen and their eares are deafe secondly seeing this commaundement is directed to the hearing hearers we must hereby be admonished to vse all good meanes to become good hearers of god word bringing with vs not onely the bodily eares which we haue by creation but the spirituall eares of the heart which we haue by regeneration for it is not sufficient to our saluation to receiue the word into the outward bodily eares vnlesse the inward eares of the heart bee opened that our soule may bee affected with the word and fitted to receiue to beleeue and obey the same thus did good king i sias heare the law read the text saith chr his heart within him and thus did dauid heare when the lord sayd to the church ps seeke ee my face his heart answered i seeke thy face o lord and as we must bee carefull to get spirituall eares so wee must take heede of deafe eares which is when a man commeth amp heareth the word of god but yet hath no care in his heart to learne beleeue or obey the same this deafe eare is a fearefull iudgement of god whereof we may read isay where the prophet is sent to make their eares heauie and their harts fat that they might not beare nor beleeue lest they should turne and be saued and this the rather we must looke vnto because it is a iudgement of god vpon many among vs at this day the greatest part of hearers are deafe hearers which appeareth by this that after long teaching they neitheir increase in knowledge nor in faith nor in obedience but remaine the same for blindnesse of mind hardnesse of hart and profanenesse of life that they were at their first hearing of the word these must know that god iudgement is on them and if they would bee saued they must labour to come out of this estate amp endeuour so to heare with their hearts that they may be turned vnto god both in mind heart and life ii point the dutie commaunded namely to heare hearing in scripture is not onely to listen with the bodily eare but to be attetiue to that which is taught and with attention to bring faith conuersion and obedience euery way ephesians the hearing of christ is notably described it is not so much to conceiue the doctrine of christ in our mind and to be able to vtter it as to die vnto sinne and to the lusts of the flesh and to ris new sse of life and indeed a man doth heare and learne no more of god word than hee doth beleeue and practise from whence we are again to be admonished that we so heare with attention that by hearing we suffer our selues to be changed and that with our change we ioyne are to beleeue and conscience to obey this i that sauing hearing which bringeth eternall life all other hearing doth increase our sinnes to our further condemnation whereby also appeareth the fearefull state of many who lend onely the outward bodily eare to h re the word but then hearts bee not mooued nor their liues changed thereby iii point what is to be heard namely that which the spirit saith nto churches which words must bee referred to that which went be ore amp not to that which followeth for thi commaundement belongs to the matter of the epistle which went before the promise following rather concerne the persons themselues than the matter the things then that are to bee heard are these christ his sharpe reproofe for sin his threatnings of punishment a remedie prescribed amp motiues to practise the same especially repentance for of all these christ spake before from this that christ bids them heare these things which cocerned their estate in sinnes amp amendment by repentance we learne two things first that it is a most necessarie thing for euerie church of god and euerie member thereof to know and consider their own wants and sinnes and also the iudgements of god that hang ouer them for the same secondly that after any man or any church hath considered of theri sinnes and of god iudgements it is a most necessary thing to turne vnto god by true repentance if they haue not repented and if they haue repented to renew the same daily amp do it more that so god iudgements both priuat and common may be auoided we therefore must hereby be moued to search into our own wayes to find out our owne sinnes and to consider of god iudgements thereby deserued that by true repentance wee may turne vnto god and so escape his fearefull iudgement further these words what the spirit saith vnto the churches containe reasons to moue euerie man to heare i because they are spoken the spirit that is the holy ghost ii because they spoken to one man o one church alone but to all churche for the first it may demanded seein christ sp ke th se word how be sayd that the spirit speaketh the ans both may stand first because all the outward of person in are common to the to each the church is an outward action of christ and therefore it agreeth to the father and to the holy ghost as when the father created thing in the beginning the son also created and the holy ghost created them so her when the son eacheth the father teacheth and the holy ghost teacheth for as the three persons are one in nature so must they be ioyned in all outward actions secondly christ saith the spirit speaketh because he now sitting at the right hand of the father doth not teach his church in bodily presence but hy his spirit which after his ascention hee sent to be their comforter and instructor here then obserue that the holy ghost speaketh to the church in scripture the church of rome appoints a iudge to speake vnto man in al matters of controuersie which is the church because say they a iudge must speake and christ is absent from his church and the word is a dumbe letter and cannot speake therefore the church must needes bee iudge but they erre grosly the church cannot be iudge it is but christs minister to put in execution that which hee commandeth christ therefore must bee iudge vnto his church by scripture which is not a dumbe iudge for therein his spirit speaketh plainely and sufficiently for the resoluing of any point in controuersie that is needfull in god church the second reason to attention is because these things are spoken to all churches where we see that things spoken to one church agree to all from whence we must learne this speciall dutie in reading and hearing god holy word namely to read and heare with applicacation we must not rest in a flourishing knowledge of the storie but apply euery precept and example vnto our selues if it be an example of vertue wee must apply it to our selues for imitation if it be an example of vice we must apply it to our selues to moue vs to eschew and auoid the like for god would haue all to learne that which hee speaketh vnto one and thus much of the commandement to him that ouercommeth will i giue to eate of the tree of life which is in the middest of the paradise of god these words containe the second part of this conclusion to wit a most excellent promise wherein consider two points first to whom it is made secondly what is promised for the first the promise is made to him that ouercommeth that is to him that in fighting preuaileth against all the spirituall enemy of his saluation sinne sathan hell and condemnation there bee three things requisit to make a man able to ouercome these enemy first he must be borne anew in christ of water and of the spirit ioh he that is borne of god ouercommeth the world so by regeneratio he is freed from the bondage of hell death sinne and sathan secondly hee must haue true faith by vertue whereof hee must denie and renounce himselfe and bee whatsoeuer he is in the death passion amp obediece of christ therfore s john saith in the same place this is the ictorie which ouercommeth the world euen your faith for when a man is in christ by faith hee is made partaker of christ his victorie vpon the crosse and by it receiueth power to subdue his owne corruptions the world and the diuell thirdly hee that would ouercome must keepe faith that is true religion and a good conscience standing out in life and death against all aduersarie power whatsoeuer in this that life euerlasting is promised to them that ouercome first we obserue that the doctrine of vniuersall grace affirming that the promises of the gospell for life and saluation belong to all and euerie man whatsoeuer vnlesse hee will reiect them is a deuice of mans braine for life eternall is not promised to euerie man as he is a man comming of adam but to a man as hee is in christ by faith and a new creature the promises of the gospell bee vniuersall indeed to all that ouercome but that is a propertie which restraines them wholly to true beleeuers secondly hereby we are taught so to liue that we may say truly in the testimonie of a good conscience we haue ouercome all our spirituall enemy and do continually stand conquerours ouer them this is a matter of endlesse ioy amp comfort which will cheere the soule in greatest distresse but to liue and lie in sinne is or will bee a hell to the conscience what auaile the treasures amp honors of this world to any man while his conscience shall tell him he is a vassall to sinne and sathan for while he continueth in that estate he is out of the fauour of god and hath no part nor portion in the kingdome of heauen therefore it standeth vs vpon to labour to feele in our harts the certaine euidence of this victorie ouer our spirituall enemy by the sure testimonie of the spirit of grace the second point is the thing promised to wit life euerlasting noted by this gift to eate of the tree of life and it is set out vnto vs by two circumstances first by the cause of it secondly by the place where it is to bee found the cause is christ iesus i will giue to him to eat of the tree of life where he maketh an opposition betweene himselfe and the first adam the first adam sinned and thereby cast himselfe with all his posterity out of the earthly paradise and lost the benefit of the tree of life but christ the second adam commeth and suffereth for sinne and thereby openeth the way to a better paradise than the first adam lost and to all that ouercome he giueth libertie to enter in and to eate of the tree of life the tree of life properly was a tree placed in the middest of the earthy paradise and it was so called first because it was a pledge and sacrament vnto adam that he should liue for euer if hee continued in obedience to god secondly because it had in it as may be proued vertue and power whereby it would haue preserued him from death and old age for euer if hee had stood in his innocencie this earthly tree of life was a figure and signe of christ our sauiour and mediator who liueth an eternall spirituall life not onely as hee is god but as hee is mediator and that not for himself alone but for this end that h e may conuey quickning spirituall life to all that beleeue in him and for this cause hee tearmeth himselfe the tree of life further he saith he will giue hereof to eate to eate sometime signifieth to beleeue john but it cannot heare be so taken for faith endeth with this life and hath no vse afterward therefore to eate in this place signifieth to haue immediat fellowship with christ in heauen where christ shall bee vnto him a tree of life to make him liue for euer in this promise note two points i in what things eternal life consisteth namely in immediat fellowship and communion with christ in heauen secondly that life eternall standeth not in outward meanes as meat drinke clothing physicke recreation sleepe and such like but in an immediat partaking with christ in all his blessings so that when christ is all in all vnto vs immediatly then do we eat of the tree of life and therby shall liue eternally ii circumst the place where eternall life is to be had is in the paradise of god this paradise of god is the third heauen a place wherein the lord doth manifest himself in his glorious maiesty and which he hath prepared for the glory of all his elect hereof christ spake to the the fe on the crosse saying this day thou shalt be with me in paradise luke and hither was paule wrapped in vision and saw and heard things that cannot bee vttered and he calleth it the third heauen in respect of the heauens vnder it for the place wherein we breath is the first heauen the starrie firmament is the second heauen and this paradise of god is the third which is therefore called paradise because it is a place of endlesse ioy and pleasure and the adding of the name of god doth not onely put a difference betweene it and adams earthly paradise but also sheweth it to be a great and most excellent place so rabel saith i haue wrestled with my sister en the wrestlings of god that is strong wrestlings and in the psalmes the mountaines of god do signifie high and mightie mountaines and that this paradise is such an excellent place appeareth at large revelation for therein must come none vncleane thing but the saints and angels do there enioy the presence of god and behold his glorie so much as the creature is able to comprehend there god communicateth himselfe to all the elect and becommeth all things vnto the immediatly so that this must needs be place of all ioy and comfort the consideration whereof must admonish vs to seeke the thing that bee aboue that wee may haue a place in this heauenly paradise for why should we set our heart vpon the vaine glorie of this world which passeth away as a shadow and commeth to nothing and in the end is but labour and sorrow when wee haue all that the world can affoord but the ioyes and glorie of this paradise of god bee endlesse and vnspeakeable let vs therefore denie our selues depend vpon christ and in all things keepe faith and a good conscience vnto the end and thus much for the first epistle in this verse and the rest that follow to the twelfth i layd downe the second letter or epistle of christ to another church of asia called smyrna before the epistle christ giues a second particular commaundement vnto john touching the writing hereof vnto this church in these words and vnto the angell of the church of the smirnians write which is prefixed to this epistle that this church and all other churches of god might bee assured that had sufficient warrant and calling for the writing hereof which thing is necessarie to euerie pen man of the holie ghost that the church need not to doubt of the authoritie of scripture but receiue the same as the pure word of god hence we may gather that all ordinarie ministers of the gospell must haue warrant and calling for euery doctrine which they teach in god church for the apostles that were extraordinarie man of mo e xcellent gifts might doe nothing without warrant of the parts of this commaundement we spake in the first verse of this chapter the epistle it selfe followeth containing thr e parts a preface a proposition and a conclusion the preface containeth a preparation to the matter of the epistle in these words these things sayth e that is the first to last which was dead and is aliue in this preface he sheweth in whose name this epistle was written vnto this church namely in christs name which he setteth downe for two causes first to stir vp the people in this church to a religious attention and a reuerent care of receiuing the things therin written as the pure words of christ iesus secondly because no commaundement in the matter of god worship and religion is to be receiued from any creature but from christ alone and therefore this epistle concerning the true worship and religion of god is propounded in his name alone in this preface christ is described by two notable arguments first to be the first and the last second that he was dead but is aliue the meaning of them both was shewed in the and verses of the former chapter whence they are borrowed by the first christ would signifie that he is euerliuing god without beginning or ending before all creatures and after them by the second that hee is true man and assumed mans nature to suffer death for our sinnes and rose againe to liue for euer and to giue to man eternall life in this description two points of doctrine are expressed i that christ is a person consisting of two natures godhead and manhood he is the first and the last and therefore god he was dead and is aliue and therefore is true man if any aske how one person can consist of two natures answer as bodie and soule concurre to make one man so the godhead and manhood of christ concurre to make one christ and therefore are vnited ii doctr here is the foundation of all true comfort vnto god church and people in any miserie or afflictio which standeth in two points first that christ is able to helpe them in any miserie either by freeing them quite from it or easing them in it seeing hee is god the first and last secondly that as he is able so he is willing and readie to helpe them for he is man who tooke on him our nature died for vs and rose againe vnto life to giue to vs eternall life this is the very scope and end for which christ thus describeth himselfe to this church that was in affliction here then wee haue direction where and whence to seeke for true comfort tribulation of this life namely wee must haue recourse to christ and in him onsider both his abilitie and his willingnesse to ase all children in affliction and by these wee must arme our selues against d spair and against immoderate grief and sorrow vnder the crosse here beginneth the proposition of this epistle containing the matter and substance of the whole epistl this proposition hath two parts a commendation of this church and counsell how to behaue selfe in the time to come the commendation is in this ninth verse wherewithall are mingled some comfort vnto this church being in affliction i kn w thy work these word were handled in the former epistle the meaning breefely is this i know all thy dealings amp thy waies i know the whole tenor of thy life and i doe withall well like and approoue of them here christ setteth downe an excellent propertie touching himselfe namely that he seeth and knoweth all things whatsoeuer nothing is hid from him and that this church might bee resolued hereof hee repeateth this vnto them i know thy workes neither is it any vaine repetition being indeed the ground of all true pietie and syncere obedience wee therefore in a our affaires are here taught to labour to bee fully resolued in our consciences that christ is with vs and seeth vs and knoweth the whole tenour of our wayes in thoughts words and eds dauid had learned this when as he sayd psalm thou knowest my sitting and my rising thou vnderstandest my thoughts a farre off thou compassest my paths and my lying downe and article accustomed vnto all my wayes there is not a word in my toung but thou knowest it wholly this persuasion is very necessarie for it will moue a man to make conscience of euery thought word and action and of his whole behauiour but where this persuasion is wanting there is no religion in the heart nor good behauior in the life when this takes place religion beginneth and encreaseth with it so doth good conscience and true obedience for hee that hath the lord alwayes before him will not greatly fall psalm and tribulation marke here how workes that is a godly conuersation and tribulation goe together hence we learne that god will haue tribulations ioyned with his grace where hee bestowes his graces there also hee layeth tribulation and that for weightie causes as to humble them for their sinnes past to make triall of their faith and other graces and to preuent in them sinnes to come the consideration wherof must mooue all god children in this our church to looke for some tribulation for god hath bestowed among vs plentie of his graces with long peace and many outward blessings and his will is that trouble and affliction should accompanie the same further christ saying i know thy tribulations would hereby comfort this church as if hee should say true it is thou article in great trouble but it commeth not by chaunce but by the speciall prouidence of my father and i do know and regard the same psalm the raising vp of the poore and needie is made a fruit of god beholding the things that are done vpon the earth this is an excellent comfort for any church or people that be in affliction for when they shall know that beside the hand of god therein christ iesus regardeth their sorrowes this must needes arme them with long suffering and ioyfulnesse we in this church as hath beene shewed may persuade our selues that god will send tribulations among vs now when they come what shall we doe shall wee sinke vnder them no but wee must now forecast to vse the meanes whereby we may stay our hearts vnder the smart and burden of them that is by setling our hearts in this persuasion that christ seeth our affliction and withall hath speciall care to comfort or deliuer vs as hee seeth most for his glory and the good of our soule in the next words christ setteth downe two kinds of tribulations in this church pouertie and repro h by pouertie he meaneth want of temporall things to maintaine this naturall life where obserue sundry things i that true religion and pietie will not free any from outward pouertie the religion of this church was excellent and yet they were in want and therefore let no man think because he is godly he shall bee rich or not fall into pouertie if it be sayd godlinesse hath the promise not onely of the life to come but also of this life that is of earthly blessings and riches i answere it is true but yet with difference eternall blessings onely are promised absolutely and temporall blessings with restraint namely if they serue for god glory and the good of his children otherwise they must want as this church did ii the lord would comfort this church in her pouertie by saying that hee knew it and regarded it where wee see a meanes to comfort all those that be in want of outward blessings they must consider that christ seeth amp obserueth their want whatsoeuer and if they be his servant he will free them from it so it bee for his glory and the good of their soules or els arme them with patience to beare it if they pray vnto him iii christ here approueth of works where he acknowledgeth pouertie so that good workes and pouertie may stand together and therefore good workes doe not consist onely in large a mes as the church of rome would haue it though these haue due reward and prayse in their place but euery worke of a mans lawful calling done in obedience to god with an honest heart from a good conscience and for god glory is a good worke bee the calling neuer so base thus may the shepheard please god in his calling as well as the magistrate or minister for it is not the matter of the worke that commends it vnto god but the manner of doing but thou article rich here christ intendeth both to prayse and to comfort this church as if hee should say notwithstanding thy outward pouertie yet thou article rich in god luke man are rich in god in two respects i when they are reconciled to god in the merites of christ corinthian christ became poore for our sakes that we through his pouertie might be made rich that is that wee might haue the pardon of sinne and bee receiued into god fauour hereupon dauid cals the lord his portion and his cup and durable riches and righteousnesse are with wisedome proverb ii when they receiue his grace whereby they are enabled to bring forth good works both in duties to god and man of this paule speaketh when he exhorteth rich man to be rich in good works and to lay vp for themselues a good foundation against the time to come tim in this commendation sundry duties are to be learned i poore man are here taught seeing god denieth vnto them earthly riches and wealth to labour to be rich in god to bee reconciled vnto him in christ and to get such grace that they may doe good duties both vnto god and man in faith and with a good conscience ii rich man on whom god bestoweth outward wealth must hereby be admonished to embrace paules charge tim aboue all things seeke for true riches in the liuing god and not suffer these outward blessings to puffe vp their minds but vse them as meanes to make the rich in god by getting god grace doing good workes and distributing to the poore this admonition is most necessarie for though the promises of god grace be not denied vnto the rich yet sure it is riches doe choke the seede of grace in the heart and hinder the care man ought to haue for spirituall riches and hence it commeth that moe of the poorer sort receiue and obey the gospell than of the rich iii herein behold the madnesse of the world for the most mens greatest labour and care is after worldly wealth and honour neuer regarding the true treasures of god grace which will commend them vnto god when the other must perish and the wicked owners thereof let vs therefore iudge as christ doth of true riches and accordingly labour to be rich in his igh the second part of their tribulation is the reproch and blasphemie of their enemy in these words i kn w the blasphemie of them which say they are iewes and are not ampc that is i know the greeuous slaunders and reuilings which thine enemy fasten vpon thee for blasphemie signifieth not onely speeches of disgrace against god but also against man as na b was accused king to blasphemed god and the king and of this paule sayth when wee are re led wee blesse when wee are blasphemed wee pray corinthian hence wee learne that all churches and man that desire truely to serue god and to keepe good consciences must looke for slaunders and reuilings neither must this seeme strange vnto them for christ hath sayd it must bee so nay rather they might maruell if they should suffer no reproches for christs sake seeing hee hath sayd cursed are you when all man speake well of you luke it is indeed a greeuous thing to bee so euill rewarded for well doing but this must bee their comfort and ground of patience that christ heareth and knoweth euery reproch and will in his good time remedie the same the persons which blaspheme this church are thus described which say they be iewes and are not but are of the synagogue of sathan as in other famous cities so in smyrna dwelt some of the iewes who had their synagogues that is such places of assemblies where they serued god after their manner and though they denied christ yet they thought themselues to be the onely true worshippers of god in all the world and therefore did blaspheme and raile vpon the christians that beleeued in christ and of these christ sayth though by birth they were iewes yet indeed they were not the israell of god nor his true worshippers as they accounted themselues whereby in generall we may see from whom come railings and reproches on god servant namely from those which say they are true worshippers of god and are not for he is not a iew that is outwardpunc rom he therefore that slandereth the truth and the professors thereof is an enemie to christ as well as to his servant for no friend of christ can possibly speake euill of his gospell and religion this should be considered for the comfort of the godly because they that endeuour to serue god in synceritie are of all man most subiect to reproch hee that refraineth from euill maketh himselfe a prey isay touching these iewes two points are to bee considered i what they are in their owne opinion ii what they are in the iudgement of christ for the first because they were iewes by birth descending from abraham isaac and iacob god auntient servant therefore they thought themselues the onely true worshippers of god as their forefathers were and this is the manner of all wicked man to blesse psalm themselues in their wickednesse and whatsoeuer they doe yet still to say and thinke god will blesse them take an heretick who ouerthrowes the truth of god by his errors and he will say he teacheth that which in conscience hee is persuaded is the truth for which hee will shed his bloud and whereto he would haue all man yeeld so take a professed witch man or woman they will say all that they doe is by the power of the good angels and by some speciall gifts giuen vnto them aboue others but they will not bee brought to acknowledge that they doe any thing by vertue of their league with the devil from whence indeed commeth all they can doe and so the carnall protestant of our time they looke for god blessings in this life and for eternall life by christ after death and yet walke in the broad way to destruction in sinne amp profanesse thus they blesse themselues in their euill wayes and make christ a pack horse for their iniquities but in the example of these iewes we must learn to lay downe all presumptuous thoughts of our owne goodnesse and vaine persuasions of god fauor without his true grace and rather looke vnto our sinnes and bee humbled for them that god may lift vs vp ii point christs iudgement of them is this they are not iewes but a synagogue of sathan that is a company of man that seemed to serue god after the iewish maner but did indeed worship the deuill herein are many things to be considered i how this could be true of any company of the iewes who were the chosen people of god answer election is twofold speciall and generall god speci ll election is when in his eternall couns ll he chuseth a man to life eternall and his befell not all the iewes but some onely god generall election is he he ouchsafeth any people to become his visible church to haue and the outward signe and his co e ant amp thus was the of the jew elected and therefore were circumcised and receiued the passeouer from this generall election a church and people may fall as the iewes did and so became the synagogue of sathan being indeed neuer within the particular calling from which a man cannot fall away for god election remaineth s e tim his calling is without repentance rom ii point at what time did the iewes begin to be a synagogue of sathan answer not at the crucifying of the lord of life though that were a most heinous sinne for though some therin sinned of malice yet many did it of ignorance this peter confess th acts and therfore in his first sermon after christs ascension telleth them that the belonged to them and to that were a farre off act but when the apostles had a long time preached christ vnto them amp conuinced their consciences out of the old testament that he was the true messias and yet they remained obstinate reiecting and persecuting both them and their doctrine then they ceased to bee a church of god and became the synagogue of sathan for this cause paule and barnabas shooke off the dust of their feet against them and turned to the g ils whereby we see when a church of god becommeth no church namely not so soone as they hold an heresie for the church of the galatians held iustification by workes yet thereupon ceased not to be a church but when they embrace an heresie against the foundation of religion and be conuicted of it not by priuate man but by apostolicall authority or by publick iudiciall sentence of the church from the authoritie of god word hence we may learne first what we are to thinke and iudge of the church of the papists of the libertines and anabaptists familie of loue and such like namely that they are no churches of god for they hold heresies against the foundation which the church long agone condemned by apostolicall and iudiciall authoritie againe here we learne what to iudge of this our church of england many there be that say wee haue no church among vs because some priuat man haue reprooued the same for some things that are amisse and yet they are not reformed but this is a fond and foolish reason for first the errour must be against the foundation and yet that maketh not a church to bee no church vnlesse it be obstinatly maintained after sufficient reproofe and iudiciall conuiction by the word of god but no such thing can be affirmed of vs and therfore we remaine the true church of god iii point how became the iewes a sinagogue of sathan answer through their vnbeleefe as is plainely prooued roman obiect but they held the word of god and defended the bookes of the old testament for which we are beholding vnto them answer indeed they held the letter but if we regard the true meaning of the prophets and the subiect of the old testament which is iesus christ that they raced out and denied and so though they held the letter yet worshipping god out of christ they worshipped an idoll and not that god which would giue vnto them eternal life for out of christ there is no saluation and so wee may say of the church of rome though they hold the bookes of the old and new testament with the creed of the apostles whereupon some say wee ought not to depart from them yet the truth is that indeed they hold them not the christ of the papists is but a fained christ for they take from him both his nature especially his humanitie and his offices and therefore wee haue iust cause to separat from them this example of the iewes that were once a most famous people but are now become the sinagogue of sathan must be set before our eyes continually for whe al the world were reiected they stood high in god fauour but now for their vnbeleefe they are cast off from god and are become the sinagogue of the diuell which must admonish vs not to be high minded but to feare ro for if god spared not the naturall branches them that were his first chosen people he will not spare vs that are but wild oliues graffed into the true vine we must therefore take heed of vnbeleefe and labour for true faith which we must testifie by obedience in our liues amp couersations here followeth the second part of th proposition of this epistle to wit that heauenly and spirituall counsell which christ giueth to this church of smyrna which i call counsell because in the next chapter our sauiour christ calleth such kind of instruction by the name of counsell first ere note that christ commendeth this church and giueth her counsell but doth not at all rebuke her for her faults as he did the church of ephesus hence the papists gather that god church and so the members thereof may liue without sinne and ful ill the law but they are deceiued christ therfore abstaineth from reproofe of this church not for that he had not any thing against them but for these two causes especially first because this church of smyrna did truely repent and beleeue and did not decay in grace as the church of ephesus did and therefore had the pardon of her sinnes and was in god loue and fauour secondly this church did indeuour to obey christ and to testifie her faith and loue thereby now god accepteth the desire and will of obedience in his children as obedience it selfe and therefore did not repro ue them for any fault that was among them seeing this church being in affliction is so farre forth accepted that christ reproueth nothing in her wee are taught it is profitable for god church and people sometime to bee in affliction for thereby are the gifts and graces of god preserued as faith and repentance and many greeuous sinnes preuented which otherwise god children might fall into the counsell it selfe containeth three parts a precept a prophesie and a precept againe the first precept is in these words feare none of those things which thou shalt suffer this precept may seeme to be against other places of scripture as philipp worke out your saluation in feare and trembling and rom e not high minded but feare answer there bee three kinds of feare i naturall feare ii feare proceeding from grace iii a distrustfull fearefull proceeding from vnbeleefe i the naturall feare is a declining and eschewing of death and those things that tend thereto this feare is in all man in as much as euerie thing desireth to preserue it selfe this was in christ who in his agonie feared death as it was a separation of soule and bodie asunder yet this was no sinne in him but onely an infirmitie without sinne the second kind of feare is that which commeth from grace mal if i be a maister where is mine onor if i be a father where is my feare this feare is a reuerent awe towards god in regard of his mercie and iudgements and this is a vertue and no sinne the third is distrustfull feare when man for affliction forsake religion and obedience to god standing more in feare of man than of god and this is that feare which christ in this place forbiddeth being a sin that draweth man from god vnto perdition in this commaundement christ doth two things first he giueth them and vs to vnderstand what is the sinne in which euerie man is conceiued and the seed whereof remaineth stil in the children of god namely distrustfull vnbeleefe whereby man feare the authoritie of the creature more than the glorious maiesty of the eternall god which proceedeth from this that man consider not of god as he extendeth his prouidence ouer all things and as he is a mightie iudge taking reuenge vpon all sin and wickednesse secondly here christ describeth the meanes wherby god people may arme themselues against all perils and troubles whatsoeuer to wit christian fortitude which is a gift of god proceeding fro true faith inabling a man to lay aside all feare and with courage to vndergo al dangers whatsoeuer that he may in life and death maintaine faith and a good conscience this vertue god prescribed to the prophets when they were to enter into their calling and our sauiour christ to his apostles and to this church of smyrna and it were to be wished that all the ministers of the gospell might speake vnto their people as christ speaketh vnto this church feare not but the truth is if they deale faithfully they must change their note and say with ioell ioel waile and houle ye priests and people lying in sackcloth and ashes because the day of the lord vengeance is at hand for it is lamentable to see the state of the whole body of our people of whom wee may generally say with the prophet ho there is no knowledge of god in the land and where knowledge is there is litle conscience to liue therafter consider also how the most are carnall minded dead in sin they sauour not th things that pertaine to god kingdome but their hearts are wholly possessed with earthly desires amp delights and spirituall things affect them not yes in all places wee shall see that as naturall sleepe wrappeth vp the senses of the body so a spiritual slumber benummeth their minds and hearts for though god preach daily vnto vs by his iudgements yet like the old world wee know nothing of the euill day we neuer cal to mind the iudgement to come and if herunto we ioyne the common crying sinnes of this land as swearing cursing oppression saboath breaking drunkennesse whordome and all vncleannesse yes atheisme it selfe the ground of all how can we say with christ feare not yes rather wee must call man to repentance in sackcloth and ashes for god is iealous of his glorie neither will hee alway be chiding nor winke at our iniquities he hath whet his sword and bent his bow and vnlesse wee repent the day of hauocke will come shortly wherein hee will take vengeance vpon all our iniquities and although this be the common state of our land yet christ hath his remnant among vs who mourne for the sinnes and abhominations of the times and doe endeuour to keepe faith and a good conscience in all things and to these it may be sayd feare not but take to your selues christian courage amp arme your selues therewith lay aside all distrustfull feare and glorifie god in your hearts striue to keepe the faith in a pure conscience vnto the end and so shall christ appeare to your ioy when the wicked shall be ashamed and to moue god children to this christian fortitude first let them consider what a iudgement of god is due vnto them that are distrustfully fearfull when they should suffer any thing for the name of christ revelation they must haue their reward in the lake that burneth with fire and brimstone among the damned secondly let them obserue the lord presence and his gracious promise of protection in distresse he will cause his angels to pitch their tents about them that no perill shall hurt them king when a mightie armie came against elisha his servant was fore afraid but marke how he comforteth him verse feare not saith he for they that be with vs are more than they that be with them and so it is with god children thirdly let them consider that it is a most honourable estate to suffer any thing for the name of christ and therefore the apostles reioyced exceedingly when they had bene beaten that they were counted worthie to suffer any thing for christs sake gal the crosse of christ i whole reioycing and if hee would ost of any thing it should bee herein corinthian thus were god servant affected and therefore they that repent and beleeue need not to feare what flesh can do vnto them the second part of christs counsell is his prophesie which is a prediction of that particular afflictions which this church of smirna should suffer and first he prefixeth this note of attention behold then he setteth downe the prophesie it selfe the diuell shall cast some of you into prison behold hereby he would teach vs an excellent lesson that wee must often consider before and of the day of our visitation wherein god will try v lest we perish therin our sauior christ comming towards ierusalem lu wept ouer it and when he came to it hee foretold the finall destruction of that citie which therefore came vpon them because they considered not the day of their visitation neither the things therein foretold that did concerne their peace and the like destruction wil come vpon vs in this land if we consider not the dayes of our visitation let vs therefore now in the dayes of peace forecast what is to come and prepare our selues against the day of the lord triall and so shall wee escape the fearefull and finall destruction that shall come vpon the wicked it shall come to passe that the diuell shall cast some of you into prison that ye may bee tried and yee shall haue tribulation ten dayes these words containe christs prophesie wherin he sheweth himselfe to be true god for as isay in many places sheweth it is a propertie of god alone to isa foretell a particular affliction that is contingent but some wil say others can foretel certaine things to come as the physition the sicke mans death and the astronomer the time of the eclips how then is this proper to god answer the physition foretelleth the sicke mans death onely by vertue of causes present in which the future death is to him apparant and the astronomers foretelleth the eclips by the consideration of the naturall and ordinarie course of the heauens in present and by that can come to foretell it in time to come so that simply none can foretell a thing contingent except he see it present in the causes but christ foretelleth things to come simply of himself though no cause be present as appeareth in this place in this prophesie christ describeth this affliction by sundry arguments first by the cause thereof which is the diuell secondly by the parties that were to be afflicted some of you of the church of smyrna thirdly by the kind of punishment imprisonment fourthly by the end thereof their triall and fiftly by the time of it continuance for ten dayes i argument the cause of their affliction is the diuell quest how can that be for being a spirit he cannot offer violence to mens body to cast them into prison answer true but he is the god of the world that ruleth in the hearts of the wicked he inclineth their wils to hate god children hee stirreth them vp to persecute and maketh them hi instruments to cast god servant into prison in this that the diuell causeth the affliction of god church we learne sundry points i what manner of man those be that persecute the church of god namely wicked man such as ar inspired by sathan and wholly guided in mind will and in affection by him this made paule say he was the head of all sinners because in persecuting the church of god he was guided by the diuell and made his minister which must teach vs to take heed how we persecute the church of god or any membe thereof either in word or deed for he that doth so is the vassall of sathan in that action and while he holdeth that course he sheweth himselfe to be no better than one that is wholly guided by the diuell for the diuell is the principal agent in persecutions and wicked man be his instruments ii hereby wee are taught to take pittie vpon all persecutors be they kings or monarks or whatsoeuer yes wee must pray for them though they be our enemy because they are possessed and guided by the diuell and in their persecutions do his will and become his servant and vassals iii hence wee learne with what weapons we are to defend our selues in time of persecution namely with spirituall weapons of prayers amp inuocation wherin we must shew our faith in christ our repentance amp true obedience for our principall aduersary is a spirit and hereby we shall best defend our selues against him and get the chiefest victorie elia for his prayer is called the chariot and horsemen of israell nothing doth so much preuaile in troubles and persecutions as prayer fro a penitent amp beleeuing heart and if god should send a forrain nation against vs howsoeuer the weapons of the souldier must bee vsed yet our principall weapons must bee prayer and fasting for thereby we shall soonest foyle our principal aduersary sathan who easeth not the speare nor sword and yet will flie before these spirituall weapons ii argument the parties that must be afflicted were some of the church of smyrna not all iii argument the kind of their affliction was imprisonment iv argument the end of their affliction was the triall of their faith hope loue and patience with other graces of god and the manifestation of the same first to their owne conscience and then vnto the world in these three arguments note first a speciall point touching god prouidence to wit that it is the first cause of all aboue all causes ruling and disposing them all god in gouerning the world by his prouidence vseth instruments of two sorts good or euill the good instruments are good angels and regenerat man by whome commeth no disorder for god worketh both in them and by them wicked instruments are the diuell and wicked man and though god vse them well yet from them is much disorder and sinne for he worketh not in them but onely by them permitting their sinnes and disorders that therby he may shew forth his iustice mercie and power which herein doe notably appeare in vsing these instrumets which be euill in themselues that notwithstanding their malice he causeth wonderfull order for first by his prouidence hee restraineth their furie and rage so as they cannot shew it to the full as they desire see this in the diuels persecution against this church he cannot kill the members hereof but onely cast them into prison hee cannot imprison them all but some onely neither can he keepe them in prison alwaies but for a short time secondly by his prouidence hee turneth all that they doe to the good of the church the diuell afflicteth the church for the destruction and damnation of their soules but god turneth it to their good to make their faith manifest and to preuent many sinnes in them these things wee should often thinke of and blesse god name for euer that by his prouidence he doth maister sathans power amp malice and so dispose of all actions of the wicked that they tend to the good of his church this must also teach vs to renounce our selues and to put all our trust and confidence in christ his prouidence making that our comfort our stay and protection in all distresse againe whereas the end of afflictions in god church is the trial of faith amp other graces hence we are taught many things first to labour to haue in our hearts the power of godlinesse in true faith and vnfained repentance and not to content our selues with the forme and shew thereof in a naked profession only for we must bee cast into the fie ie triall of afflictions to see what is in our hearts in the day of triall shewes will not serue the turne nor stand vs in ste d trials and afflictions will consume them as the fire doth drosse and stubble secondly to bee ioyfull and glad when the lord will is to call vs to suffer for his sake because this is a means to make knowne good graces in our hearts iames brother count it exceeding great ioy when yee fall into diverse afflictions knowing that the triall of your faith bringeth foorth patience v argument the time of their continuance in affliction is for tenne dayes by which some vnderstand a long time according vnto that which iacob sayth to laban thou hast changed my wages tenne times that is often and so the israelits are sayd to sinne numb tenne times against the lord that is many times but this exposition will not so fitly stand in this place for christ intendeth to comfort this church but what comfort could this bee to say they should bee so long in affliction others expound tenne dayes to be tenne yeares and so the word dayes is sometime vsed to betoken yeares for in the scripture there bee yeares of dayes as well as yeares of weekes but though this exposition may well stand with the words yet none can shew by true record that this church was afflicted only f tenne yeares and no longer therfore a third exposition is this that by tenne dayes is meant some short space of time and i so vnderstand this place because it is most sutable to all circumstances for here christ intendeth to comfort this church which is most fitly done by foretelling a short time of their affliction in this circumstance of time christ setteth downe two things first that the affliction of god church and people are for a certaine time decreed of god which cannot bee changed lengthened or shortened particular proofes hereof we haue in scripture so god foretold abraham that the afflictions of his people should be yeares which time they were afflicted especially in egypt but at the same night when those yeares were expired they were led out of egypt and their afflictions ceased exod and the yeares captiuitie were well knowne vnto daniell to bee determined of the lord and therefore hee armed himselfe with patience during that time and prayed not for deliuerance vntill it should bee expired the consideration hereof must moue vs to arme our selues with patience when god shall send affliction because wee cannot deliuer our selues before the time which god hath appointed for the continuance of our afflictions is set downe by god and cannot bee changed by vs secondly here christ sheweth that the afflictions of his church are but for a short time and therefore paule corinthian calleth them moment anie in regard of the eternall weight of glorie which shall be reuealed at the end of this life and neuer haue end which is a singular ground of comfort vnto the child of god in any distresse thus we see the parts of this prophesie yet in the words there is a further thing intended for euery word containeth a reason to comfort this church as first from the cause of their persecution which is the deuill and therefore they must not feare for if hee cast them into prison their case is good he is god enemie and so the lord is on their side who then can bee against them to doe them hurt secondly not all your whole church but onely some sayth christ must be afflicted thirdly sathan cannot kill you but onely cast you into prison fourthly his imprisonment shall not tend to your damnation but make for the triall of your grace and lastly it is but for a short time in all which you may see the power of god prouidence ouerruling your enemie and turning his rage vnto your saluation and therefore take comfort and courage vnto your soules lay aside all feare and al dread and keepe faith and good conscience to the end the third part of this counsell is a most blessed precept containing most heauenly aduice bee thou faithfull vnto death and i will giue thee the crowne of life god servant are called faithfull in regard of their fidelitie which they owe to god and that is in two respects i euery member of christ is baptized wherein god for his part promiseth christ with life euerlasting and the partie baptized promiseth vnto god againe that hee will denie himselfe and cast himselfe wholly vpon god in life and death and keepe faith and a good conscience which promise s called the stipulation of a good conscience pet and when a man keepeth this promise made to god then is hee faithfull and when hee breaketh it hee is vnfaithfull ii god giueth vnto his children many good gifts and graces as knowledge faith repentance and care to keepe a good conscience which he would haue them in all things to keepe and preserue and therefore paule biddeth timothie tim keepe that thing which is committed vnto him of trust now a man is faithfull vnto god when hee maketh good vse of the gifts and graces of god and still preserueth the same vsing them for god glorie and the good of his owne soule and of his brother like as we are counted faithfull with man when wee keepe that thing safe which is committed vnto vs of trust the meaning then of christ is this thou hast made a promise vnto mee in baptisme to renounce sinne and sathan and to keepe faith and a good conscience vnto death therefore performe this thy promise and for those gifts which i haue committed of trust vnto thee see thou keepe them well and vse them to my glorie in the good of thy brother against this precept three sorts of man offend and bee vnfaithfull vnto god i those that being baptized doe yet liue in ignorance and securitie neuer seeking to know god or to vnderstand his will no not so much as for their owne vow in baptisme though none will brag more of fidelitie vnto god than these man do ii those that haue knowledge and vnderstanding in god will and yet make no conscience to liue accordingly iii those that for a time shew forth many good things as care to get knowledge and to keepe faith and a good conscience but after suffer themselues to be intangled and drawne away with the profites and pleasures of the world or els to bee driuen backe by trials and persecutions and of these three sorts be most man generally whose case is fearefull and dangerous for they shall neuer haue the crowne of life if they continue thus vnfaithfull to induce man to fidelitie christ addeth a most forcible reason promising thereunto the crowne of eternall life hence the papists conclude that martyrs by suffering martyrdome doe merite the kingdome of heauen because it is called a crowne therefore say they it is a reward whereto i answere two wayes i the kingdome of heauen is called a crowne onely in resemblance because as with man after the race is run they receiue the garland euen so after man haue fought the good fight of faith and kept good conscience in this life then in the life to come they receiue the crowne of glorie for the keeping of faith amp good conscience is not the cause but the antecedent of eternall life secondly the reward is promised not to the martyrdome but to the martyr and yet not for his sufferings but because hee is a member of christ and by suffring death hath shewed his faith in christ for whose merit alone hee is so rewarded and so must this and all other promises of like sort be vnderstood for the papists do foulely erre when they apply the promises vnto the workes which are made vnto the workers by this promise wee all that haue made our vow to god in baptisme must learne to become faithfull in keeping the same vnto the end it is a shame for a man to be vnfaithfull vnto man much more with god and the more fearefull is this sinne because onely the faithfull shall inherite eternall life secondly all such as haue made a shew of good things heretofore and now doe suffer the same to decay must call to mind from whence they are fallen and become faithfull keepers of the graces of god holding fast true religion and good conscience and walke constantly in obedience and then shall they haue the crowne of life though not for their deserts but only for the merits of christ these words containe the last part of this epistle namely the conclusion wherein obserue generally as also in the two next verses that christ repeateth the same things which he spake before in this and the former chapters yes in the very same words this must bee considered because it is done by christ who is the doctor of his church whose example both for matter and manner of teaching must bee our rule and precept the like did the apostles it grieued not paule to write the same things philipp and peter sayth vnto the dispersed church pet that he will often put them in mind of the same things before his departing wherein they had knowledge and were established hereby all the ministers of the gospell in their ministerie haue warrant often to teach and repeat the same points of doctrine euen in the same words yes god faithfull minister may preach the same sermon oftentimes if hee doe it not for ease to himselfe but for the benefit of the people and therefore if any hearer of god word shall at any time marke the minister to deliuer the same things often he is not curiously to find fault with his ministerie for by that reason they may find fault with christ who seuen times repeateth the same things vnto these churches this conclusion hath two parts a commaundement and a promise the words of this commaundement haue beene expounded in the seuenth verse with the doctrines and vses thereof yet here is to bee obserued what the spirit commendeth thus seriously to our hearing the things are three which were handled in the former verses first touching god prouidence that hee seeth and regardeth the tribulations of his church the second touching triall that god church and people ought beforehand to consider of the day of visitation and thereby arme themselues with courage against all afflictions that they suffer not themselues to bee ouermuch daunted with any feare the third touching faithfulnesse god people must consider what promises they haue made to god in baptisme namely to keepe faith true religion and good conscience vnto the end and these they must performe vnto death these things being so carefully commended vnto vs by christ wee must labour to haue them engrauen in our hearts that we may practise them in our liues and to incite vs hereunto wee must marke the two reasons contained in the words first because the spirit of christ speaketh to vs secondly because they concerne all churches though principally they were spoken to the church of smyrna and therefore none may seeke excuse to exempt himselfe from learning and obeying these things the promise hee that ouercommeth shall not be hurt of the second death of the meanes of ouercomming we haue spoken in the seuenth verse by second death is meant the condemnation of the soule and bodie for euer and euer for there be two kinds of death mentioned in scripture the first is the separation of bodie and soule asunder at the end of this life the second is when soule and bodie both are s ered for euer from god comfortable presence reu this second death is expounded to bee an abode in the lake that burneth with fire and brimstone the meaning therefore of the promise is this that they which ouercome thogh they may suffer the first death yet they shall neuer suffer damnation their soule and bodie may be seuered one from the other for a time but neither soule nor bodie shall euer be seuered from god to goe into that lake that burneth with fire and brimstone which is a most gracious and happy promise here first marke to whome this promise is made namely to them that ouercome where learne that it is not sufficient for a man to professe and approoue or to teach the doctrine of the gospell but withall he must ioyne a fight against himselfe against sinne the world the deuill and against all the enemy of his saluation and not suffer them to raigne ouer him but so fight as by god grace hee may ouercome and then shall the second death neuer hurt him it is nothing to professe if we still liue in sinne and therefore wee must not content our selues with knowledge but labour to feele in our hearts such power of grace as will make vs truly to say we are conquerours ouer our spirituall enemy this is that blessed state of all those vnto whom life euerlasting belongeth who shall neuer taste of the second death secondly here is answered a great question which euery mans conscience will mooue vnto him namely how may i scape the second death that lake that burneth with fire and brimstone answer thou must in this life truely turne vnto god from all thine euill wayes renounce thy selfe and put all thine affiance in christ his death and passion and euermore labour to keepe true religion faith and good conscience vnto death in all estates this doe and though thou tast of the first yet the second death shall neuer touch thee thirdly hereby christ giueth vs to vnderstand that of the two death the second is the worser the bodily death is terrible vnto nature but the second is the proper death indeed the destruction of the creature in soule and bodie eternally and yet behold the madnesse of man who feareth greatly the first death and regardeth nothing the burning lake like vnto little children that feare their owne shaddowes and yet are not afraid of fire and water that will burne and drowne the this is mans miserable estate through the blindnesse of his mind amp the hardnesse of his heart here is the third particular commaundement which christ gaue to john whereof wee haue spoken before in the first verse shewing there what is meant by angell and why this particular commaundement was giuen vnto john this third epistle of christ as the former hath three parts a preface in this verse the proposition of the epistle verse and so forward vnto the and the conclusion in the verse i part the preface sheweth in whose name this epistle is written namely in christs name the causes whereof we haue shewed before in the first verse christ is here set foorth by an action of his kingly office borrowed from the former chapter verse these things sayth hee that hath that sharpe two edged sword that is he who is not onely priest and prophet of his church but the king thereof to guide and gouerne the same the sword which hee hath in his hand or in his mouth as isay sayth is that two edged sword yes that sharpe two edged sword thereby is signified the whole word of god the law and gospell which is so called by reason of the operation thereof as it is hebr the christ is thus described to comfort this church of pergamus for hereby three things are signified first his wonderfull power in slaying originall sinne and corruption by his word in all them that beleeue in him so as there is no hope of recouerie for sinne after it is once wounded secondly that hee will strengthen and preserue his church and all the true members thereof by the same word against all their enemy this it doth after this manner the whole word of god both law and gospell must both bee knowne and beleeued then whensoeuer any temptation commeth faith maketh the same word powerfull in vs to repell the temptation and to strengthen vs in affliction for it is that sword of the spirit whereby wee wound all our enemy but if it bee not beleeued it is but as a sword in a sheath and will nothing helpe vs thirdly hereby he signifieth that hee destroyeth all their enemy this is the chiefe end why hee so describeth himselfe in this place how christ woundeth his enemy herewith wee haue shewed in the former chapter and the sixteenth verse with the vses thereof here beginneth the second part of this epistle to wit the proposition which containeth two parts a commendation of this church in this verse and a reproofe verse the commendation is twofold first generall in these words i know thy workes then speciall in the words following i know where thou dwellest ampc of the generall commendation wee haue spoken in the former epistles verse and this yet must be obserued that christ herewith beginneth the matter of all his epistles intending no doubt hereby to settle the persuasion of his presence deepely in euery one of our hearts for it is indeed the ground of the holy feare of god which is the beginning of all true religion and godlinesse and here christ giueth a president for his ministers namely that the first thing they must teach their people is to be persuaded of this presence of christ wheresoeuer they are christ is with them and whatsoeuer they do he seeth them this will cause them make conscience of all their waies and it is impossible that any should euer haue sound knowledge or good conscience till he be persuaded hereof abraham knew well that in abimelekes court they would make no conscience of murther because they ge wanted this feare of god to feare god and keepe his commaundements is the whole man and therefore wee should giue all diligence hereunto it is indeed a hard lesson for vs to learne and of our selues wee cannot learne it but if we vse the meanes god blessing will be vpon our endeuour and then shall wee haue knowledge vpon knowledge and grace vpon grace with the comfort of a good conscience the particular commendation of this church is for her constancie in maintaining the doctrine of the gospell in these words i know where thou dwellest euen in a place where sathans throne is and yet for all that thou keepest my name that is thou holdest still my true religion and doctrine the throne of sathan is any place where superstition idolatry or profanenesse is maintained without controlement and from whence wickednesse is conueyed to other places for the diuell is the god of the world and he hath his thrones among man pergamus was a great citie of the gentiles which maintained idolatry and persecuted the gospell from whence also iniquitie was deriued to other townes and places therefore it is called the diuels throne herein we may obserue sundrie points of great importance first the exceeding pollicie of sathan he hath his kingdome in this world and for the establishing thereof he must haue his thrones where wickednesse and idolatry is maintained without controlement and whence sin is deriued to other places in all ages it hath bene thus and will continue so to the end in the old world hee had his thrones among cains posteritie in the church of the iewes euen in the daies of the kings of israell the high places and groues where the people sacrificed to their idols were the diuels thrones the oracles of the gentiles where the diuels gaue answere vnto man were his cheefe thrones in the dayes of popery euerie church and chappell were thrones of sathan wherein were erected images amp holy roods for the worship of saints whither the people came to worship from countrey to countrey in most schooles of learning for many hundred yeares the diuell had his thrones for therein was nothing taught but errors heresies and most abhominable idolatries in these our dayes the diuell hath his thrones among vs where any wizard dwelleth or cuning person as they are called for thither whole country do flocke for helpe and for counsell and so yeeld homage to sathan all dicing amp all brothel houses wherein abhominable wickednesse is freely committed are sathans thrones yes all those families are the diuels thrones where man liue without loue or practise of religion in blindnesse and ignorance in blasphemie drunkennesse whoredome iniustice or any such impieties and in reason it must needs bee thus for the diuell being a prince of this world will haue his throne in some parts thereof hereby we see it is most needfull in euerie christian kingdom there should be thrones of iustice in ciuill courts for the maintenance of equity the reward of vertue and for the repressing of iniustice and iniquitie and also thrones of ecclesiasticall iurisdiction for the reprehending and punishing of all those sinnes which the ciuill court reacheth not vnto and it is necessarie that in these thrones iustice should bee administred without partialitie that god throne may bee erected which is opposit to the throne of sathan againe the diuels cunning appeares notably in the choise of the place where he setteth vp his throne it was no petty towne or village but a chiefe and famous citie which had beene the seate of many kings this hath bene his practise in all ages to chuse the chiefest places for the seat of his throne great babylon in scripture is called a citie of iniquitie that is a throne of the diuell and rome that was once a famous church is now and hath beene long that spirituall babylon the throne of the diuell yes in ierusalem the city of the great king had the diuell got vp his throne when christ called the temple a den of theeues and in our dayes the people of great towns and cities are generally more backward in embracing the gospell than in little villages the cause hereof is the malice of the diuell who will haue his throne in chiefest places for the greater hinderance of religion there he much preuaileth by choaking the word with pride profit and pleasures causing them to content themselues with a forme of godlinesse when as they want the power thereof and thus he dealeth in greater townes that thence impietie may be deriued to the country round about as tradesmen do their wares from place to place and therefore the people of great townes especially must labour not onely to know the gospell but to beleeue and obey the same euery man must reforme himselfe and euerie familie themselues that god throne may be established amp the diuels throne battered down among them secondly whereas this church dwelleth where the diuels throne is wee may obserue whence the church of god is gathered namely out of sathans kingdome god church is a company of man ordained to saluation taken from vnder the power of the diuell though after their calling they be god peculiar flocke yet they are by nature the children of wrath thus paul speaketh of all the gentiles act and particularly of the church of colossa colos that god deliuered them from the power of darknesse and translated them into the kingdome of his deare son hence we learn i that no man is to stand vpon his his gentilitie or glory in his parentage for nobilitie and great bloud but onely reioyce in this that hee is drawne out of the kingdome of darknesse and from vnder the power of sathan and placed by christ iesus in the kingdom of grace for what will it profit a man to weare about his necke a chaine of gold if so be his heart will amp affections bee chained to the diuels seruice and what auaileth it princes to sit vpon their stately thrones if they themselues be in subiection vnto sathan and do homage vnto his throne yes what will all the treasures honors and pleasures of the world auaile to him that is debarred from the riches of god loue in christ and destitute of the treasures of his grace and so led captiue by sathan at his will and pleasure secondly some do thinke that a man may be saued by any religion the iew by his religion the turke by his and the papist by his ampc yes it is the common receiued opinion of our ignorant people that euerie one shall bee saued by his good meaning but all these are meere dotages of mens braine for a man may hold his good meaning and yet serue the diuell at his throne it is not sufficient to hold this or that religion or to practise ciuill vertues as iustice temperance ampc vnlesse a man be one of god church seuered fro the company of the that serue sathan thirdly here all god servant haue a notable meanes of stay and comfort in afflictions if they be persecuted and cast into most darke dung ons for the name of christ they must call to mind that they are taken out of the diuels prison in the kingdome of darknes and placed in the glorious kingdome of iesus christ and made members of his church and shall be inheritors of his glory fourthly hence wee learne that the preaching of the gospell hath in it a diuine power no creatures except the good angels haue power comparable to the diuels and yet the preaching of the gospell is stronger than al the power of sathan for it gathereth a church where the diuell hath his throne it deliuers man from vnder the power of sathan and placeth them in the glorious libertie of the sonnes of god although therefore it be preached by sinfull man yet it must be reuerenced as the power of god and his owne arme to saue his elect fiftly hence wee gather that god will haue his people to dwell with wicked and vngodly man for the church of pergamus dwelleth where sathans throne is this hee doth with wicked and vngodly man for good causes i that their faith obedience and repentance might be exercised and they preserued from many sins which otherwayes they should fall into moses telleth the israelits that the cananits must not be all cast out at their first entrance but dwell among them lest wild beast did grow vp which would deuour them amp so the wicked must dwell among the godly to exercise god graces in them lest they fall into sinne and securitie ii that they might shine foorth as lights vnto the wicked by their godly conuersation philipp that ye may be blameles e and pure the sonnes of god without rebuke in the middes of a naughtie and crooked nation and among whom ye shine as lights in the world holding foorth word of life and thus the godly must do that by their vnblameable life others might bee wonne to the faith for godly example is a notable meanes to draw man to loue and embrace faith and true religion pet iii that god may shew on the godly tokens of his speciall loue and fauour which he doth when hee sendeth iudgements vpon the wicked and spareth his children hence it was that when the lord would bring a common iudgement vpon the iewes he causeth those that mourned for their owne sinnes and for the abhominations of the people exe to bee marked in the forehead that they might bespared so that if any godly person dwell among such as hate religion and bee profane he must content himselfe knowing it is god will his church should be vexed and troubled by the societies of the wicked and vngodly sixtly hence it appeareth that god people may lawfully dwell among wicked and vngodly man alwayes remembring that they communicate not with them in their sins and rebellions against god for so l t dwelt in sodome and this church of pergamus where the diuell had his throne corinthian this question is answered a maister is a heathen man and his servant is conuerted to the faith whereupon hee thinketh that he is free from seruing his maister but paule telleth him he must doe externall seruice still so farre forth as he keepe good conscience and bee not constrained to renounce true religion lastly hence wee haue direction to aunswere a question much vrged against vs by the papists to wit where our church was fourescore yeares ago when luther first beganne to preach they intend hereby to proue our church to be but of fourscore yeares continuance and so our religion to be new we aunswere by the like where was the church of pergamus when the diuels throne was in that citie surely it was there where the diuell had his throne and so when antichrist that man of sin had spread popery ouer all europe at that verie same time was god church in europe where popery was professed mingled with the papists which to bee true appeareth by this that in all ages there haue bene some who openly haue oppugned popery more or lesse partly by writing and partly by speaking as the records of all ages do testifie amp make manifest so that though iniquitie had the vpper hand yet our church had his being in the middest of popery and thou keepest my name that is though thou dwell in a place where the diuell hath his throne yet thou holdest fast my name so as neither force nor fraud of the aduersarie can take my name from thee so much the words import by christs name we must vnderstand the doctrine of the gospell so paul is sayd to bee act a chosen vessell to carrie christs name among the gentiles that is to publish among them the doctrine of the gospell here this church of pergamus is particularly commended for her constancie in holding fast true religion against all aduersary power whatsoeuer hence wee learne that it is not sufficient to teach or know and beleeue the doctrine of the gospell in time of peace but we must be constant in holding it fast against all gainsayers and not be turned about with euery wind of doctrine but in life and death keepe sure the truth that neither fraud nor forc of any aduersary power draw it from vs or vs from it mat the kingdome of heauen compared to a treasure hid in the field which when a man s deth bee goeth and selleth all hee hath to buy the field the scope of that par ble is this if any man should come into any of our fields amp by searching find a gold mine he would not make it knowne to any but couer it close and go his way and sell all that he had to buy that field that thereby he might enrich himselfe euen so hauing found this that the gospell reuealeth the way to life euerlasting though we must not conceale the same from others yet we must be like this man herein that we could be content to part with all that we haue that so we might make the gospell ours tim deacons must haue this propertie to haue the ministerie of faith in a pure conscience there a good conscience is compared to a sure treasure house which cannot bee robbed by any aduersaries power and faith that is true religion is the treasure that is there safely layd vp such a store house must wee get for the preseruation of the faith any thing else we may leese but if we part with true religion saluation is gone and all is lost and therefore in life and death we must keepe fast the faith further christ amplifieth the praise of their conscience by two arguments first that they held christs name without deniall secondly that they kept the faith in the time of bloudie persecution for the first in these words and hast not denied my faith this is an excellent commendation for many will hold the doctrine of the gospell for a time and yet after deny the same by apostacie but this church held fast true religion without any reuolt at all their practise must we follow and so hold fast true religion that therein we neuer make reuolt for if wee shall once deny religion wee know not whether god will giue vs the grace of repentance that w e may professe it againe which if he do not we perish eternally consider esau example who sold his birth right for a messe of red broth and after lost the blessing which when he wold haue recouered he was reiected and found no place to repentance though be sought it with teares therfore to preuent the fearefull danger of not repenting after reuoult we must still hold fast true religion without deniall here in this place the faith of christ is all one with christs name that is with the true doctrine of the gospel and it is called christs faith first because christ with the father and the spirit is the author thereof secondly because christ reuealeth the same from the bosome of his father for god reuealeth his gospell vnto man by his son christ iesus thirdly because christ is the substance and matter of the gospell for indeed christ iesus is the principal subiect of the whole bible being the end of the law amp the substance of the gospell the second argument of their praise for conscience is taken from the circumstance of time they hold fast true religion in the time of bloudy persecution euen in those dayes saith christ when antipas my faithful martyr was slaine among you where sathan dwelleth who this antipas was is not knowne neither certainely recorded in any historie it is thought hee was the minister of this church vnto opposed himselfe against idolatry and gentilisme in this citie of pergamus in this argument note two points i that christ commends antipas calling him his faithfull martyr whereby wee see that in god church it is lawful to honor saints and martyrs for that which christ doth his church may doe this their honour must stand in two things in due deserued praise amp commendation amp in a careful imitatio of their good vertues amp godly liues and for this end doth christ comend antipas vnto this church that they might follow his good conuersation but as for popish honor of inuocation amp adoration it hath no ground in god word againe in calling him faithfull martyr hee commendeth more the cause of his death than the death to shew that the cause maketh a martyr not the death for an hereticke may be put to death for his damnable opinions therefore antipas is a martyr not because he was slain but because he was faithful vnto death for the maintenance of christs true religion ii point in the end of the verse christ sheweth who were the authors of antipas his death namely such among them in whom sathan ruled for he was slaine sayth christ among you where sathan dwelleth which words hee repenteth to giue vs to vnderstand that all persecutors let them carry what face they will are in truth such in whome the deuill ruleth where he hath his hold and keepes possession quest why did sathan more dwell there than in other places answer because many in this place were gentiles who contemned and mocked the gospell and maintained idolatry wherby they became the holds of sathan and by proportion we may gather that all contemners of religion and all that walke in their owne wicked wayes are indeed the stables and holds of the deuill though they should bee the temples of the holy ghost and so many families as there are where religion is mocked god name blasphemed iniustice and impietie practised so many holds of sathan there are where the deuill ruleth and such they continue till they reforme themselues of their impieties and embrace the gospell syncerely and therefore all masters of families especially should loue the gospell and see that in their families religion be taught embraced and obeyed that so the deuill may haue no hold in their families que whether might not antipas being pastour of this church haue fled for the safetie of his life answer there bee two kinds of persecution one that is directly intended against the pastor principally the other against the whole church equally in the persecution directed against the pastor this must bee considered whether god gaue him oportunitie and libertie to flie or not if god giue him libertie and oportunitie hee may flie and the church is to assist him and to vse means for his preseruation but if god denie him meanes to escape then he must iudge himselfe to bee called of god to suffer death for his name and so hee may not flie and such was the cause of antipas in this church but if the persecution be directed against the whole church equally then the pastor may not flie but take part in their sufferings that hee may be a meanes to stay and comfort his brother here followeth the reproofe of this church of pergamus which is first generally propounded in these words i haue a few things against thee secondly in particular for want of zeale in suffering among them such as maintained the doctrine of balam thirdly hee setteth downe a reason or confirmation thereof in the end of the verse and in the the generall reproofe is the same which was giuen out against the church of ephesus verse whereby hee would teach vs a speciall dutie namely that euery man must seriously consider with himselfe what sinnes hee hath in him which christ may haue to lay vnto his charge for this very cause doth christ rehearse it vnto this church and therefore wee must call our selues to reckoning and examine our selues not by our owne wits but by the rule of god word and search out all our thoughts words and actions and see how many things christ may haue against vs that so making a forehand reckoning and seeking to be cleared by true repentance we may not bee condemned for them at the last day for if we would iudge our selues we should not be iudged this is a necessarie dutie and the practise of it is the ground of all grace and conscionable obedience as on the other side the want hereof is the cause why many that liue in the church doe perish eternally for a day of accounts will come wherein wee shall neuer escape vnlesse by a forehand reckoning in the practise of true repentance from dead workes and by faith in christ iesus wee preuent the same lamentable and fearefull is the state of all those that neuer call themselues to this account it causeth them to goe on in sinne without remorse hos hereof ieremie complained ier that no man sayd what haue i done and for that cause hee denounceth fearefull iudgements against the people this was the sinne of the old world mat man knew nothing till the floud came and destroyed them all this securitie bringeth mens soules to hell before they wot where they are and therefore dauid crieth out psalm verse oh consider this meaning the account that god will take with them least god teare them in pieces and there bee none to deliuer them the end of preaching and hearing god word is to bring the soule to eternall life and saluation but the want of this account maketh the holy ordinance of god to bee of none effect to many a one for how should man embrace with comfort the word of reconciliation till they feele in themselues their enmitie with god and desert of condemnation ii point because thou hast them that maintaine the doctrine of balaam ampc here is the particular reproofe of this church for want of zeale in that they entertained and suffered hereticall ministers to liue among them which maintained the doctrine of balaam this shewed that though they loued the gospell and embraced it yet it was very coldly and without that feruent zeale which they ought to haue shewed against such heretickes here first christ teacheth this church to shew forth zeale in excommunicating and casting out such heretickes as by damnable doctrine did trouble them this place is a sufficient ground for the practise of that ecclesiasticall censure when man hold hereticall opinions the church after two or three admonitions is to excommunicate them and cast them out so did paule to hymaeneus and alexander tim secondly christ reprouing this church for entertaining such heretickes and wicked man doth giue vs to vnderstand that euery member of god church should haue a great dislike of all persons that hold not the doctrine of christ in truth but maintaine errours against the tenour of scripture and the profession of the church for this cause paule chargeth timothie to tim separat himselfe from such a teach otherwise than hee had giuen direct on and consent not vnto the wholesome words of our lord iesus christ and to the doctrine which is according to godlinesse being puffed vp and knowing nothing this then must be our carefull practise wee haue by god mercie true religion among vs which wee must maintaine with zeale and if any bring in other doctrine wee must reiect it and shew forth detestation to him that bringeth it not bidding him god speed john wee must rather loose our liues than suffer the truth of god to be defaced thirdly that which christ laieth to the charge of this church may in sundry respects be charged vpon our churches and congregations at this day namely want of zeale against sinne and seueritie against sinners for though the gouernours of our church repell the heresies of popery anabaptists and familie of loue and suppresse all doctrines that race the foundation which are commendable things yet in the middest of our congregations bee abundance of atheists who by deed and conuersation denie christ iesus for many know nothing in the matters of religion and moe be profane who both thinke and speake most basely of religion and of the teachers and professours thereof yes wee haue flat epicures permitted to liue in our church such as make their bellie their god who giue themselues wholly vnto eating drink sports and delights without all regard either of the generall duties of christianitie or of the particular duties of their calling wee haue also among vs many cruell and mercilesse persons that in their affaires abound in the practises of fraud wrong vsurie and oppression whose treading is vpon the poore in the pride of their couetousnesse wherby also they eate the flesh of god people and flea off their skin from them and breake their bones and chop them in pieces as for the pot and as flesh within the cauldron mich and yet all these because they submit themselues to the ciuile authoritie are permitted without controlment to be partakers of the priuiledges of god church euen to the receiuing of the seales of god couenant being themselues flat enemy to the grace of god yes many of these are greatly countenanced and graced for wisedome and reputation when as such as feare god and make conscience of their wayes are counted vile all which as it argueth exceeding want of zeale in seueritie against sinne so it cannot chuse but prouoke the lord to come against vs in iudgement as hee did against this church the meanes whereby this euill is to bee reformed doth follow afterward iii point the reason or confirmation of the former reproofe whereby the lord would mooue this church to detest these false teachers is taken from the effect of their doctrine and it is layed downe in this similitude as balaam the false prophet taught balac to put a stumbling blocke before the children of israell to cause them to eat of things sacrificed to idols and to commit fornication so this church maintained among them nicholaitans who taught it was lawful to eat things sacrificed to idols at idols feasts and to commit fornication the first part of this similitude is in the end of this verse which taught balac to put a stumbling blocke ampc the second part is in the verse touching the doctrine of balaam we are to obserue three points first what a stumbling blocke or an offence is secondly what it is to cast or put a stumbling blocke thirdly by what meanes king balac did cast a stumbling block before the children of israell for the first a stumbling block is properly any thing as wood or stone or such like that is cast in a mans way to hinder him in his gate and to cause him to trip or fall and by rese blance in this place an offence is any thing that causeth a man to sinne against god and so to slip or fall or to go out of his way that leadeth to life further an offence is twofold either giuen or taken an offence giuen is any speech or deed whereby a man is prouoked to sinne and so was peter an offence vnto christ though he tooke it not mat an offence taken is when any man taketh occasion to fall and sinne by that which is well done by others so were the pharisies offended at the sacred preaching of our sauiour christ ii point the casting or putting of a stumbling blocke or giuing an offence is the doing or saying of any thing whereby a man is occasioned to sinne and this is done either about things euill in themselues or in things indifferent things euill are such as god word forbiddeth and they are twofold either persuasions or examples bad persuasions are false doctrine and euill counsell bad example is also a giuing of offence because it doth embolden euill man in their sinne and draw the godly to euill againe in things indifferent as meate drinke apparrell ampc may offence be giuen when as they are vsed vnseasonably not in fit time and place and before fit persons and of this paule speaketh saying if i knew my eating did offend my brother i would eat no flesh while the world standeth the offence here spoken of was an offence giue in evil things for it was an euill act done by balaam and accordingly receiued and taken of the israelits for he vsed outward prouocations to allure them vnto sinne iii point the meanes whereby king balac did cast a stumbling blocke before the children of israell is set downe in the end of the verse by prouoking them to eat of things sacrificed to idols and to commit fornication that we may vnderstand this fully read numbers the summe of the historie is this when balaam had assayed sundry wayes to curse the children of israell and could not he gaue balac counsell to vse meanes to cause them to sinne at his counsell balac sent foorth the most beautifull woman in his kingdome into the campe of israell to entise them to the seruice of their idols and to banquet with them at their idoll feasts that so they might draw them to fornication whereunto the israelites condescended and so sinned against god thus much of the meaning of the words first here obserue a speciall property of false teachers namely to cast offences before man to cause them to fall in the way that leadeth to saluation by this christ intendeth to make knowne vnto this church the false doctrine of balaam paule in his epistles tim tit calleth the doctrin of the gospell a truth according to godlinesse because the intent of the gospell is to lead man to true godlinesse on the contrarie the doctrine of antichrist is called thess the mysterie of iniquitie because the scope thereof is to draw man to all iniquitie and abhomination here then wee haue a rule whereby wee may iudge betweene true doctrine and false euen by looking into the end and scope thereof if it ayme at true pietie and syncere obedience wee may iudge it to be good but if it tend to draw man to idolatry and sinne then it is a false doctrine thus wee might scan all false religions as the religion of the turke and iew at this day but because wee are more troubled with the doctrine of popery among our common people who call it the old religion therefore let vs a little examine the same by this rule the end of popery is to pull downe the kingdome of christ and to disanull his lawes as will appeare by a short view in euery commaundement and therfore it cannot bee the true religion the first commaundement teacheth vs to chuse and acknowledge the true god for our god alone but the church of rome teacheth to make more god than one amp to acknowledge the creature to be god for by their doctrine man are to pray vnto saints wherby they make them god in giuing this diuine propertie vnto them to know the heart their doctrine also ascribeth vnto saints power to merite which is a propertie of god for none can merite but he that is god the humane nature of christ ould not haue merited any thing vnlesse it had beene ioyned to the godhead yes they make the wood of the crosse to bee god for in their masse booke at this day they call not christ crucified on the crosse but the very crosse it selfe our only hope yes the virgine marie who is but a creature they place as a queene in heaue giuing her power ouer christ to commaund him in the matter of saluation and so they disanull the first commaundement the second commaundement they reuoke in teaching it to bee lawful to make images of the trinitie according as they shewed themselues in the old and new testament the father like an old man the son as hee liued and the holy ghost like a doue and therein to worship them againe they teach that man may adore the images of saints which is flat against that commaundement the third commaundement they disanull in teaching it to bee lawful to sweare by saints and not by god onely the fourth they disanull by making the feastiuall dayes of saints equall with the lord sabbath and to be kept holy vnto god as solemnly as the lord day wherby also they take away the libertie of the church in the lawful vse of the six dayes for honest labour in a mans calling the fift they disanull in giuing freedome and immunitie to their cleargie from subiection to ciuile authoritie and in dispensing with subiects for their loyaltie and allegeance to their lawful princes and with children and servant from yeelding due helpe seruice and obedience to their parents and masters the sixt by their houses of refuge which they call sanctuarie wherein murderers may be in safetie and by maintaining ignorance in religion through which they murder many a simple soule the seuenth by tollerating of stewes and allowing of incest for by their law it is lawful for the great vncle to marry his neece descending from his brother or sister so it bee without the fourth degree which is against nature the eight by making sale of all things of heauen hell of earth of pardons amp deliuering man from purgatorie which is flat robberie and most grosse deceit and cousenage the ninth they disanull by falsifying the canon of scripture for they make that canonicall which is no scripture and besides in their doctrine practicall they defend a lye for when a man hath confessed his sinnes to the priest if the magistrat aske the priest what sinnes the man confessed they teach the priest to say i know not that is say they to tell it to thee which is a flat lye and whereas they would defend this by an exposition of christs words when he sayth mat the day of iudgement is not knowne to the son of man that is say they to reueale it vnto others they doe but deceiue the simple by an exposition which is not fit the last commaundement they disanull by holding concupiscence before consent to be no sinne when as wee know by god word that the first euill motions in vs bee sinnes so that hereby wee may see that popery is but a false religion though it haue falsely among our common people the name of the old religion and therefore wee must abhorre the same as vngodly now whereas some doe charge the doctrine of our religion to bee sundry wayes scandalous they may be easily answered first they say it is a doctrine of desperation because it imports that god created man so as he will saue but a few making them for this end to cast the greatest number to hell to this i answere two things first touching the number of them that are to bee saued of which little is sayd in scripture amp therefore i will not say much yet this may be auerred the number of the elect in it selfe is reu a great company but being compared with them that shall bee damned it is but small secondly touching the end of mans creation our doctrine is not that god created me for this end to cast them to hell but this we teach that god created all man to manifest his glory in them in some by their iust and deserued damnation for sinne wee teach not that man are otherwayes condemned than for their sinnes and therefore he that is condemned hath his iust reward ii charge they say further our doctrine is a doctrine of blasphemie for that wee teach god to haue decreed the fall of man and so make god the author of mans sinne ans we teach indeed that god decreed adams fall but thence it followeth not that he is the author of mans sinne for god will is twofold generall and speciall god generall will is to permit that which is euill not simply but because with god euill hath some respect of good and in this respect wee say god decreed adams fall god speciall will is his approouing will whereby hee taketh pleasure and delight in that which is good and in this regard god nilled adams fall and mans sinnes and yet in some respect he may be sayd to will them a magistrat though he take no comfort or delight in the death and execution of a malefactour yet hee decreeth and appointeth it and so may bee sayd to will it euen so god who out of light can bring darknes permitteth euill because with him it hath some respect of good and so may be sayd to will it iii charge they say also that the doctrine of our church is a doctrine of securitie because we teach that a man may be certaine of his saluation and of perseuerance in the faith vnto the end answer this is not a doctrine of carnall securitie because we do impose necessarily the vse of meanes to them that would bee certaine of their saluation and perseuer vnto the end as namely deniall of themselues amp humbling theselues in continuall prayer with hearing amp meditating in the word of god and receiuing the sacraments for the increase of faith and renewing of their repentance all which will rather make a man fearefull and carefull than secure for with the meanes is certainty of saluation both atteined and preserued so that our doctrine is not a doctrine of offences but a true doctrine that beateth out the plaine way that eadeth vnto life secondly christ his detestation of this doctrine of balaam must admonish vs to be so carefull of our behauiour euerie way that we giue no offence vnto anie for if wee do wee are balaams schollers this is a point of speciall obseruation wee must looke to our communication that it be void of railing amp bad speeches and to our conuersation that it bee holy and vnblameable in euerie thing we must haue care not to hinder others in the way of life woe mat bee to them saith christ that giue offences it were better that a huge milstone such as an asse can but turne about as the word imports were tied about his necke and that he were cast into the sea the reason is because when a man by any means giueth his brother an offence he doth as much as in him lieth to plunge his brothers soule into the pit of destruction and therefore we must flie offences as hell it selfe yes rather on the contrary we must helpe our brother forward in the way of saluation and remooue from them all stumbling blockes that cause them to fall if this duty were practised our church would abound with grace and godlines but this duty is wanting and hence it comes that we haue so small increase after long labour in preaching for example and euill counsell do quench the graces of the spirit in mens hearts thirdly hereby wee must learne to haue speciall care against offences giuen by euill counsell or bad example for if it be the propertie of a false prophet to cast stumbling blocks before others then is it a dangerous thing to fall vpon them when they are laid before vs while we liue in this world wee shall see many offences giuen but we must take heed we take them not and therfore christ biddeth vs ma if thy foote offend thee or thine ha d cut it off or thine eye plucke it out teaching vs to forgo the dearest thing that can be vnto vs if it would cause vs to sin against god and to mooue vs hereto marke the israelits example in the wildernesse while they kept a good conscience and obserued the true worship of god all balaams curses were turned into blessings but when they fell to idolatry amp fornication with the moabitish woman then was god wrath kindled against them and his plague seized vpon them euen so if our church be carefull to keep it selfe to the true religion which by god mercie we enioy and withall haue care to keepe good conscience in becomming a penitent and obedient people vnto god then may balaam curse and al our enemy spit their venome yet we shall be safe but if we let go true religion and good conscience and fall to sinne then we must looke for ods heauie iudgements to fall vpon vs in his wrath as they did vpon his owne people fourthly when balaams cursing would not preuaile then did faire woman and banqueting draw them to idolatry and fornication hence we learne that temptations on the right hand that is taken from profit pleasures and preferments are most dangerous and soonest preuaile to draw man from god the state of a christian is like a besieged citie when a huge armie cannot sacke it than siluer and gold will open the gates hereof euen so when aduersitie cannot make a man to forsake religion amp good conscience then by prosperitie ease and pleasure hath the diuell stollen away his heart those therefore that haue ease pleasures and outward blessings at will are in a farre more dangerous case in respect of sinne than others vnlesse god vouchsafe vnto them speciall grace to watch against these pleasing temptations this made godly iob iob to sanctifie his children euerie day when they feasted each other at their houses lest any one then should haue blasphemed god in his hart because he knew the diuell by pleasures would soonest wind himselfe into their hearts lastly note the order of these sinnes first they are drawn to sit at idols feasts and then to commit adulterie where we see that these two sinnes goe together spirituall adulterie that is idolatry and bodily adultery one is the plague amp punishment of the other that people which giue themselues to idolatry will god giue vp to bodily adultery as this was true in these israeli s so is it to be seene among the turkes and with the papists at this day who maintaine fornication in tollerating stewes and further it much by their vow of single life wherewith they bind the conscience though the partie want the gift of continence here followeth the second part of the comparison where christ setteth downe two things first what the nicolaitans were secondly how hee was affected towards them what they were is expressed in the first words euen so which is a note of resemblance or comparison hauing reference to the words going before they may be thus described the nicolaitans were a se t in the church of pergamus that maintained two damnable opinios according to the doctrine of balaam i that it was lawful to eate things offered to idols in the honor of idols sitting in the idols teple i that fornication was no sin but that a man might lawfully commit it it may seeme strange that in the dayes of the apostles there should bee man professing the name of christ and yet hold such damnable opinions but the truth is hereby euident that there were such in this church and that we do not conceiue a liking of their wicked opinions let vs examine their reasons whereupon they might seeme to be grounded for the eating of things sacrificed to idols they would pleade thus i from the doctrine of christian libertie things indifferent may e lawfully vsed things offered to idols are things indifferent as meates and drinkes and therfore may lawfully be vsed ans meats and drinkes if they bee considered in themselues are things indifferent and may lawfully be vsed yes after they haue bene offered to idols if they be sold in the market they may bee lawfully bought and eaten in priuat houses if it be done without offence of the weake as paul teacheth at large corinthian but if these meats be considered as they are offered to idols and eaten in the idols temple in the honor of idols they be unlawful and yet the nicolaitans held this to be lawful ii reason an idoll is nothing corinthian and therefore we sinne not in eating meates offered vnto them ans an idoll is nothing that is in nature subsisting nothing created or ordained of god it hath no propertie of the godhead but yet an idoll is something in mans imagination which giueth to it the honour of god and reputeth it as god making it a god vnto himselfe iii reason n aman the syrian ki went into the temple of the god rimmon and there kneeled down euen so may christians go eat in idols temples ans when naaman went in thither he did not kneele downe to the idoll but to the king performing a ciuill dutie vnto his prince who vsed to leane on naamans shoulder and worship his false god and though naaman were present at idoll worship amp seruice yet it was with protestation against it for being cured of his leprosie he promised to worship no god but the god of israell and thereupon he laded two mules with the earth of the land of israell in token of his publicke profession of thankfulnesse to the true god for his clensing if these in pergamus whom christ disliketh had gone as naaman did into idoll temples they had not sinned as they did and at this day if man protest against the idolatry of the masse they may enter into those congregations where masse is said for this protestation is a flat condemning of their false worship the second opinion of these nicolaitans was that man might lawfully commit fornication this opinion they would thus iustifie first from the practise of lot who offered to the man of sodom his daughters when they called for the strangers that were come into his house which thing say they lot would neuer haue done if fornication had bene a sinne ans it seemeth that lot cannot be excused in that action though his purpose was by a less euill to preuent a greater but god hath plainely taught that no man may do the least euill for the procuring of the greatest good that can be rom ii reason the lord say they commanded hosea to take a wife of fornication and children of fornication hos it is not therfore unlawful ans there be diverse interpretations of that place some say that was onely in vision and not a fact done others say it was in speech onely because hee prophesied vnto the people that he himself was as a man of fornicatio vnto them these expositions may well stand yet others hold that the lord commanding him this it was to be done and was done indeed and sundrie circumstances seeme to prooue that it was a fact done for the womans name is set downe to be verse go er and her fathers name diblaim secondly a thing in vision or in speech onely doth not so much preuaile with wicked people as that which is done indeed thirdly the antient opinion of best diuines that liued neerest to the apostles times auouch it was a fact done obiect but this maintaineth fornication against good maners and the expresse law of god ans it were so indeed if the prophet had done it on his owne head but he did it by god speciall appointment who is lord of his owne law and may dispence with it at his pleasure god in his law forbidd th to kill yet abraham is commaunded to kill his son which if he had done he had not sinned because hee had a speciall commaundement for it which a man must obey though it bee against a morall precept againe hosea tooke a wife of fornication not to maintaine her in her sinne but to make her a chast woman and whereas he was commaunded also to take vnto him children of fornication it must not be vnderstood of children begotten by him but borne of her in fornication as if he should say take a wife with her children which she brought forth in fornication so that this place which way soeuer wee take it doth nothing maintaine their wicked errors iii reason acts the apostles charge the churches to abstaine from that which is strangled from bloud and from fornication there say they fornication is reckoned among things indifferent and therefore may be vsed lawfully answer it is there reckoned among things indifferent first because it was so accounted of amongst the gentiles secondly because the gentiles did ioyntly by these three things offend the churches of the iewes but hence it followeth not that it is indeed a thing indifferent ii point the affection of christ towards these man is noted in these words which thing i hate this hatred must bee referred not to the persons of the nicolaitans but to their opinions liues and practises hereby christ would instruct vs in sundrie needfull duties first if we will follow him wee must hate all honour and approbation that may bee giuen to idols bee it neuer so little these nicolaitans might say they abhorred idols and worshipped them not onely they went with their friends into their temples and sate downe to eate meat before them now euen this dealing christ hateth wherein hee doth notably condemne the practise of the roman church which say they worship not idols but the true god and yet they doe that which christ hateth for they kneele downe before them they adore them and light candles vnto them and offer vnto them many rich iewels and much sumptuous attire which is a great deale more than the nicolaitans did and therefore they are much more to be condemned and their practise also hated of vs secondly christs hatred of the lest honour of idols doth affoord a speciall caueat to such man as giue themselues to a trauelling life as into italy spaine and other idolatrous places they should content themselues within the precincts of the church and not proceed further without warrant of a speciall calling whereby they may assure themselues of god gracious protection for hereby they giue occasion to themselues to do that which christ hateth though they say they hate idolatry for if a man escape to bee present at their abhominable seruice yet he cannot auoid going to their temples where hee is to offer some gifts or performe some ceremonie after the custome of the country whereby hee shall giue some approbatition at the least of their idolatry whereas hee ought to hate the least appearance therof euen the garment spotted with the flesh thirdly by this his affection christ would teach vs to grow to an hatred of all familiar societie with idolaters for though we may haue society of concord with them yet societie of amitie which is a speciall liking between man amp man we must not maintaine with them fourthly christ hateth not onely their idolatry but their fornication also hereby teaching vs to grow to a hatred of fornication which the rather must bee detested because co the body of euery man and woman be not their owne but christs and therefore ought not to bee imployed in the honour or seruice of the diuell but of christ againe the body of euery christian man and woman are the members of christ now it is an vnseemely thing to take the member of christ and make it the member of an harlot fiftly their body are temples and dwelling places not for earthly princes but for the holy ghost and therefore must be furnished with god graces and adorned with chastitie amp other gifts of god spirit that they may be fit mantion places for so worthie a guest but by fornication they are made the s ies amp stables of the prince of darknesse christ hauing layd downe the sinnes of this church and the errors of the nicholaitans doth here propound vnto this church first a remedie for her recouerie secondly a reason to inforce the practise of the remedie the remedie is in these words repent thy selfe in it consider these points first what it is to repent secondly why christ so often vrgeth thereunto thirdly to whome christ prescribeth this remedie of the first we haue spoken in the first verse of this chapter briefly therefore repentance is a change of the mind from euill to good and a turning from sinne vnto god here repentance must bee taken more largely for all the duties that accompany repentance in the practise therof as i humiliation of a man by confessing of his sins vnto god and condemning of himselfe for the sinne ii prayer wherby a man doth earnestly intreat the lord for the pardon of the same sins iii reformation wherby a man in hart proposeth and in life indeuoureth to leaue all his former sinnes and for euer after to do all things in obedience vnto god vnto all these doth the holy ghost exhort them in this place ii point why doth christ so often prescribe this duty of repentance and so much vrge it an not for that it is a cause or a meritorious means to procure remission of sins amp life euerlasting as the papists do falsly and damnably teach for that nothing can do but the obedience amp passion of christ but first because it is a token of god fauor procured amp a most excellent fruit of faith such as maketh a man cease to do euill and moueth him to do good secondly because it is a way wherin me must walke vnto the end that wold haue remissio of sins amp life eternal iii point to whom is this remedie prescribed answer first to the church of pergamus and then to the nicholaitans in that church though they were most wicked man touching the church of pergamus they were before commended for most worthie graces for they had repentance and yet note christ sayth still vnto them repent thy selfe herein teaching vs a most worthie lesson which euery one ought to learne and practise namely that the life of a christian is a continuall practise of repentance when a man hath once repented that is not sufficient but euery new day must haue a new repentance for his dayly slips wee corinthian are god embassadours sayth paule for christ beseeching you in christs steed that you would be reconciled vnto god now they were reconciled to god before for they are called c p the temple of the liuing god his meaning therefore is that they should striue more and more after reconciliation with god both in regard of their further assurance and also for their particular sinnes wherein they dayly offended euery christian must dayly wres e with his owne corruptions which hee feeleth in himselfe that the longer hee liueth the more hee may grow in dislike with himselfe and in this distast of himselfe hee must dayly proceed that hee may euery day more and more grow vp in christ and least any should thinke that this was spoken to this church alone and not to vs consider that wee are in the same case with them their sinnes are our sins as we haue prooued we want zeale and seueritie against sinne and sinners now being in the same fault with them wee must therefore practise the same remedy and renew our repentance though wee haue repented heretofore secondly he prescribes this dutie to the nicolaitans that held two damnable errours and no doubt liued accordingly in those sinnes and yet christ barres them not from his kingdome but bids them repent where note that great and grieuous sinners are not barred fro god mercie if they will repent excellent is that saying of isay god i much in sparing and that of dauid also with god is plentifull redemption this point is seriously to bee considered for wee haue in our congregations many that are well spoken of in the world and yet for knowledge of god and practise of life are flat atheists we haue also among vs epicures blasphemers murtherers and fornicators with these nicolaitans now to all these and such like this doctrine appertaines not to embolden them in sinne but to assure them there is mercy in store for them with god if they will truly repent they must not turne the grace of god o wantonnesse and make his mercie a bolster to their iniquitie for this is despising of god bountie whereby they helpe vp vnto themselues wrath against the day of wrath but if with iob they humble themselues in dust and ashes and crie to heauen for mercie from a broken heart that carrieth a resolute purpose to leaue all sinne then though their sinnes were neuer so many they shall all be drowned in the bottomelesse sea of god mercie though they were as crimson and scarlet which will take no other dye yet in christs bloud they shall be made as white as wooll amp snow yes though they haue fallen often into the same sinnes which is most fearefull and dangerous yet vpon this vnfained repentance they shall bee restored to mercie for the fountaine thereof cannot be dried vp but see they doe repent for whosoeuer looketh for christs merits must know that hee looketh for true repentance thus much for the remedie ii point the reason wherby christ would set an edge vpon the former remedie containeth a twofold threatening or commination the first against the whole church in these words if not i come vnto thee shortly the second against the nicolaitans in these words and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth for the first if not i will come vnto thee shortly these words were expounded in the fift verse the meaning is this if thou repent not i will come vnto thee amp testifie my presence by taking punishment vpon thee for thy want of zeale and of seueritie against sinne and sinners to this effect the prophet isay sayth chap the name of the lord shall come from farre to take punishment vpon the assyrians in this threatening the phrase is to be noted christ sayth if not i come vnto thee expressing a thing to come by a word of the time present to giue them to vnderstand that his comming vnto them by iudgements was as certaine as if it were present vnlesse they did repent where this generall rule is to be obserued of all namely that when a church or people doe not repent the lord will come vnto them to execute his iudgements vpon them yes though they haue before repented if for particular sinnes and wants they doe not renew their repentance hee will surely come to punish them this might be proued at large by testimonies of the prophets amp apostles but it is so euident in this text that i omit all further proofe onely i will applie it to this our church of which this may bee truely sayd thou doest not repent nor renew thy repentance for thy dayly sinnes for albeit there bee some among vs that by god grace repent and set themselues dayly to the exercise thereof yet take the greater part of our congregations and they are so far from renewing their repentance that they doe not repent at all for either they haue no knowledge of god will or if they haue knowledge yet they want care and conscience to put the same in practise this being our case and condition what man may not bee a prophet against our churches and congregations being thus directed by this portion of scripture to say and that truly that god will come vnto vs in iudgments to plague and punish vs for our sinnes and iniquities wee may sooth our selues in hope of mercie still but the state of our church continuing as it is nothing can bee expected but iudgements from the lord this then must be a motiue to persuade vs to repent euery person apart and euery family amp congregation apart we must humble our selues in dust and ashes for our sinnes past entreating the lord to be reconciled vnto vs and purpose fully in our hearts and striue in our liues to obey god in all his commaundements yes though we can say wee haue repented yet for our dayly wants and sinnes wee must renew our repentance thus doing we shall stay the lord when he is comming against vs but if we goe on in blindnesse ignorance and rebellion following the lusts of our own hearts then nothing but vengeance and iudgements are to bee expected for this conclusion must stand with all churches and people if they repent not god will come in iudgement against them the second threatening or commination is directed vnto the nicolaitans in these words and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth that is i will bee at emnitie with them and testifie the same by waging battell against those among you that maintaine the lawfulnesse of eating things sacrificed to idols and of fornication thus i say will i fight against the with the sword of my mouth that is with the preaching of my word the law and the gospell in this commination christ alludeth still to the storie of balaam for when hee was sent for by balac to curse the people of god the lord stood against him in the way with a naked sword to keepe him from going and when his eyes were opened that hee saw the angell of the lord withstand him in that sort hee fell downe and adored the angell for it was the lord yet because he ceased not from his wicked couetousnesse but gaue bad counsell against the israelites when he could not curse them to cause them to sinne therefore hee was slaine with the edge of the sword among the midianites by the children of israel number euen so christ dealeth with the nicolaitans because they goe on in their bad counsel persuading the lawfulnesse of eating things sacrificed to idols amp also of fornication therfore first he will fight against them with the sword of his mouth the ministery of his word therby to reclaime them from their wicked wayes if it bee possible but if that will not serue hee will still fight against them and with the same sword destroy them for euer first here marke christ sayth not i will kill them but fight against them for hee intended not at the first to destroy these nicolaitans but his purpose was to withdraw them from their wicked wayes yet so as afterward if they would not be reclaimed by his word he would therewith destroy them wherein wee may behold the exceeding patience of christ iesus towards leaud and grieuous sinner that maintained the lawfulnesse of idolatry and fornication and gaue themselues thereunto so the lord in spirit stro e with the old world and spared them yeares to withdraw them from their wickednesse by the preaching of noe so likewise hee spared the ammonites gen till their sinnes were come to the full and the egyptians also for many hundred yeares though they were most cruell persecutors of his owne people and though the jew most maliciously crucified the lord of life yet he spared them fiftie yeares before hee cut them off from being a people yes dayly experience teacheth vs this his long suffering we may heare most bloudie and bitter oathes from blasphemers whereby they dayly crucifie christ with their tongues the like may be said of the adulterers and all cruell persons and yet he forbeares the same yes in our owne selues we dayly tast of this his patience for so soone as we were borne we deserued to be cast into hell and yet in mercie he vouchsafeth vnto vs to some twentie to some thirty and to some moe years for a time of repentance when as euery day hee might in iustice condemne vs this therefore must admonish vs in the feare of god not to abuse this his long suffering any longer but now while the day of mercie lasteth to humble our selues and turne vnto him by true repentance these are the dayes of grace but how long they will last god onely knoweth for when death once commeth he sheweth no more mercie the old world because they abused the long suffering of god pet were destroyed and are now in hell in prison for it as peter teacheth and vndoubtedly the same prison will be our portion if wee take the same course that they did secondly in this threatening we may obserue that all irrepentant sinners haue god for their enemie to fight against them with a drawn sword for this cause sinne in scripture is called rebellion and euery sinner is a rebell against god a fearefull thing it is to haue god for an enemie and yet this is the condition not onely of such as did neuer repent but of all those that hold the name of christ in profession and yet continue in any one sinne without renewing their repetance this also must serue to induce euery man that hath not repented now to begin and if they haue begun to repent more dayly renewing the same for their daily slips and so shal they be the friends of christ as iam abraham was and a his disciples were io thirdly in these two threatening christ sheweth himselfe to bee the true doctor of his church for he will fight against these nicolaitans when as hee will onely come vnto his church where wee see hee deuideth his word aright wherein consisteth the principall wisedome of a true prophet giuing comforts to whom comfort belongeth and threatning iudgements to whom iudgement is due and making difference of iudgements according to the state of the persons against whome they are threatened for the heauie iudgements of god must not be threatened against all persons but against the impenitent and because there be degrees of iudgements temporall and eternall therefore temporall iudgements must be threatened to those to whom they belong amp eternall iudgements denounced against those to whom they belong obseruing the circumstances of time place and persons according to christs example in this place and else where so likewise the benefites of the gospell are not to bee propounded to euery person hand ouer head without difference but with restraint to some onely as god prophets haue done it is often a great offence in the church when the benefits of the gospell are propounded to all and the threatening of the law denounced against all without limitation or restraint the conditions therefore of repentance amp impenitencie of faith and vnbeleefe and also the degrees of them all must carefully bee obserued in the dispensation of the law and the gospell fourthly the end of christs fighting must be considered for first hee intends to reclaime them from their euill wayes but if they will not be reclaimed then to cause the same word to be an occasion of their deeper condemnation this must be deepely weighed of vs all who haue had by god mercie for many yeares the plentifull preaching of the gospell by which god hath continually rebuked amp checked the sinnes that bee among vs as ignorance blaspemie and filthinesse crueltie and all iniquities whatsoeuer and the same thing the lord yet continues to doe vnto vs wee therefore must thinke that all this while the lord is fighting against vs when ignorance is reprooued in the ministerie of the word the ignorant person must thinke the lord is fighting against him and so all atheists blasphemers adulterers oppressers and cruell persons when their sinnes are reprooued they must know that the lord stands face to face against them with the sword of his mouth seeking to reclaime them from these iniquities as hee did to balaam in his way and when any mans sinnes be thus touched hee must not rebell but humble himselfe as balaam fell before the angell considering it is the lord that wageth battell against him when wee heare that foreign nation shake their swords against vs how are wee mooued both high and low shall wee feare the sword of mortall man and shall we not tremble when we heare that the sword of the euerliuing god is shaken against vs those therefore whose hearts are guiltie of any one sinne must humble themselues by true and speedie repentance there is no withstanding of the lord if his sword doe not cure vs it will cut vs in pieces if his word doe not conuert vs from our sinnes it will bee an occasion to cast our soules deeper into hell thus he dealt with balaam when he would not be restrained from giuing bad counsell he was slaine among the midianites few thinke on these things from whence commeth such great contempt of god ordinance in the ministerie of the word as we see at this day but they must know that either death or life come by the stroke of this sword and therfore they must repent fiftly note the title giuen to god word it is called the sword of christs mouth not onely because it was once deliuered by himselfe from his own mouth but because it doth dayly proceed from his mouth for the ministers of the gospell which bee truely called are the very mouth of christ from which god people receiue his word ie if thou shalt returne sayth the lord to ieremie and shalt separate the precious from the vile then shalt thou stand before me and be according to my word corinthian wee are the embassadors of christ beseeching you in his steed which is an high and wonderfull honour the consideration whereof is a ground of sundry duties first all students that are in the way of preparation to higher callings must hereby learne to conceiue a good opinion of the ministerie of the gospell and to affect the same aboue other callings for though the blind world count it a base calling yet christ wee see maketh the minister his owne mouth which honour is not giuen either to the lawyer or to the physition secondly hereby euery minister of the gospell is taught to deliuer nothing in his publicke ministerie but the pure word of god so farre foorth as christ shall enable him and that also in so pure a manner as in the persuasion of his owne conscience hee thinkes christ would speake if he were there present like vnto faithfull embassadours who speake onely the will of their lord and prince and in that manner which their lord and prince doth best approoue if this were well weighed wee should not haue such preaching as is commonly vsed consisting of a mixture of testimonies partly diuine and partly humane considering that neither christ nor his apostles preached so thirdly the people also are hence taught their dutie when they heare a sinfull man like vnto themselues speake vnto them in the ministerie of the word they must not despise god ordinance because it is deliuered by man but receiue the same as from the mouth of christ and as the pure word of god so far forth as it consenteth with holy scripture in this behalfe paule blessed god for the thessalonians that they receiued the word from him not as the word of man but as it is indeed the word of god thess verse sixtly where christ sayth i will fight against them with the sword of my mouth we may obserue that the kingdom of christ is spirituall and not of this world for if it were worldly then a ciuile sword wielded by the hand of man should belong vnto him but he hath no such sword he gouernes his church and people by the sword of his mouth his holy word wherby appeareth that the primacie of the sea of rome is from hell not from heauen for the pope sayth he is christs vicar and yet he will be armed with both swords when as christ dealeth not with the ciuill sword but onely vseth the sword of his mouth these words are the conclusion of this epistle which containeth two parts a commaundement and a promise the commaundement in these words let him that hath an eare heare what the spirit saith vnto the churches the promise in the words following to him that ouercommeth ampc the commandement serueth to stir vp god church to attention in marking that which christ deliuereth vnto them as hath bene shewed before verse in this commaundement of christ note two things first that all man in god church are bound in conscience to frequent sermons whereby they may come to the knowledge of those things that god prescribeth vnto them at the natiuitie easter and such good times as they are called ignorant people will come to the church but it may bee not once more of a moneth after or a quarter of a yeare but christ saith ioh my sheepe heare my voyce so that hee that will not come to heare the voyce of christ is none of his sheepe math christ saith to peter i will giue thee the keyes of the kingdome of heauen there the preaching of the gospell is the key of the kingdom of heauen so that looke how necessary it is for a man to haue his soule saued and to enter into heauen so behoouefull is it for him to heare sermons for that is the turning of the key whereby we enter into this kingdome corinthian the preaching of the gospell is the doctrine of reconciliation and therefore looke how necessary it is for a man to be reconciled to god so needfull is it for him to heare the word preached he that is of god beareth god word and he that beareth it not is not of god john but man haue manie excuses to exempt themselues from hearing sermons some say if god himselfe would preach or christ or an angel from heauen then they would heare but so long as sinfull man preacheth it is no great matter though they absent theselues answer this is a presumptuous reason for the preaching of the gospell by man is god owne ordinance and that for these causes first since adams fall man cannot abide the voyce of god so as if man should heare god speake he would cry out with the iewes exod let not god talke with vs lest we die and with peter luke depart from me i am a miserable sinner secondly god speaketh by man to trie the obedience and humilitie of man to see whether they would bee content to receiue and beleeue his word being propounded by sinfull man that is like vnto themselues and thirdly to maintaine loue betweene man and man by mutuall conuersing in this holy ordinance others doe say they may well inough keepe themselues in their families for there they haue their bible wherein bee the sermons of christ and of his prophets and apostles than which no minister can preach better ans it is god ordinance that these sermons of christ of the prophets and apostles should be againe handled preached and expounded in his church and therefore euerie man is bound in conscience to come into the congregations amp there to heare with reuerece god holy word others will not come to the church for they thanke god they can serue god with as good a heart on horse backe or on their iourneys as those that come vnto the sermons answer these persons are blind and ignorant a seduced heart beguileth them and therefore they despise the ordinace of god but let them heare what salomon saith pro he that turneth away his eare from hearing the law that is the doctrine of god euen his prayer shall be abhominable god speaketh vnto vs in the ministerie of his word and if wee refuse to heare him there shall we thinke hee will heare vs when wee pray know therefore if thou refuse his word hee will refuse thy prayers neither indeed can any without the word pray aright such people deceiue themselues their prayers in their needlesse iourneyes shall bee their iudges to condemne them for therein they confesse god is to bee worshipped and yet in practise they reiect his direction for the same lastly others say they haue knowledge inough the ministers can teach them no more than they know and therefore they need not go heare so much preaching answer these that pretend such perfect knowledge are commonly the most ignorant not knowing the end of this ordinance of god for preaching serueth not only to teach man to know god and his will but also to increase in knowledge and to yeeld obedience to that which they know if therefore thou hast knowledge it is well but that is not inough if thou wouldest be blessed thou must doe that which thou knowest john and for this cause the most learned man that is must still frequent the hearing of sermons to further himselfe in obedience because a man may know much and yet want conscience to obey secondly in this commandement man are inioyned the reading of the word amp hearing of it read not onely publickly but also priuatly in their families that therby also they may come to the knowledge of that thing which christ propoundeth vnto them luke christ saith to one of the scribes what is written how readest thou taking it for granted that man must read the scripture priuatly and the lord saith isay my people go into captiuitie because they haue no knowledge yes they perish hose but wofull is the defect of this duty for many haue not the bible in their houses for their priuat exercise in the word and in many families it is set vp for a shew or lieth couered with dust when as cards and tables are worne with vse it is not amisse for man to get the statutes of the land into their houses and to read therein for the knowledge of mens lawes but yet herein they are blame worthie that either they haue not or else regard not the booke of god whereby they might bee acquainted with the statutes of the lord for the better guiding of our vnruly affections other things in this commandement haue beene obserued before the second part of this conclusion is an excellent promise made to him that ouercommeth which for substance hath beene handled in the conclusions of the former epistles here onely some speciall blessings are particularly promised in the handling whereof two points are to bee considered first the persons to whom the promise is made to him that ouercommeth whereof entreatie was made before verse secondly the blessings promised comprised in this threefold gift of god first to eate of the mannah which is hid secondly to receiue a white stone thirdly a new name written in the stone all which three signifie in effect the election vocation iustification and glorification of god people but i wil handle them in particular the i benefit is the giuing of the hidden manna to eate manna properly signifieth that food which god gaue from the clouds to the people of israell which for the excellencie of it is called the psalm wheate of heauen the verse food of the strong o the food of angels in forme it was like exod coriander seed and in colour white in tast it was pleasant and sweete herewith god fed his people in the wildernesse years to deu teach them that man liueth not by bread only but by euerie word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god this is thought to bee the same white manna which is vsed in shops at this day but i will not dispute thereof seeing it is doubtfull that manna did represent a more excellent food and therefore paul calleth it co a spirituall meat because it represented vnto them the spirituall food of the soule christ iesus the true manna iob the liuing bread that came downe from heauen as wee may see at large john and so in this place by manna wee must not vnderstand the manna of the people of israel but christ himselfe the true food of life eternall how christ doth become vnto vs our spirituall manna and the true food of life i will shew by these conclusions i he is this food not in regard of his doctrine or of his miracles nor yet onely in regard of the blessings of his death and passion but christ himselfe god and man is true food of life as is shewed at large john and in christ himselfe are his death and passion amp the benefits thereof food vnto the soule ii conclus christ is this food not as he lay in the manger or as he now sitteth in heauen at the right hand of his father but as he suffered the wrath of god and pangs of hell vpon the crosse and as he died amp was buried for our life commeth out of christs death iii concl he is this food not in regard of his godhead for that no creature can receiue or apply to his iustificatio or sanctification but in regard of his manhood subsisting in the person of the son of god christs flesh profiteth nothing seuered from the godhead but yet his body and bloud haue this vertue to be true spirituall food because they are the flesh and bloud of that person which is god iv concl christ is not a bodily food to be receiued with the had eaten with the mouth amp digested in the stomacke but he is a spirituall food to be receiued applied amp digested by faith and being so receiued he doth preserue the soule vnto eternall life this faith is that wherby a man is enabled to beleeue that christ crucified is his christ and thus doth he become our spirituall mannah when by true faith wee assure our selues that he suffered for our sinnes and rose againe for our righteousnesse is christ crucified the true bread of life and our spirituall manna then should we long after him with a true spirituall hunger in our very hearts as truly as any man longeth after meat amp drinke when a man is famished for the staying of his hunger he will pull his owne flesh from his bones and eat it euen so for the satisfying of our hungrie soules with christ iesus this food of life we must forsake the deerest thing in all the world though it bee our owne flesh for that which we will do for our body we must do much more for our soules que how shall we attaine to this true spirituall hunger answer it is with the hunger of the soule as it is with the hunger of the body in bodily hunger bee two things a great paine in the stomacke for want of nourishment and a strong and earnest appetite which continueth till the stomacke be filled euen so we should feele a paine in our hearts rising from a sense of the wrath of god for our sinnes and then wee must labour to haue a greedie appetite and earnest desire to bee filled with christ crucified amp neuer be at rest til we be satiat with the merit of his passion which only can free vs from god wrath and fill vs with true ioy but wofull bee these times for there is in most mens hearts a deadnesse of spirit whereby they are made insensible of inward wants and miseries they are like vnto full man that feele no paine for want of food there is indeed an hunger nay a greedie worme in many after the profit pleasures and honors of this world but few or none do hunger after christ but if wee would haue reu part in the feast of the lambe we must labour to haue this longing appetite after christ if we be full stomacked wee shall haue no refreshing from his merits mary saith truly in her song luke god filleth the hungrie with good things but the rich and full goe away emptie which is a most fearfull curse when the soule is debarred from this food of life but mat blessed are we if we hunger after christ and his righteousnesse for then we shall bee satisfied christ will giue vnto vs our fill of the water of life freely revelation secondly here we may take a view of the profane madnesse of the world for though this bread of life christ iesus be the most excellent food of all farre surpassing the israelits manna the food of angels yet it is nothing or little desired man are like to the foolish israelits that had more regard to leekes and onions and to the flesh pots of egypt than to angels food which god gaue them fro heauen they spend their wits and their strength by day and by night that they may satiate themselues with the fraile riches and vaine pleasures of the world and yet these man haue the name to be the onely man whereas indeed they are profane esau amp wicked israelits as therefore this practise is damnable so must we learne to detest it and on the contrarie seeing christ iesus is the true manna our principall care and desire must bee to bee fed therewith wee must thinke it is a great disgrace to christ iesus which hee cannot endure without reuenge that wee should haue lesse regard to him the true bread of life than to earthly foode which perisheth thirdly here wee may see that which is vsuall in the scripture intreating of the sacraments to wit the name of the signe giuen to the thing signified for christ here promiseth them manna meaning thereby not the israelits food but himselfe whereof their manna was a signe a seale a pledge as appeareth plaine because paul calleth it spiritual meat corinthian further christ is not only called manna but hidden manna to put a difference betweene himselfe and the manna of the israelits which was visible that euery man might see and christ is called hidden manna for two causes first because no man by nature knoweth this food or desireth it secondly because god doth not reueale this food to al man effectually as may appeare mat i giue thee thankes oh father that thou hast hidden these things that is the doctrine of the gospell and the mysteries of the kingdome of heauen from the great and wise man of the world and hast opened them vnto babes is christ hidden mannah then first here learne to take knowledge of the state of man in the world they know not christ neither do they feele in themselues any want of this food and therefore they know not what it meaneth for meat and drinke is neuer knowne till a man be hungrie yes to many that liue in the church this manna is hidden for though man heare the doctrine of christ yet not one of an hundred feele in themselues any want of christ let the conscience speake and this will prooue true ignorant people blesse themselues and say all is well christ is a sauiour when as indeed to them christ is hidden nay which is yet more lamentable to many which teach and preach christ christ is hidden manna for many of them neuer felt in their hearts and conscience that they had need of christ for the pardon of their sinnes and the saluation of their soules it is not the knowledge in the brain that maketh christ known to man but knowledge in the coscience when a man feeles in his heart and soule that hee stands in need of the bloud of christ and all the benefits of his passion for his redemption amp saluation and seeing this is the condition of the world wee on the contrarie must labor to feele in our selues our owne pouertie amp to see in our selues that we stand in need of christ and of all the benefits of his passio to free our soul from the gulfe of hell and the wrath of god away with bare mentall knowledge for till we haue this true sense of our owne wants wee can neuer get into our hearts any sound grace secondly is christs hidden bread not reuealed to all then calling effectuall to saluation so as if hee will euery man may be saued is not vniuersall for then should christ not be hidden but reuealed to all which is not so election therefore and effectuall vocation is definite amp particular and thus much of the first branch of this gift the second gift is a white stone here christ borroweth a comparison from the custome and manner of the gentiles to whom these epistles are directed a white stone was of great vse among the for first the iudge in giuing sentence vsed white stones and blacke stones the giuing of a white stone was a token of absolution the giuing of a blacke stone a signe of condemnation here then the giuing of a white stone may signifie absolution from christ of all a mans sins and trespasses againe when the gentiles would know which were luckie dayes as they spake and which were vnluckie they vsed to cast lots with white and blacke stones and that day which light on a white stone was iudged to be a lucky day that which light on a blacke stone was iudged to be vnlucky this practise they vsed as might be shewed by sufficient records and though this practise haue no warrant yet may christ allude vnto it to signifie vnto them that hee will giue them good successe in all their actions yes happie dayes and a blessed life full of all ioyes and pleasures others doe expound it of giuing victorie whereof the giuing of a white stone was a signe but this is not so fit neither can it bee shewed by true record that they had such a practise i rather take it christ alludeth to the first and here promiseth to him that ouercommeth the true remission of all his sinnes and full absolution not in regard of ciuill punishment but in respect of guilt and punishment before god which is eternall damnation here note one infallible token of the pardon of sinne namely to ouercome that is to renounce our selues and by faith relie wholly on christ testifying this faith by maintaining good conscience and true religion vnto the end and therefore if anie desire to know whether god haue absolued him of his sinnes let him labour thus to ouercome and then shall this assurance be sealed vp vnto him the third gift is a new name written in the stone what this new name should be s john expresseth in his first epistle chapter verse saying behold what loue the father hath shewed to vs that we should be called the sonnes of god this new name therefore is to bee the son and heire of god in christ and because it is giuen of god himselfe therefore wee must not thinke it is an idle name or a bare title onely but withall god giueth him a new condition whereof this name is a token and title god changed abrams name amp called him abraham but it was when he had changed his estate and made him the father of the faithfull and there was a change in iacob when god called him israell this new name then signifieth the giuing of a new estate to a man or woma which they had not before namely their regeneration whereby they are made to die vnto sinne and to liue vnto god for therewith goeth the blessing of adoption whereby they become the sonnes of god and heires with christ and so haue heauen and earth for their possession and all miseries and crosses yes sinne it selfe turning to their good they haue also the protection of god holy angels in this life and at the last gaspe death to bee no death but a strait passage to eternall life further this new name is sayd to bee written in the white stone that is in the pledge of absolution which sheweth the vnion of these two absolution and regeneration so that whom the lord of his mercie absolues from their sinnes them in his bountie hee brings to a new estate and condition he that is in christ is a new creature corinthian a point to be obserued as yeelding speciall aduice to reforme the grosse and common abuse of christ man persuade themselues that christ is their sauiour and will pardon their sinnes for he is mercifull and thereupon they take occasion to liue as they list but let no man herewith deceiue himselfe for they that haue absolution haue regeneration also a new condition of life goes with the fruition of god mercie in christ they that go on in sinne haue not the pardon of sinne the corruption of sinne must bee abolished where the guilt of sinne is absolued and their liues are reformed that haue their sinnes remitted here some man may say why are not those called by this new name to whom christ giues it for vsually man are called after their names the answere is made in the end of the verse because no man knoweth that name saue he that receiueth it that is in that manner and certainetie as hee that receiueth it and therefore the children of god must not be much offended when they are reuiled for their profession because the world knowes not their estate here we may obserue diverse points first that hee which is the child of god and hath this new name giue him knows that hee is god child iustified and sanctified neither is this knowledge by probable coniecture onely and good hope as the papists would haue it but certaine and infallible for else others should know it as well as hee that receiueth it which is here denied each one is bound in charitie to bee persuaded that godly professors are the son and daughters of god but the man himselfe that hath receiued this new name and new estate hee knowes it otherwise and therefore certainely and infallibly secondly if no man know this name but hee that receiueth it then can none beside god and the conscience know from within the man his particular faith and adoption and hereby we are to bee admonished to beware of charging the euill and hard censure of hypocrisie vpon any that liue in the church in so doing we ouershoot our selues this iudgement belongs to god not to man saue onely to the man himselfe for wee cannot discerne the good within the man properly but by effects quest how farre forth may a man iudge of another mans election answer there be two degrees of iudgement iudgement of certentie and iudgement of charitie iudgement of certentie is when a man can set downe certainely such a man shall be saued this is peremptorie iudgement belonging vnto god and to some man onely so farre forth as the lord reuealeth it vnto them as he did the estate of some man to dauid and to some prophets whereupon dauid sometimes prayes for the finall destruction of his enemy but this is not giuen ordinarily no not to god ministers the iudgement of charity is that which bind a man to iudge the best of another and herein bee two degrees first touching the vnregenerate charitie binds vs not to despaire of such as yet liue profanely but to hope that god will in good time call them and touching the regenerate who haue giue good testimonies of their vocation charitie binds vs to be persuaded without doubt that they be the children of god and this we may doe without repugnance to this place for though wee cannot from within the man know his estate yet by the fruits we may which is the highest degree of iudgement that charitie can exercise thirdly here wee see the church of rome is deceiued who make visibilitie the marke of god church for god church is a company of man which beleeue the ground of the church is god election and adoption and mans faith which none other can see but the parties that haue them the signes thereof may be seene but properly the church cannot bee seene it comes to bee visible by the fruits of election and by the outward works of loue which proceed from faith we therefore hold farre better that wee beleeue there is a church and not that we see the church lastly if others know not the name of god children then what maruell is it if the wicked miscall them john the world knowes vs not god children therefore must not be daunted at the reproches of the wicked but pray with christ father forgiue them they know not what they doe luke here followeth the fourth particular commaundement of christ vnto john as also the fourth particular epistle the commaundement in these words to the angell which is at thyatira write of the substance of this commaundement i haue spoken before onely remember the end thereof which is to certifie this church of thyatira that john had a calling and commaundement from god to write this epistle vnto them and further to certifie the whole church of god to the end of the world of his calling to write this booke of the reuelation the epistle it selfe containeth three parts a preface a proposition and a conclusion the preface in these words these things sayth the son of god which hath his eyes like vnto a flame of fire and his feete like fine brasse all which things almost haue beene handled in the beginning of this chapter and in the former from whence they are borrowed in the preface first is set downe in whose name the epistle is written to wit in christs name the causes thereof we haue shewed before then christ is described by three arguments first to be the son of god secondly to haue eyes like a flame of fire thirdly to haue feete like fine brasse for the first in the former chapter he was called the son of man but here he is called the son of god where by god wee must not absolutely vnderstand the godhead of the whole trinitie but the person of the father who being opposed either to the son or to the holy ghost is vsually called god not that he is god more than the son or than the holy ghost but because he is the first in order and because hee is that person from whom the godhead is communicated to the son and to the holy ghost so that here christ is called the son of the father which mysterie wee cannot fully vnderstand for the word hath not reuealed the same neither can wee find it elsewhere out of the word but yet for the better conceiuing thereof remember these two rules i that christ is the son of the father not in respect of his godhead but in respect of his person for the godhead of the son is the same with the godhead of the father the godhead of the father doth not beget neither is the godhead of the son begotten ii rule christ is the son of the father not by creation as the angels and adam were nor by adoption as euery beleeuer is but by nature in that hee is begotten of the substance of his father before all worlds for the father communicates from himselfe the whole godhead that is in himselfe vnto his son christ is here called the son of god to stirre vp reuerence attention and care in this church in marking and obeying the things that follow in this particular epistle and in their example christ also teacheth vs that when we heare the word of god preached or read vnto vs wee should receiue it with fear and trembling and reuerence because he that speaketh vnto vs out of his word is the son of god when pilate was about to condemne our sauiour christ he heard it said that christ was the son of god and thereupon hee trembled and was the more afraid ioh verse shall a illie heathen man that knowes not christ tremble towards him when hee heares his name and yet wee that professe our selues to beleeue in him bee nothing mooued with reuerence towards him when hee speakes vnto vs in his word at his presence the hils melt and at his voyce the rockes cleaue in sunder and therefore if our hearts shall not melt and cleaue asunder with a reuerent feare when he shall speake vnto vs wee are worser than these sencelesse creatures secondly christ is sayd to haue eyes like a flame of fire which we must not conceiue literally the words are borrowed from the former chapter verse where christ is described not as hee is in truth but as he appeared to john in vision we haue shewed before what is signified by these fierie eyes namely christs infinite wisedome in himselfe and vigilant zeale ouer his church the end wherefore hee so describeth himselfe to this church is to giue them to vnderstand that hee can see and discerne their very secret sinnes for sundry among them were giuen to priuate offences as to fornication and idolatry as we shall see afterward here then wee haue an excellent remedie against secret sinnes shame and feare of punishment will restraine some man from open sinnes but yet the same man when they are in secret doe without fear commit priuie sinnes against the first and second table but these man must remember that being withdrawne from the presence of man they are yet in the presence of christ for hee hath fierie eyes wherewith he seeth their most secret sinnes which they hide from the world for though we may make faire weather with man yet wee can neuer bleare the eyes of christ if fornicators wantons vsurers and blasphemers would remember this by god grace it would bee a notable meanes at least to restraine them from their secret sinnes if not to mooue them vnto the practise of true repentance thirdly christ is sayd to haue feete like fine brasse whereby is signified as hath beene shewed his infinit power and strength whereby he doth subdue sinne sathan and al his enemy first vnto himselfe and then vnto his members and christ is thus described vnto this church to terrifie certaine wicked man among them that gaue themselues to fornication idolatry and other sinnes as also to affright this whole church who by their wicked company were almost drawne away to the same sinnes here wee haue a notable remedie against loosenesse of life namely to consider that christ whom we call our sauiour walketh continually in his church with feet of brasse to tread sathan and all his enemy vnder his feet and such are all that will not submit themselues to the regiment of his word luke if the blasphemer could consider this it would stop his mouth and when the adulterer the theefe or any sinner goeth about his wicked deuices this by god grace would be a notable means to make him breake off his wicked purpose when benhadad heard that the king of israel would come against him in battell king he sent his man with ropes about their necks to craue peace and in them humbled himselfe shall man be thus afraid at the furie of man and shall not wee tremble and feare at the fury of christ who hath these feet of brasse to trample in pieces all his enemy the want of this consideration is one maine cause why sinne doth abound here begins the second part of this epistle to wit the proposition which containeth the substance amp matter thereof and it hath two parts a commendation of this church and a rebuke thereof the commendation in the verse the rebuke or dispraise in the verse and those that follow almost to the end of the chapter the commendation is twofold generall in these words i know thy workes this hath beene handled before verse the particular commendation standeth in fiue notable workes to wit loue seruice faith patience and encrease in godlinesse for the first by loue wee must vnderstand loue to man for afterward they are comended for duties to god in faith and patience but loue and seruice are duties of man to man touching loue note three points what this loue is what is the propertie of this loue and how it is to be practised first loue to man is a gift of the spirit of god whereby a man is well affected to his neighbour for god sake that loue is a gift of the spirit is plaine galat verse where it is reckoned among the gifts of the spirit next i adde that hereby a man is well affected to his neighbour to bee well affected to another is to reioyce at his good and to desire and seeke the same and withall to bee grieued at his miserie and to eare the bowels of compassion towards him being readie to releeue and helpe him to our vttermost by neighbour wee must not vnderstand only those that are neere vnto vs in habitation but euen all those that are of the same nature with vs euen any of mankind hee is thy neighbour that is a man as thou article and so bearing the image of god as thou doest bee hee friend or foe neere or stranger vnto thee and to him must thou be well affected lastly i say for god sake for god is first and principally to bee loued for himselfe and man in god and for god because hee is the creature of god and beareth his image the loue we beare to man is a fruit of our loue vnto god for this commaundement wee haue of him that he that loueth god should loue his brother also john ii point the propertie of this loue is to be feruent and that for two causes first if need require euery man is bound within his calling to testifie his loue ioh by giuing his life for his neighbour though he be our enemie or a stranger which wee shall neuer doe vnlesse our loue be feruent secondly there is much ingratitude hatred emulation and many iniuries in the world now the persons from whom these come must be loued the vnworthinesse of the partie must not quench our loue but it must burne when the water of mens iniuries and malice would quench the same iii point the practise of our loue must be squared by this rule the loue of our selues as wee wish our owne good heartely so we must wish our neighbours good this is the law of nature to doe as a man would be done vnto and it is the law of god thou shalt loue thy neighbour as thy selfe example a man of some trade is to make a bargaine and if hee will lye or vse false weights and measures he may aduantage himselfe this the deuill and his owne corruption will suggest vnto him while hee is about the bargaine he therefore must call to mind this rule of loue and examine his owne heart whether hee would haue another man to deceiue him by lying by false weights ampc the same thing must man doe when they are tempted to oppression or crueltie let them thinke whether they would haue others to wrong or oppresse them and so shew forth loue by this rule doing as they would bee done vnto it were to bee wished that our church might haue the deserued prayse of this vertue of loue but christ foretold of these our dayes that loue should waxe cold matth and tim that man should be louers of themselues and so it is for euery man now is for himselfe no man seekes anothers good goe through townes markets and fayres and rare it is to find a man that in his affaires seeketh the common good as well as his owne for this is the common rule may i not make of mine owne what i will but he that hath the grace of loue seeketh not his owne onely but the good of others also corinthian here then wee must learne to practise this vertue that wee may haue christs commendations with this church euery man in the generall calling of a christian will make great shew of loue as when he comes to the lord table amp in praier but in their particular affaires few shew forth true loue nay many by lying oppression crueltie flea the skinne from the flesh and the flesh from the bone of the poore and breake the bones within the flesh and chop them as for the pot as the prophet speaketh these little consider this rule or that account which the lord will take of them who hath sworne neuer to forget these works amos learne therefore in thy particular calling to shew forth loue and imploy thy commodity not for thy selfe alone but for the good of those with whom thou liuest herein is loue and hereby shalt thou be known to be the servant of christ john and the child of god translated from death to life john verse the secod thing for which this church is comended is seruice to omit the diverse significations of the word here it betokeneth a worke of loue whereby a man within the compasse of his calling becomes a servant vnto euerie man for that mans good read heb where this is both commended and described gal do seruice one to another in loue corinthian loue seeketh not her owne but maketh her selfe servant to all to do them good and christs commaundement is let him that would be chiefe among you bee as the servant luke now the principall part of this seruice is when a man is readie with h s goods according to his abilitie to helpe the poore especially those that be godly this is a fruit of loue and therefore it is here set after it as also in the places before named hebr verse gal it were to be wished that our church and people might haue the like praise for this vertue but the richer sort spend their substance and wealth vpon haukes and hounds buls and beares vpon costly attire and banqueting so as when the poore that are in need come for releefe they haue nothing to spare and if any thing bee giuen it is drawne as hardly from them as a ribbe out of their side man wil giue frankly to delight themselues with playes and pastimes and such like vanities but the poore that be their owne flesh may die in the streetes for want of that which man giue to their dogges but if we respect the commendation of christ iesus let vs abandon these vanities which hinder vs in the practise of this vertue of seruice for the good of our brother and to induce all man hereto let them consider i how the church of the old testament was charged with giuing the first fruites of their wine corne and oyle and likewise with many sacrifices and ceremonies which belonged to the temple these things indeed be ceased and yet wee may not mispend these good which hereby are spared for in the new testament the poore are in steed of the altar and they must haue that which the altar had among the iewes againe isay he that powreth foorth his soule to the hungrie that is he that seeing the poore in miserie hath the bowels of compassion mooued towards them and from his pitifull hart releeueth their wants according to his abilitie his light shall neuer bee put out but shall spring out of the darknesse and his darknesse shall bee as the noone day this is pure religion and vndefiled before god to visit the fatherlesse and the widdow in their aduersitie remember this he that hath mercie vpon the poore lendeth vnto the lord prou so that when the poore come for releefe god commeth to borrow of vs some of that which he hath giuen vs the poore are the lord collectors now when the lord would borrow of vs shall we make deniall amp send him emptie away thirdly consider that christ himself comes in the perso of the poore that is hungrie sicke naked or in any want and therefore if wee would escape the fearefull sentence of condemnation at the last day away from me ye cursed into euerlasting fire for i was an hungred and ye gaue me no meate ampc then we must haue regard vnto the poore and shew our bountie in their releefe who are our owne flesh so shall wee make god our debtor and bee commended with this church by christ himselfe in this world and at the day of iudgement heare that blessed voyce of his approbation come ye blessed math the third vertue for which this church is commended is their faith by faith here we are to vnderstand fidelitie which is a vertue whereby a man is faithfull to god in keeping that vow and promise which hee made to him in his baptisme which was to renounce and denie himselfe and wholly to giue vp himselfe to acknowledge one god in three persons and accordingly to beleeue in to worship and obey the same god all his life long in this sence is faith taken of paule tim when he sayth that younger widdowes haue damnation because they haue forsaken their first faith and in the former epistles of christ vnto these churches where hee commaunds them to be faithfull it were to bee wished that our churches and congregations might in like manner be commended for their fidelitie to god but that cannot truly be done of vs generally it is a common thing for man to sweare by their faith but it is a rare thing to find a man to keepe his faith as will appeare by this short suruey of our people for first the greatest part in all places are ignorant of god of his word and of their vow to him in baptisme and also voide of care to attaine hereto now all these are vnfaithfull vnto god others though they haue knowledge yet they haue no loue nor care of good things which concerne the kingdome of heauen but all their delight is in eating drink gaming and in pastimes and pleasures herein they spend their time and strength and these also haue denied their first faith amp their case is dangerous for as yet their belly and their pleasure is their god and their end will be damnation a third sort are termed the wise man of the world but if we regard their fidelitie to god there is nothing in them they are worldly persons and earthly minded such as spend both wit and strength to get wealth like vnto the mole who is alwayes in the earth these also are vnfaithfull vnto god in regard of their vow in baptisme for as they account gaine godlinesse so gold is their god and they say to the wedge of gold thou article my confidence seeing then all these be vnfaithfull vnto god we must hereby be admonished to remember what wee haue promised in our baptisme and withall haue care to performe the same as wee tender the saluation of our soules for if we be vnfaithfull as paule said of the yonger widdows damnation belongs vnto vs the fourth vertue for which this church is commended is patience of this i haue spoken before verse here onely note that it is ioyned with loue to man with fidelitie to god and with seruice both to god and man in the duties of loue whereby christ would signifie that no good thing can be done by any man without patience loue is no loue without patience neither is faith any faith without patiece for when a man loueth another for his loue hee shall sometime receiue hatred now vnlesse hee haue patience to beare that hatred his loue will surcease and so if a man haue care to bee faithfull vnto god in the world he shall be sure to haue much contempt so that vnlesse he haue patience to beare the same his faithfulnesse will faile patience bringeth forth experience and experience hope rom amp rom no comfort of the scriptures nor hope without patience and therefore in the parable of the sower the good ground luke bringeth forth fruit with patience though a man haue neuer so good gifts yet without patience he cannot put them in practise this therefore we must ioyne with all the good graces wee haue as peter counselleth vs peter when a man is in temptation and apprehendeth the wrath of god which is the sorest thing that can be without patience he will dispaire without patience a man will bee wearie of well doing both in duties to god and man and to his owne soule hence the apostle saith yee haue need of patience heb and thy workes here christ repeateth his generall comendation of this church which we must not thinke to be done in vaine but herby he would let vs see how exceeding well hee did approue of their workes the cause why he liked them so well was their increase in well doing whereof we shall intreat afterward christ repeateth his approbation of their workes after foure worthy vertues to shew vnto vs what things are required in the doing of any worke that shall bee acceptable to god namely these foure things faith loue seruice and patience faith is necessarie because in well doing a man must testifie his fidelity to god which hee shall best doe if first hee learne out of the word whether god haue commanded that worke to be done or not that so hee may bee sure to do or not do that which god will haue him for it is not sufficient to haue a good intent in the doing of our workes as is comonly thought though falsly but our workes must be done in faith that is in a sure persuasio out of god word that the things we do are approued of god for whatsoeuer is not of faith is sinne secondly loue is necessarie in euery good worke we go about for faith worketh by loue gal hence the apostle saith corinthian if a man should giue his body to bee burned and bestow all his goods in almes vpon the poore yet if he did not these in loue it would not please god thirdly seruice to man is required in our good workes this must be carefully marked for the end of mans life is in his calling to serue man and by that to serue god column servant must obey their maisters and in their persons doe seruice vnto christ and that which is there spoken of servant must bee referred to the works of euery man in his calling they must be done for the good of man so as god may bee serued in them this ouerthrowes the foolish conceit of the papistes which thinke that the most excellent workes of all are fasting pilgramage wearing of rough attire and whipping of their body for good workes must bee done in faith and loue to benefit man either in soule or bodie but these works of theirs are not done in faith neither do they profit the doers nor any others fasting hath it place yet it is no good worke but a thing indifferent in it selfe lastly patience is necessarie in euery good worke that man faint not in doing that which is good for they that do any good thing shall be sure of many crosses partly from man and partly from sathan as also by god prouidece now when these befal a man in well doing without patiece they wil stay his proceeding and therfore it is truly said that be good ground bringeth forth fruit with patiece these being the vertues that make a worke acceptable to god we must labour in euery action of our lawful calling whatsoeuer it bee to practise the same in faith loue seruice and patience we must not tie good workes to church matters onely as hearing the word and giuing almes but the practise of any worke of a mans lawful calling be it neuer so base with these vertues is a good worke and approued of god in it kind as well as the best worke that is not for the worke it selfe but because therein doth appeare faith loue seruice and patience and because this church so performed their workes therefore doth god double his approbation the last vertue for which this church is commended is increase in godlinesse in these words and that they are moe at the last than at the first the church of ephesus was before reprooued for decay and losse of the graces of god but this church did grow and increase in graces and therfore are her works more approued than the works of any other church it were to be wished that our congregations might bee commended for their increase in godlinesse in faith obedience and other good workes but that cannot iustly bee done for the number of our people is increased but their growth in grace doth not appeare many liue in ignorance and though they heare much yet they profit little so as it may be sayd of them as the author to the hebrews saith h b whereas concerning the time ye ought to be teachers you haue need againe that we teach you the first principles of the word of god and as paul saith of certaine woman tim they are alwayes learning and neuer come to the knowledge of the truth others also though they know something yet they practise lesse than they which know nothing and which is worst of all many that heretofore haue ad good beginning in them by their bad conuersation and the greedie cares of this world haue lost the same againe and go backward in knowledge in obedience in faith and loue rare it is to find those that are like to this church of thyatira whose workes are better at the last than at the first a fearfull case it is to be ignorant of god will and a great iudgement of god to decay in loue and other graces and therefore that wee may preuent god iudgements wee must haue care to get knowledge and to increase therein and with knowledge to ioyne obedience in all good duties to god and man some plead for themselues by reason of age want of memorie and capacity but these must learne to shew foorth better affections and more sincere obedience the yonger sort also must imploy their wit and strength to get knowledge and with knowledge ioyne obedience that they may increase in grace as they grow in dayes yes euery one that hath any good beginning must indeuour to make it more for to him that hath shall more giuen and he shal haue abundance but from him that hideth his gift or abuseth the same shall bee taken away that which he seemeth to haue luke here is christs reproofe of this church of thyatira and it is twofold first of the whole church in this verse secondly of a woman in that church verse in the reproofe of the whole church note two things the reproofe it selfe and the reason thereof the reproofe it selfe is contained in these words notwithstanding i haue something against thee that is though i haue praised thee for manie worthie works yet there be some things which i do not approue this reproofe hath bin handled in the former epistles the reason of the reproofe followeth in these words that thou sufferest the woman iesabell who calleth her selfe a prophetesse to teach and seduce my servant this reason of her reproofe containeth sundry points worthie our consideration i from the phrase and forme of the words wee may consider the large power that god gaue to his church which was besides the power to preach the word amp administer the sacraments a further power to appoint who should preach among them amp who should not preach and also a power to represse euill man and euill woman amp so to keepe them in order the like power was giuen to the church of ephesus as we haue seene in the epistle to that church they had power to discerne false prophets amp apostles and to restraine the same the like power did god giue to all churches as we shall see if wee read the history of the church and great cause there is hereof for without this authoritie no church could long stand amp be a church ii here note that it is not sufficient for a church to haue the preaching of the word but it must haue seueritie and sharpe gouernement whereby wicked people may be restrained this church is therefore discommended for that shee vsed not that seuere authoritie which god had giuen her in suppressing of sin and in our congregations the like fault is to be found where much preaching is yet sinne abounds as adultery blasphemie vsurie and cruelty and the cause is for that this seuere execution of gouernment in restraining sinnes is not so straitly put in practise as it ought to be againe in this reason of his reprofe christ doth charge the with two faults first for suffering a woman to teach secondly for suffering a woman to seduce his people for the first the word translated teach is in the new testament commonly put for publicke teaching in the ministerie their fault then was this that they suffered a woman to teach openly and it is against the word of god tim i permit not a woman to teach and corinthian woman ought to keepe silence in the congregation and be subiect to their husbands and learne of them at home obiect but deborah was a prophetesse iud and hulda prophesied kin for iosiah sent to her for counsell chro and therefore woman may prophesie an these wome had extraordinary gifts amp calling amp therefore vpon their exaple we may not make an ordinary rule ii ob but it may seeme paul alloweth it when he saith a woman praying or prophecying vncouered dishonoreth her head co answer hereto some do answer thus that in the infancie of the church some woman were extraordinarily indued with that gift and did indeed prophesie others iudge it to haue bene a fault in that church and therfore say in the cha the apostle reproueth it commaunding woman to keepe silence in the churches thirdly a woman may be sayd to pray when she giueth her assent to the prayer of the minister by saying amen and she may be sayd to prophesie when she singeth psalmes or readeth the scripture for so the word is vsed in scripture chronicle asaph and his company prophesied with harpes and vials that is as it is translated they sung prophesies and playd thereunto vpon their instruments from the rebuke of christ against this church we gather that it is not warrantable by god word for a woman to administer the sacrament of baptisme for baptisme is a seale of the couenant in the publicke ministerie and so a part thereof and must goe with the preaching of the word and may not bee administred by woman who are not allowed to preach no not in time and case of necessitie when man are wanting and although they may not teach publickly yet they may teach at home and in the absence of their husband it is her duty to teach her children prouerb lemuel that is salomon is taught many worthie things of his mother and timothie was broght vp of a child in the scriptures by his grandmother lois and his mother eunice tim hence some would gather that as a woman may not teach publickely so she may not publickely gouerne in the commonwealth but this consequence is not good for publicke teaching is flatly forbidden to a woman so is not publicke ciuile regiment there is speciall reason why shee may not publickely teach for it is the will of god that as christ was a man so they that stand in his roome and stead in the publicke ministerie should also be man but the regiment of a kingdome is a ciuile thing and so may lawfully bee administred by a woman when shee commeth vnto it by lawful succession to her father whose whole patrimonie in the want of sonnes she may rightly enioy obiect but the woman must b e in subiection vnto the man corinthian answer so shee may and yet haue soueraignetie in the kingdome obiect but the man is the head of the woman corinthian answer that is the man in that he i a man is a person more excellent than the woman as she is a woman yet the person that in regard of sexe is inferiour may haue more excellent gifts and so likewise may exercise authoritie and rule and wee find by good experience that the gouernment of a woman is a ha pie gouernment no records of time can shew a more happie regiment for blessings temporall and spirituall vnder any man than wee haue long enioyed vnder our noble queene the second fault of this church is that they suffered a woman to seduce and teach false doctrine and thereby to seduce god people that this is a fault christs reproofe sheweth euidently and therefore i will not stand to prooue it hence wee may gather that euery man is not to bee left to his owne conscience to teach and hold what doctrine he will but all such man or woman as each erronious doctrines by the gouernors of the church are to bee restrained it is a grieuous fault in any church not to restraine the authours and maintainers of sects and false doctrines and of opinions which stand not with the truth of god word and on the contrarie it is a vertue and a good gift in any church when they restraine the authours and fauourers of sects and false doctrine and in this regard our church is to bee commended and approoued and the commonwealth likewise for making lawes to restraine both popish recusants and some protestant who depart from this our church as being no church of god but a member of antichrist and of babylon now that christ might aggrauate these their offences hee doth describe both the woman and her teaching hee describeth the woman first by her propertie in this name i zabell that is one like iezabell secondly by her action which calleth her selfe a prophetesse her teaching is described in the end of the verse touching her propertie christ calleth her iezabell for two causes first for that she was like to iezabell and in her person reuiued the manners and opinions of iezabell for as iezabell brought among the israelites the false worship of the idoll baal so this woman laboured to bring into this church of thyatira idolatry and other sinnes againe iezabell was giuen to fornication as the scripture recordeth of her by the mouth of iehu kings and so was this woman giuen to fornication thirdly iezabell was a woman of authoritie and by her place and dignitie did countenance and maintaine idolatry and her wicked sinnes so it is lik that this woman was of some place and authoritie and did ther by countenance her wicked opinions and damnable sinnes in this reason of her name note first a notable practise of sathan for the furtherance of his kingdome which is this in succeeding ages hee laboureth to reuiue the erronious opinions and wicked vices of vngodly persons of former times this wee see plaine in this place for long after zabel death the wife of ahab a wicked woman uen in the apostles time he raised vp nother woman like iezabell both for wicked life and doctrine and the like practise hee vseth at this day in all such as follow the rules and counsell of machiauell is reuiued the craft of achitophell in the papists are reuiued the opinions and manners of the wicked scribes and pharisees in the recusant protestant is reuiued the sect of the donatists and the sect called audiani the familie of loue reuiues the opinions and manners of the valentinians and the montanists and many other damnable errours now this the deuill doth because hee knowes by experience the great hurt that these opinions and sinnes haue formerly done vnto god church secondly christ calleth this woman iezabell that he may prouoke this church to a greater detestation of her in regard of her damnable wayes and that shee might be in as great disgrace with them as was iezabell in the old testament to the people of god that so they might better eschew her wicked seducement and herein we haue a good direction for our profitable reading of the bookes of the old and new testament namely that when we meet with examples of wicked man and wicked woman we must thereby take occasion to be vnlike them and if we find our selues like them any way either in wicked opinion or in practise wee must thereupon grow to a dislike with our selues againe finding the examples of good man or good woman wee must labour to conforme our selues thereto and become like them and in this regard approoue our selues when wee see our selues conformable vnto the godly in any vertue and grace the second argument wherby christ describeth this woman is her action shee calleth her selfe a prophetesse that is shee chalengeth her selfe to bee one that doth teach god will by the instinct of his spirit and herein shee became a notable patrone of the damnable sect of the nicolaitans for she held the lawfulnesse of fornication and of eating things sacrificed to idols and for the maintenance hereof shee sayth shee is a prophetesse one that speaketh nothing but as shee is taught by god spirit this is the practise of heretickes vnder pretence of the spirit to maintaine their damnable deuices as might easily bee prooued by induction of particular heretickes in former ages first hence then we are taught to labour to haue the spirit of discerning whereby we may trie the spirits whether they be of god or not many will bee of no religion because there bee so many false teachers and such diuersitie of opinions in religion but herein they bewray their prophanesse they ought the rather to labour for this gift of discerning whereby to know what is from god and what is not secondly hence wee are taught that when wee are vniustly slaundered disgraced or iniured wee ought not to fret and fume but by patience to content our selues for wee see that wicked man to maintaine their wicked opinions and manners will not sticke to abuse god himselfe and make his blessed spirit the author and patrone of their errours and sinnes wee by our sinnes deserue disgrace and reproch but the spirit of god hath done nothing amisse and therfore wee must bee patient being in the same condemnation as luke and rather reioyce in as much as wee are partakers of the sufferings of the spirit pet verse againe here obserue how shee prooueth her selfe to be a prophetesse namely by her owne testimonie onely she calleth her selfe so where we may see the note and marke of a false prophet to wi their owne bare word and testimonie a true prophet or prophetesse hath sundry testimonies besides their owne words to proue the lawfulnesse of their calling as in the primitiue church they had the gift of speaking diverse languages without studie and of working miracles they had also puritie of doctrine ioyned with integritie of life amp lastly many excellent gifts of god as zeale courage and constancie to maintaine the same christ hauing described this woman for her further disgrace as also to aggrauate the fault of this church in suffering her proceedeth to describe her doctrine and first hee sheweth the end and scope thereof namely to seduce and to deceiue wherein he giueth vs a further note of a false prophet or prophetesse to wit to teach such doctrine as drawes man to sinne against the first or second table true doctrine is according vnto godlinesse and leadeth man thereto but the end of false doctrine is impietie against god and man as was shewed by the doctrine of balaam verse and such was the doctrine of this woman sundry students now adayes are maruellously affected with the sermons commentaries and postils of monks and friers these they prefer before the writings of other godly and sound diuines which is a lamentable case for they are in their kind iezabels the scope of their doctrine is to draw man to errours and transgressions against the law of god yes to bring man from heauen to hell and therefore this exceeding approbation of them is no small offence being in truth the right way to bring in againe errors atheisme and popery for turne a papist from a morall point wherein he often erreth and his doctrine and sermons are nothing but false and erronious and therefore as christ would haue this church to hate the doctrine of this woman because it did deceiue so must wee labour to grow in dislike with the commentaries and postils of monks and friers which tend to that end secondly christ setteth forth the end of her doctrine by two arguments first by the persons deceiued his servant secondly by the meanes whereby they are deceiued to wit by causing them to commit fornication and to eat mea es sacrificed vnto idols touching the persons whereas shee deceiued not all man but the servant of god for here is a plaine distinction of man this encreaseth her fault because they belonged vnto god but here two questions may bee mooued first why some man are the servant of god and some are not secondly whether the servant of god may bee seduced by false teachers to the first some answere that god would haue all man bee his servant and for his part doth all things needfull vnto all man to make them his servant redeeming them and giuing them sufficient grace hereunto yet some are not his servant because they themselues will not but wilfully reiect his grace that is offered vnto them but this doctrine is against common reason and doth much derogate from the glorie of god for hereby they make euery man an emperour and god an vnderling subiect vnto man they make god good pleasure to depend vpon mans pleasure and the accepting of his grace to depend vpon mans will but god is the first cause of all things his will ouerruleth mans will and therefore it is absurd to say some man are not god servant because they themselues will not the true cause hereof is god good pleasure electing some and they alone become his servant because hee hath chosen them but god did neuer chuse all man first to grace amp then to glorie and therfore as luke saith act so many as were ordained to euerlasting life beleeued so wee may say so many as are elected of god to grace and saluation they become his servant the second question whether may god servant be seduced by false prophets answer there bee two sorts of servant of god servant in appearance and servant in truth servant in appearance are such as outwardly onely embrace the word and receiue the seales of god couenant and the greatest part of particular churches are such servant now these may fall away and that wholly and hence it commeth that whole particular churches may fall away as did the church of galatia and many other and these are called servant because we must in charitie iudge that all which make professio of true religion in god church are the servant of god but the true servant of god though they may be seduced in part and for a time yet they can neither wholly nor finally fall away for the promise of christ is to the contrarie mat thou peter and vpon this rocke that is the faith which thou professest will i build my temple and the gates of hell shall not preuaile against which last word preuaile insinuateth that the diuell shall shew great malice and strength to vanquish their faith but yet shal neuer wholly ouercome it and matth we are taught to pray l ad vs into temptation to be lead into temptation is wholly to be ouercome in temptation which being a lawful petition must needs haue god promise to graunt the same belonging vnto it and therefore though sa han may assay to ouercome the child of god yet he shall neuer get finall victory ouer him for true faith purifieth the heart and cannot stand with a purpose to continue in any one sinne these two banish each other sinne brings the child of god vpon his knees but true faith doth raise him vp againe ii point the means wherby she sought to seduce the was by drawing them to commit fornication and to eate things sacrificed to idols whereby it is plaine shee was a fauourer of the sect of the nicolaitans whereof entreatie was made in the foureteenth verse and thus much for the reproofe of the church here christ reprooueth this woman for her obstinacie and hardnesse of heart whereby shee went on in sinne without repentance by space to repent wee are to vnderstand libertie to liue for though by her sinnes she deserued present death temporall and eternall yet god of his mercy gaue her libertie to liue that shee might repent in her example we are taught what to iudge of that space of time which god giueth vs to liue in this world namely th it is a time of repentance for before a man be borne and after this life can none repent but the time wee now liue or haue liued or shall liue is the only time allotted for repentance this point ought seriously to bee considered of all estates for it doth plainely rebuke the shamefull practise of many at this day who lead not their life as a time of repentance but spend it wholly in another course some in following their vaine pleasures as carding dicing ampc some in heaping vp riches seeking nothing but temporall profites others in good fellowship as they call it that is in company keeping in eating and drink god in iustice might haue cut off these man so soone as they were borne and yet in mercie hee giues them time to repent to some twentie to others thirtie fortie or fiftie yeares but they abuse this mercie of god and in steed of repenting imploy themselues in such workes as are contrarie thereunto their case is most fearefull they treasure vp to themselues wrath against the day of wrath amp declaration of the iust iudgement of god like vnto a man that euery day for some certaine time carrieth a faggot for his own burning in the end secondly from this end of life all that haue not repented must learne not to deferre their repentance but now begin while it is called to day and in the exercise thereof spend the whole time of their life the end of all our endeauours while wee liue should be this to get a roome in the kingdome of god which wee can neuer haue without repentance next consider who it is that giues this time of repentance neither man nor angell hath this time in his hands but the power of appointing it belongs vnto christ alone hereby then all persons whatsoeuer are to bee admonished without delay to repent the young man will take his pleasure in his youth and repent when he is old but hereby he robbeth christ of his honour who onely hath power to point out the time of repentance vse therefore the time present while thou hast it and deferre not repentance for how knowest thou that thou shalt liue to bee old and though thou doest yet how canst thou tell whether god will giue thee repentance considering thou diddest refuse while he called for it man thinke that if they die quietly and peaceably all is well they goe to heauen straight but herewith many are deceiued for vnlesse they haue truely repented they goe straight to the deuill let their manner of dying be what it will a quiet death is a comfortable thing but no sure signe of grace because it may come by reason of some easie lingering sickenesse considering therefore wee haue no title vnto this grace of repentance to clayme it at our pleasure it being the rare gift of god nor any lea of our life but bee meere tenants at will let vs seeke to turne to god with full purpose of heart while is called to day and if we haue begun let vs dayly renew this grace to the end of our life thirdly consider to whome god giues space of repentance namely to a wicked woman as wicked as iezabell wherein behold the endlesse mercie of god that vnto such a wicked person who blasphemed god in fathering her sinnes vpon the spirit of grace and dishonoured god by seducing his servant doth yet vouchsafe a time of repentance this hath beene and is the dealing of god with most grieuous sinners manasses was one that sold himselfe to worke wickednesse giuing himselfe to sorcerie and idolatry and yet vpon his heartie repentance god receiued him to mercie and salomon fell most fearefully but yet before his death wee may persuade our selues hee repented and was receiued to mercie for hee was a penman of scripture all which were holy man of god as peter sayth pet the israelites were isa a people of sodome and of gomorrha as bad as those who are condemned in hell and yet mercie is offered vnto them vpon their true repentance and conuersion hereby no man must take occasion to liue in his sinnes but those that feele themselues laden with the huge burden of their transgressions haue here a comfort to keepe them from despaire for if they can humble themselues and turne vnto christ and pray for the pardon of their sinnes there is yet with the lord mercie in store that they may bee saued lastly christ saith he gaue her space to repent of her fornication no doubt she had many other sinnes whereof shee was to repent for no sinne goeth alone but euery capitall sinne draweth many with it christ his meaning therefore is not that she should let passe other sins without repentance but he nameth this one sin of fornication because it was a principall sinne in her for she both practised it in her owne bodie and so made her selfe the stable of the diuell who should haue bene the temple of god holy spirit and also maintained this sinne and so drew others thereto now speciall and principall repentance must be of principall sinnes here then is a patterne for all sinners how to practise repentance they must beginne with their capitall sinnes which burden their conscience and whereto they are most addicted and repent of them for the man that truly repenteth of one sinne repenteth of all for true repentance maketh the heart alike affected to all sinnes and that heart which is brought to hate his speciall sinnes will neuer approue of pettie sinnes this lesson ought carefully to be learned amp put in practise for the repentance of most man is onely in generall to say wee are all sinners lord haue mercie vpon me or god forgiue me but this confused repentance is not good it stands with a purpose to sinne againe in particular therefore we must search our consciences and see wherein we haue most dishonored god and what sinne hath neerest plunged our soules to the pit of hell and with that we must beginne to bring our soules to heauen by repenting truly for the same and turning from it with all our hearts hence the papists gather that man hath free will to doe that which is truly good before god as namely to repent for say they god gaue iesabell space of time to repent and therefore shee had power to repent or else the giuing of that time vnto her had bene in vaine answer their reason is nought it followeth not because god gaue her time to repent therefore she had power of her selfe to repent as will easily appeare if wee consider the ends for which god giues man space amp time of repentance and commandement so to do the ends are two i that in that time of repentance which hee allotteth to man hee may giue his children grace whereby they may be enabled to obey his commandement and to repent for the lord vseth the commandements and threatnings of the law and the promises of the gospell as outward meanes of giuing grace vnto man by the worke of his spirit ii he giueth commaundement and time to repent that man may see what they should doe not what they can doe and that the wicked may bee without excuse at the day of iudgement and be ashamed of their slauerie amp bondage vnto sinne in this life and shee repented not here the sinne of iezabell is expressed namely her impenitencie and hardnesse of heart whereby without remorse shee liued in her fornication and idolatry for the vnderstanding of this her sinne two points are to bee considered i where this sinne of impenitencie is forbidden in god word ii what is the greatnesse of this sinne for the first there bee two parts of god word the law and the gospell which must not be confounded but distinguished or else wee shall ouerturne manie points of christian religion the law giues commandements touching things that were by nature in adam before his fall forbidding those things which are contrarie to those vertues which were in his perfect nature but the gospell commands amp forbids things that are aboue nature and in that part of god word is this sinne of impenitencie forbidden for the law condemnes no more than it reuealeth but it neuer reuealed repentance and therefore it doth not forbid or condemne the want thereof secondly for the greatnesse of this sinne it may appeare because hereby man heape sin vpon sinne and rom wrath vnto themselues against the day of wrath some to aggrauate the grieuousnesse of this sinne say that impenitencie is the sinne against the holy ghost and that opinion is antient but yet false and erronious for the sinne against the holy ghost is a blasphemie mat but this is not a blasphemy again the sinne against the holy ghost is in this life but finall impenitencie is neuer before the end of this life hence also the papistes gather free will to good by nature shee did not repent therefore she had freewill amp power to repent if she would ans this reason is not good thus much may hence be gathered that she had freewil not to repent and to sinne for euery man sinneth freely but yet it followeth not that they haue the same power to cease from sinne or to repent without god special grace without which no man can will or doe that which is truly good before god againe the same sinne which is reproued in this wicked woman may bee layd to the charge of the greatest number in our churches and congregations god hath giuen vnto man a long time of repentance to some ten to some twenty yeares but they repent not as their liues do plainly testifie for some liue in irreligion and prophanenesse some in saboath breaking some in fornication and adulterie some in idlenesse some in couetousnesse and extortion giuing themselues wholly and spending all their time in seeking the things of this life neuer regarding with reuerence th things of god christ hauing reprooued this church and this woman for their seuerall faults doth here giue speciall counsell and direction vnto them both whereby they may auoid amp escape the grieuous iudgements due vnto them for their sinnes both in this life and in the life to come this counsell of christ hath two parts first to iesabell and her company verse the second to the church of thyatira verse the summe of christs counsell to iesabell is to repent which is not expressed but insteed thereof the reason to moue her to repentance is propounded and it may be framed thus if thou repent not i will pun sh thee with sundry iudgements but thou wouldest not be so punished and therefore repent this reason hath two parts a threatning and an exception thereof the threatning in these words i will cast her into a bed and them that commit fornication with her into great affliction and before this threatning christ prefixeth a word of attention behold whereby hee would teach them and vs that wee ought seriously to consider of the threatnings that are propounded in god word against sinne and sinners when iosias heard the booke of the law read hi heart ki melted which it could neuer haue done vnlesse it had first trembled at the iudgements therein denounced and the pricking that was wrought in the hearts of the iewes act by peters first sermon was nothing else but a compunction wrought in them vpon consideration of the iudgements and condemnation due vnto them for crucifying the lord of life the cause why sinne is so rise in euery estate and condition of man at this day is for that man set light by the threatnings of god word if man would tremble when they heare of god iudgements it would make them crie out man and brother what shall we do but because god is mercifull therefore man feare him not isay this threatning hath three seuerall parts according to the three seueral sorts of persons whom it concerneth the i is against iesabell her selfe who was the chiefe of them all in these words i will cast her into a bed the meaning whereof may bee gathered out of the like words of iona to ammon bidding him sa lye downe on his bed and make himselfe sicke so that christs meaning is that he wil strike her with some grieuous sicknes the place of the sick person being put for the sicknesse it selfe as if hee should say iesabell takes her pleasure in fornication and thereto abuseth the bed i will therfore send on her some great sicknesse which shall cast her into her bed here note god dealing with sinners in those thing which they abuse for the furtherance of their sinnes will the lord plague and punish them i sabell abused her bed with fornication amp thither shee must bee cast with sicknesse diue in his life time abused his tongue and tast by gluttonie and therefore now in in hell therein most of all plag d and tormented at hi crying lu drop of water to coole his tongue doth import gamesters take their pleasure in ding and dicing which many times god turneth to their wo for therby they are vsually brought to extreame want and miserie ahab shed naboths bloud to get his vineyard and for that sinne must kin his bloud the bloud of iezabell and his children he shed and now in these dayes the couetous for their gaine doe suck the bloud of the poore but that bloud will haue bloud from them againe the lord will spoyle the soule of him that spoyle the poore prou this must make vs to beware how we abuse any creature of god to serue vs for any sinne for the lord will cause that to bee a meanes of woe and punishment vnto vs which we misuse vnto our lusts againe note here who is the author of grieuous sicknesses namely christ himselfe for he saith i will cast her into a bed sicknesses come not by chaunce or fortune but from the hand of god this wee must learne to beleeue and it will cause vs to make better vse of sicknesses than vsually we do if man did beleeue this it would make the hardest heart to repent in time of sicknesse for this they would say hath god cast me downe with sicknesse no doubt it is to humble me for some of my sinnes to make me know them to leaue them and to turne vnto him this vse the servant of god haue made hereof isa when the prophet came to hez ias and told him hee should die he turned his face to the wall and wept as for other things so for his sinnes especially and iaacob being to die heb lea ed on his affe and by faith worshippe towards the beds head lifting vp his body to do reuerence vnto god thereby testifying his humilitie faith and hope and the like ought we to do which if wee could wee should find our sicknesse would become a blessing vnto vs the second part of christs threatning is the punishment of her followers which receiued her doctrine amp committed fornication with her they must bee cast into great affliction first this must teach all persons that it is a diuell sh speech to thinke and say that fornication i but a tricke and shippe of for great affliction is the punishment of this sinne which notably argueth the haynousnesse thereof secondly hence we may gather some of the causes why townes and kingdomes are afflicted with grieuous war famine and pestilence among the rest these are two fornication nd embracing of errours and superstition sodome for fornication and other was burnt with fire amp brimstone from heauen the israelits number for this sin suffered most grieuous affliction and among the corinthians for comming to the lord table in this sin among others corinthian with cap amp many were sicke many and many sle and this land of ours hath bene afflicted with famine and pestilence as for other sinnes so for fornication which in time of peace is multiplied and so will continue till it draw vpon vs bloudshed also and great afflictions for that which is sayd of the followers of iesabel must be verified of all that liue in the like sinnes the second part of the reason is the exception of these communications except they repent them of their workes where we may see first that all the threatnings of god iudgements and of eternall destruction must bee vnderstood with the exception of repentance whence also this followeth that man of yeares liuing in the church are not so much condemned for other particular sins as for liuing in their sins without repent ee euery sin makes a man subiect to damnation but it is this impenitencie that brings vpon the actuall danation want of repentance for sin is more dangerous than the sin it selfe the consideration whereof must teach vs not to lie in sinne though wee haue committed it but turne to god by speedie repentance for it is the continuance in sinne without repentance that casteth the soule to hell when thou shalt turne from thy sinne by true repentance thou article free from the threatning and the curse of sinne for they admitting the exception of true repentance further obserue how this exception of repentance is placed betweene two threatnings of iudgements which sheweth how god mingleth his iudgements with mercie hee sheweth not wholly either iustice or mercie but tempereth them together in all the workes that concerne mans saluation thirdly here note that repentance preuents not onely eternall damnation but also temporall iudgements as grieuous sicknesses and other plagues and afflictions this point may haue speciall vse among vs wee haue by god mercie enioyed his gospell with long peace but for our abuse thereof we may iustly feare it shall be taken from vs and if we would escape that iudgement wee must repent both high and low of their work s that is of their idolatry and fornication where hee sheweth of what things true repentance must be namely of bad workes in particular whereto man giue themselues euerie man that would truly repent must consider of his particular faults the drunkerd in particular of his drunkennesse and the couetous man of his couetousnesse and insteed of iniuries and hard dealing shew mercy vnto the poore the common repentance of the world that is done in generall is nothing but a visard of repentance and yet it is all that is vsed of the greatest part of our people for they will come to heare the word and to receiue the sacraments and in generall confesse themselues to bee sinners and then they thinke they haue done enough but true repentance is of particular sinnes as dauid psalm cried out of bloud guiltinesse here is the third part of christs threatning against iesabels children by children wee are to vnderstand properly those which are borne of her and were of her husband and not her followers for they were threatned with grieuous afflictions in the former verse it had bene sufficient to haue sayd i will her children but to note the certainty and greeuousnesse of this punishment he saith i will kill them with death quest how can this stand with the iustice of god to punish the offences of the parents in the person of the children ans god deareth so for temporall punishments not for eternall and though we could not perceiue the iustice of god in so doing yet wee must reuerence the ame blaming our owne ignorance albeit euen in reason wee may conceiue of the equitie of this course for societies as church commonwealth and families are god ordinance and the parties in them must bee considered as members of those societies for god conceiueth of them when hee afflicteth the punishment deserued by one vpon another as of the prince vpon the people of the parents vpon their children this hee may iustly do by reason of that neere bond which is betweene the members of the same societie like as in the naturall bodie when the stomacke is distempered the head aketh and when the head is wounded the stomacke is sicke and the bodie may bee smitten for the errours of the tongue thus when dauid sinned the child died and when hee numbred the israelites the people were plagued and thus is the child stained in bloud for the fathers treason against earthly princes and so god punished this woman in her children that shee might knowe the greatnesse of her sinnes hee smote her children with death hence parents are taught to make conscience of euerie sinne for thereby they may bring iudgements vpon their children and familie euen to death now what bloudie hearted parents are those that will make no conscience of doing that whereby they bring vengeance vppon their owne children and by the same reason must euery man that liues in any societie be admonished to take heed of sinne because thereby a man especially if hee bee a principall member of a societie may bring destruction vpon many as dauid did by numbring the people and achan by his couetous stealth iosua and ahab vpon his posteritie so that impenitent persons which will not be reformed but go on in sinne ought to bee banished both from church and commonwealth as hurtfull members yes enemy to all good societies that these threatnings might take place in the hearts of iesabell and her followers christ remooueth two carnall conceits whereby they might thinke to delude or escape these iudgements threatned the first is this iesabell and her company might thinke that their practises were secret not knowne to the world and therefore they were not in danger of god iudgements this is a wicked imagination that comes into the mind of all sinners but this christ cuts off saying and all the churches shall know that i am hee which search the reines and the hearts as if he should say to iesabell and her company you may persuade your selues that because your sinnes are secret therefore my iudgements shall not befall you but know that i will discouer your secret sinnes and practises in such sort as all churches shall know by experience in your persons that i do see and discerne the most hidden thoughts of mans heart first here obserue to whome christ will discouer their sinnes not to all the world but to the church of god all churches shall know this christ doth to terrifie iesabell amp her company for as it is an excellent honour to bee well esteemed of with the churches of god so it is a most shamefull dishonour to bee in disgrace with the churches of god for mat whatsoeuer is bound or loosed by the churches on earth the same is bound or loosed in heauen and therefore by due proportion it followeth that they which are in disgrace with god churches on earth are also in disgrace with god himselfe in heauen hence wee are taught that howsoeuer we must so much as in vs lieth endeuour to approoue our selues to the whole world yet especially wee must labour to bee in good account with the churches of god and the members thereof and on the contrarie we must continually auoide the doing of all such things as may iustly bring vs into disgrace with the church of god rom the churches of christ salute you and corinthian all the churches of asia salute you where the apostle meaneth not that they did by word of mouth send greetings vnto them but hereby hee would signifie that all churches did approue of them which hee saith for their great comfort paule receiued timothie into the company because the churches gaue him a good report act but what is the thing that all churches should know by experience in the persons of iezabell and her company namely that christ is he which doth indeed search the reynes and the hearts where by reynes and hearts wee must vnderstand the same things namely the thoughts and affections of man for in that sence those words are often vsed in the old testament quest how can reynes signifie the thoughts and affections seeing the thoughts are seated in the braine and the affections in the heart answer the reynes are put for the thoughts and affections not because they are seated therein but for that resemblance and analogie that is betweene them for as the reynes are seated in the most secret part of the bodie so the thoughts and affections are seated in the most secret place of the soule and the heart is p rt for the thoughts and affections first because the affections are there seated secondly because the thoughts though they bee seated in the braine yet they haue their operation in the heart for ioyfull thoughts make a merry heart and fearefull thoughts an heauie heart againe the word search signifieth a most narrow search and such a one as goeth with finding thereby shewing that nothing is so secret in man but the lord both can and doth see and discerne the same hence wee learne first that christ our sauiour is not onely man but very god one person standing of two natures that christ is man heretickes denie not but whether he be god or not there is the question which yet is here euidently prooued for hee that hath in him the peculiar properties of god must needs be god but christ hath in him the true properties of god he can search and discerne all the thoughts and all the affections of the hearts of all man which none can doe but god onely ierem the heart is deceitfull and wicked aboue all things who can know it i the lord search the he t and trie the reynes and therefore christ is the true and very god secondly hereby wee are taught to beware and take heed of hypocrisie in all things but especially in the matters of religion hypocrisie is when a man seemes outwardly to be that which hee is not inwardly but wee must haue care to bee truly in heart that which we appeare to bee in life and profession wee must come as neere christ in thought and affection as in our outward action for christ knowes as well the whole estate of euerie mans reynes and heart as he doth their speeches and their deeds thirdly hereby wee must learne to suspect our selues of our vnknowne sinnes as of our vnbeleefe and presumption not contenting our selues with an acknowledgement of our known sinnes for wee can neuer discerne the depth of our corrupt heart and yet god knoweth them this was dauids practise psalm after due examination of himselfe hee yet crieth lord cleanse mee from my secret sinnes as if he should say i haue o lord searched my heart but i cannot sufficiently know mine owne corruptions therefore doe thou o lord helpe to cleanse mee from them if this were practised true religion would flourish for many iustifie themselues when as they know not what is in their hearts little considering what christ sayth vnto the pharisees luke you are they which iustifie your selues before man but christ knoweth your hearts and i will giue to euery one of you according to your workes here christ proceedeth to remooue a second wicked conceit whereby they might seeme to illude god iudgements threatened for they might say let the lord send iudgments and plagues vpon vs yet wee shall escape them as isay sayd of the wicked in his time that they made a league with death and hell and sayd the iudgements of god shall passe ouer them isay verse but to cut off this vaine conceit christ threateneth a iust reward to euery one according to his workes as if hee should say you may sooth vp your selues and falsely thinke that you shall escape my iudgements but know it that i will reward euery one of you partly in this life and principally at the day of iudgement according to your workes bee they good or bad for these words must especially ee vnderstood of the day of iudgement as they are vsed and revelation hence the papists gather that man are saued not onely by faith in christ but also by workes for thus they reason y that whereby wee must bee iudged must wee bee iustified and a ed but by workes wee must bee iudged and therefore saued answer the proposition is false there is great difference betweene iustifying and iudging for iudging is onely the declaration of a man to bee iust but iustification is the making of a man iust and because the declaration of a man to bee iust is by workes therefore is iudgement by workes againe it is not sayd i will giue to you for your works but according to your workes if he had sayd i will giue to euery one of you for your workes then it might haue seemed they had bin iustified by them but here christ doth only make works an outward signe or rule whereto hee will conforme and square the last iudgement secondly whereas euery man must bee iudged that is saued or condemned according to his workes hence wee may gather that good workes are necessarie to saluation yet not as causes thereof either efficient or helping any way but onely as a way or meanes to come vnto saluation for faith is necessarie and good workes are the tokens and fruits of faith and so are necessarie thirdly here we must bee admonished to bee carefull to abound in good workes not to win heauen by them but to get assurance of saluation in our selues and these good workes are the doing of the duties of pietie vnto god and of charitie vnto our brother euen the duties of the morall law or more plainely the doing of the generall duties of a christian and the particular duties of a mans calling for if these bee done in obedience to god and to his glory proceeding from faith and loue vnto our brother though the calling bee neuer so base they are good workes and on the contrarie this must admonish vs to make conscience of euery euill way for sinnes be the markes of condemnation and so many wicked workes as we commit so many markes and brands doe wee set vpon our selues of our iust and deserued condemnation vnlesse wee repent lastly hence wee may gather that there bee degrees of ioy in heauen and of torments in hell for iudgements and rewards goe according to mens workes and therefore they that testifie their faith by great and many good workes shall haue great reward they that testifie their faith by less and fewer workes shall haue less reward and so for sinnes the more heynous they bee the deeper condemnation they doe procure verse and to you i say the rest of them of thyatira as many as haue not this learning neither haue knowne the deepenesse of sathan as they speake i will put vpon you none other burden but that which you haue already hold fast till i come here christ commeth to a second part of his counsell which concernes the angell and the better part of this church of thyatira and first hee beginneth with the preface of this counsell wherein wee may obserue two points first who speaketh secondly to whom hee speaketh for the first hee that speaketh is christ i say hereby christ challengeth vnto himselfe the absolute and all sufficient authoritie of the supreme doctor of his church in that hee speaketh in his owne name whereby hee putteth a plaine difference betweene himselfe and all other his ministers either prophets apostles or ordinarie teachers for they must not propound any thing vnto god people in their owne names but in the name of christ but christ teacheth in his owne name being the fountaine of all diuine knowledge and vnderstanding that i reuealed in the word of god and thus christ himselfe speaketh in his owne name to strike the hearts of the angell of this church and the better part thereof with reuerence and to mooue them to receiue and obey the counsell following considering it comes immediately from christ the doctor of the church ii point the parties to whom he speaketh to you that is the angell and the better part of this church for so christ expounds it in the words following though first hee say in generall to you that is the rest of them of thyatira when as christ will behaue himselfe as the doctor and chiefe angell of this church note that he maketh a distinction of the persons in the church and also deuideth his counsell giuing one doctrine and one iudgement to one part and a diverse doctrine and iudgement to another this giueth vs good direction for sundry actions for some may aske how must doctrine bee deliuered in a mixt congregation where some are papists some protestant some are hardened others despaire answer the persons must bee distinguished after the example of christ and sutable doctrines deuided for them that euery one may haue his due impenitent sinners must be terrified and threatenings deliuered against them with exception of them that repent comforts must be propounded and applied to them that despaire with restraint from all impenitent persons that goe on in sinne if any demaund more particularly who these bee whom christ calleth the rest of them of thyatyra christ answeres directly as the words import to as many as haue not this learning neither haue knowne the deepenesse of sathan where christ giueth two notes whereby to discerne who bee the rest of them of thyatira the first is the not receiuing or maintaining of the false doctrine of iezabell whereof entreatie hath beene formerly made the second note is ignorance in the deepenesse of sathan neither haue knowne the deepenesse of sathan that is neither haue acknowledged nor approoued the doctrine of iezabell which is the deepe and profound learning as themselues doe iudge in this obserue a most wicked practise of iezabell and her followers they esteemed highly of their owne opinions calling them profound and deepe learning but for the doctrine of the prophets and apostles in the old and new testaments in it there was no such matter this in all ages hath beene the practise of wicked persons highly to esteeme their owne conceits and basely to neglect the word of god the teachers of the iewes doe hold to this day that the lord gaue to moses a most plain and easie law which he deliuered to his people but the most secret and profound doctrine was vnwritten shewed to moses by reuelation and by him deliuered to the priests and leuites which they keepe still in their cabbala and of the like iudgement touching scripture are the popish churches the word written is but an inkie word a dead letter or a nose of waxe but the most perfect scripture is vnwritten which is the consent of faith and of doctrine in the hearts of all catholickes and by such great tearmes the anabaptists libertines and arrians maintaine their doctrine and abuse scripture calling the written word milke for euery nouice but the consent of heart among themselues with reuelations that is the strong meates yes this opinion hath crept in among vs in part man thinke basely of scripture and preferre other mens writings before it for let a man preach plainely the bare word of god and deliuer doctrines and exhortations out of the same this is but plaine preaching but let another come and vtter his mind partly in latine and partly in greeke and other languages alleadging withall the testimonies of fathers counsels and other writers that is the learned preaching and thus doe most man abase scripture and exalt the writings of man aboue it but seeing this is the practise of iezabell and wicked man let vs on the contrary learne to reuerence the written word and giue place thereto aboue all the testimonies and sayings of man whatsoeuer the deepenesse of sathan as if he should say they count it deepe learning but it is the learning of the deuill wherein you may see his profound craft and pollicie where note that when christ will alleadge the speech of iezabell and her followers hee doth it with disgrace vnto them for they counted their doctrine deepe learning but christ repeating their opinion calleth it the deepenesse of sathan hence i gather that christians cannot safely act and play the comedies of heathen man for they are full of many blasphemous speeches and oathes flat against the word of god which they ought not to repeat but with disgrace vnto them for christs practise must bee a patterne for our imitation hee would not repeat so much as one word of a wicked woman without some note of disgrace if it bee sayd they repeat these speeches with disgrace and dislike i answere it is not so for if they did that would take away the whole comedie being full of such bad speeches and this i take to bee the equitie of god word thus to reason from christs example as they speake these words christ addeth first to shew that the words going before were not his owne but the words of iezabels followers touching her doctrine secondly to shew the proud and presumptuous minds of heretickes in maintaining their wicked opinions thus haue false teachers vpheld their errours by proud and swelling words as iude the and pet the pure word of god is not so maintained but in the humilitie and lowlinesse of spirit and in the practise of pietie from an humble heart for god teacheth the lowly his wayes and giueth grace to the humble psalm and therefore this is a note of false doctrin by swelling words to maintaine the same hitherto we haue spoken of the preface before christs counsell now followeth the counsell it selfe in this sentence though i lay no other burden vpon you yet i would haue you to hold fast that which you haue alreadie till i come this sentence is a distinction containing two parts first in these words i will lay no other burden vpon you than that which you haue alreadie that is howsoeuer i threaten my iudgements vnto iezabell and her followers yet i will lay none other punishment vpon you but my reproofe onely for suffering iezabell among you with her false doctrine and followers this braunch of this distinction containeth a most comfortable instruction namely that all those that giue themselues to maintaine puritie of doctrine and synceritie of life shall be safely preserued in the time of common iudgements vnder the blessed protection of god so farre forth as is for god glorie and their good and considering this mercie is offered to the godly wee must hereby learne to become followers of this church of thyatira that is we must endeuour to maintaine the pure truth of god holy word and withall haue care to shew foorth synceritie of manners in making conscience of euery sinne and endeuoring our selues to walke in all the wayes of god commaundements with cheerefulnesse hereby we shall get protection from common iudgements when they are layed vpon the wicked but if wee partake with the wicked in their sinnes wee shall receiue part in their plagues the second part of this distinction is in these words but that which you haue alreadie hold fast till i come that is mine apostles haue deliuered vnto you the pure and sound doctrine of saluation now i charge you that you hold that fast and maintaine it vntill i come to iudgement here is a plaine and most excellent commaundement containing speciall instruction mee for this church of thyatira and all churches before our sauiour christ had commended this church for not approouing the doctrine of iezabell and her company but here hee giueth them another commaundement to hold fast the true doctrine of christ taught them by his apostles wherby he would teach them and in them all churches to content themselues with the pure doctrin of the apostles and not to affect or approoue any other doctrine besides whatsoeuer according as paule biddeth the galatians gal though wee or an angell from heauen preach vnto you any other doctrine than that which we haue preached vnto you let him be accursed by the light of this commaundement wee are directed in sundry duties first not to regard vnwritten traditions which the church of rome doth so highly magnifie for it cannot bee prooued that the apostles euer taught them secondly not to regard the doctrines of man which some bring vnto vs vnder colour of reuelation from god since the apostles times thirdly hereby wee learne what to thinke and iudge of the three great religions of the turkes the iewes and papists at this day the turkish religion is not to bee regarded for it had it beginning sixe hundred yeares after the apostles time with whose doctrine onely we must content our selues also the iewish religion wee must not regard for they reiect the doctrine of the apostles and the religion of the papists we must renounce because it is not of the apostles teaching but had it beginning by little and little long after their times if this commaundement were safely kept which is laid on this church man would not bee of so many religions but all would bee of one religion cleauing fast to the doctrine of the apostles and contenting themselues with it which is the true rule for reformation of life and the right way to attaine saluation lastly here is a rule and direction for those which will bee of no religion because of the diuersitie of opinions touching the same they must haue recourse to the doctrine of the apostles and content themselues therewith nothing regarding new doctrines bee they neuer so glorious till i come here christ sheweth how long the doctrine of the apostles must bee held fast namely not for a short time but till his second comming to iudgement whereby wee learne that it is the dutie of god church to preserue and maintaine the puritie of true religion vnto the end of the world this is no small matter but a most needfull dutie enioyned vnto vs by speciall commaundement and withall a matter of great consequence for the puritie of religion is the foundation and marke of the church and the right way to direct mens soules to eternall life for this cause paule chargeth timothie tim amp to keepe the true patterne of wholesome words and to continue in the things which hee had learned and in regard of this dutie the church is called the pillar and ground of truth and christ for this cause gaue to his church both pastors and teachers pastors to instruct in righteousnesse for the maintenance of puritie in manners and teachers to maintaine the puritie of doctrine in soundnesse of iudgement this therefore must admonish vs that we haue care not onely to learne religion in our owne persons but also to convey the same to ages following that the puritie thereof may bee preserued to the comming of christ this dutie especially concernes the preachers of the gospell they should teach the truth and confute errours and beat downe false doctrines which poyson the truth of god if in the night season a man set vp a false light in the hauen all the ship that are comming to land are in danger of shipwrack so in god church if the bright light of pure religion bee not set vp and aduaunced the soules of man are cast into the gulfe of hell the want of care in performing this dutie is the cause why god sends heresies and apostacies into his church thus came in the apostacie of antichrist thess because man loued not the truth and i no doubt will the lord deale with vs if we haue not care to maintaine the puritie of apostolicall doctrine verse for hee that ouercommeth and keepeth my workes vnto the end to him will i giue power ouer nation and he shall rule them with a rod of iron and as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken euen as i receiued of my father so will i giue him the morning starre let him that hath an eare heare what the spirit sayth to the churches here is the conclusion of this epistle which containeth two parts first a promise verse secondly a commaundement verse in the promise note two things the parties to whom it is made and the benefit promised the parties to whom are euery one that ouercommeth whom christ describeth by a propertie of syncere obedience to keepe his workes vnto the end here then we haue a description of true obedience first the forme thereof consisteth in obseruing the workes of christ which we must not vnderstand of doing them according to the rigor of the law but of a purpose and indeuour to keepe them for this is a priuiledge belonging to all that are in christ that god accepteth their wils and indeuours of obedience for perfect obedience it selfe this we must know and hold for truth for many haue but little knowledge and thereupon are driuen to despaire yet they must know for their comfort that if they haue care to get more knowledge and make conscience to obey that which they know then they are keepers of the workes of christ and shall haue the reward promised secondly obedience is here described by the obiect or matter thereof to wit the workes of christ that is all such workes as christ hath ordained in his word and those whereof he is the author by his spirit in his members hereby we learne first that he that will obey god in christ iesus must not thinke his owne thoughts speake his owne words nor do his owne deeds but he must thinke speake amp do that which christ would haue him secondly that no worke is or can bee acceptable to christ but that which is ordained by him isay isa complaineth of them that would teach the feare of god by mens commandements so that there is no true feare of god but that which is taught by god commaundements and the like may bee sayd of all other our obedience this rule ouerthroweth all other religions besides the true religion as of the iewes turkes and papists for almost all their workes are of mens inuenting and were neuer ordained by christ such are most points in popery as saying of masse going on pilgrimage fastings vowing and praying to saints ampc thirdly whereas he aith my workes meaning not one or two but all his workes we learne that true obedience consisteth in doing all the workes of christ for christ and the diuel will neuer part stakes god must either haue all our workes or none and therefore dauid saith i shall not be confounded because psalm i haue respect vnto all thy commandements and good king iosia is comm nded for that he turned to the lord according to ki all the law of moses this point must be learned of al for many thinke if they doe many good things with mat herod all is well and for this cause many a man abhors couetousnesse and pride and yet is a contemner of the gospell but true obedience must bee in all things vnto the end here is the fourth branch of true obedience it is constant that obedience which christ will reward must not be for a day or a yeare but from time to time through the whole course of our life to the end of our dayes and thus wee must iudge of obedience not by some particular actions but by the whole tenour of a mans life put case a man hath made conscience of all his wayes through the whole course of his life and yet in sicknesse by reason of the extremitie thereof is distracted and raueth blaspheming god and so dieth what must wee iudge of this man surely we must not censure him by his behauiour in his sicknesse but consider what hath beene th enour of his life if that haue beene vpright then his obedience was good and shall bee rewarded ii point the benefits promised and they are two the first is power to rule verse and he shall rule them with a rod of iron and as the vessels of a potter shall they bee broken euen as i receiued of my father the second is the morning starre verse where note by the way that these words euen as i haue receiued of my father are referred amisse in our english translation to the giuing of the morning starre when as they properly belong to the former words in this sence as i haue receiued power ouer nation of my father so will i giue to him that ouercommeth power to rule with the rod of iron ampc now come to the benefits first here is promised by christ a power to rule ouer nation christ power as he is mediator is very great and here it is set foorth by three arguments borrowed from the second psalme verse first by the largenesse of it i reacheth not to one country alone but to all country and to all man in all nation secondly by the soueraigntie of it christs power is absolute in ruling and ouerruling and this his soueraigntie consisteth in two things first in making lawes vnto the consciences of man so as if they be not kept hee may iustly condemne them and in ouerruling the wils of all man conforming them to his will will they nill they which is signified by this he shall rule rule them with a rod of iron secondly in that hee hath this absolute power in himselfe to saue and to destroy and therefore is sayd to haue reu the keyes of heauen and hell which is signified in the next words and as the vessell of a potter shall they be broken thirdly by the fountaine of it christ receiueth this power from his father indeed as christ is god he is equall with his father and hath this power of himselfe but as he is mediator his power is giuen him of his father mat for the better vnderstanding of this place two questions must bee handled first how farre foorth doth christ giue this his power vnto man answer christs soueraigne and generall power ouer the whole world is not indeed giuen to any creature nay it is incommunicable and cannot bee conueyed from the person of christ to the person of any creature man or angell this truth wee must hold of all christs offices they are onely in the person of christ and cannot passe from him to any other ii quest how then doth christ say truly that hee will giue him that ouercommeth power ouer nation answer not that his soueraigne power is actually giuen to the creature but because the creature being in christ hath the fruit amp benefit of this power in his saluation and this power is in them two wayes first hereby christ makes all his servant being his mebers partakers of his glorie in heauen whereas the whole world besides is condemned in hell and therefore we are sayd to ephesians be raised vp together and made to sit together in the heauenly places in christ iesus and againe he saith the corinthian saints shall iudge the world not i giuing sentence vpon them but as witnesses and approuers of christ his sentence for the elect shall first receiue the sentence of absolution and then beeing taken vp into the clouds shall sit with christ and there approue of the iust condemnation of all the wicked secondly by this power he enableth those that bee his in their owne person to ouercome all the enemy of their saluation his meaning then is this as if he had sayd howsoeuer my soueraigne power ouer all creatures in my selfe cannot bee deriued to any other yet by vertue of this my power i will exalt them that ouercome to partake of my glorie and will giue them power in themselues ouer their sinnes ouer death hell the world and all the enemy of their saluation here then behold vnto what exceeding dignitie euerie true servant of god is aduanced not in himself but in christ he hath rule ouer nation and victorie ouer all the enemy of his saluation yes he is made partaker of christs glory hence we are taught to make conscience of euerie sinne whatsoeuer for the priuiledge of euerie christian is to haue power to iudge the wicked world now as it is a shame for a iudge that sitteth and condemneth a murtherer or a theefe to be a theefe or a murtherer himselfe so it is for any christian to liue in any one sin seeing hee himselfe must condemne the world of those sinnes neither can we thinke that christ will euer aduance him that liues in sinne to condemne the same in others vnlesse hee first reforme it in himselfe secondly the consideration of this priuiledge of a christian must bee hid in our minds against the time of aduersitie and affliction and of the pangs of death for hee that hath kept faith and good conscience all his life is a prince in iesus christ and shall rule ouer all his enemy and therefore though now he bee afflicted and wronged by them yet in christ he is their iudge and shall one day condemne them that do him wrong and as for death it is subdued in christ and shall bee no death vnto him corin verse againe the words in the originall are thus he shall feede and rule the nation as a shepheard ruleth and feedeth his lambes with his booke the papists vpon the words of christ to peter john feed my sheepe that is feede and rule my sheepe would gather peters supremacie ouer the church in all the world but their grosse abuse of that place will appeare by comparing it with this prom se of christ to euery one that ouercommeth for if their collection be good then hence will follow that euery christian man should haue the like supremacie and be a pope which how absurd it is euery man may iudge therfore that place in john must not be vnderstood of any supremacie for there christ teacheth peter the faithfull discharge of his office and dutie from this first gift of christ the papists gather two things i that the seuerall saints in heauen are patrons of country amp kingdomes as saint george for england saint de is for fraunce saint patricke for ireland ampc secondly that wee may pray vnto saints for the saints rule the nation and therefore know all nation and if they know them then they must bee prayed vnto but they swar e from the meaning of this text for first it is not sayd that the saints shall haue power one ouer one countrey and another ouer another but euery saint hath power ouer al nation secondly they haue power ouer all nation not because they rule them actually but because they haue the fruit and benefit of christs power wherby they are ruled and for their second collection wee must by nation vnderstand not all churches but vnbeleeuers for the wicked are they that must be broken like po ters vessels now the faithfull haue not power ouer the churches but ouer infidel amp therfore both their collections are absurd i will giue him the mor ng starre here is the second benefit promised by christ to him that ouercommeth the morning starre properly signifieth that bright star which riseth a little before the sun some time of the yeare which the heathen call venus and hereby is ment christ himselfe as reu i am the bright morning starre christ is called a star first because he illuminateth all man with the light of vnderstanding and his church with the knowledge of the will of his father and that sufficiently in all matters that concerne saluation secondly to shewe that the prophesie vttered by balaam touching christ whom he calleth number the star of iaacob is now fulfilled when as christ by his apostles hath plentifully reuealed himselfe to all nation further he is called a morning starre for that special resemblance which is betweene him and it for the morning star riseth not in the beginning or middle of the night but in the end of the night towards the beginning of the day when the sun is about to rise and then it shineth brighter than all other starres euen so christ he came not in the beginning or middle of the darke time vnder the law but in the last age of the world wherin after his incarnation he did shine most fully to all nation so as there was no such light of knowledge before his comming as hath bene since this peter verifieth when he saith pet we haue a most sure word of the prophets to which ye do well that ye take heed as vnto a light that shineth in a darke place vntill the day d wne and the day starre arise in your hearts where the time of the law and prophets is called a time of darknesse and their preaching then as a candlelight but the preaching of christ vnder the gospell is as the day starre which shineth most brightly he is not called the morning star because hee shineth to al the world in al time as the morning star doth but because he shineth vnto man in the last age of the world it is further sayd i will giue him it where is promised fellowship and participation with christ a hee is this day starre and herein are two benefits comprised first perfect illumination wherby ignorance shall be wholly taken away after this life when as man shall know god fully so farre foorth as a creature can know the creator secondly the light of perfect glory for by fellowship with christ wee shall bee made to shine as the starres as daniel daniel speaketh yes wee shall become column saints in light s the apostle sayth whereas christ compares himselfe to the morning starre first wee see the grosse errour of many among vs who liue in blindnesse of mind and ignorance walking in their wicked lusts and pleasures without care of keeping faith or good conscience and yet persuade themselues that they haue part in christ and shall bee partakers of his light and glorie but they are deceiued for all such as liue in blind ignorance and in sinne are meere darkenesse and so can haue no fellowship with christ who is that bright morning starre for what fellowship can bee betweene light and darkenesse this bright morning starre serueth onely for them that receiue the light thereof and walke by it but those that walke in the darkenes of their sinnes haue no benefit by it secondly seeing christ is this morning starre wee must haue care to learne peters instruction namely labour that this bright starre may rise and shine in our hearts this wee shall feele when we vse those meanes wherby the beames of this starre may shine vpon vs not onely for the enlightening of our minds but also for the heating and reuiuing of our frozen and dead hearts for as the sun in the spring time quickeneth by it warme beames some things that lye dead all winter so christ iesus this morning starre by the beames of his grace doth enlighten our minds and reuiue our dead and frozen hearts and till such time as wee feele these things wrought in vs we cannot say that this morning starre is risen vnto vs or hath shone into our hearts thirdly whereas christ appeareth in the morning when darkenesse is past wee are hereby taught to lead our liues in godlinesse righteousnesse sobrietie and in all manner of vpright and godly conuersation for the night is past and the day is come wherein wee may see to walke vprightly and therefore wee must cast off the vnprofitable workes of darkenesse as the apostle exhorteth vs rom and know this that those who in this light doe not walke accordingly but delight in sinnes the workes of darkenesse shall one day haue their fill hee that loueth the darke for the hiding of his talent must bee cast for his reward into vtter darkenesse let him that hath an eare to heare heare what the spirit sayth vnto the churches here is christs commaundement the second part of this conclusion but hereof we haue spoken before motiues to proceed these words containe the fift particular commandement of our sauiour christ vnto john wherein he is inioyned to write amp send a speciall epistle to the church of god in sardis of this commandement we haue spoken before the epistle it self is contained in the sixe first verses amp it hath three parts a preface the matter of the epistle amp the conclusio the preface in these words these things saith he which hath the seuen spirits of god and the seuen starres in this preface first is set downe in whose name this epistle is written to procure authoritie vnto it it is in christs name whose soueraigntie is described by two royalties that is by two prerogatiues or priuiledges belonging to him as he is a soveraigne king of his church the first is the hauing of the seuen spirits of god the second his hauing of the seuen starres for the first royaltie in the first chap verse i shewed that by seuen spirits were meant the holy ghost from whom proceed all the gifts and graces that any man enioy and therefore whereas christ is said to haue the seuen spirits of god the meaning is that he hath the holy ghost and this is a royaltie of christ as he is the king and head of his church if it be said that other servant of god as dauid peter and paul had the holy ghost answer it is true but not in the same manner with christ for he hath the holy ghost two wayes in regard of his diuine nature amp of his manhood as christ is god hee is the beginning of the holy ghost for the holy ghost is a person in the trinitie proceeding from the son as well as from the father in regard of which proceeding christ is sayd to send the holy ghost and to doe whatsoeuer hee doth by the holy ghost as to ouercome death by the eternall spirite and to rise from death to life secondly as christ is man he hath the holy ghost because the holy ghost powred into him the perfection of all graces and giftes whatsoeuer and for this cause he is said to be psalm anoynted with the oyle of gladnesse aboue his fellowes and to be inriched with the perfection of all graces and that two wayes both for number and degrees for number with man some haue some graces and some man others but christ hee hath the graces of all man and all angels nay moe graces in number then all man and all angels haue and as they are in number perfect so they are perfect in degree for in measure they exceed the graces of all creatures man or angels and therefore the father is said to haue giuen the spirit vnto his son john without measure amp thus much is meant by this first royaltie of christ now the end why christ is said to haue the holy ghost is to shewe that hee is a most liuely head of his church who is filled with plentie of all store of graces whereby he is able to inrich his church and to reuiue the members thereof who are dead in their sinnes and such indeed was the speciall state of this church first hence we learne no man can haue true fellowship with the holy ghost but by christ it is manifest that none can haue fellowship with the father but by christ and here the same is verified touching fellowship with the holy ghost especially for the obtaining of those graces that concerne eternall life this serueth for our speciall instruction for among the papists there are many that haue worthy and excellent gifts of god as knowledge memorie ampc and yet in them be wanting the special giftes of the spirit as faith which iustifieth amp regeneration for touching assurance of these in themselues they professe themselues to be ignorant and whence cometh this but onely from their want of christ for the christ of the papists as they teach him is an idoll christ and therefore wee are not to maruell though wee see the most learned among them to scoffe and mock at our doctrin of assurance of faith amp certainty of electio secondly we haue many among vs that will say they looke to be saued by christ amp to haue their sins pardoned by him and yet you shall perceiue in them no grace of knowledge or conscience of true obedience but these things canot stand together to wit loosnes of life and forgiuenes of sins amp therfore these man deceiue themselues for if they had christ they should haue his spirit and the graces thereof purging their hearts for christ and his spirit are neuer seuered he that hath the spirit of christ working in him faith amp good conscience hath an infallible token that iesus christ is his this must admonish vs to labour for vnion with christ iesus our head to become flesh of his flesh amp bone of his bone that in him we may haue fellowship with the father and with the holy ghost for till we be vnited vnto christ we shall neuer haue the graces of saluation wrought effectually in our hearts the second royaltie of christ is that he hath the seuen starres that is the seuen pastors of the seuen churches of asia they are called starres because in their ministerie they inlighten man in the way that leadeth vnto life and christ is said to haue them because hee is a soueraigne lord ouer them amp they bee his servant for he ppointeth that person that shall be his minister among man hee giueth him gifts meet for his calling he prescribeth also vnto him his office and duties but the pastors of churches will some say are made by the church answer the right of ordaining pastors belongs to christ as his royaltie the office of the church is to testifie ratifie amp according to the word of god to approoue of them whom christ maketh and indueth with gifts and for that cause is the church said to call and ordaine ministers the end why christ is said to haue soveraigntie ouer the ministers is to strike the heart of the minister of this church of sardis with conscience of his former negligence amp to stir him vp to diligence and carefulnes in his place and indeede the consideration of christs soueraigntie ouer them is an excellent motiue to stir vp all ministers to bee diligent in their place and so likewise all christians for considering that they are christs and the gifts they haue come from him this must mooue them to make conscience of all good duties for being christs they must giue themselues wholy to do the will of christ whose they are if he would haue vs liue we must be thankefull because he is lord of life if our death will glorifie him we must be content because wee are his thus much of the preface the matter of this epistle containeth two parts a reproofe of a vice with the remedie thereof verse and a praise or commendation verse the reproofe in these words i know thy works that is i know all thy workes they are all manifest vnto me and i mislike of them so must these wordes be vnderstood in this place as may appeare by the reason of this reproofe in the wordes following thou hast a name that thou liuest but thou article dead wherein is set downe the fault of this church namely hypocrisie for that they pretended christian religion in outward profession but yet wanted the life of christianitie amp the power of godlines for the meaning of the reason is this thou hast a name that thou liuest that is churches round about thee iudge and speak of thee as of a church that is borne anew in christ and is guided by his spirit for by life we must vnderstand spirituall life not corporall but yet for all this thou article dead that is thou wantest true spirituall life by regeneration and article indeed dead in thy sinnes this is a great and a sharpe reproofe that which is here said of this church of sardis may be truly verified of diverse churches in this age as first of the great church of rome who are guided by the pope as by their head that church hath a name to be aliue amp in their owne pretence it is the only true church of god in the world but in truth and before god it is dead some say it is as a body full of diseases and whose throat is cut but yet the heart panteth amp life remaineth therin but we may say it hath no manner of spirituall life but lyeth starke dead as a carkasse in the graue the reasons that some alledge for it are of small moment first they say it hath the sacramet of baptisme which is a note of a true church and therefore it hath some life ans first baptisme is not alwayes a note of a true church for circumcision in whose stead commeth baptisme was a sacrament vsed of the samaritans when they were se no people of god and so no church of god againe baptisme without the true preaching of the gospel is no infallible signe of a church it is but a seale pulled from the writing or set to a bare paper to no vse and further outward baptisme without inward baptisme is no note of a church but such is baptisme in the church of rome it hath not inward baptisme ioyned vnto it neither the true preaching of the word for the doctrine which they teach is a quite ouerturning of christ and his gospel and therefore outward baptisme may bee where there is no church secondly i answer that baptisme in the church of rome is a sacrament not to their synagogue but to the hidde church of god among them for god had his church among them euen in the midst of popery there were alwayes some among them that renounced their religion whom god called home vnto himself by the meanes which were among them as the vse of this sacrament the apostles creed and of other books of holy scripture for as god said to elijah in ahabs time kin i haue reserued seuen thousand that neuer bowed the knee to baal so may it bee sayd of many among the papists god hath there his secret church who neuer yeelded to the popes gouernment and doctrine second reason antichrist say they sitteth in the thess temple of god now the temple of god is god church amp therfore the church of rome is god church answer he sitteth there not as a member thereof but as an vsurper and deceiuer for in the church of popery is the hidden church of god they are therein mingled as a little wheat with much chaffe and as little gold with much drosse so that though the church of god be where antichrist sitteth yet the church whereof hee is head is no church of god for whether we regard their doctrin or worship of god there is no meanes to beget or preserue spirituall life in their church further this which christ sayth of sardis may be sayd not onely of the papists but of the churches of the protestant as of this our church of england amp of the most congregations in the great townes thereof though not for doctrine yet in regard of mens conuersations for the body of our people seeme to be aliue by their outward profession but indeed they are dead in respect of the power of godlinesse for by occasion of outward peace these sins abound fulnes of bread pride both inward in heart amp outward in attyre also cruelty couetousnes amp carnal security like as it was in noahs time now where these sins raigne there the power of godlines is wanting man content theselues with an outward profession but the spiritual life of grace is not to be seen and yet this doth not preiudice the state of our church to nullifie it from being the church of god for god hath his chosen among vs in all places who liue indeed a spirituall life thogh the body of our people be dead in amp so will continue while peace abideth the threatnings of the ministers wil not awake me out of the sleepe of sin it must be the rod of correctio that must put into them the power of religion man are like to little children who besides admonition must feele the smart of the rod to bring them to their dutie further in this church of sardis whom christ calleth dead though they had a name to liue note the state of the church of god for this was a true church of god who among the rest was washed in the blood of christ chap verse and yet christ saith it is dead in sinne that is in part not wholly and therfore a church that is in a very corrupt state both in regard of outward conuersation and of sundry erronious opinions may yet remaine the true church of christ if so be they erre not in the foundation which serueth for answere to them that thinke our church to bee no church because it maintaineth not that out ward order which they thinke should be in it and therefore though wee must preferre church before church yet we must not condemne a church to bee no church for some corruptions that bee therein a true body may haue some blemish and a true church some wants againe the churches of god say this is a church yet christ saith they are dead how can these two stand answer the churches about sardis iudged this to be aliue according to the rule of charitie because of their outward profession of true religion for as infants are not indeede all holy as experience sheweth yet till wee see the same made manifest wee are in charitie to iudge them to bee holy that are borne of f ithfull parents euen so ought the minister and euery one in god church to thinke the best of euery one in god church till god make manifest what hee is paul following this rule calleth whole churches elect but thou article dead here are two iudgements one of neighbour churches the other of christ and christs iudgement is preferred wee must therefore regard specially the iudgement of christ and labor to approue our selues amp our conuersations vnto christ rather then to man for let man say what they will of vs it is christ that must saue and condemne this made corinthian paul to say i passe little to bee iudged of you or of mans iudgement why so for hee that iudgeth mee is the lord and indeed without christs commendation the iudgement of man is nothing for christ may condemne vs when man thinke well and speake well of vs and therefore hee saith woe bee vnto you when all man speake well of you luke there be two degrees of hypocrisie first when man professe that which is not in their heart at all the second when man make profession of more then is in their heart this second kind of hypocrisie oft befalleth the children of god and it is that which christ reprooueth in this church of sardis in the former verse after which reproofe here he propoundeth a remedie to their vice and a reason to mooue them to vse the same the remedie is in the beginning of the verse where are two duties prescribed to bee watchfull and to strengthen or confirme the decayed graces of god in them for the first be watchfull to bee watchfull here is a most worthy and excellent dutie it is not bodily but spirituall and it is practised when any man hath a circumspect care and diligent heed in respect of the saluation of his soule this dutie of watchfulnesse concerneth two things sinne and death watchfulnes against sinne stands in two duties first a man must daily and continually bethinke himselfe before hand of all sinnes and vices into which he may happily fall amp for the doing of this he must consider in himselfe two hings his nature and his calling touching his nature he must consider that in him remaines the seed and roote of all sin and therefore that hee may fall into any sinne whatsoeuer againe a man considering his nature shall finde himselfe more inclined to some sinnes then to others and those hee must especially marke and obserue secondly for his calling a man must marke the sinnes thereof for since the fall of man euery calling hath his especiall sins wherto man that walke therein are more incident the magistrate hath his sins the minister his the lawyer his the physition his and the trade man his and touching these a man must consider vnto what vices and abuses man are most subiect that walke in that calling wherein he liueth and so shal he haue a foresight of the sinnes that he may fall into secondly after this foresight of sin he must watch his heart with all diligence that though it bee tempted and assaulted yet it bee not tainted with any one sin as the wise man counselleth pro keepe thy heart with all diligence that so the fountaine of al thy actions may be kept holy and pure the second part of this watchfulnesse respecteth death or the second comming of christ in this two things must bee practised first a man must euery day bethinke him selfe of his ende and of the comming of christ either in generall to all the world or particularly vnto him by death and in this consideration he must esteem and iudge of euery day as of the day of his death or the day of iudgement secondly he must prepare himselfe against death amp against the day of iudgement euery day eue this present day as though hee should now die or meete christ in iudgement and the next day do the like and so goe on continually to the day of his death and for our furtherance in this christian watch we must be mindefull of temperance and sobrietie that we keepe mediocritie in the vse of the creatures of god and of the things of this life for when man plunge themselus either in the cares of this world or in earthly delights they quite forget both sinne and death and the day of iudgement and thus wee see what christ meaneth by watchfulnesse as christ prescribeth this dutie vnto this church so are we in the name of christ to bee enioyned the same christian watchfulnesse both against sinne and death and the day of iudgement and to mooue vs hereto consider these reasons first wee are watchfull for the preseruation of the things of this life as if a towne be in danger of sacking or burning there is watch and ward kept continually and if a mans house bee in danger of robbing hee will sit vp night and day to saue his goods yes euery man is verie painfull and watchfull to heape vp to himselfe the things of this world now what a shame is it that man should bee watchfull for temporall things and yet haue no care of their soule that must liue for euer againe want of watchfulnesse is the forerunner of death and eternall destruction i thess verse when man say peace and safetie then shall come vpon them sudden destruction when the rich man had enlarged his barnes vpon the encrease of his substance he promised to himselfe case and securitie saying uk soule soule take thy rest ampc but it was sayd vnto him oh foole this night shal thy soule be taken from thee and the mat old world knew nothing till the flood came and destroyed them all now if the want of watchfulnesse bee the forerunner of destruction how great a cause haue wee to watch the second dutie inioyned is to confirme the graces of god decaied in them strengthen the thinges which remaine that are readie to die as if hee should say sundry be the graces which i haue bestowed on you but many are lost and gone and those which remain are about to perish vnlesse you confirme them therefore see nowe that you strengthen and repaire the same in this dutie christ teacheth this church and vs an excellent lesson that whosoeuer hath receiued any gift of god must haue care to preserue it and to make the same gift strong in him by continuall increase if a man haue receiued knowledge faith and repentance or any other gift of grace he must not suffer the same to lye dead in him but stirre vp increase and confirme it dayly that hee may bee a perfect man in christ for the gifts which man haue are not their owne but god also who looketh to receiue his owne with aduantage and therefore man like good stewards must so vse the gifts receiued that they may returne them to god with increase thus paul perswadeth timothy tim stirre vp the gift of god that is in thee for else the receiuer is an vnfaithfull servant and so shall be rewarded and for the better perfourmance of this dutie we must often read the word of god and meditate therein we must heare it often preached and with due reuerence and preparation receiue the sacrament and pray continually striuing earnestly against the corruptions that bee in vs and dayly stirring vp our heart to all good duties thus did dauid checke the corruption and deadnesse of his heart ps why article thou so cast downe oh my soule and also stirre vp the same vnto all good duties saying i haue applyed my heart to fulfill thy statutes alway euen to the end ps hereby are reprooued the common sort of professors amp hearers of the word who stand at a stay and goe not forward in grace this is a great fault for as we haue receiued grace so we ought to stirre vp the same that we may confirme and increase it dayly further christ addeth which are about to die where he answereth to a question that is mooued by sundry at this day namely whether graces that concerne saluation may be vtterly lost or not christ answeareth by a distinction that some graces that pertaine to saluation may be lost quite and others may be decayed so as they are about to die for the graces of god that pertaine to saluation be of two sorts some be absolutely necessarie so as without them a man of yeares cannot be saued and such are faith and regeneration others bee lesse necessary which sometime goe with faith but not alwaies such are a plentifull feeling of the fauour of god ioy in the holy ghost and boldnesse in prayer these may be lost wholy for a time in the servant of god yes faith and regeneration themselues may decay greeuously and be readie to di as this text saith secondly consider fayth and regeneration in themselus and they may be wholly lost for nothing in it selfe is vnchangeable but god the state of the elect angels by nature is changeable for they stand by the power of god thirdly these graces may perish and decay finally vnlesse thy bee confirmed question why then doe not the elect finally fall away after their calling ans their standing cometh not from the constancie of grace or faith but from the promise of god made vnto them amp to their faith so christ saith to peter at thou article peter and vpon this rocke that is vpon thy faith which thou hast professed will i build my temple and the gates of hell shall not preuaile against it that is though they may assault it and greeuously weaken it yet they shall neuer bee able finally to ouercome it seing sundry graces of god may be lost and the most necessary graces greatly decay yes of themselues quite die wee that haue receiued from god any grace either of faith or repentance are hereby taught not to bee presumptuous or ouer confident in our selus but with feare and trembling worke out our saluation phillip the reason to enforce the former remedie is this for i haue not found thy workes perfect before god and therefore watch and confirme the decayed graces of god that be in thee in this reason christ giueth the amp vs to vnderstand that he maketh a search in his church of al the works that man doe in the same that he may accordingly reward them for not finding doth presuppose a search and so the scripture speaketh of god vsually before the old world was destroyed it is sayd the gen lord saw that the wickednesse of man was great vppon the earth as if he had looked from heauen vpon the earth and beheld that it was corrupt speaking after the manner of man to signifie that search which he maketh into mens actions and so he is sayd to come down from heauen at the building of babell gen and before he destroyed sodome and gomorrha gen he came downe to see whether they had done according to that crie which was come vp to him and so before the lord punished the wickednes of the israelits ierem he made a search into their wai and the second commaundement is this god will visite the sinnes of the father vpon the children that is he will make a search whether the sinnes of the fathers be among the children and if they be he will punish them seing christ makes this search into all mens actions we are taught in all things to haue care to conforme our selus to the will of christ and to set our selues to the doing of all good duties according to his word if we knew a magistrate would come to make search in our house wee would bee sure to set all thinges in order against he came shall we be thus circumspect to prepare for the comming of an earthly man amp shall we not much more prepare our selues against the search of our sauiour christ the euerliuing god from whom nothing can be hid i haue not found thy works perfect works are perfect two waies by the law or by the gospell by the law whe in our works wee doe all that the law requireth and thus are no mans workes perfect in this life by the gospel our works are perfect when they proceed from a belieuing hart that hath a care to please god in all things amp these works are perfect not in theselus but in the acceptation of christ here by perfect works christ meaneth not the perfection of the law but of the gospell as if he had sayd i haue searched into your waies you doe many workes in shew but they proceed not from sincere faith nor from a heart that hath care to please god in all his commandements and a full purpose not to sinne against him you haue a shew of godlynesse but you want the power thereof here obserue that christ condemneth this church not because their works were not outwardlye conformable to the will of god but because they proceeded not from a beleeuing hart that had a full purpose to forsake all sinne and to please god in all things wee therefore must take heede of all hypocrisie by the example of this church and labour to bee of dauids minde and praye with him psalm that our harts may be vpright in the statutes of the lord that wee may say with hezekias isay behold lord how i haue walked before thee with an vpright minde for this is a notable token of grace and an infallible badge of him that is the child of god before god some may say christ here distinguisheth himselfe from god and therefore hee is not god answere by god in this place we must vnderstand not god simply but god the father for christ here speaketh of himselfe not as he is god but as he is mediator god amp man in which respect euen as he is now glorified he is inferiour vnto his father where note that christ being now glorified in heauen carrieth himselfe as mediator whence we gather that we may lawfully and without presumption pray vnto christ without the meanes or intercession of saints or angels the church of rome denie this and say because christ is now in full glorie in heauen therefore wee must vse vnto him the mediation of saints but christ being now in heauen marks our workes in particular and therefore we may without presumption come vnto him by prayer when christ hath reprooued them for their sinne of hypocrisie and prescribed them a remedie with a reason thereof he doth as a good phisitian amp pastor shew them the way how they may practise that remedie for they might say we are commanded to watch and to renew our decayed graces but how shall we doe this christ answereth by doing three things i by remebring that which thou hast receiued by hearing ii by holding fast iii by repenting of thy sinnes for the first remember therefore that is call to mind the doctrine of saluation which thou hast been taught by mine apostles this remembrance is a most excellent means to mooue a man to subiection to god will to repent and to practise all good graces when dauid saw the prosperitie of the wicked his fect had almos steps but his remedie against that temptation was his psalm go g to god sanctuari and there calling to mind the end of those man againe psalm i haue remembred thy name oh lord in the night and haue kept thy law peter denied his master when he forgot his words but when hee was put in mind thereof by the looke of christ and the crowing of a cocke he then repented and wept bitterly luke sinnes committed by man of ignorance are many and grieuous and therfore all sins are called ignorances heb but if man wold by faith keepe in mind the word of god it would bee a notable meanes to keepe them from sinning here then we haue a soueraigne remedie against sinne namely wheresoeuer we are or whatsoeuer we doe we must call to minde the word of god and the promises of god and those will bee a lanterne vnto our steps and a light vnto our paths the diuell laboureth aboue all things to bring vs to forget the word for then he knowes he can easily draw vs into any sin quest how shall we keepe in minde the word and promises of god answer that is a grace of god and for the attayning vnto it we must first labour to haue our hearts affected with the loue of god word and promises for a man can neuer keepe in mind that whereof he hath no liking secondly we must labour to belieue the word of god for faith giues it rooting in our hearts colos the cause why there is so little remembring of that which is taught is for that it is not mixed with faith in those that heare it againe the thing to be remembred is how thou hast receiued and heard that is looke what doctrine thou hast receiued by hearing and that remember where we see christ ioineth receiuing and hearing together whence wee may gather that aching and receiuing of the word of god by hearing is the prescribed generall meanes whereby god reuealeth his will counsell and purpose touching the saluation of mankind neither is there any other meanes appointed hereunto in the word of god this sheweth that their opinion is false who teach that god calleth all he world effectually vnto saluation for how can th y bee called that neuer heard of the of god but all in all ages neuer of the word of god albeit the comming of christ their sound hath gone foorth into all nation secondly this sheweth the fondnesse of their opinion who defend the doctrine of vniuersall grace that god should giue grace pertaining to saluation vnto euerie man in the world so as he may be saued if he will for the meanes to receiue grace is the hearing of the word which all man in all ages neuer had vouchsafed vnto them the second dutie prescribed is the holding fast of this doctrine to hold fast here signifieth two things first to maintaine the doctrine of the gospell receiued and taught by the apostles secondly to put the same in practise in a godly life of these wee haue spoken before cap the third dutie is to repent where by repentance is not meant the beginning of repentance but the renewing and restoring of the same for their hardnesse and deadnesse of heart whereby they did slackly and coldly practise the good duties which they did professe hereby we are taught not to content our selues with the begining of repentance but we must renue the same continually amp that not for grosse sins only but euen for the wants that bee in vs as for our dulnesse and deadnesse of heart and for our hypocrisie and decay in god graces and because this church was verie dead and dull of heart therefore christ addeth a reason to mooue them to the practise of this dutie which is a most terrible threatning in these words if thou wilt not watch i will come on thee a theefe and thou shalt not know what houre i will come vpon thee here marke christs order and dealing hauing prescribed a remedie for their fault hee giueth them a direction to practise the same and after addeth a most terrible threatning to driue them therevnto as if he should say if thou wilt not watch against sinne and against death and for that end remember my word hold fast the same and repent then look as a theefe comes vpon a man on a suddaine and spoyles his goods and cuts the throate of his children so will i come on thee on a suddaine and power vpon thee my wrath whereby i will cut the throat of thy soule and thou shalt haue no means to escape my punishment here christ threatneth suddaine and speedie destruction but yet with condition and limitation of repentance now because we be like this church as hath been shewed by reason of the long peace which we inioy we may also vse the same reason and threatning at this day to stirre vp our dead harts we must watch against all sinne and against death and for this end must haue in memorie the word of god and hold fast the faith vnto the end and repent continually of all wants but if we doe not this then are the vengeances and eternall punishments of god to be powred vpon vs without measure and that sodenly when wee cannot preuent them if a man haue but a sparke of grace the consideration hereof will mooue him to repentance and to watchfulnes but if this will not awake a man out of his sinnes then nothing remaineth but a fearfull expectation of the wrath of god which shall be vnauoidable and endure for euer indeed if a man had some thousand yeares allotted for the punishment of his sins there were some cause why hee might continue in them but seeing this punishment is eternall and when many thousand yeares are expired they are as farre from the end of their woe as euer they were therefore it must stirre vp all dead and drowzie harts vnto repentance and cause them to shake off securitie ignorance and coldnesse in religion and to breake off the course of euerie sinne heere beginneth the second part of the matter of this epistle namely the praise and commendation of some part of this church the words doe thus depend vppon those which went before wheras christ had sayd that this church was dead in sinne and had onely a name to liue some man might a ke how it could bee a true church to this christ answereth in the beginning of this verse that though the greatest part in this church were dead in their sinnes yet some few there were among them that were aliue in christ and did testifie the the same by true and sincere obedience in this coherence we may obserue two instructions i that a particular congregation on earth is made a church of god and so called in regard of god elect therein who doe truely belieue for the priuiledges of a church belong vnto particular congregations onely by reason of the faith of the elect among them the catholick church is the whole company of the elect truly beleuing in christ amp particular congregations are members of it so farre forth as they doe truely beleeue the rest that doe not truely belieue are not members of the church before god but in the iudgement of man like vnto superfluous humors which are in the bodie but no parts thereof this confuteth the doctrine of the church of rome who teach that wicked man that are reiected in god decree may yet bee true members of the church of god secondly in this coherence christ intimateth vnto vs a distinction betweene man and man in this church for all that were in this church were man called professing christ and his gospell and yet of them some were dead in their sinnes and others were aliue in christ touching this distinction of man wee must search the cause thereof it must not be ascribed to any power or will in man but to the good pleasure of god as the scripture teacheth for when the bodie of the israelites had giuen themselues to idolatry there were yet rom seuen thousand that neuer bowed the knee to baall what was the cause why they did not liue like to the other israelites surely nothing in the will of man though the idolatry of the other was to bee ascribed to themselues but the text is cleare it was the good pleasure of god who had preserued and kept them by this wee see how erronious and false the diuinitie of some protestant is which ascribe the cause of this distinction betweene man and man to the libertie of mans will being renewed by grace saying that god giues to euerye man sauing grace by vertue whereof hee maye repent and beleeue if hee will but yet because the will of man doth still remaine sinfull hence it commeth that hee hath libertie to obey or not to obey and therefore the cause why some man lye dead in sinne is because they set their will to refuse the grace of god and the cause why some man liue in christ is because they incline their will to embrace the grace of god but this doctrine doth greatly diminish the grace of god in that it maketh the acceptance thereof to lye and depend on the pleasure and will of man when as the power of almightie god ioyned with his will is the true cause thereof leauing some to themselues who doe fall and enabling others to stand by his grace nowe followe the wordes of this commendation notwithstanding thou hast a fewe names yet in sardie that is there bee yet in this church a fewe persons knowne to mee by their names for by names wee must vnderstand persons named which haue not defiled their garments heere to omit many expositions is an allusion to the ceremoniall law wherein god set downe a distinction betweene thinges cleane and vncleane not in themselues but by his appointment and among the iewes if any man had but touched an vncleane thinge with his hand or with his garment thereby hee was defiled and his garment defiled legally and so he or his garment were reputed vncleane wherevpon they had a speciall care not to touch the thinges that were defiled no not with their garments now this signified another thing vnto them namely that they ought to abstaine not onely from the outward sinnes of the morall lawe but euen from all occasions intentions shewes and appearances of euill and in this place this is meant hereby that some in this church of sardie had so farre made conscience of sinne that they would not meddle with the verie occasions and appearances of euill hereby wee see that the servant of god are but fewe in number for the bodie of this people were de d in sinne and a fewe onely in this great place liued in christ so christ sayth to his disciples the flocke to whome the father luke will giue the kingdome of heauen is but a little flocke the prophet isay is sent isay to harden the hearts of the bodie of the people for th ir iniquities and verse the tenth part onely must bee saued and in the gospell it is sayd the way to hell is broad mat and many there be that walke therein but the waye to heauen is straight and fewe there bee that enter into it hereby then wee are taught not to follow the example of the multitude but of the fewer and better sort it is a foule sinne that keeps many from religion and brings them to destruction when they will liue after the manner of the world and as their forefathers haue done this is a false rule and a dangerous course thou hast a few names that is persons whose names i know amp haue recorded they are called names bicause christ obserues and knowes them by their names where note that those that are the true servant of god are particularly knowne vnto christ uk the haires of your head are numbred sayth christ to his disciples much more were their names knowne againe hee biddeth them reioyce that their names luke were written in heauen and christ the good sheepheard knowes his sheepe and cals them by their names ioh this is a matter of endlesse comfort vnto the people of god for what can cause a man more to reioyce than to knowe that his name particularly is knowne to the king of kings and that accordingly he hath speciall regard vnto him when the lord would comfort moses and put courage into him in doing the duties of his calling hee telleth him that hee was knowne vnto him by xod ad name yes this is the foundation of mans saluation tim the lord knoweth who are his which haue not defiled their garments heere they are commended for vprightnesse and sinceritie of life and conuersation in that they kept themselues from the verie shewes and appearance of euill when as th rest of this church was dead in sinne in their example christ prescribeth vnto vs a patterne of true pietie howe wee ought to carry our selues in the church of god on earth wee must not content our selues with a bare profession of religion and keepe our selues from grosse sinnes only but abstain from the verie shewes of euill yes more particularly here are three things taught vs touching sinne first that wee ought to make conscience of euerie sinne in our owne person secondly that wee ought to keepe our selues from the con agion of sinne in others either by giuing consent vnto them or furthering amp allowing them any way therein thirdly that wee ought to abstaine from the verie occasions and shewes and appearances of sinnes so paul teacheth vs thess to abstaine from all appearance of euill ephesian hee will not haue sundrie sinnes as fornication vncleanesse ampc so much as once named thereby to giue the least approbation vnto them we must therefore looke on this example lay it to our hearts and conforme our liues vnto it so shall wee bee good servant of god and haue the same commendation with these few for true religion stands not in knowledge but in obedience and this is true obedience to make conscience of euerie sinne in our owne persons to take heed of the infection of sinne in others and to abstayne from the appearance of euill a happie church should we haue if these thinges were practised but this is the shame and reproach of our profession that wee haue no care of true obedience in our selues and others whereby we should glorifie god and grace our holy religion the church of rome hence gather that a man after baptisme may liue without mortall sinne for these few persons in this church in their baptisme put on christ and after kept themselues from all occasions of sinnes so as they had not committed any mortall sinne but their collection is vnsound for first though they had to this time abstained from all mortall sinne yet how can they prooue that they sinned not afterward secondly they are sayd not to haue defiled their garments not for that they had not committed any sinne but because they endeauoured to keepe themselues from the appearance of all sinne and so must the obedience which is ascribed to god children in scripture be vnderstood namely of their sincere purpose and endeauor to obey amp so among vs those that haue a setled purpose amp resolution to make conscience of euerie sin and in all things to doe the will of god they are reputed for keepers of the law for god in his children accepts the will for the deed and they shall walke with mee in white after the commendation of these fewe christ addeth a promise of liuing with him in glorie for so white garments haue alwayes beene vsed to signifie ioy happinesse life and glorie ecclesiast at all times let thy garments bee white that is take the delight and pleasure in vsing the creatures of god so that heere these fewe haue a promise to bee freed from all want and to liue with christ in all glorie ioy and pleasure this benefite hath beene in effect further vrged in the former chapter heere onely i will note one doctrine namely that they which liue in the world amonge the wicked and doe not communicate with their sinnes shall not partake with them in their punishments for the bodie of this church must haue christ to come amongest them as a theefe but the godly must walke with christ in white in glorie gen lot was freed from the destruction of the sodomites because hee partaked not with them in their sinnes and amonge the israelites ezek those that mourned for the sinnes of the people are marked in the fore head that when iudgements came vppon the wicked they might bee spared this point must bee remembred for by reason of longe peace and prosperitie among vs many sinnes abound as ignorance atheisme contempt of religion and prophaning of the lordes sabbath with innumerable sinnes of the second table all which call for iudgements from heauen and no doubt they will bee punished partly in this life and partly in the life to come vnlesse our people doe repent those therefore that would not partake of the common iudgements that are to come must nowe beware that they communicate not with the common sinnes that d e abounde and see that they keepe faith and good conscience hauing their righteous and zealous hearts grieued for the abhominations among which they liue after the promise is adioyned the reason thereof for they are worthy hence the church of roome doth conclude that a man by his workes may merite heauen because they bee worthie of reward a most blasphemous conclusion and a manifest abuse of the word of god god children indeede are worthie life euerlasting but not by the merite of their works for then they should bee done according to the rigour of the lawe but for the worthynesse of their person when as they stand righteous before god in christ for when god will saue any man he giues christ vnto that man truely and really so as hee may saye christ is mine and with christ god giues his spirite which worketh in his heart true sauing fayth whereby hee doth receiue christ and so christ and his righteousnesse belonges vnto that man reallye and by vertue thereof hee is worthie life euerlasting and this is the worthynesse which christ meaneth in this place and not any worthynesse of their workes so that this doth helpe them nothing at all and yet it is the most probable place of scripture to prooue and iustifie the doctrine of mans merits verse hee that ouercommeth shall be cloathed in white array and i will not put out his name out of the booke of life but i will confesse his name before my father and before his angels verse let him that hath an eare heare what the spirite sayth vnto the churches heere is the conclusion of this epistle and it containeth two partes a promise and a commaundement the promise in the fift verse and the commaundement in the sixt in the promise note two thinges first the parties to whome it is made to him that ouercommeth whereof we haue spoken chap before secondly the things promised to wit glorie and eternall happinesse which is expressed three wayes first thus hee shall bee cloathed in white array that is hee shall haue euerlasting life and happinesse so much is signified by white ayment as wee haue alreadie shewed hence the church of rome conclude that a man may doe good workes respecting a reward answere in some sort it is true for so it is recorded of moses hebr hee had respect to the recompence of reward but yet the recompence of reward must not bee the principall end of our good works for cheefely wee must thereby intend to testifie our faith and our obedience vnto god and with that wee may haue respect to euerlasting life the second thing promised and i will not put out his name out of the booke of life for the vnderstanding of this two questions must bee scanned first what this booke of life is secondly whether a man may bee blotted out of this booke for the first this booke of life is nothing else but god predestination or eternall decree of election whereby he hath chosen some man vnto saluation vpon his good pleasure and this is called a booke because it is like vnto a booke for as the generall in a campe hath the names of all his souldiours that fight vnder him in a booke and as the magistrate of a towne hath the name of euerie free man and denison in owled so god in the booke of his election hath the names of all that shalbe saued for the second question a man may bee written in the booke of life two wayes either truely before god or in the iudgement of man onely those whose names are truely before god written in this booke cannot be blotted out for god counsell touching the eternall state of euerie man is vnchangable this the goulden chayne of god decree doth plainely shew for whome hee hath predestinate rom them he hath called and whome hee called them also hee iustified and whome hee iustified them hee also glorified others there be that haue their names written in this booke only in the iudgement of man and thus are all man written in the booke of life that professe the gospell of christ in his church for so charitie bindes vs to iudge of them and these may haue their names blotted out in this sence doth the scripture often speake as when the prophet wisheth psalm that god would blot his enemy out of the booke of life meaning iudas principally his meaning is that it might bee made manifest his name was neuer written therein this then is the meaning of this promise that they who doe auoid the occasions of sin and haue care to keepe faith and good conscience vnto the end haue their names written in the booke of life and they shall neuer bee blotted out hence i gather two things first that the number of the elect in respect of god is certaine for the names of those which are to bee saued bee as it were written in a booke and being once written in they remayne there for euer some doe teach that all may bee saued if they will but this is a meere fancie of man for what should th e need any booke of life if that were so secondly hence i gather that this number can neither increase nor be diminished let man doe wha they can if they had been of vs they would haue continued with vs ioh all that thou hast giuen me haue i kept and none of them is lost ioh whereas a man may bee written in the booke of life to wit in the iudgement of man and yet bee blotted out hereby wee are to bee admonished to looke vnto our selues and to make conscience of euerie sinne and to avoide and shunne the verie occasions thereof for so long as wee professe the gospell and obey the same our names bee in the booke of life but when wee commit any sinne we doe as much as in vs lyeth make a penne and reach it vp to heauen to blot our names out of that booke and they that keepe a course in sinning doe plainely shewe that they were neuer truely written therein secondly considering that the number of the elect is certaine it must bee a motiue to cause vs to labour for some a rance of election that wee maye truely say wee haue our names written in god booke but here some bad person will saye seeing the number of the elect is vnchangeable i will liue as i list for if my name bee in the booke of god it shall neuer bee blotted out and if it bee not in it can neuer be added ans these man deceiue their owne soules for they that haue their names written in the booke of life shall liue as these few did in this church of sardis in true faith and holy obedience for he that is ordained to glorification is ordained to iustification and sanctification and it is impossible for him that shall be saued to liue alway in sin and therefore these man must rather labour to repent and beleeue and to get some signes of their election that they may know that their names are written in the booke of life the third benefite is this i will confesse his name before my father and before his angels that is in the day of iudgement i will acknowledge and professe him to be mine one of mine elect that keepeth faith and good conscience vnto the end i will take him from the company of the wicked world and set him on my right hand and aduance him to glory pronouncing vpon him the blessed voyce of absolution come thou blessed of my father mat the end why this benefit is thus propounded is to draw this church to professe the name of christ in this world for if they would professe christ before man hee will acknowledge them for his owne at the last day this same reason here propounded must induce vs to make a true confession of christ against the world amp all christs enemy which to doe is a very hard matter and man of himself cannot stand out but yet the consideration of this that christ will confesse him at the last day will be a notable motiue and means to inable him thereto if an earthly prince should come to a man among a great company and call him by his name speaking kindly vnto him hee would esteeme it a great honour vnto him and for that he would not sticke to die in the princes cause oh then what honour is this that christ iesus will in the last day vouchsafe to all those that in this life doe sincerely confesse him and ouercome he will confesse them to bee his and receiue them to his owne glorie but on the contrary those that will not confesse him heere but disgrace him either by false doctrine or profanesse of life will christ at the day of iudgement vtterly disgrace by denying them to be his and there pronounce vpon them the fearefull sentence of condemnation goe ye cursed ampc which if we would then escape and also procure vnto vs the ioyfull voyce of absolution we must here labour to hold the truth of christs doctrine amp also keep a good conscience vnto the end but if we only professe him in iudgement and not in the practise of a holy life surely christ will professe that he knows vs not and then giue vs our portion with the diuell and his angels the commandement followeth verse let him ampc of which wee haue spoken here beginneth the sixt particular epistle of our sauiour christ from this verse to the and before it as to the rest is prefixed a speciall commandement vnto john whereby he is enioyned to write this epistle vnto the church of philadelphia the end of which commandement is to warrant the calling of john to write this epistle but of this we haue spoken before the epistle it selfe containeth three parts a preface the matter of the epistle and the conclusion the preface in this verse these things saith hee ampc wherein is set downe in whose name this epistle is sent namely in christs where as in the former epistles he is excellently described for the winning of more credite vnto this epistle and that first by his properties holynesse and truth secondly by his kingly office in the words following for his properties first christ is sayd to be holy quest how can christ be said to be holy as he is man considering hee descended from adam who c ueyed his sinne and the guilt thereof to all his posteritie the common answere is this that indeed christ descended from adam as hee is man but his substance was sanctified by the holy ghost in the wombe of the virgin and thereby hee was freed from adams sinne this answere is true but not sufficient for man besides the corruption originall take from adam the guiltinesse of that sinne which adam committed now sanctification taketh away the corruption of sin but not the guilt thereof therefore a more full answere is this that all which come of adam by naturall generation doe receiue by that order which god set in nature at the creation saying increase amp multiply both the nature of adam and the sin amp guilt thereof but god for the preuenting of this in the incarnation of christ ordained that christ should not come of adam by naturall generation but by a miraculous conception of the holy ghost whereby hee tooke the nature of man with the infirmities thereof without the sinne of mans nature or the the guiltinesse thereof and thus is christ free from sinne as he is man further christ is holy two wayes in himselfe and in regard of his church in himselfe hee is holy sundry wayes first in regard of his godhead for his diuine nature is holinesse it selfe secondly as hee is man for his man hood was not only freed from all manner of sinne by reason of his miraculous conception but it was also inriched and filled with holinesse and that in greater measure than all man and angels for he receiued the gifts of the holy ghost without measure and againe as he is man christ is holy in regard of his obedience and actions for liuing on earth he did actually as our suertie fulfill the law for vs secondly christ is holy in regard of his church first because hee is the authour of that holynesse which is in euery member of his church yes hee is holy in regard of man in a further respect namely as the roote of all mans holinesse as he is mediator for looke as from adam is actually conueyed originall sinne to euery one of his posteritie that commeth by naturall generation so from christ is righteousnesse and holinesse conueyed to all that beleeue in him and for this cause hee is called co our righteousnesse and sanctification and in this sence especially is christ said to be holy in this place whereas christ is said to bee holy not only in himselfe but for vs here we must marke what is the principall thing in christian religion namely to haue care to bee ingraffed into christ that from him wee may receiue grace to become new creatures and feele in vs his power to kill our corruptions and dayly to renew his owne image in vs in righteousnesse and true holinesse and that as truely as wee feele in vs adams corruption it is not sufficient for vs to plead that christ will bee our sauiour and will free vs from all sinnes but wee must labour to haue christ conuay holinesse into vs and that as sensibly as wee see the roote conuay sappe into the branches and this holinesse wee must make to appeare in our liues as the branches by their fruit and leaues doe shew they receiue sappe from the roote secondly here note christ propounds himselfe vnto vs and to all churches as a notable patterne to be followed giuing vs to vnderstand that all that beleeue in him and looke to be saued by him must bee holy as hee is holy making conscience of euery euill way for christ is holy to make vs holy let vs therefore behold christ and see wherein hee expresseth himselfe to be holy and therein let vs follow him so john saith hee that hath this hope purifyeth himselfe as hee is holy that is vseth all good meanes to conforme himselfe to christs holinesse thirdly hereby wee learne that the common title giuen to the pope whereby hee is called holinesse is a blasphemous title for to be holy is here made a propertie of christ and yet more is giuen to the pope than to christ in this place for he is called holinesse which is a title of god alone the second propertie whereby christ is described is truth christ is sayd to bee true in three regards first because hee is without all error or ignorance knowing euery thing as it is truth is in christ properly and in the creatures onely by meanes of him secondly because whatsoeuer hee willeth and decreeth he doth it seriously without fraude deceit change or contradiction as the whole tenure of scriptures doe shewe wherein euery part is sutable and agreeable to another because hee maketh good euery promise made in his word for in him all the promises of god are yes and amen corinthian whereas christ is sayd to bee true yes truth it selfe first wee learne a full difference betweene him and all false wicked spirites for they are spirites of error and falshood for the diuell is the father of lyes and the author thereof againe whereas christ is true in all his wayes we ought without all doubting to beleeue his word and all the promises made therein that concerne our saluation if christ could erre or lye and man bee deceiued by him then they might iustly doubt of the truth of his word but seeing hee is true in all his promises wee must beleeue in him and in all our distresses either of bodie or mind depend vpon him for he hath made a promise to helpe and he will neuer faile them that rest on him thirdly in this propertie hee propounds himselfe an example to be followed of his church and of vs that as christ is serious in his decrees and constant in his promises so must wee purpose euery good thing seriously and also make good whatsoeuer good thing wee promise for lyers must bee destroyed psalm verse they that loue or make lyes must neuer come into heauen but e shut out thence and cast into the burning lake of fire and brimstone revelation but it is a note of a man that is a good member of god church in this world and that shall bee inheritour of christs kingdome in heauen to speake the trueth from his heart psalm verse and lying is a note of the childe of the diuell ioh secondly christ is described by his kingly office which hath the key of dauid which openeth and no man shutteth and shutteth and no man openeth vvhere first let vs see the meaning of the words for which purpose wee must haue recourse to esay verse whence these wordes are borrowed being there sayd of eliachim the circumstances of that text will easily shew the meaning of the wordes in this place shebna who had been an ancient steward to many of the kings of israel was treasurer also vnto king hezekias and because hee was an hinderer of reformation intended by hezekias the lord threatned to cast him out of his office and further the lord signifieth that eliachim shall come in his roome and haue the same office now to expresse this thing the lord sayth the key of the house of dauid shall bee layd vpon his shoulders that is eliachim shall bee made a steward of the house of dauid euen of the kingdome of dauid whereof hezekias was gouernour for so the house of iuda and the house of israel are often put for the whole kingdome of iuda and israel and the giuing of a key was an ancient token of placing and inuesting man in chiefe rule and authoritie so that the meaning of this place is this that god hath giuen vnto christ soueraigne power and authoritie of gouerning his church quest but why is christ sayd to haue the key of dauid for dauids kingdom was a temporall kingdome but christs kingdome is not of this world john and yet it is said the lord god shall giue vnto him the throne of his father dauid and hee shall raigne ouer the house of iacob luke answer christ may bee sayd to haue the keyes of dauid two wayes first properly for when hee was borne of the blessed virgin marie he was borne king of the iewes by right descent from his father dauid as his genealogie plainely sheweth luke and also the question of the wise man at ierusalem saying where is the king of the iewes that is borne mat and therefore when the publicans asked tribute of him he pleaded the priuiledge of a kings son albeit to auoyd offence he was content to yeeld of his right amp to pay tribute thereby sh wing that he had right to the kingdome of israel though he would not take it vpon him amp therfore came in such a time when the kingdome was taken of the romane emperour secondly he may bee sayd to haue the key of dauids kingdome tipically for dauids kingdome was a figure of christs kingdome and dauid himselfe a type of christ as it is most excellently dysciphered in the prophets ier amp hosea where christ is plainly called dauid by the name of him that was his type signe amp figure quest why were not as well the kingdomes of nebuchadnezzar and pharaoh types of christs kingdome as dauids answer because dauids kingdome was a kingdom of light and pietie but theirs were kingdomes of sinne and iniquitie and he is said to haue the key of dauids kingdom because his kingdome and the righteousnesse thereof was figured by the pietie in dauids kingdome and this kinde of speaking is iustifiable by god word so mat christ is called a nazarite which place hath relation to that which is said properly of sapson iudg who was a most excellent figure of christ and did most notably represent him in his death wherein hee killed more than in his life now christ is called an nazarite not because he obserued their rites and orders for that he did not he dranke wine so did not the nazarites but because he was the truth and substance of that order for in him was fully accomplished that holinesse which was figured by that order for he was perfectly seuered from all sinne and pollution and so here he is said to haue the key of dauid because hee had the soueraigntie which was figured by dauids kingdome which shutteth and no man openeth and openeth and no man shutteth here christs kingdome is compared to a house which can bee opened and shut by none but christ whereby is signified that none hath power aboue christ in his kingdome and that his power therein is soueraigne and absolute so that hereby is meant that christ iesus sitting in heauen hath soueraigne power and authoritie ouer the whole church of god to gouerne the same that we may the better vnderstand this soueraigne power of christ we must know it hath three parts i to prescribe ii to iudge iii to saue or destroy in prescribing christ hath absolute power and that in sundry things as first in prescribing doctrines of faith and religion vnto his church to bee beleeued and obeyed and that on paine of damnation this power he puts in execution when in the bookes of the old and new testament hee prescribeth the doctrine of the law amp the gospel to be obeyed and beleeued and none but he can make an article of faith or a law to binde the conscience and therefore paul saith whosoeuer shal teach any other doctrine then that which ye haue receiued of vs let him be accursed gal secondly for regiment he hath absolute power to prescribe how he will haue his church gouerned and by whom and therefore moses when he was to make the tabernacle exod heb did all things according to the patterne that the lord gaue vnto him so dauid gaue to salomon patternes of all things that were in him by the spirit touching the building of the house of god chronicle thirdly hee hath absolute power to appoint the time of keeping his sabbath for as the ordaining of a sabbath belongs to christ so doeth the changing thereof hee that prescribeth worship must prescribe the ordinary set time thereunto which is to continue to the end and therfore it is but an opinion of man to hold that the church may make two or moe sabbath dayes in a week if they wil fourthly in prescribing the sacramets and therefore corinthian paul saith what i haue receiued of the lord that deliuer i vnto you speaking of the lord supper for hee that giues grace must also appoint the signes and seales of grace the second part of christs soueraigne power is power of iudgement which is a soueraigne power to determine on his owne wil without the consent of others or submission to man or angels and in determining christ hath two priuiledges first to expound scripture the absolute power of expounding the law belongeth to the law giuer and his exposition is authenticall secondly to determine of all questions and controuersies in scripture and therefore it is a wicked opinion of the church of rome which hold that the principall iudge of interpreting scripture and decyding controuersies is the church the third part of christs soueraigne power is to saue and destroy this is expressed in these words hee openeth and no man shutteth and shutteth and no man openeth and for this cause he is sayd revelation to haue the keyes of hell and of death whereby is signified first that hee hath power to forgiue sins for that hee procureth at his fathers hands secondly that hee hath power to condemne for when man beleeue not his word hee hath power to hold them in their sins for which he can cast them into hell the ground of this three fold power of christ i this because hee is soueraigne lorde ouer his church and the members thereof the church of rome saith that this key of dauid hath more in it then soueraigntie ouer his church to wit a power to make and depose kings that bee in his church this they teach that they might proue the pope to haue title in ordayning and deposing of kings by vertue of the keyes but they erre grosly for though christ as he is mediatour bee aboue all kings yet in that regard hee neither maketh nor deposeth any kings and therefore he saith plainly ioh my kingdo is not of this world this caused him to refuse to take vpon him the office of an earthly iudge or prince to luke deuide an inheritance betweene two brother hence it was that he ioh refused to giue sentence of the adulterous woman and yet as christ is god hee maketh or deposeth earthly kings so the wise mail speaketh of him in the person of wisdo pro by me kings raign for the further cleering of this we must handle another point which is deriued hence concerning the power of the keyes which is a power whereby the power of the keyes of dauid is put in execution this power of the keyes is mentioned mat when christ saith vnto peter i will giue vnto thee the keyes of the kingdome of heauen and whatsoeuer thou shalt bind vpon earth shall be bound in heauen and whatsoeuer thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heauen this power of the keyes is a ministery granted to god church to open and shut the kingdome of heauen first i call it a ministerie that is a seruice because whatsoeuer the church doth in christs name is nothing but the duetie of seruantes vnto their lord from whence it is that the most worthy members and officers that euer were in the church as the prophets and apostles were but the ministers of christ that this is a seruice i shew more plainely thus when adam fell in his sinne all mankinde fell with him and thereby were all barred from the kingdome of heauen now since that fall christ became man and in his manhood satisfied the iustice of god for mans sinnes and this satisfaction of christ is properly that key whereby heauen is opened beeing opposite to mans sinne whereby it was shut and god church and ministers cannot properly open heauen by any power they haue but onely reueale vnto man what christ hath done for them and withall apply vnto them the doctrine of christs satisfaction which is reuealed and in this regard they are said to open and shut the kingdom of heauen not as lord but as ministers amp servant next i adde that this power is giuen to the church that is to the company of of true beleeuers called to saluation by christ and to none other and therefore it is sayd of them mat whatsoeuer you bind on earth shall be bound in heauen ampc thirdly i adde the end of this power of the keyes to open and to shut heauen how the church doth this christ that gaue this power knoweth best and hee hath set it downe john whosoeuers sinnes ye remit they are remitted and whosoeuers sinnes ye retayne they are retayned the church therefore opens heauen when it pardons mens sinnes and it shuts the same when it lawfully retaines their sinnes and holdeth them vnpardoned besides this there is no opening and shutting of heauen committed to the church quest can the church pardon sinne or retaine the same answer yes for these are the wordes of christ but let vs see how it is one thing to giue sentence of the pardon of sinne and another to pronounce the same sentence giuen to giue the sentence of the pardon of sinne is onely proper to christ the head of the church no saint nor angell hath that priuiledge but yet the church pronounceth the sentence of pardon giuen by christ if wee should say the the church should pardon sin we should rob christ of his honour for that is a priuiledge of his godhead thus wee se what the power of the keyes is the right vse of this power is when the church doth vse the same for the opening and shutting of heauen first in the name of christ alone as a servant secondly according to the rule of god word not after mens affections or inuentions thirdly for this end to bring sinners to repentance amp to continue them therin that they may be saued and to the church thus vsing this power christ hath promised that whatsoeuer they binde in earth shall be bound in heauen and whatsoeuer they loose in earth shall bee loosed in heauen mat further this power of the keyes hath two parts the ministerie of the word and spirituall iurisdiction the key of the ministerie of the word is set downe amp established by christ mat i will giue vnto thee the keyes of the kingdome of heauen ampc this ministery of the word is a key because it opens amp shuts heauen this it doth two wayes first by teaching and explayning the substance of religion the doctrine of saluation whereby man must come to heauen amp in that regard is called the key of knowledge lu secondly by applying the promises of the gospel and the threatning of the lawe for when in the ministerie of the word the promises of remission of sins amp life euerlasting are applyed to beleeuers that repent then the kingdom of heauen is opened amp when as in the same ministerie of the word the curses of the law are denouced against impenitent sinners then is the kingdom of heaue shut yet touching the ministerie of the word this distinction must be remembred that otherwhiles the church is certen of the faith amp repentance of some man or some congregation and then they may pronounce remission of sins absolutely but otherwhiles they are vncerten of their faith and repentance or of their impenitencie amp then they must accordingly remit or retaine mens sins that is conditionally pronouncing the remission of sins to all that repent amp denouncing damnation to all that repent not and thus is the word to be publikely handled in god church at this day because our congregations are mixt company consisting of some that repent amp beleeue and of others that doe not truely repent nor beleeue the second part of this power of the keyes is spiritual iurisdiction i call it spirituall to distinguish it from that outward iurisdiction whereby the commonwealth is gouerned that this spiritual iurisdiction is a key may appeare mat if thy brother offend thee saith christ admonish him priuately if hee heare thee not yet take with thee two or three if he heare not them tell it to the church amp if he refuse to heare the church let him bee vnto thee as an heathen man and as a publican then followeth the promise verely i say vnto you whatsoeuer ye bind on earth shalbe bound in heauen and what soeuer ye loose shal be loosed in haauen this spirituall iurisdiction is a power whereby the church pronounceth sentence vpon obstinate offenders in the church and puts the same in execution and it hath two parts excommunication and absolution excommunication is an action of the church in christs name excluding an obstinate offender that is a professor of the gospel from all the priuildedges of the church and from the kingdom of heauen so paul corinthian commandeth the incestious man to be committed to sathan that is not onely put out of the kingdome of christ but also after a sort made subiect vnto sathan to bee outwardly afflicted by him and therefore christ saith if mat he heare not the church let him be vnto thee as an heathen man that is as one that hath no title to the kingdome of heauen heere may some say can the church thrust any man out of the kingdome of heauen answer it is christ only that receiueth man in thither and it is he alone that must thrust them out the church doth not properly either receiue man in or put them out but onely pronounce and declare what christ doth in this behalfe as if a man that liues in the church bee a common drunk rd the church finding in god word that co no drunkard can inherite the kingdome of heauen which is the sentence of christ may pronounce the same against him and so exclude him from the kingdome of heauen obiect the true child of god may be excomunicated but he can neuer be excluded from the kingdome of heauen ans the true childe of god may for a time and in part be excluded the kingdome of heauen in part as a man that hath freedome in an incorporation may lie in prison for some trespasses and so want the vse of his freedome though he be a freeman so the child of god for committing sinne may want the vse of his libertie and freedome which he hath in god kingdome and for a time while hee liueth in sinne without repentance yet wholly and for euer hee cannot but so soone as hee repents hee shall bee receiued certainely againe for no man is to bee barred either from heauen or the church any longer then hee remaineth impenitent whereas this censure is such as doth exclude a man both from the kingdom of heauen and the liberties of the church till he repent we may here see that this censure ought to bee vsed with great reuerence feare and consideration euen such or greater as wee would vse in the cutting of a member from the bodie the abusing therfore of this sentence in small matters cannot but be a grieuous sin and a breach of the third commandement wherein one of god most weightie ordinances is taken in vaine further one speciall degree of excommunication is anathema which is when one is pronounced to bee condemned whereof paul speaketh corinthian but this is not pronounced vpon any but on those that sin against the holy ghost and therfore it is seldom vsed because that sin is hardly discerned cosisting not so much in the speech as in the malice of the heart against christ the second part of this spirituall iurisdiction is absolution which is when a malefactor vpon his sufficiet repentance is approued to be a meber of the church and is admitted to the kingdome of heauen and yet here the church receiues him not into the kingdome of christ but only declareth vpon his repentance what christ doth and thus we see wherin ecclesiasticall iurisdictio consisteth amp what be the parts of the power of the keyes for the better discerning of this power of the keyes wee must remember foure special abuses hereof that haue take place in god church for many hundred years the first is this that in former ages the church hath giuen this power of the keies to peter alone debarring the same from all other euen from the rest of the apostles as though they had only the vse not the right of this power but the ease is plaine this power belongs to euery true minister of the gospel though they be not apostles as well as it did to peter for in the promulgation of this power mat thogh christ direct his speech to peter yet he speaketh vnto all as the circumstances of the place doe plainly shew for christs question whom say ye that i am was made to all nowe because it would haue beene great disorder in that holy company for all of them to haue spoken therefore peter being both ancient and bould of speech speaketh for all and the rest answered in his person and so accordingly christ speaking to peter doth make a grant of this power vnto all his disciples in his person and therefore ioh he giues this power to all saying plainly whosoeuers sins ye retaine they are retained ampc so that the word of god is plaine in this point to satisfie the conscience of any that is not wilfully addicted to the popish religion quest whence haue the ministers of the gospell this power answer by succession from the apostles for christ saith mat goe and preach i will be with you to the end of the world where he cannot meane the apostles only but with the all ministers that did preach and baptise after them making this promise to the apostles not as they were apostles but as they were ministers and preachers of his gospel the second abuse is that the church of rome hath turned the power of the keies into a supremacie ouer the church making it to bee a soueraigne authoritie whereby peter and his successors the popes haue libertie to make lawes canos amp constitutions which bind the conscience as also to make kings and to depose the same a most notorious abuse of this power which is no superioritie but a ministerie the chiefe power whereof consisteth in the dispensation of the word amp wil of christ for christ said not to peter i will giue thee the keyes of the kingdoms of me but of the kingdom of heauen the third abuse hereof is that the church of rome hath thereby for a yeeres almost barred kings queenes and emperors from being gouernors ouer the churches of god an error flat against scripture for when as good king iosias intended the reformation of religion and the abandoning of idolatry he made a couenant with the lord for the accomplishment of the same amp is said chro to haue caused all that were found in ierusalem and beniamin to stand to the couenant which he made now shall we say iosias did euill in causing the so to doe god forbid it is recorded of him by the holy ghost for his comendation obiect but god pastors amp teachers haue the power of the keyes and princes haue not ans true but yet they haue a ciuil power wherby they rule ouer god church for there is a ciuil power amp a spirituall power princes rule not by any spirituall power but ciuilly amp therby they haue power to compell all their subiects to the outward means of god worship amp to forsake idolatry and may also punish those that obey them not obiect by this power of the keyes kings and queenes are brought vnder pastors answer in pastors and ministers we must consider their persons and goods amp their office and word which they bring princes are ouer their persons and goods and yet may be vnder their word amp ministerie because therein they stand in christs stead yet al this sheweth nothing why princes in god church should be so robbed of their right as the church of rome doth the fourth abuse is that the church of rome for some yeeres hath turned the power of the keyes vnto the priest in their sacrament of penance for wheras by god word the ministers power is onely to pronounce the absolution of christ with them euery priest sits as a iudge and all the people come vnto him as to a iudge making knowen vnto him all their thoughts words and deeds as neere as they can wherein they haue broken any commandement which done the priest enioynes him to bewaile his sinnes and after contrition doth properly giue sentence of pardon euen as christ himselfe doth and then after appoints him workes of satisfaction to be done for the temporall punishment of his sinnes which done his sins are pardoned in heauen where behold a most deuillish practise as may appeare by the manifold errors contained therein as first the confession of all a mans sinnes which hath no warrant in god word secondly that the priest should giue sentence of pardon is a most notorious practise whereby christ is robbed of his honour for the pharises could say none can forgiue sins but god that is properly mark which christ approueth and it is must true for he that can forgiue sins properly must make satisfaction for sins thirdly they absolue from the fault but they will not forgiue the punnishment and thereby they robbe others to inrich themselues fourthly they enioyne satisfaction to god by man for their sinnes whereby they doe nothing els but ouerturn the al sufficient satisfactio of christ and enioine that to man which is impossible al these are most horrible abuses of this power which ought to bee knowen and considered being a sufficient warrant vnto vs that the church of rome is no true church of god for though the pope cary in his armes the keys yet they are not the keyes of heauen but of hell for he hath made moe places of rest and woe than euer god did as limbus p t u and purgatorie amp therefore must needs make moe doores thither and so moe locks amp keies by this doctrine touching the keyes of dauid giuen to christ and the power of the keyes in the church deriued thence we may learne sundry things first that christ who hath the keyes of dauid to open and shut doth not open to all but to some onely the reason hereof is this adam beeing created in integritie was in the fauour of god but by his sinne he lost the fauour of god amp so barred himselfe both out of the earthly and heauenly paradise and all his posteritie by the same sin and by their owne actuall sins are likewise debarred for isa sinne is a partition wall betweene vs and god and a lam cloud between our praiers and god himselfe as ieremie speaketh so that sinne is the cause of this exclusion and so many sins as a man committeth so many bolts and barres hee maketh to exclude himselfe from the kingdome of heauen the consideration whereof should moue euery one to take a narrow view of his miserable state in himself through ada for by originall sin wherin we were born and by our actual transgressions wherin we liue we barre our selfe from the kingdome of heauen it is lamentable to see how the whole world lyeth in sinne and how the deuill bewitcheth man to conceale or diminish their sins making great sins small and little sinnes none at all when as the least sinne which they commit without repentance is sufficient to barre them for euer out of the kingdome of heauen againe seeing euery sinne doth barre vs out of heauen this must be a motiue to induce euery one of vs to repent of all our sinnes to bewayle the same amp to pray earnestly for the pardon of them in the death of christ and continually to labor to turne vnto god from all sinne because if wee liue but in one sinne it will bee a mightie bar e sufficient to exclude vs the kingdome of heauen eternally thirdly seeing christ keep the keyes of heauen heereby wee are taught to come vnto christ amp to seek by him to enter into the kingdom of heaue for christ by his death hath opened heauen as hee sayd vnto nathaniell and philip ioh verily verily i say vnto you hereafter shall yee see heauen open meaning by the ministrie of the gospell and seeing it is open we must striue to enter into it as the man in john baptists time did mat this we do by endeuoring to become good members of god church on earth for that is the dore and suburbs of the kingdome of heauen which euerie one must enter into that would come to heauen it selfe euen as a man that would goe into a house must needs come to the dore now in the church there is the true dore which is christ himselfe and the key thereof which is his word and the ministerie of the word which doth locke and vnlocke the same quest what shall we doe to become true members of the church ans we must doe two things first humble our selues for all our sinnes praying vnto god for the pardon of them and beleeuing the same through christ secondly endeauor and purpose by god grace euerie day to leaue the same sinnes this doing wee are at the dore of heauen and if wee would haue our soules enter into heauen when wee die this wee must doe while we liue but if we enter not into the dore of grace by the key of knowledge in the ministerie of the word while we liue wee shall neuer come to the gate of glorie after death in this verse and so forward to the twelft is contayned the matter of this epistle which may bee reduced to three eads a praise a promise and a commaundement the praise in this eight verse the promise in the and the commaundement in the for the first the praise of this church is first summarily propounded i know thy works which hath beene expounded and the end thereof with the vses in the former epistles then hee addeth the reason of his comendation wherin are two things to bee obserued i the signe of christs approbation in these words i haue set before thee an open dore ii their conuersation or the workes which christ approoued in the words following thou hast a litle stregth and hast kept my word amp hast not denied my name both these may be vndetstood either of the angell and minister of this church or of the whole church also i take it to bee meant of both being spoken of the minister of this church the words beare this sence behold i haue set before thee an open dore ampc that is behold and consider i haue vouchsafed vnto thee oportunitie and libertie to preach the gospell and thereby to conuert man vnto me so much s paul meaneth by the dore of vtterance corinthian for thou hast a little strength and hast kept my word and hast not denyed my name that is though thou be indued but with a small measure of gifts pertaining to thy calling yet thou hast maintayned my gospell and hast not denyed my name these words being thus expounded doe affoord vs these instructions first from the signe of his approbation wee learne that it is a great priuiledge for any minister to haue libertie to preach the gospell and thereby to conuert man vnto christ so much the word of attention behold importeth which may also further appeare by this that the most famous and worthy prophets of god were not alwayes vouchsafed this fauour as isay and ezekiell who were sent sometime to harden isay thy people and christ himselfe complaineth of the want of this priuiledg saying isay i haue spent my stregth in vaine and in regard of this priuiledge the ministers of the gospell are called obad tim sauiors and by reason of this libertie they haue title to the promise of shining as starres in glorie daniel this therefore is an vnspeakable mercie and so ought to bee esteemed and all ministers that haue the same vouchsafed vnto them ought highly to magnifie the name of god for it and to value it more worth than all earthly blessings whatsoeuer secondly from the workes which christ approoued in the angell of this church we may obserue that ministers indued with small measure of gifts may bee able to doe great seruice vnto god in his church this thing is plaine in the minister of this church and might also bee shewed by manifold examples of such man in all ages but to come to our times in the dayes of queene marie when religion was in banishing this our famous schoole of the prophets had many learned man in it yet not one of them stood out for the defence of the gospell when as a poore secular priest not three miles off who was far behind them in gifts of learning and knowledg yet hauing the truth reuealed vnto him did stand out for the maintenance of the same euen to the sealing of it with his blood and at this day many man of smaller gifts in the ministrie doe more further the gospell by the encrease of the knowledge of christ crucified and true obedience than those that are inriched with far greater gifts of knowledge both in tongues and arts so as though they be many hundred degrees short in regard of schoole learning yet they go as farre before them in benefiting god church if this be so will some say then it is needlesse for man to bee brought vp so much in the schooles of learning ans not so for as much as may be god ministers ought to haue knowledge of schoole learning both in artes and tongues and yet for all this it oft commeth to passe by god prouidence that the greatest clerks for learning are lesse profitable to the church tha man of smaller gifts this god doth to humble the learned that they be not proud in themselues and to magnifie the worke of his spirite in the weaker instruments further these words must also be vnderstood of the whole church and then they beare this sence i haue set before thee an open dore that is i haue vouchsafed vnto thee a speciall priuiledge euen libertie to enter into the kingdome of heauen from whence we obserue that libertie to life euerlasting is a speciall priu ledge belonging not to all man but onely to the church of god and the true members of christ this point hath sundrie vses i to confute this erronious opinion that christ did effectually redeeme all and euerie man which is at against god word and this text for those that are effectually redeemed haue libertie to enter into the kingdome of heauen but all man haue not that libertie for then it were no priuiledge of god church alone to haue heauen opened vnto them ii seeing this is a priuiledge which god vouchsafeth vnto his church to haue heauen gate opened vnto them hereby we are taught to take the benefite of this libertie while the dore is open and in time to striue to enter therein for as christ telleth nathaniell the church of the new testament shall by faith see heauen open ioh we must not therefore neglect this oportunitie but it is our common shame that wee be slacke in seeking the kingdome of god and the righteousnes thereof suffering our selues so to bee clogged with heapes of sins and worldly lusts that we can neither walke in that straight way nor enter into that dore that leadeth vnto life for sinne is n heauie burden like a great packe that will not suffer a man to enter into so strait a dore we must therefore cast off all sinne that hee may so enter in and walke in the way of life and no man can shut it here is the continuance of the former benefite against all aduersarie power whatsoeuer and this againe confuteth another opinion of the same kinde with the former to wit that christ dyed for euerie man but yet some are not saued because they wil not they shut heauen dore against themselus but this opinion cannot stand for none can shut heauen dore against them to whome christ hath set it open effectually neither sinne satan nor the world no not man himselfe nor all their power together for herein is the will of man ruled by the will of god and looke whome god will haue to enter into heauen them doth hee encline to will their owne saluation and also make vnwilling euer to shut this dore against themselus for thou hast a little strength and hast kept my word ampc that is thou article indued with some measure of grace as of faith hope and righteousnesse and according to that measure thou hast maintained my word and not denyed my name hence we learn that a man indued with a small measure of god grace may doe workes pleasing vnto god amp by the same grace come to life uerlasting christ saith to his disciples mat if your faith were as much as a grain of mustard seed by it should you bee able to remooue mountaines now that which is here sayd of the faith of miracles may in like sort be said of all faith and so of iustifying faith if a man haue neuer so small a measure therof yet thereby hee shall doe workes acceptable to god for as paul teacheth god children receiue not the tenths but rom the first fruits of the spirit that is a small measure of grace in this life which is onely a pledge of that which they shall fully receiue in the world to come for this cause is rahab commended for her faith heb although it was but small and weake as wee shall see if wee read the whole historie iosh for god accepteth of man according to that hee hath receiued it is not so much the measure of grace that saueth a man as the truth of grace before god this serueth notably for the comfort of those that haue care to keepe faith and good conscience such are most dismaied by reason of their wants amp corruptions but they must know that god approoueth of their grace though it bee but small if so be they haue care to increase in grace and doe striue to please god in all things according to the measure of grace receiued ii hereby euerie one must be encoraged to embrace and obey true religion many bee dismayed herein by reason of the great measure of obedience which they thinke god requireth and therefore they leaue of all obedience but this ought not to bee so for god approoueth of a man in christ according to that grace which hee hath be it more or lesse and not according to that which by the law he ought to haue and yet none of all this must make vs slacke and negligent in vsing those means which god hath vouchsafed vnto vs for the increase of grace that so wee may also increase in true obedience and hast kept my word and hast not denyed my name here hee setteth downe two workes for the which he commendeth this church first their faithfull keeping of the word of christ secondly the profession of his name in the time of persecutio this behauior of this church must be a paterne and a looking glasse for vs to square our conuersation by for these works thou hast kept my word and hast not denyed my name though the words be few yet they continue much in them signifying that this church had speciall care of keeping god word in euerie commaundement both legall and euangelicall happie were our church if the same might truely be said of vs that we had care of obedience vnto god and of the true profession of his name but generally we faile in practise though in outward profession we make some shew thereof thus much of the praise of this church heere followes the second part of this epistle namely the promises of christ which are two first concerning the conuersion of certaine iewes verse secondly concerning the deliuerance of these philadelphians in the time of temptation verse for the first of these promises in all likelyhood there was in this citie of philadelphia a synagog of the iewes which bare an outward shewe that they were the true worshippers of god albeit they denyed the name of christ and persecuted his church yet christ here promiseth that he will conuert them and make them members of his church and cause them to worship him in the congregation before this church of philadelphia in this promise note three points touching the conuersion of these iewes the author thereof the parties conuerted and the fruit of their conuersion for the first i saith christ behold i will make them the wordes are verie significant being doubled and they make christ the whole and sole author of their conuersion hence we learne that in the conuersision of a sinner god hath the whole and sole worke true it is that a man willeth his conuersion in the act thereof but yet it is god that worketh that will in him it is not of himselfe this confuteth the erronious doctrine of free will in the church of rome whereby they teach that a man can dispose himselfe to worke out his saluation being onely helped by god grace like vnto a sicke man who though he bee weake yet being holden vp by another can goe of himselfe ans but saint paul teacheth vs that a man by nature is not sick or weak with sinne but starke ephesian dead in sinne and can no more mooue himselfe in the worke of his conuersion tha a dead man in the graue in the worke of his resurrection but they say by this wee make a man like vnto a blocke answer not so for though hee cannot turne himselfe vnto god yet hee hath his will and vnderstanding free to vse in ciuile and outward actions and besides the e is a possibilitie in his nature to bee conuerted by grace which is not in a blocke again wheras christ sayth i will make them come and they shall come heere is plainly confuted the doctrine and opinion of some which hold that a man being effectually called may come vnto christ or not come at his pleasure when god hath giuen grace man may receiue it or refuse it if hee will this is flat against this text for god will make them come and mans will must bee plyable to god will in this matter but they alleage mat oh ierusalem ierusalem how oft would i haue gathered thee as a hen ampc but thou woldest not answer christ there speaketh not of the wil of his good pleasure for that cannot be resisted but of his signified will in the ministerie of his prophets and by himselfe as hee was a prophet and the minister of circumcision vnto the iewes for so he might will their conuersion and yet they will it not obiect act ye stiffe necked iewes ye haue alwayes resisted the holy ghost answer that must be vnderstood of the ministerie of the prophets and apostles who spake by the spirit of god and not of the spirit himselfe ii point the parties conuerted namely them of the synagog of satan such as called themselues the onely true worshippers of god and yet indeed and in truth were no better than the slaues of satan this is to be obserued for hereby we may see that not onely sinners which commit small sinnes are conuerted vnto god but euen grieuous and ancient sinners such as haue long conc ued the slaues of satan christ died not for painted sinners but for grieuous sinners and therefore paul chargeth timothy and the ministers with him tim to waite for the conuersion and repentance of them that were taken in the snare of the diuell and that according to the diuels owne will rom paul speaketh of some gentils that were giuen vp to a reprobate sence which was a fearefull case and yet no doubt many of them were after turned to beleeue the gospell for such are they that are taken in the snare of the diuell and yet there is repentance to be wayted for of them this doctrine must not bee abused to libertie in sinning for that is the right way to cast our soules into the pit of destruction but yet seeing christ will bring home into his kingdome most greeuous sinners we must hereby take occasion not to be discouraged either by the greatnesse or multitude of our sins from comming vnto christ for marke christ only raysed three that were dead to life iayrus daughter that was newe dead the widowes son that lay on the herste and lazarus that lay stinking in the graue this is a notable figure of the conuersion of sinners hee will not onely call to repentance small and young sinners but euen great and old sinners that lye rotting and stinking in the graue of sinne as lazarus did in the graue of death hee came to call sinners to repentance and to saue the lost sheepe which are readie to bee deuoured by woolues and wilde beast wee must all blesse the name of christ for this his large mercie and in time lay hold vpon it and repent iii point the fruite of their conuersion in these wordes they shall come and worshippe before thy foote and shall knowe that i haue loued thee these wordes may bee fitly expounded by another place of scripture corinthian if all prophesie and there come in one that beleeueth not or one vnlearned he is rebuked of all man and iudged of all so as the secrets of his heart are disclosed and he will fall downe on his face and worship god and say plainly god is in you indeed so that the meaning of these words is this i will cause the to come to the cogregation of god people amp at their feet to fall downe and worship the true god heere are set downe twoo notable fruits of the conuersion of a sinner first concerning god the second concerning the church the fruit of conuersion that respecteth god is the true worship of god noted in these words i will make them come and worship that is in spirite and truth with bodie and soule to adore the true god this fruite no man can bring forth till hee bee conuerted for psalm the wicked and naturall man cals not vpon god true it is they will acknowledge there is a god and that the same god is to bee worshipped and therefore they will come outwardly and heare the word and receiue the elements of the sacraments but the true worship of god is in spirite and truth from the heart which a naturall man cannot perfourme vnto god this is the fruit of true couersion which when a man receiueth hee doth heare the word of god with reuerence tremble at god iudgements and mingle the doctrine of the gospell with faith in his heart and in calling vpon god hee feeles his sinnes and therefore by prayer doth earnestly desire the supply of grace and the remission of his sins hauing his hart also beleeuing that he shall receiue mercie and in thankesgiuing his heart is filled with ioy and the grace of thankefulnesse so as being conuerted all his worship vnto god is in spirit and truth in the worship of these iewes are noted three properties required in god seruice first it must bee willing and cherefull so did these iewes worshippe god for they are sayd not onely to worship god but to come and worship god and thus doe all god children worship him isay those whom god bringeth to his mountaine hee maketh ioyfull in his house of prayer psalm they shal come willingly in the day of assemblies by this propertie wee may see a great number at this daye euerie where come farre short in the true worship of god for most man neuer regard the preaching of the word but content themselues with morning and euening prayer which they frequent to auoide the penaltie of the lawes of the magistrate and the shame of the world but these are miserable worshippers of god his worship ought to bee free and willing the second propertie the worship of god must bee expressed with seemely meet and conuenient gesture the word translated worship signifieth doing of reuerence with bowing of the body and knee and therfore it is not an indifferent thing but necessarie to vse conuenient gesture in god worship that thereby the grace and humilitie of the heart may bee expressed the isay angels that stand before the throne of god haue two winges to couer their feete and two to couer their faces therby testifying their reuerence to god maiestie in this point also many come short for as the common complaint is the maner of many is to lie snorting and sleeping vnder mens elbows at sermons and in the time of prayer to sit vnreuerently with their heads couered these things ought not to be for god is lord of body and soule and ought to be worshipped with both the third propertie all that will truly worship god must first bee humbled for their sinnes and haue the pride of their hearts brought downe and bee stroken with a feare of god glorious maiestie so these iewes did prostrate their body at the feete of the congregation when they came to worship god the act iaylor that imprisoned paul and silas ouer night and put their feete in the stockes would then haue verie little regarded paules doctrine beeing so cruell and rigorous to their persons yet when he was about to haue killed himselfe with his sword supposing the prisoners had beene gone because hee sawe the dores open hee was glad and ioyfull to heare the voice of paul who called vnto him that hee should doe himselfe no harme for they were all there then being humbled by that strange and woonderfull worke of god he comes in vnto them humbles himselfe and fals downe before them crauing them to tell him what hee must doe to bee saued in like manner so long as man haue not their proud hearts beaten downe they will neuer worship god in spirit and truth would wee therefore know why the most part worshippe god formally surely it is because they haue not beene humbled with a feare of god maiestie and a terrour of hell neither can it bee hoped that we shall euer worship god sincerely till our hearts bee thus broken within vs and we touched with the feare of god iudgements the want hereof is the cause why man and woman content themselues with a bare mumbling ouer of the words of the lord prayer the creede and ten commaundements neuer seeking in the sinceritie of their heart cheerefully and willingly both with soule and bodie to doe worship vnto god the second fruite of true conuersion concerneth man and that is a reuerence of the true worshippers of god noted in these words before thy feete these iewes when they were conuerted did not think themselues worthy to bee members of this congregation but submitted themselues to be foot stooles vnto them this reuerence shewes it selfe in this one thing which is the ground thereof namely a base opinion which euery true conuerted person hath of himselfe by reason of his owne vnworthinesse this was in paul causing him to call himselfe the tim cheefe of all sinners and the same ought to be in euerie one of vs for this is true grace and a note of true repentance when a man or woman can truely abase themselues beneath all god people so as if the question were who is the vilest person in the church the conscience of euerie man should answere i my selfe the proude and pharesaicall heart is farre from true conuersion but the humble hart is pleasing to god and shall know that i haue loued thee these words contain a reason of the former submisse behauiour of these iewes for it might bee asked why shall these iewes come to ioyne themselues with god people and bee content to make themselues foote stooles vnto them the answere is because christ will make them know that hee hath loued his church here marke and see the ground of all true reuerence god loue and fauour sundrie pe son both in church and common wealth haue reuerence due vnto them as maisters from their servant parents from their children and all superiours from their inferiours now if these man would attaine to true reuerence indeede first they must seeke to be in the loue and fauour of god and of his children and so shall they procure vnto themselues true reuerence for when man set their hearts to feare god then will god turne the harts of man to reuerence them this ought to be thought vpon of those that be great in birth and wealth they must not stand on these things but look to the foundation of true reuerence namely the fauour of god which they must seek for and getting that god will get them reuerence euen of wicked man the cause why many in high place as magistrate maisters ampc want due reuerence is for that they care not for the fauour of god the ground thereof these words containe the second promise of christ vnto this church concerning their preseruation in time of most bloodie persecution for this epistle vnto this church as also this booke was written by john after the ascention of christ in the daies of domitian the emperour of rome after whome succeeded tra anus who when hee was seated in his empire raysed vp greeuous persecution against god church in all places of his dominion wherein he put to death innumerable thousandes of christians for the space of foureteene yeares of this persecution our sauiour christ fore tels this church calling it the houre of temptation and withall he promiseth to preserue this church in the time of this bloodie persecution adding a reason thereof because they had constantly and syncerely professed his gospell in this promise of preseruation note sundry points i the occasion thereof the keeping of the word of his patience ii the thing promised deliuerance vnder traianus iii a pr diction of this persecution that it shall come vpon the world for this end to trie them i point the word of christs patience some expound to be christs commandement of patience but that exposition is too strait here it signifieth the whole doctrine of saluation by christ which is called the word of patience first because it teacheth patience secondly because it is the instrument of patience for when a man knowes saluation by christ and also bel eues the same to belong to him that will make him patient in all the miseries of this life thirdly because it cannot bee professed and holden vnto death without patience but as it is sayd of the good ground it bringeth forth fruit with patience so must euerie one doe that professeth this gospell in this occasion of god promise obserue that god grace well vsed is rewarded with increase those which haue receiued but small measure of grace at the first by becomming faithfull therein haue receiued increase which serues to mooue vs to bee faithfull in the vse of those tallents which wee haue receiued for heereby wee shall receiue increase when as those which hauing receiued good gifts from god as knowledge and such like because they haue not beene faithfull in the vse thereof haue beene depriued of the same wherefore whosoeuer hath begun to know the will of god to beleeue and to repent let the same parties proceed to vse those giftes still to god glorie and the good of his church and people among whom they liue and they shall see the lord will double and treble and greatly increase the same vnto them againe note the doctrine of the gospell is a doctrine of patience this sheweth how good and meete it is for euerie one to learne the gospell in the dayes of peace for euerie one in times of tryall wold wish for strength and patience and wee know not how long these dayes of peace will last againe each man in his calling is subiect to many crosses and miseries for in the sweat of our face must wee eat our bread and who is free from paines and diseases yes who can scape death it selfe now in all these and in all other troubles wee haue neede of patience and therefore in the time of health and ease let vs hide in our hearts the seedes of this grace to wit the doctrine of the gospell and then in due time wee shall reape the fruit of patience which will make vs contented in all distresses both of life and death and if wee would know why most man are so impatient in afflictions it is because they haue so little knowledge and faith in the gospell of his grace secondly seeing the gospell is the word of patience heereby all persons that looke to bee saued by the gospell must learne to put on patience keeping a moderation in all their thoughts wils and affections for when wee be impatien any way wee are not sutable to the doctrine of our saluation thirdly this word of patience is called christs the word of my patience because christ is the author of it this is added to beat downe the pride of this church for when god doth praise them for their obedience their hearts might haue beene puff d vp with pride but to preuent this euill in this church whom he now praised hee calleth it his patience that they might not thinke this good thing was of themselues and the same consideration must checke the proude thoughts that rise in our hearts namely to remember that no good thing wee haue is our owne but christs what hast thou which thou hast not receiued why then shouldest thou boast corinthian ii point the thing promised is preseruation and deliuerance in the bloodie persecution vnder traianu in which for the space of fourteene yeares innumerable christians were put to death i will deliuer thee from the houre of temptation here first obserue that god hath appointed certaine set houres and times for the triall of his church as well for the gift of his grace as of their wickednesse and hypocrisie thus he led the israelites deut fortie yeares in the wildernesse to see whether they would obey him and hee sent deut false prophets amonge them to trie whether they would turne from the true god or no and as god thus dealeth with his church so hee bath appointed particular times and houres wherein hee will trie particular persons gen god bid abraham kill his son and that was his tryall and chro hezekias was left vnto himselfe that the lord might see all that was in his heart and so for euerie christian god hath a set time of triall wherin he will either make manifest his grace or disclose their hypocrisie this point ought to bee well weighed for herein the lord dealeth like the worthie founders of great schooles who haue appointed certaine set times of posing for the tryall of their schollers to see what euerie ones proceeding is that they may be accordingly rewarded and as it is a shame for one to haue been long in a good schoole and to haue made no proceedings in learning so it is for any one that hath liued long in the schoole of christ and hath not profited in grace this therefore must teach vs these duties first to try our selus and that staightly concerning our progresse in knowledge faith repentance and obedience for god himselfe will trie vs whose eyes wee can neuer blinde though wee may deceiue man he will lay open our hearts and make knowne what is in vs whether it bee true grace or false hypocrisie let vs not couer our selues with figge leaues for god will strip vs naked but rather let vs search our selus touching our sins and god graces and neuer rest contented till wee haue found in our soules the good gifts of grace which will abide his tryall secondly hereby we are admonished as neere as we can to conforme our harts and liues vnto the word and wil of god for he will trie vs woonderfull it is to see how common the reproch of presizenesse is and if it were not well knowne that the world is full of athiests that might discourage many a christian but the remembrance of this triall wherein hypocrisie will vanish as the stubble before the fire must mooue vs to labour for sinceritie when we haue done our best wee shall bee farre short of that wee ought to bee and therefore through the reproach of the world let vs hold on our good endeauour and labour to haue the maine graces of true faith and a good conscience with a resolute purpose not to sinne that so we may stand in the day of tryall but if wee want these and liue loosely wee shall be found like the foolish virgin that haue onely the blasing lampes of an outward profession and want the sauing oyle of grace which may make vs acceptable vnto god at his appearing wee haue beene trayned vp in the schoole of christ what a shame will it be if when christ comes to prooue vs we be then found barren and voide of sound grace dauid bethinking himself of this trial of the lord doth conforme himselfe vnto the will of god and therefore offereth himselfe vnto his tryall saying psalm lord prooue mee meaning in regard of the truth and synceritie of a good conscience not of the perfectnesse of his owne wayes and hereunto must wee endeauour not suffering any sinne to raigne in vs qu but how was this promise verified touching their deliuerance from persecution seeing no church was free from it for euen the churches of asia whereof this in philadelphia was a principall one were persecuted by traianus answer this and such like promises of deliuerance to god children from tryals and afflictions must bee vnderstood not simply but with condition to wit so farre foorth as they may bee hurtfull vnto them and in the least measure hinder their saluation and indeed they are promises of deliuerance from the euill of temptation and persecution not from persecution and temptation it selfe psalm the lord promiseth to him that trusteth in god the plague shall not come neere his dwelling and yet by experience wee know that god children in generall plagues are taken away as well as others and therefore that promise must bee vnderstood of deliuerance not from the plague it selfe but from the hurt therof so as it shall not hinder the good or saluation of any in the godly mans house we pray lead vs not into temptation which wee must not vnderstand of freedome from all temptation for it is the will of god we should be tryed but therein wee are taught to pray that god would not forsake vs in our temptations or giue vs vp wholly to the power of the deuill but that it may tend to our profit and not to our hurt as well in respect of grace as of saluation and so farre foorth was this promise accomplished to this church the due consideration whereof is most comfortable to god church and people teaching the not to feare the crosse in any temptation god will haue his church tryed but the faithfull therein need not to be dismayed for god by his promise hath taken away the euill and poyson of all tryals and temptations to them that haue care to keepe faith and a good conscience though they suffer a thousand crosses in this world neuer so long yes though they die vnder the crosse which may put comfort into the heart of any distressed soule whatsoeuer amp reuiue those that are oppressed with temptations againe in that this promise is not made simply and absolutely but with restraint hereby we are taught that the petitions of those persons which pray simply and absolutely to be freed from all temptations and aduersities are not according to god will and word for euery petition must depend vpon some promise of god but wee haue no absolute promise of freedome from all tryals and temptations but onely so farre foorth as they be euill and therefore in praying against temptations we must qualifie our petitions for temporall deliuerance according to the tenour of the promises of christ that is so farre forth as may most aduance god glorie and best further our saluation quest how can this great persecution bee called but an houre of temptation seeing it lasted yeeres answer in diverse respects it may bee so called first in regard of god pet with whom a thousand yeeres are but as one day and therefore yeers with god are but as one houre secondly in regard of that punishment which euery man by his sinnes deserueth in hell eternally thirdly in the affection of god people which were tryed when iacob serued laban seuen yeeres for rahell his affection made him thinke gen it was but a short time so when god children suffer for the name and gospel of christ the consideration thereof will make them thinke long afflictions to bee but short this affection caused paul to wish to himselfe eternall perdition for the glory of god in the saluation of the iewes rom the end of this phrase touching the shortnesse of time was to comfort this and all other churches in the time of this grieuous persecution for the consideration of the shortnesse of the time is a meanes to ease any affliction and to arme an impatient man with some measure of contentation iii point the prophecie or prediction of this affliction is in these wordes which will come on all the world to try them that dwell vpon the earth heere christ foretelleth a thing which was to come simply by himselfe and from himselfe not by the helpe of any cause or any man or angell and hereby hee prooues himselfe to be true god for it is a propertie and priuiledge of the true god of himselfe and by himselfe to foretell a thing to come before it can bee seene either in it selfe or in the causes thereof no man nor angell can so absolutely foretell that which is to come but in their predictions they first see the things present in their causes vnlesse they bee reuealed vnto them from god but some may here demand whether christs foreknowledge and prediction were the cause of this grieuous persecution answer not so for things come not to passe because of god foreknowledge thereof but because they would come to passe therefore god foreseeth amp foretelleth them there is a higher cause of all things then prescience and prediction to wit the good will and pleasure and decree of god so christ is said act to be deliuered to bee crucified by the determinate will and counsell of god and from the same eternall counsell did this persecution vnder traian originally proceed for the first cause of the euent of euery thing is god decree either ordaying or disposing the same it will be sayd if this be so then is god the author of sinne answer god forbid for the maner of god will and decree is diverse some things hee decreeth to cause and effect of himselfe and by himselfe as all good things some other things god decreeth to be effected by others as sinne and so euill things though they bee not according to his reuealed will yet they come in some sort from his wil amp decree for if he simply nilled the they could neuer be beside in god decree are set down not only the things to be done but also the means and circumstances therof as we may see in this persecutio the place and end are plainly noted this we must remember amp on the contrary take heed of the opinio of some protestant which hold and teach that sundry things come to passe god onely foreseeing them and no way decreeing or willing them as namely sinne but to giue vnto god a bare fore knowledge without a decree is to put vppon him an idle prouidence which the nature of god will not admit the end why christ alleadgeth this prophecie is to expound his former saying for it might bee asked why doth christ call this persecution the houre of temptation christ answereth because it wil certainly come to try them that dwel on earth where we may note what is the propertie of afflictions and persecutions be they publike or priuate namely they serue to discouer the state of mens hearts either by making manifest their faith repentance and feare of god or by detecting their impacience amp hypocrisie here is christs commandement to this church wherein consider first what hee inioyneth them then the reason thereof the thing he enioyneth is this hold fast that which thou hast that is hold as it were with both hands that little meaof faith and grace which thou hast receiued from me and in no wise part with the same this commandement hath beene before expounded chap verse the reasons to enforce this commandement are two one going before it in these wordes i come shortly that is either in the generall iudgement or by death vnto thee particularly before this reason is put a note of attention beholde to giue vs to vnderstand that the speedy comming of christ vnto vs either by death in particular or in iudgement generall is a matter of great moment neuer to be forgotten but aid vp amp treasured euen in the bottome of our hearts herein we must not flat our selues and say with the bad servant mat my master doth foreslowe his comming for that is the cause of so much wickednesse and impenitencie as is in the world but rather with an ancient ierome father thinke we euer heare the sound of his trumpet this dayly perswasion of the speedy comming of christ is of notable vse for first it will daunt the most desperate wretch that is and make him to tremble in himselfe and restraine him from many sinnes and if a man belong to god and be yet a loose liuer this perswasion will rowze him out of his sins and make him turne vnto god by vsing the meanes of repentance for who would not seeke to saue his soule if he were perswaded that christ were now comming to giue him his finall reward secondly if a man haue grace and haue repented and do beleeue this perswasio is a notable means to make him constant in euery good dutie both of pietie to god and of charitie towards his brother thirdly this serueth to comfort any person that is in affliction for when hee shall beleeue this which christ hath said i come shortly he cannot but thinke but his deliuerance is at hand for at his comming hee bringeth perfect redemption to all his elect the second reason is set after the commandement that no man take thy crowne that is the crowne of thy glory euen euerlasting life this must not be restrayned to the minister of this church taking it only for the crown of his ministery though it bee also vnderstood of him but the same must bee referred to the whole church as if our sauiour christ should say if thou holde not fast thy faith and other graces thou wilt loose the crowne of glorie that is ordayned for thee hence some gather that a man ordained to life may finally perish because another may haue that crowne which was ordained for him but this is a flat abuse of this and such like texts of scripture for the words are not absolute that a man may loose his crowne but conditionall hold fast or els thou shalt perish and loose eternall life though it bee ordained for thee now the vse of such speeches is not to signifie falling from grace but to shew vnto vs our owne weaknes in our selues that we might acknowledge that if wee were left of god wholly to our selues we could not but perish therefore they serue to stir vp the child of god to humble himselfe in the acknowledgement of his owne weakenesse vnto a carefull vsing of the meanes to come to saluation like as a father that takes his childe and sets him on a horse guiding the horse with one hand and holding him with the other and then saith vnto the child take heed least thou fall not meaning thereby that the childe shall fall but intending to make him sit faster amp to let him know that if he should leaue him he would fal secondly christ vseth such speeches that thereby hee may make his church perseuer in grace vnto the end for all exhortations and threatnings in god word are instruments of perseuerance in grace vnto god children because as god hath appointed who shall bee saued certainly so hee hath ordayned certaine meanes to bring the same to passe part whereof are exhortations amp threatnings which doe not import any finall relapse but serue as meanes amp causes of perseuerance and for this end doth christ here bid this church hold fast lest another take her crowne in this threatning wee may note that when god withdrawes his grace from one man or his blessings from any one people for the abuse thereof hee hath others ready to bestow the same vpo who will vse the same well when iudas was cut off from the apostleship matthias was chosen in his roome and when the iewes by infidelitie fell away from god he had the gentiles in store to ingraffe in their stead for the the arme of god is not shortned when any one people shall abuse his gospel he can giue it to another that will bring foorth the fruit thereof mat this must bee thought vpon for by god mercy wee are now god people and doe inioy his gospell but wee must not flat our selues herewith for if wee abuse the same wee must know that hee hath another nation in store whom wee now contemne whither hee can send his gospel and cause them to bring forth the plentifull fruits thereof wee therefore must imbrace and hold fast this blessing of god which now wee inioy and shew foorth the power of obedience or else god will take it from vs and we know not how neere this iudgement is seeing other particular iudgements haue not brought vs to repent and what else meane the rumors of war are they not god warnings bidding vs holde fast his gospel or else it will bee taken from vs although therefore wee loose all other things as honour riches lands or life it selfe yet let vs holde fast our crowne when the arke of god is gone no glorie is left sam verse him that ouercommeth will i make a pillar in the temple of my god amp he shall goe no more out and i will write vpon him the name of my god and the name of the citie of my god which is the new ierusalem which commeth downe out of heauen from my god and i will write vpon him my new name verse let him that hath an eare heare what the spirit saith vnto the churches these wordes are the conclusion of this epistle which containeth two parts first a promise in the twelfth verse secondly a commandement in the for the promise in it wee are to obserue two points the partie to whom it is made and the thing promised the partie is he that ouercommeth of whom we haue spoken before for this promise hath beene propounded sixe times for substance the same though in other tearmes yet here the very word ouercommeth doth giue vs to vnderstand that he that would haue his seruice pleasing to god must dispose himselfe to a battell or combate for ouercomming presupposeth a fight the enemy which he is to fight against are spirituall to wit his owne corrupt nature the wicked world and the deuill and in this spirituall combate a man must be a good souldier before hee can bee a good christian for all these enemy will seeke to draw him backe and hinder him so soone as he shall any way endeuour to please god indeed god could haue freed his servant from all temptations but hee will not it is god pleasure by temptations to haue his servant tryed whereby it is manifest that they are deceiued that imagine the state of a christian to be a freedome from all miseries and temptations or a state of ease wherein is no strife or trouble to disquiet the mind nay it is a souldiers condition in which he that would ouercome must wage a perpetuall battell against all his enemy both within him and without him and that vnto death the thing promised will i make a pillar in the house of my god and hee shall goe no more out heere christ doth most notably expresse the state and condition of eternall life in the description whereof he doth allude to the custome amp practise of man who minding to perserue the memorie of their names after their death vsed to errect durable pillars of wood or stone in some towne valley or mountain with their name engrauen or written thereon this practise is common in humane hystories and sam absolon wanting issue set vp a pillar with his owne name vpon it in the kings dale thereby to continue his remembrance with posteritie the meaning then is as if christ had said others for the continuing of their memorie after their death doe in some speciall place errect some durable pillar of wood or stone with their owne names written or engrauen thereon but to him that ouercommeth i will not set vp such a pillar but euen make him a pillar durable and euerlasting whose memorie shall alwayes continue he addeth further he shall bee a pillar in the temple of my god as if hee should say others set vp their pillars in valleyes and mountaines or such places where some notable exployt hath bin wrought but the place which i will choose saith christ is the temple of my god that is the church tryumphant which was figured by the temple in ierusalem and by the tabernacle as we may see heb and revelation for those were two places where god people worshipped him amp where god testified his presence in a speciall manner vnto his people and so in the true temple the kingdome of heauen god saints and angels doe worship him immediately where god is present with them in most glorious amp comfortable maner this then is christs meaning he shall not onely be a part of that temple but an excellent part euen a pillar in the triumphant church in heauen and to shew what is meant by this temple christ calleth it the temple of his god therby noting the highest heauen where obserue that god is called christes god which argueth inferioritie and therefore it must be vnderstood of christ as hee is man and as he is mediator in which respect he receiueth from his father all his offices and power to execute the same but as christ is god he is equall with his father and receiueth nothing from him and to instruct is yet further heerein christ saith hee shall goe no more out when man erected pillars for their memoriall in processe of time they would weare away and therefore they caused them to be renewed or els their remembrance thereby would not continue but he that is once made a meber of the tryumphant church shall there remaine for euer and euer and no time shall euer come wherein he shall cease to bee a pillar in the same further in the pillars erected by man their names were written or engrauen and to this practise christ alludeth saying that hee that is made a pillar in the triumphant church shall haue names written on him these names are three i the name of my god that is i will make it manifest that this man is indeed the son of god and that god is all in all vnto him the second name is the name of the cittie of my god by cittie he meaneth not the tryumphant church but the place where the tryumphant church shall be to wit the highest heauen as it is taken revelation so that hereby christ would teach vs thus much that hee which ouercommeth shall bee knowne to be a cittizen of heauen and that the priuiledges of that kingdom belong vnto him and lest any should doubt what is meant by the cittie of god christ here described it first by the resemblance thereof calling it ierusalem because that cittie in regard of the temple especially was a figure of the kingdome of heauen secondly he calleth it the new ierusalem that is the place of the tryumphant church euen the highest heauen which is not called new in respect of being for it was from the beginning but in respect of the manner of reuealing and manifesting it for in the old testament the new ierusalem was reuealed to the iewes onely and that obscurely but vnder the kingdome of christ it is more fully reuealed not only to the iewes but to all the world thirdly he addeth that it doth now descend out of heauen from his god therein answering to an obiection for it might bee said this temple of god in heauen is so farre off that wee cannot ascend or attaine vnto it how then shall we come thither christ answereth that this new ierusalem commeth downe from god out of heauen quest how will some say can heauen come out of heauen answer as paul saith of christ that hee was crucified among the galatians before their eyes because his crucifying was so liuely represented vnto them in the ministerie of the gospel so here heauen may be said to come downe from god out of heauen in regard of the preaching of the gospel which doth most visibly represent and set open heauen vnto vs that god people may enter therein by the faithfull embracing whereof we become cittizens with the saints and of the household of god ephe the third name which shall bee written on him is christs new name whereby is not meant any title of christ as iesus mediatour ampc but the dignitie power and glorie of christ quest how can that bee called new seeing hee had power and glorie from all eternitie answer it is called newe because it is receiued of christ as hee is mediator god incarnate beeing that which was giuen to him after his death and passion standing in his rising againe in his ascension and sitting at the right hand of his father hereof paul saith philipp god gaue him a name aboue euery name that is dignitie power and glorie as it is expounded heb and this glorie power and dignitie will christ giue to them that ouercome and thus we haue eternall life set out vnto vs by the authour of life himselfe the summe whereof is this that hee which ouercommeth shall bee made a true member of the tryumphant church and there continue for euer and shall haue three names written on him the name of god hauing this made euident that hee is the childe of god the name of god cittie being made partaker of the priuiledges of god kingdome of heauen the newe name of christ communicating with christ in his glorie and maiestie and christ doth thus describe life eternall vnto vs for speciall causes which may bee these i to comfort them which haue care to keepe faith and a good conscience and to encourage them against all hindrances and miseries of this life for what can more harten a man in good duties than to set before him his recompence and reward wherby we learne that in all miseries and trobles that may befall vs for the maintenance of true religion and good conscience we must comfort our selues and not faint and to encourage vs herein wee are carefully to propound and set before vs the due consideration of life eternal for this it was that caused heb moses to despise worldly honour and to choose affliction with the people of god wee must also looke vnto christ heb who for the ioy that was set before him endured the crosse and despised shame souldiers that are vncerten of any reward are yet content vnder their generall to adventure their liues at his command how much more then ought christian souldiers to fight manfully and stand fast in all troubles for christs sake who hath set before them such a great reward secondly it is thus described to bring god people to a view and taste of life eternall that thereby they may the more affect it many cast off all care of religion and good conscience for the present delights of earthly things they can see no goodnesse nor pleasure in spirituall things the sweetnesse of earthly pleasures puts mens mouthes out of taste in regard of any rellish of life eternall but this must not be so with vs wee must bee of moses minde who desired to see the land of canaan when he was not permitted to enter into it and therevpon god tooke him vp into mount nebo and shewed it vnto him so considering christ hath thus largely described this kingdome vnto vs wee must labour to comprehend in our vnderstandings and in our hearts to possesse by faith something of life eternall though we cannot as yet fully inherite the ioyes and pleasures thereof thirdly it is thus described to teach vs to practise pauls rule tim namely to passe through all the miseries and troubles of this world and to take holde of eternall life this is a most necessarie dutie but yet little practised man with both hands lay hold vpon the things of this world vpon riches and pleasures but who considere h what is prepared by christ in heauen for them that ouercome and who laboureth to lay holde thereof and to keepe that sure though he loose all things else lastly this description of eternall life here serueth to make the people of god to feare no death thogh it were most cruell and terrible for death is but a straite doore whereby the childe of god must passe to all glorie and happinesse when he shal be made a pillar in god temple thus much generally of the thing promised nowe followe in particular the parts thereof first whereas christ promiseth to make them that ouercomme pillars and chiefe members in the church tryumphant hereby we are taught to labour to become true members of god church in this life for life eternall must begin here and they that would be pillars in his church tryumphant must now become members of his church militant for not onely ministers amp teachers are pillars in god church though they be chiefe pillars therein but euery one yong and old man and woman that is a true beleeuer and thus shalt thou become a pillar in god church on earth by maintaining amp vpholding the gospel of christ which thou must doe partly by teaching it to those whom thou article bound to teach within the compasse of they calling and partly by good example of life and conuersation and chiefly by a true and bold profession thereof not onely in time of peace but euen in the greatest tryals and afflictions secondly hee addeth hee will make him a pillar in the temple of god that is in the church tryumphant for in the new testament wee haue no other temples but god church tryumphant and militant hereby then we must learne to renounce that ignorant opinion of the world who iudge euery materiall church to be the temple of god and as holy as the church in ierusalem was but the distinction of place and place in regard of holinesse which was vnder the law is taken away by christ the house is now as holy as the church churches indeed must be regarded and maintained not for holinesse but for order sake now man may euery where offer the calues of their lips and lift vp pure hands from a pure heart vnto god thirdly i will writ vpon him the name of my god that is whereas god the father is my god first i will also communicate vnto him the same name of god and he shall haue god euen my god to be his god also by this it is plaine that no man can haue fellowship with god but by christ wee must not looke to haue immediate fellowship with god of our selues or by any other but by christ god heares not god helpes not god saues not but by christ nay god is no god vnto vs out of christ for first he is a god vnto christ and then in him and by him vnto vs therefore if wee would call vpon god wee must call on him through christ if wee would giue him thankes it must bee in and by christ for in him onely are wee heard if we would know god it must bee by christ for hee is the very engrauen image of his father in whom is manife ed the wisedome iustice and mercie of god in him dwelleth the fulnesse of the god head and to conceiue of god out of christ is to make god an idoll in the braine lastly if we would receiue any temporall blessing from god it must bee in and by christ as meate drinke and clothing for if wee receiue them from god out of christ wee are but vsurpers of them and the vse thereof shall turne to our further condemnation fourthly he saith i will write on him the name of the cittie of my god that is he shal haue the priuiledges of the kingdom of heauen we do all desire and looke for the inheritance of god kingdome after this life therefore heere wee must liue as citizens of god kingdome conforming our selues to god commandements abandoning all sin and so liuing in faith and a good conscience vnto the end that after this life we may assuredly perswade our selues we shall be made partakers of the priuiledges of this kingdo fiftly it is said this citie of god is the new ierusalem which commeth downe out of heauen from god that is by the preaching of the gospel hereby we are taught more carefully to seeke to attaine to the kingdome of god for behold god endlesse mercie herein our sinnes shut heauen gates against vs but by the blood of christ he hath opened them and by the ministery of the gospell hee makes heauen come downe vnto man god therefore would not see vs damned hee hath made open away euen a new and liuing way whereby wee may come to heauen and escape hell god hath brought downe heauen among man wee must therfore with the people in john baptists time violently enter into this kingdom and striue to take it by force matthew lastly hee saith i will write my new name on him that is i wil make him pertaker of that glorie and digni ie wherewith i my selfe am glorified since my death and resurrection marke this all that after this life must haue christs new name must in this life become new creatures so paul saith corinthian if any man bee in christ he is a new creature and againe gal neither circumcision nor vncircumcision auayleth any thing but a new creation would we then partake with christ in his glorie we must heere bee partaker of his grace herein standeth true religion to become new creatures and not in bare knowledge and profession we must therefore put of ephe the old man which is corrupt with sinne and be renued in the spirit of our m ds putting on the new man which after god is created in righteousnesse and true holinesse but if we content our selues with the image of the olde man wherein wee were borne wee shall neuer partake of christs glorie for this new name must be giuen to the new creature the old man and it cannot agree together this conclusion hath been handled in in the former epistles heere followeth the seuenth and last epistle to the church of the laodiceans whereto is prefixed a commaundement vnto john whereby hee is authorised to pen the same in these words and vnto the angell of the church of the laodiceans write which hath beene handled before the epistle it selfe hath three parts a preface the substance or matter of the epistle and the conclusion the preface is this verse wherein is set downe in whose name this epistle is written to wit christs who is heere described by two arguments i hee is called amen which is that faithfull and true witnesse ii he is the begining of the creatures of god for the first amen is an hebrew aduerbe of asseueration signifying as much as verily truely or certainely this title is giuen to christ amp the reason thereof is expressed in the wordes following which are a full exposition of the same amen is that faithfull and true witnesse so that christ is called amen to testifie that hee is a witnesse a faithfull witnesse and a true witnesse which title was giuen to christ in the verse of the first chapter where it was expounded and reasons rendred why hee is so called vnto which title is heere added that hee is a true witnesse because hee speakes the truth according as euerie thing is in it selfe without errour deceit or falshood for that which hee receiueth from his father is the will of his father which is the rule of all truth that we may come to the right vse of this argument we must first search out the ends for which christ is here called amen that a faithfull and true witnesse which by the contents of the epistle we may easily gesse to be these first to set forth himselfe vnto the angell of this church an example and patern of fidelitie in his ministrie in the duties wherof hee had been slacke and negligent christ therefore by his owne example would teach him without respect of persons to instruct the church of god truely and faithfully how this dutie is to bee performed hath beene shewed before chap and not onely to the angell of this church of laodicea but also to all the church and to all them that professe themselues to be his members doth christ propound himselfe an example of two most worthy vertues faith and truth for the first faith is a vertue whereby a man makes good all his lawful words promises oths leagues compacts and bargaines whatsoeuer so as his word is as sure as an obligation as we vse to speake truth is another vertue whereby a man without fraude lye or deceit speaketh the truth from his heart that is necessarie to be knowne for his owne good the glorie of god and the good of others wee therefore must set before our eyes this president of our sauiour christ as he is a witnesse yes a faithfull and true witnesse without any faming or falshood so let vs labour to shew our selues faithfull in all lawful promises and true in all our speeches that so by these vertues we may be knowne to be like vnto christ through our whole liues and conuersations secondly christ is here called amen to induce this church of laodicia to apply effectually vnto her selfe the word of god whether threatnings or promises this church had beene negligent in the duties of religion which came for want of applying god word vnto the selues the right maner of applying god word is this in god word we are to consider the lawe and the gospell in the lawe there are commaundements and threatnings now a man must apply to his owne person and life god commaundements particularly that thereby he may come to know his particular sinnes then hee must also apply the threatnings of god vnto himselfe that thereby hee may bee humbled through the sight of his misery and so made fit amp capable of god grace thus the prodigall son applyed the law vnto himselfe when he sayd luke i haue sinned against heauen and against thee and am no more worthy to bee called thy son so did daniel daniell and ezrah by applying the law vnto themselues humble themselues and their people for this is the way to humble any man amp to make him fit to receue grace for the law is our schoolmaster to bring vs to christ gal and the want of this speciall application of the law was a cause of the dulnesse of the laodicians and is also of our slacknesse in religion at this day secondly the gospel also must bee applyed not onely by beleeing it to bee true as the papists teach but also by applying vnto our selues particularly the promises of righteousnesse and life euerlasting by christ a cording as paul saith philip i desire to win christ amp to be found in him not hauing mine owne righteousnesse which is of the law but that which is through the faith of christ verse let vs saith he as many as bee perfect bee thus minded teaching euery one this speciall dutie of particular application for as saint john saith he that by faith doth not apply the promises of the gospell particularly to himselfe ioh makes god a lyer and the want of this application is the cause of negligence in religion and of so many luke warme gospellers as be at this day for it is not sufficient to know the gospel to be true or to bee able to teach it vnto others vnlesse we can thus apply it to our selues this then serues to prooue that iustifying faith must not onely be a bare assent to the truth of the gospel but a speciall faith which doth apply particularly vnto a man those promises which are propounded concerning righteousnes and life euerlasting by christ the second argument and title wherby christ is described is this that hee is the beginning of the creatures of god the meaning whereof is that christ is he that is the creator of all god creatures that were created so it is sayd column by him all things were created in heauen and in earth and though this be true yet i doubt not but that christ is here called the beginning of the creatures of god for a further respect namely because he is the beginning of the new creature in regeneration so it is sayd ephe wee are the workema ship of god created in christ vnto good workes so that euery regenerate person is a new creature to which purpose it is said of christ esai when he shall giue his soule an offer for sin he shall see his seed ampc because christ is the roote and seed of all that are borne againe how is christ will some say the beginning of a new creature answer two wayes i as he is the author of regeneration for hee is the cause whereby a man is regenerate in which respect he is called the father of eternitie esay and againe he saith behold esai i and the children whom thou hest giuen mee secondly because hee is the matter and roote out of which a new creature doth spring and so the church is called ephe bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh alluding vnto adam and eue who were a type of christ amp his church for as eue was taken out of adams side so the church and euery member thereof sprang of the blood that issued out of christs side which was of infinite merit being the blood of him that was god the end why christ in this epistle is called the beginning of god creatures as we see by the contents thereof is to meete with this common vice of this church that they had more care to seeme to bee religious then to bee religious indeed now ch ist would by this his title giue them to vnderstand that their chiefest ca e must bee to become new creatures indeed and no doubt this is the fault of our dayes our care is lesse for the power of godlinesse then for the name thereof wee more respect shew than substance and shadow than truth it selfe which ought not to bee for if wee would bee in christ we must become new creatures to exercise our selues in the word and sacraments and prayers are good in their kind but without this new creation they are not sufficient to saluation secondly hereby he would meet with this speciall pride of theirs whereby they did boast themselues to bee rich and to want nothing but christ tels them that there was no dignitie in any thing out of this whereby in christ they are made newe creatures we therefore must learne by them not to bee puffed vp with outward priuiledges of nobili ie wealth strength or such like as many doe but hee that would reioyce must reioyce in this that hee is a new creature in christ iesus further by calling himselfe the beginning of the creatures of god christ would teach them and vs that hee doth loue his church and preserue the same eue was created by the hand of god not a part from adam but of his ribbe for this end that he might loue and protect her amp that she might reuerence and serue him euen so euery new creature springeth out of christs heart blood which god hath so wrought that wee might know how christ hath loued vs and that wee ought to magnifie and honour him adam was not the author but the matter onely whereof eue was made but christ is both the author and the matter of our regeneration wherin appereth his exceeding loue vnto vs and looke as the root spends it selfe for the preseruation of the braunches so did ghrist spend his owne blood for the saluation of his church fourthly whereas hee is called the beginning of his regeneration hence wee may gather that the doctrine of the church of rome is erronious which teach that a man in his first conuersion hat vse of his naturall free will and can dispose himselfe in the act of his regenera io but the creature of god cannot dispose himselfe in his creation now euerie man that is regenerate is the new creature of god and therefore hath no power to dispose himselfe in his new creation verse i know thy workes thou article neither cold nor hot i would thou werest cold or hot verse therefore because thou article luke warme and neither cold nor hot it will come to passe that i shall spew thee out of my mouth in these words and so forward to the verse is contayned the substance or matter of this epistle and it hath two parts a dispraise verse and counsell verse they are dispraised for two vices first luke warmenesse verse secondly for their pride verse i know thy workes this is a generall reproofe signifying thus much all thy workes are knowne vnto mee and i vtterly dislike them then followeth the reason of this dislike thou article neither cold nor hot which is a comparison borrowed from water wherof there be three sorts hot cold and luke warme now hot and cold water doe not so much annoy the stomacke as luke warme water doth they are sometimes comfortable to the stomacke but luke warme water doth disquiet it till it bee cast vp and to these three kindes of water hee compareth three sorts of man by cold water he vnderstanding such as are enemy to reliligion as at this day are the iewes and turkes and other barbarous people by hot water he vnderstandeth man that are earnest and zealous of the truth so that when hee sayth of this church thou article neitheir cold nor hot his meaning is thou article neither an open enemie nor truely zealous of my gospell i would thou werest cold or hot christ wisheth not simply that they were enemy vnto him but onely in respect of that estate of luke warmnes in which they were as if hee should say i had le er thou werest either cold or hot than thus luke warme as thou article for if we should vnderstand it simply wee should make christ to desire that man should bee his enemy by luke warme man he vnderstandeth a people who are in shew god church but in truth wante the power of godlynesse and the zeale of the spirit because thou article such saith christ to this church therefore i will spew thee out of my mouth that is looke as hee that hath drunke luke warme water cannot abide it on his stomacke but must needs spew it vp againe so am i wearie of this thy securite i cannot abide it and therefore will i cast thee off from all fellowship with mee and make of thee which article a church in shew to be no church thus we see their fault namely luke warmenesse the greatnesse whereof hee aggrauates first by comparing it with the extreames cold and hot both which he preferreth before it as may appeare by his wish and desire and secondly by the punishment thereof namely vtter reiection hereby wee must examine our selues whither this fault may not iustly be charged vpon vs after due triall it will appeare that wee are guiltie of this sinne the which that it may the better appear i will note the seuerall kindes of luke warme christians the first luke warme professor is the papist as the tenour of his religion and the manner of his worship of god doth plainely shewe for hee doth part stakes with christ in the matter of saluation affirming that he receiueth fro christ to work out his owne saluation and so assumeth part of christs glorie to himselfe secondly all time seruers are luke warme gospellers that is all such as alter their religion with time and state and of this sort are the bodie of our people who professe themselues to be of the same religion the prince is of which sheweth euidently what they will doe in time to come namely turne with the time as their forefathers haue done the third sort are the followers of nicodemus who came to christ by night onely that is such as say and thinke that they may goe to masse with their body if they keep their hearts vnto god these halt betweene two opinions and neither serue god nor ba ll fourthly all mediators such as will make pacification between the religion of the protestant and the papists so holding our religion as not caring o embrace theirs also because they think they differ not in substance but in circumstances onely let these pretend what they will they are in heart laoditians fiftly all worldlings which as christ sayth luke serue god and mammon god and the world by setting their heart vpon riches these man abound euerie where for though they heare god in the ministrie of his word and as it were touch him in the sacrament yet their hearts are farre from him running after their couetousnesse ezech and who are such their consciences will witnesse yes their behauiour proclaimes it to the world for though they wil heare the word yet their wit and strength is spent vpon the world and the thinges thereof sixtly those that professe christs reliligion in outward actions of his worship but yet in their liues giue themselues to the common sinnes of the time some to drunkennesse to fornication to couetousnesse or crueltie some to this sinne and some to that to this sort we must referre those that in word approoue religion and yet their hearts delight is in garnishing themselues with the monstrous brutish and irreligious formes of strange and foreign attire these spend their time and wit in the decking of their body and so suffer their soules to goe to wracke when as apparell should bee an occasion to put vs in minde of a shame through sinne and by modest attire we should expresse the vertues of the heart but these hereby professe the vanitie of their minde now though we be not intangled with these grosse sinnes yet we cannot excuse our selues from this sinne of luke warmenesse for the want of zeale of god glorie of loue to his truth of care to obey his commaundements and to keepe good conscience the want of hatred of sinne what argue all these but luke warmenes herein wee must lay our hand vpon our mouth with iob for wee cannot plead with god no not for this common sinne but that we may be out of all doubt that this sinne of luke warmenesse hath infected our congregations as it did this church of laodicea i will make it plaine by the signes thereof which are common amonge vs that so wee may the better know our fearefull estate the first signe is negligence in the duties of that true religion which we professe this appeareth sundrie waies for first howsoeuer wee come to the assemblies where the word is preached yet fewe doe profite there by increase in the knowledge of that religion which is taught and in the amendment of life this may any man see to be true that hath halfe an eye to looke into the state of our assemblies and mens owne consciences will heerein witnesse against them againe where god word is ordinarily heard there are verie fewe that spend any time in searching out and trying whether the thinges bee so or not which are taught them nay man wil not be at cost to buy a bible and if they haue one yet they will not take paines to reade the same at least in such a constant course as they ought to doe thirdly the lord sabbath is broken for though most man at set times will come into the congregation yet there is not that priuate sanctifying of the sabbath after the congregations are dissolued which god word requireth but man betake themselues to their own affaires and to outward delights to omit those that haue no care at all of sanctifying the sabbath in any sort now these persons must needs want both knowledge obedience and all sound grace that will not set apart some time wherein they should employ themselues in god word and by these signes it is euident that there is a greeuous disease of negligence in the duties of religion that infects our congregations now where this negligence is though coldnesse be not there cannot be zeale and so luke warmnesse must needs abound ii signe of luke warmenesse the religion of most man is this in the generall calling of a christian they shew religion but in the affaires of their particular callings where is religion in the church they are good christians but in practise of the duties of their particular callings who sheweth his religion for when as man should practise their callings according to god word and true godlynesse they follow the desires of their owne hearts little conscience is made of lying and oppression that loue and plaine dealing which ought to be between man and man is wanting which prooueth them plainely to bee luke warme gospellers iii signe there bee many that professe themselues to bee luke warme neither hot nor cold for though all generally come to the hearing of the word and the receiuing of the sacraments yet many when they see some make conscience to become answerable in some measure to the word which they heare and the sacraments which they receiue doe take vp in their mouthes this slaunder of precizenesse against them mocking them for doing that which in the word amp sacraments theselus profes shuld be don these man will not be enemy to the religion of christ and they professe themselues not to bee zealous by reproaching zeale in others therefore they doe more than these laodiceans did euen professe themselues to bee luke warme for hee that reproacheth another for zeale in religion brandeth himselfe with this sinne of luke warmenesse and who knowes not how many of this ort are euerie where i dare with good conscience say our congregations generally consist of such now marke what followeth hereupon first that our common professors of religion are in worser case than heathen man iewes and turkes that knowe not christ this christ teacheth in preferring cold persons before the luke warm as if hee should say i had rather thou werest a pagan than a professor without zeale and pet saint peter to this purpose speaking of such saith it had beene better they had neuer knowne the way of truth than after they haue known it not to obey the commaundements of god so that vnlesse there be further matter in vs than knowledge and bare profession our case is worse than the case of iewes and turkes religion knowne will not make thee better than them but it is zeale and obedience that must preferre thee before them secondly from the consideration of our estate i gather that wee are in danger to be spewed out of the mouth of christ as luke warme water out of the stomacke this is the punishment heere threatned which was written for our instruction that we might know where luke warmenesse takes place there this punishment will follow wee may flat our selues as the man in the old world did amp thinke all is well neuer regarding till the iudgement come but the truth is that in regard of this sinne we are in danger to bee cut off from the church and from true societie with christ god can doe this sundrie wayes either by bereauing vs of his gospell and making vs as the heathen or by sending the enemie among vs to destroy and root vs out of this land and euen in our neighbor countreys and townes hee sets spectacles before vs that by them wee may see how hee can spew vs ou amp cut vs off from being a people and thus much of the first fault namely luke warmenesse here is the second sin of this church namely spirituall pride the wordes depend vpon the former as a reason thereof before he charged the with deadnes in religion and here he painteth out the cause thereof namely spirituall pride of hart as if hee should say thou thinkest thus within thy selfe i am rich for it is the manner of the scripture to expresse the thoughts of man by their speeches because the thoughts of man are as euident to christ as any mans speeches can bee to another in that christ doth expresse mens secret thoughts and propound the same in this booke wee may hence gather that it is a part of canonicall scripture for it is a priuiledge of the scriptures to set down the thoughts of countreys of churches amp of particular man euen as they coceiue them this can no man doe in any booke of his owne deuising and hence wee may gather an argumet against athiests that scriptures are the word of god because they reueale mens secret thoughts nowe followeth the thought it selfe of the angell and people of this church i am rich that is i haue many excellent gifts and graces of god spirite by this effect he expresseth their spirituall pride in ouerweening their estate before god this is a common sinne in the world and euer hath been christ sayd luke he came not to call the righteous but sinners to repentance by righteous meaning such as think themselues righteous and the luke proud pharisie in his prayer which hee conceiued in his heart thought himselfe farre better than the poore publican or other man and paul corinthian bringeth in the corinthians thinking proudly of themselues saying we are full and made rich ampc this sinne takes place in the papists at this day who perswade themselus that they can satisfie god iustice by temporall works and fulfill the law of god and merite for themselues and for others to come to our selues this same proud thought hath place among vs first wee think we are rich in regard of knowledg both yong and old scorne to be catechized because they would not seeme to be ignorant some sticke not to professe this pride by bragging thus that they know as much for substance as any man can teach them when as indeed they know nothing but that wich nature wil teach a man secondly man plead that they haue a most firme saith so as they neuer doubted of god mercie which is nothing but the presumption of a proude heart for true faith is troubled with doubting thirdly man will professe that they are rich in loue both towards god and their neighbours when as they loue the world and the pleasures thereof more than christ and so haue no true loue of god in their harts fourthly to make more plain that this spirituall pride raignes in mens harts mark this let any bodily calamity be made knowne to a man that is newly befallen him oh how is hee presently perplexed but let god minister out of his word make knowne vnto him his inward fearfull estate that by reason of sinne hee is in danger of god iudgements and a firebrand of hell hee is not affraide worldly newes doth affright man much when as the threatnings of the word mooue them nothing what argueth this but that their hearts are fore stalled with this false conceit i am rich the drunkard in his drunkennesse the filthie person in his vncleannesse and euerie man in his sinne sootheth himselfe with this god is mercifull i am rich and in his fauour hee will not condemne me well it being thus manifest that spirituall pride is our common sin we must labour to see it in our selues and vse all good meanes that it may be remooued the means follow afterwards and increased with goods or am made rich so the words are these words are added onely for amplification to shew that this church had not any smal portion but an exceeding measure of spirituall pride the doubling of the words sheweth the strength of this conceit whats the cause that this church was growne to such an height of pride answer it may be it was knowledge wherewith no doubt the angell of this church and many therin did abound now the holy ghost saith corinthian that knowledge pusseth vp this is true in all places great knowledg without speciall grace great pride this is the sinne of the schooles of learning where knowledge abounds there pride of heart abounds and man are puffed vp according to the measure of their gifts vnlesse by his grace and the sight of their sins god doe humble them and haue need of nothing this is a further signe of their great pride that they thought they needed not the helpe of any thinge or any person beside themselues and all such as thinke they haue no need of the blood of christ for the washing away of their sinnes doe surfet and abound with this spirituall pride of heart this serues further to conuince our congregations of this damnable spirituall pride if any one be sicke in bodie hee streight sendeth to the phisitian but not one of a thousand seeketh to the minister till the pange of death draw neere the soules disease by sin is not felt there is no complaint for want of the blood of christ but if wee would be emptied of this pride wee must labour to see that wee stand in neede of christ and euerie droppe of his blood till such time as wee feele that in vs there is no goodnesse in our hearts vvee are but the proude laodiceans and our case is wretched and damnable and knowest not how thou article wretched and miserable and poore and blinde and naked christ intending to strike this sin of pride to the verie heart doth here set downe the true cause thereof to wit ignorance as if hee should say thou knowest not thine owne naturall estate as thou article borne of adam out of christ and therefore thou article proude and thy pride maketh thee luke warme then he sheweth whereof they were ignorant namely of their naturall estate for the first christ making ignorance the cause of their pride teacheth vs that pride is not the first sin that euer was in the world as many both papists and others haue thought true it is pride is a great and mother sinne and the cause of many fowle iniquities but yet ignorance is a mother sin wherof pride springeth the cause why any person swelles with pride in himselfe is ignorance of his owne naturall estate by this then wee are taught to learne to knowe our owne estate what wee are by nature in our selues without christ for that is the way to pull downe our hearts for this cause the prophets of god vsed to call man to a searching of themselues zeph when they would bring the people to humilitie and grace that man seeing their estate by reason of their sinnes to bee damnable might bee humbled and caused to forsake themselues and come vnto christ and surely till such time as man bee humbled for their sinnes they will neuer get sound grace but be as the proud pharisie hypocrits and dissemblers though they haue much knowledg but when a man hath searched his naturall estate then besides knowledg of himselfe come other most excellent graces as humilitie the feare of god and true obedience with good conscience and therefore first of all let vs labour to be acquainted with our own estate in our selues amp with our personall sins amp with god iudgmets due vnto vs for them for this is the ground of true grace the spots and blemishes of our body we can soone espy and wipe away and why should wee bee lesse carefull of our soules which be farre better that christ might fully make knowne vnto them their ignorance of theselues it pleaseth him to desrcibe to the their naturall estate amp so proportionally the naturall condition of all churches amp of all people which is the state of mans miserie this he propoundeth two waies first generally in these wordes and knowest not how thou article wretched and miserable then by the parts thereof which be three pouertie blindnesse and nakednesse for the first the word translated wretched signifieth one subiect to calamities griefes and in a word to all miseries and that we may know who is thus wretched i will enter into a description of mans miserie whereof that we may conceiue aright two things are to bee considered first the roote and fountaine thereof for therein wee shall best see what miserie meaneth this root is originall sinne and it hath two braunches first that particular transgression whereby adam sinned which was not only the sinne of his person but also of the whole nature of man spreading it self to all his posterity christ excepted secondly the defacing of god image and the corrupting of mans heart which by reason of the fall of our first parents hath in it a pronesse vnto all sin both in will affection and in all the faculties of the soule in these two stands originall sin and in them and with them must wee conceiue of mans misery as in the root thereof secondly we must conceiue of mans misery vnder the forme of punishmet hauing relation to the first sin of adam amp to the corruption of ech mans nature therby receiued the punishent of sin must be considered sundry waies according to the diverse kind of mans being either in this world or after for it is either in this life or at the end of this life or after this life and so accordingly is misery to be considered now of the punishments in this life some concerne the whole man some the parts of man some his estate punishmets concerning the whole man bee of two sorts the first is subiection to the wrath of god whereby a man since adams fall is made the child of wrath a misery of all miseries amp yet the more greeuous because without some grace a man cannot discern amp see the same the second is a bondage vnder the diuell wherby a man in his mind will amp affections is subiect euery way to the will of the diuell which though we cannot describe yet wee may thus conceiue of it the regenerate man saith i sin but i would not sin the naturall man saith i sin and i will sin it is my nature to sin and my delight and this was the state of this church punishments concerning the parts of man bee either miseries of his soule or of his body the miseries of his soule be these first in the vnderstanding ignorance of god will and in sundry madnesse and foolishnesse and in all man pain and difficulty both to learn amp remember whatsoeuer is good which was not in man by creation in the conscience also be accusations secret feares and terrours in the will is rebellion to god will in all affections peruersnesse all which are miseries of the soule the body also hath these miseries first it is subiect to all infirmities sicknesses diseases and aches which are so many as all the bookes of phisitians neither doe nor can record the same secondly mans body is mortal amp subiect to teporal deth which no man can possibly auoid or preuent by all the article and skill in the world punishments of mans estate concerne either his goods or calling in goods there bee these miseries want of things necessary for by reason of sin it is a punishment amp in it owne nature a curse and all the hurts that come by the creatures for their enmity towards man amp towards one another as also their subiection to vanitie all these be miseries and the punishments of mans sinne in mans calling there is miserie for therein man is subiect to trouble to losses and sorow which come as a punishment of mans first sinne and all these be the miseries of man in this life at the end of this life comes bodily death the separation of soule and bodie asunder which in it selfe is a most fearfull curse for so it is the verie gate of hell but after this life is the accomplishmet of all miseries amp that is eternal destruction and condemnation in hell fire which to be the end of all misery appeares by this because it is a separation of mans person from the societie amp presence of god and an enduring of god wrath in the whole person euen in the place of the diuell and damned soules amp that not for a time but for euer and euer eternally and thus we see what punishment is and answerably what misery is wherby we may see what it is to be wretched namely in a word to be subiect to al miseries whether we consider the in the r ot thereof originall sin or vnder the forme of punishment in this life in the whole person and in soule amp body seuerally in goods and calling at the end of this life and in the world to come the proper end that moues christ to say to this church she knew not that shee was wretched is this to teach this church and in them vs and all churches to learne to knowe their owne miseries to feele the same and to be touched in conscience for them we therfore must learne not to atter our selus with hope of our good state but labor to see our miserie both in sin amp the punishment thereof and seeing it striue to be touched with it that we may crie with the iewes act what shal we do to be saued for till such time as this in some measure be wrought in vs we shal be but luke warme professors hauing a shew of godlines but wanting the power thereof the true sight of our miserie is the gift and grace of god but yet we must vse all good means that we may come to see the same amp to be touched with it that so we may haue hearts hereby fit to receiue the gospell which containes the remedie of this our miserie and miserable that is worthy to be pitied this is added not to set downe another thing but to expres the greatnes of their misery as if he should say thy misery is not small but so great and so greeuous as indeed thou article in that regard to be pitied of all man hence we learne that we must not despise parties miserable by reason of their sins or scorne and contemne them but contrariwise lament amp pity them when dauid saw man sin and so pull heapes of miseries vpon them psalm he shed river of tears the lord makes it a good mans property ezek to mourne for the abhominations of the people ieremie ier for the sins of the people wished his head were full of water and iust lot pe greeued his righteous hart for the abhominations of sodome it was the fault of the corinthians which paul reprooueth that when the incestuous man had sinned that greeuous sinne corinthian they were not humbled but puffed with contempt against the partie and it is a fault in sundry man at this daye that they are not humbled in themselues when they see other man sin we must not do so but shew the grace we haue aboue others in being greeued for the miseries which man without grace by their sins pull dayly vpon them thus much of their miserie in generall the partes of their miserie are three which christ noteth particularly that if it were possible he might cause this church to lay aside this damnable pride for these in all man are maine miseries the first is pouertie and poore that is properly one that hath not a rag to his back nor bread to his mouth vnlesse hee begge the same of others but here it is taken for one that is spiritually poore which pouerty wee shall better conceiue if we do vnderstand what be true spirituall riches true riches be god grace and sauor in christ as the pardon of sinne and life euerlasting the poore man therefore is hee that wanteth god fauour for the remission of his sins and the gift of eternall life amp hath in him no good thing that is acceptable to god but in regard of his soule is as silly and poore as any beggar in regard of his bodie the end why christ calleth this church poore is to beat downe the proud conceit of her owne good estate and to cause her to feele her spirituall pouertie and so become poore in spirit and we in them are likewise taught to labour to feele our owne pouertie how by nature there is no goodnesse in vs but wee are vtterly destitute of the grace and fauor of god that so we may goe out of our selues and in regard of our selues euen despaire of our saluation for till this pouertie of spirit be wrought in vs wee may make a shew in profession heare the word and receiue the sacraments but we shall neuer ha e sound grace and blessed were our estate if wee could lay aside that diuelish pride which puffeth vp our hearts and become poore in spirite then were wee in the right way to receiue the gospell and the graces thereof but till we be beggars in our selues wee neuer begin to be rich in christ howe can christ truely charge this church with pouertie for the laodiceans were a rich people and had great store of wealth answer true it is they were rich in wealth as history shew and yet poore to god for all honour and wealth in the world is nothing without the grace and fauor of god in christ paul saith column wee are compleat in christ forth of him therfore we haue nothing to the corinthians hee saith co all thinges are yours and you christs and christ is god but nothing is ours till we haue christ and christ vs as it was with this church so it is with all other euerie person and all people are but poore and beggarly if they want christ and therefore if god haue giuen any man riches and wealth hee must lay this good foundation vse them as helps to further his saluation for by them hee may attaine to the meanes of saluation and also shew forth the fruits of faith but they that haue wealth and vse it otherwise shall finde it turne to their deeper condemnation the second part of their misery is blindnesse quest how can they be sayd to be blinde for they had a learned teacher no doubt that both was able and did teach the will of god and the people likewise knew the points of religion and beleeued the gospell answer they had knowledge indeed but yet they were blinde first because they knew not their owne estate if a man had all skill in all arts and sciences amp great knowledge in the word yet if he know not himselfe in some measure he is but a blinde man secondly because they did not knowe god in christ they knewe no doubt that there was a god and that christ was a sauiour but they could not apply it to themselues to be able to say god is my god christ my redeemer and the holy ghost my sanctifier thirdly because they could not discerne of things that did differ as between good and euill between euill and euill and between temporall things and eternall blessings this spirituall discerning is a gift of god grace in that christ saith they were blinde though they had knowledge wee may learne that al knowledge is but meere ignorace before god to those persons that know not themselus and god to be their god in christ for want hereof christ calleth the angell of this church blind thogh otherwise hee were a verie learned man which must teach vs not to rest content with any humane learning no not with the literall knowledge of the gospel but we must labor further to know our selues and to know god in christ amp christ our redeemer and be able in some good sort to discern between things that differ dauid a most worthy prophet intituleth the psalme his learning what learning sheweth he there answer surely nothing but the knowledge of the pardon of his sins and indeede that is it which seasoneth all our learning and therfore aboue all things we must labour for it the third part of their misery is nakednes nakednes is two fold to the eie of man amp to god nakednes to the eie of man is bodily amp that is also two fold either that which was before the fall in the body of our first parents whereby their body being vncouered appeared very glorious without shame or that which is after the fall wherby the bodie being naked amp bare appears full of shame which is so excessiue by reason of mans sin that if necessity would permit the whole body both face amp hands should all be couered nakednes before god is when any man lies before god a deformed sinner in this case moses sawe the israelites exod when they had made a golden calfe for thereby they depriued themselues of god image and were guilty of that most greeuous sin of idolatry this is a misery of all miseries amp the greatest nakednes that can be and this is the nakednes of this church in this place qu why doth christ call them naked ans to mooue them and in their persons all professors to haue care not to flye from god io and to hide their sins with adam but to bring themselues into his presence and there lay open their sinnes that they may obtain a couering for them by christ it is the practise of the world to hide their sins fro man but neuer to care how bare amp naked they be in the sight of god who yet seeth them all as plainly as we see the sores of any poore lazer that shews the same to moue our pity towards him which if we could see we shuld be ashamed not to seeke to couer our sins before god we must therfore labor in our owne consciences to see the nakednesse of our soules before god and seeke to be touched and humbled for the same that so we may earnestly intreate for the righteousnesse of christ to be a couering to cloath our soules this was dauids practise for when hee saith blessed are they whose sinnes are couered psalm he would giue vs to vnderstand that hee vsed to vncouer his sinnes and lay them open before god that at his handes in christ he might get a couer for them these are the particular partes of a mans miserie which euery man must labour to feele in himselfe if he would bee partaker of the righteousnesse of christ for thus hath christ both in generall and in particular set downe the miserie of this church that he might prepare them to receiue the blessed comfort which followeth in the next verse heere beginneth the counsell of christ vnto this church wherein first he propoundeth a notable remedie for her miserie before noted in this remedie wee are to consider three things the manner of prescribing it the remedie it selfe and the meanes whereby it is obtained for the first this remedie is propounded not in any sharpe commandement but by a milde and gentle aduise i counsell thee and herein christ doth take to himselfe the office of the counseller of his church for as god hath his church and people so he hath his counsellers by whom in mercie hee hath reuealed his counsell vnto his church the principale counseller is christ so he saith in the person of wisedom pro counsell is mine and isay saith to vs a childe is borne and he shall call his name wonderfull covnseller the mightie god the euerlasting father the prince of peace yes he is both king amp counseller to his church this office christ challengeth to himselfe for these causes first because he aduiseth his church touching the way whereby they must escape euerlasting death and come to eternall life secondly because he teacheth them how they may practise euery busines so as it may please god thirdly because hee teacheth them how they may in grieuous dangers and distresses find a good issue or else bee able with patience to beare them these things he worketh dayly in his church not by extraordinary means but ordinarily by his word and spirit and therefore may iustly challenge this honour to bee called the counseller of his church from this office of christ wee learne two things first to doe all the honour and reuerence we can vnto his maiestie for he is our professed counseller who imployes himselfe for the good of his church counsellers of the state and of the law are highly honoured and respected of all sorts euen for their counsell in worldly matters though often it fayle how much more ought wee to honour christ our heauenly counseller whose counsell leadeth vnto glorie and is stable and sure for euer looke how much his counsell excelleth theirs so much ought he to be honoured aboue them all secondly in all distresses and grieuous temptations and dangers either of soule or body wee must take counsell and aduise from christ iesus for to this end doth hee reueale himselfe to bee a counseller that man in distresse comming to him by his aduise might bee comforted and eased when moab ammon and mount seir banded themselues against iuda the people were in great distresse and danger but marke what good king iehosophat did he betooke himselfe to the lord his counseller saying lord we know not what to doe but our eyes are towards thee chronicle that is direct thou vs in this danger for of our selues we know not how to escape this pratise ought to bee followed of all man especially in time of any danger such as these dayes are by reason of sinne the counsell of wizards sorcerers and astrologians ought not to bee sought after but by prayer wee ought to humble our selues and call only and continually on this our onely true counseller ii point the remedie it selfe which hath relation to the former verse for there hee set downe the miserie of this church in three parts which were all great miseries and heere hee so propoundeth his remedie that it is answerable to their miserie in the seuerall parts thereof for first heere is gold to make them rich answerable to their pouertie secondly raiment to hide their nakednesse thirdly oyntment to take away their blindnesse for the first by gold according to the analogie of the scripture we are to vnderstand the graces of god spirit as true faith repentance the feare of god loue of god and the true loue of man pet faith is compared to gold in the tryall thereof and so may all other gifts of the spirit be hereby vnderstood secondly by gold wee are to vnderstand christs merits yes christ himselfe as the fountaine of all grace this gold is further said to be tryed by the fire that is most pure and precious gold purged from all drosse as fine as can be made by the article of man this is added to expresse the propertie of god graces and gifts namely that they are more precious vnto god then gold yes than gold tryed by the fire as peter saith by this euery person is taught how to beautifie themselues both in soule amp body it is the common blind opinion of the world that foreign attyre and rich iewels do adorne the body and indeede in some cases the body may bee adorned with pearles and iewels but the right way to adorne any person indeed is to furnish the soule with these graces of the spirit which vnto god be more precious than fine gold our bodyes and soules ought to be the dwelling places of the holy ghost amp therefore we must adorne them and make them fit for so worthy a guest which must be done by the good graces of the spirit and not by strange and foreign attyre which no good man could euer abide secondly these graces haue a further effect than to beautifie and that is to make rich heere then see the common folly yes the spirituall madnesse of man in the world who spend all their time wit and strength to furnish their houses with treasure amp to enrich their body and in the meane time leaue their soules vngarnished what a madnesse is this that man should neglect the true riches and follow after that which is nothing els but counterfeit copper seeing therefore god graces bee the true treasure which fadeth not let vs seeke after them as wisedome counselleth pro receiue mine instruction and not siluer and knowledge rather than fine gold for wisedome is better then precious stones the second part of this remedie is a white garment that is christ himselfe and his righteousnesse imputed so paul saith gal all that are baptized into christ haue put on christ there christ is made a garment whom euery one that beleeueth in him doth put on againe the fruites of the spirit are a garment amp therefore we are commanded to colloss put on tender mercie kindnesse humblenesse of minde meekenesse and long suffering further christ sheweth the end of this garment namely to couer the nakednesse of our soules lest the filthynesse thereof which we by our sins haue brought vpon vs doe appeare the third part of this remedie is anoynting with eye salue where by eye salue wee must vnderstand the spirit of illumination and knowledge wrought in the mind by the holy ghost whereby man know themselues and their estate for as eye salue sharpens the eyes and cleeres the sight where it was by some occasion dimned so doth christ by the illumination of the spirit make a man know god in christ and to discerne betweene good and euill and betweene things temporall and blessings eternall thus wee haue the meaning of the words whereby wee may see that by all these three wee can vnderstand nothing else but christ himselfe and his merits now one and the same thing in christ is signified by diverse tearmes to shew that there is in christ the fulnesse of all grace and plentifull redemption yes store of supplyes for all our wants the laodiceans were poore but christ was their riches they were naked christ was their garment and lastly they were blinde but christ was their eye salue so that what wants soeuer be in vs there is store of supply thereof in christ this must the more diligently be marked because the papists make christ but halfe a sauiour in putting our merits vnto his and so disgrace him in his glorious worke wherein he is a most absolute sauiour and redeemer iii point the means whereby these worthy gifts of god may bee gotten is by buying and bargaining so christ saith i counsell thee to buy of me where he alludeth to the outward state of this citie for it was rich and also giuen to much traffic as hystories record and therefore hee speakes to them in their owne kinde as if he should say you are a people exercised in much traffic and delighted with nothing more than buying and selling well i haue wares that will serue your turne as gold garments and oyle therefore come and buy of mee these wordes must not bee vnderstood properly for so wee can buy nothing of christ because there is nothing that is good in any but it proceedeth from the free gift of god in christ this is onely spoken by way of resemblance to buying and selling which stands in these points which are the principall things in bargaining first a man sees his want and desires to haue it supplyed and therfore goes to the place where such things are to be sold secondly he seeth the thing and he liketh it thirdly he prizeth and valueth it fourthly he maketh exchange for it by money or money worth fiftly if it be a great summe he giueth earnest so in the getting of christ there is a kind of resemblance to all these first a man must feele himselfe to stand in need of christ and his merits because man see want of bread meat and drinke in their houses therefore doe they goe to buy the same now looke how fencibly any man feeles these worldly wants so euidently should we feele our want of christ and his merits for this is the first beginning that causeth vs to seeke to receiue christ iesus secodly feeling our wats we shold hunger amp long after christ that we might bee made partakers of him amp the vertue of his merits as a man that is to buy a thing doth take a liking thereof which doth stir vp a desire in him to buy so must we labour to haue liking of christ which wil mooue vs to seeke vnto him isay hoe all they that thirst come and buy so that none make this bargaine but he that thirsteth thirdly we must prize and value christ aboue all things in this world euen at so high a rate that we account al things in regard of him to bee but lost yes euen drosse amp dunge p ul as paul did fourthly we must make exchange how we can giue christ nothing but his owne answer properly there is no exchange and therefore he saith isay hoe come and buy without money for nothing simon magu is heauily checked and accursed for offring to buy the gifts of the holy ghost acts and yet there is an exchange to be made we must giue him our sins and receiue his righteousnesse amp therefore he is said corinthian to be made sin for vs that wee should be made the righteousnes of god in him see a most blessed exchange for our sinne and shame we receiue his blessed grace and righteousnes quest how is this exchange made answer in the practise of faith and repentance for when we humble our selues and confesse our sinnes praying earnestly for remission and beleeue our reconciliation by christ then is hee our righteousnesse lastly though we can giue nothing vnto christ yet hee giu th vnto vs an earnest in this bargaine to wit some portion of god ephe corinthian spirit and some small measure of his graces as grace to bewayle our sinnes to humble our selues and to pray for the pardon of them with purpose not to sinne againe these be the earnests of this bargaine and thus is heauen bought and sold between christ and vs the receiuing of his true sauing graces be they neuer so small euen as a penie is a suffi ient earnest for a bargaine of a hundred pound here we see we are commanded to buy christ and to make a bargaine with him whereby we may haue right to him and his merits but how goes the case with the world surely many come where this bargaine is offered but few there be that buy wee are like to passengers on the sea who see many goodly buildings sumptuous cities amp fruitfull ilands but they make no purchase of them they only prayse them as they behold them and so passe by so wee come and heare the doctrine of christ and his merits and approoue of the same but where is the partie that maketh this bargaine come to particular points and it will appeare that few bargaine for christ for who feeles his own miserie as he ought who perceiues himselfe to stand in such neede of christ as he doth worldly wants wee feele and are affected with them but in regard of spirituall wants we are sencelesse and yet til we truely feele our miserie we neuer come to make this bargaine with christ againe come to our desire amp hungring after christ in bodily thirst and hunger wee can say i hunger or i thirst but who can say i hunger amp thirst after christ and his righteousnesse alas our hearts are full we feele no want nay they are dead we feare none euill and as for our valuing and esteeming of christ we are plaine gaderens and esawes wee preferre the world and the basest things therein before christ and for the exchange we are loth to part with our sins amp to put on christs righteousnes which plainly shewes wee make no exchange and though we bee willing to lay heapes of sins on christ yet who takes christes righteousnesse and declares the same by the fruites thereof and lastly for the earnest of the spirit though some there be that haue receiued it yet the body of our people as their consciences can tell them haue not receiued it for they want knowledge faith and other graces by all these it is more than manifest that this bargaine is not made and yet true it is that for worldly amp base barganes he must rise early that will goe beyond them but what a shame is this that we should be so expert in vile earthly things and haue no regard of this excellent and heauely bargaine wherfore seing christ calleth vs hereunto let vs make this one bargaine with him and that presently which wee shall testifie by doing the fiue former duties let vs neuer bee at rest till we may say each one for himselfe i haue bargained with christ and receiued his earnest yes our care should be that this bargaine be made not with vs alone but with our children many are forward to bring vp their childre in good trade wherein they may buy and sell for their liuing wherein they doe well but withall they ought to be as carefull to teach them to make this bargaine with christ and then they doe farre better for this is the cheapest and the chiefest marchandize that euer was sett to sale which we may buy without monie and yet it will make vs rich for euer many labour in tafficke and take great paines and yet often loose thereby but make this bargaine once and then thou shalt neuer loose it nor any thing thereby but continue for euer rich in god because our sauiour christ had so sharply rebuked this church they might thereby take occasion to distrust and despaire of his fauour and mercie heere therefore it pleaseth him to take away all occasion of doubting after this sort if i vse to rebuke amp chasten all those whom i loue then you are not to despaire of my mercie by reason of my sharpe reproofe whereby i haue threatned to spew you out of my mouth for your sinne of luke warmnesse but thus i vse to deale with all those whom i loue and therefore in this regard you need not to doubt of my loue and fauour the meaning as many as i loue christ loues the creatures two wayes as hee is creator and as he is redeemer as he is the creator hee loueth all his creatures with a common amp generall loue whether they be liuing or dead reasonable or vnreasonable as he is redeemer he loues his creatures with a speciall and a peculiar loue which is not common to all but proper to that part of man kinde which is chosen to saluation before the world was and of this peculiar loue hee speaketh here i rebuke the word in the originall which is translated rebuke is more significant than can fitly bee expressed in any one english worde thus much is meant thereby as if christ had said first i will conuince them of their sins and after reprooue admonish and check them for the same and chasten this must bee vnderstood of a kinde of correction which a father vseth on his child called nurturing which is correction to breake the childe of his fault and bad manners and to teach him his dutie this then is the meaning all those whom i beare speciall fauour vnto doe i conuince of their particular faults and then checke and reprooue them and nurture them as a father doth his child to make them leaue their particular vices and to walke in obediece and to assure vs that this is the true meaning read pro whence the words are taken amp heb where they are more fully explained heere then christ sets downe his ordinary dealing with them whom he taketh and chooseth to bee his disciples and members namely hee conuinceth them of their faults he reproueth and chasteneth them for this very end to breake them of their sins and to bring them to reformation and this dealing of christ belongeth to euery servant and member of christ without exception yes christ layeth rebukes and chastisments on all his children amp that in diverse measure according to the nature of their sinnes and the disposition of the parties such as are hardly broken of their sins hee layeth on them more heauie iudgementes and chastisments that they may bee brought humiliation and so true and therefore euery one that would bee a discipl and member of christ must looke to goe vnder his correction and his sharpe and seuere rebuke according as they are in heart disposed vnto sinnes either more or lesse hee must passe vnder the rodde that would come into the bond of the couenant ezech the vse of this doctrine is two fold set downe prov the first thus my despise no the correction of the lord for the lord correcteth whom hee loueth his chastycements are tokens of his loue that is whensoeuer the lord either in the ministerie of his word reproueth thy sins or by any affliction chasteneth thee despise it not neither set light by it but make good vse thereof vnto thine owne soule the second vse is faint not when thou article corrected that is let not the greatnesse of it daunt thee but arme thy selfe with patience because he vseth to correct all those whom hee loueth making his chastisments tokens of his loue secondly christ heere setteth before all gouernours an example to followe especially to fathers and masters his example is this on euery child that hee loueth hee layeth corrections for this nd to breake them of their sinnes answerably gouernours must shew tokens of loue towards those that are vnder them by due reproofe and correction that o they may be broken of their misdemeanor and brought vnto obedience to god it were to bee wished that both parents and masters would followe christ in this example and so seeke the reformation of those that are vnder them but more lamentable is the parents and masters doe thinke it sufficient for them if they prouide for their children and seruante food and rayment and necessaries for the bodie and so altogether neglect the good of their soules which is the cause of many sinnes and so of many iudgements both which ought to mooue them to put in practise this dutie thirdly the very order of christs worde doth minister vnto vs a necessary instruction ching his manner of correcting his servant for first hee propounds a direct end of all his corrections vpon them to wit their nurturing and reformation then that hee may attaine thereto hee proceedeth thus first hee doth conuince their conscience of their sinnes then by reproofes he rebukes and checks them and lastly correcteth them by laying chastisments on them a most excellent and blessed order in vsing correction for the good of the partie chastised which ought to bee followed of all gouernours parents and masters especially first they must propound a good end of their correction euen the amendement and saluation of the partie and that they may then proceed they must first conuince their conscience of the then reprooue checke and admonish them and if that take not place they must proceed vnto meete and conuenient bodily correction all which must bee done not for reuenge but to bring the to amendement and to make them obedient to the will of god whereby wee see how farre many parents and gouernours ouer shoote themselues when as they make their corrections matters of reuenge and choller wherein they s eldome intend the reformation of the offender which is a fault flat against the word of god and therefore to be considered of euery good christian be zealous therefore and repent in the former verse hee propounded a remedie against their spirituall pride in wordes hee doth directly propound a remedie against their luke warmnesse but first obserue the coherence of these words with the former christ hath said whom i loue i rebuke and correct according as their fault is therefore sayth hee to this church because i haue rebuked and corrected thee by seuere threatnings for thy luke warmnesse therefore now become zealous and amend here see the proper nd of all reprofes and corrections namely the reformation and amendement of mens faults amp misdemeanors whatsoeuer that so they may bee more carefull of their wayes and more zealous in good duties then euer they were whensoeuer therefore wee are reprooued by the word of god or when the lord shall visite vs in body minde or goods by any kind of crosse wee must remember to take occasion thereby to repent and amend knowing that by all these as by so many sermons the lorde calles vs to amendement nowe come to the remedie of their luke warmnesse be zealous that wee may vnderstand this commandement we are to handle some points touching zeale first what is zeale zeale is a burning affection in regard of christian religion and the true worship of god this zeale is compounded of two affections of loue and anger or indignation so that in this commandement are two duties enioyned vnto this church first that they should loue christ and his religion aboue all things secondly that they should be greiued especially for this that christ was dishonoured his worship prophaned and his doctrine not embraced but insteed thereof false worship and false doctrine entertayned when both these concurre then zeale is in the heart a most notable example hereof wee haue in christ psalm where the prophet dauid in his person saith the zeale of god house had eaten him vp whereby thus much is signified that the heat of his loue for the maintaining of his fathers glorie had euen consumed him and that his indignation was so great because his fathers name was dishonoured and his worship prophaned that it did euen care him vp this wee shall see to bee true in christ if wee read the hystorie of his life john yes hee professeth of himselfe that it was meate and drinke vnto him to doe his fathers will ioh that thing he preferred before his owne life or safetie nay for the accomplishment thereof hee was content to suffer the pangs of hell the like zeale was in elijah when all israel was fallen to idolatry his heart was zealous for the lord of hosts king ii point the kinds of zeale zeale is either good or bad in good zeale are these things required i true faith as the roote thereof tim verse the end of the commandement is loue of a pure heart and of a good conscience and of faith vnfained now one apart of zeale is loue and therefore proceed from true faith so must true zeale and that which is not grounded on faith is rather rashnesse and fiercenesse of nature than true zeale ii repentance corinthian there are seuen of repentance recyted whereof zeale is one that is good zeale euen a burning loue of true religion and a godly indignation when false religion is embraced there may bee zeale in a man that hath no repentance as was in iehu king come with mee sayth hee and see the zeale that i haue for the lord yet he wanted repentance for verse it is said iehu regarded not to walke in the law of the lord god of israel with all his heart for hee departed not from the sinnes of ieroboam which made israel to sinne and therefore he had not in him the true zeale that is heere commanded iii zeale must come from knowledge for without knowledge it is but rashnesse and bold hardinesse such as the iewes had rom whose zeale was without knowledge and such as paul had before his conuersion philipp verse in zeale hee persecuted god church knowledge therefore in god word must bee the guide and conductor of our zeale iii point the fruites of zeale must be considered for the better discerning of true zeale first true zeale constraineth a man in euery thing to seeke to please god whether we be out of wits we are it vnto god or whether we bee in our right mind we are it vnto you for the loue of christ constrayneth vs so wheresoeuer this true zeale is in any measure it offereth violence to the heart so as a man cannot but endeuour to doe his dutie for the loue he beareth vnto christ elihu sayd the grace of god was in his heart as new wine in a vessell which must needs vent out iob secondly true zeale makes a man indeuour to serue and please god with all his heart power and strength so good king iosiah hearing the words of the law read hee turned not slackely or negligently but with all his heart and all his soule and with all his might according to all the law of moses so as like him was no king before neither after him arose there any like him psalm dauid humbling himselfe for his sinnes prayes for the pardon of them with such maruellous zeale as no tongue can vtter desiring god to remember him according to the multitude of his mercies often repeating the same thing in diverse tearmes that in some sort hee might expresse the earnest desire of his heart and in giuing god thankes for his benefits he putteth all the strength of his heart thereto crying out my soule prayse thou the lord and all that is within mee psalm and thus we see what a thing it is to be zealous whence true zeale ariseth and what it worketh in mans heart seeing wee as hath beene shewed are tainted with this sinne of lukewarmnesse and coldnesse in religion let vs here learne how to redresse this vice wee must become zealous hauing in our heart a feruent loue of true religion and a vehement indignation when the same is disgraced and false worship takes place let religion therefore take place in our hearts and let vs bee feruent and shew that same in our liues by zealous obedience away with all slacknesse and lukewarmnesse it were better to bee iewes and turkes and to hold no religion then to be luke warme in the true profession and thus much for zeale the second part of this remedie is to repent or amend this they are also enioyned because zeale without repentace is nothing but rashnes iehues zeale was no true zeale because hee wanted repentance euen then when hee was zealous but wherefore was this church inioyned to repent namely for lukewarmnes not for that she had committed any horrible sinne but because she was slacke in good duties here then we haue a good lesson for the ignorant sort that challenge god mercie vnto themselues because they are no notorious malefactors as murtherers amp adulterers they hate no man but do good vnto all but heere they are taught to reforme this their blindnesse and ignorance for repentance must be for want of good duties yes for slacknesse therein therefore let no man sooth himselfe in his ignorance with a false perswasion that all is wel if he liue not in grosse sinnes this is the enchantment of the deuill whereby he rocks many asleepe in their sinnes till hee carry their soules to hell a good meaning will not serue the turne god requires true zeale in well doing heere christ to keepe his church from despaire ministers vnto them the signes and tokens of his loue and fauour and before the same sets downe this note of attention beholde hereby intending to make them more attentiuely to marke the tokens of his loue that plainly seeing the same they might not doubt thereof heereby in generall wee are taught that if wee would arme our selues against desperation and distrust in any distresse wee must both often and seriously consider and marke the tokens of god loue vnto vs and that will fortifie our faith read psalm in euery verse saue the last hee sets downe tokens of god loue and fauour towards him and then in the last concludeth thus without doubt kindesse amp mercie shall follow mee all the dayes of my life and i shall remaine a long season in the house of the lord our hearts are naturally filled with doubting which will bewray it selfe in any distresse but to preuent and cut off all hurt that may come therby let vs marke the good dealing of our god towards vs and obserue the tokens of his loue and mercie in his ordinarie prouidence and these will notably strengthen vs against distrust and surely no person is so full of despaire but if hee could looke backe into the mercies of god from the beginning of his dayes and lay them to his heart they would minister comfort vnto him in regard of his loue and fauour at that instant more particularly christ ministring comfort vnto this church doth expresse his meaning by a borrowed speach comparing euery man vnto an house his heart vnto a doore whereby entrance is made and himselfe vnto a guest or stranger desiring to come and enter in not so much to find courtesie as to shew fauour and kindnesse in the words of this verse there bee two signes of his loue set downe first a heartie desire of their conuersion which hee earnestly seeketh secondly a promise of mutuall fellowship after their conuersion the first in these wordes behold i stand at the doore and knock in this desire christ expresseth two things first that this church if wee regard the greatest part thereof had no true fellowship with christ nor christ with them for hee stands at the doore of their hearts which were closed vp against him this may seeme strange but the case is euident for though they had in them many good things as knowledge of god will and did professe the gospel and were partakers of the signes and seales of the couenant of grace yet they were tainted with this notorious sinne of luke warmnesse which closed vp the doore of their heart against christ and barred him out here then we are carefully to obserue that a man may haue in him many good things and yet by liuing in one sin we be quite cut off from all true fellowship with christ iudas had many excellent gifts he forsooke all and folowed christ he preached the gospel and administred the sacraments and yet by couetousnes the doore of his heart was quite barred against christ so herode reuerenced john and heard him gladly and did many things at his instruction mark yet by the sinne of incest his heart was so closed that he had no fellowship with christ and so it is with vs it is good that wee know the will of god and approue the same and professe the gospel and also receiue the seales of the couenant but yet for all these our case may be such as wee shall haue no true fellowshippe with christ for if wee nourish though but one sinne and liue therein that will make a separation betweene christ and vs bee the sinne what it will as couetousnesse adulterie prophanenesse or such like heereby then all that desire to haue true fellowshippe with christ are to be warned to purge their liues from all sinne so as their hearts bee not taynted with nourishing any one sinne for euen one sinne w soeuer it bee is a strong barre will keepe christ from comming into vs secondly whereas hee saith i haue stood at the doore for so the wordes are heere hee speaketh to this church as hee vsed to speake by his old prophets as by ieremie ier amp i haue sent vnto you all my prophets rysing early euery day and sending them and by esay i haue spread out my handes all the day vnto a rebellious people which walked in a way that was not good euen after their owne imaginations so heere i haue stood at the doore that is long euen till night as the word supping importeth hereby christ would signifie his great pacience in waiting for the conuersion of this people of loadicea in iustice hee might long agone haue cast them to the pit of destruction for their sinnes and yet in mercie he waiteth for their conuersion and complaines that he hath waited long here then we haue iust occasion to take a view of god patience in wayting for the conuersion of a sinner and that which hee saith to this church hee may as iustly say vnto vs for hee hath stood very long at our doores euen yeares and vpward and yet still continueth knocking so as he may iustly complaine of his long waiting let vs then here learne to know the day of our visitation which is then to any people when christ stands at their doores and knockes and vnto vs this day is present wee haue the ministerie of the gospell and therefore we must be perswaded that this is the time of our visitation and hereupon learne the dutie which christ teacheth the iewes namely acknowledg the day of our visitation which if we doe not wee must looke for like vengeance which fell vpon the iewes because they regarded not when god sent his owne son from his bosome to knocke at the dore of their hearts and knocke heere is a further signification of his desire of their conuersion wherein we may behold his great amp vnspeakable mercie towards this church and in them towards all other his children this church had bard out christ by their sinnes and yet he pursues them he knockes hee vseth meanes to enter for good and vouchsafes them mercy then when they refuse it thus when adam had sinned and fled and hid himselfe did the lord seek him in the garden amp make with him the couenant of grace and therefore it is truely sayd in isay isay the lord is found of them that neuer sought him luke christ fetcheth the lost sheepe that was gone astray all which shew and set out vnto vs the vnspeakable greatnesse of god mercie in christ vnto miserable man who then shewes mercie vnto him when he neuer seeketh it this his mercie is verified in all churches and vnto vs vvhich must be an occasion to enlarge and stirre vp our hearts to blesse the name of christ for this vnspeakable mercie in vouchsafing vs fauor when we neuer sought it but refused it quest how doth christ knocke answer the words going before wherto these haue reference giue light vnto this question before christ had threatned this church euen to spew her out of his mouth for her luke warmenesse and after hee counsels her to buy of him gold and other remedies now vpon this greeuous threatnings the church might despaire of his mercie but christ to comfort her tels her here that these reproofes and rebukes were but knockings at the dores of their hearts to make them open for then christ knocketh at the hearts of any people when he vouchsafed them means to see their sinnes and threatens them for the same and withall giues them coun wherby they may escape the fearefull punishments thereby deserued here then note the state of any people that haue the ministrie of the gospell vouchsafed vnto them they haue christ among them standing at the dore of their harts and knocking to come in by exhortations admonitions threatnings and by promises which is a great and endlesse mercie first seeing wee haue christ knocking at our dores there ought not to bee in vs such dulnesse and deadnesse of heart in hearing him knocke if a man of any account come and knocke at the dore of our house oh what a stirre will we make to let him in quickely vvhat a shame then is it that we should be dead harted when christ iesus the king of heauen knockes at the dore of our hearts secondly this must admonish vs with all speed to turne vnto god by true repentance for wee knowe not how long hee will continue knocking and if wee doe not heare and turne before he withdraw himselfe from vs wee perish eternally for if we refuse when he knocketh at the dore of our harts he will refuse when we knocke at the dore of his mercie prou mat note further this knocking is not ordinarie but it is ioyned with crying for he saith if he heare my voice so that hee both knocks amp cries it is then the knocking of one that would enter we therfore ought answerably with serious regard to receiue the threatnings of the law and the promises of grace and so bee as earnest in receiuing and embracing him as hee is in knocking to come into vs the second token of christs loue is a gracious promise of fellowship with them in these words if any man heare my voice and open the dore i will come in vnto him and will suppe with him and hee with mee these wordes haue beene much abused and therefore i will stand to set downe the true vse and meaning of the same marke the forme of speech is such as giues vnto a mans will amp soule an action in his conuersion whereby hee comes to christ and receiues christ this may seeme strange but it is for iust cause vsed by the holy ghost for in the conuersion of a sinner there be three workers the holy ghost the word and mans will the holy ghost is the principall agent inlightning the minde with true knowledge softning the heart and changing the will from euill to good the worde is the instrument of the holy ghost for now he worketh not by reuelation or speciall instinct but ordinarily in and by the word when a man is reading hearing or meditating either publickely or priuately for the word preached is the power of god to mans saluation from faith to faith thirdly mans will though by nature it be euill and dead vnto grace yet being renewed by the holy ghost in the first act of conuersion moueth and striueth to bee turned it is not like a peece of waxe onely passiue which without any action receiueth impression but as fire so soone as it fire doth borne and so soone as it burneth it is fire so the will though by nature it mooue not yet being renewed by grace it mooueth and so some as it mooueth it is renewed and hereupon it is that the holy ghost ascribeth action vnto a sinner that is to bee conuerted which argueth not that by themselues man can haue a will to bee conuerted but that being renewed they may will their conuersion and for this cause is the gospell preached in these tearmes repent and beleeue not to shew that man by nature can repent or beleue but that god in mans conuersion doth giue him grace to will and desire the same hence then it followes thar this text hath been diverse waies abused first by the papists who hence would gather free will of conuersion in a sinner by nature true it is a man hath free will in his conuersion yet not by nature but by grace neither can any more be gathered hence for here it is onely said if any man heare and open when i knocke nay hence wee may rather gather that a man by nature cannot heare nor open because the counsell is giuen to such as are poore and blinde and naked by nature secondly they also abuse this text that hereby would prooue a flexible free will by grace to be in man which is this sundry man thinke that after the fall of adam all being wrapt vp in sinne god gaue a generall grace whereby any man might will and receiue that which is good and this grace though it dispose the will in some part to that which is good yet it takes not the corruption away but that remaines still whereupon if hee will he may receiue christ by that general grace or if hee will not hee may refuse christ by his naturall corruption which yet remaineth in him it is saide this may bee gathered from this text but the truth is here is no foundation for flexible free will all that can here be gathered is that man hath free will in his conuersion yet not by a generall but by god speciall grace nay christs ministry serue for this end that those which before could not turne of themselues might by grace be conuerted this flexible grace is against god word christ sayth ioh euery one that hath heard and hath learned of the father commeth vnto me he saith not may come if hee will but peremptorily commeth for mans will cannot dispose and ouer the worke of god but the worke god ouer rules the will of man though man be vnwilling yet when god calleth effectually hee cannot but come for the creature cannot reiect or resist the will and calling of his creator if any man open vnto me i will come ampc the proper intent of christ in this conditional promise is to prouoke them that be dull and heauy to listen diligently to christ words and to receiue the doctrine of saluation from him gladly in the example of this church we are taught our dutie seeing christ in the ministrie of his word knockes both by threatnings by promises and good counsell therefore we must all of vs listen vnto the words of christ amp open the dores of our hearts and receiue him into the same but alas the practise of the world is far otherwise man are churlish nabals vnto christ who though he come friendly yet they repell him making no account of such against nay we are bethlemites which haue no roome for christ in the innes of our harts if christ will needs lodge with vs hee must lye among the beast in the filthy stable nay many send him out of their gates with the jew and crucifie him with their sinnes but let vs abandon this greeuous sinne for it is the right way to plunge our soules into the pit of destruction quest how must a man open his hart to receiue christ answer by doing two things first hee must labour to see his owne vilenesse that hee is vnworthy to receiue so blessed a guest then hee must humble himselfe and acknowledge this his vnworthinesse euen as the ruler did when he sayd vnto christ lord i am not worthy that thou shouldest come vnder my roofe mat this humiliation is the beginning of grace this done hee must by true faith lay hold on christ that is beleeue that christs death and passion is for the pardon of his sinnes and for the saluation of his soule for as christ dwels in mens hearts by faith so by faith he must be receiued into their harts here some will say if this be to receiue christ then all is well but take heede thou deceiue not thy selfe with a vaine imagination of thine owne braine in stead of faith looke therefore that thy faith be true amp sound if it be true faith it will work by loue euen a true loue of christ and his members which will appeare by keeping his commaundements ioh i will come in vnto him and suppe with him and he with me here is the thing promised to wit mutuall communion and fellowship with christ this is the principall token of christs loue being indeed the verie ground of all true happinesse ioy and comfort and therefore it is added to mooue them to open vnto christ this societie is here propounded in two parts first the sinner being conuerted makes a feast vnto christ i will come in vnto him and suppe with him secondly christ makes a feast vnto him and hee shall sup with me and in these two consists the sum of salomons song of songs where christ entertaineth the church and the church againe feasts christ for the first some may aske how can a poore sinner make a feast for christ answer cantic the church or euerie christians soule calleth christ vnto a feast in his garden to eate his pleasant thinges this feast consisteth of these things first of the fruits of true repentance psalm a broken and contrite heart is a daintie di acceptable vnto god secondly of an hart beleeuing the word and promises to god for without faith it is impossible to please god heb thirdly the penitent sinner must rom giue vp himselfe in soule and bodie a holy and acceptable sacrifice vnto god by seruing god faithfully not only in the duties of piety but also in the faithfull perfourmance of the duties of his particular calling these be the delightfull dishes wherwith christ is fed the second feast is made by christ and hee shall sup with me christ comes not to bee entertained onely but to entertaine and the feast which he makes is his own bodie and blood ioh for his flesh is meat indeede and his blood is drinke indeede the vessels whereon these meates are caried are the word and sacraments and all that bee his welcome guests are true penitent sinners which haue hungring and thirsting hearts after his bodie and blood luke and from this feast arise these blessings rom righteousnesse peace of conscience and ioy in the holy ghost seeing this fellowship with christ is here promised to those that open amp receiue him into their hearts first hereby we are taught to renounce all earthly and carnall pleasures and not to addict our selues to drink and quaffing or sumptuous fare for heere is a better feast sette before vs whereupon we must set our hearts turning our eyes from all worldly pleasures we know by experience how friends entertaine each other but wee must labor to know how to entertaine christ and to feast him with his owne graces that hee may suppe with vs and we with him and so haue true fellowship with him againe by this we may see a notable abuse of many that come to the lordes table for heere wee see is required an interchange of feasting betweene christ and a christian but many there bee that will come to the lord table and feast with christ that will neuer feast christ againe and yet we ougt to be as carefull to feast him as to feast with him it is a shame to suppe often with christ and yet like vngrateful nabals neuer to haue one good dish of grace and holy obedience to set before him wherewith indeede we should feast him dayly others will seem to giue him good entertainment for that day whereon they feast with christ but soone after they giue him gall to eate and vineger to drinke by their dayly sinnes verse to him that ouercommeth will i make to sit with me in my throne euen as i ouercame and sit with my father in his throne verse let him that hath an eare heare what the spirit sayth vnto the churches here is the conclusion of this epistle and it hath two parts a promise verse and a commaundement verse in the promise note two things first to whome it is made to him that ouercommeth hereof we haue spoken secondly the thing promised that is fellowship with christ in glorie i will make to sit ampc whereby is not meant equalitie of glorie and honor for that is not possible for any creature to receiue but a participation onely of some part of his glorie so much as shall suffice for his perfect happinesse and because it might bee thought no great matter therefore it is illustrated by a comparison as i ouercame and sit with my father in his throne as if hee should say i will aduance them that ouercome their spirituall enemy into the participation of my glorie euen as my father when i had ouercome aduanced me into the fellowship of his glorie now christ as hee is mediator is inferiour to his father and in that regard is not aduanced to equall glorie with his father though he sit with him so the members of christ being inferiour vnto him may sitte with him in his throne though their glorie be vnequall these things for substance haue beene handled chap verse the second part of this conclusion let him that hath an eare heare ampc hath also been handled before

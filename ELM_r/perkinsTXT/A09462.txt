in the eleuen first verses of this chapter are recorded and set downe vnto vs the seuerall temptations of our sauiour christ and in them we are to consider three especiall points first the preparation vnto the combat verse and secondly the combat it selfe in three seuerall temptations verse thirdly the issue and effect of this combat verse the preparation hath two parts first the going forth of christ into the wildernesse in the first verse secondly his abode and conuersation in the wildernesse in the second verse the going forth of christ into the wildernesse is set out by sundrie circumstances first the time then secondly the mouing cause whereby he was caried thither namely he was led of the spirit thirdly the place the wildernesse fourthly the end to be tempted of the diuell then was iesus led in the chapter going before is set downe the baptisme of our sauiour christ as also the great honour of his baptisme and it pleased him to be baptized to shew that he was now installed into the office of a mediator and for the greater solemnitie of his baptisme he was proclaimed by the voice of god the father from heauen to be the chiefe doctor and the true prophet of the church of god for chap it is said there came a voice from heauen saying this is my welbeloued son in whom i am well pleased and also it is said that the spirit of god in the likenesse of a doue descended and light vpon him now so soone as christ was installed into his office of mediator and thus solemnely baptized and proclaimed euen from heauen to be the sole doctor and prophet of the church of god presently without delay as is marke he was led aside to be tempted of the diuell in that christ is no sooner baptised but he is presently tempted it sheweth vs that all those which haue bene baptised and giuen vp their names to christ must make account to be tempted and looke for temptations for if satan durst be so bold to set vpon iesus christ the head who was not onely man but very god how much more will he be bold to set vpon vs who be but weake and sinfull man and therefore so soone as we haue truly giuen vp our names to god and become the faithfull souldiers of christ and refuse to serue sinne and satan then will the diuell incounter vs and set vpon vs and we must looke for to be tempted preparing our selues to this spirituall battell and put vpon vs the whole complete armour of god ephesian but most man will say this doctrine is not true for they neuer felt any such combat in themselues though they haue bin baptized many yeares i answer such man whatsoeuer they be they haue onely the outward baptisme of water and neuer receiued the inward baptisme of the spirit and such man do indeed weare christs liuerie but do seruice to the diuell his enemie and therefore let such persons reforme them selues turne from their wicked and sinfull liues and seeke to serue the lord and then they shall find this doctrine most true for the children of israel so long as they liued vnder pharaoh in egypt they were not persecuted by pharaoh but when they did set their faces towards the land of canaan then presently he pursued them with all his malice and might so all the while man liue in egypt that is in sin and wickednesse and serue the diuell he will let them be at quiet but if euer we once set our hearts on that heauenly canaan and giue our selues to the seruice of god then he will with open mouth pursue vs follow vs with many armies and cast an hundred temptations in our way and as a poore bird which cometh to the shop and when she thinketh to get away then cometh all her paine and the net is spread ouer her so when man begin to leaue their euill courses and to set themselues to serue the lord presently the diuell doth spread his net to intangle them this must teach vs to watch and pray that we enter not into temptation secondly in that our sauiour is no sooner baptized amp ordained to be the great doctor of the church but he is presently tempted and encountred by satan hence we learne that all those which be appointed of god to any speciall office in the church or common weale they must make account they shall be tempted and looke for satans temptations one way or other it was that which befell the head and therefore let vs all that be his members reckon of it example of this we haue in moses who so soone as he was new called to be the guide and deliuerer of the children of israel he was faine to flie when he had killed the egyptian and dauid was no sooner appointed by god to be king of israell but saule did persecute him as soone as our sauiour christ had called the apostles to that office he brought them to the sea and there by his diuine power raised a storme so as they cried out maister saue vs or else we perish and this the lord doth in great wisdome for by this meanes he sheweth a man that he is not able of himselfe to execute the duties of his particular calling without the speciall grace of god and by these temptations and trials the lord stirreth vp a greater loue of his maiestie in the hearts of his children and with it many other graces as prayer patience ampc and maketh these graces the better to shew themselues seeing that our sauiour christ begins his propheticall office of teaching the church of god with temptations this should admonish the ministers of the word of god that they of all other man are subiect to satans temptations because they be the lord standard bearers and his lieutenants against whom satan and al his souldiers bend all their forces as souldiers often do against the standard bearer when as iehoshua the high priest stood before the lord satan stood at his right hand to hinder him zach he was a lying spirit in the mouth of foure hundred false prophets and this old red dragon reu with his taile draweth downe the third part of the stars of heauen he desired to winnow peter and to trie him by temptations luke and as the king of aram said of acab fight not against small or great but against the king of israel so satan fighteth not against any so much as the prophets of israel the ministers of the church so then we may see that temptations are necessary for the ministers of the word that they may both know what they be and also learne how to comfort others in time o temptation also to teach vs the true vse of the word of god and the force of it in resisting temptation for certaine it is that temptations teach man many things which they could neuer learne by bare studie so that one sayd well reading meditation prayer and temptations these foure make a diuine the second point to be considered is what was the cause which moued our sauior christ to go into the wildernesse which was the leading of the spirit iesus was led aside of the spirit luke or as the word signifieth he was caried apart mark not by a forced but a voluntary motion this was not a locall transportation of the bodie of christ as that of eliah and of philip from the eunuch but by the inward instinct of the holy ghost he was mooued and made willing to go as the word which luke vseth sheweth plainely and by the spirit here is not meant the diuell or an euill spirit but the holy spirit of god euen the third person in the trinitie and so we see that christ may both guide the spirit and be guided by the spirit for christ as he is man is led and guided by the spirit but as he is god he doth guide and send his spirit obiection christ sendeth the holy ghost therefore cannot be led by it ans as christ was man he was guided by god spirit as he was god he sent the spirit hence we may behold the exceeding holinesse of the manhood or humane nature of christ who as he was man was guided by the spirit of god euen in his mouing from one place to another and it is that which euery one should desire to be like vnto our sauiour christ in this viz to suffer our selues to be guided amp directed by god holy spirit in all our thoughts words and deeds for this is a true note of god children rom but as many as are not led by the spirit of god the same are none of his rom and therefore let vs all become plyable to the motions and directions of god blessed spirit so as we can say as dauid saith when thou saydst seeke ye my face my heart answered vnto thee o lord i will seeke thy face againe from this that christ was led vnto temptations by the spirit of god we learne that temptations come not by chance nor yet by the diuels will and appointment for he could not touch iob or any thing he had till he had leaue giuen him by the lord and he could not so much as enter into swine till christ gaue him leaue but they come by his ust permission and the speciall prouidence nd appointment of god for as god de reed that he which had ouercome all mankind should be ouercome by christ so he ath appointed this combat by temptations o all man the place where it is tried is the world as a theater the persons as souldiers tried are christians the person tempting is satan our aduersarie the beholders are man and angels the iudge or vmpire is the lord himselfe so that the issue shall be good and therefore when we be tempted we must not thinke it strange but rather as iam accompt it exceeding ioy when we are tempted for the triall of our faith and obedience and also seeing they come by god appointment it should moue vs all to endure them patiently seeing they cannot be auoyded seeing christ was led to be tempted hence we learne that no man must wittingly of his own head cast himself into places of danger for christ went not into the place of temptation til he was led by the spirit of god and so indeed if a man find himselfe moued by some extraordinary motion and instinct of the spirit he may offer himselfe vnto danger so paul went bound in the spirit to ierusalem that is he did willingly follow the motion god spirit which inforced him to go to ie rusalem and so many of the martyrs thoug they might haue fled yet being moued the inward motion of the holy ghost di stand to the truth abide the danger and en dured the fire but otherwise no man is wittingly to cast himselfe into danger yet if the lord send any danger vnto a man in the performance of his calling and vocation walking according to god word he is patiently to endure it and may not seeke to auoide the same here may be demaunded whether a ma may with good conscience and safely abid in such places where it is certainely known that euill spirits do haunt and vse to be although some be so venturous and bold that they feare nothing yet it is no wisdome neither is it lawful for man to frequent and abide in those places but rather to shunn them seeing the lord hath deliuered them vp into the power of the diuell and therefore such man as frequent such places know to be possessed do wilfully tempt god and cast themselues into needlesse danger vnlesse they haue extraordinary warrant from god this may serue to reprooue those man who say they care not into what company they come for they perswade themselues that no company can hurt them but let such man beware for how can it be but they shall be infected with the sinnes of those whose company they vsually do haunt and vse he that walketh with the wise shall be wise but a companion of fooles shall be like vnto them he that toucheth pitch shall be defiled and if sinners intice thee yeeld not vnto them againe here we see that so long as christ liued a priuate life at home with his father in his trade all this while the diuell lets him alone neither hath he these gifts of the holy ghost but after he was once installed to the office of a mediator presently the diuell sets vpon him and when he must now be another kind of man in teaching the people of god he is led now by the spirit of god and furnished for this high and excellent calling hence then we must learne that when we are appointed of god to any speciall office either in church or common weale we must then become new man fit for those places and carie our selues sutable to our callings thus when saul was annointed to b king he became another man thus whe dauid became of a shepheard a king he be haued himselfe as a king thus the apostle at the first were poore ignorant fisher man but being called to be apostles they le their old trade and became new man eue messengers of christ to preach the gospel to all nation this confuteth those which pleade extraordinary callings as those man who ca themselues elijah john baptist ampc for if thes were such man and had such extraordinari callings they should be endued with extraordinarie gifts fit for their calling but they are not nay we see they be but ordinary man againe by nature we be all borne the children of wrath and enemy to god but by grace are called to be christians now the it behoueth vs all to become new man to leade new liues fitting and sutable to our holy calling giuing our selues wholy to the seruice and worship of god now if any aske how christ was furnished with these gifts answer out of s luke that he was filled with the holy ghost chap verse if any furthe obiect that if he were so filled after his baptisme then he was not filled before i answer againe that as in his infancie he had a mea ure of gifts fit for that age so from time to me he increased in grace and after his bap sme had a greater appearance and measure f gifts then before his calling to preach it followeth into the wildernesse here is he third circumstance namely the place into he wildernesse or desert place which place christ did of purpose choose to be tempted n there be diverse opinions concerning this place some thinke it to be a litle wildernesse between ierusalem and iericho others iudge t to be the desert of arabia where elijah fa ted fortie dayes and fortie nights and where he children of israel wandred fortie yeares but seeing the holy ghost doth not shew what wildernes it was we are not curiously o inquire after it but onely know it was a desert and solitary place let vs rather seeke the reasons wherefore he was tempted in the wildernesse first because christ comming into the world to be ut mediator tooke vpon him the base estate of a servant and came in humiliation therefore when he was now baptized he would not go to ierusalem to publish his honour but he went into the desert a solitary wildernesse againe he went into the wildernesse tha he might not onely the more easily incounter but more victoriously ouercome his enemie the diuell for if satan had seene him i his glorie he durst not so fiercely and so eagerly haue set vpon him and therefore dot as the fisherman who hideth the hooke and sheweth onely the baite so christ he sheweth his manhood but couereth as it wer with a mantle his godhead so that the diu seeing him in the base estate of humiliation might be the more fierce in his temptation and he might get a more glorious victorie another reason why christ was tempte in the wildernes was this that he might giu the diuell the aduantage of the place and ouercomming might giue him the greate foyle for in the wildernesse we want the societie and fellowship of man to comfort v and such places be noted as solitarie an voide of comfort and such satan will choo especially for when a man is alone and solitarie it is that which is fittest for the diuel purpose for when the woman was alon how soone had the diuell ouercome her and therfore our sauior christ in going in the wildernes graunts the diuel that he desired to haue him alone by himselfe fourthly christ would be tempted in the wildernesse where was none to help him nor to assist him because the whole praise of the victory belonged to himselfe alone lastly christ went into the wildernesse that so after he might returne againe with greater authoritie and reuerence to preach the gospell for we know that when one hath liued with vs and departs for a season and after returnes againe we do receiue him with greater reuerence and make more account of him from this practise of christ his going into the wildernesse the papists gather that man may liue monasticall liues in cloisters woods dens cels ampc from the societie and company of man but this their collection is but fond as may appeare by these reasons first christ did this by the speciall motion and direction of god spirit they go into their cels without any warrant from god secondly he went but once for a certaine time they continue alwaies there thirdly christ during his abode in the wildernesse fasted and abstained from all sustenance but those amongst the papists that liue monasticall and solitarie liues enioy all their pleasure and delights in eating and drink and therefore though solitarinesse at some times is commendable to fit vs for meditation prayer repentance ampc yet to liue continually without the company and societie man is neither commendable nor warrantable to be tempted of the diuell here is the en wherefore christ was led of the spirit int the wildernesse namely to be tempted of th diuell now this action to tempt is ascribed t god to man and to the diuell the lord said to tempt when he proueth and maket triall of his children to make manifest wha hidden thing is in their hearts gen abraham was tempted by god when he offered his son secondly man is said to tempt god wh as he shall by unlawful meanes trie the prouidence power mercy and iustice of god thirdly the diuel is said to tempt when he allures by some suggestion inwardly by some obiect outwardly and in this thi sense it is vnderstood here that the diuell di tempt christ that is sought to allure him some meanes to sinne and though chri could haue confounded satan by a word his mouth yet notwithstanding he did wi lingly permit and suffer him to tempt him because now he stood in our stead and this was a part of his sufferance to be thus tempted of the diuell but how could christ be tempted seeing he was most holy euen as he was man ans for all that he might be tempted as our first parents were before they had sinned the diuel tempts man either by conueying into their minds some secret suggestion or else moues them by some outward obiect that he may put into them some conceipt of that sin which he would haue them commit as vnto iudas the diuel cast this vile thought into his heart iudas betray thy maister john so here the diuell suggests vnto the mind of christ these motions to moue him to vnbeleefe idolatry and couetousnesse but here is the difference first that christ his most holy heart withstands all satans temptations againe as these wicked motions disquiet and trouble mens minds and bring molestations vpon them so it befell our sauiour christ for he was moued with these temptations but yet without all sin thirdly man when they are tempted though they do not altogether receiue and approoue of the temptations yet they be tainted with them but yet christ was neuer so much as any whi tainted nor his holy heart did euer approue of them in any sort but constantly repelled them as if a man cast a match into tinder will catch fire and burne but cast it into water it will quench it so temptations coming into our hearts which be like vnto tinder we are easily tainted with them though we d not altogether entertaine them but the most holy heart of christ was as water to quench them at the first the diuell tempts man with sundry blasphemous horrible and vncleane thoughts now that we may discerne them and keepe our selues from despaire when we find them in vs we must know that in the mind there be many cogitations which arise of the flesh and from our owne corrupt hearts and these be sinne besides these there be other cogitations conueyed aud suggested vnto vs by th diuell and these be the diuels temptations but no sinnes to vs vnlesse we entertain them receiue and approoue of them they b indeed our crosses but satans sinnes fo christ was tempted by the diuell but with standing and repelling his temptations an not giuing the least approbation of them h was free from sinne and remained holy aft he was thus tempted the causes wherfore christ was tempted are these first because he was to vanquish the diuel in his owne kind and at his owne weapon and as the first adam was ouercome by his temptations so now the second adam christ iesus might vanquish him in the midst of all his most fierce temptations secondly he was tempted that by his example he might teach vs how to resist temptations as also to shew what temptations are and the power of them and therefore that common opinion that if any be grieuously tempted man thinke they be notorious sinners and hauing forsaken god he now hath forsaken them it is a false and erronious opinion for here we see that the most holy son of god himselfe was tempted againe seeing christ the head was tempted no member of christ must looke to be free from temptation but we must euen make account to be tempted lastly our sauiour christ was tempted that so feeling the waight and daunger of temptations he might be a mercifull high priest to helpe vs in our temptations as the apostle doth witnesse the next point to be noted is the cause and author of his temptation he was tempted of the diuell this name diuell signifieth a cauililer a slaunderer a priuie accuser for he accuseth god to man as he did to euah gen hath god said indeed ye shall die nay but it is because god loues you not for when ye eate of the tree god knoweth ye shal be like vnto god secondly the diuel accuseth man to god and is therefore called the accuser of the brother one which ceasseth not to put vp bils of accusation against vs and to accuse vs vnto god as he dealt with iob thirdly the diuell accuseth one man to another by raising suspitions and bad surmises and by backbiting one another and seeing the holy ghost calleth satan an accuser let vs all beware of accusing our brother of slaundering and backbiting for such man become like vnto the diuell againe it must admonish al man to beware that they do not by any accusations or slanders seeke to draw man from embracing the gospell for they which take this course make themselues diuels incarnate of this sort was elyma the sorcerer act whom paul therefore calleth the child of the diuel and thus much of the first part of the preparation now followeth the second part viz the abode of christ in the wildernesse which is set out by three circumstances first by his fasting forty daies and forty nights secondly by his company there namely the wild beast manke lastly by those temptations wherewith the diuell did incounter him within the space of those fortie dayes luke though the particulars be not set downe by the euangelists the first point is christs fasting in the wildernesse the space of fortie dayes there be three sorts of fastings first a dayly fast which is nothing else but the vertue of sobrietie or a moderate vsing of the creatures of god with abstinence and this kind of fasting all man must vse continually and we must take heed of the abuse of god creatures by surfetting and drunkennesse rom the second kind of fasting is a religious fast when we abstaine from meate and drink for a certaine time that we may be more fit for the exercises of repentance prayer and duties of religion and this kind of fasting the iewes vsed sometimes for one meale sometimes for two or three sometimes for many as sam they fasted seuen dayes the third is a miraculous fast when any one shall fast many dayes and that beyond the course of nature thus moses fasted fortie daies and fortie nights in the mountaine and so fasted elijah now there is no man able to fast so long by the course of nature indeed paul did fast three dayes after his conuersion and those which were with paule in the ship in that dangerous voyage act are said to haue fasted foureteene dayes which though some thinke is not meant of abstaining from all sustenance but that they did eate very litle yet the words are plaine that they did eate nothing for the space of foureteene dayes and though it be true that phisitions affirme that a man may liue seuenteene dayes without meate yet he cannot endure longer as twentie or thirtie dayes now our sauiour christ fasted fortie dayes and fortie nights and for all this his complexion was not changed nor the strength of his bodie weakened nay he was not hungrie till the end though man cannot fast a short time but it wil weaken them and make them hungry which doth proue this fast of christ was miraculous now there be some reasons why christ fasted so long and no longer first that when he came to preach the gospell he might come with more authoritie and reuerence as when moses had fasted fortie dayes and brought the two tables the people receiued him with greater reuerence so likewise elijah when he was to restore religion he fasted forty dayes and forty nights secondly he fasted so long that he might answer vnto the time that moses and elijah fasted thirdly he fasted no longer lest any man should call into question his humanitie whether he was true man yes or no if he had fasted threescore or an hundred dayes from this miraculous fast of christ the papists fondly gather their superstitious fast in lent being but an apish imitatio of christ and in truth their fasting is no fast but a plaine mocke fast seeing they eate as liberally and fare as daintily then as at any other time of the yeare whereas christ abstained from all vse of meate and drinke secondly christ was moued thereunto by the instinct of god holy spirit they haue no word to warrant them thirdly christ did thus fast but once in all his life but their fast is continuall euery yeare and therefore these reasons proue that their collection is friuolous the second speciall point to be marked in the abode of our sauior christ in the wildernesse is his conuersing with the wild beast marke some say the cause of his conuersing among the wild beast was that they might do him that homage which is due to the creator but this opinion hath no warrant out of the word of god and litle truth in it for though it be true that iesus christ is worthy of all homage yet he came not to this end into the world but rather to take on him the shape of a servant but the true cause is this whereas there be two kinds of wildernesses one which was inhabited and where john baptist did baptize amp preach and another not inhabited where liued all kinds of wild beast as lions tygers beares ampc christ made choise of that which was without the societie of man wherein were onely the wild beast to beare him company that so in this great combat against the diuell he might shew he had no aide nor comfort of any man but that he ouercame by his owne power and therefore the honour and praise of the victory belonged to christ iesus alone and besides in the person of christ we may behold the estate of god church here vpon earth that she liueth here with wicked man which be no better then wild beast as esay doth testifie the third circumstance whereby the abode of christ in the wildernesse is described be those temptaions which befell him within the compasse of the forty dayes for before the three great conflicts luke there is mention made of other temptations which though they be not specified yet it is very likely that the diuell did set vpon christ by sundrie small light and weaker temptations thereby making an entrance to his fiercer and stronger temptations for it is the diuels maner to go on and to proceed by degrees in his temptations as first he cast into cains mind an angry thought against his brother abel after he preuailed and caine had conceiued displeasure against his brother then he proceedeth to tempt him to murther and there he did not stay till he had brought him to vtter despaire so he dealt with iudas first he put into iudas mind this thought iudas betray thy maister which though iudas did receiue at the first yet after he letteth it ta place and then the diuell proceedeth by d grees with him till he had brought him to h purpose and it is the diuels subtiltie first get if it be but a talent in then he will thr in his foote yes his head and wind in hi whole bodie out of this subtile dealing of the diuel that he begins with less temptations an proceeds by degrees it must teach vs to b wise and to labour that we may stop the fir motions and inclinations to sin to resist th very beginnings to euill for if satan preuail in them he will proceed to more forcibl temptations the fourth and last point in the abode christ in the wildernesse is in these word he was afterward an hungrie that is when h had by the diuine power and vertue of h godhead fasted forty daies and forty night he was at the last hungry and this christ di for our sakes for though christ was the so of god yet for our good he was content t take our nature vpon him and became tru man like vnto vs in all things excepting sin and had not onely the will mind affection and conscience of man but also tooke vpon him the infirmities of humane nature so farre foorth as they be without sinne and therefore he was subiect to hunger and thirst the causes wherefore our sauiour christ was hungrie are these first that he might hew himself to be true man and that he had he infirmities of humane nature and so we see he would stop the mouthes of such as should say it was a small matter for him to last so long being the son of god but least we should doubt of his manhood he is here s we see touched with hunger a true infirmitie of mans nature secondly he was thus hungrie that by this meanes he might cast vnto the diuell an ob ect to worke on and giue him occasion to be more fierce in his assaults then came to him the tempter and said here begins the first combat betweene the diuel and christ and in it we are to consider three especiall points first the diuels preparation then came to him the tempter and said secondly the temptation it selfe in these words if thou be the son of god commaund that these stones be made bread thirdly the answer and repulse of christ verse in the preparation note first the author the tempter secondly the time then thirdly the occasion of this temptation namely the hunger of christ fourthly the diuels coming vnto christ the author is here intituled the tempter s thess and the cause why he is so called is because it is his desire his studie and continuall practise to tempt man and to seeke as much as he can to draw man from god to his kingdome and to this purpose he sparet no paines night and day assaulting and tempting man to bring them to destruction he goeth about as a roring lion seeking whom he may deuoure well then seeing we know it is the diuels study night and day to tempt vs it should teach vs all as we loue our soules to watch and pray continually least we be led into temptations and so be ouercome of satan it is our dutie to seeke to be as vnlike the diuell as possibly we can because he is the patterne of al euill now we see it is the diuel study to hinder man from the kingdome of heauen and so to bring them to hell then o the contrary seeing he labours to draw me from seruing of god we should quicken vp our selues in the seruice and worship of god and to be more careful to seeke the kingdom of god our selues and to draw others to the same we must beware that we be no meanes to draw any from embracing of true religion and from the seruice and worship of god for if we do we become eue diuels incarnate when christ went vp to ierusalem to performe the worke of mans redemption peter he begins to disswade him from it and bids him fauour himselfe but christ turneth him backe and saith get thee behind me satan the second thing is the time when the diuell sets vpon christ then namely when he perceiued christ most weake and as he thought not able to resist him herein appeareth the pollicie of satan when he seeth christ most weake the diuell taketh occasion to lay his strongest assaults so then in the example of christ we may see the exceeding pollicie of the diuell in tempting of man namely he maketh choise of the fittest time to broach his temptations for he marketh amp prieth into man and woman and when he findeth vs most weake and most vnable to resist him then is he the most strong in tempting vs especially at the houre of death and in the time of afflictios he bendeth the force of his temptations against vs oh then how should this admonish vs al to prepare our selues against the day of afflictio and the pangs of death to be stedfast in the faith to make our calling and election sure that so we may neuer finally fall away and to intreate the lord that then when we seeme to be most weake he would aide and strengthen vs by his holy spirit to resist satan assaults the third point in the diuels preparation i the occasion wherby the diuel was especially moued to tempt christ which was his hunger such was satans malice against the lord iesus that when he could find no sin in him then he takes aduantage of christs infirmity and seeing him now hungry begins to tempt him to vnlawful means to satisfie his hunger now then seeing the diuell takes occasion to tempt christ euen from the infirmitie of his humane nature as he was man hence we learne whence the diuell hath the ground of all his temptations namely from our selues and from our own nature and we our selue affoord him the matter of his temptations h brings the fire and bloweth it but we affoord him the fewell to set it a work the diuell obserueth the nature of man their dispositions inclinations and behauiours and continually prieth into their dealings and like vnto a prudent captain who besieging a citie marketh where it is most weake and of least resistance and there he bends all his forces and placeth his greatest ordinance euen so the diuel watcheth vs and our behauiours to obserue vnto what sin we be most addicted and by nature most inclined amp then he followes our humor and feeds vs in our owne vaine as if a man be impatient of pouertie he will egge him to stealing and to unlawful shifts to helpe himself if a man be couetous he wil help to prick him forward that way that he may by hook or crooke inrich himselfe and so in other sins according as he finds man affected he will fit his temptations nay the diuell is so skilfull by the experience of so many hundred yeares that he will be prying into mens complexions and the very constitutious of their body and finding what humour doth most a bound he can giue a shrewd guesse to what sinne a man is inclined as if he perceiue a man to be of a cholericke complexion then the diuell will stirre him vp to quarrelling fighting and killing if he find a mans complexion to be sanguine then he seeketh to allure him to be delighted with vaine and vngodly mirth and wantonnes or at the least with immoderate mirth a man be subiect to melancholy then he wil feare a man with heauy amp dumpish thoughts and great feares and cares in his mind and thus he dealt with the poore man that wa lunatick for the diuel tooke occasion by the course of the moone and the humour of hi bodie to moue him to cast himselfe into the fire and into the water and in a word look how many infirmities amp weaknesses we haue we do as it were giue the diuel so many dar to wound vs withall for we giue him the matter of all his temptations and he taket aduantage of our weaknesse and infirmities this being satans cunning amp his dealing it must warne euery man to search his own heart to find what be his speciall infirmities and corruptions to which he is most pron by nature and when we know them we mu labour against them to represse and subdu them otherwise they will be so many dart and weapons which satan will turne against our owne selues to hurt and wound vs and therefore it must be our wisdome to weake these infirmities and to labour by all goo meanes to preuent the diuell in these hi temptations the fourth point in the preparation of the diuell vnto his temptations is his coming vnto christ and by this that it is said the tempter came vnto him it appeareth that he came in some visible forme as he did come to euah in the shape of a serpent so it is very likely he came in some bodily shape to our sauiour christ seeing it is said here that he came and spake vnto him if thou be the son of god ampc the diuel hauing made this solemne preparation and hauing made choise of the fittest place and time and taken aduantage of the infirmitie of our sauiour christ now he sets vpon him and incounters christ with his first temptation wherein the cunning diuel disputeth like a subtill sophister and disputeth very syllogistically and his syllogisme may be framed thus if thou be the son of god then thou canst commaund that these stones be made bread but thou canst not make these stones bread therefore thou article not the son of god the maine scope of the diuels disputation in this his first temptation was this to bring christ to distrust of his fathers prouidence to ouerturne the faith of christ that is that gift in christ whereby he as he was man did beleeue in god his father and depend vpon him and in this dealing of the diuel with christ we may behold what is the maine and principall end of all satans temptations in the children of god viz he labors to bring vs if it be possible to this to make shipwracke of faith whereby we beleeue the word of god to be true and thus he dealt with euah gen he did labor to bring her to call god word into question and so to deny credence to it and thus he dealeth with all man seeking to keepe them in ignorance and blindnesse o else in errors and wickednesse that they may not beleeue the truth of god word and performe obedience to it the special part of the word of god which the diuell aymed at and which he labored to bring christ to deny credit too is that voice of god the father coming from heauen this is my beloued son in whom i am well pleased and here let vs see the practise of satan against all the faithful children of god namely as he dealt with our sauior christ to perswade him if he could that he was not th son of god so he labours to perswade god children that they are not the sonnes and daughters of god he labours to make m doubt of their adoption and therefore seeing the diuel aimeth at this one thing especially to ouerturne our faith in god promises it should stir vs all vp to an earnest care to make our calling and election sure euen to haue it sealed vp by comfortable assurance to our soules and this will be a most sweet comfort vnto vs in time of affliction if we can find this blessed and setled perswasion that we are the sonnes and daughters of god and the diuell he careth not what man professe no though they haue all the common gifts of god spirit to heare the word to vnderstand to giue assent vnto it so that they want this blessed assurance of god speciall loue in christ againe in this first temptation the diuell tempts christ to practise a worke of vnbeleefe for now christ wanting bread the diuell tempts him in the absence and want of bread to make bread of stones and so by unlawful meanes to help himselfe and as the diuell dealt here with christ seeking to tempt him to practise a work of vnbeleefe so doth he deale with vs to moue man and woman in time of distresse to vse bad and unlawful shifts to helpe themselues as in time of pouerty and want when man see not ordinary means such as they desire he will tempt them to shift for themselues to filch and pilfer from their neighbors and to get bread by bad meanes in time of sicknesse when man cannot find help in the lawful vse of phisick then he labours to draw them to seeke to the diuell for helpe by sending man to wise man and woman as they call them and so by wicked meanes to seeke recouery of their health if thou be the son of god what moued the diuell to moue this question vnto christ rather then any other ans first because the diuel knew right wel that if christ were the son of god then he was that promised messiah and sauiour of the world and if he were that promised messiah then he knew it was he that should bruise the serpents head gen now of all things the diuell could not abide to heare of that and therfore he makes choise of this question before all other to proue or at least to go about to proue that christ was not the son of god another reason may be this since the diuel fell and for his pride was cast downe out of heauen he beares a deadly hatred against the lord god himselfe and we shall see that this question he doth notably bewray hi spite against god for when as the lord ha spoken from heauen saying this is my beloued son in whom i am well pleased here the diuell comes and contradicts the voice of god nay goeth about to proue god a lier in that he would make christ beleeue that he was not the true son of god hence we may by this practise of satan learne to discerne false teachers there haue bene many both excellent and learned man which haue denied christ to be the son of god as ebeon cerinthus and others onely affirming that christ was an excellent man and a worthy prophet now seeing they denie iesus christ to be the true son of god they shew themselues to be false teachers and such as be the diuels scholers for so saith the apostle john iohn again in that the diuel seekes to perswade christ that he is not the son of god though god by his owne voice from heauen had immediatly before proclaimed him to be his son hence we may perceiue the impudent malice of satan who seeketh in all things to contradict god himself for if the lord pronounce a blessing vpon any man the diuell he wil presently pronounce cursing and damnation if god testifie to a mans soule that he is the child of god the diuell he wil labour to perswade him that he is not the child of god if the lord affirme a wicked man to be out of god fauor and no child of god the diuel will labour on the contrary to perswade him that he is in good estate amp shal be saued and so fils his heart with extreme presumption amp maketh him more bold then he ought to be commaund that is as if satan should haue said to christ bid this or do but speake the word and it shall be done and herein appeareth the maruellous pollicy of satan who in these few words the better to bring his purpose to passe toucheth three especiall points of diuinitie first that he which is the son of god is true god equal to the father which many heretickes haue denied and the pharisies also did not graunt for to worke a miracle it is the proper and peculiar work of god alone secondly the diuell confesseth that god is able to make all things of nothing and that without all meanes matter or helpers by his almightie power thirdly he confesseth that god can effect a true miracle and that is proper to god alone neither can any creature whatsoeuer worke a miracle now when the diuel acknowledged al this one would haue thought he should haue intended no harme in these words but the truth is we shall see that in the propounding of these points his pollicy was to ouerthrow the faith of christ and he in propounding of the truth doth it not for any loue or liking to it but that he might more easily deceiue our sauiour to bring him to doubt whether he was indeed that son of god or not this must admonish vs to take heed that we do not alwayes giue credit to the diuel amp listen vnto him though he speake the truth for such is satans pollicie that when he wold seeme most to speake the truth then he meaneth to deceiue vs most and by speaking the truth he seeketh most to ouerthrow our faith in the truth but as our sauiour christ did refuse their testimonie though the diuels spake the truth and as paul did not suffer the diuel to speak in the maid though he did acknowledge the apostles to be the servant of the true god so we must beware how we listen to satan euen when he speakes the truth for he neuer speakes the truth because he loueth the truth but that speaking the truth he might be sooner beleeued and more easily deceiue vs and do vs the greater harme that these stones s luke saith this stone in the singular nomber to reconcile these two places whereas mathew speaks in the plural number of many stones this we must vnderstand that he speakes of satans temptations as he first set vpon christ and then in the beginning of his temptation he bids christ to turne all these stones into bread luke he saying this stone speaking but of one must be vnderstood as the diuell vrged and inforced his temptation the better to perswade christ to yeeld vnto it as if the diuell should haue said it may be thou thinkest it too much to turne all these stones being so many into bread do but turne this one stone into bread because i would not trouble thee ouermuch that so i may beleeue thou article the son of god by this dealing of the diuel with christ we may learne that when the diuell hath once begun his temptation then he will be more instant in vrging of it he is very loth to haue the repulse and therefore will vrge it and follow it but if he can gaine but a litle ground at least in some smaller matter he would be content as here to perswade christ though he would not turne many stones into bread that he would turne but this one stone into bread and therefore we must learne that as the diuell is very instant to inforce and vrge his temptations so we must be as instant to resist them and yeeld no not in the least matter that he tempts vs to verse but he answering said man shall ot liue by bread onely but by euerie word that roceedeth out of the mouth of god these words containe the most wise and heauenly nswer of our sauior christ to the first temptation of the diuell and in this answer of his note three points first the answer it self and iesus answering said secondly whence our sauior christ took his answer it is writte thirdly the words of his answer man shal not liue ampc first the spirit of god sets downe the answer of christ to shew that he was not onely willing to incounter the diuell but that he was most able to vanquish amp foile the diuell now what a singular comfort is this to god church and children to remember that our lord and sauior christ iesus was in his base estate of a servant whe he liued here vpon earth able to incounter with satan to ouercome the diuell notwithstanding all his might and malice how much more is iesus christ able now being aduanced vnto the right hand of god his father in heauen hauing all power and maiestie and being king of kings and lord of all lord how much more able is he now to confound satan amp to destroy al the works of the diuel in his members and this may be a great comfort vnto euery beleeuer in the midst of temptations it is written here we see whence our sauior christ tooke his answer though that could haue confounded satan by the lea word of his mouth and could if he had pleased called for many legions of angel from heauen to haue guarded him being th true and onely son of god yet he mak choise of this weapon it is written and th he did to teach vs that the most sufficien weapon to beat back all satans temptation and to quench all the fierie darts of the diue is the word of god written amp therefore bids vs take vp the sword of the spirit whi is the word of god both to defend our selu and also to put satan to flight ephesian hence from the example of christ we ma learne sundry instructions first seeing th he made choise of the word of god as th most sufficient weapon to repel satan it condemneth that vaine and vile practise of th church of rome who instead of this into mens hands other weapons not wor a rush as holy water the signe of the cross ampc and affirmeth that these be sufficient we pons to skarre away the diuell alas th diuell is not so childish to feare a drop water or the shaking of a straw but our sa iour christ shewes what is that which is ab a most sufficient weapon to beate back all atans temptations which he can hurle a ainst vs and therefore wicked is the pra tise of the papists who locke vp the word of god from the people keeping it in an vn nowne tong and so betray the poore soules f the people into the hands of the diuell we see here the miserable estate of all such en or woman which do either contemne r neglect the knowledge of the word of god they do wilfully betray themselues in o the hands of the diuell lay themselues o en as a prey vnto him so as they hauing no eapon to defend themselues nor to repell atan thus he smites them amp wounds them ea euen cuts the throat of their poore soules efore they be aware we may hece gather what is the cause why o many sins abound in euery place namely e vile and grosse ignorance of the word of god hos the want of the knowledge of the gospell and the word of god is the ery cause that sin so abounds in al places for he word of god should be vnto vs as sauls eare which he vsed to set at his beds head that if any enemy set vpo vs on the sodain ur weapo might be euer at hand in readines hat we might answer the diuel in his instruments if he tempt vs to any sin whatsoeu that as here christ said it is written so must say i may not lie sweare commit ad tery ampc for it is written ampc seeing christ by his own practise teache vs that the word of god written beleeue vnderstood amp truly applied is the most al and all sufficient weapon to resist the diue how ought this to stirre vp all man to serio studie of the word of god how should moue euery man as he loueth his soule to bor for a sound knowledge amp vnderstanding of the holy scripture seeing this is the b weapon to foile the diuell if we knew th any man had vowed our death and sough our liues how careful wold we be to proui the best weapons we could get and also learne how to handle them and to vse the so as we might be able to defend our selue when we meet with our enemy wel we not be ignorant that the diuell is the swo enemy of our soules he lies in waite conti ally seeking our bloud oh then if man that care of their poore soules that they oug to haue how prouident would it make the to store themselues with this most sufficie weapon eue the true knowledge of the w of god and therfore it must moue all of v eare the word continually to study it to lay t vp in our hearts against the time of need o resist the diuell when he assaults vs it is lamentable to consider how poore ignorant people deceiue them selues they ooth themselues and say they defie the di uel they spit at him but alas what if two man that be enemy meet together the one well appointed with weapons of death the other hauing nothing in his hand to defend himself but defies his enemy spits at him wil this do him any good will not the other wound him and kil him and so though poore ignorant people say they defie the diuell amp spit at him he wil shew them no pity but giue them their deadly wound and they shall neuer know who hurt them till it be too late now follow the words of christs answer man shall not liue by bread onely ampc this answer of christ is taken out of deut where moses shews the children of israel who were now in great extremitie pinched sore with famine and had nothing to eate that the lord fed them with manna to teach them that man liues not by bread only but by euery word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god man shall not liue that is man shall not preserue his naturall or temporall life in t world i say his natural or temporal life fo is not meant of his spiritual life by bread that is all things necessary for the naturall of man as meate drinke clothing sleep p sick ampc euen all naturall and ordinary mea vsed of man for his temporall life is meant b bread but by euery word he saith not in genera by the word but by euery word now hath diverse acceptions in the scriptures first it is take for the second person in the trinity john secondly for the word of god is but neither of these is vnderstood i this place thirdly the word is taken for th decree and wil of god for his prouidence the good wil amp pleasure of god and so m we vnderstand it in this place where our sauiour christ saith man shall liue by eue word that is euery decree and blessing o god for the life of man so it is taken heb where christ is said to beare vp all things by his mightie word that is as the lord ha created al things so doth he vphold and preserue them by his decree and prouidence now god word and decree concerning the life of man may thus be distinguished namely that god hath decreed that some man should liue by bread that is by ordinary meanes secondly some should liue without ordinary bread that is without all ordinary meanes thirdly that some should liue without any means at al either ordinary or extraordinary as moses eliah our sauiour christ in their fortie dayes fast fourthly that some should liue against meanes and contrary to the course of nature as daniel in the lions den amp the three children in the fiery fornace which proceedeth out of the mouth of god that is by euery decree of god by euery blessing amp decree that god giueth out concerning the life of man so then we see the meaning of the words if any say it seemes we must liue onely by the word of god amp without meate or drink euen by the scriptures and the written word i answer no but we must liue and preserue our liues by euery word that is euery decree that god giueth out to preserue the life of man so that without the speciall decree and blessing of god nothing could preserue and maintain the life of man our meat could not norish vs our apparel could not warm vs ampc now let vs see how this answer of christ is applied to the diuels temptation the diuel had labored to proue that christ was not the son of god his argument was this if th be the son of god commaund that the stones be made bread but thou canst no make these stones bread therefore thou not the son of god our sauior christ doth alleage this plac of scripture and doth deny the proposition or first part of the diuels argumet for where as the diuell takes this for graunted that if man be hungry he must haue bread by an meanes to preserue his life christ answers is not necessary because a mans life is no preserued by bread onely but it is maintained by the special decree amp blessing of god and indeed this is a speciall point and wo thy lesson to be learned as may appeare i that the lord was no lesse then fortie yeares teaching it to the children of israel deu the vse of this doctine is manifold first hence we learne to consider aright of th creatures of god namely that we do no content our selues to looke vpon the substance of them but besides the outward substance we must consider the secret blessing o god vpon his creatures proceeding from hi word that is his decree as for example must not onely looke vpon the outward substance of bread but besides that we m consider the blessing and decree of god that bread should be the meanes to nourish man for besides the bread there is the staffe of bread that is that power and facultie whereby it nourisheth and maintaineth life which it hath from the decree and blessing of god vpon it and as we see an old weake man take away his staffe and he wil soone fall to the ground euen so if the lord take away the staffe of bread that is his secret blessing though a man had all the dainties vnder heauen his life would faile in the midst of the all for the weake life of man must needs fal amp decay if once the lord take away the staffe of bread for what reason is there that bread which hath no life in it should nourish our body giue life amp stregth to vs and that that which hath no heate in it as our cloth should keepe vs warme were it not for god word and decree and his blessing vpon them and that we may know that it is not so much bread that preserueth mans life as god blessing vpon bread by vertue of his word and decree we may see it plainely in that the poore mans child which fareth hardly amp is but meanely clothed is as well legged and and likes as well euen as the child of the prince now the reason is because god blessing is all in all vpon the poore fare of the poore mans child aswell as the kings againe seeing it is not so much bread as god blessing vpon bread that preserueth mans life it should teach vs al sobriety in the vse of god creatures for neither meate nor drinke nor clothing can do vs good vnlesse the lord send out his word and decree and giue a blessing vnto them euen to euerie b of bread we put into our mouthes now if we abuse the good creatures of god in sur etting and excesse how can we looke that the lord should blesse them vnto vs nay we may rather feare he will curse them for our abuse and intemperancie so that they shall hurt yes choake vs rather then do vs good we must learne from hence to vse the creatures of god with inuocation vpon his name for a blessing vpon them for seeing it is not the substance of bread that nourisheth vs but the blessing of god vpon the bread who seeth not that we ought before we vse the creatures of god to craue a blessing god vpon them this should teach vs to be content with our estate to moderate our affections and to take heed we do not so eagerly desire amp see for abundance for the blessing of god is riches enough amp hath not these cutting cares with it amp he which hath but a meane estate may be as wel blessed of god as he that hath the greatest abundance nay this immoderate seeking for abundance it argueth great distrust and vnbeleefe in the prouidence of god if mans life stands not in abundance and our life is not preserued by bread alone though a man had all the bread in the world vnlesse god infuse a blessing into it this teacheth vs that we may not be so much intangled with the things of this life we must not so eagerly seeke after meat drinke clothing lands liuings gold siluer ampc for in taking too much care for these things we see many mens harts are so caried away that no grace can take place in them but you will say meate drinke cloathing and such things they be my liuing i cannot liue without them i aunswer that our liues do not stand in these things alone but especially in the blessing of god vpon these meanes without which though we had all the world at commaund it could doe vs no good againe the lord can not onely preserue our liues by bread but euen without all meanes yes if so it please him against meanes now then seeing our liues stand not in these meanes but especially in the blessing of god vpon them we must first seeke for the blessing of god without the which all these meanes shal become vnprofitable vnto vs and do vs no good and it is not wisedome too greedily to seeke for the things of the world seeing our life is not preserued by them alone mans life standeth not in abundance saith christ luke seeing man liues not by bread alone that is mans life is not maintained by these outward meanes but by god blessing vpon them this must teach vs all to be content with that estate the lord sends vs though it be poore and meane and we must learne patience in extreame miseries and afflictions and if the lord should deal with vs as he did with his servant iob eue all from vs yet we must be content and take heed that we do not suffer our selues to be swallowed vp of too much griefe for our life is not maintained by these outward meanes of themselues but by god blessing vpon the which is all in all and when all meanes faile the lord can preserue our life euen without bread and against meanes too if he please indeed if a man wated the outward meanes and the inward meanes too namely god blessing then he had some cause to be grieued but seeing the lord can saue our liues both without all outward meanes and against meanes though we want bread yet let vs cast our selues vpon the lord and neuer distrust his mercie but say with iob though the lord kill me yet will i trust in him and let vs know the lord can increase the poore womans cruse of oile and make it last as well as the rich mans abundance this should teach vs all to moderate our affectiones and to carrie an euen saile so as neither in the estate of wealth and abundance we be not puffed vp with pride nor yet in pouertie to be ouerwhelmed with sorrow for though a man haue abundance it followes not that he is therefore blessed nor if he be poore and want riches that he is therfore cursed and wants the blessing of god but in wealth and pouertie the blessing of god is all in all to make man happie lastly this should teach euery one of vs to labour all our life long to know the prouidence of god and to depend vpon it in all estates of life whatsoeuer the lord shall send vs and when we can see this prouidence of god we must then hang vpon it as well in aduersitie as prosperitie in sicknes and health in life and death true it is man can acknowledge god prouidence in prosperitie but we must learne to see the prouidence of god aswell in aduersity and then to hang vpon it with both the hands of faith so as we can roule our selues vpon it and can euen wholly depend vpon it and commit our selues and all our waies to the lord the children of israel were fortie yeares learning this lesson which shewes it is an excellent point and not easily learned and therefore seeing it is of so great vse and so necessarie let vs studie to know the prouidence of god and shew the true vse of it in our liues and conuersations then the diuell tooke him into the holy citie ampc now followeth the second conflict between the diuell and christ in the verses now though s luke chap placeth this temptation in the last place yet doth this breede no great difference between the euangelists for luke in pening of the words and deeds of christ sets them downe as the spirit of god directed him not regarding precisely the time when they were done but sometime setting that first which was done last but mathew he sets the down in order as they were performed by our sauiour christ then the diuell tooke him ampc in this second coflict we are to consider three points first the diuels preparation to the combat verse secondly the temptation it selfe verse thirdly the answer of christ verse in the diuels preparation first the time then secondly the parts of his preparation which be two first he tooke christ from the wildernesse and caried him to the holy citie secondly he setteth him there vpon a pinnacle of the temple first in the circumstance of time then that is as soone as satan had taken a repulse and was foiled of christ in the wildernesse he presently setteth vpon him afresh and caries him to the holy citie to tempt him there by this we may perceiue the malice of the diuell who as soone as he hath ended one temptation ceasseth not there but presently prouideth another the diuell neuer maketh truce with man but either he is busie in tempting of vs or else he is deuising and plotting new temptations for he is neuer idle againe hence we learne that when we haue ouercome in one temptation we must presently prepare our selues for another we must not look to be at ease when we haue giuen the diuell the foile for he will set vpon vs afresh and tempt vs againe and againe nay our life is a continuall warfare against sinne and satan amp therfore we must euer be in a readines to encounter with our enemie and if this lesson were well learned and as well practised man would not be so impatient in temptations when they befall the then temptations would be farre more easie to them so as a man wold willingly and chearefully indure them amp vndergo them though neuer so many the diuell tooke him to the holy citie here is the first part of the diuels preparatio now by the holy citie is meant ierusalem as luke it is plaine but how did the diuell carie our sauiour christ from the wildernesse to ierusalem he might do this three waies first in vision secondly by the ordinarie way thirdly cary him in the aire first by vision as it was vsuall in the time of the prophets so ieremiah was caried in vision to the river euphrates but christ could not thus in vision be caried from the wildernesse to ierusalem for then it should haue bene no temptation vnto him in vision onely to cast himselfe from the top of the temple secondly our sauiour christ might be led by the ordinarie way and so indeed the words will beare it but i take it it is not the sense and meaning of this place for if the diuell led our sauior from the wildernesse to ierusalem then either with or against his will either of his owne accord or else at the perswasion of the diuell but he went not of his owne accord for seeing he was led into the wildernesse and came to be tempted there he now being in the conflict and it being not yet ended he would not of his owne accord depart thence to ierusale secondly he would not go at the perswasion of the diuell for we neuer reade that he would do any thing at the diuels perswasion though in it selfe lawful thirdly the diuell might conuey and carie the bodie of our sauiour christ in the aire from the wildernesse to ierusalem and this is the opinion of the best diuines that the diuell had power by god permission to transport the bodie of christ in the aire from the wildernesse to the holy citie and this seemeth to be confirmed by the words following where it is said that the diuell set him on a pinnacle of the temple now it is as likely that he caried christ from the wildernesse thither as that the diuel had power to place and set him on the top of the temple now then if the diuell had permission to transport the bodie of christ from the wildernesse to ierusalem this makes for that opinion which is common in the world that the diuell can carrie a man or woman from one countrey to another if god giue him leaue but so as he cannot do it with such celeritie and expedition as man imagine some foolishly thinke he can carrie one many hundred miles in an houre which is a thing impossible for such a violent motion would stop a mans breath as we see if a man fall from the toppe of an high steeple his wind is gone ere he come halfe the way to the ground againe hence we see that the diuell may by god permission haue power ouer the body of godly man and those which haue greatest graces and strongest faith in god for seeing he had power ouer the bodie of christ to transport it from place to place by the permission of god why may he not if god giue him leaue haue power of any mas bodie though he be neuer so true a beleeuer if he had power in the head why not in the mebers if he had power to annoy iob to kill his childre amp destroy the though they were no doubt the holy servant of god why may not the diuell haue power ouer our body to carie a ma fro one place to another if the diuell could by god permissio tormet the bodie of one that was a daughter of faithfull abraham and euen yeares afflict her so as she was bruised and bowed together by satan then no doubt he can do the lesse to remoue mens body from place to place and this may serue to admonish those who thinke their faith is so strong that the diuel cannot annoy the or any way bewitch them but if the diuell haue power by god permission to torment the body of the faithfull yes to destroy the body of iobs childre who no doubt were the true servant of god he may if god giue him leaue bewitch the godliest man that liueth for we know what the holy ghost faith that all things fall out and all things come alike to good and bad and there is no difference in outward things oftentimes betweene the children of god and the wicked to the holy citie that is ierusalem luke now this citie was called holy for sundrie causes first because in ierusalem was the temple of the lord where were the sacrifices and other ceremonies prescribe by god for his own worship secondly i the temple they had the law of god and the bookes of moses and the prophets read an expounded vnto them thirdly becaus ierusalem was a mother church fro whenc religion did flow and was dispersed into many places of the world now for these considerations ierusalem is called the holy citie this church at ierusalem though it hao many corruptions in it yet our sauiour christ cals it holy and it was a true church of god then hence i conclude that the church of god in england though there be in it many blemishes amp corruptions yet may it be and in truth is the true church of god for the church of god in england is proprotionable to the church at ierusale for as they had moses and the prophets read and expounded so haue we nay we haue the gospell now soundly preached which they then had not in so plaine and plentifull manner as we haue they had the sacraments of the old testament so we haue baptisme and the supper of the lord their church was a mother church to deriue religion to many other and though our church cannot be called a mother church yet it may be truly called a nourcing church to many neighbour churches round about vs as christ and his apostles did not therfore separate themselues or refuse to ioyne with them in the seruice of god because of the corruptions in this church at ierusalem but did teach and preach in the temple so none may therefore separate themselues and refuse to ioyne with the people of god in his seruice and worship because of some few corruptions that remaine in it nay such as for these do separate themselues from god people do cut themselues from christ himselfe seeing they seuer themselues from the church of god if any shall say that the church of rome is the true church of god as well as the church of ierusalem seeing the roman church hath as many priuiledges as the church at ierusalem i answer by examining the particulars it will appeare to the contrarie as first the church of rome braggeth that she hath her succession from the apostles but i answer succession from persons without succession in the apostles doctrine can be no true note of the church secondly the church of rome hath the sacrament of baptisme yet that proues he not the true church for in samaria they had the sacrament of circumcision and so in other places and yet it cannot be proued that they were the true churches of god besides i answer the church of rome hath baptisme no otherwise then a theefe hath a true mans purse now it cannot be said that a theefe is therefore a true man because he hath a true mans purse lastly though the church of rome haue the outward baptisme yet she in doctrine ouerturnes the inward baptisme namely the true imputed iustification and inherent sanctification of christ by the spirit the church of rome holdeth the apostles creed but it is onely in word for the truth is their god whome they worship is an idoll and their christ is a false amp counterfeit christ forged by their owne braine as may appeare to all that will search their doctrine she saith that they hold the word of god and the writings of the apostles but it will appeare in their writings that they hold it but in shew not in truth for in the maine grounds of religion they ouerturne the doctrine of the prophets amp apostles againe they hold the scriptures but as a lanthorn holds the candle not for it selfe but for those that passe by so the church of rome haue the word of god not for themselues but for the good of god children which euer lye hid in the middest of popery she brags that she is the mother church of many churches i answer we must consider that citie as rome is and as rome was the old rome which was in the time of paul was the true church of god but as for that old rome it is dead and buried and this new rome is that whore of babylon amp no mother church but a cruell step mother to religion by al this we may see that the present church of rome is no church of god but onely in name and outward shew and seeing that the diuell tempts our sauiour christ in the holy citie we learne that there is no place so holy but the diuell can broach his temptations in it as we may see zach and therfore this condemnes that dotage and sorcery of the church of rome who teach that their charmed holy water their coniured bread and the signe of the crosse and such stuffe can driue away the diuel from their houses and from their persons and yet we see here that neither the holinesse of christs person nor yet of the place could hinder satan but he did tempt him againe we see it is to small purpose to the ende wee may bee freed from temptations to change the place or to change the aire for what place is there so holy or so sound and wholesome where satan cannot and will not set his temptation on foote and assault vs indeed to remoue the diseases of the body these may be of some force to change the ayre ampc but to cure the conscience and to help the diseases of the soule this and such like can do nothing at all and set him on a pinnacle of the temple here is the second part of the diuels preparat on who hauing caried christ from the wildernes to ierusale now he placeth him vpon a pinnacle of the temple or a litle wing of the teple some think that it was a sharpe broach gilded to some especiall vse but it is either the battlements which were made by god commaundement least any should fall because their houses had flat roofes o else some corner of the temple howsoeuer it was a dangerous place if thou be the son of god cast thy selfe downe ampc in this verse is set downe the second temptation and in a syllogisme it may be thus concluded if thou be the son of god then cast thy selfe downe but thou sayest and article perswaded that thou article the son of god therefore thou mayest cast thy selfe downe here we must marke the scope of the diuell in this second temptation which is this to tempt our sauiour christ to presumption to perswade him to presume of god mercy and to bring him to a vaine confidence in his fathers protection without vsing lawful meanes and in this second temptation we may obserue one especial thing which the diuel aimes at in his temptations namely to perswade him to a vaine presumption of god mercy and surely we see the diuel preuails much in these days by this argument for we see how some man crie god is mercifull god is mercifull and so presume amp grow secure in sinne and take occasion of god mercie to sooth themselues in their sins others they say i am either elected or reiected and if i be elected i am sure i shal be saued howsoeuer i liue if i be reiected i am sure i shall perish though i liue neuer so well and thus man liue as they list others say i know the lord will prouide for me and therefore refuse to liue in any calling and as for those which make profession of the gospell the diuell he labours to perswade them that it is sufficient to professe religion though they practise not the duties of religion as the fiue foolish virgines who held out their blazing lampes yet wanted the vessel of oile to maintaine their lampes this being so it should admonish vs al to take especiall heed that we be not ouer com of satan in this kind seeing the diuell knowes our nature and seeth that to presume and thinke well of our selues it is a thing very fitting and pleasing our nature whereas despaire it is a troublesome thing and brings man often to a greater sight of their misery and the truth is the diuell preuailes with a thousand to one more by presumption then by despaire despaire kils thousands securitie ten thousands and it is to be noted that when the diuell had in the former temptation laboured to bring christ to despaire of his fathers prouidence now he labours the cleane contrary to bring him to presume of god prouidence and here we may see the diuels exceeding cuning that he fought to cary our sauiour christ from one extreame to another and thus doth the diuell deale with all man he seeks to draw man either to presumption or else to despaire and labors to cary them from one extreame to another as from couetousnes to prodigalitie and so of the rest and therefore we must labour to auoide both the extreames neither to presume too much nor yet to be cast downe by despaire but to keepe the golden mediocritie euen as christ doth in this place cast thy selfe downe he would haue christ not to shew by his doctrine but to worke a miracle that he may know him to be the son of god this shewes the nature of all wicked man they care not for the doctrine of god but they crie out for miracles as we may see in herod he desired to see our sauiour christ worke some miracle but he contemned his word and doctrine and the iewes who persecuted christ and his gospel yet when he was vpon the crosse they would haue him worke a miracle to come downe when he was nailed hand and foote and all wicked man are of the same nature more to regard and desire a miracle then to heare the blessed doctrine of iesus christ cast thy selfe downe the diuel hauing proued before the faith of christ to be most costant that he would not so much as doubt of his fathers prouidence in his greatest need now he takes occasion from the graces and gifts of christ to bring him to presume and to haue a vain confidence of his fathers protection and so wil the diuel deale with all the members of christ if he cannot preuaile by our weaknesses to bring vs to despaire then he wil take occasio by the graces and gifts he sees in vs to make vs presume as often he preuailes by this meanes to make man swell and thinke highly of themselues for some grace they haue receiued of learning wit eloquence ampc to puffe man vp with satanicall pride and ouerweening o themselues then cast thy selfe downe the lord gaue the diuel permission to place christ in a dangerous place but yet the diuell coul not go any further to hurt christ there cast him downe he had no power but perswades him to cast himselfe downe where we see the diuels power is limited his power is not so great as his malice is to mankind but the lord doth limit satans power and in all things hath care of his owne children that satan can do them no harme for the diuel though he had set christ vpon the top of the temple could not for his life cast him downe where we may see the diuell for all his malice can go no further then god giues him leaue and this must comfort vs for as god the father limits satan in respect of christ our head so doth he in vs his members now followes the reason which the diuel vseth the better to perswade christ to yeeld vnto his temptation for it is written he shall giue his angels charge ouer thee when as the diuell heard our sauiour christ alleage scripture he like an ape imitates christ and begins to alleage scripture roundly as wel as he and therfore we must be wary how we entertaine doctrines of heretikes and false teachers though they seeme to proue them by the scriptures for the diuel he hath his scriptum est it is written as ready as may be but we must learne to proue the spirits that is the doctrines of man whether they be of god or not john lest the diuel and wicked man deceiue vs for we see here how the diuel can alleage scripture and that fitly for his purpose and it is the subtil practise of the diuel to alleage scripture that so he may perswade man to receiue his damnable doctrines and become heretickes and scismatickes and to this end he doth grosly abuse the scriptures yes when he would perswade man to liue in sinne he hath his scriptum est very ready and can tel them at what time soeuer a sinner doth repent him of his sinne he shall haue mercie and truly by his abusing of scripture he preuailes with many the wordes which the diuell alleageth are taken out of the fourescore and eleuenth psalme the eleuenth verse for he shall giue his angels charge ouer thee to keepe thee in all thy wayes ampc now the diuell in alleaging and propounding the words is very precise and sheweth himselfe very carefull in repeating of the words in so much as he will not leaue out no not this particle for which might well haue bene left out yet in the end he stickes not to leaue out a whole clause which is the maine point and ground of god promise namely this to keepe thee in all thy wayes where we may see how the diuell doth most vil ly abuse the scriptures of god and it is vsuall with him in his allegations to put in or to put out something or some way or other to depraue them or to corrupt the sense and meaning of the scriptures to serue his owne turne and as this is the diuels manner in his alleaging and dealing with the scriptures so do the papists as his scholers for though in word they hold the scriptures yet it is vsuall with them to put in or leaue out or by some meanes to corrupt and depraue the in the sense and meaning as might be shewed by example well seeing the diuell is so skilfull in the scriptures and can alleage them so readily and so fitly for his purpose and withall is so malicious to mince them and depraue them it should make all man to studie the holy scriptures that so we might be acquainted with them and be able to disclose and to descry satans fallations and subtilties and we should wish with moses that all the lord people could prophecie but especially the ministers of the word they must labour to be thorowly acquainted with the booke of god to obserue euen the circumstances of the text else the diuell will cast a mist before their eyes and beguile them with his subtill fallations and therefore they must do as ezechiel did eate vp the book of god and that we might not perceiue satans subtilties and deceit he labours to keepe man in ignorance of the word and by all meanes to haue the scriptures hid and darke and if it were possible to root out the schooles of learning and that the bible might be burned and as he preuailes in popery to bring man to this that all religion and the scriptures might hang on mens deuises and mans learning as they do in popery ground all vpon lumbard the maister of the sentences and barre the common people from the scriptures locking them vp in an vnknowne tong so with christians he taketh the like course for he perswades them that the scriptures are hard to be vnderstood and very obscure and troublesome and therfore he drawes man minds from the studie of them to reade the writings of man because they seeme to be more pleasant and delectable that so being not acquainted with the text might not descrie his deceipts and subtilties againe seeing the diuell can alleage the word of god and say it is written and that he can bring in scripture fit for his purpose what a shame is it for christians if they do not labor so to know the scriptures of god that they may alleage them as occasion shall serue amp that not as some do to heape place vpon place without all reason but to alleage them fitly and to the purpose lastly seeing this is a diuellish and satanicall practise in alleaging the scriptures to depraue and corrupt them to leaue out and put in at his pleasure it must warne vs that when we are lawfully called we do speake and vtter the words of other man euen all amp no more but all neither putting to them nor taking from the and that without changing their words or the sense and meaning of them he shall giue his angels charge ouer thee the true sense of the place is this that the lore had a speciall care of his people and when he sent any iudgement vpon the israelites he gaue them this comfortable promise that in the middest of all their troubles he himselfe would protect them and as this promise was made to them so it is generall to the whole church of god and belongs to vs for in all common iudgements and calamities the children of god which walke in his waies shal be sure to haue protection and securitie for the angels of god by his appointment do hold them vp as it were in their hands in which words there is a comparison taken from nurses who hauing children committed to their care do hold them very charily and tenderly in their hands and dare not let them go out of their armes euen so the angels of god by his appointment become euen as nurses to his children in all their lawful wayes and do attend vpo them and are very carefull to protect them from danger so long as they keepe themselues within the compasse of god word it is true indeed that iudgement begins at the house of god and he often afflicts his dearest children to trie their faith and patience yet is is most certaine that in commo calamities the children of god shall haue protection and security yes the angels of god as it were nurses shal hold them in their hands and defend them so long as they keepe themselues in the wayes of god and within the compasse of his will in his word but if they leaue the way of god commandements and wader in by paths and go out of their lawful callings they haue no assurace of god protection neither haue god angels any charge to watch ouer them seeing then god hath made so mercifull a promise of protection to all them that walke in his wayes and within the compasse of his commaundements it should warne vs all to beware how we go out of our wayes and lawful callings but that we studie the law of god and as we looke for his protection to keepe within the compasse of it iesus said vnto him it is written againe thou shalt not tempt the lord thy god in these words is cotained the answer of our sauiour christ to the second temptation of the diuell wherein he doth oppose scripture against scripture but to expound that place which the diuell alleaged and to shew how vilely satan abuseth the word of god he alleageth another place of scripture wherein our sauiour christ answers the diuell that it is true god hath made sundry promises in his word of protectio to his people but yet so as if they refuse to walke in the comandements of god and to vse such lawful meanes as he prescribeth in his word he is not bound to perfome them for they be made vpon that condition againe it is written seeing our sauior christ doth alleage another place of scripture to expound that the diuel brought against him and to shew how he abused scripture hence we gather that the holy scriptures are of themselues sufficient to interprete themselues for so christ alleageth another text of scripture to expound that which satan alleageth and to confute his abusing of it so we find that ezra did expound the law of god and giues the sense of it by the scriptures and so expounds the one by the other nehem iunius now if the servant of god could do this in the old testament how much more may we in the new wherein many things are most plainely opened and expounded by christ and his apostles but the papists cannot by any meanes yeeld to this doctrin for they hold that that which must interprete the scriptures must haue iudiciall power and authoritie to iudge of the sense of the scriptures but they hold the scriptures are but a dumbe letter and therefore are not able to iudge of the sense ad meaning of the scriptures yet for all that we see by the example of our sauior christ that the scriptures are of sufficient power to giue the sense of the scriptures to interprete theselues and to shew what is the true sense of the scriptures though they be dumbe and as we see that a ma may aswel shew his mind to his friend by letters and writing as by word of mouth euen so the lord god speakes now to his people by the scriptures as well as he did in olde time by his owne liuely voice from heauen but if the papists will yet deny the scriptures to haue power to iudge and determine of the sense of the scriptures then would i know who hath this power giuen vnto him they answer the church must giue iudgement and determine of the sense of the scriptures but that is false for the lord hath not giuen any such power to the church to determine of the sense of the scriptures at her pleasure but only he hath giuen to the ministery of the word to open and expound the scriptures by the scriptures theselues as a lawyer hath not that power to iudge of the law of his prince and to giue what sense he listeth but onely to expound the law and to giue the sense of it by the words of the law and other circumstances cocerning the same the church of rome say further they determine of the sense of the scriptures either by the rule of faith or the consent of the fathers or if they faile then the pope he is determine of them as one that cannot erre concerning the rule of faith by which they vnderstand vnwritten traditions how can they be fit iudges to determine of the sence of the scriptures vnlesse we will gi e more authoritie to vnwritten verities then to the written word of god nay onely the scriptures must be the rule of faith and only the scriptures iudge and determine of the sense of themselues neither is the consent of fathers a sufficient rule to giue iudgement and to determine of the sense of the scriptures for we know that they being man and many of the hauing not the knowledge of hebrew and greeke yes and most of all in expounding the word are subiect to error and sometimes do erre and by the same reason the pope is no meete man to be the iudge of the scriptures and to determine what should be the sense of the seeing he is subiect to manifold errors and many popes haue erred in the foundations of religion now follow the words of christs answer taken out of deut thou shalt not tempt the lord thy god first we must search what this word to tempt signifies secondly the maner how god is said to be tepted thirdly the cause and root of this tempting of god first to tempt god is to proue or to make trial whether god be such a one as the scriptures report him to be namely whether he be so iust so mercifull so mightie as the word of god describes him to be so the propet dauid expounds it psalm your fathers tempted me and proued me in the desert where to tempt is to proue god iustice and mercie whether he were so iust and mercifull as the word sets him out to be and as he promised to be secondly for the manner it is not simply to tempt and to make triall of god but to tempt god is to make needlesse triall of god power ampc when we haue no cause to try the lord and so it is taken here in the words of christ thou shalt not tempt that is thou shalt not take needlesse and vnnecessarie experience and triall of god power and goodnesse thirdly the cause which moueth man to tempt god is a distrustfull and vnbeleeuing heart eue want of faith so the israelites tepted god psalm ver they tempted god in their hearts and required meate for their lust and the reason is verse because they did not beleeue in god and did not trust in his helpe because they did not relye vpon his care and fatherly prouidece so that vnbeleefe was the roote of this their tempting of god so then to tempt god is to make needlesse and vnnecessarie triall and experience of his mercie goodnesse power and iustice proceeding from a distrusting heart now god may be tempted fiue maner of wayes first when man will take vpon them to appoint god the time when the place where and the maner how god must helpe them and accomplish his promise to them thus the israelites in the wildernes wanting water they say is the lord amongst it vs or no shewing that through the lord had promised he would be with them yet vnlesse he would at that time giue them water in their need they would not giue credit to his promise againe psalm though the lord had giuen them water yet they say can he giue bread also or prepare flesh for his people still shewing that vnlesse the lord would at their pleasures amp now presently send them meate they were readie to distrust his prouidence and therefore it must admonish vs that we must not in our requests and petitions as the bethulianes did appoint god the time place or meanes how we would be helped in pouertie sicknesse or other waies but cotinuing in prayer waite vpon the lord leysure and leaue these circumstances to his good will and pleasure secondly god is tempted when man will not beleeue his word but do demaund signes and wonders from heauen as the scribes and pharises did ioh tempt our sauiour christ not beleeuing his doctrine vnlesse he would confirme it by some miracle and thus all they tempt god who refuse to beleeue the doctrine of god because it is not confirmed vnto them at their pleasure by signes and wonders but some may say what is it not lawful the to demaund and require a signe at god hands yes we may sometimes and so we reade that gedeon did require a signe of god and sinned not so did hezechiah king in two cases man may aske a signe of the lord first when the lord giues a man commaundement to aske a signe then we may aske it lawfully and thus the lord bid achaz to ask a signe and he sinned in refusing to do it secondly a man may aske a signe of god when it is necessarie for the confirmation of a man in some extraordinarie calling as we see in gedeon being extraordinarily appointed of god to be the captaine and deliuerer of god people he being not fully perswaded of this his vocation desired a signe of god not of infidelitie but the better to resolue himselfe of god calling him to that busines and so it was in hezechiah to perswade himselfe of god extraordinarie deliuerance from an extraordinarie di ease the third way whereby man tempt god is when man liue in sinne continually without repentance and so will trie god mercie and thus the israelites tempted god number and so all those which liue in inne from day to day without repentance do indeed tempt god and abuse his patience mal and therefore seeing that this is euen to tempt god to liue in sinne without repentance it must stirre vs vp all to take heed how we runne on in sinne but that we do wi speed repent and breake off the course of our sins for so long as we liue in sinne without repentance we tempt god and then we can promise no safetie to our selues neither looke for the protection of god angels but ly euen naked to all god heauie iudgements the fourth manner of tempting god is to inioyne man the obseruations of the ceremoniall lawe as it appeareth ast the iewes are said to tempt god in that they vrged the obseruation of the ceremonies of moses and by this we may iudge of the present estate of the church of rome and of their religion which stands for the most part in vaine and superstitious ceremonies and that which is worse of iudaisme and gentilisme the last way how man tempt god is not to vse the lawful amp ordinarie means which god hath appointed either concerning mens soules or concerning their body and this is here vnderstood in this place when christ saith thou shalt not tempt the lord thy god when we shal refuse such lawful and ordinarie meanes as the lord hath appointed and vse extraordinarie euen as a man hauing a readie way ouer a bridge should leaue that and thrust himselfe into the water what were this but to tempt god or when a man hath the ordinarie way to come downe by the steppes or staires and refusing that shold cast himselfe downe from the top of a steeple so those man who contemne the word of god and will not vouchsafe to heare what do they else but euen tempt god seeing they refuse the preaching of the word which is the ordinarie meanes to saue mens soules and thus satan tempted our sauiour christ to tempt god for hauing now set him on the toppe of the temple in a dangerous place he perswades him to cast himselfe downe and he addeth that he may be bold to do so because god hath giuen his angels charge to looke vnto him that he take no harme but our sauiour christ answers him that were to tempt god seeing he had the lawful and ordinary way to go downe by the staires and therefore he had no reason to cast himselfe downe in a word all those tempt god which either refuse the ordinary meanes god hath appointed or do wilfully cast themselues into daunger being not called thereunto of god as peter hauing no calling of god went and thrust himselfe into caiphas hall to see what became of his maister amp the three worthies which ventured through the hoast of the philistims to fetch water at the well of bethell for dauid whereas he might haue had it without danger at home here some may aske what we are to iudge of those which vse to walke on ropes on high places and on the toppe of houses whether do such man sin or not ans these man do so either with a calling or without a calling such as do it by vertue of their lawful calling as mosons and such as build churches and houses and so by reason of their trade work on high places cannot be said to tempt god nay rather so long as they walke faithfully in their lawful callings they may assure themselues of god blessing and his protection but as for those who to shew their agilitie and to make sport walke on ropes or runne vpon the roofe of houses these man hauing no calling from god so to do they cannot looke for god protection nay they in so doing tempt god casting themselues vpon daunger and our sauiour christ might a thousand times better haue done this which satan wold haue him here to do yet would he not put himselfe into needlesse daunger lest he should tempt god much lesse ought any man else adventure to do it and in this that our sauiour christ vseth the ordinarie way euen the staires we may learne that if any man looke to haue god protection and blessing he must also make sure to vse the lawful and ordinarie meanes appointed of god amp keepe himselfe within the compasse of his calling yes if we desire to find comfort in any of god gracious promises we must be wary to keepe our selues within the compasse of his commaundements but if we leaue them then we find no true comfort neither haue we any promise of protection from god but so long as we walke in obedience of god commaundements and within the compasse of our callings we haue this blessed promise from god that his angels shall take the care of vs to guard and to defend vs againe the diuell taketh him into an exceeding high mountaine in the seuen verses going before we haue heard of the two first temptations of our sauior christ now followeth the third in this third temptation we are to consider againe three especial points first the preparation of the diuel ver secondly the temptatio it selfe ver thirdly christ his answer ver and first of all seeing the diuell doth thus arme himselfe and comes prepared three times in three seuerall temptations it should teach vs all on our parts to prepare our selues continually and to be ready to resist his temptations in the diuels preparation note two parts first he taketh him to an exceeding high monntaine secondly he shewes him all the kingdomes of the world and the glorie of them but how could the diuel cary our sauiour christ to this high mountaine i answer he might do it two wayes first by vision secondly by reall transporting of his body from ierusalem to this mountaine some thinke that this was onely in visio but i rather thinke our sauiour christ was caried locally and really for our sauiour christ his temptations are not imaginary but true and reall temptations and the words import no lesse but that he was really and locally transported from the citie to the mountaine the reasons why the diuell caried our sauiour christ to the mountaine are these first because the diuell in all things desire to imitate god and to become as it were god ape now we reade that the lord caried moses to the mount nebo to shew him all the land of canaan so the diuell to imitate god and by imitating god to match him and so to disgrace the lord carieth our sauior christ to the mountaine as it is likely to imitate god dealing with moses secondly the diuell caried our sauiour christ to this high mountaine as a most fit and conuenient place to broach this his third and last temptation now in hand in that the diuell doth carie our sauiour christ from ierusalem to this hill locally hence we learne that he may by god permission haue like power ouer the deare children of god not once but twise nay thrise amp oftentimes we see this true in our sauior christ the head therefore if the lord permit satan and by his permission giue the diuell libertie to transport our body from place to place we must not be discouraged seeing the same thing befell the head it may also befall his members which we are the second part of the diuels preparatio is this that he shewes him all the kingdomes of the world ampc now concerning this we may not think the diuell could do this in deed and truth to shew christ all the seuerall kingdomes of the world as they be here placed vpon earth for that is a thing impossible for there is no hill so high that a man might see them all nay if a ma were as high as the sun and could see neuer so clearely yet he could but see the one halfe of the earth and therefore we must know he shewed them in a counterfeit vision now these visions of the diuell they be either of the outward senses or else of the vnderstanding of the outward senses as the delusions of the diuel making man thinke they see that they do not see indeed so the diuel is said to shew samuel to saul in a vision in his proper habite and this was indeed but a couterfet samuel not that true samuel who rested in the graue concerning his bodie and remained in heauen concerning his soule secondly there be false visions and deludings of the vnderstanding as the lord speaketh that he will make the false prophets ashamed of their lying visions and some of these visions come vnto man sleeping called dreames deut some come waking as to such as haue their braine crased they oftentimes haue visions and thinke themselues to be kings or prophets as john baptist ampc now concerning this vision of christ offered by the diuell he did it not onely to the mind of christ but also to his out ward eye and visibly by this practise of the diuell we may behold his wonderfull skill and power in that he can resemble to the outward senses in such a strange manner euen as he listeth so great and wonderfull matters and the like is done by magicians and coniurers who by the helpe of the diuel can reueale and shew things done in a farre countrey or things that be lost in a glasse or for things long passed can resemble them to outward sense in a glasse or in the aire so that those are deceiued who are of mind that they cannot do this for if the diuell could shew christ all the kingdomes of the world and the glorie of them in so short a time then much more can he shew some one particular thing to the eye and sense of man now let vs marke the diuels drift in this temptation amp setting before christs eyes this goodly and glorious sight sure it was to this end that the diuell might by this meanes more easily wind himselfe into the heart of christ and therefore he sets this thing before his eyes that christ might be moued by them and take some delight in them and delighting in them might desire them and so satan might in the end ouercome him and insnare him and this hath bene the auncient practise of the diuell as genes first to moue evah to cast her eye vpon the apple to marke the beautie of it then to like it the to desire and lust after it and so in the end to tast of it and thus he dealt with christ first he shewes this glorious sight and the beautie of all these things that if he could he might haue moued him to desire them and so make his temptation take place seeing this is satans auncient subtiltie it must warne vs to take great heed of our outward senses especially the two senses of learning namely seeing and hearing the eyes and the ares be the two windowes of the soule and if the diuell can get in his head there he will easily wind in all his bodie and poison our soules we had need therefore to counterguard our hearts to keepe them with all diligence euen aboue al watch and ward and euermore to take heed who amp what enters into our eyes and eares and to make sure w keep carefull watch at those doores we mu pray with dauid o lord set a watch before my mouth and keepe the doore of my lippes and with holy iob make a couenant with our eyes that they behold no vanitie this if we do death shall not enter in by these doores and windowes but we shall preserue our soules in puritie now when the diuell shewes our sauiour christ this goodly shew let vs mark the maner he shewes christ all the beautie the glorie and delight of them not the troubles vexations calamities and daungers of them and thus will the diuel deale with vs if he would tempt any one to some sinne he neuer shewes but hides the miserie amp daunger the curses and calamities that will ensue vpo that sinne but he shewes the profit gaine pleasure delight and commoditie that that sinne will affoord them that by this meane he may bring them to his bow and moue them headlong to rush into the commiting of sinne indeed when he hath got his purpose and preuailed thus farre to bring a man into sin then he will lay it open in most vgly maner and lay before a poore sinner the horror and punishment due to his sinne that so he may make a poore sinner breake the necke of his soule in despaire further marke how the cunning diuell shewed not these goodly and glorious sights in the first or second temptation but reserued them for the last and that in great subtiltie for the diuell know very well that if any would peruaile then surely the desire of honor of preferment of profit and pleasure would moue the heart of christ and in this subtiltie he shewes that this is a most daungerous temptation which comes from the right hand that is which proceeds from profit pleasure preferment and honour and by this temptation he preuailed more against dauid then he could when he was in great conflict and persecuted by saule so prosperitie and ease in the primitiue church in the dayes of constantine did more preuaile with christians then persecution and tribulation could do for the space of three hundred yeares before and those which could be moued by no other meanes yet the hope of honor profite and pleasure hath ouercome and preuailed with them thus ease slayeth the foolish prosperitie is as a slipperie way and few hauing rest are edified and walk in the feare of the lord amp the comfort of the holy ghost act luke cap he addeth the circumstance of time that the diuell shewed all this to christ in a point or moment of time in so short a time as possibly might be with maruellous speed amp celeritie and this the diuell did being subtill the more to inflame th heart of christ to desire them and therefore he set his wares open and as it were in a glimpse gaue him the beholding of the beauty of the so we see if me see some st ag and beautifull thing and haue but a blush or a litle glimpse of it they desire it with mor eagernesse amp more greedily affect it eue so he would haue dealt with our sauiour christ he would haue affected his hea with this sudden and glorious spectacle now followeth the temptation it selfe in these words and said vnto him all these will i giue thee if thou wilt fall downe amp worship me in this temptation we must first marke the scope and drift of the diuell therein in the first temptation he laboured to tempt christ to distrust and vnbeleefe in the second to puffe him vp with vaine confidence and presumption now in this third he tempted christ to commit idolatry euen to worship the diuell and truly this hath euer bene the practise of the diuell to seeke to ouerturne religion and good conscience by these three things honour profite and pleasures among protestant and protestant ministers he hath preuailed much by these meanes when as for the ministers of the word many haue in hope of profit and preferment forsaken true religion amp cleane abiured it and taught the cleane contrarie euen that which the papists hold and teach so we see that protestant merchant for hope of gaine do carrie ouer to the church of rome all such merchandize of waxe ampc as the papistes vse to maintaine their superstitions and idolatry and among common professors many of them to saue their lands liuings and places haue chaunged as religion hath changed now papists now protestant like to camelions into any colour of this we had experience in queene maries dayes few great man remained protestant but yeeded to the idolatry of those times this third temptation hath two parts first a promise secondly a condition and here the diuell saith not i will procure thee these things at god hands but in his own name i will giue thee all these to make chrit depend vpon him for them to trust in him and to deny his confidence in god and to relie vpon the diuell for an inheritance in this world in which vile practise of the diuell we may behold his shamelesse boldnesse who dares offer christ the gift of all these conditionally if he would worship him whereas indeed they did all most properly belong to iesus christ himselfe and were his owne neither had satan any title to them but onely by vsurpation and as the diuel here with christ so he dealeth with most man of the world to tempt them to depend vpon him for the wealth of the world and to make the diuell their god for though me deny this in word and say all they haue god hath sent it they thanke god yet their wicked practises shew the contrarie that they do indeed depend vpon the diuell for gaine and profite seeing most man get their goods by false waight and measures by deceit fraud cousinage by lying swearing amp forswearing now while they get that they haue thus by such vile and wicked meanes it plainly shewes that all they haue they haue it of the diuell amp depend vpon him for wealth amp so make him their god though in word they deny it neuer so much secondly the diuell knew christ was a king and that his kingdome was not of this world but spirituall exercised especially in mens consciences now the diuel he labours to tempt christ to become an earthly king which if it had taken place in christ he knew then that he could not be that true messiah who should raigne spriritually in mens consciences and in like maner deales the diuell with the members of christ for the church of god hath a kingdome and that is spiritual in the word of god now the stewardship is the dispensation and ministery of the word preached and against this the diuell laboureth that it may become an earthly kingdome not spirituall but carnall not in the power of the spirit but in the carnall wisedome of mans eloquence and so by all means to ouerturne the true kingdome of christ thirdly we see here how the diuell maketh very large and liberall promises though he meant to performe nothing neither could he though he would this must teach vs to study that we may be contrary to the diuel and therefore that we do warily consider what promises we make whether the thing we promise be lawful and in our owne power and that we do it with sincere harts voide of deceit and with purpose to be as good as our word and when we haue promised accordingly to performe our promise for that is a marke of god children and a fruite of the spirit and true faith in doing the duties of equitie and in that the diuel shewed all these vnto christ euen the seuerall kingdomes of the world it is manifest he knew them all and was well acquainted and had trauelled through them as he confesseth ioh and in that he could shew the chiefest glory and beautie of them in such a short time it is cleare he was cunning in them and the seuerall estates and conditions of them all and we see that the diuel in propounding all these glorious kingdomes vn christ he did tempt him to ambition tha he would set his heart on them and so desir them and herein note one of his most principall practises which is the ouerturning kingdomes for the diuell desireth to do the greatest harme and most mischiefe that he can now in the ouerthrow of a kingdome many go to wracke and to effect this he seekes continually to puffe man vp with ambition that they may desire and gape for preferment and honor the lord hath in mercy placed ouer vs in this kingdome a gracious prince and a christian queene amp the diuell hath long enuied this our prosperitie and sought sundry by plots and manifold practises to ouerthrowe our state to cut off the head and to cast her crowne into the dust and to this purpose he hath raised vp many wicked and rebellious subiects but the lord hath in mercie brought all to nought and therefore the remembrance of this should moue vs all to thankfulnesse for this great mercie of god in defending both prince and people and bringing to nought all such rebellious wretches confounding those ambitious heads and all their vile and trecherous plots and deuices and we must shew this thankfulnesse in the duties of repentance and sincere obedience secondly this must teach vs to pray vnto god continually for the preseruation of our prince and kingdome that he would euermore confound and bring to nought all satans policies and vile plots and practises of ambitious heads and it is our duty in token of true ioy and thankfulnesse to do as the people did in the dayes of salomon who shouted so loud and cried out god saue king salomon that the very earth rang againe eue so should all true christians to expresse the ioy of our hearts pray day and night god saue queene elizabeth and herein is our comfort that though the diuell with all his malice seekes to destroy both prince and people and the whole kingdome and hath his wicked instruments to effect the same yet the lord god hath his angels which take care of his church and people and stand round about them to defend them both by sea and by land that all the diuels in hell cannot hurt them but the angels of god defend his children at home and beate back all our enemy from inuading of vs all these will i giue thee these words are the very words of the pope of rome who as satans vicar hath indeed the two hornes of the lambe but he speakes like the dragon he makes himselfe equall to god he can as he sayth send to heauen and to hel set vp and pul downe princes he can do what he list he can open and shut at his pleasure pardon sinnes and i know not what which shewes he speakes the diuels language the language of ashdod not of canaan luke the diuell ads a reason further to perswade christ for he saith all these kingdoms are mine and i ca giue them to whom i will where first the diuell tels a loud lie chalenging to himselfe the right of all the kingdomes of the world for it is the lord his right alone as we may see daniel where the lord speakes to that proud king n buchadnezar by the ministerie of daniel i beare rule ouer the kingdomes amp i alone sayth the lord god can giue them to whom i please so then the diuell hath no power to giue them neither hath any title to them that he can bestow them at his pleasure no that belongs to god alone yet we see satan will be an vsurper at large secondly marke the diuels arrogancie and shamelesse boasting in that he dares chalenge all the kingdomes of the earth to himselfe as though he were soueraigne lord of them to do with the at his pleasure and let vs all learne by this shamelesse lying and notorious boasting of the diuel to take heed that we be not like him in these sinnes but study to be contrary to him and therefore we must desire and study to speake the truth at all times and take heed of boasting yes rather let vs thinke as humbly and basely of our selues as possibly we can which is a good meanes to humble and cast downe our proud hearts and let such know that are giuen to these sins to lying and vaine boasting of this and that which they haue not it argues great pride and shewes they be very like the diuell himselfe in this point if thou wilt fall downe and worship me here is the second part of the temptation namely the condition and the maine drift of the diuell in these words is to bring our sauiour christ to manifest idolatry euen to worship the diuell himselfe first seeing the diuell durst be so bold to tempt our sauiour christ to idolatry and to worship himself hece we see that the maine scope of the diuel is especially to deface religion and the true seruice and worship of god and therefore he assaults the church of god and tempts man to bring them to embrace heresies schismes idolatry that he might destroy the church of god and thus he became a lying spirit in the mouth of foure hundred false prophets at one time and when iehosuah the high priest came into the temple to performe the worship of god he stood vp to hinder him when he was praying for the good of the church and so doth he in these dayes stand vp and seeke by all meanes to hinder god ministers in the building vp of god church when christ hath sowne good wheate the the diuell soweth tares and whe paul would haue gone to preach the gospell to the thessalonians the diuell hindred him and it is his speciall study to stop the ministery of the gospell and therefore it is said that the diuell cast many of god ministers into prison revelation reu there came euill and vncleane spirits out of the mouth of the beast which entred into kings houses to turne the from the entertaining of the gospell because that kings be either especiall nurses to the gospell or else if satan can preuaile with them become greatest enemy to hinder the course of the gospel such frogges be these seminarie priests monkes friers and popish iesuits which lurke commonly in kings courts and in the places of mighty man then seeing the diuell is so painefull to stop the course of the gospell to ouerturne true religion amp the seruice of god it must stirre vp all the ministers of the word of god to labour and take paines that their diligence in defending and vpholding true religion and building the church of god may counteruaile satans diligence in hindering of it secondly it behooueth all christians not onely to pray for themselues but seeing the diuell labours the ruine of the church specially in preuailing with princes and great man we must pray for the good of god church and children and euery member of it by name for kings amp queens ampc amp good reaso is there that we should do so for in the good and flourishing estate of the church we all receiue benefite by it and fare the better for it thirdly if satan durst set vpon the son of god and tempt him to idolatry and to worship the diuell then much more will he be tempting vs to the like sinne and set vpo sinfull man to moue him to worship him and make him his god but you will say there is none so mad to worship the diuell to make him our god oh we defie him true it is man say they defie the diuell and spit at him but alas if we consider their dealings we shall see the diuell sits in their hearts and rules there as god do but cast your eye vpon the three maine religions of the world the religion of the turke of the iew and of the papist and it will appeare that most man worship the diuell and make him their god because the turke he is ignorat of the true god the iew worships god the father but not by iesus christ whom they deny the papist worships a false and counterfeit christ forged by themselues and neuer read of in the word of god for they make him a sauior in part amp a priest to be creator or the maker of his creator that it may appeare that these three sorts of people do not worship the true god but euen the diuell himselfe let vs marke these principles first that al doctrines set downe and inuented by man concerning god seruice and worship being against the word of god they be the doctrines of diuels so saith paule tim that there shall come false teachers which shall teach doctrines of diuels and what are these verse he saith such as forbid to marrie and teach man that some meates be holy in themselues amp some vnholy and not lawful to be eaten the second principle is this all worship of god deuised by man being against the word of god is the doctrine of diuels so the gentiles offer to idols paule saith they offered to diuels yet none of them intended that but rather by the idols offered to god so whatsoeuer worship shall be inuented being against the word of god it is indeed the worship of the diuell not of god now by these two principles it appeareth that the worship of god performed by the turkes and by the iewes it is no worship of god but the worship of diuels seeing both of them worship the father out of the son and the worship of god in popery it is no better then the worship of the diuel seeing they worship god out of the true christ and haue forged to themselues a false counterfeit christ and if paule might truly affirme of the gentiles that they worshipped not the true god but offered to diuels then mnch more may it be auouched of that abominable sacrifice of the masse that it is indeed the worship of the diuell seeing it is more vile idolatry then that of the gentiles now it will be said though the diuell preuaile thus with them yet he cannot preuaile so with protestant neither can they be said to worship the diuell i answer that in truth there be thousands of protestant in the world who do worship the diuel for all those which do onely in outward shew professe true religion but in heart loue the world set their hearts vpon pleasures profites and preferments such professours do in truth make the diuell their god and may be said to worship the diuell for to whom soeuer they giue their hearts to them they do giue worship but while they set their hearts on these things they do not loue god neither do they beleeue in god and rest vpon him as their god and therefore they make the world their god and so worship the diuell fourthly by this practise of the diuell we see those man confuted who thinke that the diuell cannot make a league with man as with witches coniurers ampc for we reade and know such things haue bin done and here we haue a manifest proofe of it for the diuell offers a league to christ there was nothing wanting but our sauiour christ his cosent and if sinfull ma had bene in christs stead questionlesse there had bene a league and for so great gaine he would haue the diuell his seruice then said iesus vnto him auoide satan ampc now followeth the answer of our sauiour christ and first in christs answer marke in propounding of it he vseth first a speech of indignation and of defiance to the diuell and his offer auoide satan as though christ should haue said i haue heard thee blaspheme both me and my father amp haue thus long suffered thee but i will suffer thee no longer get thee hence satan i will not vouchsafe to answer to thy temptations any more marke here in the answer of christ that he was content to endure the diuels temptations and reproches which concerned his owne person but when he is so bold to blaspheme god his father he can endure him no longer now when he makes challenge and claimes title to all the kingdoms of the world as though he were lord of them and could bestow them at his pleasure therin he blasphemed god his father then this teacheth vs that if we shall heare vngodly wretches blaspheme the name of god we may not endure it but haue indignation amp great dislike of it and if we heare black mouthed rabshekahs blaspheme the holy name of god by swearing cursing banning we must be touched with griefe to heare the glorious name of our god dishonoured and if time and place require manifest our dislike in open reprehension of it whe ahab and iezabel being both wicked heard that naboth had blasphemed god they rent their cloathes in token of sorrow so when hezechiah heard the blasphemies of rabshekah he rent his cloths and was very much grieued for it whe dauid heard the gentiles say where is now their god this blasphemous speech did greatly affect him so as his very teares were his drinke and the bad speeches of the man of sodome did much affect lot amp vexe his righteous soule pet and as all man must be grieued to heare wicked man blaspheme the name of god so especially those that be gouernours of others and by name maisters of families as dauid saith psalm he would not suffer a talebearer in his house much lesse a blasphemer and the magistrate is especially bound to looke to this seeing it is the law of god that the blasphemer should be stoned to death now this law is perpetuall and if a man for speaking a word of disgrace against the person of the prince wittingly and willingly shall iustly lose his life then he that is a blasphemer and speakes to the disgrace of the eternall god is much more worthie to die a thousand death secondly by this answer of christ we learne how to behaue our selues when any shall go about to perswade vs to depart fro his church to renounce true religion we must accompt of them in that respect as the instruments of satan if the father should seeke to withdraw his owne child from the true religion the son must not spare the father but must cast the first stone at him deut and when peter would haue disswaded christ from going to ierusalem he saith get thee behind me satan though he was an excellent apostle yet in this christ accompts of him as of the very diuell againe in that christ bids satan now auoide and will dispute no longer with him we must hereby learne how to answer the diuell in his temptations though at the first when his temptations be more mild we may reply by the word of god yet when satan shall be more violent in his assaults we must imitate our sauior christ amp bid him auoide and dispute no more with him and whatsoeuer he shall bring against vs when we are not able to answer him yet let vs hold the maine conclusion in the word of god not vouchsa ing him an answer it is written seeing our sauior christ now the third time answers the diuell by the scriptures saying it is written we learne that the written word beleeued and vnderstood is the most sufficient weapon to confute amp to confound satan amp his vile teptations else christ wold not now eue the third time haue made choise of this weapon it is written againe this confutes the papists who make two scriptures one vnwritten and inward which is traditions the consent of the fathers which haue liued in all ages amp the other written in the holy scriptures now they do make their vnwritten scriptures as they call them and the consent of fathers to be of equall authoritie with the written word of god which our sauior christ doth shew here to be the most powerfull meanes to repell all satans temptations and the holy scriptures which they call a dead letter and make as though it had no power in it eue this alone is the sword of the spirit to confound satan and therefore damnable is that their doctrine which so abuseth the holy scriptures amp sets vp the erronious tradition of sinfull man for if the written word had bene but a dead letter our sauiour christ would neuer haue made choise of it abou all other weapons three seuerall times to confute satan euery time answering it is written secondly by this answer of christ saying it is written we learne how to behaue our selues when any shall seeke to turne vs from true religion to embrace false religion though we cannot answer their arguments but they set such a colour on them by their wit and eloquence and seeme to dazle our eyes that we can not see their deceits yet we must sticke to the scriptures and clea fast to the text of the bible and if we find but one sentence in al the bible to perswade vs of the truth of religion we must hang vpon it with both hands and let not o hold go nay it must be of more force amp credit with vs then a thousand arguments that tend to the contrary thou shalt worship the lord thy god only in these words is contained the answer of our sauiour christ to the third temptation of the diuell the words are take out of deut where they are read thus thou shalt feare the lord thy god and serue him now there may seeme to be some difference in the words as they be alleaged by christ for in that place of deuteronomy it is said thou shalt feare the lord thy god our sauiour christ saith thou shalt worship againe our sauiour christ addes a word which is not added by moses in that place namely thou shalt worship the lord thy god onely this word onely is not in that text of moses but if we vnderstand two points concerning the alleaging of scripture there will appeare to be no difference the first is this that christ and his apostles in their alleaging of scripture do not so much sticke to the very illables as aime at the sense of the scriptures which they alleage the second thing is this that our sauiour christ in alleaging scripture seekes to expound scripture and to open it in alleaging of it and so doing he may well adde a word when as the word he addeth maketh much for the meaning of the text and thus christ in this place chaungeth the word not mistaking of it but rather to expound moses for whereas moses saith thou shalt feare the lord he meaneth that religious feare whereby we feare god and worship him now our sauiour christ he saith thou shalt worship shewing moses meant that feare whereby we do with reuerence and bowing of the body and adoring of god worship him moued thereunto by religious feare either in praying for some mercy we want or giuing thankes for some benefite receiued againe christ in alleaging this text of scripture he addes a word yet so as he doth it without any fault for though this word alone be not in moses his text expresly set downe yet it is included and in sense it is vnderstood for where he saith in the thirteenth verse thou shalt feare the lord and ads no more in the fourteenth verse he saith thou shalt not walke after any other god so that a ma may easily perceiue he did in sese include it though not expresse it in words and thus we see our sauiour christ cleared in the text of scripture alleaged by christ note two points first what this worship and feare is secondly to whom worship is due first worship taken generally signifieth the giuing of honor and reuerence to another now this honour is either ciuill or diuine ciuill honour is that outward reuerence we giue to man by rostrating of the body or bowing of the knee and the end of this ciuill worship is that thereby we might acknowledge another to be our superiour amp therfore it is giuen of subiects to princes or of inferiours to those that by some meanes are their superiours and thus iacob worshipped that is gaue ciuil worship to esau seuen times genes this reuerence abraham gaue to the hittites gen amp lot to the angels bowed himselfe to the ground gen where he gaue them onely ciuill worship and honour so then it is manifest by these examples that we may lawfully bow and bend the knee and kneele to princes to giue the this ciuill honour thereby shewing we do acknowledge them to be placed aboue vs in authoritie and dignitie in the world by god the second kind of honour is diuine or religious worship when we giue such honor to another that thereby we do ascribe diuinitie amp diuine power vnto it acknowledging thereby that it is some diuine thing aboue all creatures and this we do first when we ascribe the godhead to it and make it god secondly when we ascribe god attributes to it as omnipotencie prouidence ampc thirdly whe we acknowledge it to be the creator and maker of all things fourthly when we acknowledge it to be the giuer of those good things we enioy and the defender of vs from euill this diuine worship is either inward in the heart or outward in the body inward diuine worship is whe a man giues his heart to any thing by beleeuing in it by louing of it and reioycing in it aboue all other creatures and that because it hath in it the god head or diuine nature or is god because it hath the attributes of god because it is the creator and defender of all things or else because it giues vs all good things and keepeth vs from all euill the outward diuine worship is when a man any wayes by prostrating himselfe and bowing of his body doth it to manifest his faith hope loue confidence feare or any gift in his hart thereby confessing it is his creator defender and preseruer so then here is a manifest difference betweene outward ciuill worship and that diuine worship which is outward because by that ciuill worship we do only acknowledge them to whome we do it to be our superious but by this outward diuine worship we do acknowledge that to which we do this worship to be god creator and defender of vs and all other things now in this place our sauior christ meaneth not that ciuill worship but he vnderstandeth outward diuine worship there is another seruice mentioned which is feare when we giue amp performe obedience to another it is either a seruice absolute or in part absolute when we obey the commandement of another simply without all exception when we obey another not onely outwardly in body but inwardly in soule will affections amp with the conscience and this is proper to god alone neither may this absolute obedience be giuen to any creature onely god alone is to haue this absolute worship so as we must obey him without all exceptions or question and that in body soule will affections and in the very conscience there is a second seruice which is only in part which we may giue to man as to the magistrate being in authoritie aboue vs vnder god for god hath giuen them leaue to make lawes and power to giue commandements and they must be obeyed in ciuill things yet with condition in the lord so long as their commandements stand amp agree with god commandements again they must be obeyed onely with our body their lawes cannot reach vnto mens hearts and consciences to bind them and of these two in this place we are to vnderstand that obedience which is absolute to obey the commandement of the lord absolutely and simply without condition or exception euen in all things whatsoeuer he commaunds vs following herein our father abraham who to performe obediece to the lord forsooke his natiue countrey amp was ready to offer his son his onely son his beloued son his son izak the son of the promise now followeth the person to whom this worship must be giuen this diuine worship whether outward or inward is due to god alone neither may it be giuen to any other creature though neuer so excellent and this is taught vs plainly by christ his answer and it is agreeable to the first and second commandements where we are forbidden expresly to giue this diuine and religious worship either to any creature or to idols but we must haue amp acknowledge iehouah to be our god alone revelation whe john was about to worship the angell and to giue him some part of this diuine worship he forbids him and tels him that he is but his fellow servant and chargeth john to worship god alone so then by this which hath bene said we see how fitly our sauiour christ answered the diuell amp alleaged this place of scripture to stop his mouth the diuell had shewed him all the kingdomes of the world and the glorie of them all and tels christ if so be he would but acknowledge him to be the giuer of them he would bestow them all vpo him now our sauiour christ answereth that he may not giue that honour to him which belongeth to god alone and to none else first we learne from this answer of christ that it is not lawful for vs to giue this diuine worship either inward or outward to any creature though neuer so excellent neither to angels nor saints because it is peculiar and proper to god alone and therfore if any ma shal prostrate his bodie before saints to pray vnto the he maketh them no lesse then god in giuing them that priuiledge which is proper to god namely to search the heart that they can heare our praiers that they be omnipotent omni present that is present in all places at once with all things which can be affirmed of none but god alone and yet this is the common practise of the papists to yeeld this diuine worship to saints and dead man and woman and to adore and worship them but the papists answer they do not worship saints with that worship which belongs to god neither do they worship the as god why no more would the diuell here haue christ so to do neither durst he presume to tempt christ to worship him as god but to acknowledge him to be the giuer of all the kingdomes of the earth and the diuell requires no more but outward worship and yet our sauior christ tels him that this outward worship which he demaunded was proper to god alone amp none may or ought to haue it saue he alone now the papists do giue that to saints which christ denyeth to the diuell for they auouch that saints can deliuer them from this disease and that disease they make them patrons not onely of priuate man but of whole kingdomes amp coutries as of italie s martin of spaine s iames of england s george ampc now to giue a kingdome which christ denied to satan is a lesse matter then to be a patron of a kingdome for one may giue a kingdome that cannot defend a kingdome nay in truth whatsoeuer they say they make the saints god for they pray vnto them they make them intercessors for them vnto god to procure them fauour in things concerning the life to come they call the virgin mary the queene of heauen they make christ to be her vnderling amp a punie for they pray her to commaund her son amp to cause him to heare their prayers which is to make her euen aboue god himselfe and therfore in truth they giue more to saints then the diuell required of christ againe they answer that which may be done to earthly princes may much more be done to saints in heauen now say they we kneele and bow to earthly princes and do reuerence to the chaire of estate why then may we not to saints but we answer them it is true we do kneele and bow vnto earthly princes but all this that we do we do it not so much to their persons as to that authoritie god hath laid vpon them and we do it onely to shew our subiection vnto the but to kneele to saints is no token of ciuill honour as this is which we giue to earthly princes but a part of diuine honour for by that they do acknowledge that the saints can heare their prayers search the hearts that they be omnipotent and present in euery place which honour is due to god alone yet though we may not thus adore saints as the papists do we do acknowledge a certaine honour due vnto them amp this honour stands in three things first by giuing thake to god for them in that the lord hath giu his church in former times such worthy instruments secondly by a reuerent estimation of them in that we accompt of them as the friends of god thirdly by honouring them though not with diuine worship yet by imitating their vertues and this is all that honour we owe vnto the saints departed now if that the adoring of saints be flat unlawful and forbidden then it is not lawful to appoint and dedicate solemne dayes vnto them to fast for them to worship the to worship their reliques all these be unlawful and yet common among the papists neither can the church of rome iustly accuse vs of the like though we haue and retaine the names of saints dayes in the church of england because we dedicate those dayes not to the worship of saints as they do but to the seruice and worship of god alone we must mark how our sauiour christ in alleaging and expounding of moses ioynes worship and feare together to shew that none can truly worship god but they that do truly feare god man commonly think they haue done enough if they come to church on dayes appointed listen a while to the word receiue the sacraments they thinke this is all the worship of god that he requires though they want the feare of god in their hearts but alas all this is to no purpose if man want the feare of god amp practise iniustice in their particular callings reade the first of isaiah verse the lord hates all the seruice and worship which the iewes offered him not simply because these things were unlawful in themselues for the lord had commaunded them but because they ioyned not not so much to their persons as to that authoritie god hath laid vpon them and we do it onely to shew our subiection vnto the but to kneele to saints is no token of ciuill honour as this is which we giue to earthly princes but a part of diuine honour for by that they do acknowledge that the saints can heare their prayers search the hearts that they be omnipotent and present in euery place which honour is due to god alone yet though we may not thus adore saints as the papists do we do acknowledge a certaine honour due vnto them amp this honour stands in three things first by giuing thakes to god for them in that the lord hath giue his church in former times such worthy instruments secondly by a reuerent estimation of them in that we accompt of them as the friends of god thirdly by honouring them though not with diuine worship yet by imitating their vertues and this is all that honour we owe vnto the saints departed now if that the adoring of saints be flat unlawful and forbidden then it is not lawful to appoint and dedicate solemne dayes vnto them to fast for them to worship the to worship their reliques all these be unlawful and yet common among the papists neither can the church of rome iustly accuse vs of the like though we haue and retaine the names of saints dayes in the church of england because we dedicate those dayes not to the worship of saints as they do but to the seruice and worship of god alone we must mark how our sauiour christ in alleaging and expounding of moses ioynes worship and feare together to shew that none can truly worship god but they that do truly feare god man commonly think they haue done enough if they come to church on dayes appointed listen a while to the word receiue the sacraments they thinke this is all the worship of god that he requires though they want the feare of god in their hearts but alas all this is to no purpose if man want the feare of god amp practise iniustice in their particular callings reade the first of isaiah verse the lord hates all the seruice and worship which the iewes offered him not simply because these things were unlawful in themselues for the lord had commaunded them but because they ioyned not to the seruice of god the feare of god but their hands were full of crueltie amp iniustice and they practised no mercie to man and whatsoeuer man professe in the worship of god and shew not the feare of god amp conscience in their particular callings and dealings with man all is but hypocrisie whereas we teach that a man may be certainely perswaded by faith of his election and saluation the papists say we cannot proue it out of the word of god now what though we cannot find this sentence in so many words i am elected yet as our sauiour christ by alleaging scripture gathered the sense of it so may we without blame gather that out of the word which is the same in sense which we hold in this point we see it is our dutie not only to worship god with outward worship of the bodie but with inward worship in the soule mind will affections and in the conscience paul he preached the gospell of god vnto the the corinthians to bring their very thoughts into subiection that is so to order them that they might not thinke any thing but that which was holy and according to the will of god then the diuell left him ampc in this verse is set downe the third and last part of the conflicts of christ with the diuell namely the issue and euent of them which is that glorious victorie and conquest which our sauiour iesus christ got against the diuell and this is the most principall part of all the rest for what comfort could we haue had in christs temptations in the preparation in the conflicts amp seuerall temptations vnlesse christ had vanquished satan and got the victorie nay all the comfort of god children stands in this victorie of our lord and sauiour iesus christ because now christ stood in our stead and was tempted for our sakes so that he being our head and getting victorie ouer the diuel the church amp euery member of the church in iesus christ got victorie ouer satan in the victorie we are to obserue two things first that the diuell departed from him secondly the angels ministred vnto him in this departing of the diuell from christ we may behold the vnspeakable goodnesse of god to his church for that which befell christ befalleth the church of god now the diuell hauing tempted christ in three seuerall and sore temptations he encountred him in all three and resisted the diuell in all his temptations and then the diuell leaueth him and goeth his way wherein we see the endlesse loue of god in that he puts an end to the afflictions of his church though they be many and sore yet they shall last but a time and haue an end so the lord speaketh of salomon if he sinne i will chastise him with the rods of man and with the plagues of the children of man such as should not be too extreame but that he should be able to beare so the prophet habacuck he in the first chapter breaketh out into impatient speeches for the afflictions of the church but chap verse the lord bids him waite and tels him it shall be amended and that he will put an end to their miseries the lord hath promised that he will not suffer his children to be tempted aboue that they shall be able to beare but shall find a blessed issue of their temptations the two prophets which were slaine for doing their message and for the testimonie of iesus lay vnburied three dayes and an halfe but after the lord puts into them the spirit of life againe and they reuiued and stood vp before the lord and they that saw them shall be afraid and see them ascend vp into heauen so that we may see the lord in mercie puts an end to all the afflictions of his children and this we may see by dayly experience some of god children are visited with grieuous and fearefull temptations some halfe a yeare some a whole yeare some two three foure ten yeares yet at length the lord giues them a good issue and puts an end to their miserie and in stead of horror of conscience sends them comfort amp in stead of griefe ioy vnspeakable and though the lord should suffer them to be tempted all their life long til their dying day yet then the lord would giue them a blessed issue of all their miseries and fill their soules with exceeding comfort here we see a notable differece betweene the first adam and the second adam the first adam was tempted and yeelded to satans temptations and suffered the diuell to enter into his hart the second adam iesus christ he was likewise tempted yet he yeelded not to the least assault of the diuell neither could he euer enter into his holy heart but departeth from him and is faine to leaue him in this departure of the diuell from christ first marke when he departed secondly for how long he departed for the first then the diuell left him that is after the three temptations were ended and christ had in great indignation bid him auoide satan for his blasphemous speeches then the diuell departed here we see the best way to put the diuell to flight and to giue him the repulse namely to resist him at the first amp giue him no ground but as s iames saith resist the diuell and he will flie from thee when as we depend on god word and the blessed promises of the gospell praying for grace from god to resist satan he shal neuer preuaile against vs but will depart and therefore it is but foolishnesse to thinke or imagine that he can be put to flight by musick merry company sports and pastimes or such like vanities but the onely meanes to cause him to depart is the word and prayer by them alone he is resisted they take a bad course who thinke they may yeeld to satans temptations when they are yong and purpose in their old age to resist him but if we euer yeeld vnto him we do set open the doore of our hearts vnto the diuel we do willingly receiue him and bid him welcom and then he will not easily be driuen away nay we shal find it a hard matter if not impossible to put him to flight in our old age but as man in a dropsie the more they drinke the more they desire so the more man yeeld to his temptations the more violently will he set vpon them after that our sauiour christ saith vnto him auoide satan presently he departeth and is obedient to his commaundement what was this any vertue in the diuel to obey christs commandement no surely it was no vertue in the diuell for we are to vnderstand there be two kinds of obedience one is voluntary and chearfull the other by constraint and forced voluntary obedience is that when any of the creatures of god do willingly through god grace mouing them obey the commaundement of god as all the good angels of god and adam before his fall and all the children of god that be effectually called iustified and sanctified do willingly and with chearfulnesse yeeld obedience vnto god in part besides this there is a constrained obedience when one is vrged and compelled whether he will or not to obey another as one that is a malefactor being condemned to die he is obedient and yeeldeth himself to death he submitteth him selfe because he must neither will nor choose so the diuell here obeyeth the voice of christ and departeth at his commaundement but this obedience in him is no vertue because he was compelled to do it and could do none otherwise and that which here befell the diuel shall befall all wicked amp impenitent sinners if they will not now obey the commandement of christ to repent and beleeue the gospell they shall one day in spite of their teeth be constrained will they nil they to obey that commandement at the last day of iudgement depart ye cursed into euerlasting fire prepared for the diuell and his angels the consideratio of this one point should all man now in the time of grace to yeeld hearty and willing obedience to the voice of christ in repenting and turning to god le one day we be constrained to yeeld to our eternall confusion luke he saith when the diuel ended all the temptation then he departed vvhere we may note that before the diuel left our sauiour christ he imployed all might skill subtiltie and fraud in tempti of christ and from this malicious pract of the diuell we may gather that christ was tempted with no smal and easie temptation but that he was tempted in the highest degree that could be for the diuell made an end of his temptations before he left him and had his will in tempting of him and therefore no question in these three maine temptations that we haue spoken of he tepted him as much as he could and shewed his greatest extremitie and fraud and this may appeare in that the angels were faine to come amp comfort our sauiour christ so that he was not tempted with some light and ordinarie temptations but in most extreame manner so as his heart within him was in perplexitie anguish and griefe yet without all sinne and this may minister comfort to the children of god if any man be tempted with some grieuous temptation in some wondrous and fearefull maner that he is almost at the point of despaire yet let him stay himselfe and let him not thinke that therefore he is cast away for here we see that iesus christ the son of god was tempted in the highest degree that might be and therefore the dearest servant of god may be extreamly tempted we must learne from hence to suspend our iudgements and if we see any so fearfully tempted amp their temptations so extreme and grieuous that they say of them selues that they be cast awayes or that while they yet liue they are already in hel let vs take heed we be not too rash in condemning of them neither let vs speake or thinke of them as cast awayes for our sauiour christ was tempted in the highest measure that could be and why the may not these kind of temptations befall the dearest children of god therefore that which is written of francis spira that he was a reprobate amp a cast away was penned very inconsiderately though he affirmed the same of himself for there did nothing befall him which may not befall a child of god for we see that our sauiour christ himselfe was tempted in the greatest measure that might be and we haue dayly experience from time to time that some of the deare children of god haue bene in like sort assaulted to despaire for a time to thinke themselues reprobates and cast awayes yet it hath pleased the lord in time to restore them to the feeling of his loue and they haue continued the faithfull servant of god till their dying day and as it is said the diuel departed as soone as he had ended all his temptations we may gather that these three wherewith he assaulted our sauiour christ they be the most principall temptations of the diuell amp the very ground of all other his temptations and therefore it shall be good for vs to learne to know them and the daunger of them that we may arme our selues by the example of christ against them especially the second circumstance to be marked in the diuels departure is that which s luke addeth though it be not expressed in mathew namely that the diuell left christ but for a season but we neuer reade that the diuell did tempt our sauiour christ after this but once vpon the crosse then indeed the diuell and all his angels set vpon him coloss i answer the diuell tempts either by himselfe or else by wicked man it is true indeed we reade not that the diuell did euer tempt christ after his departure from him but once when he was on the crosse but he set wicked man a work in persecuting of him continually so he tempted euah but once by himselfe but no doubt he tepted her after many times by other means secondly the diuell tempts by his instruments namely by wicked and vngodly me and thus he tempted adam not by himselfe but by euah so he tempted iob not onely by himselfe in casting the house vpon his children but also by his vile instruments the sabeans and caldeans whom he set a work to rob and spoile him and after by his mistaking friends so though we reade not that the diuell did tempt christ all his life time after this by himselfe yet did he it by his instruments as the scribes and pharises the cruell iewes yes by herod pontius pilate annas and caiphas and the rest he neuer ceased tempting of him after this and these temptations by his vile instruments were very great and grieuous vnto his sacred soule seeing the diuell tooke this course to tempt christ and then to depart for a while and after to returne againe we may see what is the estate of god church in this world namely that the church of god vpon earth is in a continuall intercourse of afflictions now afflicted after the lord giues it peace for a time and then the lord sendeth afflictions againe and as winter followeth sommer so doth ioy afflictions this being the estate of the church of god vpon earth a continuall intercourse of afflictions we must then learne what is our own particular estate while we liue in the church namely a state that is in a continuall intercourse of troubles and afflictions if we now inioy peace and rest we must make account it cannot alwaies indure but there must come a change and therefore we must beware in time of peace to prepare our selues against the time of affliction and of triall and perswade our selues the sun will not alwaies shine but this state will change and triall will come it followeth and behold the angels came and ministred vnto him here is now the second part of the victorie when as our sauiour christ had foiled the diuell and put him to flight then the angels come and minister vnto him to comfort him after this tedious combat behold this word is a word of wonder and it sheweth there is some matter of moment that followeth and what is that the wonder is that that person whom the diuell despised and would haue troden vnder his feete euen this person is here attended vpon by the good angels of god who are readie to offer him their seruice and come to comfort him in this ministerie of these angels consider first the bond which caused them to attend on christ secondly the number how many they were thirdly the time when they came to him first the bond which maketh these glorious angels and heauenly spirits to attend and waite vpon our sauiour christ is this that the man christ not the manhood of christ but christ god and man is lord of all creatures euen of the angels in heauen and the manhood of christ though it be not lord of angels yet it is farre more excellent then any creature whatsoeuer yes then the blessed angels and here we may behold the great goodnesse of god who hath exalted mans nature which was most vile by reason of sinne to be farre more excellent then any angell in heauen as it is ioyned to the godhead in the person of christ so then the angels minister to christ not as simply man but as god man or god and man and so they minister to all the true members of christ iesus which are truly coupled and vnited vnto his mysticall bodie christ is that ladder of iacob whereby the angels of god do ascend and descend to do seruice to all those which are truly ioyned vnto iesus christ gen this ought to make vs all admire the endlesse and vnspeakeable goodnes of god who hath not onely giuen vs to be lord of heauen and earth by the meanes of christ but euen the glorious angels which are farre aboue man in excellencie to be our servant to minister vnto vs to comfort and defend vs this should moue vs all to carrie and behaue our selues reuerently and holily in all our actions and speeches seeing the glorious and blessed angels of god do waite and attend vpon vs truly this ought to make vs haue great regard that no vnseemely speech or action passe from vs seeing we be in the presence of these most excellent creatures of god the blessed amp holy angels to behaue our selues with greater reuerence then we would before an earthly prince and in the presence of a mightie monarch the number of them it is not said there came one angell as in the garden but the angels came vnto him shewing there were mo then one and we find in the word that our sauiour christ had sometimes one somtimes mo to attend vpon him and so the wicked angels come sometimes one alone as here in christs temptations sometimes many as when christ was on the crosse colossians and so it is likewise with the good angels of god sometimes they come one alone sometimes moe together mow if this be true then that opinion fa leth to the ground which holds that euery man hath his two angels an euill angel to tempt him and his good angell to defend him but if god so please he hath a legion of bad angels to torment the bad and ten thousands of good angels to comfort the good the third point is the time when the angels came vnto christ then when the diuell had now ended all his temptations not in the time of the temptations whi christ was tempted but immediatly after they were ended true it is the good angels of god be waies readie to attend vpo christ amp to ob his will yet here it is said they came not our sauiour till after his temptations then when he had most need they are of god to comfort him and as it is like they tooke vpon them some bodily sh the time as the diuell did that so they ght the better do him seruice and here in the person of our sauiour christ we may obserue the dealing of god ith his children euen as he dealt with christ himselfe namely that the lord doth sometime conceale his fauour and not hew his accustomed mercie to his children least the comfortable sense and feeling of for a time to trie his children as here the lord with held for a time the comfort of his angels from our sauiour christ yet after in is greatest need sent them to comfort him o the lord dealeth with his children euen a nurse dealeth with her child setteth it owne and goeth and hideth her selfe for time letteth it sit still so as the child ta eth a knocke and it may be hurteth it selfe so as it bleedeth againe now all this she doth not because she loueth not her child that when she taketh vp her child againe into her armes it may loue her better and cling faster vnto her euen so dea eth the lord with his children he often withdraweth the comfortable feeling of his mercie and doth as it were hide himselfe for a time that so we may the better what we are without his mercie and make more accompt of it when the lo doth giue vs the feeling of it againe and we may loue him euer after more earne and more constantly to conclude most man will say there no need of this doctrine of temptations they neuer felt any such matter nor are acquainted with them nay they hope th say neuer to feele any such temptations they thank god that they neuer knew temptations meant indeed these po soules may thinke themselues happie they be in a most pitifull case and a mise ble estate for whosoeuer belongs to ch he must be made in some measure con mable and if they be the true member christ they must be made sutable to th head in suffering temptations nay it is ioy and we haue iust cause of reioyci when we be tempted especially if we able by the power of christ to resist temptations as he did so saith the ghost iam my brother saith apostle accompt it exceeding ioy when ye into diverse temptations and those man which say they neuer tempted all their liues alas they haue a full iudgement of god vpon them dnesse of heart which makes them that feele no temptations though they be yly tempted by the diuell to a thousand and impieties as the disciples of christ though they saw the miracle of christ saw that the bread was multiplied in eir hands yet vnderstood it not because the hardnesse of their hearts so these blind les though satan tempt them from day day yet they be so blinded amp their hearts hardned that they perceiue no such mat but if these man would learne once by the ord of god to see and feele their miserie nd so repent and be truly humbled for their and become new creatures they would be of another mind and therefore let such man pray to god that he of his mer le giue them the sight of their wofull mise le that he would giue them soft and tender earts to be humbled for their sinnes that so ey may feele the want of grace and they il then confesse it is not an vnneedful thing or them to know and vndergo temptations and that vnlesse they be tempted with christ they can haue no true ioy nor sound comfort in christ oalmightie lord god most merci and louing father in iesus christ are here assembled before thy glorious mijestie to be partakers of thy heauenly wor which of thine infinite goodnesse and mer thou hast ordained to be the ordinary me to worke our saluation we beg th therefore most mercifull father to blesse uery one of vs in the hearing and the sp king of thy holy word good lord op our blind eyes that we may be able to vnderstand it and whereas our hearts are of hardnesse full of sinne full of manifo rebellions good lord soften our hard ha graunt that thy holy word may be the tw edged sword of the spirit to cut downe sin and corruption in vs and make vs new tures in iesus christ and whereas we troubled with many impediments in h ring of thy word as wandring imagination in our hearts suggestions of satan and the dulnesse of our owne flesh good lord remoue these impediments and giue vs eue ne grace to heare thy word in feare and uerence as in thy presence and to receiue the same not as from man but as from iesus christ and when we haue heard thy word graunt that it may be not the sauor of death to our deeper condemnation but the sauor of life to our eternall comfort and saluation for this cause write the same in euery one of our hearts and tranforme vs into the obedience of the same in our life and conuersation and because satan is a deadly enemie to the ministerie of thy word good lord confound satan dissolue in euery one of vs the cursed workes of the diuel worke thine owne good works shew thy selfe more merciful in blessing of thy word then satan is or can be malicious in hindring of the same heare vs we beg thee in these requests and graunt these graces to euery one of vs not for our owne merits for vnto vs belongeth nothing but eternall shame and confusion for our sinnes but for the merites of thy deare son iesus christ in whom thou article well pleased to whom with thee and the holy ghost be giuen of euery one of vs all praise honor and glory both now and for euermore amen the voice of a person carnall of euill i do it and will do good i do it not nor will do regenerate of euill i do it but would not do it good i do not that i would glorified of euill i do it not neither i do it good i do it and will do it right honorable in the former is the combat of christ in this latter is set downe the combat of a christian he that fought with our head will fight with the members and he that assaulted christ will assaile all christians but christ did beare troubles and was borne out of them we must haue troubles and shall be borne out of them if our afflictions were plagues as to the egyptians curses as to cham destruction as to sodome desolation as to israel then had we cause to flie from them as moses did from that miraculous serpent but since they are but the trials of faith corrections of a father visitations from the bishop of our soules since they are as phlebotomie to a pleurisie and a purgation to a plethora they are to be endured with all patience how christ did endure them you may reade in that treatise how a christian must you may see in this the former treatise i presented to your honorable brother this latter to you most honorable sisters i desired to annex this to the former discourse because it is sutable to that present argument and i know not to whom i may better present it then to you who haue experience of this christian warfare if it please you but to reade these holy meditations and to entertaine this poore mite into your rich treasury by the reading i doubt not but you shal haue much comfort and by your entertaining the church shal haue much good now that good god who hath giuen your mind to know him giue you also an heart to lo him and as you are honorable in the eyes of this world so he make you most honorable in the eyes of his maiestie and thus crauing pardon i commit you to the grace of that god who will honor them that loue him and comfort them that seeke comfort from him sir i heard you with much comfort when you preached vpon the temptations of christ i pray you instruct me concerning the temptations of a christian and giue me leaue to aske you certaine questic s say on what is it which we call christi warfare christian warfare is concerning the right way of fighting in the spirituall battel which be the parts thereof the parts thereof are the preparation to battell and the combat it selfe how may i prepare my self vnto it to the preparation you must vse the complete armor of god ephesians for this cause take vnto you the whole armour of god that ye may be able to resist in the euill day and hauing finished all things stand fast how many parts hath this armor the parts thereof are especially six truth iustice euangelicall obedience faith the word of god continuall and feruent prayer with watching as you may reade ephesians stand fast therefore your loynes girded about with veritie and hauing o the brest plate of righteousnesse and your feet shod with the preparation of the gospell of peace aboue all take the shield of faith wherewith ye may quench all the fierie darts of the wicked and take the helmet of saluation and the sword of the spirit which is the word of god and pray alwayes with all maner of prayer and supplication in the spirit and watch thereunto with al perseuerance and supplication for all saints pet be sober and watch for your aduersarie the diuel as a roring lion walketh about seeking whom he may deuoure what then is the combat the combat is a mutuall conflict of them that fight spiritually who are the warriors the warriors are the tempter and the christian souldier ephesian for we wrastle not against flesh and bloud but against principality against powers and against the worldly gouernors the princes of the darknesse of this world against spirituall wickednesses which are in high places whom call you the tempter the tempter is the prince or his helpers the prince is satan and his angels which are spirituall wickednesses in high things his helpers are the flesh and the world what is the conflict of these warriors the conflict of all these is temptation whereby a man is prouoked to commit such wickednesse as is hurtfull to the saluation of his soule pet dearely beloued i beg you as strangers and pilgrimes abstaine from fleshly lustes which fight against the soule what must i note in this christian souldier in the souldier two things are to be considered his resisting and his fall vvhat is his resistance resistance is an action whereby the souldier doth withstand temptation through grace working inwardly in him john i write vnto you babes because ye haue knowne the father i haue written to you fathers because ye haue knowne him that is from the beginning i haue written to you yong man because ye are strong and the word of god abideth in you and ye haue ouercome the wicked pet ephesian psalm thou shalt walk vpon the lion and asp the yong lion and the dragon shalt thou tread vnder feete how is this resistance confirmed to confirme this these preseruatiues which follow are very necessary when you are tempted to sinne do not only abstaine from it but earnestly loue and follow after the contrary john neuer yeeld or consent to satans words whether he speake the truth accuse falsly or flat dissemblingly john ye are of your father the diuell and the lusts of your father ye will do he hath bin a murder from the beginning and abode not in the truth because there is no truth in him when he speaketh a lie then speaketh he of his owne for he is a lier and the father thereof marke and cried with a loud voice and said what haue i to do with thee iesus the son of the most high god and iesus said hold thy peace and come out of him act she followed paul and vs and cried saying these man are the servant of the most high god which shew vnto vs the way of saluation ampc august sermon one temptation is to be looked for after another and then especially when our enemie after he hath set his snares is at rest for the diuel neuer maketh an end of his malice pet i haue heard how to resist teach me i pray you what is his fall the fall is whereby the souldier through infirmitie fainteth being subdued by the power of the enemie gal brethre if a man be fallen by occasion into any fault ye which are spirituall restore such a one with the spirit of meeknesse considering thy selfe least thou also be tempted if i fall how may i rise to this appertaineth the spirituall remedie now a remedie is a thing hauing aptnesse to restore him which is fallen to his former estate gal and here two things must alwayes be thought on if there be a willing mind euery one is accepted for that grace which he hath not for that which he hath not corint for if there be first a willing mind it is accepted according to that a man hath and not according to that he hath not in all these things whosoeuer wil leade a godly life in christ the power of god is to be made perfect through their infirmitie corinthian and he said vnto me my grace is sufficient for thee for my power is made perfect through weaknesse very gladly therefore will i reioyce rather in mine infirmities that the power of god may dwell in me therefore i take pleasure in infirmities in reproches in necessities in persecutions in anguish for christs sake for when i am weake then am i strong but since satan is mine aduersarie instruct me how many his assaults be assaults are three fold vvhich is the first the first is about the christian mans effectuall calling and the temptation is the enterprise of the diuell to blindfold mans mind and to harden his hart lest the word of god should work in him to saluation mat and as he sowed some fell by the way side and the fowles came and deuoured them vp and some fell vpon stonie ground where they had no much earth and anon they sprang vp because they had no depth of earth and when the sun rose vp they were parched amp for lack of rooting withered away and some fell among thornes and the thornes sprung vp and choked them whensoeuer a man heareth the word of the kingdome and vnderstandeth it not the euill one cometh and catcheth away that which was sowne in his heart and this is he which hath receiued the seed by the way side how may i resist this assault a resistance in those that are called is wrought by the spirit of god that causeth man to lend their eares to heare and doth ingraffe the word in their hearts that the immortall seed of regeneration may spring in them psalm ioh act iam wherefore lay apart all filthinesse and superfluitie of maliciousnes and receiue with meeknes the word that is graffed in you which is able to saue your soules pet seeing your soules are purified in obeying the truth through the spirit to loue brotherly without faining loue one another with a pure heart feruently ioh whosoeuer is borne of god sinneth not for his seed remaineth in him neither ca he sin because he is borne of god a resistance in those that are to be called is when in a sincere heart they do ioyne the word which they haue heard with faith luke but that which fell in good ground are they which with an honest and good heart heare the word and keepe it and bring forth fruit with patience heb what certaine preseruatiues are to be noted in this resistance premeditation of the power and vse of the word ecclesiastes take heed to thy feete when thou entrest into the house of the lord and be more neare to heare then to giue the sacrifice of fooles for they know not that they do evil cha be not rash with thy mouth n let thine heart be hastie to vtter a thing before god for god is in the heauen and thou article the earth therefore let thy words be few diligent attentio of the mind act an hungring desire of the heart ioh now in the last and great day of the feast iesus stood and cried saying if any man thirst let him come to me and drinke integritie of life psalm the casting away of euill affections iam and be ye doers of the word and n hearers onely deceiuing your owne soules the inward consent and agreement of the heart with the word preached act an hiding of the word in the heart lest we should sinne psalm i haue hid thy word in mine heart that i might not sinne against thee a trembling at the presence of god in the assembly of the church isaiah for all these things hath mine hand made and all these things haue bene saith the lord and to him will i looke euen to him that is poore and of a contrite spirit and trembleth at my words act then sent i for thee immediatly and thou hast well done to come now therefore are we all here present before god to heare all things that are commaunded thee of god the god of power preserue me from this assault by these preseruatiues but how may i fall in this temptation your fall is either by a coldnesse in receiuing the word and a neglect therof or else by falling into errors what then must be my remedy the remedie for this is subiection which must be made to the iudgement and censure of the brother and ministers revelation i know thy workes that thou article neither cold nor hote i would thou werest cold or hote gal tim of whom is hymeneus and alexander whom i haue deliuered vnto satan that they might learne not to blaspheme what is the second assault the second assault is concerning faith how may one be thus assaulted by an illusion which the diuell casteth into the hearts of godly ones as when he saith thou article not of the number of the elect thou article not iustified thou hast no faith thou must certainely be condemned for thy sinnes as mat then came to him the tempter and said if thou be the son of god command that these stones be made bread now as he dealt with christ so will he with christians what helpes doth the diuell abuse for the strengthening of such illusions as these he abuseth aduersitie as dangers losses persecutions iealousie grieuous offences ampc so in dauid psalm loe these are the wicked yet prosper they alway and increase in riches certainely i haue cleansed mine heart in vaine and washed mine hands in innocencie in iob how many article mine iniquities and sinnes shew me my rebellion and my sinne wherefore hidest thou thy face and takest me for thine enemie will thou breake a leafe driuen to and fro and wilt thou pursue the drie stubble the remembrance of sinnes past iob for thou writest bitter things against me and makest me to possesse the iniquities of my youth a feeling of death euen alreadie at hand how may i withstand these by a true faith applying christ with all his merits particularly after this manner i assuredly beleeue that i shall not be condemned but that i am elected and iustified in christ and am out of all doubt that all my sinnes are pardoned isaiah he shall see the trauell of his soule and shall be satisfied by his knowledge shall my righteous servant iustifie many for he shall beare their iniquities rom for i am perswaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principality nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor heighth nor depth nor any other creature shall be able to separate vs from the loue of god which is in christ iesus our lord giue me a preseruatiue that i may resist your best preseruatiue is in temptation not to behold faith but the obiect of faith which is christ so did paul philip not as though i had alreadie attained vnto it either were alreadie perfect but i follow that i may comprehend that for whose sak also i am comprehended of christ iesus one thing i do i forget that which is behind and indeuour my selfe to that which is before and follow hard toward the marke for the price of the high calling of god in christ iesus so must all ioh and as moses lift vp the serpent in the wildernesse so must the son of man be lift vp that he that beleeueth in him should not perish but haue life euerlasting what is my falling in this assault your falling is doubtfulnesse and distrust of your election amp of god mercie psalm i called to remembrance my so in the night i com ned with mine own heart and my spirit searched diligently will in lord absent himselfe for euer and will he shew no more fauour is his cleane gone for euer doth his promise faile for euermore so dauid of himselfe saith psalm my god my god why hast thou forsaken me and article so farre from my health and from the words of my roaring what is my remedie the remedie is double first the operation of the holy spirit stirring vp faith and increasing the same philip i am perswaded of this same thing that he that hath begunne this good worke in you will performe it vntill the day of iesus christ luke and the apostles said vnto the lord increase our faith the second is an holy meditation which is manifold that it is the commandement of god that we should beleeue in christ ioh this is then his commaundement that we beleeue in the name of his son iesus christ and loue one another as he gaue commaundement that the euangelicall promises are indefinite and do exclude no man vnlesse peraduenture any man do exclude himselfe isaiah ho euery one that thirsteth come ye to the water and ye that haue no siluer come buy and eate come i say buy wine and milke without siluer and without money mat come vnto me all ye that are wearie and laden and i will ease you ioh that whosoeuer beleeueth in him should not perish but haue eternall life also the sacraments of baptisme and the lord supper do to euery one seuerally apply indefinite promises and therefore are very effectuall to enforce particular assurance or plerophorie of forgiuenesse of sinnes that doubtfulnesse and despaire are most grieuous sinnes that contrarie to hope man must vnder hope beleeue with abraham rom which abraham aboue hope beleeued vnder hope that he should be the father of many nation according to that which was spoken to him so shall thy seed be that the mercie of god and the merit of christs obedience being both god and man are infinite isaiah for the mountaines shall remoue and the hils shall fall downe but my mercie shall not depart from thee neither shall my couenant of peace fall away saith the lord that hath compassion on thee psalm for as high as the heauen is aboue the earth so great is his mercie toward them that feare him ioh my babes these things write i vnto you that ye sinne not and if any man sinne we haue an aduocate with the father iesus christ the iust and he is the reconciliation for our sinnes and not for ours onely but also for the sinnes of the whole world psalm let israel waite on the lord for the lord is mercie and with him is great redemption that god measureth the obedience due vnto him rather by the affection and desire to obey then by the act and performance of it rom for they that are after the flesh sauour the things of the flesh but they that are after the spirit the things of the spirit because the wisedome of the flesh is enmitie against god for it is not subiect to the law of god neither indeed can be rom now if i do that i would not it is no more i that do it but the sinne that dwelleth in me i find then by the law that when i would do good euill is present with me for i delight in the law of god concerning the inner man mal i will spare them as a man spareth his son that reuerenceth him when one sinne is forgiuen all the rest are remitted also for remission being giuen once without any prescription of time is giuen for euer rom for the gifts and calling of god are without repentance act to him also giue all the prophets witnesse that through his name all that beleeue in him shall receiue remission of sinnes that grace and faith are not taken away by fals of infirmitie but thereby are declared and made manifest rom moreouer the law entred thereupon that the offence should abound neuerthelesse where sin abounded there grace abounded much more corinthian and lest i should be exalted out of measure ampc there was giuen vnto me a pricke in the flesh the messenger of satan to buffet me for this thing i besought the lord thrice that it might depart from me he said my grace is sufficient for thee that all the workes of god are by contrarie meanes corinthian my power is made perfect through weaknesse by the blessing of god i will not forget to practise these soueraigne remedies if satan at any time seeke to take away my faith and to cut off this hand by which i must apply or to blindfold this eye by which i may behold christ sitting at god right hand as stephen did let me heare i pray you the third assault and what it concerneth the third assault is concerning sanctification what is this temptation the temptation is a prouoking to sinne according as the disposition of euery man and as occasion shall offer it selfe chronicle and satan stood vp against israel and prouoked dauid to number israel ioh and when supper was done the diuell had now put into the heart of iudas iscariot simons son to betray him let me not be ignorant of satans enterprise how will he allure to sinne in this temptation the diuell doth wonderfully diminish and extenuate those sins which man are about to commit partly by obiecting closely the mercie of god and partly by couering or hiding the punishment which is due for the sin besides there are helpes to further the diuell in this his temptation as first the flesh which lusteth against the spirit sometimes by begetting euill motions and affections and sometimes by ouerwhelming and oppressing the good intents and motions gal for the flesh lufteth against the spirit and the spirit against the flesh and these are contrarie one to another so that ye cannot do the same things that ye would moreouer the workes of the flesh are manifest which are adulterie fornication vncleanenesse wantonnesse idolatry witchcraft hatred debate emulations wrath contentions seditions heresies envy murthers drunkennesse gluttonie and such like whereof i tell you before as i also haue told you before that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdome of god iam but euery man is tempted when he is drawne away by his owne concupiscence and is entised secondly the world which bringeth man to disobedience through pleasure profite honour and euill examples ephesians among whom we also had our conuersation in time past in the lustes of the flesh in fulfilling the will of the flesh and of the mind and were by nature the children of wrath as well as others john for all that is in the world as the lusts of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the pride of life is not of the father but is of the world how may i resist this temptation resistance is made by the desire of the spirit which worketh good motions and affections in the faithfull and driueth foorth the euill gal but the fruite of the spirit is loue ioy peace long suffering gentlenesse goodnesse faith meekenesse temperancie against such there is no law for they that are christs haue crucified the flesh with the affections and the lusts thereof let vs not be desirous of vaine glorie prouoking one another enuying one another giue me here some preseruariues that i may resist the preseruatiues are these to account no sinne light or small gal alitle leauen doth leauen the whole lumpe rom for the wages of sinne is death but the gift of god is eternal life through iesus christ our lord to auoide all occasions of sinne to these rather agreeth the prouerb vsed of the plague long tard cit that is aloofe slowly quickly thessal abstaine from all appearance of euill iud v and other saue with feare pulling them out of the fire and hate euen the garment spotted by the flesh to accustome thy selfe to subdue the less sinnes that at the last thou maist also ouercome the greater rom to apply thy selfe to thy appointed calling and alway to be busily occupied about something in the same to oppose the law the iudgements of god the last iudgement the glorious presence of god and such like against the rebellion and loosenesse of the flesh pro blessed is the man that feareth alway but he that hardeneth his heart shall fall into euill gen there is no man greater in this house then i neither hath he kept any thing from me but onely thee because thou article his wife how then can i do this great wickednesse and so sinne against god but alas i see satan foyles me in many sins instruct me i pray you with some rules against them say i be angrie vnaduisedly or desire to reuenge wrongs done vnto me how may i remedie this my sinne against vniust anger or priuate desire of reuenge here meditate iniuries they happen vnto vs by the lord appointment for our good sam god of his great goodnesse forgiueth vs farre more sinnes then it is possible for vs to forgiue man it is the dutie of christian loue to forgiue others we must not desire to destroy them whom christ hath redeemed by his precious bloud we our selues are in daunger of the wrath of god if we suffer our wrath to burne against our brother forgiue saith he and it shall be forgiuen we know not the circumstances of the facts what the mind was and purpose of them against whom we swell bridles or externall remedies are these in this we shall imitate the clemencie of the lord who for a very great season doth often tolerate the wicked learne of me for i am humble and meeke there must be a pausing and time of delay between our anger and the execution of the same atheno rus counselled augustus that he being angrie should repeate all the letters of the alphabet or a b c before he against another did either speake or do any thing to depart out of those places where those are with whom we are angrie to auoide contention both in word and deed do nothing through contention say i sinne by couetousnesse and ambition what must i do remedies against those bad desires of riches and honor are god doth euen in famine quicke and reuiue them which feare him psalm the eye of the lord is vpon them that feare him to deliuer their soul from death and to preserue them from famine godlinesse is great gaine if the mind of man can be therewith content tim we do waite and looke for the resurrection of the bodie and eternall life therefore we should not take such carking care for this present mortall life we are servant in our fathers house therefore looke what is conuenient for vs that will he louingly bestow vpon vs the palpable blindnesse of an ambitious mind desireth to be set aloft that he may haue the greater downe falle and he feareth to be humbled lest he should not be exalted adam when he would needes be checke mate with god did bring both himselfe and his posteritie headlong destruction he is a very ambitious rob god which desireth to take that comme dation to himselfe which is appropriate only to the lord admit satan allures me to carnal vncleanenesse how may i preserue my selfe that i may with the wise virgin enter with the bridegrome preseruatiues against the desires of the flesh are he that will be christs disciple must euery day take vp his crosse luke they which are according to the spirit sauour of such things as are according to the spirit rom we ought to behaue selues as citizens of the kingdom of heauen philip we are the temple of god corinthian our members they are the mebers of christ corinthian and we ha dwelling within vs the spirit of christ which we should not grieue ephesians how may i fall in this temptations when you being preuented fall some offence gal what doth satan when one is thus llen here satan doth wonderfully aggrauate the offence committed and doth ac use and terrifie the offender with the iudgements of god mat then when iudas which betrayed him saw that he was condem d he repented himselfe and brought againe the thirtie peeces of siluer to the chiefe priests and elders saying i haue sinned betraying the innocent bloud but they said what is that to vs see thou to it and when he had cast downe the siluer peeces in the temple he departed and went and hanged himselfe what remedie is there if that i fall the remedie is a renewed repentance the beginning whereof is sorrow in regard of god for the same sinne the fruites hereof are especially seuen corinthian now i reioyce not that you were sorrie but that ye sorrowed to repentance for ye sorrowed godly so that in nothing ye were hurt by vs for godly sorrow causeth repentance vnto saluation not to be repented of but worldly sorrow causeth death for behold this thing that ye haue bene godly sorrie what great care hath it wrought in you yes what clearing of your selues yes what indignation yes what feare yes how great desire yes wh zeale yes what punishment in all things haue shewed your selues that ye are pure in this matter repeate out of this place those seuen fruites of repentance first a desire of doing well secondly an apologie that is a confession of the sinne before god with a requiring of pardon for the offence psalm then i acknowledged my sin vnto thee neither hid i mine iniquitie for i thought i will confesse against my selfe my wickednesse vnto the lord and thou forgauest the punishment of my sinne sam then dauid said vnto nathan i haue sinned against the lord and nathan said vnto dauid the lord also ha put away thy sinne thou shalt not die indignation against a mans selfe for his offence a feare not so much for the punishment as for offending the lord psalm if thou streightly markest iniquities o lord who shall stand a desire to be fully renewed and to be deliuered from sinne a feruent zeale to loue god and to embrace and keepe all his commandements reuenge whereby the flesh may be ta ed and subdued lest at any time afterward such offences be committed blessed be god that thus teacheth e by you let me speake yet vnto you concerning calamities i reade in the scriptures of the patient bearing of the crosse what wil it teach me the patient bearing of the crosse teacheth how christians should vndergo the burden vvhat i pray you is the crosse the crosse is a certaine measure of afflictions appointed by god to euery one of the faithfull math if any man wil follow me let him forsake himselfe take vp his crosse and follow me column now reioyce i in my sufferings for you and fulfill the rest of the afflictions of christ in my flesh for his body sake which is the church how must this crosse be taken vp we ought to take vp this crosse willingly euen with both hands when it shall please god to lay it vpon vs and after we haue taken it vp we must beare it with patience and perseuerance column strengthened with all might through his glorious power vnto all patience and long suffering with ioyfulnesse luke possesse your soules with patience how may i preserue patience the preseruatiues of patience are first strength by the holy ghost philipp i am able to do all things through the helpe of christ which strengtheneth me philipp it is giuen to you for christ that not onely ye should beleeue in him but also suffer for his sake an holy meditation which is manifold that the afflictions of the faithful come not by chance but by the counsell and prouidence of god which disposeth all things in a most excellent sort gen it was god that sent ioseph into egypt sam the lord biddeth shemei curse dauid psalm it was good for me that i was afflicted that i might learne thy statutes hence it is euident that afflictions to the godly are ineuitable act by many afflictions you must enter into the kingdome of god mat the gate is streight and the way narrow that leadeth vnto life and few there be that find it john in the world ye shall haue troubles that albeit afflictions are grieuous yet are they good and profitable for they are helpes whereby man being humbled for their sinnes before god obtaine peace and holinesse of life corinthian we receiued sentence of death in our selues because we should not trust in our selues but in god which raiseth the dead isaiah lord in trouble haue they visited thee they powred out a prayer when thy chastening was vpon them hos i will go and returne to my place till they acknowledge their fault and seeke me in their affliction they will seeke me diligently psalm when he flue them they sought him and they returned and they sought god early ierem i haue heard ephraim lamenting thus thou hast corrected me and i was chastised as an vntamed calfe conuert thou me and i shall be conuerted heb no chastisement for the present see eth ioyous but grieuous but afterward it bringeth the quiet fruit of righteousnesse vnto them which are thereby exercised psalm weeping may abide at euening but ioy commeth in the morning john euery branch that beareth fruit he purgeth it that it may bring forth re fruite pet wherein ye reioyce though now for a season if need require ye are in heauinesse through many temptations corinthian the god of all comfort which comforteth vs in all our tribulations that we may be able to comfort them which are in affliction by the comfort wherewith our selues are comforted of god rom we glory in afflictions knowing that affliction bringeth patience heb he did consecrate the prince of their saluation through affliction we permit chirurgians that they both bind vs lying diseased in our beds and seare vs with hot irons yes lanch and search our members with rasors and lastly we send them away vsually with friendly and kind speeches amp often with a golden fee for their thus handling vs shal we the suffer so many things of a chirurgian to cure a bodily disease and will we not giue god leaue to cure by afflictions the most festered diseases of our sicke soules what is to be gathered hence by this we may gather that the afflictions of the godly are signes of their adoption heb whom the lord loueth he chasteneth and he scourgeth euery son that he receiueth if ye endure chastisement god offereth himselfe vnto you as vnto son and that they are to them the kings high way to heauen iames blessed the man that endureth temptation for when he is tried he shall receiue the crowne of life which the lord hath promised to them that loue corinthian for our light affliction which i but for a moment causeth vnto vs a farre more excellent and an eternall waight of glory that god hath promised fauour mitigation of punishment his presence and deliuerance philip corinthian god is faithfull who will not suffer you to be tempted aboue measure but with temptation will giue deliuerance sam psalm call vpon me in time of trouble and i will deliuer thee and thou shalt glorifie me psalm he that keepeth israel will neither slumber nor sleepe isaiah when thou passest through the water i will be with thee and through the flouds that they do not ouerwhelme thee when thou walkest through the very fire thou shalt not burne neither shal the flame kindle vpon thee for i am the lord thy god the holy one of israel thy sauiour that in all troubles of the faithfull christ is a companion pet reioyce that ye are partakers of the afflictions of christ corinthian euery where we beare about in our bodie the dying of christ that the life of iesus might also be made manifest in our body column that the angels are readie to defend such as feare god psalm kings feare not there are more with vs then against vs but of all calamities the remembrance of death is fearful vnto me giue me i pray you some few preseruatiues against it against the feare of death note these preseruatiues first death it freeth the godly from the tyrannie of satan sinne the world the flesh and eternall damnation yes fro infinite both perils and losses and doth place vs both safe and happie vnder the shadow as it were of christs wings secondly christ by his death hath sanctified vnto vs both death and the graue christ is both in life and death gaine to the godly philipp those consolations which the spirit of christ doth suggest to the soules of the faithful do by many degrees surmount the dolors of death the desire of that most bright and glorious beholding of god and the presence of those saints which are departed before vs in stead of our body we shall be clothed with glory corinthian the sting of death namely sin is then so taken away as that that serpent can no more hurt vs corinthian o death where i thy sting o graue where is thy victory heb that he might deliuer all them which for feare of death were all their life time subiect to bondage we should not so much thinke of our death as to take an exact account of our life for that man cannot die ill who hath liued well and he seldome dieth well that hath liued badly the angels they stand at our elbowes that so soone as a saint departeth they may with al speed immediatly transport his soule into heauen soules being once in heauen remain ther till the last day of iudgement where they partly magnifie the name of god and partly do waite and pray for the consummation of the kingdom of glory and ful felicitie in body and soule reu and when he had taken the booke the foure beast and the foure and twenty elders fell down before the lamb hauing euery one harpes and golden vials full of odours which are the prayers of the saints and they sang a new song saying thou article worthy to take the booke and to open the seales thereof because thou wast killed and hast redeemed vs to god by thy bloud out of euery kinred and tong and people and nation revelation i heard the voice of harpers harping with their harpes and they sung as it were a new song before the throne and they cried with a loud voice saying how long lord holy and true doest not thou iudge and auenge our bloud on them that dwel on the earth yet for all this satan in the time of temptation and at the houre of death wil go about to perswade me that these things do not belong vnto me what must i do then descend into your owne heart see whether you haue god spirit or no testifying vnto you that you are god child for as many as haue the spirit of god they are the children of god but how shall i know whether this testimonie come from god spirit or from carnall presumption first by a full perswasion which you shall haue for the holy ghost will not barely say it but perswade you that you are god child which the flesh cannot do secondly by the maner of perswasion for the holy ghost draweth not reasons from the works and worthinesse of man but from god fauour and loue and this kind of perswasion differeth much from that which satan vseth thirdly by the effects of that testimonie for if the perswasion arise from presumption it is a dead perswasion but contrariwise it is most liuely and stirring if it come from the holy ghost for such as are perswaded that they are elected and adopted the children of god they wil loue god trust in him and cal vpon him with their whole heart alas i find this testimonie maruellous feeble in me are there not other meanes by which i may be comforted in this temptation of satan that i am not god child yes verily if you feele not the flame of god spirit in you then must you iudge of it by the heate and if you find the effects of sanctification in you you are without doubt in the state of grace which i pray you be they of all the effects of sanctification you may iudge of your adoption by these that follow first if you feele your wants and with griefe bewaile the offence to god in euery sinne if you striue against the flesh that is resist and hate the first motions thereof and with griefe thinke them burthenous and troublesome thirdly if you desire earnestly and vehemently the grace of god and merite of christ to obtaine eternall life when you haue obtained it to account it a most precious i well and all things to be as dung in respect of it philipp if you loue a minister of the gospell as he is a minister and a christian as he is a christian and if need require can be readie to giue your life for them john if you call earnestly vpon god euen with teares if you desire christs comming to iudgement that an end might be made of these dayes of sin if you flie all occasions of sin and endeuor to come to newnesse of life and last of all if you perseuere vnto the last gaspe in these things for as one saith he that wil serue god must beleeue that which he cannot see hope for that which is deferred loue god when he shewes himself an enemie and thus remaine to the end these indeed are sure effects of sanctification but euen these are weake in me as the former are they so then know that god tameth you yet so as you must not therewith be dismaied for it is certaine that if you haue faith but as a graine of mustard seed and be as weake as a yong infant it is sufficient to engraft you into christ and therefore you must not doubt of your owne election by reason of your weaknesse a child holding a staffe in his hand holdeth it as well as a man though not with so much strength and you laying hold vpon christ by faith though you do it neuer so weakely it will suffise for your saluation nay if one haue not yet felt these effects in his heart he must not conclude he is a reprobate but must rather vse the word of god and the sacraments that he may haue inward sense of the power of christ drawing him vnto him and an assurance of his redemption by christs death and passion he that opened the heart of lidia to heare paul open my heart to know and do these things amen

question what dost thou believe concerning god a there is one god creator and governor of all things distinguished into the father the son and the holy ghost for the invisible things of him that is his eternal power and godhead are seen by the creation of the world being considered in his works to the intent that they should be with out excuse novertheless he left not himself without witness in that he did good and gave us rain from heaven and fruitful seasons filling our hearts with food and gladness concerning therefore meats sacrificed to idols we know that an idol is nothing in the world and that there is none other god but one in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth through faith we understand that the world was ordained by the word of god so that the things which we see are not made of things which did appeare the eyes of the lord in every place behold the evil and the good yes and all the haires of your heads are numbred and jesus when he was baptized came straight out of the water and loe the heavens were opened unto him and john saw the spirit of god descending like a dove and lighting upon him and loe a voice came from heaven saying this is my beloved son in whom i am well pleased for there are three that bare record in heaven the father the word and the holy ghost and these three are one q what doest thou believe concerning man and concerning thine own self a all man are wholly corrupted with sin through adams fall and so are become slave of satan and guilty of eternal damnation as it is written there is none righteous no not one now the very god of peace sanctifie you throughout and i pray god that your whole spirit and soul and body may be kept blameless unto the coming of our lord jesus christ this i say therefore and testifie in the lord that ye henceforth walk not as other gentiles walk in the vanity of their minds having their cogitations darkned and being strangers from the life of god through the ignorance that is in them because of the hardness of their hearts when the lord saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth and all the imaginations of the thoughts of his heart were onely evil continually wherefore as by one man sin entred into the world and death by sin and so death went over all man for so much as all man have sinned wherein in times past ye walked according to the course of the world and after the prince that ruleth in the air even the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience for as much then as the children were partakers of flesh and blood he also himself likewise took part with them that he might destroy through death him that had the power of death that is the devil in whom the god of this world hath blinded the mindes that is of infidel that the light of the glorious gospel of christ which is the image of god should not shine unto them for as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse for it is written cursed is every man that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them likewise then as by the offence of one the fault came on all man to condemnation so by the justifying of one the benefit abounded towards all man to the justification of life q vvhat means is there for thee to escape this damnable estate a jesus christ the eternal son of god being made man by his death upon the cross and by his righteousness hath perfectly alone by himself accomplished all things that are needful for the salvation of man kind and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we saw the glory thereof as the glory of the onely begotten son of the father full of grace and truth for he in no sort took the angels but he took the seed of abraham but he was wounded for our transgressions he was broken for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed for as by one mans disobedience many were made sinners so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous for he hath made him to be sin for us which knew no sin that we should be made the righteousness of god in him wherefore he is able also perfectly to save them that come unto god by him seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them neither is there salvation in any other for among man there is given none other name under heaven whereby we must be saved and he is the reconciliation for our sins and not for ours onely but also for the sins of the whole world q but how mayest thou be made partaker of christ and his benefits a a man of a contrite and humble spirit by faith alone apprehending amp applying christ with all his merits unto himself is justified before god and sanctified for thus saith he that is high and excellent he that inhabiteth eternity whose name is the holy one i dwell in the high and holy place with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit to revive the spirit of the humble and to give life to them that are of a contrite heart the sacrifices of god are a contrite spirit a contrite and a broken heart o god thou wilt not despise as soon as jesus heard that word spoken he said unto the ruler of the synagogue be not afraid onely believe so moses made a serpent of brass and set it up for a sign and when a serpent had bitten any man then he looked to the serpent of brass and lived and as moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness so must the son of man be lifted up that who soever believeth in him should not perish but have eternal life but as many as received him to them he gave power to be the son of god to them that believe in his name and jesus said unto them i am the bread of life he that cometh to me shall not hunger and he that believeth in me shall never thirst for what saith the scripture abraham believed god and it was counted to him for righteousness even as david declareth the blessedness of the man unto whom god emputeth righteousness without works saying blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven and whose sins are covered and he put no difference between us and them after that by faith he had purified their hearts but ye are of him in christ jesus who of god is made unto us wisdom and righteousness and sanctification and redemption q vvhat are the ordinary or usual means for obtaining of faith a faith cometh onely by the preaching of the vvord and increaseth daily by it as also by the administration of the s craments and prayer but how shall they call on him in whom they have not believed and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard and how shall they hear without a preacher where there is no vision the people decay but he that keepeth the law is blessed my people are destroyed for lack of knowledge because thou hast refused knowledge i will also refuse thee that thou shalt be no priest to me and seeing thou hast for gotten the law of thy god i will also forget thy children after he received the sign of circumcision as the seal of the righteousness of faith which he had when he was uncircumcised that he should be the father of all them that believe not being circumcised that righteousness might be imputed to them also moreover brother i would not that ye should be ignorant that all our fathers were under the cloud and all passed through the sea ampc for whosoever shall call upon the name of the lord shall be saved q what is the state of all man after death a all man shall rise again with their own body to the last judgement which being ended the godly shall possess the kingdom of heaven but unbelievers and reprobates shall be in hell tormented with the devil and his angels for ever marvel not at this for the hour shall come in the which all that are in the grave shall hear his voice and they shall come forth that have done good unto the resurrection of life but they that have done evil unto the resurrection of condemnation for god will bring every work unto judgement with every secret thing whether it be good or evil but i say unto you that of every idle word that man shall speak they shall give an account thereof at the day of judgment and del vered just lot vexed with the unclean conversation of the wicked and the lord said unto him go through the midst of the city even through the midst of the city even through the midst of jerusalem and set a mark upon the foreheads of them that mourn and cry out for all the abominations that be done in the midst thereof then shall the king say to them on the right hand come ye blessed of my father inherit ye the kingdom prepared for you from the beginning of the world then shall he say unto them on the left hand depart from me ye cursed into everlasting fire which is prepared for the devil and his angels the scriptures for proof were onely quoted by

man either are or have been there q what other reason have you a rom gen amp a man that commits any sin as murther fornication adultery blasphemy ampc albeit he doth so conceal the matter that no man

grace of god by which a man doth apprehend and apply christ and all his benefits unto himself q how doth a man apply christ unto himself seeing we are on earth and christ in heaven a this corinthian rom applying is done by assurance when a man is verily perswaded by the holy spirit of god favor towards himself particularly and of the forgiveness of his own sins q how doth god bring man truly to believe in christ a first he prepareth their hearts that they might be capable of faith and then worketh faith in them q how doth god prepare mens hearts a ezek hos by bruising them as if one would

believer shall be accepted before god judgement seat as worthy of eternal life by the merits of the same righteousness of christ q do not good works then make us worthy of eternal life a no for god who is perfect righteousness it self will finde in the best works we do more matter of damnation then of salvation and therefore psalm isaiah job we must rather condemn our selves for our good works then look to be justified before god thereby q how may a man know that he is justified before god a he need not ascend into heaven to search the secret counsel of god rom john but rather descend into his own heart to search whether he be sanctified or not q vvhat is it to be sanctified a it comprehendeth two things the first to be purged from the corruption of his own nature the second to be indued with inward righteousness q how is the corruption of sin purged a by the rom merits and power of christs death which being by faith applyed is as a pet corrasive to abate consume and weaken the

hell q what followeth after this sorrow a repentance corinthian renewed afresh q by what signs will this repentance appear a by corinthian seven a care to leave the sin into which he is faln an utter condemning of himself for it with a craving of pardon a great anger against himself for his carelesness a fear lest he should fall into the same sin again a desire ever after to please god a zeal of

the administration of the sacraments and prayer q where is the word of god to be found a the whole word of god needful to salvation is set down in the holy scriptures q how know you that the scriptures are the word of god and not mens policies a i am assured of it first ephesians because the holy ghost perswadeth my conscience that it is so secondly i see it by experience for the preaching of the heb corinthian scriptures have the power of god in them to humble a man when they are preached and to cast him down to hell and afterward to restore and raise him up again q vvhat is the use of the vvord of god preached a first it rom breedeth and then it increaseth faith in them which are chosen to salvation but unto them that perish it is by reason of their corruption an occasion of their further damnation q how must we hear god vvord that it may be effectual to our salvation a vve james act heb isaiah luke psalm must come unto it with hunger bitten hearts having an appetite to the vvord wt must mark it with attention receive it by faith submit our selves unto it with fear and trembling even then when our faults are reproved lastly we must hide it in the corners of our hearts that we may frame our lives and conversations by it q vvhat is a sacrament a rom gen gal a sign to represent a seal to confirm an instrument to convey christ and all his benefits to them that do believe in him q vvhy must a sacrament represent the mercies of god before our eyes a because we are dull to conceive and to remember them q vvhy do the sacraments seal unto us the mercies of god a because we are full of unbelief and doubting of them q vvhy is the sacrament the instrument of the spirit to convey the mercies of god into our hearts a because we are like thomas we will not believe till we feel them in some measure in our hearts q how many sacraments are there a two corinthian and no more baptism by which we have our admission into the true church of god and the lord supper by which we are nourished and preserved in the true church after our admission q vvhat is done in baptism a act tit act mat in the assembly of the church the covenant of grace between god and

party baptized bound a to mark receive christ and to repent of his sins q what meaneth the sprinkling or dipping in water a pet it seals unto us remission of sins and sanctification by the obedience and sprinkling of the blood of christ q how cometh it to pass that many after their baptism for a long time feel not the effect and fruit of it and some never a the fault is not in god who keeps his covenant but the fault is in themselves in that they do not keep the condition of the covenant to receive christ by faith and to repent of all their sins q when shall a man then see the effect of his baptism a at heb pet what time soever he doth receive christ by faith though it be many years after he shall then feel the power of god to regenerate him and to work all things in him which he offered in baptism q how if a man never keep the condition to which he bound himself in baptism a his deut ecclesiastes damnation shall be the greater because he breaketh his vow made to god q what is done in the lord supper a the former covenant solemnly ratified in baptism is renewed corinthian ampc amp in the lord supper between the lord himself and the receiver q who is the receiver a every one corinthian mat isaiah that hath been baptized and after his baptism hath truely believed in christ and repented of his sins from his heart q what meaneth the bread and wine the eating of the bread and drink of the wine a these outward actions corinthian are a second seal set by the lord own hand unto his covenant and they do give every receiver to understand that as god doth bless the bread and wine to preserve and strengthen the body of the receiver so christ apprehended and received by faith shall nourish him and preserve both body and soul unto eternal life q what shall a true receiver feel in himself after the receiving of the sacrament a corinthian amp the increase of his faith in christ the increase of sanctification a greater measure of dying to sin a greater care to live in newness of life q vvhat if a man after the receiving of the sacrament never finde any such thing in himself a he may well suspect himself whether he did ever repent or not and thereupon is to use means to come to sound faith and repentance q vvhat is another means of increasing faith a prayer q vvhat is prayer a a john familiar speech with god in the name of christ tim philipp in which either we crave things needful or give thanks for things received q in asking things needful what is required a two things an earnest desire and faith q t vvhat things must a christian mans heart desire a

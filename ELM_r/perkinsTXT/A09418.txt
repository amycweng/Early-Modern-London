for euer question what is god a god is a ioh spirit or a spirituall substace most wise most holie eternall infinite q how doo you perswade your self that there is such a god a besides the testimonie of the scriptures plaine reason will shew it q what is one reason a when i consider rom act the wonderfull frame of the world me thinks the silly creatures y t be in it could neuer make it neither could it make itselfe and therefore besides al these the maker of it must nedes be god euen as when a man comes into a strange countrey and sees faire and sumptuous buildings and yet findes no liuing creatures there beside birds and beast hee will not imagine that either birds or beast reared by those buildings but he presently conceiues that some man either were or haue been there q what other reason haue you a rom gen amp a man that commits any sinne as murder fornication adultery blasphemie ampc albeit he dooth so conceale the matter that no man liuing know of it yet oftentimes he hath a griping in his conscience and feeles the verie flashings of hel fire which is a strong reason to shew that there is a god before whose iudgement seate he must answere for his fact q how many god are there a no corinthian more but one q how doo you conceiue this one god in your minde a not deut amos by framing any image of him in my minde as ignorant folkes doo that thinke him to be an olde man sitting in heauen but i conceaue him by his properties and works q what be his chiefe properties a first he is iob most wise vnderstanding all things aright and knowing the reason of them esay exod secondly hee is most holy which appeareth in that hee is most iust and mercifull vnto his creatures thirdly hee is eternall isay without either beginning or ende of dayes lastly hee is infinite psalm all both because hee is present in all places and because hee is of power sufficient to doo whatsoeuer hee iob deut will q what be the workes of god a iere psalm the creation of the world and of euery thing therein and the preseruation of them beeing created by his speciall prouidence q how knowe you that god gouerneth euery particular thing in the world by his speciall prouidence a to omit the matthew prou scriptures i see it by experience leuit matthew meate drinke and cloathing being void of life could not preserue the life of man vnlesse there were a speciall prouidence of god to giue vertue vnto them q how is this one god distinguished a john matth into the father which begetteth the son into the son who is begotten of the father into the holie ghost ioh who proceedeth from the father and the son q let vs now come to our selues and first tel me what is the natural estate of man a euerie man is by nature ephesian tim dead in sinne as a loathsome carrion or as a dead corps lieth rotting and stincking in the graue q what is sinne a any ioh rom gal breach of the lawe of god if it bee no more but the least want of that which the lawe requireth q how many sortes of sinne are there a sinne is either coloss psalm the corruption of nature or any evil actions that proceede of it as fruites thereof q in whome is this corruption of nature a in all man rom none excepted q in what part of man is it a in euerie gen thess part both of bodie and soule like as a leprosie that runneth from the crowne of the head to the sole of the foote q shew mee how euerie parte of man is corrupted with sinne a first in the corinthian rom mind there is nothing but ignorance and blindnesse concerning heauenlie matters secondly tit ephe esay the coscience is defiled being alwaies either benummed with sin or els turmoyled with inward accusations and terrours thirdly phi iob the wil of man only willeth and lusteth after euill fourthly the gal affections of the heart as loue ioy hope desire ampc are moued amp stirred to that which is evil to embrace it and they are neuer stirred vnto that which is good vnlesse it be to eschewe it lastly the rom members of the bodie are the instruments and tooles of the minde for the execution of sinne q what be those evil actions that are the fruites of this corruption a euill gen thoughts in the mind which come either by a mans own conceiuing or by the ioh act chro suggestion of the diuell euill motions and lusts sturring in the heart and from thes arise euill words and deedes when any occasion is giuen q how commeth it to passe that al man are thus defiled with sinne a by rom gen adams infidelitie and disobedience in eating the forbidden fruite euen as wee see great personages b treason doo not only hurt themselues but also staine their bloud amp disgrac their posteritie q what hurt comes to man by his sinne a gal he is continually subiect to th curse of god in his life time in th end of his life and after this life q what is the cursse of god in this life a in deut the body diseases aches paines in the soule blindnesse hardnesse of heart horrour of conscience in goods hinderances and losses in name ignominie and reproach lastly in the whole man bondage vnder sathan the prince of darkenesse q what manner of bondage is this a this heb ephe corinthian luke bondage is when a man is the slaue of the diuell and hath him to raigne in his heart as his god q how may a man knowe whether sathan be his god or not a he may know it by this if hee giue obedience to him in his heart and expresse it in his conuersation q and how shall a man perceiue this obedience a if he ioh ioh take delight in the euill motions that sathan puts into his heart and doo fulfill the lusts of the diuell q what is the cursse due to man in the end of his life a rom death which is the seperation of bodie and soule q what is the cursse after this life a gal rom eternall damnation in hell fire whereof euerie man is guiltie and is in as great danger of it as the traitor apprehended is in danger of hanging drawing and quartering q if damnation be the reward of sinne then is a man of all creatures most miserable a dog or a toade when they die all their miserie is ended but when a man dieth there is the beginning of his woe a it were so indeede if there were no meanes of deliuerance but god hath shewed his mercie in giuing a sauiour to mankinde q how is this sauiour called a matthew iesus christ q what is iesus christ a the heb ioh eternall son of god made man in all things euen heb mark in his infirmities like other man saue onelie in sinne q how was hee made man voide of sinne a he was matthew conceiued in the womb of a virgin and sanctified by the holy ghost at his conception q why must our sauiour bee both god and man a he tim must be a man because man hath sinned and therefore a man must die for sinne to appease god wrath hee must bee god to sustaine and vphold the manhood to ouercome and vanquish death q what be the offices of christ to make him an al sufficient sauiour a he psalm luke deut luke psalm all is a priest a prophet a king q why is he a priest a to worke the meanes of saluation in the behalfe of mankinde q how doth he worke the meanes of saluation a matth heb first by making satisfaction to his father for the sinne of man secondly by making intercession q how doth he make satisfaction a by two meanes and the first is by offer a sacrifice q what is this sacrifice a esay christ himselfe as hee is man consisting of bodie and soule q what is the apocrypha heb aulter a christ as he is god is the aulter on which he sacrificed himselfe q who was the priest a none but heb christ and that as he is both god and man q how oft did he sacrifice himself a neuer but heb once q what death did hee suffer when he sacrificed himselfe a a death vpon the crosse peculiar to him alone for esay ioh revelation luke besides the seperation of body and soule hee felt also the panges of hell in that the whole wrath of god due to the sinne of man was powred foorth vpon him q what profit commeth by this sacrifice a god heb wrath is appeased for sin q could the suffering of christ which was but for a short time appease god wrath a yes for seeing christ suffered act corinthian god suffered and that is more than if all man in the world had suffered for euer q now tell mee the other meanes of satisfaction a it is the perfect fulfilling of the lawe q how did he fulfill the lawe a by corinthian rom corinthian his perfect righteousnes which consisteth of two partes the first the integritie and purenesse of his humaine nature the other rom rom his obedience in performing all that the lawe required q you haue shewed how christ dooth make satisfaction tell mee likewise how he doth make intercession a hee alone dooth continually rom pet appeare before his father in heauen making the faithful amp all their praiers acceptable vnto him through the merits of his owne perfect satisfaction q why is christ a prophet a to ioh matth reueale vnto his church the way and meanes of saluation and this hee dooth outwardly by the ministerie of his word and inwardlie by the teaching of his holy spirit q why is he also a king a that esay hee might bountifullie bestow vpon vs and conuey vnto vs all the foresaid meanes of saluation q how dooth hee shew himselfe to be a king a in acts ephesian act that being dead and buried he rose from the graue quickned his dead body ascended into heauen and now sitteth at the right hand of his father with full power and glorie in heauen q how else a in isaiah and that he doth continually inspire and direct his servant by the diuine power of his holy spirit according to his holy word q but to whome will this blessed king communicate all meanes of saluation a hee ioh ioh offereth them to all mankinde and they are sufficient to saue all mankinde but all shall not bee saued thereby because by faith they will not receiue them q what is faith a faith is a ioh amp gal coloss wonderfull grace of god by which a man doth apprehend and applie christ and all his benefits vnto himselfe q how dooth a man apply christ vnto himselfe seeing we are on earth and christ in heauen a this corinthian rom applying is done by assurance when a man is verily perswaded by the holy spirit of god fauour towards himselfe particularly amp of the forgiuenesse of his owne sinnes q how dooth god bring man trulie to beleeue in christ a first he prepareth their hearts that they might bee capable of faith and then he worketh faith in them q how doth god prepare mes harts a ezech hos by brusing them as if one would breake an hard stone to pouder and this is done by humbling them q how doth god humble a man a by working in him a sight of his sinnes and a sorrow for them q how is the sight of sin wrought a by the rom amp morall law the summe whereof is the ten commandements q what sinnes may i finde in my selfe by them a ten q what is the first a comand i to make some thing thy god which is not god by fearing it louing it so trusting in it more than in the true god q what is the second a ii to worship false god or the true god in a false manner q what is the third a iii to dishonour god in abusing his titles words and workes q what is the fourth a iiii to breake the sabaoth in dooing the works of their calling and of the flesh and in leauing vndone the workes of the spirit q what be the sixe latter a to do any thing that may hinder thy neighbours v dignitie vi life vii chastity viii wealth ix good name x though it be but in the secret thoughts and motions of thy heart vnto which thou giuest no liking nor consent q what is sorrow for sinne a it is act cant when a mans conscience is touched with a liuely feeling of god displeasure for any of these sinnes in tim luke such wise that hee is wholly out of heart with himselfe acknowledging that he hath deserued shame and confusion eternally q how doth god work this sorrow a by the terrible curse of the law q what is that a he gal which breakes but one of the commandements of god though it be but once in all his life time amp that onely in one thought is in danger of eternall damnation thereby q when mens hearts are thus prepared how doth god engraft faith in them a by working certaine inwarde motions in the heart which are the seed of faith out of which it breedeth q what is the first of them a when a man humbled vnder the burden of his sinnes dooth esay ioh luke acknowledge and feele that he stands in great neede of christ q what is the second a an revelation hungring desire and a longing to be made partakers of christ and all his merits q what is the third a heb a flying to the throne of grace from the sentence of the law pricking the conscience q how is this done a by luke mat act corinthian praying with sending vp lowde cries for god fauour in christ in the pardoning of sinne and with feruent perseuerance herein till the desire of the heart be graunted q what followeth after all this a god then math esay according to his merciful promise lets the poore sinner feele the assurance of his loue wherewith hee loueth him in christ which assurance is a liuely faith q are there diverse degrees and measures of true faith a rom luke yes q what is the least measure of true faith that any man can haue a when a man of an humble spirit by reason of the esay matthew luke littlenes of his faith doth not yet feele the assurance of the forgiuenes of his sinnes and yet he is perswaded that they are pardonable and therefore desireth that they should be pardoned amp with his heart prayeth to god to pardon them q how doo you know that such a man hath faith a these rom gal matthew desires and prayers are testimonie of the spirit whose propertie it is to stirre vp a longing and a lusting after heauenly things with sighes and groanes for god fauour and mercie in christ nowe rom ephe where the spirit of christ is there is christ dwelling and where christ dwelleth there is true fayth how weake soeuer it be q what is the greatest measure of fayth a when a man is fully perswaded of god loue in christ towardes himselfe particularly and of the forgiuenes of his owne sinnes q when shall a christian heart come to this full assurance a not tim psalm with at the first but in some continuance of time when hee hath been well practized in repentaunce and hath had diverse experiences of god loue vnto him in christ then after them will appeare in his heart the fulnes of perswasion which is the ripenes ro and strength of faith q what benefites doth a man receiue by his fayth in christ a hereby corinthian act rom hee is iustified before god and sanctified q what is this to bee iustified before god a it rom compreheneth two things the first to be cleared from the guiltinesse and punishment of sinne the second to bee accepted as perfectly righteous before god q how is a man cleared from the guiltines and punishment of his sinne a by christs collos pet ioh sufferings and death vpon the crosse q howe is he accepted righteous before god corinthian a by the righteousnes of christ imputed to him q what profit comes by being thus iustified a hereby rom apocrypha and by no other means in the world the beleeuer shall bee accepted before god iudgement seate as worthie of eternall life by the merits of the same righteousnesse of christ q doo not good works then make vs worthie of eternall life a no for god who is perfect righteousnesse it selfe will finde in the best workes wee doo more matter of damnation than of saluation amp therefore psalm esay wee must rather condemne our selues for our good works than looke to be iustified before god thereby q how may a man know that hee is iustified before god a he neede not ascend into heauen to search the secret counsell of god rom john but rather descend into his own hart to search whether he be sanctified or not q what is it to be sanctified a it comprehendeth two things the first to be purged from the corruption of his owne nature the second to be indued with inward righteousnes q howe is the corruption of sinne purged a by the rom pet merites and power of christs death which being by faith applyed is as a corasiue to abate cosume amp weaken the power of all sinne q howe is a man indued with inherent righteousnes a through the rom phillip vertue of christs resurrection which being applied by fayth is as a restoratiue to reuiue a man that is dead in sin to newnes of life q in what part of man is sanctfication wrought a in thess euery part of body amp soule q in what time is it wrought a it is rom corinthian begun in this life in which the faythfull receiue onely the first fruits of the spirit and it is not finished before the end of this life q what graces of the spirit do vsually shewe themselues in the heart of a man sanctified a the hatred psalm amp amp rom of sinne and the loue of righteousnes q what proceedes of them a repentance which is psalm a settled purpose in the heart with a careful indeuour to leaue all his sinnes and to liue a christian life q what goeth with repentance a a continual fighting and strugling against the assaults of a mans owne flesh against the motions of the diuell and the enticements of the world q what followeth after a man hath gotten the victory in any temptation or affliction a rom corinthian experience of god loue in christ and so increase of peace of conscience and ioy in the holy ghost q what followes if in any temptation he bee ouercome and through infirmitie fall a after a while corinthian matth there wil arise a godly sorrow which is whe a man is grieued for no other cause in y e worlde but for this onely y t by his sin he hath displeased god who hath bin vnto him a most merciful amp louing father q what signe is there of this sorowe a the true signe pet of it is this when a man can be grieued for the very disobedience to god in his euill worde or deede though hee should neuer bee punished and though there were neither heauen nor hell q what followes after this sorowe a repentance corinthian renewed a fresh q by what signes will this repentance appeare a ay corinthian seauen a care to leaue the sinne into which hee is fallen an vtter condemning of himselfe for it with a crauing of pardon a great anger against himselfe for hi carelesnesse a feare least hee shoul fall into the same sinne againe desire euer after to please god zeale of the same reuenge vpo himselfe for his former offence q what outward meanes mus wee vse to obtaine faith and all blesssings of god which come by faith a the preaching prou rom mat of god word and the administration of the sacraments and prayer q where is the word of god to be found a the whole word of god needefull to saluation is set down in the holy scriptures q how know you that the scriptures are the word of god and no mens pollicies a i am assured of it first ephesian because the holy ghost perswadeth my conscience that it is so secondly i see it by experience for the preaching of the heb corinthian scriptures haue the power of god in them to humble a man when they are preached and to cast him downe to hell and afterward to restore and raise him vp againe q what is the vse of the word of god preached a first it rom corinthian hebr breedeth and then it increaseth faith in them which are chose to saluatio but vnto them that perish it is by reason of their corruption an occasion of their further damnation q how must we heare god word y t it may be effecuall to our saluation a wee iam act hebr esay luke psalm must come vnto it with hunger bitten hearts hauing an appetite to the worde we must mark it with attention receiue it by faith submit our selues vnto it with feare and trembling euen then when our faults are reproued lastly wee must hide it in the corners of our hearts that wee may frame our liues and conuersations by it q what is a sacrament a a rom gen gal signe to represent a seale to confirme an instrument to conuey christ and all his benefites to them that doo beleeue in him q why must a sacramet represent the mercies of god before our eyes a because we are dull to conceiue and to remember them q why doth the sacrament seale vnto vs the mercies of god a because we are full of vnbeleefe and doubting of them q why is the sacrament the instument of the spirite to conuey the mercies of god into our hearts a because we are like thomas we will not beleeue till wee feele them in some measure in our hearts q how many sacramets are there a two corinthian and no more baptisme by which wee haue our admission into the true church of god and the lord supper by which wee are nourished and preserued in the church after our admission q what is done in baptisme a act tit act matth solemnly in the assembly of the church a couenant is made betweene the lord and the party baptized q in y e making of this couenat what doth god promise to y e party baptized a gal pet christ with all blessings that come by him q to what condition is the party baptized bound a to mark receiue christ and to repent of his sinne q what meaneth the sprinkling or dipping in water a the couenant being solemnly made is therby sealed and confirmed q how commeth it to passe that many after their baptisme for a long time feele not the effect and fruit of it and some neuer a the fault is not in god who keepes his couenants but the fault is in themselues in that they doo not keepe the condition of the couenant to receiue christ by faith and to repent of all their sinnes q when shall a man then see the effect of his baptisme a at what hebr pet time soeuer he doth receiue christ by faith though it bee an hundred yeares after hee shall then feele the power of god to regenerate him amp to work al things in him which he offered in baptisme q howe if a man neuer keepe the condition to which he bound himselfe in baptisme a his damnation deut eccl shal be the greater because hee breaketh his vowe made to god q what is done in the l supper a the former couenant made in baptisme is renued in corinthian and the lord supper betweene the lord himselfe amp the receiuer q what is the receiuer a euery one corinthian matth esay that hath been baptized and after his baptisme hath truly beleeued in christ and repented of his sinne from his heart q what meaneth the bread amp wine the eating of the bread amp drink of the wine a these outward actions corinthian are a second seale set by the lordes owne hand vnto his couenant and they doo giue euery receiuer to vnderstad that as god doth blesse the bread amp wine to preserue amp strengthen the bodie of the receiuer so christ receiued by faith shall nourish him and preserue both bodie and soule vnto eternall life q what shall a true receiuer feele in himselfe after the receiuing of the sacrament a corinthian amp the increase of his faith in christ the increase of sanctification a greater measure of dying to sinne a greater care to liue in newnes of life q what if a man after the receiuing of the sacrament neuer finde any such thing in himselfe a hee may well suspect himselfe whether he did euer repent or not q what is another meanes of increasing faith a praier q what is praier a john a familiar speach with god tim philipp in which either we craue things needful or giue thanks for things receiued q in asking things needfull what is required a two things an earnest desire and faith q mark what things must a christian mans heart desire a sixe things especially q what are they a petition i that he may glorifie god that ii god may raigne in his heart amp not sinne iii that he may do god will and not the lusts of his flesh iiii that he may rely himselfe on god prouidence for all the meanes of this temporall life v that he may be iustified and be at peace with god vi that by the power of god hee may be strengthened against all teptatios q what is faith a a amen perswasion that these things which we truly desire god will grant them for christs sake q after that a man hath led a short life in this world what followeth the a death which is the parting asunder of body and soule q why doo wicked man and vnbeleeuers die a that luke their body may goe to the earth and their soules may be cast into hell fier q why doo the godly die a that luke act thess heb corinthian their body may rest for a while in the earth amp their soules may enter into heauen immediatlie q what followeth after death a the day of iudgement q what signe is there to knowe this day from other

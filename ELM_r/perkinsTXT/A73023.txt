the prophet in the first chapter of this prophecy rebuketh the iewes of three notable crimes idolatry fraud and crueltie in this second he exhorts them to repentance and withall reproueth some of their speciall sinnes in the three first verses he propoundeth the doctrine of repentance and addeth some speciall reasons to mooue and stirre them vp to the practise of it in propounding the doctrine of repentance he directs it to two sorts of man first to the obstinate and impenitent iewes in the first and second verses secondly to the better sort of them in the third so that the summe and substance of these two first verses is a briefe and summarie propounding of the doctrine of repentance to the obstinate iewes the wordes containe in them seuerall points touching the doctrine of repentance the dutie to be performed search who must be searched your selues who must doe it the iewes who are further described to be a nation not worthy to be beloued of god these are in the first verse in the second verse the time limitting them when to repent before the decree come forth that is before god put in execution the iudgements which are already decreed amp appointed for them a forcible reason vrging them to doe it which lieth hid and is necessarily implied in the fourth point namely that there is a decree against them which wants nothing but execution which also shal come vnlesse they repent whereby they shal be fanned and if they shall be found to be chaffe they shal fly away with the winde of god iustice of all these points in order for the first the holy ghost saith search your selues the words are commonly reade thus gather your selues which though it be good for that in repentance a man gathereth himselfe and all his wits together which afore were dispersed amp wandred vp amp down in vanity yet i rather allow their translation who read thus search or fan your selues but either of them may stand because the word in the original doth coprehed both significations yet it seemeth that to search or sift fits this place better considring the same manner of speech is atterwards continued in the word chaffe so that the meaning of the holy ghost seemeth to bee this search try and fanne your selues least you bee found light chaffe and so fly away and be consumed before the iustice of god concerning this duty of searching let vs obserue first that the holy ghost vrging the iewes to repent vseth not the word repentance but bids them search themselues yet meaning hee would haue them to repent giuing vs to vnderstand that no man can haue true and sound repentance but hee who hath first of all searched and examined himselfe and this stands with good reason for no man can repent who first of all doth not know himselfe and his owne wretchednesse but no man can see into himselfe nor knowe himselfe but hee that doth diligently search himselfe so that the beginning of all grace is for a man to search and try and fanne himselfe that thereby he may knowe what is in himselfe that so vpon the search seeing his fearefull and damnable estate hee may forsake himselfe amp his owne waies and turne to the lord thus speaketh the holy ghost in the heartes of holy man let vs search and try our waies and make what followeth and turne againe to the lord as though there were no turning againe to the lord but after a searching of our selues with this testimonie of the holy ghost agreeth the testimonie of al holy mens consciences who all knowe that the first beginning of their turning to the lord was a searching of themselues let any repentant sinner aske his conscience and call to minde his first calling and conuersion and he will remember that the first thing in his repentance was this that he searched into himselfe and looked narrowly into his waies and finding his waies dangerous and his case fearefull did thereupon resolue to take a new course and turne to the lord for pardon and mercie and for grace to enter into more holy and more comfortable courses the man that passeth vpon ridges of mountains and sides of hils or that goeth ouer a narrow bridge or some dangerous and steepe rockes at midnight feareth not because hee seeth no daunger but bring the same man in the morning and let him see the narrowe bridge he went ouer in the night vnder which runnes a violent streame and a bottomlesse gulfe and the daungerous mountaines and rocks he passed ouer and he will wonder at his owne boldnesse and shrinke for feare to thinke of it and will by no meanes venter the same way againe for now hee seeth the height of the mountaines the steepnesse of the hilles the cragginesse of the rockes the fearsul downfall and the furious violence of the streame vnderneath amp therby seeth the extreame daunger which afore he saw not therfore he wondreth amp reioy oth that he hath escaped so great a da nger and will by no meanes be drawn to goe that way in the day which hee went most carelesly in the darkenesse of the night but seeketh another way though it should be far about so a sinner in his first estate which is naturall and corrupt as wee are bredde and borne hath a vaile before his face so that hee seeth nothing the wrath of god and the curse due for sinne hell and damnation seeking to deuoure him he seeth them not although liuing alwaies in sinne hee walketh in the very iawes of hell it selfe and because he seeth not this fearefull daunger therefore hee refuseth no sinne at all but rusheth securely into all maner of sinne the night of impenitencie and the myst of ignorance so blinding his eyes that he seeth not the narrow bridge of this life from which if he slide he falles immediatly into the bottomlesse p t of hell but when as god spirit hath by the light of god word opened his eyes amp touched his heart to consider his estate then hee seeth the fraile bridge of this narrow life and how little a sleppe there is between him and damnation then hee seeth hell open due for his sinnes and himselfe in the high way to it sinne being the craggy rocke and hell the gaping gulfe vnder it this life being the narrowe bridge and damnation the streame which runneth vnder it then hee wondreth at his miserable estate admireth the mercie of god in keeping him from falling into the bottome of hell wondreth at the presumptuous boldnesse of his corruption which so securely plodded on towards destruction and being ashamed of himselfe and these his waies he turnes his heart to the god that saued him from these daungers and sets himselfe into more holy wayes and more comfortable courses and confesseth that ignorance made him bold and blindnesse made him so presumptuous but now hee seeth the daunger and will by no meanes goe the same way againe and thus the searching and seeing into the foulnesse of sinne and the daunger thereof is the first beginning of repentance and the first step into grace this doctrine teacheth vs what faith and repentance is generall in the world all man say they beleeue and haue repented long agoe but trie it well and we shall finde in the bodie of our nation but a lippe faith and a sippe repentance for euen when they say so they are blinde and ignorant of their owne estate amp know not themselues but presume of themselues that because they are baptized and liue in the church therefore they are in god fauour and in very good estate when as they neuer yet were recociled to god and are so farre from it that they neuer yet saw any sinnes in themselues wherof they shuld repent as a man trauelling in the night seeth no daunger but plods on without feare so the most part of our common people in the night of their ignorance think and presume they loue and feare god and loue their neighbour and that they haue euer done so nay it is the common opinion that a man may do so by nature and that hee is not worthy to liue who doth not loue god with all his heart and beleeue in iesus christ but alas poore simple soules they neuer knewe what sinne was neuer searched nor saw into theirown harts with the light of god lawe for if they had they should haue seene such a sea of corruption that then they would confesse it to bee the hardest thing in the world to loue god and to beleeue in christ and for sake sinne it is therefore manifest that they haue not yet begun to beleeue or repent nor haue entred into the first step of grace which leadeth to repentance for that they haue not learned this lesson which the prophet teacheth that is to search themselues furthermore let vs in the second place obserue better the signification of the word it signifieth to search narrowly as a man would doe for a piece of gold or a p cious iewell which is lost in a great house or as a man may search for gold in a myne of the earth where is much earth and but very little gold oare hence wee may learne that in true repentance and conuersion we must not search so only as to find the grosse and palpable sinnes of our liues but so as we may finde those sinnes which the world accounts less sinnes and espie our secret faults amp priuy corruptions some corruptions see memore neere a kinne to our nature and therein man hope to be excused when they forsake many other greater sins but a true penitent sinner must search for such so as a good magistrate searcheth for a lurking which is into some close and secret corner and he must ranfack his heart for such corruptions as wherein his heart takes special delight and must thanke that no sinne can be so small but it is too great to be spared and that euery sinne great or litle must be searched for as being all tray to god maiestie but alas the practise the world is farre otherwise great sinnes are little sinnes little sinnes are no sinnes nay after a little custome great sinnes are also little or nothing and so at last man make no bones of grosse and grieuous sins and for the most part man search so superficially that they scarse finde any thing to be sinne such excuses are made such distinctios are deuised such mittigations such qualifications such colours are cast vppon all sinnes as now vp and downe the world grosse sins are called into question whether they be sins or no and the great transgressions of the lawe are counted small matters necessarie euils or inconueniences tollerated to auoyd other euils and what is he counted but a curious and a precise foole which stands vpon them ignorance after fiue and thirtie yeares preaching is counted no sinne blind deuotion in god seruice no sin lippe labour in praying vaine and customable swearing mocking of religion and the professors thereof no sin prophaning of the saboath contemning of preachers abusing of parents no sinnes pride in apparel superfluitie in meates beastly and ordinarie drunkennes fornication no sinnes nay decites cosonages oppressing vsury notorious briberie and couetousnes that mother sinne these are counted no sinnes these beames are made but moates by prophane man amp they are so minced and carued or there is some such necessitie of them or some such other flourish or vernish must be cast vpon the as that they are little or none at all alas alas is not that a simple amp a silly search where such blockes as these are lye vnspied what are moulehils when such mountaines are not seene moates will be little regarded where such beames are not discerned but it is cleare that therefore there is no true trial nor diligent search made for a true conuert will search his heart for all and wil spare none he deales in searching his owne heart as a good iustice of peace in searching for traytors or seminarie priests he seekes not superficially but most exactly and leaueth neuer a corner vnsought and he thinkes great sinnes to be infinite and little sinnes great and iudgeth no sinne so small but that it deserueth the anger of god amp therefore he wonders at the mercy of god which throwes vs not al downe to hel in a moment amp he crieth out with holy ieremie it is the lord mercie that we are not consumed away then with this superficial amp hypocritical search where so many sinnes are spared and not found out it is pharisaical for euen so the pharisie when hee came into the temple to recken with god and to tell what traytours hee had found that is what sinnes vpon good search hee had espied he returnes his precept all is well he hath found neuer a one but beginnes to thanke god that he was so good and so good and not so il and so il nor yet like the publicane the world is full of pharisies not onely the popish church but euen our church swarms with these superficial searchers who cannot because they will not finde any sinnes to present vnto god man thinke in the country a church officer hazards his oath if he present all well and findeth no fault in his parish to present as punishable to the ordinary for man thinke it vnpossible that there should bee none in a whole parish then how doth that man hazard his own soule who being made ouerseer amp searcher of his heart findes nothing in it to present to the lord for it is not more easie to espie outward amp actual trasgessions in a whole parish then it is to finde a heape of corruptions in a mans heart if a man will search into the bottome of it with the light of god law therefore when the lord comes and keepes his visitation what shal become of such a man but to vndergoe the strict and seuere search of the almightie because hee would not search himselfe our bodyes and liues are free from spanish inquisition which is one of the last props which sathan hath lent the pope wherewith to vphold his declining kingdom and the lord grant we may be euer free from it but in the meane time that might put vs in mind how to deale with our corrupt hearts and vnmortified affections euen to erect an inquisition ouer them to lay in waite for them to search them narrowly and to vse them roughly yes to set our hearts vpon the rack of god law that so it may confesse the secret wickednesse of it for the papistes doe not thinke vs protestant greater enemy to their superstition then the inward corruptions of our hearts are to our saluation therefore it may bee a godly pollicie for euery man curn to erect an inquisition ouer his owne heart and conscience and not to spare his most secret and dearest sinnes and such as are neerest allyed to his owne nature for that is the true search here commaunded by the prophet and practised by all godly and holy man when a man purposeth to finde al that are amp to espie eue al his sins for a godly man is neuer satisfied in his search but still the more he findes he suspects the more are stil behind and therefore hee continueth searching his owne heart all his life long therefore let euery professor looke to it between god and his conscience that he dally not with himselfe in ths case for if he doe then when god comes with his priuie search his hypocrisie shall bee discouered and his nakednesse shall be layd open in the view of man and angels to his eternal confusion thirdly search saith the prophet but not so content he forceth it againe euen search you in thus repeating and vrging this exhortation the holy ghost giues them and vs to vnderstand that the true searching of a mans heart and life is a duty of a great moment and special necessitie therefore he leaues it not after once naming it but inforceth it the second time as being no matter of indifferency but of great necessitie thereby shewing that it is a principal dutie in repentance euen the beginning and foundation of all true grace and further it is a meanes also to preuent god iudgements for when man search not themselues then god sendes the fire of afflictions and crosses to trie and search them but when they search themselues then god spareth to search them by his iudgements now in that this dutie of searching is both the beginning of all true grace and the meane to stay god iudgements and therefore is so pithely and forceably vrged by the holy ghost it must teach vs all a necessarie lesson namely to make great conscience of searching our selues first because god hath so commanded and we are to make conscience of obedience to euery commandement secondly because therby we shal reape two so great commodity as first thereby we shal lay a sure foundatio for the good work of grace in vs and secondly shall stay the hand of god and his iudgements from being executed vpon vs let vs therefore hearken to this counsaile of the holy ghost let vs take the fan of the lawe and therewith search and winnowe our hearts and liues our hearts for secret and hidden corruptions our liues for committing of evil and omitting of good doe with your hearts as man doe with their wheate they will not suffer their corne to lie long in the chaffe least the chaffe hurt it but commits it to the fanne that the winde may separate them so the graces of god in our hearts are pure corne our sinnes and corruptions are chaffe looke well and thou shalt finde in thy selfe much chaffe and but little corne let not then the chaffe lye too long mingled with the corne lest it corrupt the corne let not thy sinnes lye mingled with the grace of god in thee if thou doe they will choake it in the end and so depriue thee of all grace therfore rippe vp thy heart and looke into thy life and when thou hast sinned enter into thy selfe aske thy conscience what thou hast done amp be not quiet till thou hast found out thy sin and the foulenesse of it and neuer thinke that thou knowest any thing in religion till thou knowest what is in thine owne heart and what are thy special and priuiest corruptions and looke into thine owne faults not with a partial eye but with a censorious and a strait iudgement spare sin in no man but especially condemne it in thy selfe but alas these times of ours cry out of an other state for euen ieremies case is ours we may complaine as hee did no man repents him of his wickednesse saying what haue i done the same is the sore of our people and the sicknesse of all nation that euery man runnes on in his sinnes from sinne to sinne carelesly euen as the barde horse into the battaile but how rare a thing is it to find a man that dayly searcheth himself amp examines how he liues and how the case standeth between god and himselfe and that when hee hath done amisse entereth into the closet of his heart and strikes himselfe vpon the breast and disputes the case with himselfe saying what hane i done o what is this that i haue done against god against his church and against my owne soule the want of this is that which the prophet complaines of in that place not as though it were sufficient thus to doe in a mans owne conscience but because it is a good beginning and a step to further grace for if a man did seriously thus deale with his conscience after his sinne his conscience would shape him such an aunswere and would tell him so roundly what hee had done that hee would take heede how hee did the same againe and looke more narrowly and warily to himselfe all the dayes of his life seeing therefore it is so necessarie a dutie let euery one of vs indeuour the practise of it namely to rippe and ransacke our hearts and to search our wayes vnto the bottome now for your better instruction and furtherance in the performance hereof you must know that this search is to be made by the lawe of god for nothing els but god law can helpe vs amp let vs see y t which we must search for for if wee search by any other means we may seek amp search long enough ere we find any thing that wil be matter of repentance aske the diuel he will tell thee all is well amp that thou article in an excellent estate and god loues thee and thou article sure of heauen this song the diuell alwayes sings for the most part til a man comes to die for then hee appeares in his colours but till then hee laboures to sing and lull all man a sleepe in the cradle of securitie aske our owne flesh amp our owne hearts and natures and they will answere and say that all is well and safe and that wee haue beleeued and loued and feared god all our dayes aske the world and man in the world and they will aunswere all is well and they will say further that thou article a right good fellow and article worth twentie of these curious fooles that sticke vpon points amp stand vpon circumstances as swearing and drink and good fellowshippe and gaming and such other nice and circumstanciall points thus will worldly man answere for thy prophane course is acceptable to them because thereby thou approuest the same in them nay goe further and aske all humane learning in the world and it cannot tell thee what one sinne is nor what it is to offend god so that there remaines onely the law of god the light whereof will disclose the darknesse of our hearts and the iustice whereof will reueale the vnrighteousnesse amp the peruersnesse of our natures therefore to the lawe of god must we flye to helpe vs in this search and yet for our better helpe in this dutie and that there may bee nothing wanting to that soule that seeketh god therfore we are further to know that if we will search our selues by the law profitably wee must marke three rules the truth whereof vnlesse wee know acknowledge and feele wee shall neuer see our owne estate nor profite by this search but plodde on from finne to sinne vntill wee plunge into hell the first rule is that euery man that came from adam sinned in the sinne of adam thou must therefore know that his sinne in eating the forbidden fruite was thy sinne and thou sinnedst therein as well as he though thou wast then vnborne and that thou article guiltie of it before god and must answere for it to god iustice vnlesse christ doe it for thee the reason hereof is because we are his seede amp posteritie we were the in his loynes he was the father of vs all and was not a priuate ma as we are now but a publike person the pledge of al mankind and bare the person of vs all at that time therefore what he did then hee did it for himself amp for vs what couenant god made with him was made for himselfe and vs what god promised him and he to god he promised for himselfe amp for vs what he receiued in his creation he receiued for himselfe and for vs and what he gained or lost by his fall he gained and lost for vs as for himselfe he lost the fauour of god and originall puritie therefore he lost it for all his posteritie guiltinesse and god anger and corruption of nature which he gained he got for vs all as well as for himselfe if we doubt of this point it is proued by the apostle where the holy ghost saith sin entred by one man and death by sinne and that sinne went ouer all and that it went ouer all them which sinned not in the like transgression with adam that is euen our children who as they are borne are borne not onely tainted with originall corruption but guiltie also of adams sinne this is a most certaine truth though it seeme strange for fewe man thinke of it that euer they shall answer for adams sinne and therefore if any obiect what reason is there that i answere for another mans sinne i answere true if it had bene adams sinne alone but it was his and thine also for hee was thy father and stoode in thy roome and thou also since thou wast borne hast confirmed what hee did now therefore though not one of many thinkes seriously thereof namely that he should stand guilty of a sin committed more then fiue thousand yeares before he was born yet seeing it is most true both in scripture and good reason let euery man subscribe in his conscience to this truth and let this be thy first resolution in this search that thou standest guilty of adams transgression the second rule to bee knowne is that in euery man are all sinnes more plainly that in euery man by nature are the seedes of all sinnes and that not in the worst but in the best natured man make choyse of the best man and the greatest sinne and that worst sinne is to be found in that best man if any doubt of this let him consider what originall sinne is namely a corruption of the powers of our soules and that not of some or in part but of all and wholy this corruption hath two parts first a want not of some but of all good inclination a want of all goodnesse secondly a deprauation amp pronenesse not to some but to all euill and not a pronenesse onely but originall sin infuseth into euery mans heart the seed of all corruption many man stand much vpon their good meaning and vpright heart and bragge of a good nature but they are foulely deceiued for take the ciuilest man vpon the earth and the seed of all sins in the world are in him by nature but to explaine this point fully obserue these two clauses first i say not the practise of all sinnes but the seedes for all man practise not all sinne the seedes are in their nature but the practise is restrained sometime by education sometime by good and wholesome lawes sometime the constitution of mens body deny the practise of some sinnes sometime the countrey a man dwels in or calling a man liues in keepes him from the practise of some sinnes and alwayes a generall and limitting grace of god restraines the natures of all man from running into many sinnes which hand of god if god should take away and leaue euery man to his nature wee should see that euerie man would practise any sinne in the world yes euen the greatest sinnes that euer wee heard to bee done in the world all man which knowe themselues knowe this to be true and the more a man knowes his owne heart the more he seeth that his heart is a sea of all wickednesse amp that it is the mercy and grace of god that hee hath not fallen into the mightiest amp most monstrous sinnes in the world secondly i say by nature for i know by good education amp by grace it is otherwise grace rectifieth nature but that is no thankes to nature for it is as euill and corrupt still being seuered from grace and therefore nature must be fully abolished afore man come to heauen and yet though all this be true i say not that sin breakes out in all natures alike though all natures be alike corrupt for the course of nature is restrained in some more then others by the meanes aforesaid but this is the truth that whereas some are not so angry some not so wanton some not so cruel some not so couetous som not so ambitious ampc as others that comes not from any goodnesse of nature in them aboue the other originally but from god hand which tempereth restraineth and moderateth euery mans nature as he seeth good and if god did not thus moderate amp restraine the natures of man but suffer them to breake out to the full there would then be no order but all confusion in the world therefore as especially for his churches quietnesse so also for the preseruatio of publike peace and the vpholding of societie in the world betweene man and man the lord holdes a hand ouer euery mans nature and keepes euery one in a certaine compasse limitted by the wisdom of his power which restraining hand of his if the lord should take away all societies and common wealths would be turned vpside downe because euery man by the vniuersall corruption of his nature would breake out into euery sinne i ende this point with appealing to the testimonie of the consciences of all man and especially of the best and holiest man of whom i would aske this question whether they find not in their natures an inclination euen to the foulest sinnes in the world if shame or feare or else the grace of god restrained them not so that the best man doe knowe well enough what adoe they haue with their corrupt natures to keepe them within the compasse of obedience nay i yet adde further the nature of man and of all man is so corrupt since adam that euen the seede of the sinne against the holy ghost and a pronenesse to it is in the nature of euery man though not one man amongst many thousandes doe commit that sinne for seeing in that sinne there is a heape or sea of all sinnes gathered together hee therefore that hath in his nature the seede of all sinnes hath also the seede of it and againe seeing all euill tendes to a perfection as well as grace doth what reason therefore is there but wee may safely thinke that the diuell would hale euery one to that height of sinne if it were not that the powerfull hand of god preuented him who will neither suffer wicked man nor the diuell himselfe to bee so wicked as they could and would be the vse of this second rule is notable for in this searching of our selues it sheweth vs what wee are without all colours or deceit and fully discouers vnto vs the vglinesse of our natures and it may teach vs all how to think and esteeme of our selues when we heare of caines vnnaturall murther pharohs vnnatural crueltie the sodomits vnnatural lust achitophles diuilish pollicy senacheribs horrible blasphemie iudas monstrous treason iulians fearefull apostacie when we heare of the fearefull murders treasons periuties sinnes against nature blasphemies apostacies witchcrafts and other the horrible sinnes of the world let vs then returne into our selues amp looke homewards euen into our owne hearts and confesse euery one that these should haue bene euen thy sinnes also if god grace had not preuented thee this will humble thee and make thee thinke vilely amp basely of thy selfe and so consequently bring thee to repentance and true amendment and the very reason why man repent not nor amend their waies is because they are pharisies by nature and thinke highly of themselues and of their owne natures and their naturall inclinations this will be a harsh and a strange doctrine to them oh they haue excellent natures and they cannot indure such and such sinnes and they thanke god they are not as ill as others but let all such man knowe they must cease magnifying nature and learne to magnifie god grace let them knowe that nature in them is in the roote as much corrupt as in the worst man in the world and euery mans heart is a bottomlesse fountaine of all sinne therefore praise not thy nature but god grace and mercy in giuing thee so good a nature or rather so well restraining and rectifying thy nature and stay not there but desire of the lord that as he hath giuen thee a better tempered nature the to other man so also he would bestowe on thee his speciall and sauing grace and as he hath kept thee from the feareful sins of others thou being as ill naturally as they so he would also lead thee into the way of saluation which else the best nature in the world can neuer attaine vnto the third rule to be known and practised by him who will truly search himselfe is that euery man borne of adam is by nature the child of wrath and god enimie this is true of all without exception high or low rich or poore noble or simple borne in the visible church or without and further by being enemy of god he is therefore borne subiect to hell to damnation and to all other curses so that looke as a traytour conuicted stands therby in his princes high displeasure and is sure of death without speciall pardon so stands euery man when he is borne conuicted of high treason against god in his high disfauour and is in daunger of hell which is the fulfilling of the wrath of god thus dauid confesseth of himselfe i was borne in iniquitie and in sinne hath my mother conceined me if in sinne then in god wrath and vnder the danger of damnation if any aske how or why this is so i answere the truth as also the equitie of this third rule depends on the two former for because euery man is borne guiltie of adams great sinne and also tainted originally with all corruption amp a pronnesse to all sin therefore it followeth in equitie and iustice that euery man is borne vnder the wrath and curse of god this point is a plaine and euident truth yet man in the world thinke not so and it is the cause why man repent not of their sinnes for most man thinke that by nature they are in god fauour and therfore they neede not to sue for it in humiliation and repentance but onely liue ciuily and do no open wrong and all is well whereas alas there is no condemned traytour more out of his princes fauour nor more sure of death without a pardon then al we are out of god fauour and sure of damnation vnlesse we procure god fauour again by faith and repentance for the better opening of this third rule and the manifesting of the truth let vs know further that the curse of god vnder the which we are all borne is three fould the first is a bondage vnder sathan it is a certaine truth that euery man as he is borne of his parents and till hee repent is a slaue of sathan man or woman high or low sathan is his lord and maister hee sittes as iudge in his heart and in this sence sathan is the king of the nation and god of the world man will in wordes defie sathan and not name him without defiance and spitte at him and yet alas hee is in their hearts they spit him out of their mouthes but hee is lower they should also spitte him out of their hearts and that is true defiance indeede for alas hee lodgeth in thy heart and there he makes his throne and raignes vntill the spirit of regeneration dispossesse him and till then no servant is so subiect to his maister no slaue to his lord as is the heart of man by nature vnto sathan the prince of darknesse nay our bondage is more fearefull then the slauery of any poore christian in the spaniard or in the turkes gallies for their body are but in bondage and at commaund and vnder punishment but our best part our heart our conscience our soule it selfe is captiuated vnto him and vnder his commaunde who is the king of crueltie and confusion and lord of hell whose commaundements are iniustice whose seruice is sinne and whose hyre is damnation the second part of the curse is the first death or the death of the body that is a separation of the soule and body a sunder for a time namely till the last iudgement this death is duly and iustly the punishment of any one or the least sinne therefore how due and iust a punishment vpon that horrible heape of sinfulnesse which is in euery mans nature and it is a most terrible curse for it is the very gate of hel and the downfall to damnation vnto all man but such as by faith and repentance doe get their death sanctified by the death of christ vnto such man indeed it is no curse but a gracious and glorious blessing for it is altered by christ his death but vnto all man by nature and which repent not it is the heauy curse of god wrath and the very downfall into the gulfe of hell the thirde part of the curse vnder which euery man is borne is the second death the death of soule and bodie which is the eternall want of god presence and the accomplishment of his wrath and an apprehension and feeling of that wrath seazing on body soule and conscience the first curse was a spirituall death the death of the soule the second a temporarie death the death of the body the third is an eternall death a death both of soule and bodie together and for euer this eternall death is the curse of all curses the miserie of all miseries and torment of all torments and i shewe it thus often when thy tooth acheth and sometime when thy head acheth or in the paine of the stone or collicke thou wouldest giue all that thou hast in the world to bee eased of that paine nay in the exstremitie of some fitts many will wish them selues euen out of the world now if the paine of one tooth can so farre distemper minde and body that it cannot bee releiued with all the pleasures of this life o then what a torment shall that bee when not one kinde of paine but the whole viole of god wrath shall bee powred not on one member but on the whole soule body and conscience and that not for a time vnder hope of better but eternally without hope of release and that not in this world where there are comforts helpes and remedies but in that vgly and darksome place of torments and that not amongst liuing man which might mittigate thy paine or else bemone thee and beway leit with thee but with the diuels and damned spirits which will now laugh at thy destruction and solace themselues in this thy misery and will reioyce as thou didest serue them in earth so now in hel to be thy tormeters it may be therfore by the way good warning and wisedome to vs all when we feele the extremity of some bodily paine to consider with our selues and say o then what shall be my misery and torment if i repent not when not one member but soule bodie and conscience shall be racked and tormented in the feeling and apprehension of the anger of the lord of hostes in these three points stands that curse and wrath of god vnder which euery man is borne and these doe answer to the three degrees of sinne which are in vs for as the two first rules taught vs there is in euery man by nature till hee repent a three fold guiltinesse first a guiltinesse of adams sinne secondly the taint of originall and vniuersal corruption thirdly a pollution by many outragious actuall sinnes in the first of these euery man is equally guiltie in the second euery man is equally corrupt but in the third euery one keepes that compasse within which the lord wil keepe them by his limitting power now as in our guiltinesse of adams sinne sin hath his beginning in originall sinne his continuance in actuall sin his perfection so answerable herevnto the wrath of god which alwaies standeth opposite to sinne is begun in leauing vs by nature to the slauerie of sathan is continued by death and is accomplished in damnation and now these three rules i commend to the carefull amp christian consideration of you all certifying you from god that as you can neuer bee saued vnlesse you repent nor repent vnlesse you search your selues as here the prophet bid deth so that you can neuer search your selues aright til you bee perswaded and resolued of these three rules and of the truth of them all euen in your hearts and consciences namely first that thou article guiltie of adams sin secondly that thou article prone by nature to al evil in the world thirdly that for these thou article subiect to the wrath of god and to all the curses of his wrath but when thou article in heart amp conscience resolued that these are true then thou article a fit scholler for this lesson of the prophet search thy selfe for when thou goest thus prepared vnto this search and esteemest of thy selfe as these three rules haue described thee then if thou search into thy selfe thou wilt finde thy selfe and thy estate to be such as will cause thee to repent returne and take a new course therefore what the prophet sayd to those iewes i say vnto you also my brother of this realme of england who are here now gathered together out of so many country amp quarters of this realme yes in the name of the same god i cry vnto you search o search your selues and thinke it not a matter indifferent to do or not to doe it but know it that god commandes you as euer you will come to saluation search your selues and the rather because by these three rules you see how much chaffe of corruption is in your nature and what neede therefore it hath to bee searched into and fanned by repentance bee well assured thou man whatsoeuer thou article there is so much chaffe in thee that if thou search not and fanne it not out thou wilt proue nothing but chaffe at the last day and so be blown away with the winde of god iustice into hell take hold therefore of this exhortation and deferre it not thou wilt not suffer thy wheate to lye too long in the chaffe for feare of hurting it is it then safe to suffer the chaffe of thy sinnes and corruptions to lie cankering and rotting in thy heart bee sure that that little portion of grace which thou attainest vnto by liuing in the church and vnder the ministrie of the word of god will bee putrifyed and cleane corrupted with the chaffe of thy sinnes therefore againe and againe i exhort you to make conscience of this dutie search into your selues fanne out this chaffe this presumption of ours and high esteeming of our owne nature and conceits of god fauour before wee haue it that so this chaffe being blowne away the lord may then bestow vpon vs foundnesse of grace amp the foundation of al goodnes which is a holy amp humbled heart salnation is such a building as the foundation thereof had need to be sure and strong ignorance blindnesse and presumption are not sufficient foundations for such a building therefore as no man wil build a strong house vpon any earth but will first search it least it prooue sandie amp so ouerthrow all so a wise christian will not build his saluation vpon fancies amp conceits and naturall presumptions but will search and looke into his heart and finding these to be sandie and rotten and therefore too weake for the foundation of so glorious a building wil refuse them all and labour to furnish his heart with such sound grace as whervpon he may trust so weighty a work as is the saluation of his soule againe if thou wilt stand in the day of triall then search thy heart betime and discerne between chaffe amp wheat thou seest that chaffe flyeth away before the wind but good corne indures the fan and the furie of the wind so in the day of triall temptation sicknesse or open persecution the chaffe of natural presumption and outward formalitie in religion wil flye away and it must be the penitent humbled and beleeuing heart which must then abide it out and endure the fanne of temptations and persecutions and to conclude let not the diuell deceiue thee in making thee imagine or hope to please god and yet to let thy corruptions lie vnseene and thy sins vnsearched out least thereby thou marre all for thou vsest not to lay vp wheat in thy garners vntil it be purged from the chaffe so thinke not to store vp any sauing knowledge or any other grace of god in thy heart vntill the chaffe of vanitie be first blowne away that so the holy graces of god may be layd vp in the garners of thy soule and therefore questionlesse to speake one word to touch our common professors in the very sore of their soule al knowledge that is stored vp in these impure and vnsearched hearts is euen as wheat layd vp in the chaffe which is a thousand to one sure to bee eaten vp by the chaffe so that when the winnowing time of tryall and persecution comes i feare that such man will for al their knowledge shrinke aside and betray the truth there knowledge then prouing no better then chaffe because it was layde vp in an vnholy heart if therefore thou wouldest stand and endure when popery or persecution or temptations come if thou wouldest abide the furie of the fanne of temptations now then exercise thy heart with the fanne of god law search and ransacke it purge out the chaffe of corruption and store vp knowledge in an holy heart and a good conscience and that will abide the violence of all temptations yes when god suffers the diuell to doe with vs as he did with peter to winnow vs like wheate to sift and trie vs as he did iob with the furious winde of all his mallice this knowledge will proue wheate that will abide the winde and gold that will abide the fire thus glorious will it be in the ende if we follow this holy prophets councel and search our hearts and thus much for the first point namely the dutie of searching heere commanded in which wee haue stayed the longer because it is the foundation of all the rest and this being wel laid the whole building wilt goe vp the faster now we come to the second general point here laid down that is whom must we search the prophet aunswereth your selues not other me but your selues this search so vrged and inforced by the prophet must not be of other mens hearts and liues but of our owne our owne are our charge and not other mens and therein is the saying true which else is most false euery man for himselfe for as euery soule must bee saued by it selfe so must it beleeue repent and search it selfe the dutie therefore here commanded is for euery man that would haue his soule to be saued to search it and reforme it and leaue others to bee searched by themselucs here the holy ghost meetes with the common corruption of this world and that is that man are eagle eyed to see into the liues of other man but to looke into their owne hearts and liues they are blinder then moles they can see moates in other mens liues but discerne not beames in their owne wherby it comes to passe that they stumble and fall fowly for the eies of most man are set vpon others amp not vpon them selues and thereupon it is that an evil man seeing other man amp not himselfe thinkes best of himselfe amp worst of other man but contrariwise a good man seeing himselfe amp not other man thinkes worst of himselfe and better of other man an evil man lookes outward and iudgeth other man but a good ma lookes homeward amp iudgeth himselfe and in iudging condemnes himselfe farre aboue other man and that because by searching into his own heart and wayes hee knowes that by himselfe which he knowes not by any man in the world besides so then we must search not other man but our selues our owne hearts and our owne liues are our charge and burthen the liues of other man concerne vs not being priuate me further the either to follow them being good or take heede of them being evil but to search or to bee inquisitiue into them is no dutie commaunded vs but rather a foule amp a base vice forbidden of god indeede magistrates in their people pastours in their congregations and house holders in their families are to search but they can search onely for criminall causes or open actuall sinnes but this searching must bee of our hearts which no man can search but our selues onely few man haue a calling to enquire into other mens liues but euery man hath a calling to search into himselfe but alas man doe farre otherwise they suffer themselues to rotte in their owne sinnes and erect an inquisition ouer other mens liues amp it is to be seene in dayly experience that those man who are the great searchers and priers into other man are the neglecters and forgetters of themselues and contrariwise they who doe narrowly search themselues and their owne wayes and looke into the corners of their owne hearts doe finde so much worke to do with themselues that they little busie themselues with other man and thus much may suffice for that point it followeth o nation not worthy to be beloued the third point who must search the iewes who are here termed a nation not worthy to be beloued amp yet for al that they are bid to search themselues that so vpon their repentance they might bee beloued where wee may see the vnspeakable loue of god and his wonderfull mercie offer grace vnto such man as are altogether vnworthy of it god children are by nature like other man and god findes nothing in them why to respect them aboue others but euen of his owne mercie makes them worthy who of themselues are not therefore how worthy is that god to haue all the loue of our hearts who loued vs when wee were not worthy to be beloued but let vs examine more particularly why god doth call the iewes a nation not worthy to bee beloued i answere god had blessed them aboue other nation he gaue them his couenant of grace and thereby made them his people amp commited to their trust his holy word and oracles but he delt not so with other nation neither had the heathe knowledge of his lawes besides all this they had a better land then others about them it flowed with milke and honie that is with all commodity amp delights and though their country was but little yet themselues so populous and so powrefull that whilest they pleased god no enemie durst set vppon them thus for soule and bodie they were euery way a nation blessed of god a people beloued of god aboue all others now how did this people thus beloued of their god requite this his loue which they had no more deserued then any other nation certainly as they deserued it not afore they had it so they requited it not when they had it but requited this loue of god with sinne with rebellion and with disobedience they tempted him they prouoked him to wrath they presumed of his mercy amp proued a most stubborne and stifnecked people a froward generation moses partly sawe this in his owne experience amp better discerned it in the spirit of prophesie and therefore wondering at this their wickednes he cryed out do you thus requite the lord o foolish people amp vnwise thus that is with sin amp disobedience which is the only meanes to displease the lord amp to prouoke him to wrath for this cause they are worthily called a foolish and vnkind people by moses and here by the prophet a nation not worthy to bee beloued namely for their vnthankefulnes and vnkindnes which was such as they not only were slacke and carelesse in performance of such duties as god required but euen multiplyed their sinnes amp committed those foule rebellions which his soule hated and amongst many the prophet here in this chapter noteth three of their great sinnes for which they were a nation not worthy to bee beloued couetousnesse crueltie and deceite all which were the more hainous and intollerable because they were the sins of their princes their rulers and their priests who should haue beene lights and examples to the rest now although euery sin in it selfe is of that ill desert as it is able to cast vs out of god fauour and depriue vs of his loue yet behold here god complaines not vpon a little cause but for wonderfull amp exceeding vnthankfulnesse amp vnkindnesse in them who of all other should haue loued the lord as a man cares not for hard vsage from him whome hee esteemes not but a little vnkindnesse doth greatly greiue a man from him who is loued and respected so is it with the lord our god he loued not the gentiles as hee did the iewes neither was hee so bountifull vnto them and therefore as we may see though they liued alwayes in ignorance and continued alwayes in disobedience yet the text saith the time of that ignorance god regarded not but when as the iewes his owne people whome he chose out of all people amp bestowed his loue vpon them and made his couenant of grace with the when they became vnkinde vnthankfull forgetfull stubborne and rebellious that caused the lord euen to complaine of the indignitie and to cry out by moses doe yee thus requite the lord o foolish people amp vnwise and hereby the prophet o nation not worthy to be beloued amp therfore ther is no man but if he be asked what he thinkes of this nation of the iewes he will answere that they are a most vile amp wicked people a froward generation and that they are worthy to taste deepely of all god plagues who so farre abused his loue and mercie but what doth this belong to them alone and is israel onely a nation not worthy to be beloued nay i may cry out with as good cause o england a nation not worthy to be beloued for god hath beene as good a god to vs as he was to them and we haue beene as vnkinde a people to him as they were to him but that i may bee free from discrediting our nation and from defiling my owne nest let vs prooue both these points and lay them open to the view of the world first therefore the same mercies and farre greater haue beene powred amp heaped vpon vs hee hath called vs out of the darknesse first of heathenisme amp then of popery his couenant of grace and saluation he hath confirmed with vs his treasures of his word and sacraments hee hath imparted to vs his holy word neuer better preached and the mysteries thereof neuer more plainly opened since the time of the apostles and as wee haue religion so wee haue it vnder a religious prince whereby it comes to passe that these blessings of saluation wee inioy not in secret or by stealth but wee haue it countenanced by authoritie so that religion is not barely allowed but euen as it were thrust vpon man besides al this wee haue a land also that floweth with milke amp hony it is plentifull in all good things we haue libertie amp peace vnder a peaceable prince and the companions of peace prosperitie plentie health wealth corne woole gold siluer abundance of all things that may please the heart of man thus hath god deserued the loue of england but now england how hast thou requited this kindnesse of the lorde certainely euen with a greater measure of vnkindnesse that is with more and greater sinnes then euer israell did so that if moses spake true of them then may our moses much more truly cry out against england doest thou thus requite the lord thou foolish people and if this prophet said thus of israell for three sins then may it bee saide of england for sinnes o england a nation not worthie to bee beloued for thou hast multiplyed thy transgressions aboue theirs of israell euen as though thou haddest resolued with thy selfe the more god kindnesse is heaped on thee the more to multiply thy sinnes against him for thou england as thou hast requited the lord with sinnes so not with a few sinnes or small sinnes or sinnes which hardly coulde haue bene preuented for that had bene a matter of some excuse or not of so great complaint but thy sinnes are many and grieuous and capitall and which is worst of all wilfull and affected euen as though god had deserued euill of vs and that therefore we ought malitiously to requite him if any man make doubt of this and therefore thinke i speake too hardly of our church i will then deale plainly and particularly and rip vp the sores of our nation that so they may bee healed to the bottome the common sins of england wherwith the lord is requited are these first ignorance of god will and worship i speake not of that compelled ignorance in many corners of our land which is to bee pittied because they want the meanes but wilfull and affected ignorance man are ignorant euen because they will bee ignorant meanes of knowledge were neuer so plentifull and yet neuer more grosse ignorance is not hee wilfully blinde who will not open his eyes in the light and can there bee any darknesse at noone day but it must bee wilfull but our nation is darke and blinde in the sunshine of the gospell and grossely ignorant when the gospell beates their eares and light shines round about them so as if they closed not their eyes and stopped not their eares they could not but both heare amp see who would looke for ignorance after yeares preaching amp yet many are as ignorant as if they had bin borne amp brought vp vnder popery so that our people are as euill as those in the dayes of christ of whom the holy ghost saith light is come into the world but man loue darknesse more then light so knowledge is come into england but many englishman loue ignorance better then knowledge alas how many thousands haue we in our church who know no more in religio then they heare in common talke of al man amp which is worse they thinke it sufficient also and which is worst of all whereas they might haue more they will not but care not for it the second maine sin of england is contempt of christian religion religion hath bin among vs these fiue and thirtie yeares but the more it is published the more it is contemned and reproached of many in so much as there is not the simplest fellow in a country town who although he knowes not one point of religion yet he can mock and scorne such as are more religious then himself is this is one of the moaths of england that eates vp religion this is grieuous in whomsoeuer but most intollerable in two sorts of man first in them who are altogether ignorant that they should mocke they know not what a pittifull thing to hear one who himselfe cannot giue the meaning of one petition in the lord praier to vpbraide other man because they are too forward but it is the worst of all when man of knowledge and such as liue ciuilly and would be counted good christians and are indeede of the better sort cannot abide to see others go a little before them but if they doe presently they are hypocrites and dissemblers thus not prophanenesse nor wickednesse but euen religion it selfe is a by word a mocking stocke and matter of reproach so that in england at this day the man or woman that begins to professe religion and to serue god must resolue with himselfe to sustaine mockes and iniuries euen as though he liued among the enimies of religion and not among professors and as religion increaseth and spreadeth it selfe so doth the number of these mockers o what a cursed sinne is this to contemne the greatest fauour that god can giue vs that is his holy religion for the which wee should rather praise him all the dayes of our liues all that god can giue a man in this world is his gospell what then can god giue to be regarded when his gospel is contemned this sinne was neuer amongst the iewes they indeed regarded it not so as it deserued but who did euer make a mocke and a scorne of it but england o england how canst thou answere this god sends thee the most precious iewell that he can send to a nation and thou scornest it and them that bring i and them that receiue it euen as though it were no blessing but a curse so that as christ saith to the iewes for which of my good workes doe you stone mee so may the lord say to england i haue giuen thee a fruitfull land a blessed prince gold and siluer peace and libertie plentie and prosperitie for which of these o england doest thou contemne my religion the least of these deserue loue but england hath a better then all these that is his gospell and word of saluation and yet that also is contemned as beeing nothing worth and those which confesse it and those that bring it and consequently god himselfe that gaue it if england had no more sinnes but this this deserues that it should bee saide of vs that wee are a nation vnworthy to bee loued aboue all nation for some nation would haue religion that they might loue it but they cannot haue it some haue it and doe loue it some haue it and loue it not but in noe nation is it made a mocking stocke but in england and where are those man but in england who like the dog in the manger will neither entertaine religion themselues nor suffer them that would let vs in time take heede of this sinne as a sinne that crieth to god to reuenge so vile a dishonour done to his maiesty neither is there any sinne that more certainly foreshewes and more forceably hastens the remouing of the gospell from vs for high time is it to cease louing wher loue procures disdaine and to stay giuing where giftes are scorned carry home this lesson to your great townes amp cities where you dwel for in these populous places are these great mockers for wher god hath his professors the diuel hath his mockers amp repet betimes of this sin for hold on in mocking amp be sure that god who will not be mocked will remoue his gospel fro you but if you leaue this sin and entertaine the gospel as it worthily deserus then be sure of it god will continue the gospell to you and your posterities after you in the face of al your enemy round about you the third common sinne of englande is blasphemie many waies but especially in vaine swearing false swearing and forswearing and the abuse of all the names and tytles of the lord god this sinne is general euen ouer the whole land especially in fayres and markets where man for a little gaine wil not care to cal the lord of hostes to be witnesse to a lye and the god of truth to testifie an vntruth and which is worst of all god holy name is vsed in vaine oathes and ordinarie talke when man haue no cause to sweare at all so that it is most lamentable to see and obserue that the name of any man of honour or worship is vsed more reuerently and lesse abused then that fearefull and glorious name the lord our god the fourth generall and great sinne is prophanation of the saboath a common sinne euery where and yet so great a sinne that where it raignes in that country congregation family man or woman there is noe feare of god nor any true grace in them for the keeping of the saboath is the maintaining increasing and publishing of religion the fift sinne of our nation is vniust dealing in bargaining between man and man how hard is it to finde an honest simple plaine dealing man and that euen in such great assemblies as this is i feare present experience wil testifie you are now many thousands gathered together some to buy some to sell some to exchange remember that i haue tolde you an honest hearted and plaine dealing man is hard to finde therfore labour to approue your selues sincere hearted man remember the counsell of the holy ghost let no man oppresse nor defraude his brother in bargaining for the lord is the auenger of all such things these sinnes are generall and vniuersall as a cancker and so are the sinnes of the and commandements though they be not altogether so comon as these be murthers adulteries vsuries briberies extorsions cousenages they are a burthen vnder which our earth groanes and they cry against vs to heauen so that vpon as good or much beter cause may it be said to vs as to the iewes o nation not worthy to be beloued looke at the outward face of our church at the signes of god loue which are amongst vs and at god dealing with vs and behold we are a most beautifull church a glorious nation a nation to bee admired and wondred at but looke at the liues of our ordinarie professors looke at our sinnes and at our requiting of god loue and we are a people of sodome as full of iniquities as they were whose sinnes are so many so rife and so ripe that at the last they wil eue bring down fire amp brimstone or some other strange iudgement vpon vs if repentance doe not preuent it or the cries and prayers of holy man stay not god hands so then let vs all here assembled grant amp confesse that we are a nation so farre from being worthy to bee beloued as that we are most worthy to be hated amp to haue all the wrath of god powred vpon vs now then are we so and shall wee continue so still nay that is the worst and most wretched of all then let euery one of vs learne this duty enter into our selues search our hearts and liues that they may lye open to our owne sight to the confusion of vs in our selues that in god by repentance wee may bee raised vp our sinnes lye open before the face of god and stincke in his presence and and cry for vengeance and before the face of god angels who bewaile it and before the face of the diuell who reioyceth in our confusions and shall they lye hid onely to our selues now then if wee would haue them hidde from god and stoppe the cry that they make against vs and keepe them from sathan who accuseth vs for them wee must so search our selues that they may lye open to our owne hearts remember thou thy sinnes and god will forget them lay them open before thy owne face and god will hide them from his write them vp for thy owne selfe and god will blot them out of his remembrance but if contrariwise thou hidest them then assure thy selfe the more thou hidest and buriest them the more open doe they lye in the face of god and then what will followe but that they will all bee disclosed at the last day to thy eternall confusion therefore againe and againe i exhort you in the name of god search your selues finde out your sinnes confesse them to god freely and ingeniously confesse their desert to bee hell and damnation humble your hearts to god cry and call for pardon as for life and death purpose and promise to leaue them begin a new course of life beleeue stedfastly and doubt not of pardon and forgiuenesse in the blood of christ continue in that faith and that newe course of life so may englande preuent god iudgements and quench that great action of vnkindnes which god hath against them and become a nation as worthy vpon their faith and repentance in christ to be beloued as for their peace and prosperitie they haue bene of all nation of the earth admired hitherto of the third generall point the fourth generall point in this exhortation is the time limitted them when they should search before the decree come forth ampc as though the prophet should say israell repent before god execute his iudgements on thee for behold the gratious dealing of god man sinneth his sinnes deserue plagues but god presently plagueth not but deferres it he puts a time between the sinne and the punishment ordinarily this he doth to shew his mercie to mankinde because that hee would not destroy them if they would amende therefore after the sinne he smites not presently but puttes of his punishment that in the meane time man may repent here the prophet compares the lord to a mother for as she conceiues the fruite in her wombe and beares it a long time ere she bring it out so the lord after a mans sinnes or a peoples sinnes conceiue that is ordaines and decreeth a iudgement for it but he keepes it vp and all that while he heares it but as she when her time is come then trauailes and bringes forth so when the time that god hath appointed is come and stil sinne is not repented of then his iustice trauailes to be deliuered of that iudgemet which mercy hath kept vp so long a time thus the old world had an hundred amp twentie yeares giuen them for time of repentance all that while god was in conceiuing at last when there sinnes were ripe and no hope of amendment then god trauelled and brought forth a fearefull byrth namely the vniuersall flood to wash away and take reuenge vpon the vniuersall iniquities of those times so many hundred yeares he gaue vnto the iewes long hee was in conceiuing their destruction and oftentimes hee had it at the bringing forth as in the captiuitie of babylon and vnder antioch yet his mercy stayed it and still hee trauailled longer telles them here by the prophet that yet the decree is not come forth though it bee conceiued but at last when israell would not repent but grewe worse and worse as in christ his time then hee could containe no longer but trauelled indeede and though it bee with griefe yet hee hath brought foorth and what a most fearefull byrth euen an vtter disolation of that kingdome and countrey of their citie and temple and a dispertion of their nation ouer all the world but as a woman at last is deliuered with daunger and difficultie with paine and sorrowe so the lord long conceiues but at last bringes forth his iudgements yet it is with griefe and vnwillingnesse and hee is loath as it were and much agrieued to execute his most iust iudgements on those who haue professed his name hee often touched the iewes a little and as being vnwilling to smite them hee drue backe his hande againe but at last when their sinnes did so increase and were so strong that they euen did wring out by violence his plagues from him then with much bewayling of their great misery as wee may see in christ weeping for them hee executes his iudgements on them but as they are long a comming so when they come forth they were the heauier as a child the more fulnesse of time it hath is the greater the liuelier and the stronger so god iudgements the longer god deferreth them and is in conceiuing them the heauier are they when they come that is manifest in the iewes once his owne people for he hath destroyed their land with an irrecouerable destruction and smitten their posteritie with a blindnes of minde til this houre so that to this day when the old testament is read the vaile is ouer their eies that they cannot see the light of christ iesus but plodde on in fearefull and palpable blindnesse this doctrine hath speciall vse to this our church to teach vs to looke to our selues betimes and try our owne wayes and turne to the lord for wee cannot tell how farre of his iudgments are in reason they must needs be near they haue beene so long deferred and yet beene so iustly deserued of vs certainly god hath long beene in conceiuing iudgements and plagues for the sinnes of england and often hath god hand beene vpo vs by war famine pestilence inundations and yet it hath been puld backe againe and his sword hath beene put vp into his sheath and god hath stayed his birth euen in the very trauell and we haue escaped euen as a man whose necke hath beene vpon the blocke and the axe holden vp to strike so then yet the day is not come yet we haue time happie wee that euer wee saw this day if now wee haue grace to repent and search our hearts for then wee shall stay this iudgement decreed that it shall neuer come forrth against vs but if we deferre to repent amp put off from day to day and lye rotting still in our sinnes then know and be assured that as the decree is established so it must needes come foorth and then when iudgement is come forth amp the stroke stricken repentance is too late therefore what he said to the iewes i say vnto vs search thy selfe o england a nation not worthy to be beloued before the decree come forth which is already past against thee thus much for the fourth point now followeth the last point the reason of all why should we search our selues the reason is included in the fourth point for there is a decree come forth against thee and though the execution be deferred and though god be vnwilling to take it out yet without repentance it is most certaine it shall come foorth and bee executed at the last in one word this is the reason repent or else certainely god will take vengeance but will mans heart say is this true or rather these bee but words to feare man and to keepe them in awe i aunswere for the proofe and experience hereof neuer goe further then this place and present example wee haue in hand the prophet bids them search search and repent else as certainly as there was a iudgemet conceiued so certainly it should be executed vpon the they would not heare nor search nor repent but what followed let all me iudge whether god is not true of his word to them or no yes alas who seeth not that god hath trauelled indeede and hath brought foorth a fearefull iudgement on them and hath made them for these thousand yeares and a halfe the gazing stocke the by word and the amazement of all the world thus was it threatned to the iewes and thus it is performed and certainly thus hath it beene threatned amp thus shall it be performed to thee o england except thou preuent the iudgements that are comming o happy england that i may say to thee it is yet but comming for as for the miserable iewes vpon them alas it is come already to those poore soules it can bee said no more repent before the decree come forth for it is now past but thou article happie for thy day is not yet come yet i may say to thee repent before the decree come forth and o happie england that thou mayest heare this worde before sounding in thine eares therefore my beloued brother who are heare assembled out almost of euery corner of this kingdom heare my words and carry them home with you into al country god is the same god still as iust and as iealous as euer hee was our sinnes are as ill nay much viler then the iewes were how can it be then but that must fall to vs that fell to them therefore the zeale of god glorie and my desire of your saluations make mee that i dare not flat but tell you the truth that is that out of all question if we search not our selues amp repent there is a generall iudgement in preparing for vs certainely the decree is out and what can stop the execution of it but repentance god hath long spared and hee hath been long in trauelling therefore though nothing can be said in way of prophesie i am in my conscience perswaded to feare and that out of infallible grounds of the word of god that a plague and a iudgement and that most fearefull hangs ouer england amp that it is alreadie pronounced vpon this nation and shall be as certainely executed without a visible reformation and because i may seeme to speak somewhat at large giue mee leaue to giue you the reasons inducing mee hereunto first the gospel hath beene preached these fiue and thirtie yeares and is daily more and more so that the light thereof neuer shone more gloriously since the primitiue church yet for al this there is a general ignorance generall of all people generall of all points yes as though there were no preaching at all yes when popery was newly banished there was more knowledge in many then is now in the body of our nation and the more it is preached the more ignorant are many the more blinde and the more hardened euen as a stithi the more it is beaten vpon the harder it is so they the more they heare the gospell the lesse esteeme they it and the more they contemne it and the more god calles the deafer they are amp the more they are commanded the more they disobey we preachers may cry till our lunges flie out or bee spent within vs and man are mooued no more then stones o alas what is this or what can this bee but a fearefull signe of distruction will any man endure alwayes to bee mocked then how long hath god beene mocked will any man endure to stand knocking continually if then god hath stood knocking at our hearts fiue amp thirtie yeares is it not now time to bee gone vnlesse we open presently but if we wil know what this argueth to contemne the gospel and not to repent when the word is so abundantly preached read the storie of ely his wicked sonnes hee spake vnto them and gaue them godly counsaile but they hearkened not vnto the voyce of their father but will some say that is no great matter not to heare their father is a common thing but marke what followeth they would not beare their father because the lord would destroy them a fearefull thing euen so it is with a nation or a people are they taught and are they worse and worse take heede if elyes sonnes obey not it is because god will destroy them if therefore ely and many elyes haue spoken to england and england heares not england obeyeth not england repents not take heed the lord in heaue say not england will not heare the voyce of the prophets because i will destroy it let no man say wee take vpon vs to prophesie wee onely giue warning and shewethe daunger by example of the like my second reason is this one iudgement executed and not working repentance is alwayes a fore runner of another that rule is certaine and an euident truth and needs no prouing now we haue beene visited with famines earthquakes pestilences inundations thunder amp lightning in winter and most strange amp vnseasonable weather but alas all these haue taken no effect where is the humiliation repentance and reformation which they haue wrought therefore it must needs bee there remaines behinde a greater iudgement man may be so madde to thinke these to be ordinary things and to come by course of nature and ordinarie causes but certainly they are the shaking of the rod and fore runners of a greater iudgement vnlesse repentance cut of their course for looke as one cloud followeth another till the sun consume them so one iudgement hastens after another and repentance onely is the sun which must dispel them thirdly it stands with the iustice of god according as he hath reuealed it in the scripture especially in deut out of the whole chapter it must needs be gathered as a rule i wil curse that people which breake my lawes now we may not deny but this land of ours is for abundance of sinne a people of sodome all kinde of sinnes in all estates of man rage and raigne euery day more and more therefore i conclude that vnlesse wee repent and so dissolue this cloude of iudgement that hangs ouer our heads it cannot be but a most fearefull tempest is to come at the last and when it is come it will be too late to wish we had done it therefore in the bowels of christ iesus let this be to intreate and exhort you all to search and looke into your selues that so repenting and changing your wayes you may get the sword againe into his sheath which is already drawn out but yet hath not stricken home amp may quench the wrath which is already kindled but yet burns not out as it wil do if by repentance we quench it not amp do this euery one as you tender the saluatio of your owne soules amp the continuance of the gospel to this glorions nation and the peace and prosperous state of this church amp common wealth for let man make what causes they will it is certainely sinfulnesse that ouerturnes kingdomes and changeth states as all these kingdomes and states haue felt who haue continued finally to contemne the gospel it followeth and you be as chaff that passeth on a day the prophet proceedeth amp describeth more plainely the manner and state of that plague which god will send vpon the the meaning was partly opened before to bee in effect thus much search your selues least god take his fanne and try you because you would not try your selues and finding ou vppon the tryall not sound wheat but light chaff blow you to hel with the winde of his wrath the metaphor which the prophet vseth is this he compares the lord to a husband man great and rich the whole world is his corne field seueral nation as this of ours for one are his heapes of corne but these heapes of corne be ful of chaf that is these particular churches are ful of hypocrites now a wise husbandman letteth corne and chaffe lye together no longer then til the winde doth blow and then he appoints his fanning time to seuer his corne from his chaffe and to blow away his chaffe amp lay vp his corne so god the great amp wise husbandman will not let the chaffe lye for euer amongst the wheat hee hath therefore appointed his fanning times when to blow the chaffe into hell and to gather his wheat into heauenly garners now god winnowing times are two the one is at the last day after this life and that is god great winnowing day of all his corne that of al man when the bad shall bee seuered from the good for euer neuer to be mingled againe with the but by the strong and powerfull fanne of his last and finall iudgement to be blowne into hel the winde of whose wrath at that day shall bee stronger to blow them all away then al the winde in the world to blow away one handfull of light chaffe god other fanning time is in this world and that is also double the one is when the word is preached the preaching of the word is one of god fans for when the gospell is preached to a nation or congregation it fannes them and tries them amp purgeth them and so seuers them that a man may see a manifest difference of the chaffe and the wheate that is of the godly man and the wicked man this preaching of the gospell doth john the baptist expresly call a fanne where the holy ghost pursueth this whole metaphor most plainely speaking of christ hee saith whose fanne is in his hand and hee will roughly purge his floore and gather his w eat into his garner but the chaffe he will burne with fire vnquenchable the winde of this fanne of the word preached is so strong as that it seuers the chaffe from the wheate that is good professors from hypocrites in the visible church and blowes so strongly vpon the wicked that it brings them to the beginning of hell euen in this world for it so worketh vpon the conscience as if it cannot conuert them it strikes them with feare terrour amp torment either in life or at death which torment of conscience is the very flashes of hell fire but when this first fanne of the word will not serue to bring man to repentance for the word preached doth not confound a man actually but only pronounce the sentence and thereby strike the conscience then god hath another fanne and that is the fanne of his iudgements and that fanning or winnowing time is when he executes his vengeance and his iudgements on a nation this is his latter fanne the first will not preuaile this his powerfull and strong fanne driuen about with the winde of his wrath this fanne went ouer the olde world and swept them all away and went ouer the nation of the iewes and we see they are no more these three fannes of god make a three fold separation of the chaffe from the wheate that is of the wicked from the elect with the fanne of his word which is powerfull he seuers them in affection and disposition and makes a distinction of them so as generally the wheate is knowne to be wheate and chaffe discerned to be chaffe by the preaching of the word but though the tare be knowne to bee tare yet both grow together so that the word onely seuers them in affection and sets seueral notes of distinction vpon them both but then the second fanne of his iudgements is more violent for thereby he seuereth them a sunder in soule gathering the godly man as his wheat into the heauens amp blowing the soules of the wicked into hell but yet the bodyes of them both lye together as partakers of the same iudgement so subiect to the same corruption and are all lodged in the same graue of the earth and death hath like dominion ouer them all but afterwards at the last day at god great haruest amp great winnowing time he then with the winde of his power seuereth them a sunder in soule and body wheate from the chaffe sheepe from the goates amp separateth them neuer to be mingled againe for euer amp euer and then with the winde of his wrath he blowes the chaffe into fire vnquenchable and with his louing fauour gathereth his wheate into the euerlasting and glorious garners of heauen so then the first seuereth them in affection the second in soule for a time the third actually in soule and body for euer and euer now of these three winnowing times the holy ghost speaketh here properly of the second namely the fan of god iudgements so that the meaning of the metaphor is this search your selues and repent betimes least god come vpon you with some fearefull iudgements because you haue so long contemned the fan of the word and finding you too light to abide the try all doe take you away in the iudgement and cast you into hell for as sure as the fan of the word hath made difference of you which are chaffe and which are wheate so sure shall the fanne of his iudgements blow away the chaffe to hell and damnation thus much for the meaning now for the vse for vs in england the case stands thus our church doubtlesse is god corne field amp we are the corne heape of god and those brownisles and sectaries are blinde and besotted who cannot see that the church of england is a godly heape of god corne but withall we must cofesse we are ful of chaffe that is of prophane amp wicked hypocrits whose hearts and mindes abound in sinnes and rebellions and many of our best professors are also too full of chaffe that is of corruptions and doe giue themselues too much libertie in many sinnes but alas the pure wheate how thinne is it scattered howe hard to finde a man at least a family which dedicate themselues to the lord in holy and sincere obedience and labour to make conscience of all sinnes now therefore seeing wee are god corne field and we haue some pure wheat amongst much chaffe therefore god will winnow vs to find out the corne if hee haue but one corne of wheat in a handfull of chaffe but one good man of many he will stirre all the heape for those fewe cornes hee will not care to blow all the chaffe to hell to finde out those fewe cornes of wheat to lay them vp in heauen so that out of all question england being so ful of chaffe must look to be winnowed nowe for the first fanne of his word it hath beene vsed in this land these fiue and thirtie yeares and that as powerfully and as plentifully as any where in the worlde and yet alas many are more godlesse more ignorant more prophane then euer they were yes wickednesse groweth and the chaffe increaseth aboue the wheate bee sure therefore that god will bring his second fanne vpon vs because wee will not suffer the first and the milde and gentle fanne of his word to try and search vs therefore hee will bring the fearefull fanne of his iudgements and with it hee will blowe soule amp body into hell with those our sinnes amp corruptions which we would not suffer the fanne of god worde to blowe from vs the first hath so long blowen in vaine that the second must needs come vpon vs amp it hath already begun to blow three or four blasts haue blown ouer vs famin pestilence earthquakes fire water winde these haue so blowne some of vs that they haue taken away a great number of vs for vs that remaine this onely remaines that wee strengthen our selues by grace to be able to stand against the next blast for come it wil amp when it comes no wealth nor worldly thing can inable vs to endure it onely faith amp repentance amp the grace of god will stand at that day now therefore in that so feareful a fanning abideth vs seeing it is so neer as appeareth by the blasts already past ouer vs which are nothing but the forerunners of a greater tepest what shuld be our care except wee care not to be blown body amp soule into hel but to labour to efchew this feareful fan of god wrath or at least if it come vpo vs that it may not blow vs to hell but hasten vs to heauen it thy heart be touched to aske how this may be i answere thee onely to follow the prophets aduice in this place by searching and trying our selues the way to escape god triall is to try thy selfe and to escape god iudgement to be a iudge to thine owne soule and so the way to escape the fearfull fanne of god is to fanne thine own heart by the law of god for whomsoeuer the first fanne that is the word of god doth worke vpon these man are neuer blowen away with the fanne of god iudgements o then entertaine the word of god into thy heart submit thy soule vnto it let it pearce amp try and ransacke thy heart and lay before thee thy wretched estate by thy sinnes and when thou seest thynakednesse and misery confesse it bewayle it be humbled for it cry amp call for mercy and forgiuenesse pray against thy speciall sinnes striue to purge them out as the poyson of thy soule craue grace from god against al thy sinnes and if thou seest any sins more welcome to thy nature more deere vnto thee and which more prevaile against thee then others doe pray against these sinnes and striue against them aboue all and endeuour that by the fanne of god word they may bee blowen away from thee when thou hast done this then marke what will come of it when thou hast fanned thy selfe god will not fanne thee but when the fanne of his iudgemet comes and bloweth so strongly vpon the wicked then the lord finding thee already fanned and clensed by his word will spare thee and his iudgement shall either blow ouer thee and passe by thee vntouched as ouer lot in the destruction of sodom or else shall fanne out all thy corruptions and blow thee vp to heauen to be laid vp as pure wheat in the heauenly garners and mansions of glory which christ ascended to prepare for thee now then amongst those many businesses with which this world doth comber euery one of vs all which shall perish with the worlde it selfe let vs good brother spare some time for this great businesse martha may be combred about many things but this is that one thing which is necessarie therefore whatsoeuer is done let not this bee vndone once a day put thy selfe and thy life vnder the fanne of god lawe try thy selfe what thou article and thy life how thou liuest once a day keepe a court in thy conscience call thy thoughts thy wordes and thy deedes to their tryall let the ten commaundements passe vpon them and thy sins and corruptios which thou findest to be chaffe blow them away by repetance so shalt thou remaine pure and cleane wheate fit for the house and church of god in this world amp for his kingdome in heauen but if we will not doe this then alas what wil follow my heart grieueth to vtter it but i must vnlesse i should be a false prophet and therefore i wil our long peace plentie and ease haue bred great sinnes so great that they reach to heauen and prouoke god maiestie to his face and so strong that they will violently drawe downe iudgments from god vpon vs which when they come they will bee so powerfull and so violent that they will blow vs away like chaffe and bring this kingdome to some miserable ruine o therefore how happy are wee if we can entertaine this doctrine and practise it for in so doing we shall preuent god iudgements wee shall continue the gospell to this land and preserue this glorious nation from being destroyed or dispeopled by some fearefull iudgement beloued you come hither to this place purposely to buy and sell and thereby to better your estates in this world how happy then are you if besides the good markets you make for your body and estates you learne also how to make your selues abide the triall of god iudgements and how to be made pure corne fit to replenish the garners of heauen amp how to continue god fauour and the gospell to this nation if thou goe away with this lesson thou hast a iewel more worth then if thou shouldest goe home possessed or all the huge riches of this faire you call this and such like times faire times but if thou learne this lesson right then thou maist say that this was the fairest day in deede that euer shon vpon thee since thou wast borne this pretious iewell which i haue spoken of all this while i heare offer vnto thee euery one brings hither some thing to bee solde this is the merchandize that i bring and set to sale vnto you what euer commoditie any of you bring it is from some quarter of this land but all is from the earth but this that i bring it is from heauen and all the earth cannot yeelde it and as it is from heauen so it is of a heauenly vertue and will worke that which all the wealth in this faire is not able to doe therefore cast not to buy the basest and let passe the best of all and neuer alledge that it is aboue thy compasse and being a iewell it is too deare and costly for thee for i offer it freely vnto you and to euery one of you i pronounce vnto you from the lord that here this blessed doctrine is offered vnto you all in his name freely and that you may buy it without money happie is that day when thou comming so farre to buy things for thy bodie and paies so deare for them doest meete with so pretious a iewell the vertue whereof is to saue thy soule and payest nothing for it thou maiest hereafter reioyce and say i went to buy and sell and to helpe my body but i haue also learned to saue my soule i went thither to helpe to maintaine my owne estate but i haue learned to helpe to maintaine england in prosperitie for assuredly if wee would all of vs learne this lesson and practise it we might assure our selues of the glorious prosperity of england to cotinue from generatio to generation whereas alas if we continue amp go forward in our sins amp impenitency it is greatly to bee feared that neither the gospell nor this peace will reach to our posterities therefore now to make an end i once againe amp lastly comend this doctrine to you al amp euery one of you for this marchandise that i bring is of that nature that though some take it yet there is also enough for euery one and i commend it vnto you euen from the very mouth of god himselfe thinke of it i charge thee as euer thou lookest to appeare before the face of christ iesus the great iudge at the last day and if thou wouldest escape the rigour of that iudgement enter now into iudgement with thy selfe and search thy selfe if thou now wilt not receiue this doctrine then shal it at the last day be a bill of enditement against thee for if it saue thee not it shal condemne thee thinke of it therefore seriously as a matter that concernes thy soule and bodie yes and thy posteritie and this whole realme all which shall smart for it if we repent not and if the body of our people and those whose harts are wedded to this world wil not enterteine this doctrine then i turne vnto you that feare the lord and to you i direct my last warning search o search and try your hearts and liues renewe and reuiue your faith and repentance that if iudgements doe come and blowe vpon this nation and driue the gospell from it and it to hell that yet you may haue a testimony to your consciences that you did not pull down this generall calamitie but for your parts laboured to haue preuented it by your earnest prayers and heartie repentance that so the posteritie ensuing may not curse you but speake reuerently of you and praise god for you and wish that al had done as you did for then had they enioyed this goodly land and al god blessings with it as wee their forefathers did before them amp so shall our names not rot but flourish amongst the posterities to come which shall bee partakers of the desolation and when we haue renewed our repentance let vs then euery one of vs deale with the lord by earnest prayer for this church and nation that the lord would shew his mercy vppon it and continue vnto it this place amp the gospell it is nothing with the lord to doe it his powerfull hand is not shortened he can continue our peace when the papists look for hurli burlies he can continue the gospell when they hope to set vp their idolatry againe let vs therefore apply the lord with our praiers and with moses set our selues in the breach and pray for the ignorances of the multitude and bewaile their sinnes who bewaile not their owne so did noah daniel and iob in their ages and prayed for the people in generall calamities let vs all be noahs daniels and iobs in our generations if we doe thus then when iudgements come we shall either turne them away from our nation or at the least wee shall deliuer our owne soules let vs nowe turne to the lorde in prayer and because it cannot be hoped but that this our generall sinfulnesse must needs end with some heauy iudgment let vs desire the lord still to defer our deserued punishments and still to spare vs and to giue vs time and leasure to repent that so we entering into our selues and searching our hearts and turning to the lord wee may turne away his imminent iudgemets and that when his wrath doth burne out indeed we may then bee counted worthie in christ to escape those things which must needes come vpon the worlde amen william perkins lament let vs search and try our waies and turne againe to the lord trin vni deo gloria if there bee with him a messenger an interpreter one of a thousand to declare vnto man his righteousnesse then will be haue mercie on him and will say deliuer him that he goe not downe into the pit for i haue receiued a reconciliation in this chapter and the former elihu a holy learned noble amp wise young man had conference with iob in matters of high and excellent diuinitie the points of his conference are these from the first verse of this chap to the verse is a praeface to his speach from thence to the he repeateth certaine propositions of iob and reproueth them fro thence to these wordes hee instructeth iob in certaine points touching god dealing with sinners and those are two how god preserueth a sinner from falling how god restoreth a sinner being falne the meanes whereby god preserueth a sinner are set downe to bee two principall by admonitions in dreames and visions by scourges and chastisments when the first will not preuaile and these are layde downe from the thirteene verse vnto these words then followeth the point namely the restoring of a sinner when both the meanes formerly spoken of haue not preuailed with him but that through his corruption he is fallen and concerning this point he handleth these particulers the remedie and meanes of his restoring the effect that followeth thereupon the remedie is layde downe in these wordes now red vnto vs then followeth the effect which is that when a sinner is restored by repentance then the graces of god are plentifully powred vpon him both for soule amp body from these words to the end of the chapter the intent then of this scripture is that god vseth meanes in his mercie to preserue sinners from falling into sinne but if they doe then hee in much greater mercie afordeth them meanes and helpes to rise againe and this is the summe and substance of the words now that means and remedie is the matter i purpose to speake of out of these wordes the meanes then to restore a sinner after a fall is to raise him by repentance to a better estate then hee was in before and that is inclusiuely and by implication taught in this text but the instrument by whom that great worke is to be wrought is here in plaine termes layd downe to bee a minister of god lawfully called and sent by god amp appointed by his church to that great dutie so that these wordes containe a worthy description of a true minister and he is here described by his titles which are two an angell an interpreter by his rarnesse one of a thousand by his office which is to declare vnto man his righteousnes by the blessing that god giueth vpon the labours of this true minister which is then god will haue mercie vpon the sinner by his commission and authoritie in the last wordes god will say deliuer him that he goe not downe into the pit for i haue receiued a reconciliation let vs speake of them in order as they lie in the text and first of his titles the first title of a minister of god is he is called a messenger or an angel and not here alone but elswhere in the scripture malachy he is the messenger of the lord of hostes and in the reuelation the ministers of the churches are called the angels of those churches so that it is apparant a true minister is an angel of god in one place and in the other place the angel of the church hee is an angell or messenger sent from god to his church this consideration affords matter of much vse and first for ministers themselues the most of vs in this place this sermon was in the vniversitie church to the body of the vniuersitie are eyther prophets or sonnes of the prophets if thou be a prophet thou article god angel if a son of the prophets thou intendest to bee then marke thy dutie prophets and ministers are angels in the very institution of their calling therefore thou must preach god word as god word and deliuer it as thou receiuest it for angels embassadors and messengers carry not their owne message but the message of their lord and maisters who sent them and ministers carry the message of the lord of hostes therefore they are bound to deliuer it as the lord and not their owne in the first epistle of peter wee are bid if any man speake let him speake not onely the word of god but as the word of god god word must bee spoken and as god word then shew thy faithfulnesse to the lord in discharging thy hands sincerely of that message which he hath honoured thee to carry god word is pure thercfore purely to be thought vpon and to be deliuered then let all that are god angels and would be honoured as his angels and embassadors thinke it no lesse reason to doe the dutie of god angels least as many man mark a good tale in the telling so they take away the power and maiestie of god word in the manner of deliuering it the second vse concernes the ministers also are they god angels therefore they must preach god word in the euidence amp demonstration of the spirit of god for he that is god angell the spirit of that god must speake in him now to speake in the demonstration of god spirit is to speake in such a plaines and yet such a powerfulnes as that the capacities of the simplest may perceiue not man but god teaching them in that plainesse and the conscience of the mightiest may feele not man but god reproue them in that powerfulnesse that this is so appeares by saint paul if a man prophecie aright saith the holy ghost the vnlearned or vnbeleeuing man comes in hee thinkes his secret faults are disclosed and laid open he thinkes all man see his nakednesse and doe reproue him for it he therefore falls down and saith surely god speakes in this man in which words obserue an admirable plainesse and an admirable powerfulnesse which a man would thinke coulde not so well stand together first plainnesse for whereas the vnlearned man perceiueth his faults discouerrd it followeth necessarily he must needes vnderstand and if an vnlearned man vnderstand it then consequently it must needes be plaine secondly powerfulnesse in that his conscience is so conuinced his secret faults so disclosed and his very heart so ript vp that he saith certainly god speakes in this man this is the euidence and demonstration of god spirit it is thought good commendation before the world when man say of a preacher surely this man hath showne himselfe a proper scholler of good learning great reading strong memory and good deliuery and so it is and such commendation if iust is not to be contemned but that that commends a man to the lord his god and to his owne conscience is when he preacheth so plainely to the capacitie and so powerfully to the conscience of a wicked man as that he thinkes doubtlesse god is within him article thou therefore an angell of god then magnifie the spirite of god and not thy selfe in thy preaching of his word the next vse is for the hearers and they are here taught that if their ministers bee angels sent them from god then are they to heare them gladly willingly reuerently and obediently gladly and willingly because they are ambassadors reuerently and obediently because they are sent from the high god the king of kings and doe deliuer his embaslage god saith the people must seeke the lawe at his mouth and good reason for if the lawe be the reuealed will of god and the minister the angell of god then where should they seeke the will of god but at the mouth of his angell the reason therefore followeth well in that place they should seeke the lawe at his mouth for hee is the messenger of the lord of hosts and this must all christians doe not onely if their doctrine be pleasing vnto them but though it crosse their corruptions and bee quite contrary to their dispositions yes though it bee neuer so vnsauory and harde vnto nature yet in as much as it is a message from thy god and king and the teacher the angellor messenger of that god therefore both hee and it must be receiued with all reuerence and with the very obedience of the heart and soule and this is the cause why a conuenient reuerence and honour is to be giuen of all good christians euen to the persons of god ministers especially when they adorne their high calling with a holy life euen because they are angels of god saint paule teacheth that woman ought to be modestly altired in the congregation because of the angels it is not onely because the holy angels are present and alwaies beholders of our seruice of god but euen because the ministers which are angels and messengers sent from god are there delinering their message and embassy receiued from god and thus we haue the first title giuen to the minister he is an angell an interpreter secondly hee is an interpreter that is one that is able to deliuer aright the reconciliation made between god and man i say not the author of that reconciliation for that is the godhead it selfe nor the worker of this reconciliation for that is the second person christ iesus nor the assurer or ratifier of it for that is the holy ghost nor the instrument of it for that is the glad tidings of the gospell but i say he is the interpreter of it that is first one that can open and explane the couenant of grace and rightly lay downe the meanes how this reconciliation is wrought secondly one that can rightly and iustly apply those meanes for the working of it out thirdly one that hath authoritie to publish and declare it when it is wrought and by these three actions hee is god interpreter to the people then hee is also the peoples interpreter to god by being able to speake to god for them to lay open their wants and nakednesses to confesse their sinnes to craue pardon and forgiuenesse to giue thankes in their names for mercies receiued and in a word to offer vp all their spirituall sacrifices vnto god for them and so euery true minister is a double interpreter god to the people and the peoples to god in which respects hee is properly called god mouth to the people by preaching to them from god and the peoples mouth to god by praying for them to god and this title sheweth how great amp glorious a calling this ministery is if it be rightly conceiued now then for the vse of it first if euery true minister must bee god interpreter to the people and the peoples to god then hence wee learne that euery one who either is or intends to be a minister must haue that tongue of the learned whereof is spoken in esay wher the prophet saith first in the name of christ as he that is the great prophet and teacher of his church and secondarily in the name of himselfe and all true prophets while the worlde endureth the lorde god hath giuen me a tongue of the learned that i should knowe to speake a word in season to him that is wearie where note the wearie soules or troubled conscience must haue a word in season spoken to him for his comfort and that cannot bee spoken without the tongue of the learned and lastly that tongue of the learned must bee giuen of god now to haue this tongue of the learned which esay speakes of what is it but to be this interpreter which the holy ghost heere saith a minister must bee but to bee able to speake with this tongue is first to bee furnished with humane learning secondly with diuine knowledge as farre as it may by outward meanes bee taught from man to man but besides these hee that will speake this tongue aright must be inwardly learned and taught by the spirit of god the two first he must learne from man but the third from god a true minister must be inwardly taught by the spiritual school maister the holy ghost saint john in the reuelatio must take the book that is the scripture and eate it and when hee hath eaten it then saith the angell he must goe preach to nation tongues people and to kings which was done not that saint john had not eaten that booke in the comming downe of the holy ghost the very ende of whose comming was to teach them spiritually but that in him christ might teach his church for euer that no minister is fit to preach to nation and to kings vntill they haue eaten the booke of god that is till after and besides all the learning that man can teach them they be also taught by the spirit of god himselfe and this teaching is it that makes a man a true interpreter and without this he cannot be for how can a man bee god interpreter to his people vnlesse he knowe the mind of god himselfe and how can he knowe the minde of god but by the teaching of the spirit of god for as no man knoweth the thought of a man but the spirit of man that is in him so the things of god knoweth no ma but the spirit of god indeed we may be mans interpreter by humane teaching and may interpret the scriptures truly and soundly as a humane booke or storie for the increase of knowledge but the diuine amp spiritual interpreter which shal pearce the hart and astonish the soule of man must bee taught by the inward teaching of the holy ghost let no man thinke i heere giue the least allowance to anabaptisticall fancies and reuelations which are nothing but eyther dreames of their owne or illusions of the diuell for they contemne both humane learning and the study of the scripture and trust wholy to reuelations of the spirit but god spirit worketh not but vpon the foundation of the worde onely i teach this that a minister must bee a diuine interpreter an interpreter of god meaning and therfore he must not onely reade the books but eate it that is not onely haue the knowledge of diuine things flowing in his braine but ingrauen in his heart and printed in his soule by the spirituall finger of god and therefore for this end after all his owne study meditation conference commentaries and after all humane helps hee must pray with dauid open thou mine eyes that i may see the wonders of thy lawe the discerning of those wonders requires a spirituall illumination and the opening of them requires the tongue of the learned therefore after all the studie which flesh and blood and humane reason can yeelde pray with the prophet lord giue me the tongue of the learned that i may be a right interpreter of thy holy will furthermore inasmuch as ministers are interpreters they must labour for sanctitie and holinesse of life in esay the king of assiria is saide to bee sanctified or set a part to destroy god enemy if there be a certaine kind of sanctification necessary for the worke of destruction then how much more is true sanctification necessarie for this great and glorious worke of the edification of god church a minister is to declare the reconciliation between god and man and is hee himselfe not reconciled dare he present another man to god mercy for pardon and neuer yet presented himselfe can hee commend the state of grace to another and neuer felt the sweetenesse thereof in his owne soule dare hee come to preach sanctification with polluted lips and out of an vnsanctified heart moses might not stand vpon the mount in god presence till hee had put off his shooes from off his feet exod and dare any man presume to come into this most high and holy presence of the lord vntill he haue mortified his corruptions and cast off the vnrulines of his affections in exodus the priests are bid to sanctifie the people and in leuiticus it is saide that god will be sanctified in all that come neere him but who come so neere vnto god as the ministers do so that it is apparant ministers doe sanctifie the people and in some construction god himselfe nowe shall they one way bee sanctifiers of the people another way of god himselfe and no way of themselues surely if it bee so they are but lame interpreters and this is the reason doubtlesse why vnsanctified ministers and such as are of a loose conuersation bestow such fruitlesse labours in the church many want no learning no ability to interpret amp yet how fewe soules doe they bring to god some it may bee are conuerted by their ministerie that god may shewe the efficacie is not in the person of man but in the ordinance of god but fewe doubtlesse for ought that we can see to teach vs how god hateth him which will take in hand to reconcile others to god himselfe being vnreconciled seing then ministers are god interpreters to the people to declare amp publish their reconciliation with god and that they cannot be reconciled vnlesse they be sanctified and can so hardly bee sanctified by the ministerie of an vnsanctified man let therefore all true ministers of god first be god interpreters to their owne consciences and their owne soules interpreters to god then shall they know more perfectly how to discharge the office of true interpreters between god and his people and thus we haue the true titles of a true minister now it followeth in the text one of a thousand here is the second part of this description which is by the rarenesse or scarcenesse of good ministers which is layd downe in a very strange phrase namely that a true minister one that is a right angel and a true interpreter is no common or ordinarie man but thin sowne one of many nay one of a thousand the meaning hereof is to be conceiued either properly or figuratiuely in the figuratiue sence it is spoken in relation to ministers themselues in the proper sense it hath a comparison with all man the figuratiue and hyperbolicall sense is that of all the ministers in the worlde not one of many is a right angel and a true interpreter the plaine amp proper sense is that amongst the man of this worlde there is not one of a thousand which proues a true minister for this point let vs examine three points the truth of it the reasons of it and the vse of it the truth hereof is manifest by the experience of all ages wherein it is strange to obserue how fewe man of any sort especially of the better sort affect the calling of a minister and which is more strange howe fewe of those that are ministers in name and title doe deserue these honourable names of an angel and an interpreter and the truth is too manifest in common practise to insist much vpon it rather therefore let vs see the reasons of it and they be these principally first the contempt that lyeth on that calling it being alwayes hated by wicked and prophane man because it discouers their filthines and vnmaskes their hypocrisie and their doctrine oftimes is a fretting corrasiue to their conscience that they cannot welter and wallowe so quietly and secretly in their sinnes as otherwise they would therefore is it that they spurne both against the calling and the man and watch them narrowly and take holde of their least infirmities thereby to disgrace them iudging that to cast contempt on that calling is to remoue shame from their owne shamefull courses nor is it possible but that they should thus hate this calling inasmuch as they hate so deadly both that lawe and embassy which they bring and that god whose embassadors they are this hatred and disgrace in the wicked world was that that caused ieremie to cry woe is me amp made him in the seeming of his natural reason curse y e time y t euer he was a prophet for saith he i am a man of cotention euery man is at strife and at enmitie with me the next reason is the difficultie of discharging the duties of his calling to stand in god presence to enter into the holy of holiest to goe between god amp his people to be god mouth to the people and the peoples to god to be the interpreter of the eternall lawe of the olde testament and the euerlasting gospell of the new to stand in the roume and to beare the office of christ himselfe to take the care and charge of soules these considerations are so many amazements to the consciences of such man who doe with reuerence approch amp not with rashnes rush vnto this sacred seate this made saint paul cry out who is sufficient for these things and if paul said who is no marnell though many a man say i am not sufficient and doe therefore draw their neckes from this yoke and their hands from this plough vntill god himselfe or his church doe presse them to it the last reason is more peculiar to this age of the newe testament namely want of maintenance and preferment for them that labour in this calling man are flesh and blood and in that respect must be allured and wonne to embrace this vocation by some arguments which may perswade flesh and blood the world hath in all ages beene negligent herein and therefore god in his law tooke such strict orders for the maintenance of the leuites but especially now vnder the gospel this calling is vnprouided for when it deserues best of all to be rewarded certainly it were a worthy christian pollicie to propound good preferments to this calling that thereby man of the worthiest giftes might be won vnto it and the want thereof is cause why so many young man of speciall partes and greatest hope turne to other vocations and especially to the lawe wherein at this day the greatest partes of the finest wits of our kingdome are imployed amp why but because they haue al the meanes to rise wheras the ministerie for the most part yeeldeth nothing but a plaine way to beggery this is a great blemish in our church and surely i wish the papists those children of this world were not wiser in their kinde in this point then the church of god the reformation hereof is a worke worth the labour of prince and people amp speciall care is to bee had in it else it will not be reformed for doubtlesse had not god himselfe in the olde testament taken such straight orders for the liuings of the leuites they had beene put to no lesse extremities then is the ministrie of this age and this reason added to the other makes them perfect and all put together make a reason infallible for who will vndergo so vile contempt and vndertake so great a charge for no reward and where there is so great contempt so heauie a burthen and so meane a reward what maruell if a good minister be one of a thousand now let vs make vse of this doctrine the vse is manifold and yeelds instructions to many sorts of people first rulers and magistrates are heere taught if good ministers be so scarce therefore to mainetaine and increase and doe all good they can to the schooles of the prophets to vniuersities colledges amp schooles of good learning which are the seminaries of the ministerie herein the example of samuel is very worthy to bee followed in whose dayes the schooles of the prophets florished and euen saul himselfe though hee did much hurt in israel yet when he came to the schooles of the prophets his hard heart relented he could doe them no hurt nay he put off his robes amp prophecied amongst them so should all christian princes and magistrates aduaunce their schooles and see them both well maintained and well stored the reason is euident amp forcible a good minister is one of if therfore they would haue the number increased let them maintaine the seminaries and againe if antichrist to vphold his kingdome the kingdome of sathan bee so carefull herein to erect colledges and indowe them with liuing to bee seminaries for his synagogue and vse so great meanes to sowe his tares in the hearts of young man that so they may sowe them in the hearts of the people abroad shall not christian princes bee as carefull or rather much more zealous for the increasing of the number of godly ministers shall baal haue his hundred prophets and god haue his elijah alone great shame must it bee to ahab or to any king whose kingdome is in that estate the jesuit diligence is such in teaching and the readinesse of some of their nouices such in learning the diuell himselfe doubtlesse putting to his helpe withall that in three yeares as some of them say of themselues they proceede in humane learning and in the fourth in diuinitie which if it be so then it may bee a good lesson for these our schooles of learning and an inducement to moue all that haue the gouernment thereof to labour to aduance learning by all good meanes and to giue it more speedie passage and it may shame some that spend so many yeares in the vniuersitie and yet alas for all that proue not one of a in these our schooles are by god mercy many young trees planted by the river side of this goodly orchard which by good ordring and dressing may prooue goodly trees in the temple of god and strong pilstrong pillers in the church but they are like tender plants and must be cherished princes and great man by allowing maintenance and the gouernours by establishing good orders and looking carefully to their execution must see that these plants haue sufficient moisture to grow speedily to perfect ripenesse and that then they be transplanted in due time into the church and common wealth these be the trees spoke of in ezechiel which growe by the sides of the river which floweth out of the sanctuarie water out of the sanctuary must norish them and so they growe vnto their perfection but take away these water take away the liberalitie of princes and good discipline from the vniuersities and these trees must needes decay and wither which if they do then the smal number of good ministers will be fewer amp fewer amp of one of a ther wil not be one of in the next place ministers themselues are here taught first if good ministers bee so scarce then let euery man feare to make them fewer then they bee euery man therefore for himselfe labour first for abilitie then for conscience to discharge his dutie namely to bee an angel to deliuer faithfully god embassy and a true interpreter between god and his people thus if thou doest then howsoeuer the number of good ministers is small yet it shall bee nothing smaller for thee if they bee so fewe labour to increase them for the more they are the lesse burden lyeth vpon each particular man therefore let euery minister by his teaching and by his conuersation labour so to honour his calling that hee may thereby allure and drawe others to a loue and liking thereof are good ministers so thinne sowne are there so few of them then let all good and godly ministers giue the right hand of fellowship one to another and ioyne together in loue amp by that meanes arme theselues against the scorne and contempt of the world we see they that are of a kinred or a brotherhood or any kind of societie the fewer they are the more closelie doe they combine the more firmely doe they holde together against all foreign force so ought god ministers to doe because their number is so small if they were many lesse danger in their disvnion but seeing they are so fewe the more it concerneth them to cut off contentions and all occasions of debate and to ioyne hand in hand against these common aduersaries in the third place young students are heere taught seeing a true minister is but one of a thousand that therfore they bend their studies and their thoughts to the ministerie for they well know it is an old prouerbe the best things are hard to come by amp certainly there are so few good ministers because the holy ministerie in it selfe is so high amp excellent a calling amp as it is a shame to the man that there are so few good ministers so it is a commendation to the calling whose honour amp excellency is such that as wee see heere scarce one of a thousand attaines vnto it therefore man of the most excellent giftes are here inuited to dedicate themselues vnto the most excellent vocation yes very reason it selfe would vrge a man to be one of a thousand and further as they are to intend this calling as the most rare and excellent so this must teach them like wise to hasten to furnish themselues with all good helpes and meanes that they may become true ministers and able interpreters and not too long to sticke in those studies which keep a man from the practise of this high function for it is not to liue in the niuersitie or in the colledge and to studie though a man neuer so fast deuoure vp learning but to be a good minister is that that makes a man one of a thousand in the last place hearers are heere taught their dutie first to respect with reuerence the person and to receiue with reuerence the message of euery true messenger seeing it is so rare a thing to finde a true minister for as nothing is more vile or base then an evil amp lewd minister whom christ compares to salt which hath lost his sauour which is good for nothing but to bee cast out amp troden downe of man so is there none worthy of more loue and reuerence then a holy minister for as esay saith their very feete are beautifull which bring glad tydings and we should kisse their feete which bring newes of peace therefore all good christians are to receiue and vse a good minister as s paul saith the galathians did him euen as an angel of god hast thou then a godly pastor run to him for conference for comfort for counsell vse his company frequent his fermons account him worthy of double honour thinke it no small or ordinary blessing for thou hast one of a thousand and blesse god for bestowing his mercy on thee which hee had denyed to so many others for some haue no minister some haue a minister but yet he is not one of a thousand and further all man that are fathers may heere learne to consecrate their children to god in the seruice of the ministerie considering that it is so rare and excellent a thing to be a good minister nay that man should thinke himselfe happie and honoured of god who may be father to such a son as shal proue one of a thousand in a word to conclude this point all man must heere learne seeing good ministers are so scarce to pray the lorde of the haruest to thrust out more labourers into his haruest and for those that are called already that god would make them faithfull in that high function and as elisha craueth of elijah that the good spirit may be doubled and trebled vpon them so that the number may be encreased and thus wee haue the truth the reason and the vse of this that a good minister is one of a thousand it followeth to declare vnto man his righteousnesse heere is the third part of the description of a minister that is by his office to declare vnto man his righteousnesse that is when a poore sinner by his sinnes the foulnes whereof he seeth and the burden whereof he feeleth is brought downe as it were to the very gates of hell when this sinner by the preaching of the lawe is brought to a true sight of this miserie and again by preaching the gospel is brought to lay hold on iesus christ then it is the proper office of a minister to declare vnto that man his righteousnes namely that though in himselfe he be as ill and as foule as sinne can make him amp as the law can discouer him to be yet in christ he is righteous amp iust and by christ so iustified as he is no more a sinner in the presence and account of god this is the righteousnes of a christian man this is the iustification of a sinner and to declare this righteousnes to him that repents and belieues is the proper dutie of a true minister in the actes paule saith of himselfe that he witnessed to the iewes amp to the gentiles the repentance towards god and faith towards our lord iesus christ in which words is layde downe the complete dutie of a minister as he is a publique angell or interpreter first to preach repentance which a man must performe to god whom by his sins hee hath grieuously offended secondly to preach faith in christ and free forgiuenes and perfect saluation through that faith in christ to all that shal truly belieue in him and after both these followeth that which is heere spoken of which comprehendeth both the former namely to declare vnto man his righteeusnesse so that in these words are inclusi ely layd downe these points of a ministers calling first a true minister may amp must declare vnto a sinfull man where righteousnesse is to be found namely in iesus christ the righteous secondly how that righteousnes may bee obtained namely by d ing two duties first by denying amp disclaiming his owne righteousnesse and that is done by repentance secondry by clayming amp cleaning to christe righteousnes and that is done by faith thirdly a true minister may and must declare this righteousnes to him that is first publish and proclaime that it is ready to his bestowed on euery sinner which will thus apprehend it and that it is able to iustifie and saue him secondly beside a bare publication of this instification he must as paul did witnes and testifie it to the conscience of the sinner that it is as certainely true god is true for as a witnesse in doubtfull cases is called that by his testimone may cleere the truth so when the consciences of poore sinners are and doubtfull what to belieue when they doubt of this righteousnesse then is a true minister as a faithfull witnesse of god to auerre and testifie this truth from his owne conscience knowledge and feeling of the infallible certaintie of god promises vnto the doubtfull and distres ed conscience of the sinner thirdly besides declaration and testificati n been to maintaine this truth and this righteousnesse if the sinners conscience be yet not quiet against all gain sayers against the power of darknesse and all the gates of helld that this is true and perfect righteousness to him that apprehends it as afore is downe this is so infallible to euery soule that repents and beleeueth that the minister may assure it to the conscience of the sinner in the worde of truth and in the name of god and may call to all god saints and all his holy angels and may vnto him his owne vpon it that it is most true that this is perfect and sufficient righteousnesse that we see in some measure what it is to declare vnto a man his righteousnes and this is the peculiar office of a minister of god and this is the height and excellencie of his office in the want of godly ministers i confesse that godly christian man may one helpe another in the performance of these duties and that with profit but it is the proper function of a godly minister to doe it and the promise and blessing belong properly to him as the consciences of all penitent sinners will testifie in this case let dauids serue for many who when hee was cast downe euen to the mouth of hell by that fearefull discovery of his two hideous sinnes by nathans preaching amp when the faith of his soule beganne to wrestle against hell and striue against despaire and to apprehend the mercy of god in christ then i say could not the testimonie of all the man in the worlde haue giuen him that ioy comfort and assurance that nathan did when hee saide in the word of a prophet and of a true minister god hath taken away thy sinne thou shalt not dye what did nathan here but declare vnto man his righteousnesse what did nathan heere but the duty of euery true minister if this be the office and duty of a minister and if such bee the height and excellency of his office let vs see then what vse we may make of it first concerning the ministerie it first discouereth how nakedly weakely and insufficiently the popish church doth declare vnto man his righteousnesse who wil let a man seeke it in himselfe where alas it is not for paule himselfe testifieth that his desire is that hee may bee found out of himselfe and in christ and yet certainly if euer man had righteousnesse of his owne worth trusting to paule had this is the cause why so many of that religion finde not that righteousnesse which will pacific and satisfie their consciences when they come to dye and why so many of them whe it comes to the pinch do then go out of themselues and with vs doe seek for this righteousnesse in christ where both assuredly and sufficiently it is to be found then for our owne ministerie heere they are taught first the true manner of teaching and declaring righteousnesse namely this not to preach the lawe alone or the gospell alone as some vnaduisedly doe but both without profite but both the lawe and the gospell the lawe to breed repentance the gospell to worke f th but in order first the lawe to breede repentance and then the gospell to worke faith and forgiuenesse but neuer before secondly they are taught to bee holy to bee sanctified and reconciled themselues for is it thy office to declare vnto man his righteousnesse and not thy own to thy selfe and how canst thou bee a true witnesse to testifie between god and the soule of a sinner when thy owne soule knoweth not nor feeleth the truth of it certainly such man are but lame witnesses between god and the sinners soule dauid saith to the sinner i will instruct thre in the way wherein thou shalt goe but hee first of all in the same sets downe his owne experience in a large story of his owne repentance and of god mercy on himselfe and though god some time doe satisfie and saue the poore distressed soule of a sinner by the testimonie of such man to teach vs that the vertue is not in the man but in the truth of god couenant yet alas how fewe are they to teach vs how pleasing it is vnto him when a minister is a declarer of that righteousnesse to others which hee first hath himselfe and is a witnesse of that truth to others which he first knoweth in his owne experience thirdly the consideration of this high excellencie of their calling must arme all true ministers against the scorne and contempt of the world which by wicked man is cast like dust and mire into the face of ministers let this suffice them they are the man that must declare vnto man his righteousnesse euen he that scornes and contemnes the ministerie hee hath no righteousnesse in him vnlesse it bee by the meanes of a poore minister then doe thou thy duty and bee that mockes thee hath cause to honour thee and let this encourage students to consecrate themselues to the ministery for what calling hath so high an office as this to declare vnto man his righteousnesse and assuredly how euer in this wicked world thou article little accounted of for if it did not so it were not wicked yet thou article honoured in the harts of all god children and euen in the conscience of some whose tongues doe smite thee and the soules of thousands when they dye shal blesse thee who in their liues cared not for thee and the diuell himselfe doth enuy amp the holy angels themselues doe wonder at the excellency of thy calling in that thou hast power to declare vnto man his righteousnesse in the next place hearers may heere learne first if their righteousnesse bee thus to bee declared as afore then if they will haue it they must seeke it as it may bee found namely both in the lawe and in the gospell and not in the gospell alone and first in the lawe then in the gospell for he must neuer looke to taste the sweetnes of the gospell which hath not first swallowed the bitter pilles of the law if therefore thou wouldest be declared righteous by the gospell bee content first to bee pronounced miserable by the lawe if thou wouldst be declared righteous in christ then bee content first to bee pronounced sinfull and vnrighteous in thy selfe secondly all man may heere learne how they are to esteeme of god ministers and what reuerence and obedience is due to their persons and their doctrine these are they which must declare vnto thee thy righteousnesse if thou hast any article thou beholden to him who when thou hast lost a iewell which was all thy wealth can tell thee where it is and helpe thee to it againe or to him who when thy cause is in triall at the barre will pleade it for thee or to him who when thy health is lost can tell thee how to get it againe then beholde how thou article beholden to a godly minister who when adam had lost both himselfe and thee that iewell of righteousnesse which was and is the whole wealth of thy soule can truly tell thee where it is and howe it is to bee had againe and who when the diuell haleth thee to the barre of god iustice to receiue triall for thy sinnes can drawe thee there such a declaration as the diuell himselfe shall not bee able to answere and who when thy soule is sicke to death and euen to damnation can heale the deadly wounds thereof a good minister therefore is worthy as the apostle saith of double honour whose dutie wee see is to declare vnto man his righteousnesse and to conclude this point also the consideration of the height of this office of a minister may encourage fathers to dedicate their sonnes to this holy calling for the physitians care for the body or the lawyer for thy cause are both inferiour duties to this of the mininister a good lawyer may be one of tenne a good physitian one of a good man one of but a good minister is one of a good lawyer may declare the true state of thy cause a good physitian may declare the true state of thy body no calling no man can declare vnto thee thy righteousnesse but a true minister and thus we see the office or function of a minister now followeth the blessing then will he haue mercy vpon him the fourth generall part of this description is the blessing which god giueth to the labours and function of a true minister then that is when a man by the preaching of the lawe is brought to true humiliation and repentance and by the preaching of the gospell to true faith in the messias then will he that is god haue mercy on him that is on the penitent and beleeuing sinner behold heere the admirable simpathy and the cooperation of god and the ministers office man preacheth and god blesseth man worketh on the heart and god giues grace a minister declares vnto man his righteousnesse and god saith so be it he shall be righteous a minister pronounceth mercy to a penitent sinner and forthwith god hath mercy on him heere wee see the great and glorious account which god makes of the worde of his ministers by them truly taught and rightly applyed namely that he as it were tyeth his blessing vnto it for ordinarily till a man knowe his righteousnesse by the meanes of an interpreter god hath not mercy on him but as soone as he doth knowe it then as we see here god wil haue mercy on him and will say deliuer him ampc this is no small honour to ministers and to their ministerie that god himselfe giues a blessing vnto it amp worketh when they work and as it were staieth wayting when they declare vnto a man his righteousnesse and then hath he mercy on him so powerfull and so effectuall is the worde spoken by a minister of god this is that which christ auoucheth whatsoeuer you loose in earth shall be loosed in heauen will you knowe the meaning hereof reade saint john whose sinnes soeuer you remit they are remitted whose you retaine they are retained will you haue the meaning of both read esay god destroyeth the tokens of soothsayers and makes wisards and astrologers fooles turneth worldly wisemen backward and makes their knowledge foolishnesse but hee confirmeth the word of his servant and performeth the counsel of his messengers thus god bindeth and looseth with them remitteth and retaineth with them by confirming their word and performing their counsell for example a true minister seeth a sinner hardned in his sins amp still rebelling against the will of god he therfore declareth vnto him his vnrighteousnes amp his sin amp denounceth vnto him the misery amp curses of god iustice as due vnto him for the same here he binds on earth here he retains on earth this mans sins are likewise bound amp retained in heauen on the other side hee seeth a man penitet amp belieuing he pronounceth forgiuenes of sins amp happines vnto him for the same he looseth him from the band of his sins by declaring vnto him his righteousnes this mans sins are likewise loosed amp remitted in heauen amp god himselfe doth pronounce him cleare in heauen when the minister doth on earth thus god confirmeth the word of his servant and performeth the counsell of his messengers the vse of this doctrine is first for rulers and great man of this worlde this may teach them to be nursing fathers and nursing mothers vnto the church whose authority they see is so great ouer them as that their decree stands ratified in heauen therefore though their place bee great and they bee god vppon earth yet must they withall acknowledge that in iustifying a sinner in interpretation in declaring vnto man his righteousnes in binding and loosing their power also is immediate from god amp aboue theirs and they themselues as they are man must submit themselues to this powerfull word of the ministers to be taught by it and to be reconciled by meanes of it amp highly must they respect it for though a man speake it yet is it the word of god this is to lick the dust of christs feete which the prophet speaketh of not as the pope would haue it to hold the stirrop amp leade the horse amp hold the water to the pope to kisse his toes to holde their kingdomes of him as tenants at will or by curtesie but reuerently to acknowledge the ordinance to be god the function amp duty to be high amp excellent to acknowledge the power of their keyes and censures being rightly applied their promises amp their threatnings to be as fro god amp to submit to them accordingly secondly ministers theselues here must learne when they take the word of reconciliation into their hands and mouthes to call to minde whose it is euen the lord and that he worketh with them amp hath the greatest hand in the work and that therefore they must vse it in holymaner with much feare and reuerence it is not their owne they may not vse it as they list and lastly hearers are here taught first to see how mad such man be which carelesly and sildome heare sermons but vpon any occasion flye to wisards and charmers which are the diuels prophets for see the difference of these two the wisard and charmer hath societie with the diuell the preacher with god the charmer hath his calling from the diuel the preacher is from god the charmers charme is the diuels watchword when he charmeth the diuell doth the feate the preachers doctrine is god watchword when hee truly applyeth it god himselfe ratifieth and makes it good therefore let all man feare to haue thus to doe with the diuell by seeking to his slaues amp let them draw neere to god by entring into fellowship with his holy prophets and godly ministers and further if when they preach and thou belieuest then god hath mercy on thee then learne what reuerence they and their word is worthy of which is thus accompanied with god mercy and forgiuenes and then learne to heare the word with feare and trembling for it is god word and not theirs and when a true minister saith vnto thee on a true ground i denounce thee a sinfull man and vnder the curse or i declare thee to be righteous and a child of grace it is all one as though god from heauen had said so vnto thee if any man aske but is it not as good if another man pronounce forgiuenesse vnto me vpon my repentance i answere yes vndoubtedly if it be in extraordinarie times or places when there are no ministers for otherwise certainly this blessing is principally tied vnto the ministers calling for it is not said of any priuate mens calling any wher in the scripture as it is heere saide of the ministers if an angell an interpreter come to a man and declare vnto him his righteousnesss then marke the conexion then will god haue mercy on him and will say deliuer him ampc whence comes this blessing from this promise of god if therfore other callings wil challenge ordinarily the same blessing then must they haue the same prosmise besides other christias being priuate man though they be sanctified amp haue a good measure of knowledge yet haue they not the same spirit of discerning that godly ministers haue nor can so fully amp truly iudge when a man hath repented when not and therefore cannot so truly pronounce the sentence of the law or gospel nor haue they abilitie ordinarily by their good conference and christian counsell to conuert a soule but to confirme one conuerted but that power ordinarily belongs to the publike ministery of the word therefore it followeth that ordinarily they haue not the power to pronounce the sentence of binding or loosing vppon any man i confesse in times or places where no minister can be had god blesseth the labours of priuate man that haue knowledge sometimes euen for the conuerting of a man to god amp for comforting him at the houre of death and giues a vertue and power to that sentence which they shal pronounce one vpon anothers repentance but as this is extraordinary and in the want of ordinary ministers so in that case a priuate man of knowledge and godlinesse is made a minister for that time to himselfe or to another euen as a priuate man in cases of extreame danger whe no magistrate is present is made a magistrate himselfe to defend his own life so then as in want of a magistrate the sword of the magistracie is put into the hand of a priuate man so in the want of ministers the keyes of the ministerie are committed and put into the hands of priuate man as in y e dayes of persecution that then they may with comfort admonish amp aduise and with power pronounce mercy and forgiuenesse one vnto another vpon their true repentance yet alwaies remember that in so doing a priuate man is as a minister for that time amp in that case but ordinarily and alwaies in setled churches this power pertaineth to the ministerie amp is theirs alone by ordination and to them belongeth the promise and the blessing that when hee hath declared to a man his righteousnesse then god will haue mercie on him and thus we see also the blessing of god vpon the function of the ministerie amp annexed therunto by the merciful dispensation of god it followeth and will say deliuer him that he goe not downe into the pit for i haue receiued a reconciliation the fift and last part of this description is the commission amp authoritie giuen vnto him which is so great as neuer was giuen to any creature and is this when a minister of god hath declared vnto man his righteousnesse hath brought him to the state of grace and god in his fauour hath had mercie on him then god saith to the minister deliuer that soule from hell for i haue pardoned him in christ i am reconciled to him in which words authoritie is giuen to a minister of god to redeeme a man penitent from hell amp damnation not that hee is the meanes of working out this redemption for that wholy and onely is christ himselfe but hee is god instrument and christs instrument first to apply those meanes vnto him secondly to pronounce his safetie and deliuerance when these means are vsed here is the principall honour of all belonging to that calling and it is the greatest that euer was vouchsafed to any creature man or angel for it is a plaine commission to go and deliuer such a man from the power of hell amp to redeeme him into the state of god children and to make him heire of heauen angels neuer had this commission they are messengers set out for the good of those whom ministers haue redeemed and they haue brought many comfortable messages vnto them but it was neuer said to any angel deliuer that man that he goe not downe into the pit as it heere is saide vnto a minister nor any man but ministers haue this commission to some callings god saith worke thou for man build him houses prouide him sustenance to the phisition heale that man to the lawyer doe that man iustice to the souldier fight for him to the magistrate defend him to the king gouerne him amp see that euery one doe his dutie to none but to the minister doth he say deliuer him that he goe not downe into the pit if this be so then for the vse first ministers must learne heere that if they will haue the honour of redeemers then must they doe the dutie of redeemers they must pray earnestly for the people for that is one meanes whereby they redeeme man they must say with samuel god forbid that i should cease to pray for you they must mourne for the impenitent when they will not turne to god so did dauid his eyes gushed out with river of water because man kept not god law and ieremie who wished a fountaine of water in his eyes that he might weepe for the sinnes of the people they must priuarly conferre visite admonish and rebuke and principally they must preach and that in such good manner and in so diligent measure as that they may redeeme and winne soules and the end that they must ayme at must bee to winne soules some preach for feare of the law to auoyd censure or punishment some for fashion sake that they may bee like to others some for ostentation sake to win credite and praise some for ambition to rise in the world all these forget their commission which is deliuer a man from hell this should bee the end of their preaching to deliuer a soule from hell amp what should commissioners doe but execute their commission high commissioners are worthy to be low commissioners or rather no commissioners if they wil not put it in execution it is therefore lamentable to see that some by not preaching some by vaine preaching shew that they intend any thing rather then the winning of soules to god let then all good ministers so preach as they may say with esay behold lord heere am i and the children whom thou hast giuen me and that they may returne their commission thus whereas thou o lord gauest mee this people and badst mee deliuer them that they goe not downe into hell lord i haue done it it is the thing my soule aymed at with all my desire and endeuour and by thy mercy i haue effected it accordingly and the rather must all christian ministers seriously inted the sauing of soules inasmuch as antichrist doth so earnestly seeke the destruction of soules by winning them to his synagogue the turke spares no labour no cost to infect young children of christians with his impure and blasphemous superstition the pope and his vassals especially iesuits vse al means deuise many stratagems spare no cost nor labor to seduce amp inueagle young man and the best wits surely their care and policie herein is admirable and yet alas when like the pharisies they haue compassed sea and land to make a proselite they make him like themselues the childe of hel and they are so farre from hauing any commission from god to doe this or any blessing promised as contrariwise god forbids them and his curse lyeth vppon them for so doing shall they be so diligent to destroy soules without a commission and incurre god curse for their labour and shall not christian ministers be much more diligent to winne and redeeme soules hauing so large a commission for the purpose and so great a blessing promised thereunto in the next place this doctrine hath vse to the hearers first to let them see the excellencie of this calling which hath a commssion and power to redeeme them from hell and damnation amp what honour is due vnto it and to let the wicked man see which any way abuseth either the persons or the function how base amp vnthankefull man they are to recompence euill for good and therefore no maruell though evil do neuer depart from the houses and families of such man and further to encourage all man to giue theselues to god in this calling for see here what they are euen the high commissioners of god wee haue in our estate a power deligated to certaine man of worth and it is called the high commission because they haue power to doe great things and that man thinkes himselfe happy who can bring his son to this to be thought fit to bee one of this commission but behold heere a higher commission a commission from god to redeeme soules from the power of hell and the diuels clawes this is in deed a high commission and so high as this was neuer granted out of the court of heauen to any creature but to ministers they therefore are the high commissioners of the high god is it not then an honour and happinesse vnto thee to bring thy son to this estate and lastly this must teach all hearers their dutie to god word namely to submit themselues vnto it for if the minister haue a commission to redeeme thy soule it must be by the word amp holy discipline therefore thy dutie is to heare god word patiently to submit thy selfe vnto it to be taught and instructed nay to be checked and rebuked and to haue thy sinnes discouered amp thy corruptions ript vp if thou wouldst haue thy cause succeed wel thy lawyer must discouer the weaknesses of it if thy body to be cured thy physition must purge the corruption of it so if thy soule bee to be redeemed thy minister must see the weaknes amp purge the corruptions of it and though his doctrine be harsh amp hard vnto thy nature and y e discipline of y e gospel seeme rough vnto thee yet must not thou rage and rebel against it nor hate him nor raile at his perso but submit thy selfe vnto it for it is the message and ministerie of thy saluation if otherwise thou doest indeede a great wrong to the minister for thou frustratest his commission but alas a farre greater to thy selfe for thou furstratest thine owne saluation then i said woe is me i am vndone for i am a man of polluted lips and dwell in the midst of a people of polluted lips for my eyes haue seene the king and lord of hostes then flewe one of the seraphins vnto me with a hote coale in his hand which he tooke from the altar with the tonges and touched my mouth and said loe this hath touched thy lips and thy iniquitie shall be taken away and thy sin shall be purged also i heard the voyce of the lorde saying whom shall i send and who shall goe for vs then said i here am i send me and he said goe in the fiue former chapters are cotained such sermons as the prophet had made vnder vzziah king of iuda at this chapter begin such as he preached in the raigne of iotham and so forward but before hee either preach or prophecie of any thing in king iothams dayes or his successors the lord in this chapter giues a newe commission to the prophet amp a newe confirmation to this calling the olde king in whose dayes esayah was first called being now dead amp another succeeding him god with the new king reneweth the calling amp commission of the prophet wherein god doth not giue him another calling for one calling to the office of the ministery is sufficient but hee confirmeth the calling formerly giuen by repeating amp ratifying it and this god did to esay not as he was an ordinarie but an extraordinary prophet for ordinary ministers need no renouation of their calling nor any new signes of cofirmation but extraordinary prophets who come in extraordinary maner amp to doe many extraordinary workes god in his wisdom wil haue their calling confirmed again amp againe amp that by very extraordinary meanes out of which practise of the lord we learne how great cause wee haue to doubt these man to bee either fantasticall or worse who pretend extraordinary callings in these dayes and yet scarce can shew vs any good signes of an ordinary much lesse of an extraordinatie motion for if in those dayes when such courses were more comon god will haue his extraordinary prophets calling to be renued amp cofirmed again amp againe then certainly in these dayes we may iustly require more amp more wonderfull signes of an extraordinary calling afore we belieue it and if god himselfe was so carefull to satisfie his church in those dayes of the vocation of his prophet surely the church in these daies hath much more cause to doubt in such cases and to require many and extraordinary signes afore it acknowledge any such extraordinary calling these man therefore offer much wrong to the church amp deserue both the censure thereof and the sword of the magistrate who dare so boldly offer and obtrude to the church their owne fancies and dreames as extraordinary motions of god spirit this is the occasion and coherence this chapter hath two partes first the meanes of his confirmation from the beginning to these words secondly the confirmation it selfe from these words to the end the meanes of his confirmation is a vision he saw from heauen of certaine holy angels appearing and speaking to him in the first verses in the confirmation which followeth in these words are three points the effect of the vision which i wrought in the prophet it caused him feare it astonisht him and cast him downe in the fifth verse his consolation amp raising vp again after his feare in the and verses the renuing of his commission againe from thence to the end the feare and astonishment of the prophet is described by the signes of which are two a note of exclamation woe is me by a note of extreame deiection in himselfe i am vndone by the causes of it which are also set downe to be two he was a man polluted and dwelt amongst people polluted he had seene the lord then said i woe is me i am vndone the first point in order is the feare amp extasie into which the lord droue his holy prophet which the lord did not in his anger but in his loue vnto him not for a punishment of sinne but as an euidence of his further loue for the intent and purpose of god in striking this feare into him was to inable him to be a true prophet amp a fit messenger for himself it may seeme a strange course which god taketh to confirme amp raise vp his servant in zeale and courage to strike him into an extreame feare euen to astonish and amaze him and yet we see it is the course which the lord taketh out of which practise of the lord we learne this doctrine that all true ministers especially such as are deputed to the greatest works in his church must be first of all striken into a great feare in consideration of the greatnes of their function yes into an amazement and astonishment in the admiration of god glory amp greatnes whose roome they occupy amp whose message they bring amp the more they are afraid and shrinke so it be vnder the contemplation of god maiestie and their owne weaknes the more likelier it is that they are truly cald of god amp appointed for worthy purposes in his church but he that steps to this function without feare he may thrust in himselfe but its doubtfull whether hee bee cald of god as here the prophet was nor is it so here alone but euery where when god called any of his servant to any great worke be first droue the into these feares and a mazements as is euident exod amp in moses in ieremie ieremie in act ampc s paul and others the reason of this dealing of the lord is plaine namely because mans nature is alwayes ready to take enough and too much vnto it selfe god therefore in his wisdome puts a bridle vnto the corrupt nature of ma amp astonisheth it least it presume too much amp take too much vpon it selfe againe a minister is to preach vnto the people feare amp reuerece of the lord but how can he do so to others whe he hath not tyed that bond in his owne conscience nor was euer cast downe in admiration of god glory amp maiestie and lastly the ministery is a high amp excellent calling especially the office of extraordinary prophets in the old testament amp is therefore subiect to pride and to bee puft vp with self conceits amp therefore teacheth the apostle to timothy that a minister may not be a yong scholler least he be puft vp amp fall into the condemnation of the wicked giuing vs to vnderstand that it is y e peculiar danger of that calling to haue high conceits of theselues because of the height amp dignitie of ther function therfore to preuent this incouenience god in mercy appointeth that all his true ministers shall haue some means or other to be cast down euen to nothing in theselues amp shall be driuen into such feares amp amazements at sight of their owne wickednesse as they shal throwe downe themselues at christs feete and denying themselues wholy shal acknowledge that they are in him whatsoeuer they are and doe relye and trust onely on his grace and helpe the vse of this doctrine as it is for all ministers so specially for vs which liue in the vniuersity we liue as it were in a seminary and many of vs are hereafter by god grace to be framed to the ministery and some of vs already are now here we haue many occasions to be puft vp in self conceits we see our selues growe in time in degrees in learning in honour in name and estimation amp to many of vs god giues good portions of his gifts what are all these but so many baites to allure vs to pride amp vaine opinions of our own worths but let vs remeber the end wee aime at is not humane nor carnal our purpose is to saue soules then the weapons of our war must not be carnal as pride vaineglory and self conceit if therefore we euer looke to be made instruments of god glory in sauing of soules then at the first set we not before our eyes the honour but the daunger of our calling and humble we our selues vnder the mightie hand of our god that he may exale vs in his due time and let vs bee content that god giue any occasion or meanes to pul vs down either by outward crosse or inward temptation and let vs reioyce when wee are thereby so farre cast downe that wee cry out in the astonishment of our spirits as the prophet heere woe is mee i am vndone but otherwise if wee will needes followe the swinge of our proude natures and trust in our owne abilitie gifts and learning let vs knowe wee vse carnall weapons in a spirituall warfare and let vs bee assured the lord will worke no great worke in his church by our ministerie wee may raise our selues in worldly estimation and worke out our owne purposes but we shal do little in the saluation of soules for those man doe pronounce the most powerfull blessings on other mens soules and speake the best wordes of comfort to other mens consciences which oftenest say vnto themselues woe is mee i am vndone furthermore whereas the prophet at this vision and reuelation of god glory vnto him cryeth out of himselfe woe is mee i am vndone being wordes of extreame feare and astonishment and of so lowe a deiection as is a degree towards desperation if it had gone forward let vs learne that the prophet helde not in his iudgement the doctrine of intercession of angels and saints for particular man for if hee had hee neede not at the sight of god maiestie foorthwith to haue cryed out woe is mee i am vndone but hee might haue stayed himselfe a while in this cogitation i will desire moses samuel or dauid to pray to this glorious god for mee or heere are holy angels of the seraphins here present they see in what fearefull case i am i will pray to them to speake to this glorious and mightie lorde for mee that i perish not in this feare but hee instantly seeing the lorde appeare in maiestie and fearing his iust wrath being guiltie of his owne corruptions without any hope or expectation or as he seemes without the least cogitation of helpe or assistance from any creature he cryeth out i am vndone lastly whereas hee exclaimeth woe is mee i am vndone being words of a soule humbled and deiected and hereby sheweth himselfe to bee in that case which a poore sinner is when the preaching of the lawe hath humbled him by shewing him his sinnes and his extreame daunger by them wee may learne that to bee called to the mnisterie is to be as it were conuerted and regenerate and that when a man is called thereunto it is a worke little lesse then that whereby god calleth a sinner from his sinne to the state of repentance for as god first casteth downe the sinner before hee giue him grace or any feeling of his loue in christ so heere hee first abaseth and casteth downe the prophete in the sight of god maiestie and his owne miserie afore hee honour him with a commission to preach his word vnto his people which i note against those man which holde it so ordinary a matter to enter into the ministerie as many doe which take it vppon them in worldly and politic purposes and some of a better ranke which thinke if a man haue learning degrees and age hee is sufficiently qualified for that calling but alas this is not all there is a greater worke to be wrought then so hee must be humbled and cast down in sight of the greatnesse of that calling of the maiestie of that god whose roome hee is to execute and of the vnworthinesse of himselfe to so great a worke hee must be resolued that to call a man to the ministerie is the greatest worke that god worketh in his church but the conuerting of a sinner and calling him to the state of grace nay it is a worke euen like vnto it for as a sinner in his conuersion so hee at his vocation to that place is often to cry out in the amazement of his soule woe is mee i am vndone as therefore they are fouly deceiued which thinke any holinesse or sanctification can sufficiently qualifie a man without learning so are they no lesse which thinke all outward complements to bee sufficient without this worke which heere was wrought in the holy prophet thus causes of we see the feare amp astonishment of the his feare prophet it followeth for i am a man of polluted lippes now follow the causes of his feare which are two the first is his owne pollution and sinfulnesse and the sinfulnesse of his people his own he freely confesseth in these words i am a man of polluted lippes that is i am a miserable and sinfull man and therefore i feare and tremble to stand in god presence nay i dare not looke vpon the lorde for my sinnes but it may be demaunded how could the prophet say thus truely for he was a holy man and iustified in god prefence by his true faith in the messias and sanctified by repentance can a man iustified and sanctified say he is a man polluted i answere it is doubtlesse he was so he therefore complaineth here not of any great and enormous sinnes which hee had committed to the publike scandall of the church but first of the corruptio of his nature which in him as in all man is a very sea of iniquity amp which alwaies appeares the more the neerer a man comes to god and therefore did now most apparantly discouer it selfe in the prophet when he was in the presence of the lord himself secondly he complaineth of some actual sins of his life and it is more likely of some sins of omission then of comission for we find not that the prophet was euer touched with any great sin amp where we know it not we are in charitie not to imagine it so that it is most probable hee complaineth of some smaller faults or negligences in his ministery as not preaching to the people at some time when he ought or not preaching so willingly or cheerfully as he should or desire to leaue preaching because the people were stubborne amp disobedient or some impatience in his ministery when the people were rebellious and resisted his doctrine which passion might the rather vexe him as we read it did ieremy the iewes were so stubborne amp stifnecked a people or it may be some want of zeale or forwardnes these or some such were the cause of his feare and the coscience of these makes him here cry out that he cannot stand in the sight of god where we learn first what a tender conscience godly ministers must haue aboue all man namely that they must make conscience not of the great and grosse sins onely but euen of the lowest amp least sins and he must endeuour in his calling not only to be cleere of great crimes but as far as may be to bee free from the least appearance of euill and from the least negligences in his place for a small faultin other man is great in them and that which may be some waies pardonable in other man is no way in them they must therefore watch ouer themselues most carefully and take heede to all their waies amp for this ende is it that a minister in godly wisedome must often depriue himselfe euen of many things which it may be lawfully hee might vse least his liberty be an occasion of euill to others and must abstaine from the least sins least euen they be blemishes to his calling and burthens to his conscience and hence is it that a minister cannot be too carefull in his calling in his words diet company recreation apparel gestures and in his whole carriage because little sins are so great in the especially ministers must here learne the apostles lesson to bee instant in season and out of season to preach and exhort to comfort and rebuke publikely and priuately to good to bad when it is wel taken when it is ill taken when they willingly receiue it and when they stubbornly resist it when they commend him and reward him and when they raile at him and persecute him for it thus must he be diligent in season and out of season for the least negligence in his dutie or omitting the least opportunity of doing good will when god visits his conscience bee a burthen and vexation to him as it was heere to the prophet and furthermore if these smal sinnes thus afflicted the prophet then alas what is to be thought of those ministers who make no conscience of foule and scandalous sinnes how shall symonie incontinencie vsury inhospitality couetousnesse ignorance idlenesse carelesse nonresidencie how shall these i say and other like grieuous crimes oppresse amp burthen the soule when as the smallest sins doe so affright this holy man surely whe god shal visite them their states will bee most fearefull nor shall any mans case be so miserable as an vncoscionable ministers and thogh nowe such loose and licentious ministers seeme to liue in iolitie amp without any feare yet when god shall appeare vnto their conscience then will they cry out in fearefull anguish woe is me i am vndone and againe if these smal faults so affrighted this holy prophet amp burdened his conscience then what pittifull consciences haue those ministers whose daily negligence and vnconscionable carelessenesse in their places is such as all man speake of and yet they are not touched surely these man are not of so tender cosciences as the prophet was amp either the prophet here was much more nice then needed or else these man will proue to be in a miserable estate lastly let ministers of care and conscience be here comforted in the example of the prophet who is there but may find imperfections and blemishes in himselfe which will often make him cry out woe is me but let not that discomfort them but rather reioyce that they can see their owne weaknes as the prophet did here if they haue cause to exclaime against themselues they are not alone it was this and all other holy prophets case before them in hauing imperfections in themselues they are no more miserable then the prophet was but let them labour to be as blessed in seeing amp complaining of themselues as hee was and let euery minister assure himselfe that the more hee makes conscience euen of the least sinnes of all the more he resembleth the ancient holy prophets amp the more likely is he to worke effectually in his ministery for his duty is to worke in his people a conscience not of great sinnes onely but euen of all but how can he doe that in them if he haue not first of all done it in himselfe hence it is therefore that godly ministers finde fault with themselues when other man cannot and cry out against themselues for their pollutions with the prophet here when no other man can accuse them of the least crime nay when other doe magnifie god for his graces on them and praise their giftes and commend their good liues euen then doe they condemne themselues and exclaime against their owne corruptions and their owne smallest negligences or omissions are great wounds to their consciences and their least sinnes and their most pardonable infirmities are sore burthens vnto them for of all man in the worlde a godly minister is a man of the most tender conscience hitherto hath the prophet complained generally of his pollution particularly hee exclaimeth against the pollution of his lippes but why will some say complaines hee of the pollution of his lippes rather then of his heart or his hands or any other part of him were they not all polluted yes all in some measure and was not he grieued at them all yes assuredly wee must grant that also but the reason is he was a prophet his dutie was to vse his tongue the practise of his calling consisted in the vse of his tongue for a minister is an interpeter as he is called iob that is the peoples to god by prayer and god to the people by preaching he is god mouth and the peoples mouth so that the tongue of a minister is that part of his body which is to be vsed as a principall instrument of god glory and more to the setting foorth of his honour then any other now euery man is to be tryed what he is by his calling rather then by any other accidentall or collaterall courses therefore the honour or dishonour of a minister is the vse or the abuse of his tongue and his comfort or discomfort is the well vsing or not vsing of it the prophet therefore here affrighted at god prefence and therefore retyring into himselfe presently his conscience checkes him for his most proper sins namly for some fault or negligence in his ministerie which is the proper sinne of that calling and therfore is it that he exclaimeth against the pollutions of his lippes out of which practise of his we may learne first the vanitie of the papists who magnifie the merites of holy mens workes for if this holy prophet a man truly iustified amp extraordinarily sanctified yet durst not stand before god in this little apparance of his glory notwithstanding all his zeale and courage and conscience and paines and sufferings in his function but was cast downe so farre from a conceit of his owne worth that hee cryed out woe is mee i am vndone how then can wee who are no better but much worse then hee stand before god in the day of iudgement in the great appearing of his infinite iustice and glorie rather doubtlesse as here the smallest pollution of his lippes and negligence in his calling droue him out of all conceit of merit when once hee came into the presence of god so the due consideration of our so many and foule pollutions aboue his should beate downe all proude conceites of our owne goodnesse when wee appeare before god it is therefore to bee feared that the papists who thus magnifie their owne merits doe seldome or neuer enter into earnest consideration of their owne infirmities doe seldome persent themselues in the presence of god maiestie for if they did then doubtlesse the least sight of their least pollutio would make them farre from euer thinking of their own merits they also tell vs of workes of superrogation but it seemes heere this holy prophet had none of them and they teach a man may in this life perfectly fulfill the lawe but who can doe it i not ministers and what ministers if not extraordinary prophets and yet isaiah the first and chiefe of them exclaimeth here in pittiful manner against his pollutions doubtlesse if the papists would cease flattering themselues and not examine their consciences by their own pleasing corruption but present themselues in the face and presence of god maiestie they would bee farre from these conceits in the next place whereas the prophet complaineth of the pollution of his lippes as of the peculiar sinne of his place ministers are heere taught to auoide that sinne aboue all other and to labour in that dutie aboue any other for the dooing of it is his most comfort the want of it is his most vexation his tongue is the instrument giuen him to honour god if hee vse it well it yeeldes him comfort more then any other duties but if he vse not or abuse his tongue the pollution of his lippes will bee the heauiest burthen of all they therefore are greatly deceiued who thinke a minister to discharge sufficiently his duetie though hee preach not if he keepe good hospitalitie and make peace amongst his neighbours and performe other workes of charatie and good life for if a minister haue not this vertue hee hath none if hee preach not if hee abuse his lippes or if hee open them not hee hath no conscience nor can haue any comfort for that is the principall dutie of a minister though all the other bee required to make him compleate the want of them may condemne him before man but it is the pollution of his lippes which presently checkes him before god as we see here in this holy prophet the conclusion then is to euery minister that if hee had all the vertues and good properties that can commend a man in the world yet if his lippes be polluted either by not preaching or by negliget idle or carelesse preaching this pollution will so staine his conscience and so burthen him in the presence of god that the time will come notwithstanding al his other good qualities he will cry out in farre more pittifull maner the here the prophet doth woe is i am vndo because i am a an of polluted lippes it followeth and i dwell in the midst of a people of polluted lippes the prophet not onely complaines of his own pollution but of his peoples also amongst whom he liued and this he doth for these causes first to teach vs that it is the ministers duty to confesse not onely his owne sinnes but the sinnes of his people amp to complaine of them to god for as he is the peoples interpretar to god he must not thinke it enough to put vp their petitions to vnfolde their wants amp craue reliefe for them at god hand but hee must further take knowledge of the sins of his people and make both publique and priuate confession of them to god and the more particularly he can doe this the better and this hee is to doe both for the peoples good and for his owne also because it cannot be but the sinnes of his people are in some sort his for this is the peculiar danger of the magistrates and ministers ling that generally the sinnes of their people are theirs i meane that they are accessarie to the sinnes of their people either by prouoking them by their evil example or by not reprouing or not hindring or suffering or winking or couering amp concealing or not punishing them or not carefully enough vsing meanes to preuent them by all which meanes and many more it comes to passe that the peoples sinnes are the ministers by communication so that as well for his owne sake as theirs hee is to confesse to god their sinnes as well as his owne now if a minister must confesse his peoples sinnes then it followeth confequently that he must know them and take notice of them for else hee cannot confesse them and this is one cause why the holy ghost commands a pastor to know his flocke he must not onely haue a flocke and knowe which is his flocke or haue a generall ye ouer it out hee must haue a particular and knowledge of the state of it nd the more particular the better and if the minister ought to know and confesse his peoples sinnes then if followeth first that it is best for a minister to bee present with his people that so hee may the better know them and their state and certainly if it be a ministers dutie to confesse to god the pollutions of his people then wilfull and carelesse nonresidency and all absence without iust and conscionable causes must needs be a foule amp fearefull sin for how could isayah haue cofessed that his people were a people of polluted lips but that he dwelt amongst them nay saith the prophet he dwelt in the midst among them indeede well may hee know and confesse his peoples pollutions that dwelles in the midst amongst them againe if the minister be to confesse his peoples sinnes and therefore must needs knowe them then it followeth also that they must discouer amp confesse them vnto him or else not possible he should perfectly kno e their estate the want of this is a great fault in our churches for how euer we condemne auricular confession as a very pollicie in the deuisers and as a rack to the consciences of poore christians yet we not onely allowe but call and for that confession wherby a christian voluntarily at all times may resort to his pastor and open his estate and disburden his conscience of such sins as disquiet him and craue his godly assistance and holy prayers great blessing and comfort doth doubtlesse followe them that vse this godly practise and the want of it is cause that a minister canot discerne the state euen of his own flock nor can complaine to god of their pollutions and confesse their sinnes so particularly as would be good both for him and them secondly the prophet couples together his own pollution and the pollutions of his people as the adjuvant or helping cause amp the effect for the pollution of a people helpes forward the pollution of a minister and the worse people they are the worse doe they make him though he be otherwise neuer so good for euen the prophet though called of god himself amp iustified and sanctified amp a man of extraordinary grace yet dwelling in y e midst of a people so stubborne amp disobedient as the iewes were was something touched with their pollutions ministers euen the best are man and this comes to passe by reason of the corruption of their nature as they are me the nature of which corruption is to apprehend any euill where euer it findes it and to partake with it regeneration qualifieth amp abates this corruption but takes it not away perfectly in this life whereby it comes to passe that a minister liuing amongst euill people cannot but be somwhat stained with their pollution of what sort soeuer they be insomuch as it is often seene that one knowne to be otherwise disposed of himselfe is found to bee disposed to this or that euill by liuing amongst a people so disposed and againe that a minister in such a place and amongst such people free from such and such sinnes remoued to another place is there found more or lesse tainted with them because they abound amongst the people and yet further that a minister knowne to bee faithfull painfull and zealous amp comming to a disobedient stubborne froward or prophane amp dissolute people his faith is weakened his zeale amp courage abated god graces in him dulled amp much decayed godly ministers doe daily complaine hereof and experience euery where shewes it too true out of this we may learne something both for our instruction and for our conuersation for our instruction it here appeares how wicked and wretched the corruption of our nature is which cannot but receiue some contagion from the pollution of those with whom we liue for this is so not onely in them who carry a loose hand ouer themselues but euen in such as looke most narrowly vnto their steps as wee see here in this holy prophet who was a man of more then ordinary sanctification how litle cause therfore hath any man to extoll nature and how much lesse cause the schoolemen and some other papists to giue the least commendation to our pure naturals for if nature rectified by grace be so hardly kept within compasse alas how outragious amp peruerse is it when it raignes without controlment and for our further instruction heere wee may see of what a creeping and incroaching nature sinne is which like a secret venome in the naturall bodie so it in the pollitique body restes not in the place or partie poisoned but closely creepes amp diffuseth it selfe into euery part and member of the whole it creepes from man to man yes from an evil man to a good from the worst man to the best from prophane man to godly ministers and as from publique persons as magistrates and ministers it descendeth visibly and the example of their evil life is palpably scandalous so from the people to the magistrate or minister it creepeth closely amp ascendeth in more secret and insensible manner yet in the effect it is too sensible for it is alwayes seene that they are something touched with their peoples pollutions sinne is not onely as a poison spreading from the heart to all parts from the minister to the people but as a gangreue if it begin in the foot wil without speedy preuention spred priuily to the hart so sinne shewes it selfe euen from the people to the ministers so great cause is there for all man to stop sinne in the beginning to breake it in the egge to giue water no passage no not a little for let this gangreue beginne at the feete it will not rest till it be in the heart for our conuersation wee are heere taught first if a minister by reason of the corruption of his owne nature and the creeping nature of sinne is in such danger to be stained with the peoples pollutions then let all ministers desire and vse all good meanes to dwell with a people as litle polluted as may be otherwise let him assure himselfe to be polluted with them which is both a great discofort to his owne conscience as here it was to the prophet and disgrace to his profession for if it be a dutie of euery good professor of religion to keepe himselfe vnspotted of the world then how much more is it the ministers duetie so to doe and how foule a staine is it to the honour of his calling to be polluted in the common pollutions of his people it may bee therefore good counsell to all godly ministers in the placing amp disposing of themselues not to enquire onely how good a liuing such and such a place is how wel seated how healthfull and beneficiall it will bee which are alas the common amp almost the onely questions now adayes but principally to regard what a people they be and how affected amongst whome they are to liue if godly and wel disposed or at least tractable and gentle amp willing to be taught the lesse to regard other incommodities but if wicked and prophane or which is worse stubborne froward and vntractable then lesse to regard the greatest commodity amp certainly if this point be well considered of and how bitter it hath beene in the ende to many who haue not regarded it it will appeare that this is the best encouragement or discouragement the greatest commoditie or discommoditie and the best reason either to win a ma to a place or to drawe him from it how good soeuer it be otherwayes they that neglect this dutie and are led or misled rather with carnall and wordly respects how iust is it vpon the when they are made to cry in the sorrowe of their soule w e is me i dwell in the midst of a people of polluted lippes and here such ministers as haue poore liuings but good people let them not faint nor bee discouraged they haue more cause to blesse god then to be grieued for doubtlesse they are farre better the those who haue great liuings and an euill people but as for those to whom god hath bene so good as to bestowe vpon them competent liuings and a willing and well disposed people let them thinke themselues double blessed of god and treble bound to honour god amp to doe good in his church and if such man goe not before their brother in al ministerial care and dutie their fault is aboue al mens amp they make themselues vnworthy of so great mercies againe if that a polluted people pollutes their minister here is a good warning for al ministers to be wary amp choyse of their company with whom they will most priuately conuerse for as on the one side they may not retire themselues into solitarinesse nor sequester theselues from all societie with their people which is rather a cimicall and fantasticall then any way a religious practise so of all man are they to be most carefull that they doe not loosely and lauishly bestow themselues on all company as too many doe in our church to the great scandall therof who care not with whom they conuerse but all company all places all times all sportes amp recreations al meetings all occasions are one with them but alas what maruel though such man keepe not theselues vnspotted of the world but proue too offensiue to their calling for seeing the best me cannot liue with the best people but they shall receiue some contagion from them how carefully ought ordinary ministers to make difference of man and meetings times and places and not diffusedly amp carelesly to thrust themselues into all so doing shall they keepe their calling from much reproach amp preserue themselues from much pollution which otherwise from their polluted people they shal be sure to receiue and here people are to be admonished not too sharpely to censure their ministers though hee bee not so sociable with them all as it may bee many would expect for it concerns no man to be so warie of his company and his sports as it doeth the minister and if they would haue comfort and honour by their minister let them bee carefull into what recreations amp company they draw or desire him for the more polluted the people are amongst whom he liues the more carefull must he bee to keepe himself cleare from their pollutions lastly here people are taught not to be too sharpe condemners of those ministers whose conuersations are not so vnblameable as were to be wished for as they liue ill generally the cause is because they liue amongst an il people why then should they so much condemne them for such faults as wherein themselues haue made them faultie i say not but our church and state and ministerie are to censure such man and it were good they did it more but it is against all reason the people should do so wheras themselues are the cause of it for alas if this holy prophet was a man of polluted lippes because hee dwelt with a people of polluted lippes what maruell then though ordinary ministers be polluted with the common and vniuersall pollutions of their people people therefore are first of all to see that themselues bee well ordered and godly and then iustly may they complaine if the liues of their ministers be not agreeable but otherwise it is not possible without very special grace of god but that a minister shalbe more or lesse touched w t those crimes which are the comon faults of his people and lamentable experience daily lets vs see that where a people in a town is giuen to drunkennesse there the minister is either so for company or at least too good a fellow where a people are giuen to contention there the minister hath too many fuites where the people be popish there the minister is too superstitious where the people bee ignorant there the minister is no great clarke where the people are giuen to any great sinne there the minister generally is not cleare from the same pollution and it is seene that the best ministers amp most carefull of all doe complaine bitterly of the pollutions of their people for that how soeuer it may bee they escape partaking with their sins yet they alwayes finde at the least a dulling amp decaying of god graces in themselues where the people are vntoward and disobedient if therefore a minister liues with such a people his case is pittifull and daungerous for he walkes in the midst of nets and snares which are layd for him on euery side and if he escape them i meane if hee keepe himselfe vnspotted in the midst of a spotted amp polluted people his care and his conscience is worthy both admiration and imitation and himselfe is worthy double honour as being both a zealous minister and a holy man but he who god hath blessed with a good and tractable people and wel affected to the worde and yet himselfe liueth loosely amp scandalously amongst them a heauy burden and a hard account lyeth on that minister and no rebuke is too rough no punishment too great no censure too sharpe for him and if this holy prophet feare so much the presence of god for his small pollutions and yet liued amongst so wicked and polluted a people then what heauinesse and horror shall bee heaped on his soule who cares not with how foule pollutions his life be stained and yet liueth amongst a godly amp wel disposed people and thus wee haue the first cause of his feare his owne and his peoples pollutions it followeth and mine eyes hath seene the king and lord of hostes the second cause of the prophets feare and astonishment is he san the lorde who then appeared in glory vnto him not that hee sawe the substance of god for that is invisible and incomprehensible but his glory nor the fulnesse of his glory for that cannot be endured but a glimse of it nor that with the eies of his body in ordinary manner but in a vision wherein how farre the eyes of his body were vsed neither the prophet expresseth nor wee can well conceiue the meaning then is in a vision hee sawe such glorie and majestie as hee knewe there was an extraordinary presence of the lord of hostes who is the king of glorie at whose sight and thought of his presence instantly his conscience is smitten with feare for his own infirmities and the pollutions of his people wherein let vs first of all obserue the connexion and dependance of these two causes one vpon another for as they are both ioyntly the cause of his feare so one of the is in a sort the cause of another he feareth because of his own and his peoples sinnes and because he sawe the lord but why is he afraid to see the lord the cause thereof is his owne and their sins without which he would neuer haue beene affraid but rather haue gloried to see the lord but his conscience checking him for some defect of dutie in his calling therfore he trembleth at the least glimse of god glory here let vs marke the ground of his reason which is this that man that is in his sinnes is not able to stand in the presence of god this is a generall and certaine truth amp the reasons of it are first the contrarietie between god and the nature of sinne it being the onely thing which offends him amp which prouokes his wrath and iust displeasure therefore as a subiect cannot but be much amazed if he hap to come into the kings presence with any thing about him which the king hates or cannot abide to see so a man cannot but be extreame astonisht if hee knowe himselfe to bee in god presence with his sinnes which god soule hateth secondly sin makes a man indebted to god for as the lawe tyeth him first to obedience so if he sin and faile in that it bindes him to punishment and the more a man sinneth the deeper is he in god debt if then in this world a man willingly indures not the sight of him in whose debt hee is what maruell though a poore sinner tremble at the presence of god to whom he hath forfaited soule and all thirdly sin is that which prouoketh god to therefore a sinfull man feareth the presence of god as a traitor the face of the prince or a malefactor of the judge for these causes a wicked man endures not god presence now god presence hath diverse degeees first god is present to our coscience when we thinke of him he is present when wee name him or heare him named or mentioned by others and these are the surthest off thirdly god is neerer vnto vs in the presence of his ordinances as his word and sacraments and publike seruice in the congregation fourthly there is a most apparant and sensible presence of god which shall bee at the last iudgement when all man shall stand before him in his immediat presece to receiue their iudgement now all these presences of god are hatefull to a wicked man for the first a wicked man by his good will neuer thinkes of god and if sometime a thought of god like lightning flashes in his minde presently he quencheth it as being a most vnwelcome and burdensome thought vnto him therefore saith dauid the wicked is so proud he careth not for god neither is god in all his thoughts nay god himself is so little thought on by them that they will willingly thinke of nothing that might bring god into their thoughts as namely god great works of his wonderfull iudgements of whom the same prophet saith in the same place thy iudgements are farre aboue out of his sight as if hee had said hee labours to set them farre from the eye of his minde that hee may neuer haue occasion to thinke of them nor on god by them that this is true for his thoughts i haue endeuored thus to proue by god owne testimonies because thoughts cannot be discerned by man but alas for the second that is for his wordes thats too apparant in the sight of all man for obserue it and you shall neuer see a wicked man by his good will haue god in his mouth vnlesse it bee to abuse his name by swearing or blasphemie nor willingly doth he heare any other man talke or discourse largely of god or of his greatnesse and his iustice but such talke is tedious amp combersome vnto him and if hee cannot breake it off with other discourse then he sits as mute as a fish and inwardly either frets with anger or is tormented with feare all this is true in faelix the gouernour who whilst paul discoursed of righteousnesse temperance and iudgement to come the text saith in the meane time he trembled and for the third we see daily wicked man endure not god presence in the church for nothing is more troublesome vnto the then many sermons often praying and much receiuing of the sacrament amp therfore they neuer come to the church nor receiue ofter then the lawe layes vpon them but further then that as the psalmist saith they neuer call vpon god but as for the last that they feare and abhorre aboue all they wish in their hart it may neuer be and therfore s paul makes it a token of a true beleeuer and a holy man to loue and looke for the appearing of iesus christ whereupon it followeth that eue so it is a signe of a wicked man to feare the last iudgement amp to wish it might neuer be and when it comes indeed amp they see they cannot escape it what the do they euen cry to the mountaines fall vpon vs and to the hils couer vs and hide vs from what from the presence of god so fearefull and so hatefull is god prsence to a sinfull man besides these there is another way whereby god sheweth his presence and that is by extraordinary reuelation of his glory immediately which was vsual in the old testament as here to the prophet but now is not to bee expected but how terrible that is to the sinfull nature of man appeares in this place for if the prophet a most holy man whose conscience accused him but of a fewe and small sinnes yet thus cryes out amazed amp affrighted at the reuelation of some part of god glory alas how would they be terrified with it whose consciences are burdened with great and grieuous sinnes amp that without repetance thus we see the ground of his reason how true it is that a man in his sin cannot cheerefully come nor boldly stand in god presence the vse of this doctrine first of all let vs see the monstrous presumption of such minister as dare venture rashly into the ministery to tread vpo the holy groud of god with vncleane feete to handle the holy things of god with vnwashen hands for what is it to enter into the ministery but to enter into the chamber of presence of the great king and should not a man look about him afore he come there therefore if god rebuked moses for stepping too hastily towardes the bushe where his presence is and saide come not too neere for the place wher thoustadest is holy ground then how will god rebuke and checke the consciences of such carnall man as carelesly amp carnally rush into the pulpit and to god holy table where god is present in a farre more excellent manner then hee was in the bush and if they bee so to be blamed who enter into this calling without feare and reuerence then how much more faulty are they who beeing ministers dare venture to preach or minister the holy sacraments without holy and priuate preparation amp sanctification of themselues but rush vpon them as vpon common amp prophane actions whereas god is present there in a most holy and glorious maner these man sure wil say the prophet heere was of too nice a conscience but fearefully and terribly shall god appeare at last vnto such man as care not how they appeare in his holy presence secondly this sheweth the reason of the practise of al christian churches who vse to pray before the sermon amp after namely not for decorum onely amp to grace the action but to sanctifie and to humble our selues because then we come before god presence they therfore doe not thinke reuerently enough of god and his presence who doe by their practise in any sort make way to the contrary thirdly we may here learne the pittifull case of those ministers who are so presumptuous as to exercise that holy function amp yet remain their sinnes without repentance what doe these man they approach to the burning bush with their shooes on their feete that is into god presence in their sinnes what shall come of it in the end surely that burning fire shal consume the the least sinne amp smallest negligences affrighted this holy prophet when he should goe into god presence but these man dare come into the sanctuarie of god yes dare take god word in their mouths and yet hate to bee reformed and doe cast the glorious word of god behinde their backes which they preach to others with their mouthes these man may wonder at this holy prophets nicenes or else al the world may wonder at their prophanenesse a little pollution of his lippes feared him to come into god presence but these dare doe it with eies eares lippes feet hands hart and all polluted their eyes polluted with carelesse looking at all vanities their eares with hearing and their lips with speaking wanton amp wicked talk their feete with running into wicked company their hands with practizing and their harts with deuising and consenting to all wickednesse this is the cause why the labours of such man are almost vnprofitable because they dare come into god presence in their sinnes in many places of our land ther is by god blessing much teaching yet there is little reformation in the liues of the most but contrariwise some fal to atheisme some to papisme some into foule sinnes not to be named amongst ghristians where is the cause surely not in the gospell nor in our doctrine nor in the teaching of it but one very principall cause is many ministers come into god presence vnsanctified amp in their sins not caring how loosely they liue in the face of their people and therfore god in iustice thogh he instantly smite not them with visible vengeance for their presumption yet he smites the people with spirituall blindnesse that they regard not their doctrine but looke at their liues and doe rather follow the prophanenesse of the one then the holinesse of the other ministers are such in whome god will be sanctified therefore because they doe not so but dishonour him by coming into his presence in their sinnes therefore hee cannot abide them nor giue any blessing to their labours all ministers therfore as they would see any fruite of their ministerie let them first sanctifie themselues amp clense their hearts by repentance afore they presume to stand vp to rebuke sinne in others else let them not thinke that their golden wordes shall doe so much good as their leaden liues shall doe hurt and they may happe to confirme man that already are conuerted but hardly shall any such man conuert any soules from popery or prophanesse and it is a vaine conceite for man to imagine ther is any force in eloquence or humane learning to ouerthrow that sin in others which ruleth and raigneth in themselues our church and all reformed churches may make vse of this doctrine for it is the glory of a church to haue their doctrine powerfull amp effectuall for the winning of soules therfore it cocerneth them to take order as well that their ministers be godly man as good schollers amp their liues inoffensiue as wel as their doctrine sound or else they will find in woful experience that they pull down as much with the one hand as they build vp with the other but most neerely this doctrine toucheth ministers themselues who must know their case is most feareful of all mens if they come into god presence in their prophanenesse for as no man is more honourable then a learned and holy minister so none more contemptible in this world none more miserable for that to come then he that by his loose amp lewde life doth scandalize his doctrine and let him assure himselfe that for his presumption in rushing into god presence in his sinnes he shall in this world be cast out as vnsauory salt and troden downe of man with the foot of contempt and in the world to come he shall aboue all man cry out in most extreame torment of conscience w is me that my eyes must see the king and lord of hostes and so because hee would not in this world come into god presence in sanctification and holinesse he shal therefore in feare and horror be haled into the presence of god glorie at the last day there to receiue the iust sentence of his condemnation lastly all painfull and godly ministers may receiue comfort not to bee discouraged or driuen from god presence because of their corruptions or infirmities for wee see it was the prophets case but let them still approach in feare and reuerence and be so farre from being driuen from their duty because they being sinfull man dare not come into god presence without much feare as let them contrariwise be assured that the more they tremble at god presence here the lesse shall they feare it at the last day and when prophane and vngodly man who in this world feared not to stand in god presence in their horrible sins shall cry to the mountaines fall vpon vs and hilles couer vs and hide vs from the presence of god then such ministers as in this world in feare and trembling and alwaies in repentance did approach into god presence shall then looke vp and lift vp their heads amp shall say to the holy angels amp all the powers of heauen helpe vs and hasten vs to come into the glorious presence of our god and sauiour and thus we see the manisold vse of this doctrine to our church and ministerie secondly in asmuch as here the prophet in a conscience of his corruptions feareth and cryeth out at the least apparition of god glory the vanitie and false dealing of the church of rome is here discoured in whose legeds amp stories of their saints nothing is more common then apparitions from heauen of saints depa ted of glorious angels of the virgin mary and that so familiarly as sometime she sang with the in their cell kissed some of them and let them sucke her brests nay of god himselfe and especially of our sauiour christ iesus who they say appeared i knowe not how oft to one man namely to saint francis and appeared as he was crucified with his woundes and imprinted those woundes of his in francis his body which they say he bare all his life and that they bled whensoeuer hee would suffer them which he alwayes did on good fryday that hee might be like to christ thus ampc many more such may yousee in that fabulous amp blasphemous book of the conformities of s francis but for the matter are apparitions from heauen so ordinary in the popish church how then came it to passe that the greatest and holiest man in the olde testament were so amezed at the very apparition but of an angell as wee may see in the whole course of the storie some ranne away and hidde themselues some couered their faces some fell flat on the grounde and the prophets heere cryed out woe is mee i am vndone my eyes haue seene the king and lorde of hostes but in the church of rome looke the stories that saint or monke is no body that hath not had some apparition either of the virgin marie or some of the apostles or an angel or christ iesus appearing and talking with them and yet alas peter lames and john those three great pillars they were as good as beside themselues at the appearing of a little part of the glorie of christ in his transfiguration either therefore must it followe that these man haue no sinne in them which dare and can behold god glory so easily and so ordinarily which is impossible or rather which indeed is truth it appeares that these are but deceitfull fancies and forgeries of their owne deuise to deceiue the world and to magnifie themselues before the eyes of the common people for it is first of all most false that apparitions are so common as they make them for if they were then are they more ordinary in the newe testament then in the olde for whereas the scripture hath one their legions haue twenty amp whereas one namely saint paul was once rapt into heauen they haue that were rapt thither and as that is false so is it impossible that any man cloathed with flesh can endure an extraordinary apparition of god glorie without extreame amazement as is plaine herd in the prophet who i hope was as holy a man as the holiest monke that euer was i haue noted this that young diuines may be occasioned to looke a litle into their fabulous legends that so they may discouer the false trickes and iugling castes of that religion which euill shiftes it needed not if it were of god thirdly the people may here learne first in that god presence is so glorious and fearefull to mans nature how mercifully god hath delt with them in teaching them not by himself or by his angels from heaue which they could neuer endure but by man who are like themselues and how vaine and fond these man are who would bee taught from heauen amp not by man who are so full of wants in the olde testament when the people receiued the law from god owne mouth it is saide they ran away and cryed out why should we die if we heare the voyce of god any more wee shall dye for what flesh euer heard the voice of the liuing god amp liued therefore they said to moses goe thou neare and heare al that the lord shal say amp declare thou vnto vs what god saith to thee amp we wilheare it amp doe it and then saith the text y e lord said i heard the words of this people they haue said well in al that they haue spoken and so from that day forward god ordinarily taught his church by man like themselues amp we see y t the beginning of it was not in iudgement but in mercie vnto them it is therefore the dutie of all man both to acknowledge this mercy of god in due thankfulnesse and withall to remember when they see infirmities in ministers that they are but man and that if they had not the ministery of man howe hard it would goe with them considering that the least measure of god owne presence cannot be endured by any man inasmuch as god presence is so glorious in it self and fearefull to our nature al man are taught to prepare themselues by holy prayer by humisiation and confession of their sinnes and vnworthinesse afore they come to god word or sacraments for they come at that time into god presence they therefore are not to come in their securitie nor in their ordinarie sinnes vnrepented of least god strike their consciences with a sence of his fearefull displeasure amp make them cry out vpon farre greater cause then here the propet did thirdly and lastly wee learne here the different natures and properties of sinne and holinesse sinne euen the least sinne nay a very sinfulnes of nature makes a man afraid of god presence that sinne vnrepented of doth so appeares in adam who as in his integrity he spoke amp conuersed euen in a familiar sort with god so no sooner had he finned but he ranne from god and hid himselfe amp that euen the least sinnes not repented of doe so also appeares in this prophet who beeing a holy man yet his conscience being priuie to it self of some small omissions or negligeces in his calling he crieth out he is vndone because he seeth the lord of hosts but contrariwise the state of perfect holinesse amp the want of all sinne makes a man bold in god presence and rather desirous then afraid to behold god glory which shall bee most apparant at the last day for when the wicked shal desire rather to be couered with the hilles and ground to dust by the mountaines then to appeare before the face of god then shal the godly whose holinesse shal then bee perfect looke vp and lift vp their heads because their redemption is so nigh and iob testifieth of himselfe that hee knoweth his redeemer liueth and that hee shall stand before him amp looke vpon him with his eyes thus as guiltinesse driues a man from the kings presence but innocence makes him bold before him so sinfulnesse makes a man auoid god presence but holinesse makes him drawe neare vnto god and to reioyce in his presence then for a conclusion of this point let all man heare learne the way to true courage and boldnesse before god namely to repent dayly of their sinnes and labour to growe in true holinesse wealth nor wit learning nor authoritie can do this for thee but onely a good conscience which must bee made good by grace and by repentance then shalt thou reioice in god presece in this world and delight to thinke of god to speake of god to pray vnto him to meete him in his word and sacraments and at the last day shalt thou stand with confidence before the throne of his glory hitherto of the feare and astonishment of the prophet and of the causes thereof now followeth his consolation then flewe one of the seraphims ampc in these two verses is laid downe the second generall point namely the consolation of the prophet concerning which there are two points in the text the ground and matter of his consolation that is the forgiuenesse of his sinnes diverse circumstances of that consolation the time then the minister by whom it was done an angell one of the seraphims the manner how he did it speedily he flewe the instrument or outward signe a coale from the altar the outward action or application of it he touched his lippes the matter of the consolation is last in order let vs therefore first speake of the circumstances the first circumstance is the time when this prophet was comforted and raised fro his feare then saith the text that is after his feare and astonishment but not afore thus dealt god alwaies with all his saints he bestoweth no graces on the pertaining to saluation but after he hath by some meanes or other brought the to true humiliation in themselues and to sorrow for their sinnes humiliation is the preparatiue for grace for when by sight and sense of their sinnes and their owne misery by sinne he hath euen driuen them quite out of themselues finding nothing in themselues but cause of feare and astonishment then powres hee the oyle of grace and of sweete comfort into their hearts amp refresheth their weary soules with the deawe of his mercy this point needes no further proofe for looke into the scriptures amp we shal finde god neuer called any man to the state of grace or to any notable worke or function in his church but hee first humbled them and then brought them out of al conceit with themselues and then wrought in them and by them his wonderfull workes the vse of this doctrine is first of all to teach all man to esteeme aright of the afflictions that god layeth vpon them in this world commonly man take them impatiently amp our nature grudgrudgeth against them but let a christian man consider with himselfe how god hath alwaies dealt with his children and he hath cause not to thinke so for doth god lay some great affliction on thee it may be he hath some mighty worke of his grace to worke in thee or som great work of mercie to bewroght by thee in his church and hereby prepareth thee for the same say therefore with the holy prophet i helde my tongue lord and spake nothing because it was thy doing and what god may intend in his so doing to thee thou canst not tell and therefore in silence and patience possesse thy soule againe here is a comfort to all such as are distressed in mind in sense of their finnes and sight of god wrath their state is not miserable much lesse desperate for they are in the high way to grace and fauour god iustifieth not but him that repents god exalts not but him that is humbled god comforts not but him that is distressed god hath mercie on none but such as both knowne and feele they want it and knowe also that they knowe not where to haue it but at his hands happie therefore is that soule that feeles the waight and burden of sin for to him wil christ bring most ease and comfort god ministers therefore are hereby to comfort distressed consciences to assure them that if with this prophet they bee so deepely touched with sight of their sins and god iustice as that they cry woe is me i am vndone then eue then are they most capable of comfort and best prepared to receiue it as here it sell out to the holy prophet thirdly here is the way taught vs how to attaine to any excellet graces of god either for our own saluation or the good of the church namely to labour for a sencible feeling of the want of them in our selues for god vseth to bestowe no gifts on any man but such as do in humilitie amp low linesse confesse to god amp acknowledge in themselues the want of them so the blessed irgin singeth god filleth the hungry with good things but the rich hee sendes emptie away and so the psalmist god satisfieth the hungry soule and filleth the emptie soule with goodnesse so then if thou be rich in thy conceits god hath not for thee but if thou be hungry he is readie to fill thee with good things and dost thou acknowledge thy soule emptie then behold treasures of goodnesse to feede and fill thee and article thou cast downe with the prophet and is thy soule emptie of hope and fraught with feare then behold euen then god and his angels ready to raise thee vp amp to fill thee with consolation thus much for the time of his consolation the minister by whom was one of the seraphims the circumstance of his consolation is the minister by whom it was done an angel one of the seraphims that is an angell of that order so called out of which we learne first that there are diverse degrees and seuerall orders of angels though wee knowe not the true distinction thereof nor thinke it lawful to imagine them to be nor to set them down particularly as the church of rome doth who make many of their owne deuises which they cal traditios of equal authority with the scriptures secondly that these holy angels are the glorious guard of god and doe continually stand about the throne of his glory amp attend his holy wil both in heauen and in earth thirdly that they are also by the merciful appointment of god the guard of god children and ministring spirits sent out as it were with a commission for the good of the elect all these points because they are plaine in the scripture and do lesse cocerne our general scope which is touching the ministery i passe them ouer fourthly here it is apparat that as the anges are sent out for the helpe amp seruice of the elect so especially of god ministers as is plaine in this place where the prophet being afrighted a holy angel is ready to giue him comfort and so ouer the whole course of the prophets and at this day their protection and comfortable assistance is no lesse present to the godly ministers of the newe testament though not in such sensible signes and such visible manner as in the olde for if they bee ministring spirits sent out for the good of them which shall bee saued howe much more for their good which shall bee both saued themselues and saue others also a doctrine of great comfort and much good vse to all ministers who first of all may here learne contentment intheir calling for howsoeuer no calling hath more crosses so none againe hath more comfort and howsoeuer none bee more disgraced by euillmen yet none is more honoured by the holy angels and howsoeuer in this world they aboue any calling are seruats to all man yet none hath the seruice amp attendance of angels so much as they for though we haue them not to helpe vs to do the outward actions of our ministery with vs or for vs as some popish doctors teach that in their masse a man is not said to one collect because the angels say a man to it yet doubtlesse they are preset alwaies as at all holy exercises and lawful actions so especially at the publike seruice of god performed by the ministers and beside that they are witnesses thereto and of the paines and diligence and faithfulnesse of a good minister they also do minister vnto them oftentimes bodily strength and assistance amp many comforts in their troublesome trauels which they know not how by any naturall meanes they come vnto them and as this doctrine doth thus yeeld them contentment against the contempt so also courage against the danger of this calling for what though thou hast mightie man of this world against thee when thou hast angels for thee amp what though thou fightest against principality and powers when thou hast cherubins and seraphims on thy side godly ministers haue many enemy but if by the eye of faith they can see as well who are with them as with the eye of reason who are against them they will confesse with elisha there are more with vs then against vs the stories of all ages doe affirme and the cofortable experience of these daies of ours doth verifie the truth hereof ministers that liue in places very prophane or very popish it is admirable to see how many daungers they haue escaped and plottes they haue auoided which by their enemy or rather the enemy of their doctrine haue bone laide for their liues which their deliuerance and many other comforts in their ministries whence are they but from god protection by the ministry of his angels afore we leaue this point two questions may be asked not amisse briefely to be resolued first if any aske whence comes it that angels performe more seruice to good mlnisters then to other man i answere the reason is partly from god partly from the angels first god hath a principall care of them aboue other man because they worke his worke aboue all other callings for their labours immediately cocerne the good of mens soules whereas others do first concerne the body and consequently the soule therefore whereas he hath giuen his angels charge ouer all his elect to keepe them in all their good waies they haue a speciall charge doubtlesse ouer al godly and faithfull ministers whose waies are god in a speciall manner againe angels themselues as they willingly performe any seruice to the church or to any part thereof so most willingly of all are they imployed for the good of godly ministers and that for two causes first because they are their fellow labourers both for that y t angels amp good ministers are both called god embassadors amp god own servant or officers in a more peculiar manner then any other calling amp for that their seruice is so like that their names are common one to the other angels being called ministers and ministers angels as though they were almost all one secondly because the ministers dutie is to conuert amp saue soules being a worke which next to the glorifying of god and doings his wil the angels doe take most delight in aboue any other for if they be sent out for the good of them which shal be saued how much more willingly for their good by whom they are saued which shal be saued amp if the angels reioice at the couersion of a sinner surely they much loue him amp desire to doe him good by whom the sinner is conuerted and in these respects that angels and ministers haue the same names and are both imployed in the same great worke namely doing good to the elect therefore is it that the angel calles himselfe s john the euangelists fellow in the reuelation if then they be fellowes eue fellow servant amp fellow laborers in a more special maner then any other what maruel though the angels be most willingly imployed in doing any seruice of helpe or comfort to godly ministers in the second place if any aske if it be so then what duties are ministers to performe to angels for this their so carefull seruice amp especiall attendance vpon them aboue other man a papast would answere ministers must therefore worshippe them and keepe their fasting amp holy dayes and say their seruice and pray vnto them as to their keepers and mediators but alas cannot the kings messenger or officer be honoured vnlesse he be set vpon the kings throne will nothing serue him but the crowne and scepter so cannot angels be honoured vnlesse they be made god or sauiours or mediators but i answere therefore wee dare not go so farre least we remember the servant so much that we forget the master but rather we answere thus seeing angels are thus seruiceable to god ministers it should first of all teach al man to honour that calling with all due reuerence for they cannot but please the angels in honouring good ministers whom they esteeme their fellowes secondly it should teach all ministers not to content themselues with the name and title but to labour to bee good and faithfull for so doing they are fellowes to the angels and it is a disgrace to the angels when those that are their fellowes are vnfaithfull and it should further teach them to adorne their calling with a holy life for as sinne is that that grieues the angels amp driues them away so it is grace and holinesse which makes them delight in the fellowship of man and it may also encourage any man to take paines in that holy calling wherein hee is sure to haue god angels in a speciall manner to attende him to assist him to protect him and to bee a witnesse of his faithfulnesse and who would not worke cheerefully in that labour wherein hee hath the angels to bee in a sort fellow workers with him to doe these three duties is to honour good angels and that minister that conscionably performeth them the angels will take themselues sufficiently honoured of that man and if beside this honour we would reioyce god angels and minister matter of ioy vnto them then in the fourth place let all ministers propounde to themselues aboue al things the conversion of soules rather then their own praise or liuing or pleasing of man and so endeuour it both in teaching and all their other courses that the angels may see it and bee witnesse of it for if they reioyce at the conversion of a sinner as christ saith they doe then those man make them oftest reioyce which doe most seriously aime at the conversion of sinners and thus we see both the seruice of angels to god ministers and the duties they are to performe to them in that regard the due consideration of this point may raise the world to a better conceit of this calling and perswade fathers to dedicate their sonnes to it and stirre vp young students to consecrate themseluest hereto amp turne their studies to that ende for no man in no calling hath so speciall attendance and assistance of god angels as godly ministers haue at least if it worke not this in the world yet it may yeeld comfort amp contentment to all faithfull ministers in their painfull calling but let vs see how the angel performed his seruice to the prophet not vnwillingly not lingeringly but speedily so saith the text he flewe which is not so to bee vnderstood as though the angels had wings for they haue no corporall nor sensible bodyes but spirituall and insensible substances the actions whereof are performed with such nimblenesse and agilitie as can not fall within the compasse of outward sense but the phrase is vsed for our capacities to shew how readily and speedily the angel went about to minister comfort to the prophet for as nothing moueth so quickly to our sense as doth the creature that flyeth and as wee say that man doth flye about his businesse which doth it quickly and diligently so here the holy ghost sets downe the willingnesse and quicknesse of the angel to comfort this holy prophet and to doe the will of god where we learne first what excellent servant of god the holy angels bee which so readily willingly and speedily execute the will of their lord this must teach all god servant to doe the like and to imitate the in this excellent obedience and the rather because wee pray dayly to god thy will be done in earth as it is in heauen in earth of vs as it is in heauen of the holy angels but they doe it most cheerfully and without all lingring therefore so ought we magistrates in their places and ministers in theirs and euery man in his function is to apply this to himselfe and to bee stirred vp thereby to a cheerfulnesse amp quicknesse in their duties for therein they resemble the blessed angels amp then their deodes accord wity their prayer but contrariwise he that doth his dutie vnwillingly and vnreadly is like the diuel which indeed doth god will amp yet against his will and surely vnto such obedience there belongeth no reward but as god loueth a cheerfull giuer so doubtlesse loues hee a cheerfull worker secondly we see here how great loue angels beare vnto god children especially vnto godly ministers how willingly they are imployed to doe them good willingnesse and readines to doe good to any man must needes come from loue and yet alas all man euen the best and all ministers euen the best are creatures farre inferior to the angels here magistrates amp ministers must learne to be farre from contempt of their inferiours and to doe their duties of ruling and teaching carefully though the people bee farre their infriors it is the nature of loue to make any man doe seruice most willingly to him that hee loues though he be farre meaner then himselfe if therefore princes loue their subiects they will not spare any care cost nor paines nay they will reioyce to doe them good and they will labour to bee like the angels who are farre greater then man as they are then their subiects and if ministers loue their people they will forget their owne dignitie which oft times they might stand vpon and will make themselues euen servant to all that they may winne some and seeing angels doe flie so fast to giue helpe and comfort to good ministers this must teach them further first euery one to labour to bee a good minister for then are they sure of the loue of angels and then most willingly doe the angels any seruice to them againe let it teach them to flye as fast to the discharge of their duties to god church as the angels flye to doe them seruice so shal god angels thinke their diligence and carefull seruice well bestowed vpon them lastly this diligence of the angels amp their willingnesse proceeding from loue must stirre vp al christians to performe all duties of godlinesse to god amp of loue vnto his church with alacritie and cheerfulnesse so doe god angels we looke to be like the angels in glory in the world to come then bee like the angels in diligence loue and faithfulnes in this world the wise man saith hee that is slothfull in his businesse is good for nothing but the diligent man shall stand before the king and surely hee that is willing amp diligent in the duties of christianitie shall stand before the king of kings in heauen and let this suffice for the angels seruice and his diligence in his seruice now let vs see what instrument the angel vsed a coale from the altar the fourth circumstance of this consolation is the instrument which it pleased god the angel should vse to minister comfort to the prophet a strange instrument for so great a work a coale of fire here let humane reason hide it selfe and wordly wisedome bee confounded to see the wonderfull works of the lord god could haue healed the prophets infirmities and giuen him comfort against his feare amp courage in his calling without meanes but hee will vse meanes and what a weake meanes nay a meanes that seemes contrary a coale of fire must touch his lippes that which in all reason would haue made him speake worse by god appointment and the power of his word shall make him speake better out of which practise of god we learn many points first see how god magnifieth meanes hee can worke without them and so hee did in the creation giuing light to the worlde diverse dayes before there was sun but since the order of nature was established hee generally vseth meanes not onely in his ordinary but euen in his miraculous actions and though he vse not alwayes the ordinary and direct meanes yet meanes he generally vseth though they seeme contrary as heere in this place and the same wil be found true in almost al the miracles both of the old and new testament this therefore commends vnto all man the vse of such good meanes as god prouidence hath ordained of any duties or effecting of any thing that doth belong vnto vs to doe and not to depend vpon immediate helpes from heauen as many fonde and fantasticall man doe who are therfore oftentimes iustly forsaken of god and left destitute of all helpe and so exposed to shame and reproach secondly see here the mighty power of god ordinance how it appeareth in weakenesse such are all his great workes in the creation hee brought light out of darknesse in our redemption hee brought vs life out of death in our conuersions he workes vpon vs by his word amp by it hee drawes vs to him which in al reason would driue vs from him and by it confounds the wisedome of the worlde which is starke foolishnesse to the wisedome of the world and so here hee cleanseth the prophet by a coale of fire which would rather defile him and seasoneth his mouth with it which in reason should haue burned him so great so admirable and so powerfull are the ordinances of god though they seeme so contrary or so weake in themselues or in their meanes let this teach all man not to contemne the sacraments though the outward elements bread wine and water be weake and common and dead creatures in themselues nor the ministerie of the word though it be exercised by a weake man mortall amp miserable as others are for that god which can season the prophets mouth and clense his heart by a coale of fire no maruell though hee worke vppon the consciences of man by his word and sacraments and againe when we see grace and holinesse conueyed into mens hearts by the word and sacraments let vs learne not to ascribe it to the dignitie either of the minister or the elements but to the supreme power of the mightie god who can purge the prophet by a coale from the altar neither is it altogether without mysterie that god here sanctifieth the prophet by touching his lippes with a fierie coale for it signifieth that the apt amp sufficient teacher must haue a fierie tongue and to that same purpose the holy ghost came downe vppon the apostles in fierie toongs amp it may be that the one is a tipe of the other certaine it is that they both teach vs thus much that all true and able ministers must pray and endeuour to haue a tongue full of power and force euen like fire to eate vp the sinnes and corruptions of the worlde for though it be a worthy gift of god to speake mildly and moderately so that his speech shal fall like deawe vpon the grasse yet it is the firerie tongue that beates downe sinne and workes sound grace in the heart it may be there are some which neede the fierie tongue this shewes apparantly that those ministers neuer had their lips touched with a coale fro god altar that is their soules with a coale from god altar that is their consciences neuer touched nor their soules seasoned with the sanctifying grace of god spirit which sit still and see great and grieuous staines in a church and corruptions in a state and can bee content neuer to reproue them as though ministers were perswaders onely and not reprouers but when this comes to be wayed in the ballance of a good conscience it will bee found that not the pleasing tongue but the fierie tongue is the principall grace of a good minister but to goe further whence came this coale taken from the altar this coale of fire was taken by the angel from the altar of god where was a fire which neuer went out and this fire was that that came from heauen sent downe by god at the dedication of the temple by salomon and this fire kindled by god neuer went out for no man could kindle the like but all other was counted strange fire as nadab and abihu tryed in wofull experience when they would needes offer with in now the prophet must be cleansed with the fire which came from heauen teaching vs that the minister must haue his fierie tongue fro the holy ghost as the apostles were said to bee baptized with the holy ghost and with fire a fierie tongue is a speciall ornament of a minister but that fire must come from heauen that is his zeale must be a godly and heauenly zeale but hee that hath a rayling lying a slanderous a malicious or a contentious tongue hee hath a fierie tongue indeed but this is kindled of the sire of hell as s iames saith the vnbridled tongue is a world of wickednes and defileth the whole body setteth on fire the whole course of nature and is set on fire in hell so then a spitefull and malicious tongue wee see is a fierie tongue but that fire is taken from hell and not from god altar and hee that stands vp to preach with this tongue god will neuer suffer any great worke to be done by him in his church though his tongue be neuer so fierie and his speech neuer so powerfull as therefore ministers must abhorre the flattering and pleasing tongue and must haue a fierie tongue so on the other side this fire must bee from god altar that is the fire of their zeale must bee kindled by god spirit and not by the spirit of discord and dissention ambitious humors turbulent amp proud humour new opinions priuate quarrels all these nor none of these are for the pulpit these may make a man fierie tongued but this fire was neuer taken from god altar as the prophets was this fierie tongue neuer came from heauen as the apostles did it followeth and touched my lippes this fifth and last circumstance is the application of the remedie the coale which is the medicine is applyed by this angel to his lips that is to that part which was polluted and as he formerly complained of the pollution of his lips so the medicine is applyed to his lippes here the angell which in this case is made god minister doth teach all god ministers a great point of wisedome in heauenly diuinitie namely to apply their doctrine to their audience in such manner as the circumstances of place times or persons do require some ministers come to an ignorant and vnhumbled people and teach them the gospell which neuer knewe the lawe here the firy coale is vsed but the lips are not touched that is good doctrine taught but not well applyed for that the lawe should first be laid to their consciences others beate all vpon the lawe when it may be their hearers are a people sufficiently cast downe and haue more need to be raised vp with the sweet comforts of the gospell others vse to laye open the nakednes of the court in the country and to reproue the faults of princes and great magistrates before the comon people who haue more need of the catechisme others bring the catechisme or points of ordinarie instruction into the court where the duties of kings and councellors should be taught in all plainnesse and sinceritie others bring their new opinions or controuersall points vnto popular audiences which indeede are fit for the schools other busie themselues about ceremonies when the substance is in daunger to be lost all these haue it may be the coale of fire but it is misapplyed and not applyed to the polluted lips let all ministers therefore learne this point of wisdome of the angell to apply the medicines of their doctrine to the times persons and places which are infected so shal they be sure not to take paines in vaine and thus much of the circumstances of his consolation it followeth in the text loe thy iniquitie shall be taken away and thy sinnes shall be purged after the circumstances followeth the ground and matter of his consolation and that is the forgiuenesse of his sinnes where first let vs marke how it and the instrument are annexed together loe saith the angel this coale ha h touched tay lippes and thy iniquities shall bee forgiuen and thy sinnes purged as though hee had bene clensed by the coale where we may note how greatly god magnifieth the meanes which himself ordaineth euen true remission and saluation to the right and holy vsing of them though it come not from them but from his own mercy and power of his ordinance it is therefore no maruell though god sanctifieth the childe by the ministery of water in baptisme and feede our soules in the lord supper by feeding our body with bread and wine and no maruell though the carelesse neglect of either of them be damnation to him that despiseth them seeing they are god instruments ordained by him to conuey his grace vnto vs and yet for all this wee are to knowe that remission or saluation is no more tyed to the very elements or the actions then here the prophets forgiuenesse is to the coale of fire but the maine point is that for the prophets consolation the angell tells him his iniquities shall bee taken away and his sinnes purged as thereby he had said thy sins were the cause of thy feare therefore that thy feare may be taken away thy sinnes shall be forgiuen where we learne that as few comes by sinne so all true comfort comes from the forgiuenesse of sinnes this is that that onely pacifieth the conscience and satisfieth the soule when dauid had sinned against the lord in his two great sinnes and thereby prouoked god wrath against him and wounded his owne conscience if the prophet had told him hee had made him king of kingdomes more he had not so reioyced his heart as when he told him after his repentance thy sinnes are forgiuen thee thou shalt not dye so when this prophet was extreamely affrighted at god presece because of some sinnes and negligences in his calling it had bene no comfort to his poore soule to haue bene told thou shalt haue a more eloquent tongue and a more powerful speech thou shalt haue better accesse to the court amp audience before the king all these and all such like would haue beene no better then guided poyson vnto him being in this case but the happy answere that refresheth his wearie soule more then all the world was this loe thy iniquities are forgiuen and thy sinnes purged all faithfull ministers must heere learne the true way of comforting troubled and distressed conscieces namely first to drawe him vnto a sight of some particular sinnes then to summon him into god presence and there to arraigne him for those sinnes vntill the view of the foulnesse of his sinnes and the glory of god iustice haue sufficiently humbled him and then to labour to perswade his conscience vppon good groundes of the pardon of those sinnes by christ iesus this is the way that god vsed and deuised this is the sure way that cannot faile some thinke that all trouble of mind is nothing but melancholy and therefore thinke nothing needes but physicke and outward comforts but he that considers in what case the prophet heere was or dauid when hee made the the or the psalmes will be of another mind and will finde that nothing can properly trouble the mind but sinne therefore as the wise physitian in his cure first searcheth out the cause and then endeuours to take it away so the good physitian of the soule must first of all search into the cause of his sicknesse that is his sins and must take them away which if they doe not then al their labour is lost for al the company musicke recreation wine diet nay all worldly comforts amp delights if it were the advancement to a kingdom cannot so much comfort the distressed soule of a sinner as this voice of a minister spoken from god vpon good grounds thy sinnes are forgiuen thee now to lay downe what bee those true and good groundes whereupon a minister may safely and comfortably pronounce pardon of sins to a sinner belongs properly to another place in the next place let vs heere obserue how the lord afore he renued the prophets commission or send him to preach to the people first humbles him for his sinnes and then vppon his repentance giues him pardon teaching vs that no minister is well qualified to the holy duties of the ministerie vnlesse hee haue truly repented of his sins and haue obtained pardon and mercie in the messias ministers labour for qualifications but the true minister of god will labour for this qualification aboue all other for doubtlesse hee shall pronounce most powerfully the pardon of sinnes to others to whose conscience god hath pronounced pardon of his owne in the last place let vs obserue how the prophet being to be comforted before hee goe this newe embassy the lord is so carefull for him that rather then he be not comforted if there be no man to do it an angel shal be set to be his comforter amp if ther be not another prophet to doe it an angell shall pronounce vnto him the pardon of his sins let this be an encouragement for all pastors and ministers of god church to labour painfully amp faithfully in their places for the goodnesse of the lord will neuer faile them nor shall they want comfort when euer they stand in neede thereof yes rather shall angels from heauen be their helpes and comforters then faithfull ministers shall be left destitute hitherto of the second generall points namely of the prophets consolation the third and last generall point is the renouatiou of the prophets commission in the eight amp part of the ninth verses and it containeth parts a question or inquirie made by god when shall i send and who shall goe for vs the answere of the prophet here am i send me the commission renued vnto him the lord said goe and speake vnto this people the first part is a question made by god by way of proclamation wherein he enquireth who shall goe preach vnto this people also i heard the voice of the lord saying whom shall i send and who shall gae for vs in which proclamation and inquirie of the lord we are not to imagine that the lord was either vnprouided of such as should execute his will or knewe not who were able or who were willing to goe preach his word for as the apostle saith in the matter of election the lord knoweth whr are his so much more in particular vocations the lord knoweth who are his and neede not to aske whom shall i send or who shall goe but then it may be demanded why the lorde saith so i answere not for his owne sake but for ours whom hereby he would instruct in diverse points of holy doctrine first hereby he would giue vs to vnderstand how hard a thing it is to finde an able and godly minister for if there were not a great scarcity of such man the lorde needed not aske this question but some will obiect against this that there are in many christian churches so many ministers as they cannot all bee maintained but some goe vp and downe vndisposed and vnprouided for i answere this is too true in all ages there were wandering leuits in the olde testament which went vp and downe and offered their seruice and serued for shekels of siluer and a sute of apparell and meate and drinke but this calamitie was vpon the church of the iewes neuer but then when there was no king in israel and euery one did that which was good in his owne eyes if therefore there bee any in our church and in christian nation which goe vp and downe and offer their seruice at such rates it is much more miserable seeing now there are kings in israel and therefore it is no reason that euerie man rob the church as it shal please his couetous minde but ceasing to enquire whether this be so or no and if it bee so leauing the reformation thereof to those churches and states whom it may concerne i answere for the matter in hand that this may be so and yet the lorde may complaine as heere hee doth whom shall i send for the lord meane h not such as beare the name of leuits or priestes in the olde or of ministers in the new testament for there were alwaies inow of them who some for preferment sake some for their ease and some for a refuge how to liue are willing to enter that function and accordingly in that calling seee not the lord but themselues and their owne ends but heere the lorde enquireth for such man as first purely doe seeke and vndertake that function therein to honour god and to gather his church and then in all their labours and ministeriall duties truly and faithfully endeuour to the same ends preaching god word and as god word diligently reprouing exhorting and admonishing and shining before their people in good workes for such man it is no maruell though the lorde light a candle at no one day and make open proclamation to seeke for them saying whom shall i send for such a man is as iob saith one of a thousand for some wat ability to discharge their duties as s paul saith who are sufficient for those things and some want willingnesse to vndertake the labour as god here complaineth who shall goe for vs now to make vse of this doctrine to our church it were to be wished that in these daies amp for our christian churches the lord had not as great cause to cry out in the want of able faithfull and godly ministers whom shall i send and who shall goe for vs but alas this want is too apparant and this blemish is too notorious and it is a worke worthy the labour of kings and princes to reforme it and is a kings evil not to be healed but by the power of a king for as long as there are so fewe and meane preferments for painefull ministers there will neuer want abundance of such ministers as doe want either conscience or abilitie to discharge their duties in the meane time till god put into the hearts of parliaments and princes to locke to this great and needfull worke let vs ministers learne our duties and first wee who are in the vniuersities are here admonished to look to our selues by god blessing we are many and daily growe more and more let vs therefore so furnish our selues as that when god or his church shall say who shall goe for vs and whom shall i send then he may find many amongst vs who he may send to that great worke of the minisierie amp let vs feare to be such as thar god may affirme of vs as in the daies of iob that he cannot finde one of a thousand secondly all ministers learne here not to content themselues with the name and title of ministers but labour for the substantiall ornaments thereof nor to be willing to take the honour and liuings and to refuse the burden and duties of the ministerie for else let them knowe god hath no neede of them for had the lorde pleased or contented himself with such kinde of man as seeke to bee ministers for themselues and not for his sake or beeing ministers doe feede themselues and not their flocke or preach themselues and not christ then had he not needed to haue made this proclamation for ages haue yeelded store of such but contrariwise hee that is painfull and faithfull in this function let him knowe that god and his church hath neede of him lastly heere the roman cleargie are iustly to bee taxed whose number is infinite but it is lamentable to see howe fewe among them be such as the lord heere seeketh for their orders of regulars are exceeding many beside all their secular priests and it is almost incredible how many thousands there bee of dominicans or franciscans or in some one of their orders and yet amongst the many millions of their monkes there is scarce to bee found one of many who for his learning amp other gifts is fit to be sent to the worke of god nay their ignorance was palpable and ridiculous to the world vntill of late being by luther and others of our church made ashamed thereof they haue laboured especially the jesuit to become learned how foule a thing is it that amongst so many the lord should haue cause to complaine whom shall wee send the iesuits indeed many of them are learned but for other qualities they are fitter to be plotters amp practisers in statematters spies or intelligencers reconcilers seducers and subuerters then ministers and fitter to be instruments of pollicie to evil kings then ministers of the gospel vnto god but take away them and some fewe selected monkes and those but fewe out of many thousands amp then euen for learning also god may cry and call amp proclaime in their monasteries whom shal i send and if it be a shame and miserie to a church to want such as god may send or to haue but a fewe then the roman church is shamelesse which shames not to haue so many and yet amongst them all whom god may send almost none in the next place by this inquirie and question made by god whom shall i send and who shall goe for vs the lord would teach vs that no man is to vndertake this function vnlesse god call and send him therefore heere are condemned the prophane fancies of the anabaptists and all like them who thinke that any man vppon a priuate motion may steppe foorth and vndertake the duties of a prophet to preach and expound ampc oh but say they these motions are from god spirit surely they can say litle for themselues who cannot say so much but that cannot serue their turne for if we say contrariwise nay but they are from the diuel or at the least from your owne vanitie and pride how can they disproue it againe might not the prophet haue alledged that with a better pretence and colour then they yet he stayeth till god heere call him euen so all good ministers are to stay god calling if any aske how he shal know when god calles him i answere god calleth ordinarily by his church her voyce is his therefore whensoeuer the church of god saith vnto thee thou shalt bee sent and ou shalt goe for vs euen then doth the lorde call vs out to this holy function thirdly let vs obserue how the lord saith who shal i send amp who shal goe for vs some interpreters gather out of this chapter an argument for the trinitie of persons as namely out of the verse where the angels sing holy holy holy lord god ampc but it is not sound enough to ouerthrowe our stubborne enemy the iewes and therfore it seemes those diuines are of a sounder and wiser iudgement who seeing we haue other places pregnant and plaine enough therefore thinke it no good discretio to vrge this or any such place which may probably admit another interpretation least that the iewes finding the weaknes of the argument doe iudge al our proofes to be as weak and so take occasion to persist the rather in their blindnesse by that which wee brought to haue conuerted them and as for that song of the angels in the third verse where they ascribe holinesse to the lord times that thei repetition signifieth nothing else but the continuall ioy and delight which the holy angels take in praising of god who cannot satisfie theselues in honouring his name teaching vs in their example neuer to bee weary of praysing god by prayers and holy hymnes and of honouring him in our liues and callings but to proue out of the words holy holy holy the three persons in trinitie seemes to bee no fit nor sound collection rather in my opinion wee may safely collect and conclude out of these wordes i and vs that there are more persons in the trinitie then one for first god the father or the whole deitie saith whom shall i send and then changing the number hee saith who shall goe for v for howsoeuer god may imploy in the word vs that he that is sent to preach is sent as well for the good of the church as for his owne glory yet can it not bee denyed but that the plurall number heere and else where ascribed to the deitie must needs argue a certaine pluralitie of persons in that deitie as in genesis it is written that god said let vs make man and here who shall goe for vs out of the euidence of which places seeing the enemy of this doctrine must needes grant a pluralitie namely that there are more then one then wee shal sufficiently proue out of other places and by other argnments that there are three in the last place let vs marke what god saith whom shall i send amp who shal goe for vs god sends a minister to preach and he goeth for god then behold here what is the trade and profession of a minister hee is the seruaunt of god so saith god here he goeth for me and so saith the apostle of himself amp al other good ministers that they are god labourers and in another place the angel of god appeared whose i am and whom i serue but if any man thinke that either god speaketh too fauourably of them or s paul too partially of themselues then let the diuell himselfe bee iudge in this case who plainly amp freely confesseth though he did it not in loue to the truth or them these man are the servant of the most high god which teach vnto vs the way of saluation let therefore either god be beleeued who is for them or the diuell who is against them but what kinde of seruantes are they what place or office haue they they are his messengers or ambassadors this is their profession and their place now then for the vse hereof if they be god servant then are they not their owne maisters they haue a maister euen god whose they are and for whom and from whom they come they may not therefore please theselues nor serue their own pleasures nor seeke the satisfying of their owne carnall lustes either in matter of pleasure credite or profite if they doe then wil he call the to a heauie account whose servant they are againe if they bee god servant then let them doe their seruice to god and expect their reward from god some ministers wil expect the reward and honour of god servant but will doe no seruice that beseemes not servant let such man remember for whom they come euen from that god who as he can giue reward so hee will expect seruice and as for such man as painfully do their seruice but are not regarded nor rewarded of man as they deserue let them bee content amp continue in their faithfulnesse for they are god embassadors amp we know embassadors may haue gifts giuen them of those to whom they are sent but they expect their maintenance from the kings their owne maisters so the maintenance which the world should giue ministers is like gifts giuen to embassadors if it come it is no more then they deserue if it come not yet will faithfull ministers doe their dutie and expect their payment from their king and maister god whose they are and whom they serue thirdly if they bee god embassadors sent by him and come from and for him then let all such as either condemne or any way iniury them bee assured that as god is mighty amp powerfull so he will mightily reuenge it there was neuer king so poore or weake but thought himselfe strong inough to reuenge any wrong offered to his embassador and shall god suffer so foule a wickednesse to lye vnpunished nay they and their posterities shall smart for it let ahab and iezabel and iulian say it be not so and all ages or stories shew the cotrary if they can that euer any contemner and abuser of godly ministers escaped the visible vengeance of god reuenging hands on him or his fourthly seeing they are god messengers amp servant they must not be the servant of man to please or flat or satisfie humour this is not for them that are god servant they therefore that will bee slaues to the persons and pleasures and humour of man they forget that they are god servant and came for him yes they must not endeuour the pleasing of themselues nor the bringing of their owne purposes to passe but in euery motion either made to them by others or suggested from their owne hearts they must forth with call to minde who sent me hither amp for whom am i come euen from amp for god therefore they are to yeeld to nothing nor ayme at any thing but which may be both to the will and for the glory of him that sent them and if the great man of this world doe thinke it wrong that any man should command their servant against their will or expect any seruice from them against their owne honour then let them thinke it reason that god ministers should not bee commanded any thing contrary to god will or against his honour and further if ministers bee god servant then let them regard their maisters glorie and be ashamed to doe any thing either in their doctrine or liues which may dishonour him that servant is vnworthy of a good maister who seekes not his maisters credite in all his courses lastly if they be god embassadors then must they not deliuer their owne fancies or inuentions but that message they receiued and as they receiued it so must they deliuer it and if they do their duties faithfully this doctrine is comfortable to them they may take paines with ioy they haue a maister wil reward them they may speake freely so it be with discretion they haue a master will make it good they may stand boldly in the face of their enemy they haue a maister wil defend them and euery faithfull minister may say to himselfe i will doe my dutie and deliuer my embassy he whom i serue and whose i am he who sent me and for whom i come will beare me out and thus much of the inquirie which god makes and the manner of it now let vs see the answere which the prophet makes in these words then i said here am i send me the prophet after hee was comforted by god and had his sinnes forgiuen then answereth heere am i send me first marke heere what a great change is wrought on the suddaine he who a little afore feared and shrunke at the least appearance of god glorie now stands forth boldly as soone as he is called and answereth heere am i send me so great a matter is it for a minister to haue his sinnes forgiuen and to feele the fauour of god to his soule and conscience here therefore wee haue an answere to two great questions often mooued in the worlde first many would haue quietnesse of minde and peace of conscience and cannot attaine vnto it if they aske how they might to them i answere here is the way seeke it not in wordly wealth carnal pleasures nor humane learning in company nor recreations but seeke it in the fauour of god and pardon of thy sinnes and thou shalt not misse of it thus shalt thou haue comfort in thy owne conscience courage before man and boldnesse toward god secondly many students in diuinitie would gladly be ministers and doe much honour to the calling but they finde a feare and shrinking in themselues and thereby an vnwillingnesse to venter vpon it if they aske how they may amend this i answere or rather the example of his prophet answereth for me let that man set himselfe in god presence enter into himselfe search his conscience finde out his sins confesse and bewaile them to god craue pardon in christes blood amp grace to leaue them amp cease not till he heare the voyce of god spirit sounding in his conscience thy sinnes are forgiuen thee then when god shal aske whom shall i send thou wilt answere readily and with ioy heere am i send me and againe many are driuen from this calling to beholde the contempt and reproach and daungers which belong vnto it but let those man marke heere the phrase of this holy prophet when god asked whom shall i send hee might haue answered lorde i would goe but such disgraces and discouragements doe accompanie this function as i desire to bee excused but hee casting aside all such conceits answereth peremptorily here am i send mee how came this to passe for certainly the prophet was as sensible of these wrongs as any of vs all for he was nobly borne and brought vp amp was of the blood royal surely because he saw he was in god fauour he had him and his commission on his side amp he held this for a sure ground if god bee on my side who can be against me therefore doubtlesse those man who are driuen backe by these discouragements were neuer setled in assurance that their sinnes were forgiuen nor satisfied sufficiently that god is on the side of all good ministers and that their calling as it hath his authoritie from god so likewise allowance blessing assisstance and defence of god aboue any other calling for if they were they would scorne the scorne and contemne the contempt of the prophane world and with much courage and comfort set their hand to god plough and say with the prophet here i am send me secondly let vs obserue how the prophet when god askes the question sends him not to others nor commends others to that seruice as is to be thought hee might haue done many in the churches of the iewes but offers himselfe here am i it controlles the carnall courses of many amongst vs in the niuersities who thinke it sufficient to liue there and send out other man and giue testimonies and letters of commendations to other man but themselues stirre not when question is made who shall goe to such a place or who shall be sent to such a parish they say not here am i but either it is too little a liuing or too great a charge or ill seated or some fault it hath that they will not be sent to it but will answere god and his church there is such a man and giue him letters of testimonie or commendation and so all is well but for themslues they liue too sweete and easie liues willingly to vndertake the contempt and burthen of the ministerie let such man therefore learne when god amp his church giue them a calling to answere with the prophet here am i send me and let all such as are students of diuinitie in the vniuersities marke here the prophets answere not i will bee ready but here i am why takes hee no longer time because hee was now sufficiently qualified where let them learne not to linger and lye rotting too long in their specidatiue courses but when they are competently furnished with learning and other qualities befitting that calling let them shew themselues willing and ready to yeeld their seruice to the church when they shall be called for as an apple may as well hang too long on the tree as bee puld too soone and both make it vnfit for vse so many man as well stay too long as goe out too soone and both wayes are made vnprofitable or at least lesse profitable in the church and to conclude this second point it is not vnworthy to be noted that the prophet saith not here i am and i runne on my owne head but send me hee willes the lord to send him then where are they who dare bragge of their priuate motions and will runne when they are not sent the prophet might haue said oh now i feele a motion from the spirit therefore i will goe and preach but he stayeth til he be sent in expresse termes let no man therfore presume to presse into this function till hee bee fully resolued in his conscience that god and his church hath said vnto him goe and though a man be neuer so well qualified with all maner of sufficiency yet let him sit still and stay god leisure and let him say heere i am send me and so rest contented vntill hee bee sent if any man say it is vnfit that a man should say so of himselfe i answere let him not say so in words but in deeds let him therfore make proofe of himselfe and giue the church tryall of his gifts vpon which experience of his gifts if he be found sufficient that practise of his is all one and much more then if hee had saide here i am send me thus wee see the prophet would not stirre til he were sent and therefore in the next word he is bid to goe and he said goe and speake vnto this people here is the third and last point namely the essentiall words of his commission wherin after god had sought for one to goe and the prophet had presented himselfe and offered his seruice god both giues him leaue to goe and further doth furnish him with authoritie both to goe and speake wherein the principall point is that the authoritie of the prophets calling is from god him else in plaine and e ide at words goe and speake and till then the prophet went not so in the new testament the apostles went not into the world to preach till they had their commission goe and teach all nation and after them saint paul hot till it was said vnto him ar se and goe in all which is discouered and condemned the pride and presumption of those who dare run on their own heads and will not stay till the lord say vnto them goe and speake these man are bolder then either the extraordinarie prophets of the olde testament or the apostles which are the extraordinary ministers of the new who alwaies had their warrant with the when they went and if any man aske why is it necessarie they should haue so i answere the reasons are many first all prophets and ministers are god deputies and commissioners it is therfore reason that they haue authoritie from their lord and maister secondly their wordes nor deedes beare no credit nor haue any power in them vnlesse they be spoken by vertue of a commission nor haue their labours any blessing vnlesse god giue it thirdly these persons haue no protection nor safetie vnlesse they bee god embassadors and how are they so vnlesse they be called and sent by god and haue authoritie giuen of god for these causes no man is to thrust himselfe into the ministerie without a calling from god and therefore no maruell though those man who will bee chusers and callers of themselues and run when they are not sent bee in their persons subiect to all daungers because they are out of god protection amp their labours without profit because no blessing nor promise of god was giue vnto them for god may iustly say vnto them let him that sent you protect your persons let him that sent you blesse your labours but it will then be demaunded how may i know if god bid me goe for god speakes not now from heauen as in old time and as to this prophet i answere it is true we are to looke for no such visiions nor apparitions from heauen for ordinarily there are none such and the popish church doth but deceiue themselues and cozen the world who tell vs of so many apparitions that happen to their monkes and fryers for now ordinarily god speaketh in another maner to his church for in generall duties god speaketh to vs out of his word and holy scriptures and in particular and personall duties where the word in plaine termes serueth not hee speaketh to a man by his owne conscience and by the voice of his church out of his word god sheweth thee the dignitie and excellencie of this calling to be a minister of the word namely they are his messengers and embassadors ampc that so hee may winne them to loue and affect it and againe the necessicitie of it that it teacheth the way to saluation that without it ordinarily god church is not gathered nor mens soules saued that this may stirre thee vp to vndertake the burthen this is generall but now particularly for thy selfe wouldest thou knowe whether god would haue thee to goe or no then thou must aske thy owne conscience and aske the church for if thou be hartily willing and be fully and worthity qualified then god bids thee goe now thy conscience must iudge of thy willingnesse and the church of thy abilitie and as thou mai not trust other man to iudge of thy inclination or affection so thou maist not trust thy owne iudgement to iudge of thy worthines or sufficience if therefore thy owne conscience tell thee vpon true examination that thou doest not loue and affect this calling aboue any other then god sends thee not and if thou enter with such a testimonie not god but some worldly and sinister respect doth send thee and put thee forward for though thou doest desire it yet if the church of god giue not allowance of thy sufficiecie god doth not send thee but if contrariwise thy conscience doe truly testifie vnto thee that thou desirest to doe seruice to god and his church in this calling aboue any other and if withal vpon signification hereof to the church and vpon trial made of thy gifts and learning the church that is maly learned wise and godly and such as the church hath publikely appointed for that purpose doe approue of that thy desire and of thy sufficiencie to doe god seruice in his ministerie and thereupon by a publike calling bid thee goe then assuredly god himselfe hath bid thee goe and it is as effectuall a calling as if thou heardst the voice of god fro heauen for as in repentance if thy conscience tell thee thou hast truly repented and if thou canst make that knowne to the church by so good euidece as thervpon a minister of god pronounceth the pardon of thy sins vnto thee if thou rest herein and knowest it to be as effectuall as if god from heauen had told thee thy sinnes are pardoned so is it here if thou hast the testimonie first of thy conscience and then of the church thou article to rest therein as in the voice of god and this is the calling that wee are to looke for in these dayes by which doctrine as those are iustly condemned of foule presumption who dare runne vppon priuate motions and carnall respects and are iustly left without blessing or protection so they on the other side doe offer great wrong to god and to his church who when they cannot denie but they affest the ministerie aboue any calling and haue approbation of their giftes from the church of god yet will not beleeue the testimonie of the church herein but their own priuate iudgemets which in this case is no way a competent iudge either for or against let such man knowe that they oppose themselues euen against god himselfe it being certaine that where the inward calling of the conscience and the outward calling of the church doe concurre there god himselse calleth and biddeth that man goe and speake now then to drawe to an ende let vs obserue in the last place with what authoritie a minister of god comes vnto vs and executes his function euen with an immediate authoritie amp commission from god whereby he is bid goe and speake if it bee so let it perswade the world to feare to doe any wrong either to that calling or to those persons who come with so faire a commission from from god himselfe but if it doe not perswade the prophane worlde at least let this be a comfort amp encouragement to all true ministers for if god bid them goe he will goe with them himselfe if hee send them hee will not forsake them but assist them and blesse them and open their mouthes and enlarge their hearts and harden their foreheads and giue power vnto their words to conuer this children amp to confound and astonish the hearts of his enemy if he send them he will defend and protect them so that one haire of their heades shall not fall to the earth without his prouidence if hee send them hee will prouide for them and sufficiently reward them and will honour them in the hearts of his owne people and magnifie them in the faces of their enemy and lastly if hee send them he will pay them their wages euen an eternal waight of comfort here and of glorie in heauen and as they are here bid goe so once they shul be bid come and that not onely with the generall call of all the elect come ye blessed of my father inherite the kingdome prepared for you but euen with that particular call which especially belongs to them that are faithfull in this seruice come thou good and faithful servant enter into thy maisters ioy blessed be he that commeth in the name of the lord w p they that turne many to righteousnesse shall shine as the starres for euer and euer w c let a man so thinke of vs as of the ministers of christ and disposers of the secrets of god

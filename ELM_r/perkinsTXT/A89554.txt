guiltinesse in adams first offence and the disposition of my heart to every evill with the innumerable fruits thereof in thought spech and action quest vvhat is the remedy of these sinnes answer jesus christ the son of god made man who was crucified upon the crosse to redem all mankinde that was lost in adams disobedience in eating the forbidden fruit quest sinner how dost thou know that christ was

prayer answer a spech to god made in faith wherein i ask in the name of christ things wanting and give thanks for blessings received q vvhat owest thou to god for thy redemption answer all thankfulnesse q vvherein standeth thankfulnesse answer in new obedience which is to carry in my heart a constant puspose never to sinne any more but to endeavour to do the will of god and that within the compasse of my calling the high calling that every childe of god is called unto is not this temporall calling which god hath placed us in but our election standeth in obedience to know god will and to know what we are by nature the children of wrath and fire brands of hell if we labour not to know god and to be assured that christ hath redemed us from the second death and that the gates of hell should not prevail against us therefore our true happinesse is to labour while we have time to know our duty to god and man and to labour to know that of our selves we are lost in adams transgression and that christ hath made us fre citizens by his death and resurrection for man by nature in himself out of christ is the unhappiest of all creatures that god made therefore in these sad and perilous times we must fit our selves for a better life and whilest it is to day harden not your hearts but redem your mis spent time for the dayes are evill broad is the way that leadeth to destruction and many there be that finde it but narrow is the way that leadeth to everlasting life and few there be that finde that strait gate therefore to labour to knw christ crucified that you may be sealed for the day of redemption first taste not as adam tasted in eating the forbidden fruit for which he lost paradice for in this world paradice is wonne or lost mans life is short and fraile in comparison but a span long therefore christ bids us come buy milk without money or price god word is sweter then the honey or the honey combe therefore let us taste the benefit that we have by christ and let us relish that by belief abraham isaack jacob and all the patriarkes were justified it wet not arons beard alone but drencht his beard throughout and finally it did rain down his rich attyre how precious it is and joyfull for to se brother to hold together in the love of christ in the bonds of vnitie and he that created us for this thing is god who hath given us the earnest of his spirit for he died for all that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves but unto him which died for us and rose again therefore all they that desire to be in christ let them deny themselves and hunger and thirst after him and his righteousnesse above all the things in the world for old things are past away behold all things are become new now is the axe laid to the root of the tree every tree that bringeth not forth fruit shall be hewen down and cast into the fire therefore let us deny our own righteousnesse and cry out with saint paul o wretched man that i am who shall deliver me from this body of death therefore these thirteen principles holds forth our happinesse to know what the essence of god is in creating the world secondly to know what we are by adams disobedience in eating the forbidden fruit the which all mankinde standeth guilty of which is our originall sinne which we brought into this world till we are grafted and baptised into christs stock and made lively members of the same thirdly the mercies of god in christ that the sed of the woman should bruise the serpents head and pierce his hele all that by the eye of faith lay hold upon this promise are justified and in fulnesse of time god sent his onely b gotten son born of the virgin which was conceived by the holy ghost of whose life death and resurrection his twelve apostles are witnesses and to confirm his death and resurrection the night before he was betrayed instituted at the eating of his passeovor the sacrament as a pledge first in the breaking of bread which sets forth the breaking of his body secondly he took the cup drink ye all of this in remembrance that my body was broken and my blood shed for you and for many for the remission of sins christs sufferings upon the crosse is our glorification which fres us from the second death therefore while we have time let us have recourse to god in his ordinances for the righteous man sinned seven times in a day nay seventy seven times in a day therefore how much ned have we to renew our covenant with god and to forsake our sinnes and to loath them and condition with god to become new creatures that the guilt of sin may be taken away for christ prest upon man so oft as you take this sacrament by belief you are healed and renew your covenant with god to become new creatures let us take hed that we put not off this precious time lest we be numbred with the foolish virgin that while they went to buy oyl the wise virgin entred into the wedding chamber with the bridegroome so many put off this duty excusing themselves that they are not fitted that is the devil policie first labour to try your selves what you are by nature then the benefit you have by christ he bids us to day if you will hear my voice harden not your hearts to morrow is not ours again christ saith come unto me all that are weary and h avie laden and i will ease you therefore we ought to crave a blessing of god b prayer on all our endeavours whether in our callings or in our walking abroad or what ever we take in hand we ought always to pray to god for his blessing and to desire his kingdome to come and his will to be done for god requires nothing of us but thankfulnesse and obedience to walk with him with a purpose of newnesse of life therefore let us besech the lord in mercy to open our blinde understanding and to guide us in the right way that the commandements the articles of our belief and the lord prayer may be a savour of life unto life and not a savour of death unto death therfore let us remember our creatour in the dayes of our youth or adversitie before the evill dayes come or the yeares approach when we shall have no joy in them and to cast off our sinnes by repentance for the lord hath promised he will not leave us nor forsake us though we suffer for a season those who slight god and religion in prosperity take up religion for credit and will not endure small trials they will not suffer the power of religion to come into their hearts nor will for religion and the truth lay down their lives

it is a very necessary point to be knowne what is the least measure of grace that can befall the true childe of god less then which there is no grace effectuall to saluation for first of all the right vnderstanding of this point is the very foundation of true comfort vnto all troubled amp touched cosciences secondly it is a notable meanes to stirre vp thankefulnesse in them that haue any grace at all when they shall in examination of then selues consider that they haue receiued of god the least measure of grace or more thirdly it will be an inducement and a spurre vnto many carelesse and vnrepentant persons to embrace the gospel and to beginne repentance for their sinnes when they shall perceiue and that by the word of god that god accepts the very seed and rudiments of faith and repentance at the first though they be but in measure as a graine of musterd seed now then for opening and clearing of this point i will set downe fiue seuerall conclusions in such order as one shall confirme and explane the other and one depend vpon the other in a man there must be cosidered three things the substance of the body and soule whereof man is saide to consist the faculties placed in the soule and exercised in the body as vnderstanding will affections the integritie tegritie and puritie of the faculties whereby they are coformable to the will of god and beare his image and since the fall of adam man is not depriued of his substance or of the powers and faculties of his soule but onely of the third which is the puritie or integritie of nature and therfore the conuersion of a sinner whereof the conclusion speaketh is not the change of the substance of man or of the faculties of the soule but a renewing and restoring of that puritie and holinesse which was lost by mans fall with the abolishment of that natural corruption that is in all the powers of the soule this is the worke of god and of god alone and that on this manner first of all when it pleaseth god to worke a change in any he doth it not first in one part then afterward in another as hee that repaires a decaied house by peecemeale but the worke both for the beginning continuance and accomplishment is in the whole man and euery part at once specially in the minde conscience will and affections as on the cotrary when adam lost the image of god he lost it in euery part secondly the couersion of a sinner is not wrought all at one instant but in continuance of time amp that by certaine measures and degrees and a man is then in the first degree of his conuersion when the holy ghost by the meanes of the word inspires him with some spirituall motions amp begins to regenerate and renew the inward powers of his soule and he may in this case very fitly be compared to the night in the first dawning of the day in which though the darkenes remaine and be more in quatity then the light yet the sun hath alreadie cast some beames of light into the aire whereupon we tearme it the breaking of the day now then the very point which i teach is that a man at this instant and in this very state god as yet hauing but laid certen beginnings of true couersion in his heart is the very child of god and that not only in the eternall purpose of god as all the elect are but indeed by actuall adoption and this is plain by a manifest reason there be foure speciall workes of grace in euery child of god his vnion with christ his adoption iustification and conuersion amp these foure are wrought al at one instant so as for order of time neither goes before nor after other and yet in regard of order of nature vnion with christ iustification and adoption goe before the inward conuersion of a sinner it beeing the fruit and effect of all vpon this it followeth necessarily that a sinner in the very first act of his conuersion is iustified adopted and incorporated into the misticall bodie of christ in the parable of the prodigall son the father with ioy receiues his wicked child but when surely when he saw him comming a farre off and when as yet he had made no confession or humiliation to his father but onely had conceiued with himselfe a purpose to returne and to say father i haue sinned against heauen and against thee ampc and paul saith of many of the corinthians that he could not speake vnto them as spiritual man but as carnall eue babes in christ corinthian when dauid reprooued by nathan did but begin to repent and to say i haue sinned presently nathan the prophet of the lord said the lord hath taken away thy sin of this thing dauid seemes to speake in the psalm v i said that is i purposed and thought with my selfe i will confesse against my selfe mine vnrighteousnesse and thou forgauest mine iniquities vpon these words augustine saith marke he doth not confesse but promiseth to confesse amp god forgiueth him againe there be saith he three syllables peccaui i haue sinned and from these three syllables the flame of a sacrifice did ascend into heauen before god chrysostom saith say thou hast sinned and thou hast loosed thy sinne and ambrose saith if he said i will confesse and obtained pardon before he confessed how much more when he had confessed saying i know mine iniquitie was his sinne pardoned gregorie on this psalm saith marke how speedily pardon comes and how great is the commendation of god mercie in that pardon comes together with the desire of confession and remission comes to the heart before confession breake forth in speech the beginnings of conuersion must be distinguished some are beginnings of preparation some beginnings of composition beginnings of preparation are such as bring vnder tame amp subdue the stubbernes of mans nature without making any change at all of this sort are the accusations of the conscience by the ministerie of the law feares and terrours arising thence compunction of heart which is the apprehension of god anger against sinne nowe these and the like i exclude in the conclusion for though they goe before to prepare a sinner to his conuersion following yet are they no graces of god but fruits both of the law being the ministery of death as also of an accusing conscience beginnings of composition i tearme all those inward motions and inclinations of god spirit that follow after the worke of the law vpon the conscience and rise vpon the meditation of the gospell that promiseth righteousnes and life euerlasting by christ out of which motions the conuersion of a sinner ariseth and of which it consisteth what these are it shall afterward appeare againe grace must be distinguished it is two fold restraining grace or renuing grace restraining grace i tearme certaine common gifts of god seruing onely to order and frame the outward conuersation of man to the law of god or seruing to bereaue man of excuse in the day of iudgement by this kind of grace heathen man haue bin liberall iust sober valiant amp mercifull by it man liuing in the church of god haue beene inlightned and hauing tasted of the good word of god haue reioyced therein and for a time outwardly conformed themselues therto renewing grace is not common to al man but proper to the elect amp it is a gift of god spirit whereby the corruption of a sinner is not only restrained but also mortified and the decaied image of god restored in righteousnes and true holines now then the conclusio must only be vnderstoode of the second and not of the first for though a man haue neuer so much of this restraining grace yet vnlesse he haue the spirit of christ to create faith in the heart and to sanctifie him he is as farre from saluation as another thus then the sense and meaning of the conclusion is that the verie lest measure of sauing grace and the verie beginning or seedes of regeneration doe declare and after a sort giue title to man of all the mercifull promises of god whether they concern this life or the life to come amp are therefore approoued of god if they be in truth and accepted as greater measures of grace that which our sauiour christ saith of the worke of miracles math if ye haue faith as a graine of musterd seede ye shall say vnto this mountaine remooue hence to yonder place and it shall remooue must by the law of equall proportion be applied to sauing faith repentance the feare of god and all other graces if they be truly wrought in the heart though they be but as smal as one little graine of musterd seede they shall be sufficiently effectuall to bring forth good workes for which they are ordained the prophet esay saith that christ shall not quench the smoking flaxe nor breake the bruised reede let the comparison be marked fire in flaxe must be both little and weake in quatitie as a sparke or twain that cannot cause a flame but only a smoke specially in a matter so easie to burne here the is signified that the gifts and graces of god spirit that are both for measure amp strength as a sparke or twaine of fire shal not be neglected but rather accepted and cherished by christ when our sauiour christ heard the young man make a confession of a practise but of outward and ciuill righteousnesse he looked vpon him and loued him mark and when he heard the scribe to speake discreetely but one good speech that to loue god with all the heart is aboue all sacrifices he said vnto him that he was not for from the kingdome of heauen therefore no doubt he will loue with a more speciall loue and accept as the good subiects of his kingdome those that haue receiued a further mercie of god to be borne a new of water and the spirit lvst or desire is two folde naturall amp supernaturall naturall is that whose beginnings and obiect is in nature that is which ariseth of the naturall will of man and affecteth such things as are thought to be good according to the light of nature and this kind of desire hath his degrees yet so as they are all limited within the compasse of nature some desire riches honours pleasures some learning amp knowledge because it is the light and perfection of the minde some go further amp seeke after the vertues of iustice temperace liberality ampc and thus many heathen man haue excelled some againe desire true happinesse as balaam did who wished to die the death of the righteous because it is the propertie of nature to seeke the preseruation of it selfe but here nature staies it selfe for where the mind reueales not the will affects not supernaturall desires are such as both for their beginning and obiect are aboue nature for their beginning is from the holy ghost and the obiect or matter about which they are couersant are things diuine and spirituall which concerne the kingdome of heauen and of this kinde are the desires of which i speake in this place againe that we may not be deceiued in our desires but may the better discerne the from flittering and fleeting motions i adde three restraints first of all the desire of reconciliation the desire to beleeue or the desire to repent ampc must be constant and haue continuance otherwise it may iustly be suspected secodly it must be earnest amp serious though not alwaies yet at somtimes that we may be able to say with dauid my soule desireth after thee o lord as the thirsty land and as the hart braieth after the river of water so panteth my soule after thee o god my soule thirsteth for god euen the liuing god thirdly it must be in a touched heart for when a man is touched in conscience the heart is cast downe and as much as it can it withdrawes it selfe fro god for this cause if then there be any spirituall motions whereby the heart is lift vp vnto god they are without doubt from the spirit of god thus then i auouch that the desire of reconciliation with god in christ is reconciliation it selfe the desire to beleeue is faith indeede amp the desire to repent repentance it selfe but marke how a desire to be reconciled is not reconciliation in nature for the desire is one thing amp reconciliation is another but in god acceptation for if we being touched throughly for our sins do desire to haue them pardoned and to bee at one with god god accepts vs as reconciled againe desire to beleeue it is not faith in nature but onely in god acceptation god accepting the will for the deede that this doctrine is the will and word of god it appeares by these reasons first of all god hath annexed a promise of blessednes amp of life euerlasting to the desire of grace mat blessed are they which hunger and thirst after righteousnesse for they shall bee satisfied ioh if any man thirst let him come to mee and drinke revelation i will giue vnto him which is a thirst of the well of the water of life freely now what is this to thirst properly it is when wee are in a drought or drines and want drinke to refresh vs amp desire it and therefore by all resemblance they are saide to thirst after righteousnes that want it and would faine haue it and they thirst after christ that feele themselues out of christ and desire yes long after the blood of christ that they might be refreshed with it in their consciences here then we see that the desire of mercy in the want of mercy is the obtaining of mercie and the desire to beleeue in the want of faith is faith marke then though as yet thou want firme and liuely grace yet article thou not altogether voide of grace if thou canst vnfainedly desire it thy desire is the seede conception or bud of that which thou wantest now is the springtime of the ingrafted word or the immortall seede cast into the furrowes of thy heart waite but a while vsing the good meanes to this ende appointed and thou shalt see the leaues blossomes amp fruit will shortly follow after secodly the desire of any good thing is accepted of god as the liuely inuocation of his holy name psalm god heareth the desire of the poore psalm he will fulfill the desire of him that feareth him when moses said nothing but onely desired in heart the helpe and protection of god at the redde sea the lord said vnto him why criest thou vnto me exod and when wee know not to pray as wee ought paul saith that the spirit maketh request by the inward groanes of the heart rom hence i gather that when a man in his weaknesse praies with sighes and groanes for the gift of liuely faith the want whereof hee findes in himselfe his very praier on this manner made is as truly in acceptation with god as a praier made in liuely faith and here it is further to be considered that paul calls these groanes vnspeakable and why of most interpreters they are thought to be vnspeakable by reason of their greatnesse and this i will not denie it seemes neuerthelesse that they are so tearmed by reason of their weakenesse for they are commonly small weake and confused in the hearts of god children when they are distressed and the words following seeme to import thus much for when it had beene said that god spirit in vs makes request with grones not to be vttered some man might happily reply and say if we cannot discerne and vtter these grones in our selues what are we the better paul addes therfore that although we know not yet god a searcher of all things hidden in the heart knowes the minde and meaning of the spirit and thus the wordes yet further afoard a comfortable instruction to the children of god namely that beeing in distresse whether in life or death if by grace we can but sigh or sob vnto god though it be weake and feeble like the faint pulse in the time of death we or the spirit of god in vs doe indeede make request vnto god that shall bee heard yes as the words are wee doe more then make request and though we do not alwaies see what god spirit makes vs to sigh after yet god doeth to the testimonie of scripture i adde the testimonies of godly and learned man not to prooue the doctrine in hand but to shew a consent and to prooue thus much that the thing which i auouch is no priuate phantasie of any man easily saith ambrose of god is he reconciled si impens rogatur on psalm if he be instantly intreated augustine saith let thy desire be before him and thy father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly for thy desire is thy praier and if thy desire be continuall thy praier is continuall hee addes further in the same place that the desire is a continuall voice and the cry of the heart and the inward inuocation of god which may be made without intermission againe to desire the helpe of grace is the beginning of grace againe exposit epistle john tract cap the whole life of a good christian is an holy will and desire and that which thou desirest thou seest not but by desiring article as it were inlarged and made capable that whe it shall come which thou shalt see thou maist bee filled basil saith onely thou must will and god will come of his owne accord sup cant ser bernard saith what is not desire a voice yes a very strong voice god heareth the desire of the poore and a continuall desire though wee speake nothing it is a voice continued tomorrow pag luther saith christ is then truely omnipotent and then truly raignes in vs when wee are so weake that wee can scarce giue any groane for paul saith that one such groane is a strong crie in the cares of god filling both heauen amp earth ib fol againe very fewe know how weake and small faith and hope is vnder the crosse and in temptation for it appeares then to bee as smoking flaxe which a good blast of winde would praesently put out but such as beleeue in these combates and terrours against hope vnder hope that is opposing themselues by faith in the promise of christ against the feeling of sinne and the wrath of god doe finde afterward that this litle sparke of faith as it appeares to reason which hardly perceiueth it is peraduenture as the whole element of fire which filleth all heauen and swalloweth vp all terrours and sinnes lib fol againe the more wee finde our vnworthinesse and the lesse wee finde the promises to belong vnto vs the more must wee desire them beeing assured that this desire doth greatly please god who desireth and willeth that his grace should bee earnestly desired this doeth faith which iudgeth it a pretious thing and therefore greatly hungreth and thirsteth after it and so obtaines it for god is delighted to fill the hungrie with good things amp to send the rich emptie away resp ad acta colloq monpel theodore beza saith if thou finde not thine heart inwardly touched pray that it may bee touched for then must thou know that this desire is a pledge of the fathers will to thee locor com par kenitius saith when i haue a good desire though it do scarcely shew it selfe in some little and slender sigh i must be assured that the spirit of god is present and worketh his good worke catechis vrsinus saith faith in the most holy man in this life is imperfect and weake yet neuerthelesse whosoeuer fecles in his heart an earnest desire and a striuing against his naturall doubtings both can and must assure himselfe that he is indued with true faith againe wicked man doe not desire the grace of the holy spirit whereby they may resist sinne and therefore they are iustly depriued of it for hee that earnestly desireth the holy ghost hath it alreadie because this desire of the spirit cannot be but from the spirit as it is saide blessed are they that hunger and thirst after righteousnesse for they shall bee satisfied epistle to carelesse bradford saith thy sins are vndoubtedly pardoned ampc for god hath giuen thee a penitent and beleeuing heart that is an heart which desireth to repent and beleeue for such an one is taken of him he accepting the will for thee deede for a penitent and beleeuing heart indeede booke of the markes of god children taffine saith our faith may be so small and weake as it doth not yet bring forth fruits that may bee liuely felt of vs but if they which feele themselues in such estate desire to haue these feelings namely of god fauour and loue if they aske them at god hands by praier this desire and praier are testimonies that the spirit of god is in them and that they haue faith alreadie for is such a desire a fruit of the flesh or of the spirit it is of the holy spirit who bringeth it forth onely in such as hee dwells in ampc then these holy desires and praiers being the motions of the holy ghost in vs are testimonies of our faith although they seeme to vs small and weake as the woman that feeleth the moouing of a childe in her body though very weake assureth her selfe that shee hath conceiued and that shee goeth with a liue child so if wee haue these motions these holy affections and desires beforementioned let vs not doubt but that wee haue the holy ghost who is the author of them dwelling in vs and consequently that we haue also faith again he saith if thou hast begun to hate and she sinne if thou feelest that thou article displeased at thine infirmities and corruptions if hauing offended god thou feelest a griefe and a sorrow for it if thou desire to abstaine if thou auoidest the occasion if thou trauailest to doe thy endeauour if thou praiest to god to giue thee grace all these holy affections proceeding from none other then from the spirit of god ought to be so many pledges and testimonies that he is in thee n masterknockes saith albeit your paines sometimes be so horrible that you finde no release nor comfort neither in spirit nor bodie yet if they heart can onely sob vnto god despaire not you shall obtaine your hearts desire and destitute you are not of faith for at such a time as the flesh naturall reason the law of god the present torment the diuell at one doe crie god is angrie and therefore there is neither helpe nor remedie to be hoped for at his hads at such time isay to sob vnto god is the demonstration of the secret seede of god which is hidden in god elect children and that onely sob is vnto god a more acceptable sacrifice then without this crosse to giue our body to be burnt euen for the truthes sake more testimonies might be alleadged but these shall suffice against this point of dotrine it may be alleadged that if desire to beleeue in our weakenesse be faith indeede then some are iustified and may be saued wanting a liuely apprehension and full perswasion of god mercie in christ ans iustifying faith in regard of his nature is alwaies one and the same and the essentiall propertie thereof is to apprehend christ with his benefites and to assure the very coscience thereof and therefore without some apprehension and assurance there can bee no iustification or saluation in them that for age are able to beleeue yet there bee certaine degrees and measures of true faith there is a strong faith which causeth a full apprehension and perswasion of god mercie in christ this measure of faith the lord vouchsafed abraham dauid paul the prophets apostles and martyrs of god it were a blessed thing if all beleeuers might attaine to this height of liuely faith to say with paul i am perswaded that neither life nor death nor any thing else shal bee able to separate vs from the loue of god in christ but all cannot therfore there is another degree of faith lower then the former and yet true faith called a litle or weake faith and it also hath a power to apprehend and applie the promise of saluation but as yet by reason of weaknes it is infolded as it were and wrapt vp in the heart as the leafe and blossome in the bud for such persons as haue this weake faith can say indeede that they beleeue their sinnes to be pardonable and that seriously in their hearts they desire to haue them pardoned but as yet they can not say that they are without all doubt pordoned and yet the mercie of god is not wating vnto them for in that they doe and can desire and indeauour to apprehed they doe indeed apprehend god accepting the desire to doe the thing for the thing done this which i say will the better appeare if the groundes thereof be considered faith doth not iustifie in respect of it selfe because it is an action or vertue or because it is strong liuely and perfect but in respect of the obiect thereof namely christ crucified whom faith apprehendeth as he is set forth vnto vs in the word and sacraments it is christ that is the author and matter of our iustice and it is he that applieth the same vnto vs as for faith in vs it is but an instrument to apprehend amp receiue that which christ for his part offereth and giueth therefore if faith erre not in his proper obiect but follow the promise of god though it doe but weakely apprehend or at the least cause a man onely to endeauour and desire to apprehend it is true faith and iustifieth though our apprehension be necessarie yet our saluation stands rather in this that god apprehends vs for his owne then that we apprehend him for ours phi v and rather in this that we are knowne of him then that we know him gal that is if man endeauour to please god in all things god will not iudge their doings by the rigour of his law but will accept their litle and weake endeauour to do that which they can do by his grace as if they had perfectly fulfilled the lawe but heere remember i put this caueat that this indeeuour must bee in and by the whole man the very minde conscience will and affections doing that which they can in their kindes and thus the endeauour to obey which is a fruit of the spirit shall bee distinguished from ciuil righteousnesse which may bee in heathen man and is onely in the outward and not in the inward man the trueth of this conclusion appeares by that which the prophet malachi saith that god will spare the that feare him as a father spares his childe who accepts the thing done as well done if the child shew his good will to please his father and to doe what he can vnderstand this conclusion as the former namely that griefe of the hart for the want of any grace necessarie to saluation is as much with god as the grace it selfe whe beeing in distresse we cannot pray as we ought god accepts the very groanes sobs and sighes of the perplexed heart as the praier it selfe rom when we are grieued because we cannot be grieued for our sinnes it is a degree amp measure of godly sorrow before god augustine saith well sometimes our praier is lukewarme or rather cold and almost no praier nay sometime it is altogether no praier at all and yet we cannot with griefe perceiue this in our selues for if we can but grieue because we cannot pray we now pray indeede hierom saith then we are iust when we doe acknowledge our selues to be sinners againe this is the true wisedome of man to know himselfe to be imperfect and that i may so speake the perfection of all iust man in the flesh is imperfect augustine again saith that the vertue which is nowe in a iust man is thus farre forth perfect that vnto the perfection thereof there belongs a true acknowledgement and an humble confession of the imperfection thereof a broken and contrite heart after an offence is as much with god as if there had bin no offence at al and therefore so soone as dauid after his grieuous fall in heauinesse of heart confessed his sinne saying in effect but thus much i haue sinned the prophet in the name of the lord pronounceth the pardon of his sinne in heauen and that presently svndry persons by the euangelists are said to beleeue which had onely seene the miracles of christ and as yet had made no further proceedings but to acknowledge christ to be the messias and to submit themselues to him amp his doctrine which afterward should be taught on this maner the woman of samaria belieued and many of the samaritans vpon her report and a certaine ruler by reason of a miracle wrought vpon his son is said to beleeue and all his houshold ioh when our sauiour christ commended the faith of the apostles terming it a rocke against which the gates of hell should not preuaile it was not the plentifull knowledge of the doctrine of saluation for they were ignorant of many articles of faith as namely of the death resurrection ascention and kingdome of christ but because they beleeued him to be the son of god amp the sauiour of mankinde and they had withall resolued themselues to cleaue vnto him and the blessed doctrine of saluation which hee taught though as yet they were ignorant in many points the holy ghost commendeth the faith of rahab when shee receiued the spies now this her faith was indeed but a seed and beginning of liuely faith for then shee had onely heard of the miracles done in egypt and of the deliuerance of the israelites and was thereupon smitten with feare and had conceiued a resolution with her selfe to ioyne her selfe to the israelites and to worship the true god now these and the like are tearmed beleeuers upon iust cause for though they bee ignorant as yet yet their ignorance shall bee no continuing or lasting ignorance and they haue excellent seedes of grace namely a purpose of hart to cleaue to christ and a care to profit in the doctrine of saluation whereof they haue some litle knowledge the wickednesse of mans nature and the depth of hypocrisie is such that a man may amp can easily transforme himselfe into the counterfeit and resemblance of any grace of god therefore i put downe in this last conclusion a certaine note whereby the gifts of god may be discerned namely that they grow vp and increase as the graine of musterd seede to a great tree and beare fruit answerably the grace in the heart is like the graine of musterd seede in two things first it is small to see to at the beginning secondly after it is cast into the ground of the heart it increaseth speedily and spreads it selfe therefore if a man at the first haue but some litle feeling of his wants some weake and faint desire some small obedience he must not let this sparke of grace goe out but these motions of the spirit must be increased by the vse of the word sacraments and praier and they must daily bee stirred vp by meditating endeauouring striuing asking seeking knocking the master deliuering his talents to his servant saith vnto them occupie till i come aud not hide in the earth matth paul vseth an excellent speech to timothie i exhort thee to stirre vp the gift of god which is in thee namely as fire is stirred vp by often blowing and putting to of wood tim as for such motions of the heart that last for a weeke or a moneth and after vanish away they are not to bee regarded amp the lord by the prophet ose complaineth of them saying o ephraim thy righteousnes is like the morning dewe chap therefore considering grace vnlesse it be confirmed and exercised is indeede no grace i will heere adde certaine rules of direction that wee may the more easily put in practise the spirituall exercises of inuocation faith and repentance and thereby also quicken and reuiue the seed and beginnings of grace in what place soeuer thou article whether alone or abroad by day or by night and whatsoeuer thou article doing set thy selfe in the presece of god let this perswasion alwaies take place in thy hart that thou are before the liuig god and do thy endeauour that this perswasion may smite thy heart with awe and reuerence and make thee afraid to sin this councell the lord gaue abraham gen walke before me and be vpright this thing also was practised by enoch who for this cause is said to walke with god esteeme of euery present day as of the day of thy death and therefore liue as though thou were dying and doe those good duties euery day that thou wouldest doe if thou were dying this is christian watchfulnesse and remember it make catalogues and bills of thine owne sinnes specially of those sinnes that haue most dishonoured god and wounded thine owne conscience set them before thee ofte specially then whe thou hast any particular occasion of renewing thy repentance that thy heart by this dolefull sight may bee further humbled this was dauids practise when hee considered his waies and turned his feet to god commandements psalm and when he confessed the sinnes of his youth psalm this was iobs practise when he said he was not able to answer one of a thousand of his sinnes vnto god iob when thou first openest thine eyes in a morning pray to god and giue him thankes heartily god then shall haue his honour and thy heart shall be the better for it the whole day following for we see in experience that vessels keepe long the taste of that liquor wherwith they are first seasoned and when thou liest downe let that be the last also for thou knowest not whether fallen a sleepe thou shalt euer rise againe aliue good therefore it is that thou shouldest giue vp thy selfe into the hands of god whilst thou article waking labour to see and feele thy spirituall pouerty that is to see the want of grace in thy selfe specially those inward corruptions of vnbeliefe pride selfe loue ampc labour to be displeased with thy self and labour to feele that by reason of them thou standest in neede of euery drop of the blood of christ to heale and clense thee from those wants and let this practise take such place with thee that if thou be demaunded what in thine estimation is the vilest of the creatures vpon earth thine heart and conscience may answer with a loud voice i euen i by reason of mine owne sinnes and againe if thou be demaunded what is the best thing in the world for thee thy heart and conscience may answer againe with a strong and loud crie one drop of the blood of christ to wash away my sinnes shew thy selfe to bee a member of christ and a servant of god not only in the generall calling of a christian but also in the particular calling in which thou article placed it is nothing for a magistrate to be a christia man but he must also be a christian magistrate it is not inough for a master of a family to be a christia man or a christia in the church but the must also be a christia in the family amp in the trade which he followeth daily not euery one that is a common hearer of the word and a frequenter of the lord table is therefore a good christian vnlesse his conuersation in his priuate house and in his priuate affaires amp dealings be sutable there is a man to be seene what he is search the scriptures to see what is sinne and what is not sinne in euery action this done carry in thy heart a constant and resolute purpose not to sin in any thing for faith and the purpose of sinning can neuer stand together let thine endeauour be sutable to thy purpose and therefore doe nothing at any time against thy conscience ritely enformed by the word exercise thy selfe to eschew euery sinne and to obey god in euery one of his commandements that pertaine either to the generall calling of a christian or thy particular calling thus did good iosias who turned vnto god with all his heart according to all the lawe of moses king and thus did zachary and elizabeth that walked in all the commandements of god without reproofe luke if at any time against thy purpose and resolution thou bee ouertaken with any sinne little or great lie not in it but speedily recouer thy selfe by repentance humble thy selfe confessing thine offence and by praier intreat the lord to pardon the same and that earnestly till such time as thou findest thy conscience truly pacified and thy care to eschew the same sinne increased consider often of the right and proper ende of thy life in this world which is not to seeke profit honour pleasure but that in seruing of man wee might serue god in our callings god could if it so pleased him preserue man without the ministry of man but his pleasure is to fulfil his worke and will in the preseruation of our body and saluation of our soules by the imploiment of man in his seruice euery one according to his vocation neither is there so much as a bond slaue but he must in and by his faithful seruice to his master serue the lord man therefore doe commonly profane their labours and liues by aiming at a wrong ende when all their care consisteth onely in getting sufficient maintenance for them and theirs for the obtaining of credit riches amp carnall comodities for thus man serue themselves amp not god or man much lesse doe they serue god in seruing of man giue all diligence to make thy election sure and to gather manifold tokens thereof for this cause obserue the worke of god prouidence loue and mercy both in thee and vpon thee from time to time for the serious consideration of them and the laying of them together when they are many and seuerall minister much direction assurance of god fauour and comfort this was the practise of dauid sam psalm all thinke euermore thy present estate whatsoeuer it bee to bee the best estate for thee because whatsoeuer befalls thee though it bee sicknes or any other affliction or death befals thee of the good prouidence of god that this may the better bee done labour to see and acknowledge a prouidence of god as wel in pouertie as in abundance as well in disgrace as good report as well in sickenes as in health as well in life as in death pray continually i meane not by solemne amp set praier but by secret and inward eiaculatios of the heart that is by a continuall eleuation of minde vnto christ sitting at the right hand of god the father and that either by prayer or giuing of thankes so often as any occaon shall be offered thinke often of the worst and most grieuous things that may befall thee either in this life or death for the name of christ make a reckoning of them and prepare thy selfe to beare them that when they come they may not seeme strange but be borne the more easily make conscience of idle vaine vnhonest and vngodly thoughts for these are the seedes and beginnings of actuall sin in word amp in deed this want of care in ordering and composing of our thoughts is often punished with a fearefull temptation in the very thought called of diuines tentatio blasphemiarum a tentation of blasphemies when any good motion or affection riseth in the heart suffer it not passe away but feede it by reading meditating praying whatsoeuer good thing thou goest about whether it be in word or deed do it not in a conceit of thy selfe or in the pride of thy heart but in humility ascribing the power whereby thou doest thy worke and the praise thereof to god otherwise thou shalt finde by experience god will curse thy best doings despise not ciuill honestie good conscience and good maners must goe togither therefore remember to make conscience of lying and of customable swearing in common talke contend not either in deede or word with any man be curteous and gentle to all good and badde beare with mens wants and frailties as hastinesse frowardnesse selfeliking curiousnesse ampc passing by them as being not perceiued returne not euill for euill but rather good for euill vse meate drinke and apparell in that manner and measure that they may further godlinesse and may be as it were signes in which thou maiest expresse the hidden grace of thy heart striue not to goe beyond any vnlesse it be in good things goe before thine equals in giuing of honour rather then in taking of it make conscience of thy word and let it bee as a bond professe no more outwardly the thou hast inwardly in heart opresse or defraud no man in bargaining in all company either doe good or take good cleaue not by inordinate affection to any creature but aboue all things quiet amp rest thy mind in christ aboue all dignitie and honour aboue all cunning and policie aboue all glorie and honour aboue all health and beautie aboue all wealth and treasure aboue all ioy and delight aboue al fame amp praise aboue all mirth and consolation that mans heart can feele or deuise beside christ with these rules of practise ioyne rules of meditation whereof i propound sixe vnto thee as i finde them set downe by a learned diuine called victorius strigelius wee must not fall away from god for any creature infinite eternitie is farre to be preferred before the short race of this mortall life we must hold fast the promise of grace though wee loose all temporall blessings and they also in death must needes be left let the loue of god in christ and the loue of the church for christ be strong in thee and preuaile against all other affections it is the principall arte of a christian to beleeue things inuisible to hope for things deferred to loue god when hee shewes him to be an enemie and thus to perseuere vnto the ende it is a most effectual remedy for any griefe to quiet our selues in a confidence of the presence and helpe of god and to aske of him and withall to waite either for some easement or deliuerance all the works of god are done in contrarie meanes

my purpose in choosing this text is to speake of the three first chapters of this booke namely the seuen seuerall epistles written to the churches in asia which containe sundrie vses amp instructions fit for our time and age before we come to the matter we must consider of one question which is whether this present booke of the reuelation be canonicall or not for some haue heretofore amp some now do call the authoritie of it in question but we hold that it is canonicall of equall authoritie with other canonicall scriptures our arguments and reasons be these the first is because the doctrine contained in this booke is apostolicall as anie which diligently reades the booke may perceiue secondly because the style and maner of opening and expounding the prophecie contained in it is apostolicall that is plaine simple and easie if we consider that it is a prophecie thirdly because this booke hath bene approued generally of all churches refused of no one church in any age since john wrote it amp it was neuer called into questio but of some particular man neuer of any whole church fourthly the things foretold in this booke came to passe as they were foretold as among the rest in one for all may appeare by that signe john saw in the thirteenth chapter two beast came one out of the sea the second out of the earth the first signifying the romaine empire the second the romaine apostaticall church which both are come to passe in this last age now follow the reasons which some alleage to proue it not canonicall but they be all of no force first s john he names him selfe in this booke where he neuer named himselfe once in all his gospell no not then when he had iust occasion to name him selfe but sought to auoid it therefore they conclude that it is not his booke but written by some other and published in his name the reason is not good for there is great difference betweene an historie and a prophecie s john in his historie doth not name himselfe for there is no necessarie reason why one in an historie of another man should name himself but in a prophecie as this booke is it is more requisite he should mention his owne name and so did other prophets as ieremiah mentioneth his name in his booke at least an hundred times so esay and daniel in euerie chapter mention their names then seeing they do it so often it is no maruell if s john in his booke repeate his name yet he doth it but fiue times in the whole booke they obiect that his style in this booke is not the same with that he vsed in the penning of the gospell ans the difference of the stile riseth from the difference of the matter seeing there he writes an historie here he pens a prophecie againe here he writes not his own words but those which he receiued from christ by particular reuelation they say his booke hath bene reiected in diverse ages as not canonicall ans it cannot be proued that it was euer refused of any generall church but of some priuate man now the disallowing of any priuate man cannot make a whole booke to be reiected for then the epistle to the hebrewes and iames his epistle should not be canonicall which be receiued of all churches now come to the words which containe two parts first a preface secondly a vision the preface first containes an entrance to his matter from the first to the ninth verse the vision from the ninth to the end of the chapter the preface hath two parts first the title of the booke secondly the inscription the title in the three first verses the inscription from the fourth to the ninth verse the title in these words the reuelation of iesus christ ampc a reuelation is nothing else but a manifestation or discouerie of things secret in respect of man for the common good of the church and so this word is taken here reuelations from god in the scriptures were of three kinds first by dreames secondly by vision thirdly by created voice of god face to face as we may see number partly by vision partly by voice now this was not by dreame for he receiued these things not by dreame vision or voyce alone but by vision from christ and by voice from god so then it is mixt partly receiued by vision partly by voice vttered from god in these three first verses the reuelation is described by seuen arguments first by the author iesus christ secondly the end thirdly the persons to whom it was directed fourthly the matter fiftly the instrument sixtly the manner of deliuering it seuenthly the fruit of the reuelation the first argument by which it pleaseth the holy ghost to describe this reuelation is the author vz iesus christ he is the author of it it comes from him it is called his reuelation in these respects first not to exclude the father and the holy ghost but to shew the speciall office of christ for the peculiar office belonging to the second person is to reueale and to publish and to manifest the will of god the father to the church and for that cause he is called the angell of the couenant the doctor of the church the wisedome of the father because his office is to reueale the will of his father to man secondly it is called the reuelation of iesus christ to teach vs to put difference betweene this reuelation and all satanicall reuelations for as god hath his true reuelations so satan his ape hath his counterfeit reuelations and deliuers them in shew like to god but they differ much first the diuels reuelations be for the most part ambiguous and doubtfull that a man cannot tell how to take the speech and phrase he giues them in but the reuelations of god and that in this booke are certaine and in plaine tearmes deliuered secondly the diuels reuelations be betweene him and his instruments wicked and bad man these in this and other bookes be to the godly to his children and servant as here to john and the church thirdly the diuels tend to maintaine idolatry errors and wickednesse deut these to maintaine true apostolicall doctrine and the true worship of god thirdly it is called christs reuelation to shew that christ now ascending into heauen and entred into his kingly office doth still rule order and gouerne his church and for that cause it is not called the reuelation of god the father or of the holy ghost but of iesus christ because he guides and gouernes the church seeing christ iesus now ascended into heauen entred into his kingly office doth giue his church reuelations we see his constant care of his church in this last age of the world for as in the first age he gaue doctrine necessarie for saluation and that time and after he gaue his church prophecies so in the new testamet he published the doctrine of the prophets plainly and also the doctrine of faith amp repentance by the apostles and now after all these being ascended vp into heauen he hath no lesse care of his church for he hath giuen it now in this last age a notable prophecy and reuelation by john which god gaue vnto him these words be added to shew how he came by this reuelation and whence he had it he had it giuen him of the father and these words explane the former to shew that christ was the author of it god gaue him that is god the father not the whole trinitie for where this name god is opposed to christ there it signifies the first person namely god the father and the first person is often called by this name alone god because he is first in order and the fountaine of the deitie for christ receiues his diuine nature and godhead from the father by communication the holy ghost from them both the father receiues it from none god gaue to him how can it be giuen to christ seeing he was god and had all things ans we conceiue of christs wayes first as he is god secondly as he is mediator and head of the church and so he is both god and man as he is god the father giues him nothing seeing he is by nature the same with the father in all things saue in proprietie of persons secondly he is conceiued as the mediator not god simply but god man or god made man and so he is said to receiue of the father in respect of his manhood as he is god man or god incarnate so he saith all power is giuen me of the father mat that is as he is mediator and god incarnate and head of his church philipp god gaue him a name ampc not as he was simply god but as he was mediator and in his manhood so here the reuelation was giuen him not as he was god simply but as he was head of the church mediator and god incarnate neither can any say hence christ shall be inferiour to the father in regard of his godhead for he receiues it from the father as he is god man not simply god and as he is man and mediator he is inferiour to the father and confesseth that in that respect god the father is greater then all and paule saith god the father is the head of christ corinthian as christ is the head of the church god man nay as christ sits at his fathers right hand he is inferiour to him not as god but as mediatour and looke as he receiues all power of the father so must he restore it againe as he is head of the church now followeth the meanes how he gaue christ this reuelalation he gaue it to christ and made him lord of it so that he made this his royaltie and priuiledge for christ being king of his church and this booke of reuelation being part of his lawe to the church he is king also of this booke as part of his law and royaltie againe they were reuealed to christ before they were reuealed to any creature man or angel and that as he was man for his manhood being vnited to his godhead he could not but know them ere any man or angell knew them as he was man first we obserue that this booke of canonicall scripture is christs he is lord of it and the right of it belongs to him alone for as the lawes of a land belong to a prince and to none else so these lawes the bookes of this scripture they be christs as his royaltie amp priuiledge for god gaue them to him and to none but him only and he sent his angels to reueale it to the church now that which is said of this booke may be said of all the bookes of scripture that as the royaltie and interest of this belongs onely to christ being giuen to him alone so the same followes of all other then hence i gather no man in the world hath authoritie aboue these lawes aboue this booke for this is christs priuiledge nor of any other by proportio for these be christs lawes al must be subiect to them none must be aboue them for then it should follow that they were giuen to man as well as to christ iesus hence it followeth that if all be subiect to these lawes then no man hath authoritie to dispense with the scriptures or the gospell of christ for that is to make man to haue royaltie interest and title into these scriptures monarches and princes haue great authoritie in their iurisdictions but they must all be in subiection to these lawes of christ for they be indeed great amp haue authoritie ouer their subiects yes more ouer all causes yet only those which be the causes of man they haue no authoritie in causes of god as the scriptures and the sacraments seeing these bookes be christs royaltie and he alone hath soueraigne interest in the church authoritie we note that he alone can expound scripture without helpe of scripture he alone can giue the true sense of scripture indeed man can giue the sense of scripture by scripture for they haue a ministerie here and by scripture they expound scripture but christ alone without scripture can giue the true sense of scripture this condemnes the popish doctrine which giues the church absolute power and authoritie to expound and determine of scripture without helpe of the scripture for that is to take christ his royaltie and priuiledge and to giue it to man but christ alone hath absolute authoritie to determine of his owne lawes man indeed in the church haue a ministeriall iudgment by helpe of the scriptures we see the excellencie of all the scriptures which is the same with this booke now this booke it is the gift of god to christ iesus his son yes a most excellent gift now this is not affirmed by any writings of man though neuer so excellent this should teach vs to reuerence the scriptures more then any mens writings whatsoeuer then this sheweth the blindnes of this age which delight onely in the hearing and reading the writings of man contemning the word of god and yet the writings of man be sinfull and erronious euery way imperfect the writings of god holy certain and euery way absolute being giuen to the son as he is king priest and prophet to shew to his servant cocerning this testament shortly to be done in these words be arguments for the description of this reuelatio first the end vz to shew it secondly the persons his servant thirdly the matter of it vz things shortly to be reuealed the end of this reuelation was to manifest amp declare to his servant to wit the church of god his servant and children to publish to them those things which should shortly be fulfilled and this is the maine drift of this reuelation hence then we note that the papists erre who say that lay man should not haue the word but barre them the reading of the scriptures but the holy ghost saith this reuelation was to reueale things to come not onely to the clergie nor to the doctors of the church but to his servant if so then to the lay man as well as the clergie vnlesse they will say he is none of his servant then this i gather if that this booke being most hard must be learned of the lay man then those bookes which be not so hard must be learned and read and much more those which be more easie as the historie of the gospell the epistles ampc secondly the persons are the servant of christ this booke then of reuelation belongs not to all man indifferently but it is written for the servant of christ that is such as repent of their sinnes beleeue truly in christ and shew their faith by the fruites thereof in their liues and so the lord saith he will reueale his secrets to his servant the prophets and the lord will not keepe backe but reueale to abraham the things he was to bring vpon sodome and gomorrha then seeing those to who the lord shewes his will to whom he declares this book and others they must be his servant we must not content our selues only to heare the word and receiue the sacraments but we must seeke to be his servant we must repent truly beleeue in christ and shew this faith in obedience and then the lord will more and more daily acquaint vs with his will and the cause why we heare the word daily and neuer profit but be as ignorant and blind as before the cause is because we be not his servant we be bare hearers neuer practise that we heare in faith and obedience we repent not neither liue a new life by repentance in new obedience for else if the lord see any which is his true servant he approues of him he likes of him and acquaints him daily with his will and word increaseth his knowledge and obedience secondly seeing that this reuelation is written for the servant of iesus christ i obserue that christ is true god the reason is because they be called his servant that is christs the reason stands thus he which is lord of the church amp the members thereof and also of angels as it followeth after he is true god but christ is lord of man and angels ergo he is true god his servant not to all man to the whole world and euery singular man but to his servant hereby we see the opinion of those which hold god would haue all to be saued and cals all man is false for if he called all effectually then he would offer al the meanes to wit the word of god that so they might be called but he writes it not to all but to his servant now that which is true of this booke is true of the whole scripture the lord shewed his word to iacob not to all the world not to all nation as to him psalm he shewed to iacob that is his true members his servant and true christians now followeth the matter which is the fourth argument of the description of this reuelation vz things which shortly must come to passe and in this the matter of this booke is distinguished from all other bookes of the scripture which speake generally of things either present or now past but this speakes of things to come the matter of this booke is described by two arguments first these things be necessarie they must be done secondly by the circumstance of time shortly or quickly first the matter is things to come which must be done so speakes the holy ghost in many places of the word as christ saith shewing the necessitie offences must come so paule saith there must be heresies act we must through manie tribulations enter into heauen ampc so to timothy they which be godly must suffer afflictions shewing in all these places that things which are to come must necessarily come to passe but this doctrine agrees not with mans reason though it be the will of god for man will say if all things come to passe necessarily then it takes away mans free will for necessitie and free will can not stand together answer they may indeed constraint and mans will can not stand but mans will and vnchangeable necessitie may stand both together as i shew thus in god there is absolute free will yet he doth many things of necessitie as he willeth that which is good necessarily for he can not possibly will that which is euill but willes that which is good most freely so christ he died necessarily he could not but die for he died in regard of god counsell and yet he died most willingly and gaue himselfe most freely to die when he suffered death ergo these two mans free will and vnchangeable necessitie though not constraint may stand together man will obiect againe if things come to passe by necessitie then it is in vaine to vse anie meanes as to heare the word receiue the sacraments for god will must come to passe do we what we will do answer these man must consider that as god hath appointed what things must come to passe so he hath appointed the meanes how they must come to passe then seeing the lord hath appointed as well the meanes as the ende we should by this necessitie rather be induced to vse the meanes then not to vse them to make this more plaine we must know there is a double necessitie one is absolute another is but in part i call that absolute necessitie which can not be otherwise possibly as that god liues it cannot be otherwise he is omnipotent he cannot but be so there is a necessitie which is not absolute but in part as when anie thing done is necessarie because it depends on necessarie causes as fire to burne this is not absolutely necessarie but in part because it depends on that order which god set in things in the creation it is not absolute for if god should change that order in the creation then it may be fire should ceasse to burne as it did in the three children in the ouen now in this place where he saith these things must be done it is not to be meant of absolute necessitie but of that which is but in part for they must come to passe necessarily onely in regard of god decree in them selues they be contingent necessary by the vnchangeable decree of god in regard of which decree of god all things which come to passe be necessarie yet can it not be inferred therefore man hath no free will for this necessitie taketh it not away neither the second causes but rather disposeth them and inclines mans free will secondly the matter is described by the time shortly or quickly but how can this be true seeing things spoken of in this booke came not to passe a thousad years after which is a log time ans they may be said to come to passe shortly though a thousand yeares after in two respects first of god to whom a thousand years is but as one day secondly in regard of man for though a thousand years seeme a long time to man ere it be expired yet when it is once past it seemes but a short time which must shortly come he sets downe these wordes for two causes first to terrifie all carnall and carelesse man for it foretelleth iudgements and destructions to those which liue in their sinnes which be enemy to the church of god and so it strikes a terror into their hearts seeing their destruction comes shortly and no doubt if anie carnall man could lay this to his heart that iudgement must come quickly it would rowze him if he belonged to christ or else would terrifie his soule we here liue still in our sinnes though we heare the word daily we neuer repent of our sinnes but if we which be so carelesse wold consider that destruction and iudgement must come shortly to those which be carelesse it would stirre vs vp to repentance if we had anie grace let these carelesse man let these consider that the hand of god may be on them quickly take hold on them ere they be aware let the young man not runne on in his sins lest the lord come ere he be prepared and prouided for the lord will come quickly his iudgements they make hast and are not farre off they delay not secondly the holy ghost setteth downe this circumstance of time to arme the servant of christ the true members of the church against all persecutions afflictions amp calamities which might befall them for the children of god being afflicted and crossed they might be impatient and discouraged but lest they should be so the lord here telleth them that his coming shall be shortly they shall not alwayes beare the heauie burthen of afflictions on their shoulders but for a while a short time and then the lord will come and ease them deliuer them and comfort their troubled minds lest they should be swallowed vp with griefe it followeth which he sent that is which reuelation he sent and shewed by his angell these words are set downe for two causes first to shew that s john he opened and published this booke not rashly but by calling and warrant from god this teacheth vs what must be our dutie in all our actions whatsoeuer we take in hand we must looke we haue our calling and warrant this was the apostles practise as here s iohns he opened not this reuelation before he had speciall warrant so must we looke for our warrant in the word and till we haue it we must not enterprise anie thing if this dutie were practised there would be more conscience in the seruice and worship of god more care and conscience in our dealings with man then there is secondly he setteth downe these words to get more reuerence and greater authoritie to this booke that it might more be accepted of and therefore he saith it was sent by an angell to the church and this is a verie good reason to get credite to it and reuerence for if an earthly prince should write his letter to his subiect and withall send it by one of his gard no doubt the subiect would receiue it most reuerently the scriptures they be the epistle of god sent to his church not by anie but by his angell then this should procure a thousand times more reuerence seeing god sends his letter to his apostle s john and so to the church by the hand of an angell now followeth the fifth argument of the description of this reuelation which is the instruments of this reuelation whereby it is conueyed from god to the church and these be two first an angell secondly john the apostle or euangelist the first instrument is an angell by whom he sent this reuelation to conuey it to his church and so the lord hath vsed their ministerie in other places of the scriptures so when the law was giuen it was by the hand of an angel daniel had many of his dreames expounded by an angell and the seuen visions in this booke of the reuelation were shewed to john by an angell yet we must take heede we gather not hence that we may worship them or pray to them because they be present about vs and see our wants but before we pray to them we must haue a commandement from god and a speciall promise that they can and will heare and helpe vs else we must not pray to them the second instrument is john the apostle and euangelist which penned one of the gospels that disciple whom iesus loued son to zebedeus kinsman to christ now to procure credit and more reuerence to his reuelatio he describeth himselfe by two arguments first calling himselfe his servant john secondly by an effect which bare record ampc first he cals him selfe the servant of christ not the disciple of christ not christ his cosin or kinsman which he might haue done but he cals himself the servant of christ for he had learned that which christ speaks mat he which doth the will of my father he is my mother sister and brother not he which is kinsma or cosin but in this to do his fathers wil stands the note of his kinsman and in this to be the servant of christ stands the dignitie of a christian had not the blessed virgin christs mother bene a servant of christ she had neuer bin saued by christ then by this we see it is nothing to helpe a man to saluation to be borne of great kinred to come of princes amp noble bloud but to be the servant of christ to do the will of christ this is to be allyed and cosin to christ and if we will be the servant of christ we must become new creatures we must leaue off our old seruice and as s paule saith he knewe not christ in the flesh but serued him in the spirit and we must not content our selues to be his servant in the generall calling of a christian but in our particular callings for s john was his servant not onely in beleeuing in him and obeying him generally but in beleeuing and obeying him in the particular calling of an apostle so paule he was the servant of christ not only generally but in the speciall calling of the gospell in preaching the same this example of his and the apostles must be our direction we must not content our selues with the generall calling of christians but serue christ in our particular callings it is not inough to professe christ in publike assemblies to heare the word receiue the sacraments but in our particular callings we must serue him at home as the magistrate not onely in his generall calling of christianitie but in his particular calling as he is a magistrate the minister as he is a minister the maister of a familie as he is a maister and so all man in their particular callings must obey christ and if the maister of a familie come to the assembly heare the word receiue the sacraments yet in his familie faile and performe not the duties of a maister he is but an hypocrite he is no true christian though man accept so of him because he must be obedient to christ both in generall and particular calling now followeth the second argument by which john is described namely the effect that he bare record of the word of god which john bare this record partly by preaching partly by penning the gospell of christ and because the word of god hath two parts the law and the gospell he shewes in the next words that he meanes especially the gospell of christ adding of things done and sayd by christ and lest any man should call his testimonie into question he saith he testifies that whereof he was an eye witnesse he saw it and therefore could not be deceiued and therefore his testimonie was true the end why he alleageth these words is to shew that he is a faithfull pen man of this booke that so it might haue more reuerence for he which was faithfull in penning the gospell of christ the same also is faithfull in penning this prophecie of the church by these words we may gather that to testifie the doctrine of the prophets and apostles to be the truth of god is a true note of a true prophet and by these we may distinguish betweene a true prophet and a false if they bring the doctrine of the apostles and the prophets it is true deut if they worke wonders and their doctrine be to draw man from the true god they are false prophets and must be put to death and our sauiour christ being asked of his authoritie he alledges luke iohns testimonie and confirmeth iohns testimonie to be true asking them this question the baptisme of john was it from heauen or of man shewing that john was a true prophet seeing his baptisme that is his doctrine was from heauen hereby we see the difference of a true prophet and false alledged by the papists is no true difference for they say if one can worke miracles he is a true prophet whereas deut false prophets may do that but the true marke of a true prophet is the doctrine deliuered by the prophets and apostles and he which brings this though he can not worke a miracle is a true prophet now followeth the sixth argument by which this reuelation is described which is in the manner of propounding and deliuering of it to the church and this maner and forme of deliuerie of it stands in foure degrees first god the father giueth it to christ the mediator secondly christ the mediatour and head of the church giueth it to an angell thirdly the angell conueyes it to john the apostle fourthly john directed and assisted by the holie ghost deliuereth it to the churches now as this particular booke was so no doubt all the whole scriptures were conueyed to the church now in that the lord hath so conueyed his scriptures to man we see his perpetuall care and loue of man and of the members of his church also we see the great excellencie and dignitie as also the perfection of these bookes seeing they were deliuered to man by god and by him he deliuers his will to his church this shewes the blasphemie and sin of the church of rome who call the written word of god a dead letter a dumbe iudge they hold that generall councels be equall to the word that the vniuersall consent of the church is aboue the scriptures it giues life and sense to them which otherwise they say of themselues be but an inkie and dumbe word but we see they be farre aboue all these for they be most absolute and perfect and also most excellent seeing they being giuen of god the father to christ the mediator and head of the church and by him conueyed to an angell who deliuers them to john and he published them to the church these degrees of the deliuerie of the shew they be most excellent and perfect blessed are they which heare ampc here is the seuenth and last argument of this description of the reuelation which is by the fruite effect and the profite which comes of it being heard or read and ioyned with marking and attention it brings happinesse blessed that is blessednesse which stands in the fellowship of god and life euerlasting belongs to them which heare and reade this booke and marke it keepe it in memorie remember the things contained in it being a prophecie of the estate of the church partly present partly to come blessed is he which reades here the holy ghost setteth downe the proper end of the scriptures amp of this booke particularly for the ende of this booke and so of all other bookes of the scriptures is to bring man to happinesse and felicitie and life euerlasting ioh last the scriptures be to make vs beleeue in christ that so beleeuing we might haue eternall life ioh he declared to them the word of christ that by it they might haue fellowship with god the father son and holy ghost which fellowship is true happinesse it selfe ioh search the scriptures for in them you thinke to haue eternall life and in this they differ from all other books and writings of man for mens writings being penned either by the light of nature and so be thence erronious and misse of the end of happinesse and euerlasting life or else they be penned by them which haue light by by the word and so as they agree with the word they be grounded on the word and haue all their truth from it seeing the end of this booke as of the other bookes of scripture is to bring man to happinesse we see the opinion and practise of the church of rome is damnable who barre the people of god from reading and hearing the scriptures in their vulgar tongue for in barring them of the meanes they barre them of their saluation the end of them whereas s john would by these wordes blessed ampc drawe man and allure them to to reade and delight in the scriptures seeing the end of this booke and the rest is to bring man to happinesse we are here admonished all of vs to reade and meditate in them and search them as ioh euen as we would search for gold or some precious thing which we would faine finde so the word imports and he addeth the reason for in them you thinke to haue eternall life but some will say i cannot reade i was neuer brought vp in learning s john cuts off this excuse in the next words blessed is he which reades or heares the words of this prophecie so that if he cannot reade yet if he heare and keepe it he is blessed then those which can not reade them they must procure others to reade they must hearken and heare diligently we must learne to carrie in minde the distinction betweene the bookes of god and writings of man god word brings a man which keepes it to happinesse but mans of them selues can not vnlesse they haue light from the word of god and if this distinction were imprinted in our harts we should not be so delighted either to heare or speake the words of god mixed with the words of sinfull man first among the iewes it was not lawful to mingle cloth of diverse kinds then much lesse will the lord suffer his word to be mingled with the sayings of erronious and sinfull man be they neuer so learned or ancient secondly here followeth the right manner and way of hearing and reading the scriptures which stands in two things first we must set downe a certaine end why we reade the scriptures which is that we may attaine to happinesse fellowship with god and life euerlasting and when this takes place that we set downe this end that we reade and heare them with care and conscience to practise them secondly we must keepe the remember the things we reade or heare and this second point is principall to heare and to reade so as we keepe those things we heare or reade and so as we make obseruation of that we heare so the words import here we see the cause why we heare and reade the word dayly yet no profite comes thereby the cause is because we be onely hearers we keepe it not to make vse of it in our liues that we may keepe the word which we heare or reade it is so commended to vs in many places luke mary is said to keepe and to ponder all these things in her heart psalm dauid he hid the statutes of the lord in his heart luke blessed are they which heare the word and keepe it iames we must keepe the word which is grafted in vs where it is compared to a ciens or graffe which is set into a stocke so the word is ingrafted into our hearts and there it must abide and bring forth fruite that we may keepe this word we must first learne the elements of religion in the catechisme both old and young must learne them for that is the beginning of all knowledge and though a man reade and heare the word and yet learne not the grounds he cannot keepe it so that we see the cause why many especially aged folke heare the word from yeare to yeare and neuer profit but are as ignorant as euer they were they be alwayes learning yet neuer learne any thing the reason is because they will not abase themselues to learne those principles of religion those first seed without which they cannot profit by and keepe the word that we may keepe those things we heare or reade we must con our part before we come we must addresse our selues we must not rush on god ordinance without preparation in the old testament when the people offered sacrifice they must sanctifie themselues so we in receiuing of the lord supper we prepare our selues reuerently now that we do in the lord supper we must do in hearing the word seeing there is no difference but that that supper is onely a visible word the word preached is an audible word when the people receiued the law the lord comaunded them to sanctifie themselues three daies before so then when we come to heare the word which is the law expounded we must sanctifie our selues prepare our hearts to heare it this preparation stands in these things we must put out of our hearts all by thoughts all cares and thoughts of worldly affaires and we must set our hearts to seeke the lord ezra to looke in the law that we may know the will of god reuealed in his word withall we must make our carnest prayers to god that he would open our eyes that we may see his will soften our hearts and make our eares attentiue as lidiaes were and also giue vs grace to embrace his word and keepe it when we are about to heare or reade the word we must haue humble hearts else we cannot keepe the word nor beleeue the promises in the same the lord he reueales his secrets to the humble in spirit that is which be humbled for their sinnes troubled and touched with their owne infirmities which haue contite broken and bruised hearts but in the proud heart there is no keeping of the word there is no hole in it for the word to lie in but it is wholly possessed and puffed vp with selfe loue and pride the heart must be an honest heart we must not onely haue our hearts touched with the remembrance of our sinnes but they must be honest hearts good hearts such as are not purposed to liue in sinne or any one sinne be it neuer so litle but wholy purposed to serue the lord we must not come with vnchast or wicked hearts with minds to leaue all sinne but yet to liue in some one sinne we must haue a beleeuing heart heb the old iewes heard the word but it profited them not because they mingled it not with faith in their hearts where he compares them to a vessel in which there must be both the word and faith and these must be mingled together it must be tempered by faith amp then it will be a word of power of life and saluation and this is the onely meanes to remember the word and to beleeue truly the iudgements denounced against sinne and sinners and promises pronounced for the true beleeuers but incredulitie is when we except the curses against sin as not pertaining to vs and cannot apply the promises of the gospell this is the proper cause of all ignorance and obliuion so that we must labour aboue all things for this true faith to beleeue the word and then we shall well and easily remember it we must haue hearing hearts besides these eares of the body we must haue new eares pearced we must haue our eares opened to become listeners and pliable to the word that when the lord cals vs to do his wil we may answer with dauid i am ready to do thy will o god further after we haue read or heard the word we must practise that we heare in performing true repentance and laboring faithfully in our vocation for as we see man of trade become cunning by the continuall practise of their trade so if we practise true obedience in repentance and our vocation we shal be skilfull in the word it followeth which are written in the booke of this prophesie the child of god must keepe and remember the whole word of god yet it is his speciall duty to keepe these prophesies which are to come so the angell bids daniel seale vp the booke of the prophesie till the time come that is remember and keepe it diligently so mathew when they shall see the abhomination of desolation speaking of things to come he would haue them to marke and remember what he saith mat behold i haue told you before where he shewes that when any great things are to befall the church then we must in these be most carefull to remember them for the time is at hand here is a reason of the former words blessed is he which readeth ampc seeing the time of the accomplishing of this prophesie is at hand and must shortly be fulfilled therefore those be blessed which reade and keepe this prophesie and it is an answer to a secret obiection for they might haue said we need not reade this prophesie seeing it shal not be fulfilled in our dayes but he addeth the time is at hand and so taketh that obiection away now seeing these words were in the first verse and here repeated againe he would teach vs that they containe some waighty matter for vs to be considered and to be earnestly thought of now s john addes these words for two causes first because the church though it cannot be ouertaken with deadly sleepe yet it may slumber and be cast into some beginnings of sleepe as the fiue wise virgin though they slept not so carelesly as the other yet they all slept not a deadly sleepe but a slumber for in the church there may be some remnants of security cant the church sleepes but so as she alwayes listens as awaken being in a light slumber now least the church should be carelesse sleeping and drowsie the holy ghost addes these words the time of the last iudgement is at hand secondly he addes these words to confirme the church and all the true members of christ against afflictions seeing by these words he foretels them that they be to last but a short time the time of iudgement is at hand the affliction cannot long endure then this should comfort those which suffer for christ his sake in this that christ foretels the church that now in the last age the time is at hand we must be assured that whatsoeuer befalleth the mebers of christ shal shortly befal them temtations afflictions the crosse and calamity shall presently befall vs the time of iudgement is at hand it will presently befall vs and if we had this confidence that the last iudgement is at hand it would make vs do all in good conscience stay vs fro many sins and the want of this is the cause of much mischiefe for so the bad servant thinking his maister would defer his comming he smites and beates his fellow servant and the old world liued in sinne and would not beleeue the flood should come though they were foretold of it till they were all swept away by water we then should lay this to our harts euer think the lord is at the doore he is presently to come to iudgement and we ought the rather to thinke of this for we haue had ease peace and the gospell flourishing this yeares with all temporall blessings now the state of the church is now peace and now trouble and persecution now then seeing these crosses which must fall on the church they be to be done presently we cannot but looke for affliction and persecution after so long peace and preaching john to the seuen churches in asia grace and peace ampc in this fourth verse is the second part of this chapter which is the inscription of this booke wherein is first the party which writes it and dedicates it secondly the parties to who it is dedicated first the party which dedicates it is john secondly the parties to whom the seuen churches in asia in the inscription are two parts first a dedication secondly a salutation contained from the fourth till the ninth verse in the dedication there be first the party which dedicates it secondly the parties to whom it is dedicated the party which dedicates it is john who here againe in this fourth verse repeates his name yet so as he repeates no more but his bare name without any titles of commendation he repeats it againe to shew and certifie euery reader of this booke that he was without all doubt the true pen man of the holy ghost in writing this reuelation but though he repeate his name yet he doth not adde any titles of honour as he did in the first verse many titles of praise and commendation this he doth to giue vs a true patterne of modesty and humility which is neuer to speake in our own causes to our owne praises but onely in cases of necessity when god glory may be aduanced and the credit of our particular callings maintained this paul practised who often humbles himselfe and cals himselfe the least of all the apostles yes the chiefe of all sinners yet when the credit of his apostleship came into question then he sets out himselfe shewing he was a true apostle and aboue those which did falsly call themselues so corinthian so may we when the glory of god or the credit of our particular callings be in question set out our selues with titles of commendation the persons to whom he wrote were the seuen churches in asia concerning them note two things first he cals them churches secondly in asia why writes he to the churches rather then to the church seeing there is but one true church ans the church may be considered first as it is the whole company of the elect and so it is but one secondly as it is parted and diuersly sundred into parts as in one country there is one church or one part of the church is in one city or towne another part in some other and there may be many churches seeing euery congregation professing the gospell of christ is a church being a member of the true catholicke church as the sea is but one yet there be many parts of the sea which lying against other country are called by their names as the english french spanish italian sea so the particular churches in particular country townes and cities be churches though not the catholicke church but members of it note first the matter of this book concernes the church seeing it is a propheticall history concerning the estate of the church from the time of john to the end and therefore it is meet it should be dedicated to the church secondly it is dedicated to the church seeing the true members of the catholicke church be the pillars and ground of truth not that their authority is aboue the word but because they preserue the scriptures as a treasury from age to age and they be pillars and grounds of truth because they giue testimony to the truth of god word because they publish the truth of god word in and by the ordinary ministery of the word and so the church being the pillar and ground of truth it is fit this booke should be dedicated to it secondly he writes it not to all churches but makes choise of these seuen churches in asia first because they were then most famous as the chapters following and history of the church do shew secondly he sayes not to the churches of ierusalem and of the iewes but of asia to shew them that which was long before foretold was now fulfilled namely that the gentiles according as the prophets foretold should be called which now was verified seeing the gentiles dwelt in asia seeing john wrote and dedicated this booke to the churches in asia many yeares after christ amp not to the church of rome then we see that the papists are deceiued who would haue their church the mother church and all other churches must rely on theirs but if that church of rome had bene the mother and most famous no doubt john would haue dedicated it to her but he doth dedicate it to the churches in asia shewing they were then more famous then rome now followes the salutation grace and peace ampc salutation is of two forts ciuill or religious ciuil as that which man vse ordinarily with one another religious which is more peculiar and proper to the church and so it is here a religious salutation and seeing the apostles vse it commonly in all their epistles may be called an apostolicall salutation they vsed this in all their epistles grace and peace ampc which they did because their ministery was of grace and peace and they made their salutation answerable to their ministery for their apostleship stood in these two to preach the word and to pray for the people that they might haue grace amp peace and the apostles vse this phrase in manner of blessing for when their ministery stood in two actions in preaching and praying for the people vnder the second action of praying was contained this to blesse the people and so did the high priests and leuites as also christ he vsed this so ministers to shew their duty more fully after they preach the word they blesse the people grace be with you most excellent words and containe in them the summe and substance of the whole gospell grace signifies two things first god fauour and good will secondly his graces here it signifies his fauour because in this salutation grace is opposed to peace which is a grace of god so that it cannot be meant of a grace of god then by it is meant his good will and fauour whereby he accepts of vs for christ his sake s john begins with grace first and not with peace because grace is the ground of peace and all blessings amp graces of god we must first be in god fauour then we must looke to haue prosperitie and graces from god grace is the ground of all blessings as of our election vocation redemption iustification sanctification of faith repentance and perseuerance in faith and repentance nay it is all in all in the matter of our saluation for this cause he begins with it and peace peace is taken first for welfare and good successe in things of this world by god blessing exod moses askes iethro his father in law of his peace that is of his welfare and so it is partly taken in this place secondly it is taken for that vnity and blessed concord we shall haue in the kingdome of god and so it is especially taken here and being thus taken it hath sixe parts first when we haue peace with god which is when we stand in the fauour of god reconciled to him in christ iesus secondly when we haue peace with god angels in that they guard vs and cary vs as a nurse doth her child in her armes that we hurt not our feete at any stone and when they reioyce at our good estate psalm the third is peace with a mans selfe when his conscience will not accuse him but excuse and cleare him as when our conscience is washed in the blood of christ philipp this peace passeth all vnderstanding the fourth is peace with the church so act those which beleeued were all of one mind and heart had peace with each other so isaiah the wild beast and the lion the lamb and the cockatrise and the yong child shall lie together fiftly this peace amp fauor of god is with the enemy of god so far as it is for the good of the church and the glory of god so ioseph had peace in pharaohs house so daniel had peace with the kings eunuches for though he was free when the children were cast into the ouen yet he did not reuolt but being fauoured they saued him the sixt is peace with all god creatures beast birds all creatures in heauen and earth ose the lord will make a couenant betweene vs and all his creatures psalm the child of god he shall tread vpon the lion and serpent and they shall not hurt him for when a man is in god fauour what creature dares to hurt him nay al the creatures are ready and willing to serue him grace and peace as though he had said first you must be in the fauour of god you must haue vnity and reconciliation with and in christ and then this peace welfare prosperity in all good things as farre as is necessary yes then concord and vnity with god and all his creatures will follow whereas the apostle wishes them grace in the first place he would teach vs that this god fauour is to be sought for aboue all things yes in the first place psalm many say who will shew vs any good but dauid he seekes this grace and fauour of god lord lift vp the light of thy countenance vpon me let me be in thy fauour and often he sayes the lord he is his portion inheritance and his lot shewing to be in the loue and fauor of god is to be preferred before all things in the world so must we seeke first to be in god fauour make that our chiefest care seeke it aboue all things but we litle practise this because we bring from our cradles naturall presumption which perswades vs that we be in the fauour of god that we haue his loue to vs but we must cast off this naturall presumption and take a new course and the first step to come to grace is to see that we want grace we must see that we be lost sheepe prodigall children in our selues the very fire brands of hell and this to see our owne want of grace is the first step to grace the second step is to desire it when we see that we want it to hunger and long for it thirdly to lay hold on it to apprehend this fauour and grace by true and liuely faith to apply the promises of saluation by faith in christ iesus and this is the last steppe to get this grace secondly in that he sets downe first grace secondly peace here is the true order of seeking for things and blessings in this life first for grace and god fauour secondly for peace and welfare not first peace and welfare but first for grace so christ bids vs first to seeke the kingdome of god and the rigteousnes thereof and then when we are in god kingdome of grace all things needfull shall be ministred to vs this discouers the bad practise of most man who begin at a wrong end first with peace in their callings to get honour riches pleasure or preferment neuer seeking first for grace and god fauour but if we would haue peace we must first haue grace but man if god blesse them in riches health and wealth they say oh god loues me but alas we deceiue our selues for we may haue peace yet want grace we may haue this welfare health wealth libertie and yet want grace nay the peace of the wicked is no blessing but a curse and though the lord giue a man health wealth libertie which be but common blessings he may be out of his grace and fauour seeing the lord bestowes these common blessings on those which be his enemy psalm but though the wicked haue all these common blessings they be accursed and though a man had grace the fauour and true loue of god and had no other health wealth nor libertie yet he were most happy and blessed fro him which is was ampc here he sets down the cause efficient and the author of these two grace and peace the author is god distinguished into three persons the father son and holy ghost the father in these words which is was and is to come the holy ghost is noted in these words and from the seuen spirits which are before his throne thirdly the son in the fift verse s john in the first place describes the father by his true nature in these words which is was and is to come in which he alludes to that exo where moses demaunds of god if the people should aske who sent him what he should answer the lord tels him say i am ehjeh iehouah hath sent me where are two names to one end namely to expresse the nature of god now s john he expounds them here where he saith he which is which was and is to come further these two names ehjeh iehouah be two such names as cannot be translated fully in our english tongue but are more significant in their originall hebrue tongue for they import thus much grace and peace be from him which is in himselfe and from himselfe a most perfect and absolute substance which was and which is to come a most absolute perfect simple substance and essence so that he is a nature most simple pure and subsisting in and by himselfe corinthian an idoll is not so it is nothing in and of it selfe but onely in mans braine it hath no subsisting and being of it selfe by nature but by mans article and thus the lord differs from all false god seeing he hath his being in and from himselfe not of or by any other thing none other hath this propertie but god by this we see the nature of all creatures which is that though they haue their subsisting and being as mans body and soule yet it is not from themselues but from god not taken out of his essence for then they should be god and the lord hath no parts as we haue but he makes all things out of himselfe of nothing seeing then we haue all we haue of god our body soules and all we inioy we must in lieu of recompence in thankfulnesse and obedience giue our selues soules and body to his seruice to do his will and pleasure the lord is most absolute and eternall euery way without beginning or ending angels and the soules of man they be eternall but not as absolutely though they be eternall in that they shall neuer die yet had they a beginning secondly they are eternall not absolutely but by participation for god made them eternall but the lord is most absolutely euery way eternall from him which is to come that is to iudgement to iudge all his creatures especially man and angels that god which is was which hath his being of in and from himself he shall come to iudgement this must we remember and thinke of that he which is god of himselfe and by himselfe which giues vs life and being he shall iudge vs and this will be a meanes to make vs do our dutie in conscience but many man flat themselues saying god will not come in my time to iudgement but though the lord come not to generall iudgement in this life yet he will come in particular iudgement by death in this life thirdly if we would alwayes remember this it would bridle out liues and make vs keepe a good conscience before god and all man act these words commonly are expounded of the angels of god which stand and minister vnto him but it cannot be meant of them for two causes first those which are here called seuen spirits from these grace and peace come but it cannot come from the holy angels which attend to minister before the lord secondly in this verse which is a benediction or a salutation of john to the church the seuen spirits are set before iesus christ the second person of the trinitie which cannot be true of the angels who in no respect can be placed before christ therfore it cannot be vnderstood of the holy angels but for my part i vnderstand it thus and from the seuen spirits ampc that is from the holy ghost this exposition is most agreeable to all the circumstances of the text and the holy ghost is called the seuen spirits first because though he be one in substance yet he is seuen that is many in gifts and operations and for this cause the spirit of god cals himselfe the seuen spirits secondly he cals him so because he sets downe the father son and holy ghost as he saw them in vision now s john saw the holy ghost in forme of seuen lights in a vision reu which are before the throne this he speakes by comparison taken from earthly kings which fitting in their thrones do there shew their might and maiestie most so s john he saw god the father sitting in a throne by vision and christ at his right hand and before the throne the holy ghost hence it followes not that he is inferiour to the father and to the son but by this comparison and kind of speech s john sets out the office of the holy ghost which is to be sent by the father and son to the church to enlighten the members thereof and to sanctifie them seeing that he ascribes grace and peace from god the father and also from the seuen spirits that is the holy ghost hence we note the holy ghost is very god for from whom grace and peace proceeds he is perfect and very god we learne that we may direct our prayers to the holy ghost for to whom grace and peace is ascribed to him we may direct our prayers seeing he can giue grace ampc but they be ascribed to him and he can giue them ergo we may pray to him for them there be some which doubt whether we may pray to the holy ghost but they may aswell doubt whether he be god or not but they say we haue no example ans it is false for here we haue an example for though this grace and peace ampc be a blessing yet in substance it is a prayer as though he had said o father son and holy ghost let thy grace and peace be vpon the church which are before the throne of the father hence we note the holy ghost is a substance and a person subsisting not a quality as some heretikes hold confessing the godhead of the father of the son and denying the godhead of the holy ghost but here we see for the holy ghost he is a substance and person subsisting standing before the throne of the father not a gift or grace proceeding from god but a person distinguished from the father and the son the father he sits on the throne the son is on his right hand the holy ghost distinguished from them both stands before the throne and from iesus christ that is grace and peace from iesus christ where christ iesus is ioyned to the father and the holy ghost in bestowing grace and peace on his church ob why is christ the second person of the trinitie placed after the holy ghost the third person answer for two causes first christ is considered two wayes first as he is the son of the father secondly as he is the mediator of the church now as he is the son of the father he is the second person in trinitie and so before the holy ghost in order secondly as he is mediator and so he is after them both the father and the holy ghost isaiah the spirit of the lord is vpon me hath sent me to preach where christ is sent by the holy ghost to preach as he is mediator and so as he is sent in that respect he is after the holy ghost secondly he is placed after the holy ghost because the maner of them which pen the scriptures is to set them in the last place of whom they meane to speake last so mat he setting downe the genealogie of christ from abraham though in all those there was none more excellent then christ yet he is in the last place because of order the euangelist meaning to speak and treat of him he sets him in the last place purposing still to continue his historie of the life and death of christ so here s john he placed christ in the last place because he purposed to continue his historie in speaking of the death and passion of christ and other things which concerne him now what saith he of christ from this fift till the ninth verse he describes christ first by his offices secondly by the execution of his offices his offices are three first he is set out by his propheticall office in these words which is that faithfull witnesse secondly by his priestly office the first begotten of the dead thirdly by his kingly office and that prince of the kings of the earth first his propheticall office first he is a witnesse secondly a faithfull witnesse thirdly that faithfull witnesse first he is a witnesse isaiah i gaue him to be a witnesse to the nation in that he is called a witnesse there are signified many duties of his propheticall office as first to reueale the will of his father secondly to certifie the church of the certaintie of the same and in these two stand his whole office propheticall first to reueale his fathers will to the church is his office for there is none which knowes his fathers will but he which came from the bosome of the father and he hath declared it ioh and he hath not onely declared his fathers will since he came in the flesh but from the beginning he reuealed the will and word of god when the lord rained fire on sodome gen there iehouah the father rained downe by iehouah the son so when the couenant was made to our first parents it was made in christ the promised seed it was renewed to abraham and the patriarkes from the father by the son as appeared in the bush where iehouah appeared but corinthian there he is called christ the prophets and the apostles wrote as they were inspired by christ they were but his instruments to speake and write that he put into them by the holy ghost the matter and the stile and phrase of the scripture all came from christ nay when any particular man comes to vnderstand the scriptures this is by the working of christ he opens their eyes he gaue the disciples vnderstanding as they went to emaus to vnderstand the scriptures the second duty of christ is to certifie man of his fathers will and that in conscience of the certainty of his fathers will this certification is generall or particular when he certifieth man that the word written or spoken by man out of the word is the word of god neither nature nor learning can do this but it is proper to christs propheticall office and for this he saith to his disciples he will send them the comforter which shall leade them into all truth here we must know first by what meanes he assureth vs secondly the principall cause of this assurance the meanes is the word it selfe the principall cause is the operation of the holy ghost by this three points are resolued first the papists aske how a man can come to know that the scriptures read and taught be the word of god answer we must here haue recourse to the word and to the faithfull witnesse and desire of him his spirit and so we shall be able to discerne and iudge of it for no naturall man can do it no naturall man can discerne the things of god but he which is enlightened by the spirit of god he can secondly a man must haue christ his testimonie of scripture which is the scriptures themselues for in them he setteth downe this testimonie of the scriptures but if christs testimonie be set downe of the scriptures why do not all man know it vnlesse a man haue a natural facultie of seeing he cannot discerne the sun though it shine so vnlesse a man haue grace from christ to iudge of the scriptures he cannot iudge of the but if any haue the spirit of discerning then if he read and mark the phrase and manner of writing the stile and authoritie of the scriptures he shall see then in euery line a testimonie of them giuen by christ how can a man know the true religion seeing the turke papist iew amp protestant haue their religions and dye in them i answer for to know which is true of these we must haue recourse to the faithful witnesse christ and what he saith is true religion that we must hold for true religion now christ he giueth testimonie of them in the scriptures and the scriptures be as a letter sent from heauen to the church shewing and testifiing which is true religion not that of the iew turke or papist but of the christian sundry man hold diverse opinion in matters of religion as the iew turke papist amp christian which is the true opinion how is it knowne answer still we must haue recourse to the witnesse of truth the faithful witnesse and prophet of the church and he is the iudge of these cotrouersies now in the scriptures if we marke them we shall see his iudgement which of these is true but if there be diverse opinions of scriptures what must be iudge in this diuersitie of opinions yes of the scriptures theselues we must still haue recourse to the scriptures amp if we note the circumstances the manner of writing if we conferre scripture with scripture we shall easily find out the true sense and meaning for the lord sets out in them his iudgment plainly and fully the second certificate is particular belonging to the propheticall office of christ which is to certifie man in particular that the promise of the gospell belongs to them as to peter john ampc that he is the child of god and that euerlasting life belongs to any child in particular and this is done especially by the word not read but preached being ioyned with the working of the spirit rom we haue the spirit of christ which testifies with our spirit we be the sonnes of god now if this be the dutie of christ to certifie man in particular that euerlasting life belongs to me or to any particular man then their doctrine is damnable who deny this seeing it is the proper office of the propheticall office of christ and in this he differs from al other prophets and apostles which be witnesses for they can witnesse onely outwardly to the eare but he can speake and testifie to the conscience neither can any of them certifie any man particularly though their ministerie tend to that end christ is not onely a witnesse but a faithfull witnesse first because he testifies not his owne will but his which sent him namely his fathers secondly he testifies all his fathers will neither adding nor detracting from it thirdly because he teacheth it as he receiued it sincerely in the same manner in which he receiued it not altering changing or deprauing his fathers will that faithfull witnesse the lord hath sundrie faithfull witnesses as the prophets apostles the church nay the sun and moone psalm verse but christ alone is that faithfull witnes whereby he is distinguished from all other witnesses for he is aboue all other his witnesse is authenticall sufficient of it selfe amp needs no confirmation the witnes of the apostles and prophets be not authenticall and certaine but as they consent with christs witnesse secondly he is that witnesse because he is the lord of that house whereof he giues witnesse namely the church but the apostles and prophets are but servant thirdly christ his witnesse is inward it assures and speakes to the conscience but the witnes of man as of the prophets and apostles is outward onely it comes to the eares it neuer binds and assures the conscience so that for that prerogatiue he is aboue all witnesses and here called that faithfull witnesse whereas christ the doctor and prophet of the church is called a faithfull witnesse we learne that all ministers must be faithfull witnesses for euery minister of the gospell when he preacheth out of god word he is in the roome of christ speaketh that which christ should speake therefore he must be like christ a faithfull witnesse now that they may be faithful witnesses they must deliuer the testimony of christ aboue all other things and before all testimonies of man in the office of their ministery so it was meate and drinke to christ to teach his fathers will so abraham his eldest servant shewed his fidelitie in that he would not eate or drinke till he had done his maisters message gen so the ministers must haue care first to teach the wil of god aboue all things secondly they must testifie all the will of god concerning matters of saluatio as among man we count him a faithful witnes which testifies all the truth and no more but the truth so they be faithfull ministers which testifie the whole will of god in things belonging to saluation neither adding nor detracting so paul cleared himselfe that he was free from all mens blood seeing he deliuered the whole will of god in matters necessary for saluation and kept nothing backe he must neither adde nor take away much lesse in any case depraue the word of god and this is the true marke of a faithfull witnesse in the church of rome a man may heare things concerning morall vertues handled soundly but come to faith and repentance matters of saluation they take away one part and adde another to the scriptures they hold the creed in word yet in deede they deny the same as by their doctrine it will appeare the true witnesse must deliuer the testimony of christ in that manner he receiues it namely in a spirituall manner in a plaine easie manner in a familiar kind of speech that the conscience of euery hearer may be moued when we seeke to obscure the word we do corrupt the same and as trade man and huxters we cannot be content to declare the word in a plaine easie familiar speech but as they set out their wares with sterching blowing spicing ampc so we set a gloze on the word and make merchandize of it corinthian this is a common sinne in this age for we teach the word but in an humane manner man speake and preach the word but onely to shew their owne wit learning reading and gifts but he which deliuereth not the word in that maner he ought and wherein he receiues it he is a false witnesse christ he is a faithfull witnesse and that faithfull witnesse then we see the damnable practise of most man now adayes for they heare the word continually preached and reade the same yet the prophet cryes out who hath beleeued our sayings none feare the threatnings of the law none beleeue the promises of the gospell what an heauie and horrible thing is this that we should not beleeue the promises of saluation nor feare the threats of the law for our sins seeing it is the doctrine preached and confirmed by the testimonie of christ iesus the true and faithfull witnesse of the fathers will to man this is to make christ a lyer to make him a false prophet and giue him the lye by the consideration of this that christ iesus is the faithful witnesse that the doctrine deliuered out of his word is confirmed by his testimonie must we take heed that we feare and treble at the threates of the law that we beleeue assuredly the promises of the gospell for they which will not beleeue haue their portion in the lake of fire and brimstone revelation againe seeing christ jesus is that faithfull witnesse which giueth testimonie to mens cosciences in particular of their saluation this teacheth vs to beleeue the promises of the gospell that they belong to each of vs in particular as to john peter ampc and euery true member of christ for he is the true and faithfull witnesse he alone giueth testimonie to mens consciences now though it be against all sense yet we must beleeue him seeing he is true and if we do not we make him a false witnes giuing him the lye then it is no presumption as the papists say to beleeue our election and saluation in particular nay it is an horrible sinne not to beleeue it seeing christ a most faithfull witnesse testifies the same to our consciences by his holy spirit nay for this end to perswade euery man in particular he appointed his sacraments bread and wine in the supper and water in baptisme that euery one might particularly receiue the amp particularly be assured of the same for in that he offers them he doth as if he should say i offer you in them life euerlasting then to doubt of this that we may assuredly perswade our selues in particular of our owne saluation is to call into question whether christ be a true witnesse a true and faithfull prophet or not and the first begotten of the dead here in these words is contained the second office of christ namely his priestly office the first begotten of the dead he alludeth in these words to the estate of the families among the iewes for as among them he which was first borne and eldest of the familie had many priuiledges and preheminences as of the lordshippe of the priesthood of double portion ampc so christ which is compared to the eldest and first borne he hath his priuiledges yes euen christ crucified he hath his prerogatiues among the dead aboue all that are dead so paule calleth him the first and beginning of the dead and after expounds it that he might in all things haue the preheminence colos the second priuiledge is that christ being dead was the first which rose from death to life for none rose from death to life before him ob lazarus moses amp elijah in the mount they had their body restored the againe yes lazarus rose to life againe before christ answer moses and elijah receiued their body againe lazarus also liued againe but these returned againe to their former miserie as lazarus he rose from death to die againe so moses and elijah tooke to them their body againe not to enter into eternall happinesse but to their former miserie but christ he rose from death to eternall happinesse and rose not to die any more but his resurrection is the first steppe to eternal life and felicitie the second priuiledge which he hath aboue all the dead is that he by his owne power and by the vertue of his godhead raised his manhood but all that rise to life saue christ they are raised by vertue of his resurrection not by their owne power none can raise themselues but by the vertue of that mysticall vnion betweene christ the head and vs the members for as the first fruites being offered to the lord they sanctified all the rest so christ iesus the first fruites of the dead did by his resurrection sanctifie and make acceptable all our resurrections in this is a notable comfort for all god children against the immoderate feare of death for if john had said christ is the first borne among the liuing it had bene a great comfort for then had he shewed that we be his familie on earth that the company of his children on earth is his familie and he is the head of them he our elder brother but in that he saith the first begotten of the dead here is an excellent comfort for the lord sheweth thereby that he hath speciall regard euen of the dead of his familie for the company of his members which be dead they be his familie and in this familie christ is numbred as the elder brother and in that respect he hath a double right first of a king secondly of a priest of a king in making the dead to obey his voyce and to rise from the dead at his comaundement secondly of a priest to offer himselfe an acceptable sacrifice to his father and also by his death to sanctifie and perfume the death of the godly so that their death is to them no death for as the first fruites sanctified the rest of the corne so christ the first fruits of the dead he sanctifieth the death of al his children so that death sanctified by his death is no curse to the godly the graue is not a prison but a pleasant chamber of rest and prince of the kings of the earth here is the third namely the kingly office of our sauiour christ he is called a prince of the kings of the earth in two respects first as he is god the son of god and so king together with the father and the holy ghost gouerning all things by his diuine power being equall to them secondly as he is mediator as he is god and man in two natures he is called a prince of kings so mat all power is giuen me of the father not as he is god but as he is god and man the mediator or godincarnate so the lord gaue him a name at which euery knee shold bow euen as he is mediator and of these two i take it he meaneth the second sense here where he cals christ a prince of the kings of the earth in regard as he is god and man or god incarnate the mediator now christ being a king he must needes haue a kingdome which cannot stand in the might and pollicie of man as earthly kingdomes do but it is spirituall it stands in the heart and consciences of man his lawes they bind the soule and conscience to obedience and this is his priuiledge which can be giuen to no creature man or angell to rule and raigne spiritually in the heart and conscience this spirituall kingdome of christ is exercised in the consciences and soules of man by the word of christ not by dint of sword or force of armes but he is a king which carieth his sword in his mouth euen his word by which he rules and raigns in our hearts he rules with the rod of his mouth isaiah that is by his word by which he speaketh to mens consciences prince of the kings of the earth so is christ in two respects first because he and he alone can and is able to giue lawes to bind the consciences of man yes of the greatest monarch in the world none so high which is not subiect to his lawes secondly he is called king of the princes of the earth because he hath soueraigne power ouer all kings and potentates to saue and to destroy for not onely hath he power to make a law to bind their consciences but also if they keepe it to saue them if they breake his law he hath power to destroy them be they what they may be he hath the key of heauen to open and to shut none can controle him revelation he can if he will leade them to life and saue them or else leaue them to their owne mind and so destroy them seeing our sauior christ is a prince of the greatest monarks of the world and is farre aboue them we must then with all feare amp trembling reuerence his high maiestie we reuerence kings on earth shewing great dutifulnesse to them then what reuerence ow we to him which is prince and lord of all the kings of the earth we cannot conceiue what reuerence we owe vnto him which is placed in the throne of all maiestie we must shew our reuerence to this prince by hearing his word with trembling and beleeuing hearts reuerently and with conscience we must not dare to take his high name into our mouthes without great reuerence the very kings must shew reuerence vnto this king of kings but the common practise of man doth shew what litle reuerence we haue of christ for we haue his name in our mouthes at euery word to prophane the same to talke of it in iesting and without all reuerence we tosse it in our mouthes like a tenice ball seeing he is king of kings we must giue him absolute obedience princes must be obeyed so farre as they obey him but he must be obeyed without exception absolutely and not onely absolutely but willingly must he be obeyed and without compulsion freely yes personally perpetually and in all his commaundements man they will say they beleeue in christ as he is their sauiour but that is not enough we must beleeue in him as he is the king of princes that we therefore may beleeue in him as he is king of kings we must do him absolute obedience do his will in all things and vnlesse we beleeue in him so we cannot beleeue in him no not as he is a sauior for these two go together now this duty and obedience we owe to him must be done to him as we learne out of his word read and preached in the church seeing he is king of kings al princes kings amp potetates must do him seruice for they be all inferiour and subiect to him psalm the three last verses be wise now o ye kings be learned ye iudges of the earth kisse the son ampc that is inwardly reuerence and outwardly obey him this their subiection must be shewed to christ their king in the gouernement of their kingdomes for they must make and frame their lawes after the lawes of christ iesus they must make lawes exercise iudgement keepe courts assises begin and end and continue war by his commaundements and seeing all kings are in subiection to christ as their subiects be to them they must therefore be guided and directed in all the matters of their kingdomes by the counsell of christ so dauid saith thy lawes o lord are my counsellers psalm if christ be soueraigne king and aboue all other kings then all other must plant and set vp in their kingdomes the religion of christ else how can they shew they be christs subiects then it followes that they may not be of what religion they list and this is shewed in the parable of the mariage for when the supper was ready he sent his servant to compell them to his supper which may be vnderstood of the magistrate whose duty is to compell man to the true religion and profession of the gospell of christ seeing christ is king of kings and no man hath this priuiledge but he hence we learne that kings on earth they in their dominions are soueraigne kings ouer all persons amp causes because as he is king of kings absolutely so they are vnder him kings and haue supremacy in their kingdomes then we see the presumption and arrogancy of the pope and sea of rome who would be supreame head of the whole earth and king of all kings to put christ out of his office and sit in his roome ouer al at his pleasure seeing christ is king of all kings we must not be discouraged when we be called to suffer any affliction or crosse seeing that though the tyrants and kings of the earth rage and bend their force to hurt vs yet we haue a king aboue them all who can stay and bridle them and if he please confound and bruise them in peeces they cannot do any thing but that which he permits them to do for he rules and raignes in the midst of all these where they are the thickest and would do most malice and can do to them as pleaseth him now followes the second part of christs description by his execution of his offices which consist in foure workes the first contained in these words vnto him which loued vs the second in these which washed vs in his bloud the other two in the two last verses which follow which loued vs that is the churches of asia and by proportion all other churches being parts of the true church the loue of christ hath three degrees the first is called a generall loue whereby he loues all his creatures as they be his creatures and this loue is common to all his creatures the second degree is the loue of mankind in that he was content to become a redeemer for mankind not for any other creature no not for the angels which fell as well as man the third degree which is most principall is that whereby he loues his elect and chosen children which is that loue whereby he accepts of them to life euerlasting this third degree hath two parts for it is taken first for the purpose of his decree to loue secondly for the action or declaration of his loue for the first as i haue loued iacob and hated esau that is i haue purposed to loue the one and hate the other secondly for the declaration of his purpose to loue thirdly for the action and for the declaration of his loue and speciall fauor in speciall benefits ioh behold what singular loue god hath shewed on vs nothing the declaration of his purpose to loue vs in giuing his son for vs so in this verse is meant god special loue or the declaration of his purpose to loue vs in speciall benefits now whereas s john placeth this in the first place of all the benefites of christ that he loued vs he would teach vs that this loue is the very ground of mans redemption the very cause of god liking and fauor to man then there is no foreseene faith away with foreseene workes for he loued vs first and that alone is the cause and ground of our election and saluation but it may be obiected the loue of god as also of man respects the goodnesse of things loued so we loue a thing because it is good and when it is euill we hate it there is great difference betweene the loue of the creature and the creator the creature loues the thing because he seeth it is good but god the creator he first loues the creature and hence it comes that it is good because he loues it whereas s john and all the churches of asia as other true churches do beleeue and are assured that christ loues them for that s john taketh for graunted this should moue all man to haue this care to labour aboue all things to be rooted and grounded in loue seeing he places that in the first place this we do when we are assured in heart and conscience by the working of god spirit that he loues vs in christ so that he which takes away the assurance of god loue to vs in christ takes away the very ground of our saluation now that we may haue this loue of god we must in all our duties to god and man draw neare to god keeping a good conscience before god amp all man and so if we loue god he wil come to vs stay and dwell in vs and if we would haue his loue to be plentifully shed in our hearts then we must draw neare to him by loue and he will draw neare to vs for he louing vs first if we increase in that loue to him then will he double his loue to vs and washed vs from our sinnes in his blood here is the second benefit and action of christ to his church which is first the remission of sinnes secondly the mortification of sinnes washed here he sheweth that the sinnes of man are as filthy spots in their soules and after he confesseth the vile estate of the church and euery member thereof in that he saith they were so washed for washing presupposeth filthinesse before and a corrupted estate and so should we by their example learne to consider our owne estate how that our soules and body be spotted and defiled with sins originall and actuall so did dauid psalm most sensibly and excellently feele his owne wants and see his miserable estate when he desired the lord to wash him thorowly confessing thereby his soule and body was foule stained and polluted with sinne and addes thoroughly not once and so inough bnt wash me againe and againe thoroughly till i be cleane and cleanse me rince bathe swill me in the blood of christ to be purged and cleansed from all my sinnes in which words he sheweth his exceeding feeling of his own miseries how fouly he was defiled so should we labour to see how the spots of sinne are deeply stucke in our soules they be fast set so that one washing will not serue but we must be rinced bathed and cleansed by the blood of christ for it is not the hand of any man or angell which can wash away these spots nor any thing they can giue vs but onely christ iesus whose finger alone dipped in his owne blood can wash away our spots of sinne the consideration whereof should make vs consider our wretched estate and often to repent vs of our sins to take heed of sin which staines vs so we must labour to haue our hearts purged and cleansed by the blood of christ and till we haue them so purged neither our faith obedience loue or any thing we do is acceptable to god the first part of this benefit of christ containes the remission of our sinnes the taking away of the punishment and the guilt due to them the second part is the mortification of sin which hath washed vs from all ampc he addeth these words to shew that if any beleeue truly he hath pardon of all his sinnes without any restraint or limitation of these or those sinnes by his blood how can blood wash away filthinesse nay it rather defiles a man answer this washing stands not in the substance of the blood but in the merit thereof for the blood of christ shed is lost and god knowes what is become of it whatsoeuer the papists say but the merite of it washeth away sinnes obiect but why doth christs blood rather then any other mans blood as peter john ampc answer because that blood was the blood of god not of the godhead but of him who was both god and man for these two natures being vnited together make but one person and so it may be called the blood of god as paul saith god redeemed vs by his blood that is christ god and man god man or god incarnate and so it being the blood of god is more meritorious then the blood of any creature whatsoeuer besides i answer christ was appointed by god to be a publike person to be suretie for all mankind but no man can be so to be in the roome of the whole company of makind then damnable is the doctrine of the papists who hold the blood of martyrs can merit for other for seeing they be but priuate man they cannot profit any other by blood we must vnderstand the passion of christ being a part for the whole and withall we must remember his fulfilling of the law for in his suffering he fulfilled the whole law and in fulfilling the law he suffered and these two cannot be seuered so that this containes the whole obedience of christ partly in suffering partly in fulfilling the law s john addeth these words and sets downe these two blessings to draw man to loue and like this booke to make them reade and take delight in it now all of vs will say god loues me and hath pardoned my sins in christ then we should shew our loue againe to him in taking delight in hearing and reading the word of god set downe in this or any other booke of scripture and if we perswade our selues god hath loued vs we must then offer vp to him in signe of loue againe our selues soules and body to serue him to do him obedience rom in regard of recompence to his mercies and loue shed out and shewed vnto vs and made vs kings and priests to god and his father euen his father in these words is set downe the third action worke and benefite of christ bestowed on his church he hath made euery true member of it a king and a priest better to vnderstand these words we must consider in them foure points first the dignitie and excellency of all true beleeuers and members of christ kings and priests secondly when they be made namely hath made speaking in the time past noting that true beleeuers are kings and priests thirdly the maner how we are not created such neither borne to be such but he hath made vs such fourthly to whom to god euen the father first our dignitie and the excellencie of all true beleeuers and members of christ hath two heads first kings secondly priests they are called kings not in regard of an earthly kingdome for the condition of most beleeuers on earth is base but in regard of a spirituall kingdome and in respect of the kingdome of heauen for the lord he giues them this title and interest to be kings to haue right to the kingdome of heauen in christ so our sauiour christ speakes to his disciples feare not litle flock it is your fathers pleasure to giue you the kingdome the members of christ are said to haue interest and title to the kingdome of heauen in these respects first because by christ they be lord and conquerors of all these enemy sin satan the world death hell and our owne flesh secondly because in and by christ they are partakers of the kingdome of heauen they haue interest into it and right to the kingdome of happinesse for they receiue of christ grace for grace glory for glory felicitie and happinesse for glory happinesse and felicitie thirdly because they be made lord of all creatures except good angels and the church corinthian god is all in all to them all things are theirs they god and we haue interest to all his creatures in heauen and earth by christ ob but if christ be king and al his mebers how do they differ answer in two points first christ he is the son of god by nature therefore a king by nature and so his inheritance belongs to him by nature but the members of christ are the sonnes of god by adoption in his son so that our right to that kingdome is not by nature but by adoption secondly christ he is king ouer all creatures whatsoeuer ouer the angels and the church and he is absolute king ouer all and hath his regiment in the hearts and consciences of man and can by his word bind them but his members they be not vniuersall kings for they haue not superioritie aboue good angels and the church neither are they absolute kings as he is neither by themselues but by christ iesus and as they participate with christ in his kingdome the second part of our dignitie stands in this that we be priests in that we be consecrated and set apart by christ to the worship and seruice of god here in this life to serue him in spirit and truth and in the life to come eternally to serue and praise him christ he is priest so are we but yet there is difference first christ he is an externall and reall priest of the new testament which offers vp a true reall and externall sacrifice to god the father for vs we are not reall and externall priests but spirituall offer vp spirituall sacrifice and christ hath this priuiledge to offer vp a reall corporall and substantial sacrifice in the new testament we do not so when any member of christ giues an almes he offers a sacrifice to god not a corporall sacrifice but spirituall euery way againe note this that our sauiour christ he is a perfect priest and offers vp a perfect sacrifice but we being imperfect do offer vp an imperfect sacrifice tainted and blemished with sinne but accepted as perfect for the worthinesse of christs sacrifice secondly we be kings and prists in this life for as in the entrance into an earthly kingdome there be degrees as first to giue one title to it secondly to giue him possession of it which is more then to giue one title onely so god children they haue the right giuen them of the kingdome of heauen in this life and as in the giuing of possession of a kingdome there be two degrees first the beginning of the possession secondly the full enioying and perfect possessio so we haue the beginning of the possession of the kingdome of heauen in this life which stands in righteousnesse ioy and peace and they which haue these haue the kingdome of god begun in them the second part and degree is after this life which is the full fruition and possession of the kingdome of heauen but in all the true members of christ it is begunne here and accomplished there and as we be kings in this world so we must be priestes too in offer spirituall sacrifice to god and dedicating and consecrating our selues to his seruice hath made vs true beleeuers be kings and priests not by nature neither borne such nor by creation or birth or bloud are they such or by any other priuiledge they haue fro ma how then as earthly kings and priests were made in the old testament so are spirituall kings and priests in the new the king was elected and ordained by a solemne calling so the priest by a solemne election so are the kings and priests which be spirituall by a diuine calling in which calling note two things first christ giueth his members right to his owne kingdome to be kings and priests yet not so that they can execute the regiment sustained by christ and do the office of a king and priest as it is done by christ but because they belong to them in part and they haue the benefite of them both redounding to them wholly and this right they haue is brought to passe in the couenant of grace for the lord in it promiseth that he for his part will giue to the true beleeuers in christ iesus his son with all his benefits as he giues them this to be kings and priests for euery thing which belogs to christ as he is head of the church belongs to his servant as members and he imparts it to them in some sort secondly in the appointing of kings they must be annointed so must we be annointed psalm christ was annointed aboue his fellowes but yet his members they are also annointed he in greater measure his members in lesse measure yet by the same oyle with him which is the vnction of the holy ghost we haue receiued the annointing of christ john and the lord he bids the wicked not to touch his annointed meaning not onely his servant abraham isaac and the patriarkes but his true members we haue the same spirit christ had in his manhood though not in the same measure and the lord he giues vs these gifts of the spirit signified by this oyle to this end that we may be fit kings amp priests so that first he giues vs right to a kingdome and then he giues vs gifts to discharge our dutie to whom hath he made vs kings and priests to god and the father euen his father now man might haue said if all his members be kings then all may liue as they list but he addeth they be kings but to god shewing that the interest they haue giuen to them to the kingdome of heauen it is giuen the that they may be kings and priests to god glorie to his worship and seruice and to shew that all the interest belongs to god absolutely to vs by him in christ lastly he addeth god and his father which expounds the former word god for it is not taken for his nature absolutely but for the first person god euen his father which sheweth that they must not liue as they list for they be made kings to the honour and seruice of god the father who is here named alone not because he is aboue the son and holy ghost for they be equall but because he is the first person in order and the fountaine of the deitie from it it is deriued to the son and holy ghost now after the meaning of the words followe the vses first whereas all the true members of christ be kings and priests in this life we are taught how we must carie our selues namely as enemy to them which be of the kingdome of satan sinne the world and the flesh we must be deadly and sworne enemy to them we must haue no concord nor amitie with them for if we be kings of the kingdome of grace then we must be enemy to them which belong to the kingdome of darknesse there must be no fellowship between light and darknesse now that we may so carie our selues as enemy we must first haue care to keepe guard to defend our selues as kings against all our enemy sinne satan our owne flesh and the inticements of the world as kings protect their kingdomes so must we stand on our guard defend our soules and body and euery facultie and part of them our wils affections thoughts and inclinations ioh he which is borne of god keepeth himselfe as with watch and ward that sinne or satan touch him not we must make war and enter combat against satan sinne our owne flesh all our spirituall enemy the corruptions of our nature and all the inticements of the world we must make no truce with them because they will neuer be reconciled so long as we haue interest into the kingdome of heauen we must labour to kill and destroy these our enemy as much as possibly we can by that power we haue from christ our head we must kill and crucifie the corruption of our owne hearts that is our owne sinnes we must like a valiant king seeke to haue the bloud of these enemy and seeke to conquer and vanquish satan his power and might the world and our owne corruption if we be kings in this life we must become lord and rule ouer our selues our soules and body must be brought into subiection and order for in this that we be kings of our selues we shew especially that we be kings in this life we must not haue rule of the whole world but be ruling and maistering our owne corruptions and affections bringing them into subiection and order herein stands our kingdome in this world if a man were prince ouer the whole earth and yet could not rule himselfe he were but a poore prince nay he were no prince indeed but though a man had not so much as a foote of ground in this world and could rule and maister himselfe his thoughts and affections this man were a valiant king seeing we be kings we must do the duty of iudges for kings they be as absolute iudges and they must execute iudgement in the day of iudgement we shall be iudges but we must be iudges in this world and we must not iudge other man but we must be our owne iudges wherefore as iudges summon arraigne condemne ampc so must we summon and arraigne yes iudge and examine our selues call our selues to account and as guilty persons condemne our selues acknowledging we be worthy to be cast into eternal damnation with the diuell and his angels and withall pleade for pardon approch to the throne of grace and forgiuenesse and in these we shew our selues vpright iudges and and by this meanes we shall be freed from the iudgement to come if we be kings by christ we must cary our selues as kings couragiously amp constantly in the afflictions and miseries which we shall suffer for christs sake for herein stands the royalty of a king that he beares couragiously and constantly all the troubles which befall him so must we in the afflictions and troubles of this life which we suffer for christ shew our selues in suffering them to be kings and conquerors seeing we be spirituall kings we must aboue all things labor and seek to haue that our right and heritance to be possessors of our kingdome must we so then we must not haue our hearts glued and fast tied to the things of this world but we must so vse this world as though we vsed it not if a king should lay downe his crowne and go and become a shepheard or of some manuall trade all man would maruell at it so when we fasten our selues to these worldly things we do as it were cast aside our kingly crowne and abase our selues but we must euer haue one foote fixed in heauen striuing to come to our inheritance there seeing all the true members of christ be kings and priests this should be an inducement to all backward persons to moue them and stirre them forward to christian religion and not to account of it as precisenesse seeing that by it we come to haue right and interest to the kingdome of heauen to be lord of all creatures for why should we not esteeme of the gospell as a most precious iewell seeing that we which are vassalles of satan and fire brands of hell as all man are by nature become the members of christ yes kings and priests to god and seeing this is effected by the ministery of the gospel this should moue vs to embrace it to loue and like it seeing it brings vs such an excellent benefit and not to misname it as we do by reprochfull termes yes verily the consideration of this should make the ministers of the word to take all paines to preach the word seeing by it they make man to become of vassalles of satan the true members of christ and heires of the kingdome of heauen in this world for a man to consecrate and establish one in a kingdome it is a thing of great honour is it not of greater honour to consecrate one to become king of heauen and earth to be heire of the kingdome of heauen now that this is done in the ministery of the gospel when by the word preached we are conuerted made to beleeue in christ and to repent of our sinnes this i say should stirre and pricke forward the ministers of the word to labour to win man to christ and to make them kings and priests to god his father there also is matter of comfort to the godly for seeing they be kings and priestes in the kingdome of christ if a man be in the crosse and affliction which is a great griefe yet let him know to his comfort that though he be so handled amp it appeareth not what he shal be yet he is a king and that he shall be and is heire to the kingdome of heauen if a man be in sicknesse he must consider it is but god messenger to call him out of this world to the possession of a kingdome if a man be in the trouble and vexation of mind and of his owne conscience if he be tormented fearefully with his sins yet he must be content the lord wil giue him a happy issue he must know he is a king and therefore shall one day haue conquest ouer sin satan and his owne corruption yes ouer all his enemy whatsoeuer if a man be in the heat of persecution so that he is turmoiled and tossed from post to pillar then flesh and blood cannot brooke it yet he is a king though he in persecution be killed and put to death euen then let him consider he is a most valiant conquerour rom in the pang of death when nature must needs be dissolued and soule and body separated then we must remember that we be kings in christ and so we shall not feare death but know it is but a way and easie passage to the ful possession of our kingdom thus much in that we are kings in that all the members of christ be priests not earthly but spiritual and offer to god spirituall sacrifices first we are hence bound by this our calling to teach and instruct one another for the office of the priest in the old testament was to instruct the people the priests lips must keepe knowledge mal so must we be teachers of others column we all ought to be able to teach the will of god that so the gospell of christ may be spread abroad and as this belongs to al man so especially to gouernors they must especially shew themselues priests to their charges abraham did it gen dauid did it pro and bathshebath did it prouer and all must do it that desire an holy generation to succeed after them we teach other things why not religion seeing we be priests we must pray for others not onely for our selues but for all man especially the members of christ the priest in the old testament must pray and make request not onely for himselfe alone but for the people also moses is commended for prayer especially when he prayed for the israelites and stood before the lord in the gap exod eliah is called the horseman and chariots of israel and hezechiah beseecheth the lord to be good to his people and so when any man in the word is comended for prayer it is for that he prayed for the people so did dauid in the psalmes so did christ make this his speciall duty john we must offer spirituall sacrifice to god that is dedicate our selues our soules and body and all that is in vs our wit learning knowledge or any gift of body or mind we must consecrate it to god seruice that we may do all this to his glory we must look that all we take in hand be begun in faith do proceed from a good heart and be directed to a good end to god glory principally and if we do it in faith and obedience then it will please him we must be ful of blessings we may haue nothing to do with cursed speaking as the priests in the old testament their duty was to blesse the people so we must speake nothing but blessed and gracious speeches take heed of all cursed speaking of swearing and forswearing we must be blessed and gracious speakers to all man friend fo or any we must haue god our portion for the leuites had no portion in the land of canaan but dwelt in tents and the lord was their portion so we being priests to god we must be content with any estate in this world for god is our portion we must not seeke too much to haue any inheritance on earth for god fauour in christ that is our portion and this wil suffice to him be glory in these words is a praising and thanksgiuing to god for the three former benefits of christ bestowed on the church in that s john before he come to the end of his description of christ should interrtupt himselfe to giue god thankes for his benefits we see that the consideration of god benefits bestowed on vs should be a meanes to stirre vs vp to praise the lord we should be caried away with this affection of thanksgiuing as s john was and in these words of this holy man we do see what is the true forme of giuing thankes to god namely to giue him and ascribe to him all glory power and absolute dominion for euermore but alas it is too too manifest that mans corrupt nature will not do this but denieth it and taking this from god bestoweth it on creatures yes on our own selues and it is a matter of grace to know this and to confesse that all glory and dominion belongs to god and to giue him his due so christ he teacheth vs to ascribe all power glory might and dominion to god when we say in the lord prayer for thine is the kingdome power and glory that is it is due to thee o lord not to any creature whatsoeuer amen so be it let it be so that thou mayst haue all glory and dominion he addes this to shew his feruent desire of god glorie and therefore he doubles and repeates it for he had said that before but not content with it he sheweth his feruencie and repeates the same againe so should we not freeze or be cold in our desire of god glorie but be feruent and earnest doubling and repeating the same behold he comes in the cloudes ampc in the fifth and sixth verses are contained a large description of christ partly by his offices partly by the execution of his offices which are these first he is a faithfull witnesse secondly he is the first begotten of the dead thirdly he is prince of the kings of the earth secondly the execution of his offices which stands in fou e actions first he loueth the church secondly he washeth away the spots of it in his bloud thirdly made vs kings and priests to god the father and of these three actions in the former verses the fourth action is his second comming to iudgement to iudge both quicke and dead in this seuenth verse is a narration or large declaration of the second coming of christ to iudgement in the words consider first this note of attention behold secondly s john propounds christ his coming it self thirdly the maner of it in the cloudes and that is amplified that it shall be open euery eye shall see it fourthly the effect of his coming all tribes of the earth shall waile s john concludes it with two notes of asseueration euen so amen to confirme the second coming of christ to all people behold first s john he beginneth with a note of attention behold the spirit of god is accustomed when any thing especially is worth our marking to prefixe before it this note of attention behold or such like then this teacheth vs one speciall dutie which is often and euery day earnestly and seriously to consider of the second coming of christ to iudgement the which consideration is a speciall meanes to beginne and to continue the conuersion of a sinner so mat when the scribes and pharisees obstinate enemy came to the baptisme of s john he vseth this as a meanes to make them to turne and beleeue in christ saying o generation of vipers who hath forewarned you that you should flie from the vengeance to come so act peter vseth this argument to bring the iewes to repentance because the day of refreshing is at hand act paul perswades the athenians to repentance because there is a day of iudgement appointed ampc now all these are to winne man to repentance by the consideration of this one point euen the day of iudgement and this makes john to say behold secondly this word may serue to strike our hearts with a feare and reuerence of christ when we consider that he shall come to iudgement so often as we consider of his coming so often we should haue our hearts liuely touched with awe and reuerence to him we stand in awe and reuerence to magistrates when we consider that they haue authoritie to attach apprehend and to bring vs to their courts and assizes how much more should this worke an awe and reuerence when we consider that christ iesus shall come and apprehend and attach each of vs before his barre of iudgement secondly he propounds the coming of christ himselfe he comes that is christ shall descend from the highest heauen in his manhood to that place where the cloudes be to the earth locally in that he saith not shall come but in the present time he comes first he sheweth it is a thing not farre off but present secondly that it is certain euen as though he now came thirdly he wold haue vs consider of the coming of christ not as a thing to come farre off but present this s john learned and so shold we by his example learne that it is present and perswade our selues so and therefore we should often thinke and consider of the coming of christ seeing it is of so great vse hence then our dutie is to do that euery day which we would do in the day of iudgement seeing it is alwaies present we must do think and speake that which we would do that day he which can do so he is an happie man now that a man may come to do this we must daily consider of that coming of christ not as a thing to be delayed or farre off but as a thing present we must euery day call our selues to a reckoning and accompt perswade our selues this may be the last day and so to carie our selues euery day as we would in the last day now if we were so perswaded then we should see lesse wickednesses in our life we would repent and seeke to be reconciled to god in christ we should be more faithfull amp see more grace daily in our liues and the cause of the want of faith and repentance and of grace it is the want of this perswasion that we should carie our selues euery day as we would in the last day euen in faith and repentance in that he saith he commeth hence we gather he is absent in bodily presence in regard of his manhood he is not here but in heauen till the day of iudgement for if christ were alwaies bodily present he could not be said to come but onely to manifest himselfe being before present then the opinion of the papists which hold the bodie of christ is present in or about the bread of the sacrament is most false and friuolous he proceedeth and setteth out the manner of christs comming in two things first that he comes in the cloudes secondly that his coming is open and visible to euery eye with cloudes here s john speaketh after the maner of the auncient prophets who to set out god in his maiestie and glorie say he comes with cloudes rides on the wings of the wind as though he had said he comes in exceeding maiestie and glorie these words are added to make a distinction betweene the first and second coming of christ his first coming was in humilitie borne of a poore virgin entertained in a stable and in an inne but his second comming is with glorie maiestie and dominion in the cloudes and the reason is because he came first to be a redemption and a sauiour and therfore in the state of a servant but his second coming is to be a iudge of all man yes of his enemy and therefore in this coming he cometh with all might maiestie and glorie the vse of this consideration is set downe in the psalme to make the very mountaines to tremble to confound the wicked and vngodly and to comfort the godly in that day secondly it is not secret but in open appearance euery eye shall see him he shall come in maiestie and glorie not secretly but in visible shew to all the world all man shall see him with their owne eyes all i say which were since the world began to his coming in these words he sets downe three points first that all man shal see him secondly that all man being raised againe shal haue life and motion and their senses restored to them as before they died thirdly that all man none excepted shall come and stand before the tribunall seate of christ this is a comfort to god children in that they being dead amp rotten in their graues shall rise and receiue their life and motio and see christ their sauiour and iudge of all man if a man should lie downe to sleepe and be told that when he rose he should see his dead father and mother or his dearest friends this would be a notable comfort to him that so he should inioy them againe but this should be a farre greater comfort to vs that we which lie dead and rotten in the graue shall be raised and enioy not our parents and friends but christ iesus the son of god which is our frind aboue all friends who shall giue vs not onely life and motion but eternall life with his owne maiestie this was iobs comfort that though he died yet he beleeued he should see his redeemer with his eyes and this should be our comfort against the feare of death and the last iudgement it shall be a terror to the wicked amp to all impenitent sinners who shall wil they nil they be brought to the barre of christs iudgement seate and then looke on him who is their iudge whom they had in their life contemned and this consideration may serue to moue vs to repentance which haue not begun to repent and to labor to becom the members of christ we think when we die all is done there is no harme to follow but though we lie rotting in our graues a thousand or two thousand yeares yet we shall rise and if we repented not we shall heare the sentence of condemnation and looke vpon our iudge with our owne eyes then it is best for vs now in the time of grace while we liue here to prepare that we need not feare to come to appeare and behold this iudge no doubt if we were perswaded that we should thus appeare it would moue vs to repent euery eye shall see him then here we see that all man with their owne eyes shall looke on him and those who wanted them in this life shall haue them restored it is graunted of all diuines that the elect haue all their senses and other defects restored and it is to be added that the wicked too they shal haue all their powers senses and faculties of soule and body restored the deafe shall heare the blind shall see this iudge but this can be no glory to them seeing it is to increase their punishment for the more senses they haue they haue the more punishment because we iudge of things by sense euen of those which pierced him this is added first to shew that we shal be freed no power or wisedom of any man or monarch can free vs from appearing for if any could escape then the iewes and gentiles who preuailed most against christ in that they put him to death but none of these can escape his iudgement for euen they which pierced him they shall see this iudge amp be summoned before his maiestie for though they had power to kill him yet none of them shall haue power to absent themselues from before his barre to shew the case of all wicked man namely that such wo and misery befals them as they neuer dreamed of the iewes and gentiles they crucified christ and put him to a temporall death but they neuer dreamed he should condemne them to eternall death to shew the rufull and wofull estate of all impenitent sinners for these man shall haue their greatest enemy to be their iudge who will shew rigour vpon them and iustice without all mercy and this is meant not only of the iew which pierced him but of all impenitent sinners because all such do by their sins as swords and speares wound him at the heart as the souldiers did these be as bad as the iewes which pierced christ as iudas which betrayed christ amp as the souldiers which goared his sides out of these words some gather that the body of christ hath still the wounds and scarres which here he had giuen him the print of the nailes in his hands and in his feete and that these shall be seene in christ at the last day and say that it is no infirmitie to christ to haue these but rather an increase of his glory but this cannot be gathered hence for though it be said they shall see him whom they pierced yet not as he was pierced and because they shall see him shall they see his wounds many shall see kings and queenes whom they crowned in this world ergo as kings and queenes so we shall see our fathers amp mothers therefore as fathers and mothers so many shall see christ therefore as he was wounded and pierced it is no good collection nor opinion and all the tribes of the earth shall waile for him that is before or ouer him here is the fruit and effect of his comming especially in the wicked all the tribes of the earth s john he speakes here of the world as it was in the condition and diuision of the land of canaan for before that time it was not diuided into tribes so math setteth out the iudgement of the whole world by the separation of the sheep from the goates noting that they which repented not of what tribe soeuer of what estate or condition shall waile and mourne and he addes a reason of this for him before him or ouer him that is they shal waile and lament with exceeding lamentation because they beleeued not his word but contemned his doctrine and therefore now they want all helpe to free them from the punishment of their vnbeleefe and contempt of the gospell if they shall mourne because they did not beleeue and receiue the doctrine of christ and for that haue no way to escape then it is our dutie to labour aboue all things to be reconciled to god in christ to get our sinnes pardoned to beleeue and embrace the word of god for vnlesse we beleeue and be reconciled when the last day comes there is no hope of helpe no way to escape no time of grace to repent if the doore be once shut we must stand without there is nothing then but horror of conscience for vs it will be a day to vs to make our eyes start out of our heads a day of all woe and misery then it is great wisdome so to spend the time of grace in this life especially that we may get the pardon of our sins reconciliation with god in christ to receiue and beleeue his will and word which if we do we shall haue no cause at all to waile and mourne but be glad and reioyce then we must take heed the diuell steale not out of our hearts this one lesson which is most necessary which he wil most labour for to do see what an euill conscience is it lieth asleepe here while a man liues it neuer troubleth him but in this last day when he shall see his iudge with his eyes then it wil stirre it wil torment him it will attach accuse and condemne him it will lay to his charge his sinnes his contempt of christ and his word his vnbeleefe in the time of grace it will be as a thousand witnesses to condemne him this should cause all man to labour to get a good conscience washed and purged in the blood of christ which will not lay to our charge any one sinne but assure vs we be in the fauour of god which wil not make vs feare but looke vp to our redeemer and to reioyce in him we must take heed when our conscience lieth asleepe and accuseth not no not at death for it will then deceiue vs but search and examine our hearts and consciences and seeke to haue them washed and bathed in the blood of christ lastly he confirmeth this doctrine of the second comming of christ by a double note of asseueratio eue so amen one of these is taken fro the ebrewes amen the second from the grecians euen as we auouch a thing first by a simple and bare affirmation or negation secondly by an earnest asseueration thirdly by an oath now in that s john vseth these two kinds of assuring in this weightie matter of christs second coming we see our dutie we must not vse the like at any time or thing but onely in matters of weight and moment so s john here he shall come and that certainly vndoubtedly it shalbe so then the practise of the is wicked which vse these words in matters of no weight at euery word and much more which bind euery word with an oath which is far more yes though our sauior ofte vseth these words of asseueration yet onely in matters of weight and moment and when the hearers were to be certified of the truth of a thing which was of importance he would by this shew that the coming of christ is certaine and most vndoubted and to make vs out of all doubt he addeth these two words of asseueratio eue so ame most certainly it will come then we should often thinke of this matter for in our nature there is a corruption which perswadeth vs that the coming of christ is not yet that we shall not be summoned either by generall or particular iudgement therefore as the wicked servant we deferre the comming of christ to take away this corruption he saith he cometh yes certainely vndoubtedly he cometh and that out of hand thirdly to shew a speciall note and marke of god child for he doth not onely asseuere but withall desireth and longeth for the coming of christ lord let it be so amen let it euen be so they long for and desire christ his coming to iudgment but the wicked could wish with all their hearts that it might neuer be the godly they know that when christ shall come then they shall haue that crowne of immortalitie and glorie which he hath prepared for all which desire his coming but the wicked and they which are not reconciled to god in christ nor assured of their owne saluation they cannot for their life once wish and desire the coming of christ so that by this one note we may iudge of our owne estates whether we belong to christ or not for if we desire and long for his second comming to iudgement if we wish he would come quickly then it is a certain token and signe we be reconciled to god in christ that we belong to him but if as yet we feele not this longing and hungring desire in vs then we must suspect our selues and labour to feele it euery day for it is the desire of the saints and of all the true children of god after that s john had described christ at large here in this eighth verse he bringeth him in speaking of himselfe by a figure i am alpha and omega saith the lord the end and scope of this eighth verse is to confirme the former description of christ the reason is thus framed he which is the beginning and the end of all he is sufficient to be a king priest and prophet and is both able and willing to bestow all blessings on his church this first part of the argument is omitted the second part is contained in this eighth verse but i am the beginning and the end ampc i am sufficient ampc in this eighth verse are three points concerning christ first he is the beginning and the end i am alpha and omega secondly he is was and is to come thirdly he is almightie omnipotent the first point is that christ is the beginning and the end which he expresseth by a comparison taken from the greeke alphabet or the a b c of the grecians for as in their greeke alphabet is the first letter and the last so i saith christ am the beginning of all things and the end of all as those letters in the greeke alphabet so am i in all things the first and last out of this that christ borroweth this comparison from the greeke alphabet the papists gather that the word may be read and deliuered to the people in an vnknowne toung because christ here vseth an vnknowne toung to those whom he gaue this vision but though the vnlearned and vnlettered english man knoweth not what and is yet the church to who this booke was written being the grecians knew what they meant generally againe though the spirit of god vseth a strange word in one place we may not follow that in the whole word of god in the whole seruice and worship of god as the papists do christ is said to be the beginning and the end first because he is the very first of all things there was nothing before he was he had a being when all other creatures were not but begunne to be then was he the same that he is now he had his being and subsisting before all creatures and for this saith s john chap verse in the beginning was the word that is the son of god he had his being and subsisting when all other creatures wanted it and began to be this proueth the eternitie of christ because he had his being before any creature was created he was a substance and essence begotten of the father before all worlds not created as other creatures are or made of any other secondly he is called the beginning because he giueth a beginning to all creatures for all things which were created were created by him and had their being from him so that he is the true beginning of all things coloss all things are from him he is the beginning of all and all are for him he is the end of all seeing christ giues a being to all things then we when we are to beginne any businesse in word or deed we must begin it with inuocation on the name of christ for christ he giues the beginning and proceeding to all things then we which haue our beginnings of him must not dare to begin anything without inuocation on his name secondly the same christ he is the end of all things for two causes first because he is the last of all things and after him is nothing in subsisting and being nay if all creatures were left to themselues they would all come to nothing and yet though all should come to nothing christ would remaine the same he was for euer namely the eternall son and word of the father in that some creatures are become eternall this is not of themselues but by christ he giues them eternall being and durance and if they were left to themselues they would come to nothing as well as others this then shold make vs with full purpose of heart to cleaue to christ if we would enioy eternall happinesse for without him and vnlesse we haue it from him we cannot but come to an end secondly he is the end because all things were made to serue him coloss for him were all things created which is was and is to come these words were expounded in the fourth verse where the very same are affirmed of the father the sense is that christ is a substance and essence or being subsisting in by and from himselfe and such a substance shall be for euer hence we learne two things first that the second person in the trinitie is consubstantiall with the father of one and the same substance and nature with him and the reason is because there can be but one onely substance essence and being which can be in and by it selfe and from it selfe alone there cannot be two or moe but onely one as there cannot be two eternals or two infinits two omnipotents and absolute lord which haue nothing one of another now in the fourth verse it is said of the father that he is a substance of in by and from himselfe alone and here of the son is rehearsed the same then they seeing there can be but one such essence must needs be all one and the son must needes be the same substance nature and essence with the father not like him or diverse from him but the selfe same in substance and nature that is their godhead is consubstantiall ampc they be indeed two distinct persons yet but one substance and diuine essence in the godhead which s john intimates affirming the same words of both hence we learne that christ is god of himselfe for in the same respect the father is god he is god and as the father is was and is to come so in the same regard is christ ampc but the father is god of himselfe ergo also christ is god of himselfe indeed as he is the son so he is of the father hath this beginning from him but as he is god he is consubstantiall with the father and coequall with him hath his essence of and in himselfe and the same is to be affirmed of the holy ghost as he is the third person he proceedes from the father and the son but as he is god he is of from and in himselfe that christ is coeternall with the father and as euerlasting as he is euery way coequall to the father hauing the same attributes equally with him as he is god the almightie as there is in god so is there in christ a double power first a potentiall secondly an actuall power potentiall is that whereby he can do many things moe then he wil do as he could raise children to abraham of the stones but he would not he could haue deliuered christ from death but he would not it is not taken for this power here principally but rather for the second namely his actuall power whereby he bringeth to passe without let and impediment whatsoeuer he decreeth willeth or promiseth so he is called almightie here because he bringeth to passe actually whatsoeuer he promiseth to his in his word without let and stop seeing he is thus almightie hence come two comforts to his children first that whatsoeuer he hath promised his church in christ shall be brought to passe effectually without stop and let as assuredly as he promised it now since he promiseth in the gospell to all penitent sinners remission of sinnes mortification iustification and life euerlasting euery one of them in their time shall be done euery true beleeuer shall haue pardon of his sinnes mortification sanctification and eternall life because he which promised is almightie able and willing to do all he promised this is a comfort to all true beleeuers for all man and angels cannot giue one of these but christ he is omnipotent he can and will giue them all he will and can giue his church sufficient securitie and ease from all her enemy he can defend and guard her against all their furie and malice he is aboue them and can bridle their might when and how he pleaseth this then affoords vs two duties first in the crosse and tribulation to humble our selues vnder the hand of god for it is the lord which correcteth vs he is able to do what he list and more then he will secondly this should make vs to performe heartie obedience in our generall and particular callings to walke vprightly before him seeing he is almightie and seeth whether we walke sincerely or not if we do not he is able to punish vs gen it is the argument of god to perswade abraham to walke vprightly because he is almightie able to correct and destroy those which refuse to obey him thus farre of the two first parts of this chapter the inscription and the titles of this booke i john ampc here followeth the third part of this chapter which containeth a vision from this ninth verse to the end of the third chapter in this vision two things are to be noted first the circumstances secondly the parts the circumstances in the ninth and tenth verses the parts from thence to the end of the third chapter the circumstances of this vision are the first touching the person to whom this vision befell john the second the place where in pathmos the third the maner how it is propounded it was deliuered to him being rauished in the spirit the fourth the time when on the lord day the first circumstance is the person to whom this vision befell john he doth this to shew that it was giuen him of the lord for as the lord hath his visions and reuelations so the diuell hath his but they be distinguished by the persons to whom they be giuen god giueth his visions not to all man but to those which are most fit for them such as be most holy man for life indued with exceeding gifts of god as knowledge wisdome constancie zeale pietie and religion so in the old testament he deliuered the to his prophets not to all but his servant man of singular gifts and graces and of exceeding holinesse and pietie indeed the lord reuealed some particular things to wicked man as to balaam but they neuer knew them comfortably it is a propertie belonging to the servant of god to haue a vision reuealed and to know the same now both these befell s john he was a man of exceeding holinesse of life for christ loued him and of singular and rare gifts now the diuell maketh no such choice but his visions befall man which are heretikes wicked notorious sinners and they haue no rare and speciall gifts as the other so that by this a man may distinguish them by the persons to whom they befall then we must esteeme of it as a singular gift of god giuen to his owne apostle s john after the description of christ john describes himselfe by many modest tearmes first your brother that is of them being members all of the mysticall bodie christ iesus for the church of god is a familie god the father is head and housholder iesus christ is the elder brother we all are fellow brother in and by christ being by him the adopted sonnes of god and brother to each other by this title first he setteth out his humilitie and great modestie for he was a man at that time aboue all man which liued in regard of his gifts and holinesse of life he was the last apostle and had apostolicall authoritie being a most true professor yet he calleth himselfe a brother to all true beleeuers maketh himselfe but equall with them though they were farre inferiour to him and so should we esteeme better of all our brother then of our selues and make our selues inferior to them secondly by this title we see he had his hart full of brotherly loue to all the members of the church of christ so we are bound to loue all man as they be of the same flesh with vs but those which be of the same faith amp religion to these especially should we shew our loue and affection it is good reason that they which haue the same head christ the same god the same faith hope religion and redemption by iesus christ should be so affected to one another and being linked by all these should haue a more neare loue then is between man amp man but in this world as esay saith man hate their brother euen for the profession of the same religion whereby they thinke to be saued if they liue with more conscience then others then they reuile speake ill of and hate them for the name of christ the second title companion or fellow partner compartner in tribulations in the kingdome and in patience he was partner with them in tribulations for two causes first because at that time when he wrote this vision the whole church was in persecutio and tribulation vnder that cruell tyrant domitian about fourescore or an hundred yeares after christ and so he fled to pathmos at that time and being mindfull of the afflictions of the church whereof he was a member he cals himselfe a partner with them in affliction by which he shewes our estate that it is to be vnder the crosse to liue in affliction not to be companions of peace and ease but partakers of affliction and tribulation and therfore those which will be christs disciples and follow him they must deny themselues and take vp their crosse dayly and because of this estate the church in this world is called the militant church now seeing the state of the church is in tribulation we in this land and church which haue had peace and quietnes so long without persecution we must know that it is giuen vs that now in the time of peace we might prepare our selues against the day of triall and persecution for seeing the estate of the church is to be vnder affliction and persecution we are bound to looke for it and know that the lord will come and try his church for it must increase and grow by triall the lord hath sent labourers into his haruest a long time which haue gathered much wheate into the lord barne now there must come a day when the lord will take his fan and siue into his hands and will with the fan and siue of persecution try the wheat and winnow the corne from the chaffe that it may appeare who are his true children then stands it vs in hand to take heed we be found good corne and not chaffe that we may abide the siue that we proue not light corne blowne about with the wind and fit to be cast into the fire to be burnt he cals himselfe their fellow partner in affliction because his pitifull hart was moued with compassion to all his fellow members and partners in affliction when he remembred their persecution and affliction they suffered vnder the cruell tyrant dominitian now looke what was in him the same affection should be in vs our hearts should be pitifull full of compassion for the poore afflicted members of christ seeing they be our fellow members we should haue a fellow feeling with them and shew our compassion in pittying them if the foote be pricked the head stoopes the eye beholds and lookes on it the finger puls it out the hand applies the plaister the other foot is ready to run for help the tongue to aske for counsell and all the members are ready to affoord their mutuall helpe in pittie and fellow feeling so when any members of the church suffer affliction be pricked with persecution for christs cause then should we as fellow members of one body be ready to do all the helpe we can to them especially in shewing our fellow feeling with them in the kingdome of christ that is the kingdome of heauen in that he sets first afliction then addes a kingdome he shewes that the afflictions amp crosse for christs sake is the ready way to the kingdom of heauen it is the way which is beaten and troden by the prophets apostles and the saints of god as the apostle saith through manifold tribulations we must enter into heauen and this momentany affliction causeth to vs an infinite weight of glory not that it deserues or effects it but that it is the pathway to heauen then we must not thinke it strange when it befalleth vs for it is the meanes to bring wandring sheepe out of the way into the ready and beaten way to heauen nay it is rather to be thought strange when we haue no affliction for then we be gone out of the way seeing the lord afflicts euery child which is his in patience a vertue whereby we are made able to perseuere in affliction to go on suffering till we come to heauen afflictions are the beaten way heauen is our ioyfull end patience is the meanes to make vs perseuere and go on till we come to our iourneys end rom hope to come to heauen is obtained by patience which maketh a beleeuer to go on suffering till he come to life eternall there is much fruite in the good ground but not obtained without patience and the true beleeuer liues by hope in this life yet cannot come to heauen without patience iames now because man will say patience is a hard matter and so are discouraged therfore to set an edge on their desire he addes it is the kingdome and patience of christ first because he commaunds it secondly patience cometh from the spirit of christ thirdly because as he suffereth in his members it is called his patience for their misery and suffering is his when his members suffer he suffereth and this is a singular comfort to al suffering the crosse that they haue christ their fellow sufferer he takes part with them puts vnder his shoulder he is content to suffer with them and in these three standeth the communion of saints in suffering tribulation the first step to this fellowship amp communion of saints is to beare and be in tribulation and he which is not come to that is not yet in the communio of saints then secondly he must patiently beare them perseuere without grudging or repining then followes the last which is the end of all the enioying of the kingdome of heauen which was in the ile called pathmos in these words is the second circumstance namely the place where this vision was giuen to john namely in the ile pathmos an iland and one of those which the geographers call sporades lying on the left side of the churches of asia neare to the east churches by the sea commonly called the egean sea this iland was a small base and poore iland litle or neuer a whit inhabited s john had his vision not at ierusalem at antioch or rome but in pathmos a base poore and litle inhabited iland by which we see that in the new testament there is no respect of one place aboue another in regard of god presence and our fellowship with him he doth as well giue john this vision in pathmos as to others his prophets and apostles in ierusalem in the old testament there was regard of places as the lord shewed his presence and tyed his worship especially to his tabernacle and temple at ierusalem there was the place where he would be worshipped which daniel in his prophecy sheweth for being in captiuitie he in his chamber openeth the window which was towards the temple at ierusalem but now in the new testament that regard of place is abolished tim pray euery where lifting vp pure hands in regard of god worship and presence in all the duties of religion we must do the like then away with popish pilgrimage to churches and chappels of saints or to their reliques for this is meere superstition for god is present euery where and a man may haue fellowship with him in one place as wel as another also this may serue to correct our false conceit we haue of our churches and chappels for we come into our common houses wherein we dwell and neuer humble our selues we thinke in these places we need not but if we come into the church neuer so often we then fall downe and humble our hearts in prayer the reason is because we thinke that god is more present there and we should sooner be heard there then in our houses and that they be more holy but in the new testament now all such diuersitie of place is abolished in regard of god seruice and presence indeed churches must be maintained because in them the people may more conueniently meete together to serue god but we must not think but that common houses are as holy as they for god seruice onely for decency sake when we that are many may assemble together in one place they be more holy then any dwelling house for that time when the word is preached and prayer made in them in this circumstance of place note two things first by what meanes s john came thither secondly to what end and for what cause first he came thither by banishment the emperour domitian exiled him secondly he came for the word of god he came and abode in pathmos being banished for the gospels sake in this banishment consider first that s john was a most worthy apostle endued with rare gifts a singular maintainer of the gospell and a famous founder of the church of god and chiefe guide thereof in those dayes and for this cause most hated of the cruel persecutor domitian amp of the romanes yet whereas many other of the true christians were put to the sword s john is not he escapeth and was banished the cause of this was god speciall prouidence by which he had reserued him for the benefit of the church that he might receiue this reuelation and commit it to the church to the perpetuall good of all his children and so though domitian was a cruell tyrant yet he could not kill him but god ouer ruled him that he did but banish him into this iland wherein he receiued these visions and penned them for the good of the church by this we see the great care and prouidence of god that he hath ouer his church that he doth bridle and ouer rule the minds and might of cruell emperours that they cannot but do al that they do to the glory of god though they intend the contrary for domitian intended only the hurt of john yet see by his banishment into that ile he had fit place to receiue these visions for the good of the church so in the death of christ the iewes and gentiles and all man banded themselues together to put christ to death and the diuell he laboured to stirre them on to practise their intended malice yet the prouidence of god directeth and ordereth this their malice and wicked practise to the redemption of mankind so iosephs brother intended no such deliuerace as god wrought by him in selling their brother this consideration should comfort all god children ampc when we are oppressed and persecuted by tyrants for christs sake we must make no resistance offer no violence but suffer all things without resisting for the christians weapons are onely prayers and teares and s john often in this booke addeth after the foretelling of persecution here is the patience of saints shewing that must be the complet armour against all out enemy seeing he came into this island not of his owne accord but by violence and constraint he thought it not a good and happy kind of life for if he had come into this place being litle or not inhabited he could not do this dutie of his apostleship he could not haue founded the church this then confuteth the monkish life which is no life of holy perfection as they call it but of great superstition s john would not haue left all company of man but that he was compelled to leaue the then the life of those which voluntarily leaue all company of man liuing in cloisters and secret places cannot be a life of perfection but of all imperfection man is borne to do good to others seeing s john was banished and here receiued his visions we see that those which honour god he will honour them for s john was banished then which what could they do more to hurt him yet then because it was for god cause god doth most honour him in reuealing to him these visions so when ioseph was sold of his brother and most dishonoured of them then god exalted him the same may be said of daniel who when he was most dishonoured of man then the lord exalted him aboue all other man and the same is true of all god children they which honor him he will honour them the cause for which he came into this isle for the word of god that is because he was by calling a publisher and preacher of the word of god for which cause he was banished by which we may note that all naturall man as domitian and the romaines were and all man are by nature hate all that professe god hate his word they cannot abide it for s john a most worthie apostle a famous man for gifts a singular preacher of the word of god yet for this very cause is hunted nay banished not for his owne cause but for the word of god this hath bene seene in all heathen emperours yes and all man by nature hate the word yet though they hate it in their hearts the same word it winneth them and hath taken place in them to conuert them and to make them to loue it which sheweth that the word taught by the prophets and apostles is indeed the true word of god not the inuention of man for if the word which is hated of all man by nature had not some diuine power in it it could neuer make such me to loue it by grace which hate it by nature for no word of man can make a man which hateth the same to loue it but onely the word of god seeing john was banished for god word all ministers are to cast their accompts to make a reckoning that they may and must suffer persecution nay banishment for the word of god for that which the principall founders and chiefe builders of the church haue suffered that cannot be auoyded of them which are ordinarie ministers christ he acquainted his disciples with this and telleth them that they are euen accursed when all man speake well of them luke they must not seeke to haue all thinke well of them but rather feare if all man like of them they are accursed and witnesse bearing that is for the testimonie of the history and doctrine of the gospell the summe whereof is that iesus christ the son of mary is our redeemer to procure to vs righteousnesse and life euerlasting now he addeth after the other this of the gospell as a doctrine how to come to life euerlasting and righteousnesse in iesus christ to shew for what part of the word we are most hated and persecuted not so much for the law as for the gospell because the law is partly natural the gospell is aboue nature as to beleeue that god made his couenant with our first parents that the seed of the woma shold bruise the serpents head now the gospell is the glad tidings in which there is declared that the promised seed is come and therefore the diuell he hateth this part most of all and laboureth man to hinder the course of the gospell rather then of the law so three hundred yeares after christ he laboured by might and maine to extinguish the gospell to keepe man in ignorance of the messiah but when he could not preuaile by force amp might he vsed sophistrie and deceipt and brought in heresies to obscure the truth of the gospell and to ouerthrow the natures offices and benefites of christ then we are bound to do the contrarie seeing he laboureth to extinguish it we must labour to maintaine and defend it we must labour as much to know it as he doth to keepe vs in ignorance that so we may obey and beleeue it and i was rauished on the lord day ampc in this tenth verse are two circumstances the first which is the third in number is the maner of receiuing this vision and giuing of it to john namely in a traunce the second or fourth the time on that lord day or that day of the lord i was in the spirit here we see he receiued this vision in a trance i was in the spirit that is i was by the mightie and extraordinarie worke of the spirit of god cast into a traunce this appeareth by comparing this prophecie with other as with that of ezechiel who when he receiued any vision was cast into a traunce by god spirit to vnderstand this consider two things first what a trance is secondly the end of it a trance is an extraordinarie worke or action of god spirit ergo not of the constellation and temperature of the starres nor from the constitution of mans bodie or imaginations of man but wrought by the holy ghost secondly it is not euery worke but an extraordinarie work aboue the order of nature a powerfull and mightie work of the holy ghost wherein the whole man both in bodie and mind is altered and for that cause s john saith i was in the spirit this action consisteth in two actions one of the mind and the other of the bodie in procuring a trance the spirit of god casteth a man into a dead sleepe whereby all the senses both inward and outward are benummed so gen when god renewed the couenant with abraham he cast him into a trance that is into a dead sleepe the senses all were benummed onely the mind and soule working the other action of the holy ghost is on the mind to draw it from fellowship with the bodie and all the senses to haue fellowship with god that so the spirit of god may enlighten it with light and knowledge of things which are to reuealed to it and so we see in other extasies and traunces as that of peter his mind was drawne from the fellowship with the bodie and was in fellowship with god then a trance is a mightie and powerfull worke of the holy ghost both in bodie and mind whereby both the mind is drawne from fellowship with the bodie and vnto the fellowship of god and also enlightened with light and knowledge of god to vnderstand things to be reuealed now followeth the end of a trance the cause why man are cast into trances in receiuing any visions is that as s john here they might know that the things deliuered were not inuented of themselues but giuen of god for in john his bodie and all his senses were benummed he neither heard saw nor felt but they were asleepe and therefore the vision must needes be from god secondly that they might take the deeper impression in his and their mind for when the mind is freed from fellowship with the bodie not hindered by any fantasies of the senses they being all asleepe and quiet then the mind hath best oportunitie to attend and marke to know and vnderstand and also to imprint deeper in memorie things reuealed here we see the great care of god who would not haue his children to receiue these visions by senses imperfectly but that they might throughly vnderstand know beleeue and carie the away in faithfull memorie he deliuered them in extasies and trances the mind then being no whit hindred with fellowship of the bodie but freed from the same the like care had he of his prophets that they might certainely know constantly beleeue and faithfully remember those visions he would not haue their minds troubled with the fellowship of the bodie or of the senses inward or outward and there is good reason of this for they which must teach a thing to other to make them know and vnderstand to beleeue and remember the same it is reason they should vnderstand and hold it themselues and keepe it well in memorie this seeing the lord did to make them to vnderstand more throughly to beleeue more constantly and to carie away more faithfully this teacheth ministers that they must haue also the through vnderstanding and knowledge of the word beleeue it constantly and remember it carefully now we must not looke for and expect trances as they had but we must come to this by continuall studie in the word which is the ordinarie meanes to come to that knowledge it is the meanes by which all man preachers students and hearers do know then we should seeke to be cunning in the text of scripture to vnderstand the proper sense of it to be good text man to vnderstand beleeue and remember it then this is a fault of those which in studying of diuinity wil rather reade auncient writings of man nay the base writings of of wicked and hereticall friers then of the holy word of god in that he receiued this vision amp will of god in a trance and had it so made fully known vnto him we see that though he was indued with singular gifts yet the lord addeth more knowledge to his former so that we see that saying iustified to him which hath shall be giuen s john being so carefull to do his dutie of an apostle the lord reuealeth his will to him in most full maner euen so all that haue care to know the will and word of god though their knowledge be small at the first yet the lord will help them adde dayly to their knowledge and increase it so we see why many heare the word but increase not but waxe worse or stand at a stay the reason is because they labour not to haue their knowledge increased for if they did then to him which hath he should haue more added nay contrarily when we be negligent to heare and to know the wil and word of god we haue a spirit indeed but not god but the spirit of slumber of blindnes and ignorance so that we see and see not heare and vnderstand not esay on the lord day in these words is the fourth circumstance namely the time when this vision was graunted to s john this day which here is called the lord day among the iewes was the first day of the weeke called by vs sunday it is called the lord day for two causes first because on this day christ rose from death to life for christ was buried the euen of the iewes sabbath which is our friday and he rested in the graue their whole sabbath which is our saturday and rose the first day of the weeke early in the morning which is our sunday and for this cause first it is called the lord day it is called the lord day because this first day to the beleeuing iewes was to them in stead of their sabbath in which day they worshipped god solemnely it was the day appointed to his seruice among them and for this cause especially it is called the lord day to vnderstand how it is called the lord day we must know three points first who changed this day from the iewes sabbath secondly for what cause thirdly whether the church haue now in the new testament power to change the sabbath day to any other day then this seuenth day the changer and appointer of this sabbath of the new testament was christ himselfe though it be commonly thought that the church in the new testament and christian emperors changed it my reasons are these that which the apostles deliuered and inioyned the church that they receiued from christ either by voice or instinct for they deliuered nothing of their owne head but they deliuered this amp inioyned this sabath to the church although they receiued it from christ that they inioyned this day of rest and sabbath to the church it appeareth corinthian for paul ordained that the collection for the poore should be on the first day of the weeke he ordained it and left it not to the choise of the church but appointed it by authoritie apostolicall from christ now the day of collecting for the poore as appeareth in the history of the church was the sabbath day when the people were assembled then they vsed to make their collection for before that collection there went the word preached and the sacrament of the lord supper and this was the custom of the church many yeares after christ first to haue the word preached and the sacraments administred then to gather for the poore and for this cause the lord supper is called a sacrifice or a masse not as the papists vse it but because in it we offer not to the lord but to the poore which was sent them and so gaue the name to that sacrament to be called the masse by which it appeareth that they appointed by apostolicall authoritie the first day of the weeke to be the sabbath of the new testament which here is called the lord day a second reason is this the apostles kept this day for the sabbath of the new testament act and it cannot be proued that they obserued any other day for the sabbath but onely in one case when they liued among the iewes when they kept their old sabbath a third reason is john that same day which christ rose from death being the first day of the weeke he appeared to his disciples to instruct them and the eight day after he appeared again the first day of the weeke instructing them in matters belonging to the kingdome of heauen now it is more then likely christ would celebrate and keepe that day for a sabbath wherein he rose and the eight day after appeared to instruct his disciples now the sabbath of the iewes was changed for two causes first to maintaine the liberty of the church of the new testament whereof this was a great part that they were freed from the ceremonies of the iewes for here when this day was changed the church was no more tied to the iewes sabbath day neither had any such regard after of dayes and times secondly that there might be a more fit time for the remembrance of the worke of redemption for as god in the old testament appointed the seuenth day to be a day of rest to remember the first creation so there should be a day to celebrate this worke which is a wonderfull creation in which we are made new man so that there is now a new heauen and new earth as isay speaketh chap nay this is a more glorious work then that seeing in that creation adam was the head in this christ iesus he is the head in that adam was the chiefe in this christ in that heuah was giuen to adam in this we to christ his church to him in that adam had an earthly paradise in this redemption we haue a spirituall kingdome in that god mercy onely in this both his mercy and iustice in punishing of chirst and giuing vs forgiuenes appeared in that god shewed his wisdome amp goodnes but in part but herein this he shewed it fully in that he made man of nothing but now he made him of worse then nothing amp better then euer he was therfore seeing this day of our redemption is farre passing that and the lord appointed a day for the remembrance thereof much more should there be one for the remembrance of this now there is no day fitter then that day wherein christ iesus rose from death to life to remember his resurrection but may the church now in the new testament change the sabbath to any other day as to tuesday wednesday ampc answer it cannot i thinke because times and seasons belong to god he alone can dispose of the act the church hath not knowledge of times and seasons much lesse of the ordering and disposing of them for that which the father keepeth in his owne bosome the church cannot know but the father alone so keepeth times and seasons therfore the church cannot know them and as the church of the iewes had not power to change their sabbath no more hath the church in the new testament to change their sabbaths ob but the iewes had authoritie to appoint feasts therfore they could appoint sabbath dayes hest they for their deliuerance appoint a day of rest of reioycing so maccab they appointed indeed solemne dayes for reioycing and solemne feasts for speciall deliuerance but they appointed not any day for a sabath amp rest for the whole seruice of god some hold that the church hath power to alter it nay to make any day the sabbath or if it could be conueniently two dayes in a weeke but they haue no warrant out of the word if this day the lord day be a day to remember the death resurrection and merits of christ we see three sorts of man here reproued first them which make this day a day of pleasure pastime and delight for most young man and servant imploy this day wholy on their own delights and pleasures making it a day of carnall reioycing spending it in eating drink carding dicing riot and excesse so that they turne this lord day set apart to his worship into a day to offer sacrifice to the diuel the second sort is of them which liue more ciuilly then the former yet they thinke they may do their owne businesse and take iorneys on this day and that vpon this false ground that a man may aswell and with as honest and good an heart serue god in his owne businesse at home as they which go to church but by this they make the lord day appointed to his seruice their owne day to do their owne worke and not his the third sort is of those which keepe the sabbath onely at morning and euening prayer but as for the rest of the day they may spend it how they will on their owne pleasures and pastimes or their owne businesse and of this sort are many in the world who come to the church but onely so far as the law of the land inioynes them and these man part stakes with god they giue him one part and that the less and bestow the other on their owne businesse or pleasure whereas it is the lord day not in part but in whole and so they breake the fourth commaundement then on the contrary our dutie is to keep this day a sabbath to the lord as we are commaunded in the fourth commandement we must rest from all our sinnes secondly from all the workes of our callings and imploy it wholly on the seruice of god sanctifying this day of rest to the worship of god from the morning to the euening now there is a double sanctifying of the sabbath first publicke in the congregation when we come to the church to pray and giue thankes and there to heare the word and receiue the sacraments secondly priuate when man in their owne priuate houses at home sanctifie it in meditating reading and thinking of the word in praying priuatly and giuing thankes for benefits we must not imploy that day in our owne businesse if the officer should take our servant from our works amp set him about the common good we would be grieued and if we take the day appointed to god seruice and bestow it on our owne affaires shall not the lord be offended and the cause why we heare the word publikely and neuer profit is because we sanctifie the sabbath onely publikely and not priuatly so that vnlesse we meditate reade the word pray and sanctifie the sabbath at home we may heare and reade the word publikely but without all increase of grace faith knowledge and repentance but if we performe neither it is not possible to get any grace seeing this day is set apart for that end now to proceed the reason why the lord he gaue john these visions rather on this day then another is because though john was absent in body from the church yet he was present in spirit in praying for it at this time for being absent he would shew his presence in such duties as he could performe in that solitary place as fasting prayer ampc now when he was thus occupied the lord reuealeth his will to him concerning the estate of the church to the end of the world seeing john being in the isle of pathmos a desert place yet he kept the sabboth in all such duties as he could performe hence we see that they which are absent from the church as in prison sicke of some great disease or on the sea yet they must keepe the sabbath they must pray fast and call on the name of god ampc in that he receiued the vision then when he was exercised in praying and fasting here is a comfort for the children of god that when man draw neare to god he draweth neare to them iam john a worthie apostle being in banishment he draweth neare to god in fasting and prayer and the lord he draweth nigh to him and reuealeth his will to him so if we draw neare to god by faith amp repentance by prayer and inuocation of his name then he will draw neare to vs but if we draw our selues backe from him he draweth backe from vs this then should moue vs aboue all things to seeke to draw as neare him as can be then he will come and shew his goodnesse to vs and the cause why we are so litle acquainted with his goodnesse is because we will not be acquainted with him now in the second place followeth after the fourth circumstance the parts of the vision which be two first an entrance into the vision secondly the representation of christ as he is king and priest to his church which is the substance and chiefe thing in this vision the entrance is in these words and i heard a great voice behind me till the end of the eleuenth verse the vision or the representation of christ from the twelfth to the end of the third chapter the beginning and entrance into the vision is a preparation whereby the holy ghost maketh s john more fit to receiue and marke things to be reuealed which may be heard and seene the meanes to prepare john is a voice and i heard a voice the like to this we haue commonly in the old testament where the lord reuealing his will doth send a voyce before to prepare his servant to receiue his will so when he would giue the couenant to adam gen he prepareth him to receiue and letteth him heare a voyce in the garden which made him affraid and to hide himselfe after the lord speaketh to him face to face and giueth the couenant to him so when the lord wold giue the law to moses in the mount first he sent a voice in a mightie thunder lightning and sound of a trumpet after he declared the law to him sam when the lord would speake to samuel he sendeth a voice to him three times and after he speaketh to him plainely and calleth him by his name so commonly in the old testament when the lord will declare his will to his prophets he prepareth them by a voice so to cornelius act ampc seeing the lord dealeth thus with this most famous apostle when he receiued his will by extraordinarie reuelation being first prepared then much more we which are sinfull man which haue not the thousandth part of those graces he had of knowledge faith and obedience but are so farre short in ordinarie gifts we must much more be prepared that our vnderstanding and memorie may be made fit to heare know and remember god will and word declared to vs and the cause why we increase not in faith repentance and knowledge after long hearing the word is because we come vnprepared without looking that our vnderstanding amp memorie by all good means may be prepared to receiue the word the voice is described by the place behind me not before him but behind him to stirre vp attention in him for man most marke those things which come as of a sudden behind them so this coming suddenly behind him drew him to more earnest attention a great voyce thirdly it is like the sound of a trumpet not onely a great voice but full of power and maiestie as the sound of a trumpet now he vttereth these to stirre vp more attention in him for if he should heare an ordinarie voice or a small voice it would not perhaps haue stirred him but being a great powerfull sudden and a strange voice it could not but make him very attentiue seeing he vseth all these meanes of attention in john a worthie apostle then much more must we vse all good meanes to stirre vp attention in vs seeing we in all gifts are a thousand times inferiour to the least apostle seeing we be dull and heauie and our senses not so sharpe as they shold be we must stirre vp our selues seeke to be attentiue to that which which is spoken and as lydia did we must employ all our diligence to make vs attetiue and the cause why the word is preached without fruite is because we heare it without attention and haue no affection to it now that we may do this we must beware of two enemy of attention the first are by thoughts when a man bringeth his bodie but his mind goeth about his farmes or worldly riches about a iourney or bargaine or some worldly affaires these by thoughts are thornes in our hearts which choake the good seed of the word that it cannot prosper and grow for man which are troubled with them cannot see how one point dependeth and hangeth on another but their memorie and vnderstanding is hindered the second enemie is dulnesse and heauinesse of bodie and soule which is shewed in this that we come heauie and sleepie to heare the word and spend that time which we should employ in hearing in heauinesse and sleeping but if we will haue the word fruitfull to vs we must shake off this drowsinesse be affected with ioy and gladnesse and heare the word with greedinesse if a man should come heauie and sleepie into the presence of the king especially he being to tell him of great matters or the giuing of him some great benefit he would take it for disloyaltie and contempt of his maiestie the cause why the word hath no better effect in vs but that after long preaching and teaching we be as blind and ignorant as euer we were is because we come not prepared contrarily if we come prepared the lord increaseth our faith knowledge obedience ampc saying i am alpha and omega before he described the voice which he heard as a meanes of this preparation by the place secondly the qualitie a great voice like the sound of a trumpet in these words he proceedeth further to describe this voice in this eleuenth verse amp setteth downe the substance and matter of this voice which he heard which standeth in two things the first a testimonie in these words i am alpha and omega ampc the second a commandement to write all these words ampc the testimonie in substance is in the eighth verse before in which words of christ is as before a comparison namely as alpha and omega are the first and the last letters in the greeke alphabet so i christ the son of god am the first and last of all things because before me there was nothing neither after me shall there be any thing in being and subsisting these words proue the godhead and eternitie of christ the second person the end why christ alleadgeth them is to certifie him that these things he was about to shew him came from god and therefore he bringeth his owne testimonie namely i which speake vnto thee am god therefore the things i deliuer vnto thee are from god euen from iesus christ the second person in the trinitie which am god equall to my father in this testimonie of christ note a singular care of god in respect of his church he is carefull not onely to reueale his will to his church but withal to certifie his church of the truth of the same as here he telleth john that they come from god to certifie his soule and conscience in the truth of the same so he reuealeth not onely his will but withall assureth man of the truth thereof act peter hath a vision and withall the lord assureth him of the truth of that visio and when christ preached his fathers will he wrought many miracles which were as s ales to confirme the same that it came from god seeing the lord he doth not only declare his will but withall assureth man of the certainetie and truth of his will this first confuteth the papists who teach that the word of god is certaine in it selfe but to vs it is not certaine till we heare the testimonie of the church which maketh the scripture which is vncertaine to vs though certaine in it selfe to be certaine to vs but we must here know and learne that the lord doth not onely reueale his will to his children but withall vseth meanes to certifie mens hearts of the truth thereof and so the word of god is most sure not only in it self but euen to man though the testimonie of the church shold neuer speake word of the same this confutes all carnall man there be many which will be of no religion because there is as they thinke no certaintie in religion seeing mens opinions in matters of religion be so diverse that one cannot tell who speakes the truth indeed we differ in many points of religion and so many man so many diverse opinions yet the true members of christ they differ not in the fundamentall points of religion and though all the world should differ in opinion yet it followes not there should be no religion but the doctrine taught by the prophets and apostles should stand sure and be the true religion of god for euer and the lord can make man out of it to learne his will and assure them of the certainty of religion now followeth the commaundement that which thou seest write in a book ampc this hath two parts first s john must write the things he receiueth secondly he must send them to the seuen famous churches of asia now the lord commaunds john to write these things in a booke and he must set downe that which he receiued of god to send it to the seuen churches of asia because he being now in banishment and could not come to them and be present with them to instruct them therfore he must write these in a booke that so they might be holpen by them secondly he must not only write them in a booke but send them to these seuen churches first that they might be confirmed and strengthened in the matters of faith now in the cruell time of their persecution secondly that they might keepe these books for the church of god which is the pillar amp ground of truth first because it publisheth the word secondly because she keepeth the same from time to time and also giues testimony of the truth of the same so then that these churches might keepe publish and giue testimony of these things he must send them written to them hence we learne that the word of god written is an excellent help for the church of god to edifie the same else he would neuer haue commaunded john to send this booke to the seuen churches in asia this confutes first the papists who hold that the writte word is but a dead amp inky letter a nose of waxe to be turned any way secondly the anabaptists who looke for reuelations contemne the written word but seeing the lord bids him send it to the seuen churches in asia he sheweth it is an excellent meanes to edifie the church we may learne that the reading of this booke as of other scripture is god ordinance whether it be publike or priuate and that they must be so vsed as god ordinance with reuerence and good conscience indeed the word preached is the ordinary meanes to begin faith and to worke repentance but the reading of them publikely and priuatly hath his proper vse to confirme our faith yes to increase knowledge faith and repentance in vs write and send it to the seuen churches ampc here is the third point namely that a man in the crosse and persecution may be the deare child of god s john a famous apostle and deare servant of god yet he is in banishment and continues a long time from all company of man yet god reuealeth his wil to him and maketh him the pen man of this book which he giueth to none but them which be his servant then a man may be and continue in banishment yet be the deare servant of god we reason if a man be in the crosse and persecution and continue in the same he is surely out of god fauour but we see the contrary in john in the end of the verse he setteth downe the names of these seuen churches in particular and these seuen places were seuen most famous cities in asia in which were planted seuen most excellent churches of all those parts of the world and for that cause here are named one by one then i turned backe here is his preparation or entrance into the vision when i heard a voice behind me being loud and great i turned to see him which deliuered it to me in the preparation we must consider first the meanes to moue john to attention namely a voice secondly the end to make him attentiue and to inioyne him his dutie namely to write and to send it to the churches now followeth the second part of his preparation which is that he turned backe when he heard this loud and great voice to see who it was which gaue the voice by this practise of s john we may learne our duty for as he dealeth with the man which giues the voice so must we deale with god s john heareth a voice and then he turnes backe to see who it is so must we do with the lord we are all by nature ready to turne from god and runne from him as fast as we can by our sinnes now when the lord speaketh to vs by the preaching of the word when we are running on in another way we must turne to him turne our hearts to his wayes confesse our sinnes to him that so turning to him we may haue fellowship with god for vnlesse s john had turned to see the vision and him which spake he had not seene it so vnlesse we turne to god speaking in the ministery of his word and that in time whilst he speaketh to vs we can haue no fellowship with him though we heare the word neuer so much now followeth the second part of the vision which is the representation of christ his maiesty and magnificence as he is a prophet king and priest of his church and it is set out by a large description of christ from this twelfth verse to the end of the third chapter in which description s john sheweth what he receiued touching christ partly by hearing partly by seeing and herein he describeth christ first by his place in the midst of the seuen candlestickes secondly by his forme and figure like to the son of man first he describeth christ by the place i saw seuen golden candlestickes and in the middest one like ampc these seuen candlesticks here seene of john in a vision are the seuen churches in asia now as the church of god is compared to a candlesticke as christ expoundeth it in the twentith verse so the particular churches are here called candlestickes for their resemblance which they haue with candlestickes for as their property is to beare and hold forth the candle and lamp euen so the churches of god beare vp and hold forth and publish the light of the gospell to the whole world partly by preaching and maintaining it partly by professing the faith seeing euery church is a candlesticke and not a candle to beare vp and hold forth the lamp and light of the word because they haue no light of themselues but onely can beare vp and hold foorth the light and are but the instruments of the light the true light being christ himselfe then they cannot giue light to mens consciences and hearts but all that they can do is to beare the candle and hold out the light by instructing and preaching the word and by their profession of religion in that they are compared to candlestickes we learne that all the true members of christ are candles burning and shining lights placed in the shafts of this candlesticke for though the ministers must especially be blazing lampes to the people as john baptist was ioh yet also are all true members of christ these blazing candles to hold foorth this light and shew foorth the doctrine of light to the world philipp euery man in his calling must be a shining candle and a burning lamp now that he may be such a one he must first haue knowledge of the will and word of god himselfe then as a blazing candle send foorth the same to others by teaching and instructing by godly life and conuersation we all professe we be members of christ and members of the true church then we must carie and hold foorth these burning lights hauing light in our selues to send it out to others by teaching them in our calling and liuing godly and giuing good example and so shine to the world to induce vs to this to carie our selues as burning lampes first it is the commandement of god philipp euery man in his calling must be a blazing light in the middle of a peruerse nation we must carie our selues free from all sinne send out our light to all man for a second reason marke the fruite and the effect which followeth this carying of our selues as shining lights when a man is indued with knowledge of god will and word and sends out this light by instructing others and in a godly example he winneth many man to the kingdome of heauen a man if he haue one to hold him out a candle in winter that he may see his way to go whither he would he taketh this as a great benefit how much more is this to light the way to a blind man euen to the kingdome of heauen but on the cotrarie when man be dimme and darke candles and liue not in the church as blazing lights but in sinne ignorance and loosenesse of life hence great hurt and daunger cometh to man with whom they liue for when a man knoweth the will of god and yet liueth in sin he giueth a false direction and so many follow him euen to the pit of hell and by his bad example he draweth man as much as in him lyeth to eternall destruction in hauen townes if a man remoue the night marke and the candle set to direct the ship he doth as much as in him lyeth to sinke all the ship for they hauing wrong direction runne on rockes and sands because they go to the light which is not in the right place and so they misse the channell and light on rockes and perish so man in this world they saile as on the sea to heauen now if we by our wicked life remoue the marke and giue wrong direction they must needes misse the right way and so come to a false hauen not heauen but hell and so then seeing either by our godly life we draw man to heauen or by our bad life we carie them to hell it is our dutie to labour by life and doctrine to giue good direction the third reason to moue vs to be burning lights is the iudgement of god for he which liueth in the church and yet shineth not in teaching others by his good example he incurreth the iudgement of god in the temple the lights and candles belonged to the priest who dressed and trimmed them amp for that purpose he had snuffers and such instruments now in the church euery man is a candle standing in the church as in a sticke christ iesus he is the trimmer and dresser of them he standeth in the midst of them he hath his snuffers in his hands he trimmeth them and dresseth these candles now if after three or foure times dressing and snuffing of this candle still it burneth dim and will not shine out he will either remoue it out of the sticke or else he will take and tread it vnder his feet so those which in the church do not send out a shining light the lord he dresseth and snuffeth them but if they still burne dimmely cast not a cleare light in instructing others and leauing good example the lord will cast them out of their places put them vnder his foot and cleane extinguish them in regard of this daunger euery man in his shaft and place the minister in his the vnlettered man in his must teach others giue good example else the issue will be this the lord will come in iudgement and stampe it out and extinguish that light nay very reason requireth this at our hands seeing we be all lights of this candlesticke of the church that we should send out light in winter time we hang out lights that by them man might be directed to helpe them in their iourney and shall we be so carefull to helpe man in temporall light and not much more carefull to helpe them in light toward the kingdome of god let then all ignorant and loose liuers as there be many among vs let them now begin to shine for they stand in the place of good lights they be in the candlesticke they must cease from ignorance and loosenesse of life and beginne to burne and cast light as good candles both by doctrine and good example if a man should bring a candle in a sticke to vs and we shold go about to light it twice or thrice and it would not take light we would in anger cast it downe so christ if he vse meanes to light these ignorant and loose liuing persons many times if they refuse to be lighted he in his displeasure will cast them downe out of the candlesticke and not suffer them to take the place of a good candle but rather tread and stampe them vnder foote in the church of god there be many ignorant persons many which continue in their ignorance amp rebellion and so continue in sin but a small number of good blazing lamps many hold the place of good lights but are darke dimme and giue no light let these feare god iudgements would any be true candles burning and blazing lights let them first get knowledge in the word and will of god furnish and replenish their hearts with knowledge and after practise the same faithfully in obedience in leading a godly life shining to other in holy example exhorting and instructing them that so shining foorth clearely and chearefully christ standing in the middest of the lights may like and allow of them for vnlesse we shine thus in this candlesticke to wit the church of god where we haue our places we shall neuer haue light nor ioy in the kingdome of heauen but if we do we shall then shine as the sun cleare and faire for euermore golden candlestickes that is made of gold so called for two causes the church of god is compared to a candlesticke of gold first because as gold is most excellent of all mettals so the church of god is the most excellent of all societies and company of man all company and societies of man in the familie towne citie kingdome commonweales they be all the ordinance of god and excellent in their kinds but the church of god is aboue all these it is most excellent no societie cometh neare it first because in the church there is saluation to be had and obtained but in none of these societies of man it is to be had as they be societies of man but as they be churches or true members of the church it is a most excellent societie because this is the end of all other societies they be all ordained to maintaine this as the chiefe and this euen the church of god is the end of them all the church it beautifieth and adorneth all other societies because herein is their honour and preferment in that they be either churches or members of the true church seeing the church is the chiefe and most excellent societie in this world we must aboue all things haue speciall care to become members of this societie man haue care and labour to become members of those townes which be in corporations and haue freedomes aboue other then much more should we labour to be members of that societie which is most excellent to be true members of the church of god seeing this is the chiefe societie and all referred to maintaine the church of god it must be our speciall care to maintaine that church euery man in his calling as the king prince and magistrates the ministers in their callings yes euery man in his particular calling must seeke to preserue this societie seeing this societie adorneth the other amp giueth them their beautie we should labour to bring all societies to this man in families must seeke to make their familie a church or a member of the true church they which rule a towne to make it a true member of the church and to make it an ecclesiasticall societie so kings to make their kingdome a church amp member ber of the catholike church because al other societies without the church are but as places without light and without the candlesticke to hold vp and without this light they be in darknesse and the shadow of death it is compared to a golden stick because it is most precious to god none so deare none so neare to god as this societie of the church christ therfore to expresse how deare it is saith it is a seale to his hand and a signe on his right arme can zachary cals the church the apple of god eye shewing it is most deare in god sight as precious as the apple of the eye which is most tender to vs psalm it is compared to the queene in a vesture of gold nay no societie is so precious and deare to christ as this seeing he hath shed his owne heart blood euen the blood of god to redeeme his church in the middest of the seuen golden candlestickes christ is in the midst of them that is he is present with his church continually in all times he hath continuall care of it to gather his church and being gathered to preserue it and defend it from all her enemy seeing christ is in the midst of his church present to gather and defend it then the supremacy of the church of rome whereby they will haue one head of all the churches on earth is needlesse for christ is present gathering and defending his church at all times then there needeth no generall vicar in the presence of a king they of a commission cease though they were assigned before and if any should be so impudent as to take on him the office of a king in his presence all man would condemne him so though christ had giuen this office to the pope yet seeing he is present at all times in his church to gather and defend it the generall gouernement of the pope is needlesse and it is extreame arrogancy to take on him the office of christ in his presence seeing christ is in the middest of his church we must do as enoch gen walke with or before christ when we take any thing in hand do any thing in word or deed we must do all in christs presence we must do all we do that we may haue approbation of christ for he is in the midst of his church to looke to it to defend it he seeth what we do therefore do all that he may like of it and approue it that we may do so we must haue direction for that we do out of his word and if we be able to walke before christ we shall be able to do many duties to him and be vnblameable in this wicked world the second argument whereby christ is described is his forme and shape like the son of man hence some gather that it is not christ but some angell which is described but they are deceiued for he is called and the first and the last and he that was first dead then aliue which belongs to christ alone like the son of man but more significant it is in the originall like a son of man if it be translated the son of man then christ must be vnderstood but in the originall it is a son of man according to the phrase of the old testament where when they would signifie one that was a man they called him a son of man that is man like a man in forme and shape christ is said to be like a son of man not that he appeared to john in his manhood for that was in heauen but in a likenesse appearance and resemblance of his manhood and as he doth not appeare here so in no place after his ascension he appeareth in his true manhood stephen saw the son of man stand at the right hand of god act but that was in heauen and paul heard him speake act and being rauished corinthian but then also he was in heauen and this christ doth to a speciall end to shew that whereas man much regard and esteeme his bodily presence as his apostles and friends did who had too great a desire of it we must not seeke to haue earthly familiaritie with him but we must lift vp our hearts by faith and so haue spirituall familiaritie and acquaintance with him and so he biddeth mary touch me not being not yet glorified to checke her too much desire of his bodily presence but he would haue her and vs to lift vp our hearts by faith and haue spirituall familiaritie and acquaintance with him in heauen then hence the defence of consubstantiation and reall presence of the body of chirst is in the sacrament is but needlesse seeing it is sufficient christ is present in spirit not bodily any more but we must lift vp our harts to heauen and there for euer liue and rest in him the papists gather of this in that christ appeared after his ascension in the appearance and forme of a man that they may make the image of christ who being god appeared in the forme of a man secondly the father who is figured by an old man daniel and the holy ghost in the forme of a doue they hold they may picture the not in any forme but in that they appeared answer it is not unlawful for vs to haue the pictures of the father son and holy ghost as they appeared in forme as christ in a man the father in an old man the holy ghost in a doue to illustrate and set out the history but we deny and hold it unlawful to haue any of them or the picture of christ if it were to be had to religious vses to put vs in remembrance of christ to worship god in or at or by it for thus to worship god is flat against the second commaundement clothed with a garment downe to the feete in these words following is described the garment and attire wherein christ appeared to john the first part of his attire is a long robe or garment down to the feet he appeared in this kind of garmet first to shew he was the high priest of the new testament after his ascension to do the the office of the high priest because this was one of the garments which the high priest vsed when he offered sacrifice so christ hauing offered himselfe on the crosse he is still high priest for vs to make intercession for vs to his father secondly he appeared in this kind of attire to shew he is the prince and king of peace because this long robe and garment is in all nation where it is vsed a signe of peace so christ hauing this garment is not a king of war but of peace esay thirdly to shew he excelled in wisedome and counsell for this garment in all nation which vse it was giuen to them which excell in wisedome and counsell so christ here is clothed with this long stole and robe to shew that he excelleth in the spirit of wisdome and counsell because the spirit of wisedome is in him without measure esay column hence for the attire of our body we learne that it must be sutable and answerable to those good things which be or ought to be in our hearts as this garment of christ to shew he was high priest secondly that he was king of peace lastly that he excelled in wisedome and counsell so our attire should be such which may signifie the vertues which be in vs as our knowledge obedience sobrietie temperancy humilitie and all the good gifts and graces of god we must not onely shew out the graces of our hearts by word but euen our attire must set out what they be and as we must be candles in teaching and instructing in life and conuersation so we must shine and shew forth the vertues of our heart by our attire but alas our practise is contrary for our apparell is now sutable to all our corruption and vices of our hearts to set out our pride to preach to the world our lightnesse and loosenesse of life the vanity and folly of our heart so that if a man see one go though he neuer be acquainted with him neuer spake to him yet he may know his fondnesse folly loosenesse of life pride and corruption of his heart by his apparell the second part of his attire is that he was girded about with a golden girdle about the breasts which is to shew that christ was ready prepared to do all the offices of a mediator for vs for the girding vp of the body the binding of mens apparell to them is a signe of diligence and care to do ones dutie as the not girding of the cloth but to leaue the loose is a signe of negligece and carelesnesse then seeing christ is girded vp it sheweth he is ready prepared to do the office of a mediator to all man and so christ whilest he was on the earth he shewed this he saued all the poore sinners which came to him and since his resurrection he is not negligent but ready prepared girded to do the office of a mediator to all true penitent sinners this must be a singular comfort to all which haue any sparke of grace that christ he is ready to attend on them to do the office of a mediator for them when we be in affliction amp crosse he is ready prepared at our elbowes to deliuer vs and comfort vs when we be ready to die he is not farre off but stands by vs ready to cary our soules to heauen in all things he is ready to all the workes of a mediator to helpe vs in all the workes of our saluation christ he is not like pharaohs butler who promised ioseph to remember him being promoted to honour out of prison but after being exalted in pharaohs house forgot him gen but christ he is still now as readie as euer he was in earth to helpe vs and to do all the workes of a mediator for vs then we must imitate christ and haue our loines girded vp luke we must be prepared and made readie to do all our duties to call vpon the name of god to giue him thankes to renew our faith and repentance daily yes euery day make our selues readie to die or to liue and to be alwaies readie to do all the workes concerning our saluation and at all times to carie our selues so as we be readie to enter into heauen at any time but we neuer thinke of this we are readie to no good thing we neuer thinke of death till it knocke at the doore oh let vs labor to become good followers of christ hauing our loynes girded vp readie prepared to all good workes about the paps not the belly but breast some thinke and not vnfitly to shew that his thoughts and affections which came from the heart they be most perfect ranged in not subiect to any sinne but guided by the spirit which with full measure dwelleth in him bodily and his head as white as wooll now s john describeth christ by the parts of his bodie first his head is as white as wooll or snow which is to shew the eternitie of christ for though as he was man he had a beginning yet as he is god he is eternall he is the auncient of dayes daniel and when all things began he was before seeing our sauiour christ vseth this hoarinesse and whitenes of the old gray head to set out his eternitie and euer being he would shew the excellencie and honor of aged man of the old gray headed man which other younger want and for this he compareth the old gray head to almond trees which are alwaies white ecclesiastes and prou it is compared to a siluer crowne not made by man but made and placed by the hand of god on the aged mans head this excellencie of the hoarie head is in this that he beareth in his person the image of god eternitie before all younger man he standeth in the roome of god to shew god eternitie to man namely in this old and white head of his now seeing the aged man hath this excellencie aboue young man he must be reuerenced young man must rise to him leuit and we must in their hoarie head learne the image of god eternitie they which be such which in regard of their age haue this excellencie aboue others they must excell others in knowledge and experience in wisdome and holinesse ioh i write to you fathers which know the father which hath bene from the beginning shewing he taketh it for granted that aged man which be fathers should haue knowledge in the will of god secondly they must exceed others in holinesse of life god is holy they beare his image therefore they must seeing they beare his image aboue others go before yong man in holinesse and therefore salomon prou compareth old age to a siluer crowne ioyned with righteousnesse which when they be ioyned together old age indeed is a glorious ornament then man must take heed that old age be no disgrace vnto them nor dishonour but an ornament and commendation but alas miserable is our dayes when young man excell old in knowledge and wisdome in godlinesse of life and conuersatio and other gifts of the spirit but it should not be so but as the aged must go before them in preferment and excellencie so they should go before them in wisdome knowledge experience and godlinesse and if in these which weare the siluer crowne on their heads there be found sinnes abounding and loosenesse of life it is much more dishonor in them then the younger though in neither commendable and it is not enough for old man to say their memorie conceipt and knowledge faile them for this sheweth they haue liued a bad and loose life and mis spent their younger age but they must labour that with their siluer crowne on their head they may haue a siluer life in heart and hand and his eyes were as a flame of fire s john goeth on to describe christ in vision by the parts of his bodie now in handling these parts though no man can set downe certainly what the holy ghost intendeth in euery point yet we must consider what is most probable in the word of god and his eyes ampc he addeth these to signifie two things first to shew that our mediator is of a most piercing sharpe and quicke sight so that he beholdeth all things in earth euen the secrets of our hearts for he hath fierie and piercing eyes and as fire entreth and pierceth all mettals so christ by his fierie eye pierceth into the substance and secrets of the hearts now it is necessarie that the head of the church should be so sharpe of sight that he might behold the whole church see all the enterprise of the diuell and the estate of all his children seeing christ is of so piercing and fierie a sight that he seeth the very secrets and thoughts of our hearts we must haue care not onely of our words and actions but of ordering our thoughts and affections for christ pierceth into our hearts and seeth them therefore we must looke they be in order that he may approue them it is true thoughts and inward affections with man beare no action because man know not the heart and affections but it is not so with god he seeth the least inclination and purpose of our hearts and he keepeth court of iudgement not onely for words and actions but for thoughts and affections therefore man must take heed they be well ordered and so of christ approued that for the they be not condemned christ he seeth our hearts and our very inclinations then we must in matters of religion be indeed that we seeme to be for though we can bleare mens eyes with outward profession and they can go no further yet the lord he hath fierie and piercing eyes and seeth our hearts and how we be but hypocrites if we be not indeed that we seeme outwardly to be yet man must stay and suspend their rash iudgement and not for the professing of religion iudge man to be hypocrites for god alone searcheth their hearts secondly he is thus described to shew he is full of anger and iudgement and readie to take vengeance of his enemy that is of them which will not giue themselues and turne to him by repentance in obeying his will and word for though christ be a redeemer and sauiour yet he is also a iudge amp in indignation will execute his iudgement on his enemy euen vpon all that refuse to haue him to rule ouer them as he saith those mine enemy which would not haue me to rule ouer them bring them that i may kill them this may serue to awake many drowsie and secure professors for man now in this barren age liue in sinne and ignorance neuer thinke of the duties of faith and repentance take pleasure in sinne it is meate and drinke to them to liue in securitie not one of a thousand turneth to god by heartie repentance let these know that though they liue closely in sin yet christ beholdeth them not as a redeemer but as a iudge with fierie and piercing eyes readie to execute iudgement on them for their sinnes they then must consider their owne estate in time and turne to god lest that they going on in their sinnes and snorting in securitie christ come vnawares and cut them off in his anger for it is a fearefull thing to fall into the hands of god and his feet like to fine brasse the word signifieth brasse which is shining for substance durable amp pure the very choice and excellentest kind of brasse this he addeth to signifie the inuincible power of christ that he is able to encounter nay hath alreadie encountred with sinne and satan wounded them and bruised their heads to powder for his feete are strong and durable he is of power to ouercome his enemy to tread them vnderfoot and grind them to powder and not onely in his owne person but in his members he is most powerfull seeing he hath brasen feet strong and durable to ouercome his enemy and tread them vnderfoot this is a singular comfort to the children of god who if they be exercised with any temptation of satan or with any affliction and griefe they must not be discouraged but seeke to christ their head he will in vs as he hath before in his owne person bruise the serpents head and breake it to powder let vs then put our cause to christ and let him haue the whole ordering and dispensation of it so if sin and corruption hang on vs vexe and oppresse vs we must flie to him make him acquainted with it seeke helpe from him and we shall doubtlesse find it weakened and wounded nay bruised to peeces by his helpe if we see the terror of death we must not feare too much for christ is strong and able to ouercome death nay he encountred with sinne and satan on the crosse ouercame him there and went downe with him to his owne denne and cabine and there vanquished death so that he hath subdued and brought him vnder foote and made him his footstoole and as this is a comfort to the godly so it should be a terror to the wicked who without repenting liue in their sinnes for christ hath a foote of brasse he wil bruise them in peeces make them his foote stoole and with his brazen foot grind them to powder then they which be as yet enemy to christ must turne to him leaue their old maister satan come to him else he will breake them to nothing by his strong and brasen foote burning as in a fornace the feete of god as of man in the scriptures often signifie his or their wayes so here the feet of christ signifie his wayes or workes burning as in a fornace this sheweth the perfection of christs wayes they be vncorrupt euen as brasse purified in the fire so be they most pure most vnspotted without all drosse all his wayes his counsels and works either of creation or preseruation all are without fault the way of god is vncorrupt the word of the lord is tried in the fire he is a shield to all that trust in him psalm seeing all his wayes are pure and most holy we must speake and thinke of them with reuerence euen of his secret iudgements whereof we know no cause nor reason we must reuerence them and aknowledge that they are pure of themselues in matters of religion there is a learned ignorance whereof this is not the least point to content our selues with his wayes and not curiously to search into those things which he hath not reuealed in his word but though they be against reason to man acknowledge them as holy amp true with reuerence for all christs waies be holy the blind man cannot iudge of the light because he seeth it not no more can blind man such as all be iudge of workes hidden with god the lord bids abimelech giue sarah to abraham else he wil punish him and all his what reason is this in mans sight nay it seemeth cruelty to punish his servant for him so achan he sinned ios and the people are plagued dauid sinned sam the child died and he sinned againe sam the people is plagued what reason can ma giue of these these seeme al contrary to reason in mans iudgement but we must reuerence the counsels of god as good pure and holy though we see no cause at all of them the lord hath determined to saue some to cast off other some now this seemeth crueltie to man nay some hold it an action of crueltie that the lord should withhold his mercy from one and shew it to another but they sinne seeing it is the doctrine of god word that he in his good will and pleasure hath determined to saue some to reiect other for his owne pleasure though we see no reason at all of this we must reuerence it and hold it the truth of god most holy counsell and his voice as the sound of many water this he addeth for two causes first to shew the loudnesse and greatnes of his voice because this voice of christ in his word hath gone through the whole world for the doctrine of christ hath bene sounded in all parts of the world secondly to shew the power force and efficacy of this voice in the eares of his creatures christ before all things were but spake the word and at his word all things were made lazarus lay rotting in his graue yet he heard the voice of christ as of a thousand trumpets sounding in his eares and rose vp nay the body of man being dead sixe thousand yeares euen those shal heare the voice of christ being a loud and great voice a powerfull and effectnall voice seeing this voice of christ is so loud and powerfull a voice that the dead are able to heare it this shewes the securitie and deadnesse of those man which though they heare it dayly sounding and crying in their eares as the noise of many water yet they will not as did the dead bodie of lazarus heare and stand vp and come forth of their graues of sinne but still snort in securitie and rot in their sinnes this argueth our great drowsines that the dead which haue layne six thousand yeares shall at this voice rise and awake and we hearing it both loud and powerfull and publike in our eares will not put vp our head nor our heart not seeke to get one foot out of the graue of sinne and securitie and he had here s john describeth him by his parts and the properties of euery part in his right hand seuen starres that is seuen angels seuen ministers of the seuen churches of asia the ministers are compared to starres first because as starres send out light to man on earth so the ministers ought to giue light to man euen spirituall light by doctrine taught by them and by conuersatio of life among them secondly they be compared to stars because as the stars haue their continuall abode in heauen neuer descend downe so the ministers of the word especially should haue their conuersation in heauen it is the dutie of all but more specially of the ministers in regard of their callings first by seeking their owne saluation secondly by seeking the saluation of others by which two they must haue their conuersation in heaue though they haue their body in earth thirdly because they shall be honoured of god in heauen as the starres for daniel they which do their dutie they shall shine like starres in the firmament they be in christs right hand that is all regiment and gouernement in matters of the church belongs to christ he alone hath the whole disposition and ordering of the ministery seeing he alone is head of the church and the ministers they be in his right hand he rules and raignes in his church he careth for it and looketh to it seeing these starres be in christs right hand this shewes that the choosing amp furnishing of the ministers of the word belongs to christ ephesians he giueth them their gifts and places then we ought in this last age to pray the lord to send out laborers into his haruest that so his children might be gathered and an end made of these miserable dayes he holds these seuen starres in his right hand whereby we see he giueth them defence and protection so long as they be faithful in their callings he carieth them in his right hand amp though they haue sundry discouragements yet seeing christ he ordereth their ministery and disposeth of it if they be faithfull nothing should hinder their course nothing should cut them off from their duty neither the want of obediece in them to whom they preach and labour not seeing that fruit they should nor the iniuries of the enemy of their profession nor any thing else seeing they be in his right hand this sheweth the excellency of this calling of the ministery idle man esteeme it most base amp accept of it as of a meane calling and so discourage many but in the sight of god it is an high and holy calling he carieth them in his right hand defends them and protects them now what greater glory can there be then that they should be so honored to be borne and caried in the right hand of the king of heauen and earth though wicked man dishonour them esteeme so basely of the this should stir those who haue good gifts to get this high and holy calling thus to be honoured of christ they must be vnblameable for seeing christ carieth them in his right hand he will hold nothing but that which is holy and pure as he is but if it be defiled sinfull and wicked he will take it out of his right hand put it vnder his brazen foote and grind it to peeces and the more he had honoured them the more will he dishonour them by the same reason the hearers are bound to profit else they must drinke of the same cup for if the ministers be punished for not preaching then they for not hearing and out of his mouth ampc in these words he describes him by the two last parts of his body his mouth and his face and in his mouth was a two edged sword ampc by this two edged sword is meant the doctrine of the law and the gospel vttered and propounded by the prophets and apostles and this two edged sword is described heb it is mightie in operation ampc the doctrine of the law and the gospell is compared to a two edged sword because as a sword with a double edge enters not onely into the flesh but to the bones yes euen to the marrow so the word preached it enters into the heart deepely to the diuiding of the spirits yes it enters to the very bottome of the heart it searcheth euery nooke and corner which is most secret the word hath a double operation one in the wicked another in the godly in the wicked this sharpe two edged sword of the word it wounds them at the heart with a deadly wound and so by the same wound brings them to eternall death isaiah he shall with his breath that is the sword of his word slay the wicked this is that sword that hath and will kill antichrist ob but how cometh it that the word of god should wound or kill any how should it slay a wicked and vnrepentant sinner answer we must know there be three degrees of spirituall death the first is the separation of bodie and soule when the bodie is laid in the graue the soule conueyed to the place of torments the second is when a sinner in this life by the word is wounded and smitten and so receiueth in his heart a deadly wound the third degree is at the end of this life at the last iudgement whe soule and bodie shall go into hell fire for euen a sinner receiueth his deadly wound in this life which is the first steppe to hell and eternall death in the life to come in the inflicting and giuing of this wound there be three actions of christ required which he worketh in the hearts of the wicked by the doctrine of the law and the gospell the first is to reueale to them their sinnes all their pride rebellion hypocrisie the damnable corruptions of their hearts and all their sinnes against the first and second table corinthian if in the church all prophecie there come in one which beleeueth not he is rebuked of all because they iudge him an hypocrite and so the secrets and corruptions of his heart are laid open and discouered by the word preached the second action of christ is this he after reuealeth to them the wrath and curse of god against sinne his indignation against the breakers of the law and for this cause the law is called the killing law because it sheweth iudgement without mercie for the transgressions of the law thirdly christ by the word preached sharpeneth the sting of conscience maketh it awake and terrifieth a man when he heareth or remembreth the word and the curse denounced against sinners so felix when paul preached to him of iustice and temperancie he fainted and trembled the word was a two edged sword of the spirit to wound his conscience with terrour and feare so daniel beltashar seeing but an hand writing he quaketh for feare the word of god came into his mind and made his conscience accuse him and his knees smote together for feare so then by this we see how christ killeth the wicked by reuealing their sinnes shewing the wrath and anger of god against sinne and sinners which repent not and the curse of the law and also by sharpning the sting of conscience to wound them and strike them at the heart and so they by this haue the first wound of eternall death though the lord may in mercie recouer them of this wound yet of themselues they be in the estate of death and vnlesse they repent they are in the first step to eternall death for those horrors and feares which come into a mans heart in regard of god wrath and iudgements seuered from grace are no grace but the first wound to eternall death vnlesse the lord giue grace seeing christ carieth the two edged sword of the spirit in his mouth whereby he woundeth his enemy with a deadly wound at the heart then when we see any which cometh to heare the word and after rebelleth stormeth and rageth against the same being wounded in conscience therewith we must not be displeased with it but pitie his case seeing he is wounded at the heart with a deadly wound and he in this case is in the first steppe to eternall death vnlesse the lord recouer him of this wound in those churches and places where the word hath bene long preached and the people remaine in blindnesse and ignorance and vnreformed we must in these take pitie on them seeing this is a heauie iudgement of god on them for these are wounded with a deadly wound by the sword of the spirit because the word hath bene long and often preached to them without profit and the word it neuer returneth emptie but either saueth or destroyeth woundeth or healeth them so that though man may liue ciuilly before man making a faire shew yet if they be vnreformed and liue in ignorance these are but dead man in the sight of god the word hath giuen them the first deadly wound therefore we must pitie their estate if we come into the field see an hundred man lye wounded and gushing out bloud some in the head some in the sides and some in the feet we cannot but be exceedingly moued so in the church of god many are vnreformed in obedience and repentance and though we cannot see their bloudie wounds with bodily eyes yet we may see them lye wallowing in the bloud of ignorance and securitie of impenitencie and wickednesse therefore we must pitie their estate for they be dead man indeed seeing they be not reuiued by the word in reformation of life and obedience for the word either quickeneth or killeth seeing the word without grace killeth we must not content our selues with it but seeke to feele the worke of the spirit peace of conscience and reformation of life by the word let vs then by a liuely faith labour to apply christ by the word to lay hold on him and his righteousnesse so that we can say we liue not but christ in vs but this word hath another action in the elect children of god which though it be manifold yet all tend to further and procure their saluation the first work of it in these is to wound deepely and to kill the corruptio of mans nature in his heart with a deadly wound that it neuer recouer againe yet though it wound a man it killeth not the person as in the wicked but onely the corruption of his heart and quickeneth the person to christ killeth him in regard of rebellion and vnbeleefe we are sacrifices to be offered to god therefore we must be killed not in our body and soules but in our corruptions affections and rebellions that we may be killed the two edged sword of the spirit is required which giueth our corruption the deadly wound and cutteth vp the root since the second action after our conuersion amp change is this the word of god must cut and pare the remnants of our corruption by lessening and weakening of it daily ioh as the husbandman cutteth loppeth and pareth off all branches that beare no fruite so the word of god cutteth and pareth away the remnants of corruptions in our hearts that so our hearts may bring foorth more fruite thirdly the word of god serueth to keepe his people and children in awe and subiection and therefore christ holdeth the scepter of the word in his mouth that though the wicked will not be kept in awe yet his elect may tremble and feare at the lifting vp of the same amongst man if many be fighting let the magistrate but hold vp the sword of iustice euery man yeeldeth and putteth his sword into his sheath and shall not we much more cease from sinne and feare when christ the king of heauen and earth holdeth out the scepter of his word and if any refuse to be subiect and to obey the magistrate he is counted a rebell if man refuse to obey the scepter of christ shall they not be so accounted so then by these actions we see the power of the word it killeth corruptions in our hearts pareth it and the remnants of it and it keepeth man in awe and subiection yet it differeth in the wicked and in the godly in the wicked it maketh them feare and woundeth them to death destroying both soule and bodie in the godly it woundeth them indeed not in their persons but in the corruptions of their hearts it maketh vs fit to encounter with the diuell and to vanquish him in all his temptations if it be vsed with knowledge seeing the word of god serueth to kill our corruptions we when we heare the word must receiue and beleeue the same not onely when it is deliuered in generall but applyed in particular though it touch vs and wound our hearts we must suffer it and reioyce in it for that is the first steppe to health to haue our corruptions ripped vp and touched when the sword of the spirit entreth to our hearts it will ransacke euery nooke and secret corner then we must reioyce in this blessing of god suffer it gladly seeing it is the onely meanes to come to life if one be sicke of a fistula he will suffer the surgeon to rippe and launce him to search euery part of the wound and shall not we suffer the phisition of the word to display to lay open to ransacke and search the corruption of our hearts seeing that is the onely way to recouer health for we cannot liue to god till we die to our selues and to our sinnes we cannot p ssibly die to our sinnes till our corruptions be destroyed and all our sinnes killed and wounded to death in his mouth other kings carie their scepter in their hands but he in his mouth to shew that no doctrine must be receiued of vs vnlesse it proceed from his mouth for he receiued his fathers will deliuereth it to his church to his prophets and apostles and they to vs and his face shone ampc for as the sun is to the world so is christ to his church now as the sun performeth two duties to man so doth christ the first is to giue light and driue away darkenesse to take away the night and bring the day so christ he is the sun of righteousnesse malach he giueth the light of knowledge to his servant he sendeth the light of the word which can dispel darknes and enlighten his people in the knowledge of his will and word then are we bound to labour aboue al things for knowledge of his will and word first when the day dawneth we set open our doores and windowes to receiue the light and comfort of the same now christ is in the midst of his church he sendeth light he shineth clearely being the son of righteousnes then we must open the doores of our hearts and the windows of our soules and consciences to receiue his light and comfort into vs seeing christ giueth light by his word we must in all our life be guided and directed by that light we are pilgrimes going through a vale of misery and darknes christ is the light he shineth as a blazing torch we must then do all our duties by direction of this light we must in all our wayes haue our eyes fixed in this word which is the son of light and direction the action of the sun is to warme and comfort dead and cold body and to reuiue them as we see in the spring time it reuiues those creatures which before were as dead with cold so christ giueth not onely light but life he giueth spiritual comfort to body frozen for cold he comforts them amp reuiues them by his spirituall heate and for this is called the sun of righteousnesse comforting our cold and frozen hearts in sinne and iniquitie then we must labour aboue all things to be partakers of this spirituall life and comfort which cometh by the spirituall heate of christ as man will in winter go into the sun to feele the heate of the beames so must we come out of our sinnes get into the sun shine of christ that his beames may streame vpon vs plenteously to haue life conueyed to our benummed and dead consciences we will seeke to haue honour riches preferments and pleasures of this life but psalm we should desire the sun of righteousnesse to shine on vs with the beames of mercy to haue him quicken our dead hearts with the heate of his holy spirit that we may haue this spiritual life we must die our selues ere we ca liue to the lord we must first be killed ere we be made aliue if we wold liue to god we must suffer the two edged sword to pierce to the heart to cut vp and cut off all our corruptions to suffer it to enter into vs to ransack our rebellious harts and to be thrust to the hilts that so it may diuide betweene the spirit amp the flesh pare off al the rotte flesh of corruptio in vs for when we are killed to our selues amp discouraged in regard of our own sins we are most fit to be made aliue to god a body which is almost dead for cold is the most capable of heate and when we are thus cast downe in regard of our sins then we must labor to haue the comfortable beames of christ to shine in our hearts to warme and to quicken vs and his fauourable countenance to shine on vs which if we haue though we haue neither honour riches nor preferment yet we haue enough and if we want that heate all things else are nothing the third worke or action of the sun is to discouer all things in the night nothing appeareth all haue one forme but when the sun cometh with his light all things appeare and a man may in the beames see the very motes so christ the chiefe sun seeth all things and he will discouer all nothing so secret which is hid from him nothing so close which his eye seeth not he knoweth and he can and will discouer all mens actions yes their secret thoughts seeing christ knoweth all our thoughts so as he can make the manifest and open note that though we may liue so as man cannot iudge of our hypocrisie yet christ seeth our dealings amp as the sun is manifest to our eye so our actions are cleare to his eye this should make vs take heed to all our waies and workes that we do or thinke nothing but as in his presence for we cannot blind his eyes but he seeth it euen as clearely as we see the light of the sun if man of occupations would consider this that all their actions are cleare to christ they would not commit so much crueltie and iniustice there would not be so many sins practised of vs dayly as there are and when i saw him i fel at his feet as dead in these seuenteenth amp eighteenth verses john proceeds to describe our sauior christ as god gaue him a vision by other arguments that is by his actions the first action is contained in these seuenteenth and verses which is a confirmation of s john being greatly afraid and this confirmation is the whole matter and substance of these two verses in this note two things first the occasion secondly the meanes the occasion mouing christ to confirme s john in the second part of the seuenteenth verse the meanes in the end of the seuenteenth verse amp in the eighteenth the occasion was an exceeding feare of death which made john as dead as appeareth by christs comforting of him in this feare note things first the cause secondly the effect of it thirdly the kind of feare the cause in these words and when i saw him ampc which was the appearance of christ to john in his maiestie and glory which made john exceedingly feare s john seeing the maiestie and glory of christ he is exceedingly afraid and astonished as a dead ma we all by nature since the fall of adam are fearefull sinners before he fell he walked amp talked with god face to face but after his fall he fled and hid himselfe he could not brooke his presence because he had sinned and since his fall mans frailtie and weaknes is such that he cannot abide the presence and maiestie of god but as manoah iudg seeing an angell of god said we shall surely die because we haue seene god shewing that the presence of god of his maiestie is terrible to sinfull man euen so it is with all man now seeing we haue lost our first estate we must labor continually to haue the image of satan abolished in vs and the image of god daily renewed we must become new creatures amp seeke aboue all things to haue our former fellowship with god which we lost in adam for in this fellowship with god stands all true happinesse and ioy eternall seeing it feared john that he was as dead we see that the feeling of the presence of god of his maiestie and glory it is a singular meanes to humble man to cast him downe and make him know he is nothing in himselfe so soone as john perceiued and saw the presence of christ he was as dead amp fell at his feete so abraham the more he perceiued the glory of god the more he humbled himselfe confessing he was dust and ashes and peter luke seeing but a glimmering of christs maiestie and might he bids him depart fro him he was a sinner so isaiah the angels couer theselues with their wings with three they couered their face and with their feet as fearing and not able to behold his maiesty as cofessing they be nothing but sin in theselues we see the great goodnes of god in the ministery of his word for though he might speake to vs by his own self and so that we could not abide to heare his voice but should be as dead man yet he in mercy speaketh to vs by sinfull man like to our selues and familarly then we must know and learne to acknowledge his mercy and be thankfull for it seeing it astonished s john we see that euen holy and righteous man cannot abide the presence of christ his maiestie and glory much lesse can the works of righteous man stand before his iust iudgement or answer to his iustice for the person must be first accepted before the worke can be accepted now if a righteous man cannot abide the presence of christ no more can his worke then damnable is the doctrine of the church of rome who will haue man to stand at god bar and bring their workes as part of their iustification but our workes be but in part holy no more then we be our selues but in part iust now followeth the effect of this feare in s iohns body he fel at his feete as dead it was not a small but a great feare which astonished his senses made him as a dead man phisitions say that the mind followeth the constitution and temperature of the body but we may here as truly say the body followeth the temperature and constitution of the mind for the mind can worke that on the body which other diseases can worke it can cast man into a swound make the body cold and many other things which diseases work in the body so ahab being grieued and fearing he could not get naboths vineyard was sick and almost dead so then affections of loue and feare and hatred ampc can change amp kill the body therfore the body followeth the teperature and constitution of the mind againe we see diseases are not alwayes to be cured by article and phisicke but often when phisicke cannot helpe the body is cured by ordering and composing the affections of the heart seeing these can order and dispose the body and change it as their nature is the in the next place followeth the kind of feare i fel at his feet as dead ampc shewing it was a godly amp religious reuerence in the heart of john for this kind of prostrating the body is a signe of godly reuerence and religious feare we must learne by this example to cast downe our selues in the presence of christ as john did and to lie prostrate at his feet ob but some may say christ is not present we cannot now fall at his feet seeing he is in heauen answer though christ be now in heauen yet he hath his footstoole on earth and his feet may be said to be here on earth for the mercie seate that was a signe of god presence though that be taken away god hath yet his footstoole on earth psalm for wheresoeuer the church of god is assembled to pray vnto him there is christ truly present and there is his footstoole and there should we cast downe our selues our soules and body to christ he being there present now though s iohns feare be a godly feare yet it is stained with sin for it is ioyned with immoderate feare of death then we see that the most holy affections of righteous man they haue their imperfections they be stained with sinne because they be sanctified but in part and in part be corrupt and there is no man which hath true filiall feare but he hath withall a seruile feare of hell and damnation the meanes follow whereby christ confirmeth john then he laid his right hand in this note two things first when he vseth this meanes secondly the meanes it selfe the time when then that is after christ by his presence had smitten him cast him downe and laid him as dead then he vseth meanes of confirmation and comfort and this is god practise first to humble a man and cast him downe breake him and bruise him to powder then he hauing made him plyable and fit to receiue grace after confirmeth and comforteth him in the matter of saluation secondly a man must be wounded then haue oyle powred in and he must be a lost sheepe after christ will bring him home againe and this is the cause why so few profit by the word preached and by the sacraments because they be not first humbled and cast downe and made fit to receiue christ comfortably offer himselfe in the gospell now follow the meanes themselues which are two the first a signe then he laid his right hand ampc secondly his word saying feare not ampc there is not one of them vsed a part neither the signe nor the word alone but he vseth both meanes more to confirme and comfort s john so the lord dealt with moses exod he first giueth him the word i will be with thee to comfort thee and not onely that but the signe he must offer sacrifice to god as a signe so to ahaz though a wicked king he giueth him his word to comfort and confirme him and verse he biddeth him aske a signe of him so christ preached the gospell there is his word and confirmeth the same by miracles now he giueth vs promises of eternall life and not onely that but addeth signes and seales to confirme them namely his sacraments by this we see that christ hath exceeding care of his children and of his church seeing he vseth al meanes to confirme them and to comfort them he giueth them not onely his word which might be sufficient but for our weaknesse he addeth signes to confirme vs condescending thus to our capacitie to take from vs all doubtings and to giue vs assurance euen out of the maner of vsing the meanes as here first he vseth the signe the word then he putteth his hand on john to assure him of his protection and after biddeth him not to feare by this order we see that the very assurance of god presence and protection is a present remedie against all feare of death and desperation if a man be assured of god presence aide and helpe he needeth not to feare so moses being affraid to go before the people the lord to cofort him exod telleth him he will be with him and dauid considering god protected him saith psalm he would not feare though he were in the shadow of death then it is our dutie to labour to haue the assurance of god protection and assistance which will stay vs against all immoderate feare of death now after this he addeth reasons to confirme his owne words to john when his word might haue serued alone the first reason is in the end of the verse i am the first and the last he is the first because nothing was or can be before him and the last because nothing is or can be after christ and he addeth these two phrases to shew his godhead and eternitie and that christ alone hath in his hands the beginning and end of all things all things haue their beginnings of him he of nothing but he giueth the beginning to all things and he alone putteth the end to all things now seeing he hath power to giue beginning and end therefore he can preserue his servant from death he can keepe them from condemnation and he hauing power to begin and end all things can giue and begin his promises can end and accomplish the same at his pleasure and am aliue or he that liueth but was dead in these words is the second reason which christ alleageth to proue his former words and to make john not to feare death too much the reason consisteth in a distinction thus although i was dead yet now i am he which liueth i haue power of death of hell ampc this distinction hath three parts first though i was dead yet now i liue secondly i liue for euer thirdly i haue power of death and the keyes of hell ampc and i am he which liueth here life is ascribed to christ in a speciall maner that is he liueth not as all other creatures liue but in a more peculiar maner of liuing christ vseth this phrase i am he that liueth first to shew he hath life in himselfe secondly that he giueth life to others first he hath sufficient life in of and from himselfe which appeareth thus life is two fold vncreated or created vncreated as the life of god which is infinite eternall in and of it selfe sufficient now christ as he is god he liueth by this vncreated life which is all one with his godhead secondly there is a created life which is twofold first naturall preserued by meate and drinke secondly spirituall which is by immediate fellowship with god when we liue by the immediate operation of god spirit not by meat and drinke and christ he liueth this spirituall life so that he liueth first by an vncreated life as he is god secondly he liueth a spirituall life his bodie and soule being sustained in the second person of the trinitie therefore he hath in himselfe most absolute and perfect life and he giueth life to others two wayes first as he is god and so he giueth life to all man good and bad he is the author life in all things which liue in him we liue moue and haue our being he giueth life and he preserueth the same secondly he giueth spirituall life to his church and children as he is redeemer of mankind he liueth that we might liue by him ioh and as he died not for himselfe alone so he liueth not for himselfe alone but for vs that we by him might haue spirituall life as appeareth colos our life is hid with god in christ and for this cause thogh christ be in heauen yet we eate his bodie and drinke his bloud really in a spirituall maner and they be the spirituall nourishment of our soules we liue by the spirituall life of christ and that for these two causes first because he hath sufficient life in himselfe and secondly because he giueth life to others therefore he saith i am he which liueth seeing christ giueth this spirituall life we must seeke it at him and labour that we may say that we liue not but christ in vs and that our life is hid in christ for christ he liueth spiritually that he might bring spirituall life to vs then we must labour to haue this we can be content to seeke farre and neare to take exceeding paines to get gaine to maintaine this our momentanie amp earthly life which is but as grasse yes as a fleeting shadow and as a span and shall we not be much more carefull to get spirituall life which lasteth for euer but the practise of man is cleane contrarie not one of a thousand laboureth for spirituall life but all are bewitched with the ouer greedie desire of things of this life ampc the reason of this is because mens hearts are not touched with the burthen of sinne and the curse of god on vs for sinne and therefore it is that no man seeketh to be deliuered from sinne to haue this spirituall life with christ our head this we may see in that woman john christ telleth her he is the bread of life she beginneth to cauill with him but when he toucheth her speciall sinne then she hearkeneth to him so if the ministers tel the people of matters of saluation vnlesse they first cast them downe amp make them see their sins they will but quarrell and cauill at it and the doctrine of the gospell christ is the water nay the well of life now we must be thirstie and parched with thirst and then we will seeke for water and we must not onely lightly tast but seeke to be dipped and diued in this fountaine to haue our soules sowsed and soaked in this water and if we could know that christ liued in vs and we in him by spirituall life it would be a present remedy against all persecutions and behold i liue for euer amen here followeth the second part of the distinction namely though i was dead yet now i liue for euer which second part of the distinction is propounded with two notes the first of certaintie amen to assure vs that that which christ auoucheth before of himselfe is vnfalliblie true the second note is of attention behold this serueth to stir vp attention in john and in vs to a serious and due consideration of that part of the distinction i liue for euer therfore christ saith behold behold i liue here note two things first in regard of what nature christ liueth for euer to what end he liueth for euer as he is the mediator of the church ergo in regard of both natures as he is god amp man in regard of his godhead he liueth for euer by the vncreated or essentiall life of god which is all one with his godhead which is for euer of it selfe not by any other secondly he liueth for euer in respect of his manhood for after he ascended into heauen there he liueth in glorie with the father and holy ghost because in the manhood of christ dwelleth the power of the godhead bodily colos the second thing is why he liueth for euer namely that he might giue eternall life to his church and all his true members god giueth vs eternall life by his son ioh and this is the ground of all ioy this that christ liueth to giue vs eternall life is the foundation of the church and the ground of our happinesse we must then consider of christ as a roote he liueth not for himselfe as a roote doth not liue for it selfe but to giue life to all the branches and true members of the church and we must consider of the manhood of christ as a common treasurie or storehouse of eternall happinesse therefore john christ saith my flesh is meat indeed and he which eateth his flesh and drinketh his bloud shall liue for euer shewing that his flesh and manhood hath power to giue life and quicken his true members yet not as considered in it selfe but as the same is ioyned with the godhead and is the manhood of god and the flesh of god for it hath all this power from god the meanes whereby he giueth eternall life is the mysticall coniunction betweene him amp his members first god the father giueth christ to the church and euery true member of the same as he hath promised to giue him now he giueth him as he is mediator of the church euen whole christ yet the godhead of christ is not giuen of the father but onely by the operation thereof in the manhood whereby the manhood is made able to satisfie god iustice but the manhood of christ that is really giuen his very substance his flesh and bloud is really giuen to euery beleeuer and the benefits of the manhood also are truly giuen vs as righteousnesse and life eternall as really as lands or goods are giuen to man now to whom christ is giuen with him god giueth the spirit of christ for christ and his spirit come together and this spirit createth in the heart of a man the instrument of faith by which christ giuen of god is receiued of vs and we by faith apprehend his bodie and bloud and the merits thereof and we receiue not christ in imagination or in our braine but euen as god the father giueth him in the word and sacraments really and truly and as the spirit of christ createth in vs faith so it knitteth vs also to christ our head really though mystically now from this mysticall coniunction betweene christ the head and vs the members proceedeth eternall life thus first he which is ioyned and knit to christ in this life and receiueth him he beginneth by this coniunction to liue an eternall life in dying to all his sins and to liue to god to liue as christ liueth a spirituall life and this i may call the first benefit of our spiritual vnion with christ secondly man thus vnited shall rise to glorie in his bodie and so the second fruite of this mysticall coniunction with christ is the resurrection of the bodie for this coniunction with christ after it is begunne it is perpetuall it is neuer broken so that though a man lie in his graue many thousand yeares yet he is the vnited to christ is in the graue a meber of christ amp by vertue of this mysticall vnion he shall be raised at the last day as we see the sappe of trees in winter time is in the roote and the branches seeme to die but in the spring when the heate of the sun cometh then it creepeth out into the branches and they bud and bring foorth fruite so man hath his winter time in the graue but in the last day because he is ioyned to christ the roote he shall haue his sommer and be raised by the power of this mysticall vnion thirdly man so vnited shall liue euer therefore the third benefite is eternall life and happinesse by this mysticall vnion we shall haue eternall felicitie and euerlasting life in heauen there we must possesse it but it cometh from this mysticall vnion with christ our head in this life it is begun and is neuer broken in regard of the roote and ground therof but lasteth for euer and by it christ conueyeth eternall life to vs in these words behold i liue for euer amen is the ground of two maine articles of our beleefe namely of the rising of the bodie and of life euerlasting for christ he liueth for euer to giue life to vs for euer and this is the ground of our ioy as to iob i know my redeemer liueth ampc now doth christ liue to giue vs life in heauen then we must haue our conuersation in heauen for where christ is there should be our conuersation because he is the foundation and ground of eternall life to vs now that our conuersation may be in heauen we must often and seriously consider of this eternall life purchased to vs by christ and for this cause he saith behold i liue and withall as we must consider of it we must haue our affections set on him our ioy reioycing and affiance because christ liueth that he might keep eternall life for vs we vse to haue most care to preserue that part wherein life is preserued so seeing christ is the foundation of our life and the author of it we should haue most care of him now followeth the third part of the distinction though i was dead yet i haue the keyes of hell and death in these words we must not imagine hell to be a bodily place kept with locke and key as our houses be nay it cannot be proued out of the scriptures that it is a bodily place or the punishment of hell in regard of our soule and conscience is bodily seeing it is the sense amp feeling of god wrath and vengeance in bodie and soule therfore it is rather spirituall but christ here borroweth a comparison from earthly stewards who when they haue any thing committed to them and haue the keyes put into their hands this sheweth they haue power and authority of al so christ hath the keyes of hell and death that is power ouer hell and death and dominion of them both as if he had said though i once was dead in the graue yet now i haue power and dominion ouer hell and death and haue vanquished them both seeing christ alone hath power ouer hell and death no creature else properly hath authoritie to forgiue sinne but onely christ for he which can forgiue sinne must haue power ouer hell and death but he can take away death the punishment of sin and hell the reward of it ergo he alone can forgiue sin then we see the priesthood of the church of rome is full of blasphemie who hold that man called thereunto can properly forgiue sinne not only pronounce sinne to be forgiuen as the reformed churches hold and which they denie but properly to forgiue sinne seeing christ hath power ouer hell and death we must reuerence him do him all honour and obedience we can if we haue not done this already yet now to begin if we haue then to do it more seeing he hath the key of death he can shut amp open saue and destroy but if we dishonour and disobey him then he will not shut but open the doore to death and hell to plague vs we thinke all is well christ he is a sauiour and all shall be well he is mercifull and so make him our packehorse of our sinnes but we must know he is not onely a sauiour but a iudge he can destroy and saue open and shut he hath the key of heauen and hel and of death this is a comfort to the godly which cleaue to christ that he can keep them fro hell amp death so as they cannot hurt them and this consideration might comfort vs in time of persecution in the time of sicknesse or any calamitie write these things in these words he describeth christ by a second action for after he had comforted s john now he giueth him a commandement which commandement was giuen in the eleuenth verse before and here repeated to john againe first because christ intended by this to shew john his especiall care of his church that he is now still a prouident and carefull head of his church and therefore sayth not once write these things but the second time that the church of god might vnderstand in al ages to come that it is necessary me should know the estate of the church for else he would not haue repeated it againe if it had not bene very necessary it is necessary for man to know that the estate of the church is to be in troubles that they might the better prepare theselues to beare the thirdly he doth it that s john might be more assured certainly of his calling to write and pen this booke fourthly that the church in all ages might be fully assured amp without doubt that this booke is a booke of god and part of holy scripture not inuented by man but reuealed by god to john for the good of the church obiect but though christ reuealed his wil aright john might mistake it and erre in penning answer s john penned this booke both for matter and maner as christ gaue it to him for this we must know that there is a difference betweene apostles and prophets in the old and new testament and ministers of the gospell for they were called immediatly by god and christ and had speciall assistance of the spirit of god which appeareth by those promises they haue made to the by god as christ saith he which receiueth you receiueth me ampc luke and it is not you which speake but the spirit of my father therfore feare not and john the holy ghost shall leade you into all truth which though some apply it to all ministers yet if we mark the place it can agree to none but the apostles and they meeting at ierusalem concluded as it seemed good to the holy ghost amp to them so that we see they could not erre though they were but man but it is not so with the ministers of the word they may and do erre often now s john being a faithfull apostle he receiued this of christ without errour and so penned it in this commaundement of christ is a plaine diuision of this whole booke write the things thou hast seene that is this vision i haue offered to thee amp the things thou sawest in the secod place he sets downe the present estate of the church thirdly the things to come that is the future estate of the church to the end of the world so that this booke containeth two things in it first the estate of the church in time present secondly in time to come to the end of the world the words of christ make this diuision plainly if it be lawful to vse diuisions then it is lawful to set downe rules for direction of diuiding aright but the first is lawful ergo the second therefore the article of reasoning and diuiding as also rhetoricke is not unlawful as some would haue it the mystery of the seuen starres here is the third action of christ which is the interpretation of the vision which he had shewed to john and he onely interprets the principall parts of it now christ expounds this visio to john namely because he was to shew himselfe to be an holy man of god namely a prophet now the principall thing in a prophet is to be able to expound visions either his owne or any others as we see in daniel now that he might shew himselfe to be an absolute prophet in this booke christ doth not onely shew him the vision but the intertation of it he expounds it that john might be incouraged in penning and receiuing the things in this booke now christ expounds not the whole vision but the two principall parts what is meant by the seuen starres and seuen candlestickes namely by the seuen starres seuen angels of the seuen churches by the candlestickes we shewed before in this verse note why christ expounds the two principall parts amp leaues the rest vnexpounded the reason is first because christ hath giuen his church power to expound visions and scripture now if he had expounded euery part and circumstance then there had bene no matter left to the church to exercise her power secondly to stir vp to diligence amp study of the scripture both ministers amp all mebers of the church for if all were plaine then man wold be idle neuer take paines to interpret the word therefore christ expounds the chiefe and leaues the circumstances and appurtenances for the church to interpret thirdly that man might dayly grow in knowledge of the scripture for if all were knowne at first they would not study to increase in knowledge fourthly to stir vp inuocatio for grace to vnderstand scripture now these ministers are called angels which be the pastors and ministers of the church mat john baptist is called christs angel or messenger or ambassadour by this we haue direction to expound another place of scripture where it is said woman must be couered because of the angels that is because of the ministers for the couering of the head in the church of corinthian was a signe of subiection and inferioritie contrary to our vse now the woman when they come into the congregation before the ministers they must be couered to shew their subiection and submission to the gospell and doctrine deliuered to them seeing ministers be called angels that is messengers and ambassadors they must behaue themselues as ambassadors they must haue speciall care first of the matter of the embassy secondly of the maner that they deliuer nothing but their lord mind and in that very maner he would if he were present and if they deliuer any thing els or in any other maner they shalbe suspected of vnfaithfulnes now if christ were on earth wold he deliuer his word partly in english partly in latin or vse the authoritie of the fathers amp philosophy or of poets and surely though me cal this the learned way of preaching yet it is not that christ commaunded nay if this were admitted it would bring in barbarisme and expell the gospell out of this land and bring in that misery which was among the schoole man when all things were brought to needlesse disputations the third thing is the phrase christ vseth the seuen starres are the seuen angels ampc not that they signifie the seuen angels or the candlestickes signifie the seuen churches but are so hence we see that the exposition in the sacrament this is my body and blood is warranted and not to be vnderstood literally as the papists hold for as it is absurd to hold that these were seuen angels indeed because they are called so so to hold the bread is really transformed indeed into christs body but being a signe as it is common in scripture is put for the thing signified this bread is that is represents my body ampc in this second and third chapters is set downe the fourth action of christ whereby john describeth him which is that christ in these two chapters giueth him particular commandements to write seuen epistles to the seuen churches of asia the first of these seuen particular commandements is in this first verse vnto the angell of the church ampc and after the commandement followeth the epistle it selfe these things ampc to the eighth verse vnto the angell this word is two waies vsed first it signifieth the minister or pastor of the particular church of ephesus and so it is taken commonly and of the most secondly it may signifie a company of ministers or gouernours of the particular church of ephesus as paule biddeth the take heed to the flocke of which they were ouerseers shewing there were many ministers of the particular church of ephesus aud so this word angell may signifie the whole copanie of ministers of that church as we see in scripture the naming of one man signifieth a whole multitude god biddeth moses send my son ampc by which particular he noteth the whole bodie of the israelites so thogh antichrist be not one particular man but the whole successio of popes yet paul calleth him that antichrist and that child of perdition amp so it skilleth not whether we take it for one man or the whole multitude of gouernors in this particular commandement are two points first the intent of christ was to write to the whole bodie of the church of ephesus yet he directeth his letter not to them all but to the angell and minister that he intended to write to the whole church it appeareth in the former chapter where he is commanded to write to the churches and in the end of this where he saith he which hath eares let him heare what the spirit writeth to the churches now in that he directeth his epistle to the angell and minister he intimateth to him his dutie first that he must especially labour to teach the particular contents of this epistle to the church of ephesus secondly that he should not onely teach but be a patterne and example to them of the things contained in this epistle secondly he writeth to the angell of the church himselfe because he especially doth great good or harme to the church if the minister be good there cometh much good if he be euill there cometh much euill as all examples shew now christ writeth for this cause to him that he might be diligent and so the cause of good not of euill the second point is that christ among all the seuen churches writeth to the church of ephesus first which is not because it had authoritie aboue the rest but because it was in riches and estimation aboue the rest and was the mother citie for they were all candlestickes and all golden candlestickes but because it excelled all other cities in riches and estimation for that he directeth his epistle first to this church by which he sheweth that those churches townes and people which excell either in riches and estimation and other temporall gifts they must also excell in the graces of god and so all man in particular as they excell in riches and estimation they must excel others in godlinesse and religion so then each town must as it excelleth other in that it hath a greater name greater riches or other temporall blessings go before other which want them if they excell other in these and be inferiour in godlinesse and religion it is a shame for them before god and man too the epistle hath three parts as all ordinarie epistles haue first a preface secondly a proposition thirdly a conclusion the preface in the first verse now the preface or entrance is taken out of the former chapter the end and intent of it is to draw the church of ephesus to reuerence the admonition of christ so that christ propoundeth not that first but makes an entrance to prepare them to receiue the same with reuerence and regard his admonition the third reason which he vseth to do this is thus framed if i be he which holdeth the seuen stars in my right hand that is he which by my mightie power guide blesse protect and defend thee and thy ministers and if i walke in the midst of the seuen candlestickes that is am alwaies present in the midst of thy church to guide blesse and protect you then ye should receiue and reuerence mine admonition but the first is true ergo my admonition must be reuerenced and obeyed both of the ministers and of the people in this preface two things are to be learned first seeing christ repeateth that againe which he taught in the former chapter he sheweth this is a most notable point to be learned and practised of all man which is that christ he is present in his church amp being present by his speciall prouidence doth blesse guide and protect it both in ministers and people this must we labour to learne and to be certainely perswaded of euen of the speciall presence and prouidence of christ in his church in the speciall workes of the same and without this we cannot haue sound religion amp this standeth not in a swimming knowledge in the braine but in a sure perswasion of the same in the heart the second thing is that this perswasion of the speciall presence and prouidence of christ in his church is the meanes to draw vs to all duties of our calling seeing christ maketh this his reason to moue them to obey his admonition so if we think and perswade our selues that christ is present in the midst of his church and withall guideth blesseth and protecteth the same we cannot but be moued to walke as enoch and abraham did with god euen as in his presence in this second verse is the second part of the epistle which is the proposition which containeth the very matter and substance of the epistle this proposition hath two parts first a commendation of this church especially of the ministers in the second and third verses secondly a rebuke or reprehension in the fourth verse first the commendation is in generall i know thy workes secondly in particular for particular duties in the words following i know thy workes some expound it of workes of mercie and liberalitie but that cannot stand but when he saith i know thy workes that is the dealings and practises of the people and ministers in their callings and affaires i know them they are open and not hid from me and not onely know them but with approbation allow them as in coparing this with the fourth verse where there is an opposition though i know thy workes that is allow them yet i find fault in some things with thee whereas christ he knoweth that is approueth their works wayes dealing conuersation and liuing this may be a remedie against all secret and hidden sinnes the adulterer theefe and murtherer wait for the night when they thinke none see them then they may as they thinke practise any sinne so the tradesman he thinking no man seeth him changeth and counterfeiteth his wares and blearing mans eye thinketh all is well and the cause why there is such fraud deceipt guile and iniustice among man is because man thinke they can do it so as none shall see them they say god regardeth and seeth not our dealing psalm but if man would consider that though they can bleare the eye of man yet they cannot hide it from god seeing they be alwaies in his sight this would make man make conscience of many secret corruptions and sins in their hearts whereas this knowledge is ioyned with approbation and so christ approueth of their workes some may aske how can god approue of that which doth not satisfie his law as the best workes of the most holy man of god being stained with sin do not answer the gospell reuealeth to vs more then the lawe being the second part of the word now the gospell telleth vs that if a man will and vnfainedly do his indeuour to please god to obey his will if a man do this in truth the lord accepteth the will for the deed so christ here he approueth of their workes proceeding from a pure will and earnest indeuour as perfect taking the will for the deed but seeing christ approueth their workes the papists may argue hence thus if god approue thus of man then they haue no sinne if they haue none then a man may fulfill the law in this life and so be iustified by works ans christ approueth not their or our workes simply but in part as they be his workes proceeding from his spirit in our hearts but as they proceed from our corrupt will and be fruites of our flesh he doth not againe christ approues them with pardon as they be pardoned and if they were not so approued he could not approue them at all christ sayth i know your workes that is as proceeding from my spirit and as pardoned hauing the guilt taken from them now i come to her commendation particularly which is especially of the angel or minister in whom the first thing commended is this namely labour which is an excellent vertue especially in the ministers painfulnesse diligence and labour in guiding and gouerning the church ouer which they are set and this vertue is worthy of commendation as tim he which ruleth well is worthy of double honour and paul matched and preferred himselfe before all other apostles in this that he laboured more then they all seeing our sauiour christ commends this labour of the ministery we see it is a worke of paines and diligence if it be well done and not of ease and idlenesse as man commonly esteeme of it else christ would neuer commend it aboue all other works in the ministery seeing christ commends the ministers in being painful and diligent in teaching and gouerning the people must be diligent in learning and obeying them but man thinke all is wel if they come and heare the word though they take no paines to know and vnderstand it they will not take paines to increase in the knowledge of religion and the want of this paines and diligence in the people is the cause why the word is heard without profit man bestow all paines care and diligence in worldly things and yet take no paines in the principall namely that which belongs to their soules health but if they would be commended of christ then they must vse diligence take paines in hearing learning and obeying the word of god the minister must labour to teach and to gouerne the people ergo they must labor to obey and keepe a good conscience and to practise religion and as paul laboured to keepe a good conscience so must all man learne to know and vnderstand the word and then to obey and practise the same secondly christ he commends their patience in bearing the crosse which vsually followes the gospell and this is worthy commendation seeing it is more then many of the prophets performed ierem was exceeding impatient ionah being schooled in the whale belly yet after that all things falling not out to his mind he was most impatient but this angel laboured and withall ioyed in the crosse and persecution as he did so must ministers labour to publish the gospell and because the crosse accompanies the gospell they must be armed against persecution with patience they must endure all crosses as luke the good ground brings forth frutie with patience the practise of religion and patience must go together now christ ioyneth these two labouring in his calling and patience together amp seuereth them not first because before the fal man could do all his dutie without trouble with ease and ioy but since the fall we being corrupted can do nothing but it is a trouble to vs and god set this marke on our sinnes that all our duties should be troublesome and our callings should haue crosses and calamities ioyned with them secondly because as the ministers labor to increase in the people knowledge and to do their duties so the diuell labours to hinder them and to stay them therefore they must not onely labour but be diligent to striue with patiece so paul thess he wold haue come to the but satan hindred him now as christ ioyneth these two in the ministery so in all callings these must go together both in particular callings of the church and of the common wealth first we must know the duties of our callings secondly we must labour in patience to practise them with diligence and withal we must know that in the doing of our dutie there is also ioyned affliction therefore we must be armed with patience to vndergo all crosses and afflictions in our callings we must though afflictions come obey the commaundement of god inioyning vs trauell and labour in our callings and rely on his promise that he will blesse vs in our callings if we labour diligently and be patient in afflictions we must not thinke we may leaue our particular callings because of troubles and afflictions but we must faithfully continue in them and with patience endure afflictions and then christ shall conmmend vs which is better then all the things in the world his commendation is better then any man can giue if he commend vs then we are happie though all man speake ill of vs but if we neglect and contemne our callings and will not go on because of afflictions but leaue them for want of patience then instead of commending he will discommend and disgrace vs and then what will it help vs though all man speake well of vs and thou canst not beare ampc now followeth the third particular worke or vertue for which christ commends the church of ephesus and how thou canst not beare them which be wicked here he commends her seueritie against wicked man that is such as liued offensiuely in life or doctrine maintained any manifest heresie or errour the church of ephesus could not beare such but esteemed of them as a burthen which she could not beare but sought to be disburthened of hence we see that it is necessary for wicked man to be seuered from the church and she must be purged of them so in all ages it was practised the church sought to be disburdened of wicked man as when cain had slaine his brother genes the lord cast him out fro his face that is that place where adam amp his family assembled to worship god so saith ieremy the wicked must be taken away ier if thou wilt turne and separate the wicked amp the vile then thou shalt be as the lord mouth corinthian where the incestuous person must be giuen vnto satan all these places proue that wicked man which be offensiue in life or doctrine must be separate from the church she must be purged of them it is necessary the church should be purged of these wicked man first because they defile the worship of god and infect it by their wickednesse whereas they which worship him must be holy as he is holy secondly least the church be defiled amp infected by their wicked doctrine and life for they be as sowre leauen which wil soone infect the whole masse of dough by this we see a manifest and common fault in our churches wherein wicked man are not only suffered to liue but to receiue the sacraments and heare the word preached as though they were good yes though many of the want knowledge be cotemners of the word amp sacraments many be tainted with drunkennesse and vices which accompany that but such as want knowledge or be wicked man in life or doctrine ought not to be suffered to preach to the people and receiue the sacraments therfore we must seek al good meanes to disburthen the church of them secondly seeing they sought to be disburthened of them we see christ hath giuen his church iudicial power to disburthen her self of wicked me to excommunicate and cast them out of the church from receiuing the sacraments she could not beare them but sought to be disburthened which she would not vnlesse christ had giuen her power to do it obiect but some hold that wicked man must not be cast out of the church but must be suffered to liue in the church and proue it by marke the tares must be alone till the end answer but here in the parable of the tares christ speaketh not of the church to be purged by magistrates but of the vniuersall purging in the last day and that not by man but by the angels obiect luke christ bids them compell all in the high wayes now if all must be compelled then none must be exempted and cast out of the church answer christ speaketh not of compelling them to the sacraments but onely to the preaching of the word they must come and heare that yet this proues not that man wicked and offensiue may not be suspended barred and excommunicated in regard of the sacraments and seales of saluation which must be giuen to them onely which haue faith and repentance quest seeing wicked man must be seuered from the church hence a question ariseth how farre forth a man may conuerse with them and keepe company with them which are offensiue in life and doctrine answer euill man must be considered first as they be members of a commonwealth towne or citie secondly as they be members of a particular church by tolleration now as they be members of a commonwealth citie or towne we may conuerse with them in outward things and ciuill affaires as buying selling ampc we may make outward ciuill peace with them though they be wicked as paul biddeth vs haue peace with all man as farre as it may stand with the honor of god and good of the church and societie wherin we liue in this ciuill societie we may performe outward ciuill dutie of loue and ciuill courtesie tit as a wicked man is a member of a particular church we may liue in it with him for we may not because of him leaue that church but still liue and abide in it so christ though the iewes and their doctors were wicked man in life and doctrine hypocrites yet he liued still among them but so as we seeing their wicked life allow not of it but be grieued with it as the sodomites grieued the righteous heart of lot nay although they be admitted to the supper of the lord by the fault of the minister yet we must and may continue among them in the church so did christ he liued among the iewes communicated among them in eating of the passeouer and receiued the sacraments among them though they were corrupt in life and doctrine and the reason is because if thy conscience be good it cannot be defiled by another mans ill conscience yet though we may do these things with them yet two things are unlawful first we must haue no priuate or familiar company with them corinthian the tenth and eleuenth verses secondly no speciall familiaritie we must not barre them of generall duties but of speciall familiaritie onely for by that meanes a man doth not onely countenance their persons but alloweth of their sinnes this then condemneth them which are of that nature that they can fit and frame themselues to all company to the humour and disposition of any company but if there be any openly wicked in life or doctrine we must not keepe any priuate company with him shew him no speciall familiaritie but withdraw our selues from such as burdens to vs and hast examined them this sharpe dealing of the church of ephesus hath parts the first is examination the second codemnation of the false apostles the first part is the discouerie of these false apostles the second the opposing of her selfe against them being discouered the discouerie of the false apostles teacheth two points first that god hath giuen to his church and to the ministers and members of it speciall grace and wisedome an excellent gift of discerning corinthian cor spirituall man endued with the spirit of god can discerne of the lord bodie and bloud betweene bread and wine in the sacrament and common bread and wine corinthian proue your selues shewing that the church and the members thereof haue power and the gift of wisedome to try whether they haue faith or not ioh trie the spirits and here she hath power to discerne of false apostles and by this gift the church of god differeth from all other societies of man no societie saue the church of god hath this gift to iudge betweene good and bad truth and error true apostles and false apostles secondly we gather hence that the church of god can iudge whether a church be a true church or not some man it pleaseth to call this to question nay to deny that there is any church in england but call it the synagogue of satan and say there is no ministerie in it no word no sacraments now seeing the church of god can iudge of vs in england and the churches in germany in scotland amp other euangelicall and reformed churches iudge the church of england a true church it is so though they deny it for we must rather stand to the iudgement of one or many particular true churches then of any one priuate or of many man yes seeing the church of god can iudge of false apostles it hath also power to iudge of scriptures to iudge which books be canonicall which are not and that which the church of rome saith is false that the church indeed can iudge but as it hath authoritie from their church this church of ephesus had this power long before rome was in such name nay it was in this time of john of farre greater name then rome and more famous and excellent the second point in what things this discouerie of false apostles consisteth in what this iudiciall action standeth which god hath giuen to the church it standeth in two things first examination of false doctrine and false teachers secondly condemnation of the after examination for the first he saith and hast examined for the second and found them lyers to come to this examination the church of ephesus had a gift of examination and did examine false apostles and their doctrine but how may a particular church examine a false apostle and his doctrine to do this the man or church which would do it must first prepare themselues and make them fit to examine and in this preparation must haue an humble heart and lowly spirit for god reuealeth not his will to proud man such as haue high minds in their conceit and in this humbling of himselfe he must cleane renounce his owne wit and reason and in regard of himselfe become a foole in his owne reason if he will be wise in the word of god after this preparation he must make prayers to god in his spirit that the lord would reueale the thing to him and that he would open his eyes by the meanes vsed to iudge of truth amp falshood luke iam in the next place he must labour throughly to know and well to conceiue of their false doctrines he must seek to vnderstand them their grounds the differences betweene them and the truth for it is a fowle fault to propound a mans error and not in that meaning he propounded it or gaue it they must further proue and trie whether the doctrine be of god or man to do this he must come to the word of god which must be iudge in the matter not a dumme letter as the papists hold but the true iudge in all matters and most sufficient isaiah ioh search the scriptures only the lord must be iudge in his owne matters he must giue sentence and no angell saint or man now this he doth in the written word therefore they must search whether such doctrines be contained in the scriptures or can by necessarie consequence be collected out of them they must after all this looke to their liues for it is not possible that a false apostle should lead a good life we must looke on his faith and repentance and the fruites of them for though he may bleare the eyes of the world yet if his life be well sifted it will appeare by his faith and repentance he is but an hypocrite and therefore mat christ biddeth vs trie them by their fruites a bad tree cannot bring good fruite but if a man trie and tast them though they appeare beautifull to the eye yet we shall find them to be but hypocriticall and this is a iudgement of god vpon such that they shal be descryed by this one marke by their liues and conuersations if they teach false doctrine they haue liues answerable they cannot but liue accordingly there was neuer any which was a famous hereticke in the church but his life was stained with monstrous sinnes as the historie of the church declareth the second part of the discouerie is condemnation or sentence against them for after she had examined them amp finding them not that they seemed to be she pronounced them to be false apostles and lyers note she calleth them lyers vseth sharp speeches and yet sinneth not seeing christ commendeth her so ministers to shew their hatred against vice may vse sharpe speeches not to raile or taunt but only to shew our hatred and misliking of sinne so john baptist calleth them a generation of vipers christ called herod a foxe paul the galatians fooles in that she calleth them lyers it sheweth three things first that they spake falsely and deliuered that which was vntrue secondly that they sinned of knowledge thirdly that they did it of malice to hurt and deceiue the church for these three be the properties of a liar againe here we see that which paul act foretold by the spirit of prophecie to be fulfilled that among the ephesians should arise lyars on them which professed the gospell with them againe if man in the daies of the apostles they being yet aliue durst so take on the apostolic authoritie to cal theselues apostles and were none no maruell if the pope of rome durst sixe hundred yeares after them take this vpon him and say he is peters successor to take on him apostolicall power to allow of those bookes for canonical which are not and to make them as pure scripture which are onely apocrypha and thou hast suffered in the former words were the first part namely of her seueritie for which christ commended the church of ephesus now followeth the second part which is after their discovery to oppose her self against false apostles how it will appeare in the particulars first of the words thou hast suffered or as well thou hast borne as a burthen for the word signifieth to be pressed down vnder a great burden these burdens were troubles which these false apostles caused after they were discouered first open iniuries and persecutions secondly the spreading of damnable and hereticall doctrines the ecclesiasticall history report that these false apostles were such as cerinthus ebeon marcion and such like now in these words we note it is the will of god that euen the best church shall be troubled by false apostles teaching hereticall doctrine and persecuting the church of god and so become great burdens to the church and that the lord suffers for weightie causes first these false apostles must be that the beleeuers and true imbracers of the gospel might be stirred vp more to embrace and loue the same as iude exhorts the true beleeuers to fight for their common faith and the more religion is oppressed the more we should labour to maintaine it secondly that professors might be proued and tried whether they be true and sound or not corinthian there must be heresies ampc thirdly that god may exercise his indgements on the wicked and hypocrites for they be giuen vp to beleeue lies amp to receiue their false doctrine thess seeing the lord suffereth his best churches to be troubled with false apostles and that for most weightie causes we must not be offended because we see dissensions and scismes in the church which proceed not by reason of the gospell but from wicked erronious and hereticall man for the lord will haue such to liue in his church to make his owne servant to loue him more to trie who be sound professors and to bring iudgement on the wicked these should not make vs discouraged but more to loue and embrace the gospell now after the dealing of these false apostles is set downe the dealing of the church of ephesus against them in all things opposing her selfe against them thou hast suffered and hast patience that is thou hast borne a burden by manifold troubles and persecutions and hast patience to beare them obiect but how can troubles persecutions and patience stand together for troubles are against mens nature and makes them fret and be impatient against god amp man ans these stand together not by nature but by grace rom tribulation brings patience and they stand thus together to him which truly beleeueth in christ god giueth the spirit of meeknes sheds his loue in his heart amp so in the midst of trouble giues him a speciall tast of his mercie and thus in the time of trouble they which be most troubled are withal most patient so trouble and patience may be together and hast patience here is the first way by which the church of ephesus opposed her self against false apostles and their dealings which were double first iniuries and persecutions secondly false doctrines heretical and damnable teaching now by patience she opposed her selfe to both these so the onely way to oppose our selues against persecutors such as iniury or wrong vs is patience whereby we stop their mouthes and if it be possible ouercome and winne them to christ this should be our meanes to oppose our selues against wicked man as well in life and maners as in iudgement and doctrine not to returne iniury for iniurie and wrong for wrong but to haue patience not that we should beare their sinnes but their wrongs and for my names sake hast laboured here is the second meanes how she opposed her selfe against their spreading of damnable and hereticall doctrine which is the second way how they were a burden to her hast laboured that is taken much paines for my name that is my glory and the gospell of christ for maintaining my glory and true religon thou hast taken as great paines as they did to broach heresies and so thou hast opposed thy selfe against them here then is our second way to oppose our selues against damnable heresies of wicked man we must labour to haue the true word of god to maintaine the glory of god and true religion is this so then euery man shall labour for the name and religion of christ both minister and people for this labour is double partly of the minister partly of the people concerning ministers the ministers first labour must be by studying and reading the word to furnish himselfe with sufficient knowledge in the foundation and substance of the gospel of christ and for this cause s john reuelation must eate the booke that is by study amp meditation haue it in his hart and mind to digest it wel psalm the priests lips must preserue knowledge and the people must seeke it at his mouth secondly he must deliuer the whole counsell of god concerning the matter of saluation to the people and the whole doctrine of the gospell contained in the bookes of the prophets and apostles so did paul act he kept nothing backe but deliuered the whole counsell of god thirdly he must be able to discouer and labour to discerne false teachers to the people not onely to know them but make the church to know them tit he must conuince false teachers and then discerne and discouer them which he shall do by two things first by conuincing and discrying their erronious doctrine secondly by reprouing their wicked life so christ noteth the erronious doctrine of the scribes and pharises in their misinterpreting the law secondly their hypocriticall life so paul in all his epistles noteth wicked mens errours and then their bad life fourthly he must labour that the doctrine deliuered out of the gospell may edifie and take fruite in mens hearts which is the end of all preaching and teaching corinthian fifthly he must labour to be a patterne and president in his owne person of that doctrine which he teacheth that so they may haue his example to follow which is an excellent meanes to make them obey the word and the neglect of it is the cause why many contemne the word sixthly he must make petition to god that his particular church may hold receiue amp obey that doctrine he deliuereth so paul in all his epistles praies for them that they may receiue his doctrine now as the minister so the people also must labour for the name of christ euery true member of the church must labour to know amp vnderstand that doctrine which is deliuered out of the word christ bids vs beleeue the gospel and repent therfore we must first know it and then we must beleeue it then we must do as mary did we must leaue other lesse matters and sit at christs feete to heare his gracious words luke further we must labor to haue the same knowledge conueyed to others for if we beleeue truly we cannot containe our selues but we must needs teach others he which drinketh of the well of life out of his belly shall flow full streames of running water ioh he cannot hold it in but will conuey it to others that this may be done first the head of the family he must teach and instruct his family for god hath bound him in conscience to spread abroad that knowledge he hath to conuey it to his family and though he be not able yet god requireth he should be able to instruct them that so a particular and litle church may be in his family againe euery man must labour to win his enemy and those which are ignorant to beleeue the word the scribes and pharises compasse sea and land to make one proselite and the wicked labour to winne man to do as they do much more should we yes and euery man must labour to edifie those which be fellow members with him of the same church in faith hope loue repentance and such like amp as iude saith they must labor to saue some lastly to maintaine the religion of christ against all his enemy to answer them and to stop their mouthes pet seeing the maintaining of the name and religion of christ is so excellent a thing we must aboue all things labour for it to spread it abroad ouer the whole earth to defend it against all false teachers so did the church of ephesus being persecuted and iniured by false apostles and this is a most blessed labor to to defend christ and his religion and with it the honour of god in the end of the verse he setteth downe the maner how she defended it namely that she did not faint but was constant perseuered to the end so we haue had the gospell long time preached we haue defended it with hazard of life amp goods we must not now leaue off but still continue and this exhortation is necessary seeing the lord after so long peace purposeth to try vs by persecution or false teachers then let vs purpose to be constant to the end and not as some who can change as religion changeth be of any religion to maintaine religion is commended but the principall thing for which the church of ephesus is commended is perseuerance neuerthelesse ampc in the fourth verse christ setteth downe a direct and seuere reproofe of this church i haue something against thee here christ dealeth as a iudge calling the church to an accompt laying actions to her charge which actio is this thou hast lost thy first loue that is the church and people of ephesus the angel and the people haue lost that loue to god religion and man which they had when they were first called not that they left it wholly but because both people and minister suffered their first loue to decay that now it was not so feruent and plentifull as before ob christ commendeth her zeale against false apostles answer it is true she had now zeale and loue but in respect of that she had first it was no zeale nay it was cold and frozen therfore he saith thou hast lost thy first loue if god had something against this church then now he may iustly haue against all particular churches in the world especially against vs in this land seeing we be in her estate a great part neuer had loue of christ and many haue fallen from their first loue that some haue fallen it is plaine many in queene maries time were content to liue in persecution for the gospell but after when quietnes came they became plaine worldlings as the historie of the church records and in these dayes of peace and plentie of the gospell such as twentie or seuen and twentie yeares agone were zealous professors now become cold and frozen professors many i graunt are free from this sinne yet are they worse then these for they neuer had the loue of christ and religion but are louers of themselues of this world honour riches and pleasure now then if christ had something against these churches for losing their loue much more may he haue against vs who neuer had true loue of him that man now adayes be louers of themselues of this world and not of christ it appeareth seeing most congregations and churches after this long time of hearing the gospell preached being daily taught yet are not bettered in opinion iudgement life and obedience but still remaine ignorant which argueth no loue of god nor of religion for it is not possible that he which loueth god and loueth religion indeed should continue from yeare to yeare in ignorance neuer profit in practise of religion in bettering his knowledge amp obedience and in that man liue in their particular callings without al loue to god and religion it argueth they loue not god for if they loued god they must needes loue their neighbours these going together but man practise their callings with the loue of themselues of honour riches and pleasure no loue to god no loue to religion this should moue vs to stirre vp our hearts to labor to get true loue of god of religion and of our neighbour that christ haue no action against vs for if a king or a mightie man shold haue an action against vs especially being iust and good it would make one quake and tremble but we haue euen the king of heauen and earth to deale with he hath an action against vs then it is best to looke about vs this paule vrged to timothy that he would go beyond himselfe amp abound in feare loue and repentance philipp he laboured to that which was before forgetting that which was behind that so he might come to perfection he looked first on his wants and then by the tooke occasion to grow and increase in all spirituall graces we are in a way we must walke to heauen there is no standing if we purpose to come to the marke we must be as young children who first are children litle in knowledge and strength after are stronger and lastly become tall man so must we daily grow till we become tall man in christ perfect and tall man in knowledge of religion and they which after long preaching be ignorant or make no increase in religion they be in a dangerous estate and cannot possibly come to the kingdome of heauen hast fallen from thy first loue hence the papists as also other churches gather that a man may fall away wholly and finally then this question must be cosidered whether a man may wholy fall from grace that we may answer to this we must know grace is taken two wayes first for that fauour of god whereby it pleaseth his maiestie to make vs his children which truly beleeue in christ and this is the fountaine of all grace loue and fauor now if grace be taken for this fauor of god in christ the though the outward signs and sensible feeling of god fauor in christ may be lost yet grace that is god fauour in christ cannot be lost a father by some offence of his child may not shew signes of fauour to his son for a time but rather his anger by words or stripes yet for all this he carieth a fatherly mind to him not purposing to disinherit him so when a true child of god sinneth he then feeleth not the fauour of god for he turneth his countenance fro him for a time yet not so that his fauor is wholy lost but he still keepeth it towards vs not purposing to disinherit vs in christ but is still our father and we his children secondly grace signifieth not onely god fauour but the gifts of grace as faith hope repentance ampc which are bestowed on them which beleeue now these graces be of two sorts some necessarie to saluation without which we cannot be saued for without faith no man can be iustified sanctified or glorified now from true faith proceedeth true hope and loue which three graces be especially necessarie to saluation and especiall graces of god spirit secondly there are other graces which be profitable and needfull yet not necessarie to saluatio as feeling of god fauor ioy and alacritie in inuocation of god name feare ioy ampc and these are not so necessarie but that a man which hath them not may be saued now then the three first faith hope loue canot be lost finally or wholly being necessarie to saluation but the other may faith indeed may be weakened and wounded but neuer lost wholly but in part and for a time and so it is said here of the church of ephesus first that grace cannot be lost wholly and finally these reasons proue math christ promised peter and in him the whole church that the gates of hell should neuer preuaile against him for when he saith they shall not preuaile the meaning is they shall shew very much strength but shall not ouercome or preuaile against the church though she may be foyled yet neuer ouercome the second reason is if it were possible he should deceiue the elect of god mat christ taketh it for graunted that they which beleeue which are truly iustified and sanctified cannot fall finally amp so loose their faith thirdly ioh christ saith his sheepe shall neuer perish but they answer that so long as they remaine the sheepe of christ they shall not perish but christ cutteth off that obiection saying no man taketh them out of his hand they shall not be able by their naturall corruption to fall nor any man can take the out of my hands the fourth reason is ioh he that beleeueth hath eternall life they say hopeth but he which hath it in hope truly he cannot loose it seeing hope canot make a man ashamed rom and hope is grounded on faith heb rom whom god predestinateth he calleth iustifieth sanctifieth and glorifieth now if he which beleeueth shall be iustified and glorified then he cannot fall away for he which falleth finally shall neuer be glorified fifthly in the end of the chapter he saith nothing can seuer him and the church of the romanes from the loue of christ ergo not fall finally for then they may be seuered sixthly rom god gifts of saluation are without repentance that is the peculiar gifts of his spirit necessary to saluation are without repentance they say god for his part repents not but man reiects that grace whereof god repented not but this makes god will subiect to the will of his creature and makes man to rule god to obey mans wil seeing they make mans will to rule god will man wils a thing god wils it not yet mans will must stand which is absurd a seuenth reason ioh he which is borne of god sinneth not or cannot sin because the seed of god word is in him now in the first chapter he saith that he which saith he hath no sinne lieth john then meaneth here that he which truly beleeueth sinneth not that is sin ruleth not in him with whole consent but in part and man being partly flesh amp partly spirit as he is regenerate sin proceeds not from him but as he is flesh they answer so long as he abideth borne of god but when he ceaseth to be borne of god he sinneth then with ful consent but he cuts of that cauil and saith neither can sinne seeing the seed of the word working by the spirit of god makeh him continue that he cannot so sinne eighthly if a man may fall wholly and finally then he must be cleane cut off from christ for he must first be cleane cut from christ haue no coniunction with him before he can loose grace wholy now if a man should be so often cut from christ as he looseth grace then he should be often cut off and often reunited to christ and if he should be so often reunited to christ the he should be so often baptised for baptisme is the sacrament of incision and ingraffing into christ but that is absurd that baptisme should be any more then once administred ergo a man is but once ingrafted but once vnited to christ and so cannot be reunited and neuer fall the last reason we pray leade vs not into temptation that is suffer not satan and sinne wholy to preuaile and to conquer vs now in euery petition there are two things first a commaundement to pray secondly a promise that we shall be heard therfore seeing there is a promise in the word that no true child of god shall be wholly conquered of sinne or satan no true child of god can finally fall away against these reasons are brought diverse arguments and they are of three sorts first testimonies of scripture secondly examples thirdly equity for scriptures they alleage these places first exod moses prayeth to god that he may be blotted out of the book of life therfore he which is the true child of god may perish finally answer his petition must be vnderstood with condition if it be possible and so christ let this cup passe if it be possible else moses should pray for that he knew was not possible and so against his owne knowledge for he knew it could not be that one priuate man should die for the people or suffer eternal punishment for them againe moses in that petitio doth principally shew his zeale and earnest loue he bare to god glory and the good of the people in that he neglected his owne life and desired that rather then god should want his glory and they perish he should rather die if it were possible eternally so paul desired to be accursed that the iewes might be saued againe they vrge if the righteous turne from his righteousnes he shall die ergo a righteous man may perish to these words i answer there is a double righteousnes one of the outward action another of the person the first is when a man keepeth the whole law outwardly in respect of man the second in that a mans person is righteous by christs righteousnesse before god a man may haue the first and yet be an hypocrite and so it is meant here of the first not of the second by which ma is in deed righteous before god ans it must be vnderstood of them which esteemed themselues righteous they pleaded that their fathers sinned amp they were punished so that they pretended they were iust but were not so indeed another place is luke there be some which beleeued for a time ans there are three kinds of faith as also of beleeuers historicall temporall and true sauing faith in the first is knowledge amp assent to the word yet no great ioy or reioycing in the second is also ioyned ioy and reioycing to the assent with approbation but in sauing faith there is also apprehension of the promise of god to our selues which is not in the other now as of faith so of beleeuers there be three kinds one which knoweth the word and giueth assent to it yet hath no great loue or liking of it the second he loueth it reioyceth in it but apprehendeth not the promise but the third he beleeueth loueth and apprehendeth the promise now the two first may fall away but the last cannot fall away and luke is to be vnderstood of the two first not of the last but they obiect and say there is but one god and one faith therefore all faith is one philipp answer that is there is but one faith one doctrine of saluation and one religion so faith is vsed in the word and so it must be here vnderstood secondly they proue it by exaples as first of adam secondly of dauid adam he had grace sufficient yet he in his innocencie fell from god therefore much more we which haue not so much grace as he had ans though he had greater measure of grace yet we haue more certaine and sure priuiledges of grace then he had first he had his grace by creation we by redemption which is greater then creation secondly he had the first grace not the second but we haue the first grace and the second too by promise which preserueth vs in the first grace philipp thes the lord is faithfull to establish vs amp to keepe vs from euill god giueth the first grace to beleeue and repent and the second to make vs to continue in the same they obiect dauid fell from grace by two great sins one of adulterie the other of pride answer he fell grieuously and the graces of god were sore decayed weakned and wounded in him not cleane extinguished for then he should haue contened god his word and religion amp despaired of mercie which he did not this sheweth he had the remnants of grace in his heart still though weakened and wounded ob but he prayeth god to create in him a new heart psalm therefore he had cleane lost grace answer dauid speaketh there as he felt himselfe not as he was in respect of god for he felt in his conscience much trouble and god wrath against him ob but he repented not of a whole yeare now no repentance no pardon and no pardon no grace answer the gift of repentance was in him when he fell and after but the practise of it shewed it selfe not till that time that the prophet came to him he wanted not repentance simply but new repentance in practise for that fact their third argument is from equitie of nature amp common reason a child of god may become the member of an harlot now one cannot be the member of god and of the diuell therefore a man may fall finally ans there be three sorts of mebers a dead a decayed and a liuely member the first is as a leg of wood or brasse the second as an arme or leg taken with a palsey the third a mouing and liuely member as an hand sound and ready to moue so in christ there is a dead meber which is only in shew not in deed secondly a member decaied dying but not dead as a man by sin taken with a spiritual palsey which can not feele grace flowing fro christ thirdly a liuely meber which feeleth and liueth in christ now a liuely member of christ can not be the member of an harlot but a decaied member which is in the midst betweene dead and aliue that is the member of christ and the member of an harlot but being not dead but dying shall be quickned againe so a man is made the member of christ spiritually but the member of an harlot by carnall maner they say further if that man be so certaine of their saluation that they cannot fall away then this shewes there is no need of the word no need of preaching and exhortation ans though a man be certaine he cannot fall away yet preaching and exhorting haue their vse not onely to worke grace but also to make man constant in grace and to perseuere to the end and though a man be certaine of his saluation yet he must vse the meanes paul act he knew that not one in the ship should perish yet there must not one go out of the ship esay tels hezechiah he should recouer but he must vse the meanes and so he did but say they this doctrine maintaineth grosse securitie to teach that man are sure they cannot fall ans there is a double securitie one of the flesh when a man giues himselfe to the pleasures and profit of this world hauing no care or conscience of his owne saluation secondly there is a securitie of faith when one relieth wholy on christ in the matter of saluation now seeing that doctrine maintaines securitie not of the flesh but a spirituall securitie of faith and peace of conscience it is not to be disliked for it is a mans chiefe felicitie when a man in life and death relieth wholy on christ thus the answer to the question is that a true beleeuer cannot loose faith nor fall away from grace wholly or finally but in part and for a time seeing this decaying of loue was in this famous church founded and preserued by the apostles then much more is it rife in our church seeing we haue not the like measure of grace that they had then we must looke to our selues see how we decay in loue to god and to our neighbour if we do then we shall find that after long profession we haue decaied much in loue and if we can excuse our selues yet take heed of it for seeing this famous church was subiect to it it cannot be but we are as we see water which is once hot if it be cooled it will be more cold and freeze harder then that which was euer warme so he which hath bin indued and inflamed with the loue of god and his neighbor and after waxeth cold he wil be worse then he which neuer had that heate the hawke while she is fit to catch the prey and liuely to flie well she is set on the hand of the king and nobleman but if she be old or dead then she is cast off or to the dung hill so when we loue god and our neighbour with alacritie and chearefulnesse then we are on god right hand in his fauour and loue but if we die and decay in loue then we are in the ready way to be cast off and cast away our loue to god is like a litle fire or flame then we must not quench it and cast water on it for that puts it out so our sinnes they be as water nay euery sin we commit it as a dish of water cast on the litle fire of our loue and by it we do what we ca to put out the fire of god grace but we must do as the priests did who kept the fire on the altar neuer let it out but fed it continually so we must cherish and preserue this fire and carie wood to this fire dayly secondly we must stirre vp the grace of god dayly in vs as we would lift vp fire and blow it thirdly that it may increase we must exercise the workes of faith loue obedience repentane and godlinesse for without these our loue to god and man will soone decay and waxe cold remember therefore whence thou article fallen in these words christ as a faithfull pastor of our soules prescribeth a most soueraigne remedie against the former vice namely decay in loue now out of this that christ rebuketh not the church of ephesus but withall giueth a soueraigne salue for that sore we learne that the doctrine of the law whereby sinne is reproued is to be taught but withall the gospell must be preached seeing in it alone the remedie is to be had then must we imitate christ that is preach the law in precepts and threatnings and then the gospell seeing the law sheweth only the wound the gospell the remedie the general vse of this remedie standeth in answering to two questions the first question is a man is called effectually to beleeue and to professe the gospell but after his conuersion by the diuell the world or his owne corruption he sinneth and woundeth his conscience how shall he recouer his owne estate ans he must remember from whence he is fallen and do his first works the second question is a man hath liued in ignorance after his owne lust neuer called effectually but now he is touched in conscience for his wicked life how shall such an one be reconciled to god and escape his iudgements ans he must saith christ remember from whence he is fallen by his first father adam and by his owne sinnes secondly he must repent of his sinnes past and lastly he must do his first workes to which he was bound by the law of nature and by the morall law of god now in particular of the remedie it containeth three parts the first remember whence thou article fallen the second and repent and do thy first workes and in the end is a reason to moue them to do these duties or else i will remoue thy candlesticke the first part remember that is remember examine thy selfe thorowly that thou maist see thy decay in thy loue and after that thinke on it often and ponder it in thy heart so that these words inioyne them two duties the first to examine themselues the second to consider of their estate examine that is enter into a diligent search of thine owne heart search thine owne particular wants especially this one want thy decay in loue secondly she must after examination often thinke of her owne wants and often lay them to her owne heart hence we see it is a dangerous thing for any christian not to know his estate not to be acquainted with his owne wants ier he blameth the people for this sinne none among them said so much as what haue i done none examined or considered his owne estate and wants in the dayes of noah they knew nothing till the floud came on them they neuer looked to their owne estate or regarded and considered god iudgements or their owne sinnes and wants and in our time this sinne is too common not one of a thousand examineth his life considereth his owne wants and sinnes nay now if a man turne his eye to see his owne sinnes why then this is a meanes to worke melancholy in a man and so most man flie this which is so necessarie a discipline we see it is a speciall dutie of them which liue in the church to be acquainted with their owne estate to know and often consider their owne wants and sinnes zach when he beginneth to preach repentance he biddeth them search themselues or fanne and winnow themselues as a man would search for a litle thing in an heape of chaffe then we must search our selues diligently and narrowly yes the least thing in vs as zachary biddeth his auditors and after that we find wants in our hearts we must consider of them seriously for no man can repent truly till he know his owne estate throughly then we must often consider it and be well acquainted with it psalm verse i considered my waies that is i entred into my selfe and finding mine owne wants then i turned me to thee and here we see the very cause why so few repent truly because they remember not whence they be fallen and know not their owne estate the second part is repent first when thou article well acquainted with thine owne estate amp knowest thy wants and sinnes then in the second place repent in handling of this dutie note fiue points the first what repentance is the second how it must be practised the third who commaundeth it the fourth who must practise it the fifth for what end repentance is first properly for the place of it in the mind of man for it is after some folly ouerslip or error to be better aduised which is proper to the mind and therfore repentance is properly of the mind againe it is a change in the mind as of an euill mind to become good a turning from sinne to grace from all sinne to god act now this turning from sinne to god standeth in a purpose and resolution whereby a man by god grace purposeth to turne from all sinne to serue the lord and cleaue to him in obeying his commaundements first then there must be a purpose in the mind from which proceedeth a turning of the whole man in will affections and action which is the principall thing in repentance namely the turning of the whole man from euill actions and affections to renued affections and renued actions by this we see that the common description of repentance is not good in that they say it standeth in contrition which is sorrow and remorce for sinne which is no part of repentance but may be a cause of repentance godly sorrow indeed causeth repentance but is nothing of the nature of it corinthian or else that is if you will not practise that remedie to wit renew your former loue and repentance i will come against thee or as the words be in the originall i will come to thee shortly the lord cometh to a people two waies in mercie or iudgement in mercie he cometh when he testifieth his presence to them by shewing mercie as when christ in spirit came to the old world and preached to them as peter saith an hundred and twentie yeares secondly he cometh in iudgement when he testifieth his presence in iudgement so in the second commaundement i will visite the sinnes of the fathers that is i will come and inquire of the fathers sinnes whether they be in their children and will punish them so here if the church of ephesus repent not he will come to her to testifie his presence in iudgement not mercie out of this first generall threatning we may learne this one thing when any people or church liue in any one sinne or decay in loue to god his word and religion he then prepareth himselfe to come to them in iudgement amos he will punish them because they returned not to the lord but lay in their sinnes therefore he biddeth them prepare themselues to meete him this we must apply to our selues our church and people for the sinnes of the church of ephesus be our sinnes we haue decayed in our first loue since we heard the word first we for the most part want loue to god and to man and besides these sinnes we lye in many fearefull sinnes atheisme now abounds in iudgement and in practise contempt of the worship of god neglect and contempt of true religion crueltie oppression and want of mercie yet for all this what man is it that prepareth to meete the lord so that he may iustly say we do decay in loue that it is most true of vs that the lord hath bene long coming to vs for these sinnes in iudgement in plagues and punishments and so is he coming at this day it hangeth ouer our heads and if we continue still in sinne he will surely come thus then seeing the lord hath bene long coming to vs he would haue vs to repent if we will not no doubt he will come and that shortly and remoue his gospell he will come in iudgements and punishments to destroy vs the second threatning is more particular i will remoue thy candlesticke here he sheweth in what particular iudgement he wil come to the namely to remoue her candlesticke in the former chapter he compareth the church to a candlesticke then when he saith he will remoue the candlesticke he meaneth his word and gospell take the ministerie of the word from her and so make her become of a church no church and hauing remoued the gospell will in stead of it send ignorance and blindnesse if thou repent not that is if thou continue stil in thy sin in this second threatning note three things first concerning the minister secondly the church and people thirdly euery priuat man first concerning the minister if he decay in loue to god his word and religion if he continue and lie in his sinnes or any one sinne that is a meanes to depriue him of his office and calling and of his gifts for this is especially directed to the angell ier end the prophet failing in his dutie partly by feare partly by want of patience then the lord he becomes a prophet to ieremy tels him that vnlesse he returne to the lord and repent the lord would make him no prophet so that in him he speakes to all ministers that if they would haue their callings and gifts to remaine they must not liue in any one sin decay in loue to god or religion for then their callings and gifts shall be taken from them as repentance is necessary for all man so especially for ministers they must especially renew it seeing that is the onely meanes to continue their callings and gifts the second thing is concerning a church or people if any church or people decay in loue to god or his word or lie in any one sin they then procure the lord to remoue his candlesticke to take from them his word the gospel and true religion ose the prophet is a foole the man of spirits is mad a heauy iudgement whereof comes this he saith for the sins of the people the prophet is ignorant and becometh mad if this be so then we haue all cause to feare that our sinnes haue deserued the gospell should be taken from vs for in most man there is great decay in loue seeing religion is hated and contemned of most man therfore we must needs feare and the lord for this must needs remoue his word take his gospell away if we meet him not with repentance for he in iustice giues man to beleeue lies when as they will not receiue his truth and gospell being so long among them our dutie then is to seeke to preuent this iudgement by hearty and true repentance the third point concernes euery priuate man euery priuat christian now a daies decayeth in loue to god and man lieth in some one sinne or other ampc now these are the meanes to depriue him of the light of the gospell and his particular gifts for as a mans loue decayeth his knowledge decayeth and so the gospell and the loue to it wax cold in a clock if the watch stand all the wheeles stand if it go softly or swiftly the rest of the wheeles go accordingly so if our loue be increased our knowledge is so if our loue decay our knowledge our vnderstanding in religion decayeth and this is the cause of so litle knowledge especially in auncient folke because they loose their loue heb first we are deceiued by sin secondly our heart is hardened thirdly we call into question religion we set our selues against religion and so fal from it so that decay in grace is the first cause of apostacy then if we would increase in knowledge and religion we must seeke to be cleansed from sinne not liue and die in any one sinne neither decay in loue knowledge or affection to religion some gather hence that a man may fall finally and wholly for if a whole church may much more one man but the reason is not good for there is great difference between one man and a whole church for a church stands of a mixt company good and bad sheepe and goates corne and chaffe wheat and tares now in the church the wicked may fall and become false professors as inded these were and yet the true beleeuers remaine stil now hence it followeth not that a priuate man truly conuerted may fall now followeth the condition of both the threatnings except you amend that is i come in iudgement to you and take away the gospell vnlesse you repent now we must marke that all threatnings in the old testament are with condition so in ionah yet fortie dayes and niniue shall perish that is vnlesse they repent and so are the threatnings in the new testament with the same condition the wil of god or his good pleasure is one alone amp no more what distinction soeuer man vse now his will is partly secret amp partly reuealed his secret will is of those things which he hath not reuealed in his word or by any work and experience to man reuealed is of those things he hath reuealed in his word or else taught man by experience or euent now the reuealed will is with condition alway but the secret will is not but by it he willeth all things good things absolutely and permitteth euill and to make this will subiect to condition were to bind god to his creature but his reuealed will is with condition as here in this place obiect why doth god giue his reuealed will with condition answer because he reuealeth in mercie so much to man as is necessary to saluation and no more and therefore he reuealeth it in that maner as may be most fit for his saluation now when he propounds his will with condition that is best for it keepes man more in awe and seemes better for their saluation then if it were with without condition now marke christ he repeates this condition in the beginning and end of this verse that he will come to them and he wil punish them vnlesse they repent and amend the reason is to shew that when man lie in sinne or decay to god and religion then it is most necessary to repent and it is so necessarie that there is no other way to stay god from remouing the gospell then repentance is this true then it stands vs in hand euerie man in his owne person and in his familie and in the church publikely to meet him with repentance and so we must thinke of it in that christ doubles the condition but this thou hast that thou hatest the workes of the nicolaitanes in these words is a second reason to proue that in the second verse for which christ commended her that she could not abide them which were euill first because she examined them which receiue false teachers secondly she hated their workes to come to the words nicolaitanes were a sect of heretickes who held opinion first that fornication and adulterie were no sinnes secondly that a man might keep company with idolaters in sacrificing in the temple and according to these two opinions they practised fornication adulterie and idolatry these were so called of one nicolas chosen of the apostles to be a deacon act who for a while professed the gospell but after fell away and became head and chiefe of this sect of heretickes but this note sheweth that these words haue reference to the words of rebuke before as if he should say though this decay of loue be thy fault yet i commend thee for this one vertue ampc here note our dutie we must not which is a common sinne be so readie to blase our brethres faults to speake of them paint them out in their colours as we are but we should as well commend their vertues and not obscure them for christ though he found fault yet finding this vertue commends her so should we thou hatest here note this point that it is not sufficient for a man to haue good gifts and graces for he may haue them and be no member of christ but be in danger to be cut off from christ so was iehu he had great zeale so iudas had many good gifts no doubt being an apostle yet fell from christ so the ephesians had an hatred of the sins of the nicolaitans yet were in danger to be cut off from christ then we must labour for that which is the maine point of all which if we haue we cannot fal which is true heartie and vnfained repentance daily and renewed repentance for daily and new sinnes thou hatest the workes here see our dutie we must labour to know the sinnes and heresies of our times and when we know them we must hate them for which christ commends them and and will commend vs if we do the like the workes of the nicolaitanes not their persons so then we must moderate our hatred it must be for the sinnes of man we must hate their sinnes not their persons whether they be friends or foes obiect but dauid he hated mens persons he prayed for the destruction of his enemy both soule and body answer he did it being an extraordinary prophet and it was no doubt reuealed to him that his enemy were obstinate and would not repent and so prophecieth by speciall and extraordinary instinct for euery imprecation in the scripture is as a prophecie but we which want that extraordinary instinct must keep vs within this compasse that we hate onely their sinnes and not their persons the workes of the nicolaitanes in whom note the ioyning of two sinnes together adultery and idolatry for adultery is the punishment of idolatry and idolatry is the punishment of adultrie the one being carnal fornication the other spiritual and the punishment of adulterie and so in all hereticall churches the lord he sends these together in iudgement to punish spirituall adultery with temporall fornication if a church become idolatrous then he giues them ouer to commit fornication and vncleannesse so among the israelites and in the roman church falling to idolatry they abound also with adulterie and fornication thou hatest their workes here we may learne one lesson for we see many man seeing such diuersitie of opinion in matters of religion they will be of no church they will be of no religion but seeing in the best churches planted and guided by the apostles euen in their dayes there were such heresies as these nicolaitans held no maruell if there be schismes and heresies in our dayes yet these should not make vs leaue the church but seeke to be of the true religion and stand faster to it which i also hate christ hauing now commended her would haue her to go on and to encourage her therin he setteth his example for them to follow thou hatest their workes that is well done do so still for so do i and here we see christ requireth that we should be of the same mind iudgement will and affection that he is of and there is good cause why we should seeing he is the head we the members we are bone of his bone flesh of his flesh now then we must see that there be a conformity betweene the head and the members we must hate that he hateth loue that he loueth amp so shew that we be true christians and members of christ ob christ he hateth wicked man why then suffereth he them to liue amp destroyeth the not or take them out of his church answer he suffereth them for iust cause for he can bring good out of euill light out of darknesse he can turne that which is most wicked in it selfe to his glorie and the benefite of his church and children and the destruction of his enemy then no maruel though he suffer them which he hateth let him which hath an eare heare what the spirit saith ampc in this verse christ inferreth this conclusion vpon the former words it containeth in it two parts the first a comandement the second a promise a comandement let him that hath ears ampc a promise in the end of the verse for to him will i giue of the tree ampc and this conclusion serueth to stirre vp the church of ephesus to consider of the former things christ taught her in the commandement is three things the first who be comaunded he which hath an eare secondly what is commanded namely to heare thirdly the thing which must be heard what the spirit saith the parties commaunded to heare are described they which haue an eare that is which can heare mat christ expoundeth it he which hath an eare to heare that is an hearing eare he must heare and giue attention to the word by this we see there be two kinds of hearers one is a deafe hearer not hauing an hearing eare as those which bring outwa d and bodily eares to the word but not the eares of the hart for their hearts are not affected with the word they cannot obey that they heare secondly there is an hearing hearer who not onely heareth with the outward eare of the bodie but he hath his heart pierced and touched hath new eares made by god spirit this is he which bringeth both the eares his head and heart to the word who is affected with it applyeth it to his owne heart and beleeueth the word heard such an eare had dauid the lord god bored his eare and made him new ears euen ears of heart mine ears hast thou opened and when the lord spake to him hauing new eares he answereth the lord lo i come his heart heard the lord such eares had isaiah send me such had lydia her eares were opened and she became attentiue to paules words the lord gaue her new eares seeing christ maketh this distinction of hearers on earth then grace is not vniuersall sauing grace is not giuen to euery particular man that he if he will may heare and haue saluation for there must be some deafe hearers as well as hearing hearers then all cannot heare nor haue eternall life seeing all cannot come to faith and repentance by hearing nay though god admit all into the church yet he giueth not grace to euery one to heare so that he becometh a profitable hearer to beleeue and repent by hearing mat it is giuen to you to know not to others noting that some onely haue the spirit of god to heare to know his will and become obedient to the same seeing the commandement is giuen to hearing hearers we must labour to become such to become good hearers not to bring onely the eares of the bodie to the word but the eares of the heart not onely eares of our bodie which we haue by creatio but the eares of our soules which we haue by regeneration and neuer thinke our selues well till we that hearing of the heart to beleeue and obey that we heare amp can affect the same and be changed and turned by it iosiah heard the law and that not with bodily eares but with his heart so that he turned to the lord accordingly dauid psalm god biddeth him seeke him he hauing his eares bored anew maketh answer lord i will seeke thy face take heed then of deafe eares when we heare the word daily not profiting by it are not changed in life for this deafe eare is a fearefull iudgement of god that man hearing should not heare nor obey and be bettered by that they heare and yet this is our common hearing for the most part we come bring our bodily eare to the word but our hearts hearken not they obey not that we heare but we remaine as blind and ignorant and as full of sinne as euer and that after long hearing which sheweth we are indeed deafe hearers the second point is the dutie commanded namely to heare hearing in the word of god is not onely listening with the bodily eares but to be attentiue to the word and with attention to adde faith repentance conuersion and obedience to it for we if we be good hearers then we must heare so as we be changed from the corruption of the old man and learne to beleeue in christ ephesians and as much as we practise and obey so much we learne for we heare no further then we obey then seeing we must so heare the word we must suffer our selues to be chaunged and altered labour to obey the word and to be changed by it and except we thus heare the word is not to vs the sauor of life but of death and as the good hearing is the readie means to saluation so the deafe hearing is to destructio the third point which is commaunded by god namely that which the spirit speaketh the thing which we must heare with attention faith amp obedience is repentance for our wants and sinnes for of that christ spake afore then this is a most necessarie thing for man to consider their owne wants and sinnes and the iudgement of god for them for else christ would not haue added these words for the conclusion of the epistle who hauing shewed the their wants and the remedie and the iudgment of god for sinnes he addeth this caueat which sheweth the necessitie of these things then it standeth vs vpon to consider our own personal wants our sinnes and the wrath of god against them for the omitting of this dutie is the bringing of god iudgement vpon vs and the practise of it is the preuenting and turning away of god iudgements and as priuate man of their personall sinnes so must country amp cities in generall remeber their wants amp sins and do their first workes in the end of the verse are two reasons to moue them to heare the first because the things spoken are spoken by the spirit that is the holy ghost the third person in trinitie the second because he speaketh not to one or two but to all the churches in one ob but how can the spirit speake these words seeing christ speaketh them ans both may stand for all outward actions of the persons in trinitie are common to them all and seeing this to teach the church is an outward action it belongeth to all three and that the father doth the son doth and what the son doth the holy ghost and the father do in outward actions secondly christ after his ascension teacheth not bodily but by his spirit for christ being at his fathers right hand sendeth his comforter to leade vs into all truth now seeing the holy ghost speaks in the scripture amp he teacheth vs we see how the church of rome sinneth in that they will haue a iudge which must speake for christ he being in heauen and the scriptures being not able to speake but are as a dumme iudge therefore the church that is man in the church they must be iudge of scriptures but we see that the holy ghost speaketh in the scriptures and christ he is iudge alone of them the church is an instrument onely and cannot giue sentence of them but they be of themselues sufficient to take away any doubt whatsoeuer faith is no part of repentance but a cause of it for they be distinct parts of christianity the first a sermon beleeue and repent where repentance followeth faith as a fruite of it thirdly obedience is no part of repentance but a cause thereof ergo repentance stands not in these three properties neither is all one with regeneratio for this goeth before them for godly sorrow is the cause of repentance but regeneration is before godly sorow ergo before repentance too the second point is how we must practise repentance this stands in two things first true humiliation secondly true reformation of life humiliation stands in confessing our sins miseries and wants and in condemning our selues for them and in harty praier to god for pardo reformation is the changing of our bad actions to good and if need require to make satisfaction to man dauid psalm first humbled himselfe secondly he prayed for pardon and withall promiseth reformation of life manasses fel from god but he prayed to god amp humbled himselfe cron so the prodigal son and dauid in all these psalmes of repentance humbles himself psalm and so must we do if we truly repent then we see the danable doctrine of the papists which make repentance stand in contrition and confession of sins to a priest satisfaction for a man may do all these and yet be a reprobate so did iudas he had contrition confessed his sinne made satisfaction and yet his repentance was not true repentance another abuse is that they make contrition a part of repentance which is indeed no grace but may be a cause of grace besides to confesse all sinnes to a priest is a gibbet to a mans conscience and more then god himselfe requireth last of all to teach that a man must satisfie god iustice is to ouerthrow the satisfaction of christ the third point is who commaunds this it is christ now some out of these words gather that god giueth sufficient grace to euery man to repent if they will for say they if he command repentance and yet some cannot then he but mockes them and it is as if we should bid one bound hand and foot to rise and walke ans the lord giueth not that commaundement to euery particular man but to the church or to some people which shal become a church and then he doth it to gather the elect now in the church there be elect and reprobate now this commandement to repent is giuen to the elect directly but to the reprobate by consequence as they be among the elect in the church and this commaundement is giuen to both for diverse ends first to the elect to shew them what they ought to do not their ability what they can do secondly that it may be an outward means to bring them to repetance for when he giueth them this commandement he is present by his spirit philipp he bids them work out their saluation but addeth god giueth the will amp the deed shewing that god giuing that commandement is present by his spirit to worke in them abilitie to performe it now the wicked being in the church haue the same commaundement not directly neither to those ends but first to keepe them in outward ciuill order secondly to make them without excuse but whereas they reason thus if christ command all to repent then all haue sufficiet grace to repet but the first is true ergo ans the first part is false vnles it be restrained thus if he command to this very end that they should repent and practise it for he giueth comandement to some not that they may do it but as to pharaoh to harden their harts for the second part that he giueth commandement to all the meaning is he giueth it onely to the elect directly because he giueth them his spirit to obey it but to the wicked by consequence as they be mingled in the church with his owne children the fourth point is who must repent namely the angel and whole church of ephesus ob but they had repented before how then doth he bid the repent againe ans there are two degrees of repentace one is the beginning the other is the renewing of it in the practise of which two stands the whole life of a christian first to begin to repent when he is truly called and secondly in continuing and renuing it dayly as he often falleth if we haue begun by god grace we must not stay there but go on and be renued euery day there is no man but he shall see in him selfe daily new sins slips and wants for which he must haue renewed repentance then seeing we daily increase our sins we must take heed we lie not or continue in sin without this repentance for we are not so much condened for sin as for lying in sin this if a man repent brings not condemation but lying in sin doth then aboue all things take heed of this amp let vs daily labor to know our sins to be acquainted with our wants to humble our selues amp pray for pardon corinthian i beg you saith paul be reconciled to god they were reconciled before for they were iustified and sanctified but he would haue them to labour to be more assured of their iustification and to haue a more full and sensible feeling of it and that because their apprehension by reason of their weaknes is but sin all the like must be had of vs the fift point is why or for what cause namely for their decay in loue especially and other wants christ prescribeth to the repentance not that they had none at all and so christ preacheth to vs by his ministers to repent of this decay in loue if we haue had loue and feele it now decayed we must repent if we haue not then we must labour to haue it and christ we see giueth a large commaundement not for drunkennesse whooredome theft or such grosse sins but euen for their decay in loue want of knowledge faith feare ampc the common people be of the pharisies and iusticiaries mind that they need no repentance seeing they liue ciuilly not tainted with horrible and grosse sins but we must repent for other sins as want of knowledge loue obedience ampc otherwise we cannot truly repent now if we must repent of al sins much more of notorious sins as of atheisme which now abounds and spreads abroade of pride in apparell contempt of the gospell which increaseth in all places for want of mercie for crueltie and for those sinnes which can sooner remoue the candlesticke from vs now the remedie is to do their first workes to returne to their first loue to god his word and to man this is in the last place seeing this repentance neuer perisheth or decayeth but must be euer renewed so then he would haue vs also to remember what good thoughts affections amp actions we haue had to get them againe and neuer loose them after we must remember to do our first workes which the lord graunted to vs at our first calling them we must labour to do againe or else i will come against thee shortly whenas our sauiour christ had rebuked the church of ephesus for decay in loue and set downe the remedy first to remember whence she was fallen secondly to repent thirdly to do her first works in these words he layeth downe a reason to moue her to vse the remedie especially to repent if she will not then he will come against her shortly this containeth three parts first a generall threatning or cominatio or els i wil come to thee secondly a particular threatning and will remoue thy candlesticke thirdly a condition of the two threatnings except you repent because he speaketh to all churches this shewes our dutie in reading or hearing the word that we apply all that is spoken of one man or to one church to our selues when we see any vertues commended we must imitate them or vices discommended we must search our selues whether we be cleane of them the promise to him which ouercommeth ampc hath two parts first to whom it is made namely to him which ouercommeth secondly what is promised i will giue him of the tree of life namely eternall happinesse the partie to whom is he which preuaileth against all his spirituall enemy the diuell the world hell death and his owne flesh that we may ouercome these three things are necessary first a man must be borne anew become a new creature in christ john for when a man is borne anew he is free from sinne and ouercommeth all his enemy secondly he must haue true faith by vertue whereof he must deny himselfe and wholy rely on christ john we ouercome the world by our faith for he which truly beleeueth in christ he is partaker of christ of his victory ouer death hell sinne and the diuell and hath his naturall corruption abolished and weakned thirdly that we stand against all our enemy with faith and good conscience to the end and he which hath these three he is able to resist al these his enemy to them which ouercome ergo it is false that the promise of the gospell belongs to all man without exception that god offereth life and saluation to all vnlesse they will reiect it for saluation is promised onely vnto them which are borne anew which haue faith in christ denying themselues and they which stand out against all their enemy by faith and good conscience to the end of their dayes is this so is the promise made onely to conquerers we must then labour to be conquerers to ouercome all our spirituall enemy but to liue in sinne to be the servant of satan that is slauerie and hell it selfe and for a man to say in truth of heart that he hath ouercome all these his enemy this is freedome and happinesse and though a man be neuer so great among man yet if he be the vassal of sinne an satan he is out of the fauour of god and most miserable secondly the thing promised is life eternall which is set out by two circumstances first by the cause of it i will giue secondly what to eate of the tree of life in which words is an opposition betweene adam and christ for adam by his sinne depriued himselfe of the tree of life but christ hath set open the tree of life that we may haue free accesse to it adam he lost an earthly paradise christ hath prepared an heauenly paradise the tree of life stood in the midst of the garden whereof adam did eate it was called the tree of life first because it was a sacrament that is a signe and pledge to him of eternall life if he had continued in his estate secondly because this tree had a vertue in it from god to preserue adam for euer from death and old age and to make him continually to liue if he stood this tree of life was a true figure of christ the redeemer and sauiour for as that tree had vertue in it from god to preserue adams life so that he should haue liued for euer and be kept from old age so christ iesus the mediator and redeemer he liueth not onely as he is god but as he is man and not for himselfe alone but to conuey quickening vertue to all which beleeue in him and are partakers of his merits by a true faith to eate of the tree to eate signifieth sometime to beleeue as ioh but it cannot be so here seeing we cannot in heauen beleeue in christ but to eate of that tree is to haue immediate fellowship and communion in heauen with christ for euer for christ shall be to vs a tree of eternall life for euer yes all in all to euery one of vs in this first point of the promise note two things the first wherein consisteth eternall life namely in immediat fellowship amp comunion with christ in heauen for euer and this is our true felicitie to eate of the tree of life to partake with christ in heauen who shall be to his all in all that is all happinesse that heart can wish therefore it standeth not in outward meanes as meate drinke apparell sleepe respiration recreation ampc but in the eating of the tree of life that is in the immediate fellowship with christ iesus for euer secondly the place of this tree is the midst of paradise where christ putteth a difference between the tree of life in the earthly paradise and this in the heauenly paradise he saith in paradise that is in the third or highest heaue a place of ioy and pleasure where the lord especially sheweth his glorie and where he prouideth happinesse for his children there are indeed three heauens one where we liue and breath and where the clouds be the second where the starres be the third is the place where the lord sheweth his presence and where he will haue his children be of this paul speaketh when he was rapt vp to the third heauen corinthian it is called paradise because it is a place of pleasure for so the word signifieth of god that is most excellent and most infinite for so gen rahell wrestled with leah with wrestlings of god that is excellent or great wrestlings so in the psalmes to shew how huge and high the hilles were dauid calleth them the hilles of god the mountaines of god that is excellent or huge mountaines so here he calleth it the paradise of god to shew it is a place most excellent full of pleasure and ioy this place is set out at large reu then seeing this is so excellent a place we should labour aboue all things to come thither to weane our minds from earthly paradise which is but a prison and lift our heads vp to heauen set our hearts and minds on things aboue philipp verse from this eighth verse to the twelfth is the second epistle or letter to another church of asia namely to the church of smyrna and before this second epistle is a second particular commandement to john for the writing of it in these words and to the angell of the church of smyrna write which particular commaundement is prefixed before the epistle to assure them and euery church that s john had sufficient calling to write the same and that he did it not of himselfe and so should all they which come to speake or write the word of god haue a sufficient calling that so the church may receiue their doctrine and without doubt beleeue the same as the true word of god so the ministers of the gospell must haue their calling for if the apostles of christ which were of more excellent gifts had it then such which be but ordinarie man this commandement and the meaning of it is in the first verse of this chapter after the particular commandement is the epistle it selfe standing of three parts first a preface secondly a proposition thirdly a conclusion the preface or entrance is in the eighth verse and containeth a preparation to the matter of the epistle to be deliuered in the preface he sheweth in whose name it is to be deliuered namely in christs he which is and was which is the first and last this he doth for two causes first to stirre the church of smyrna to a religious care and receiuing of the same as the pure word of god secondly because no commaundement concerning religion and god seruice is to be propounded in the name of any creature but onely in the name of god and christ now this epistle being concerning religion and god worship he propoundeth it in christ his name alone and christ in this preface is described by two notable arguments first that he is first and last secondly that he was dead but is aliue but these words are expounded in the first chapter where he saith he is first and last that is he is euerlasting god which hath neither beginning nor end afore all creatures amp after all he was dead but now liueth that is being god tooke vpon him our nature became subiect to death and rose to giue euerlasting life to vs in which words note two points of doctrine first that christ is a person consisting of two natures namely his godhead and manhood for as he is said to be first and last he must be god and as he was dead but now is aliue he is man and as the bodie and soule make one man so the godhead and manhood of christ concurre to make one christ the second point of doctrine is a comfort or the foundation of all ioy and comfort to the church of god first that he is god ergo he is able secondly he is man ergo he is willing to helpe to deliuer his church from all miseries or else ease them for he is first and last ergo true god ergo able to helpe secondly he was dead but liueth therefore willing seeing he came to take our nature vpon him to be subiect to death and to rise againe to giue to vs eternall life so then this is the scope and end of these words to comfort the church in miserie and hence is the very fountaine of all comfort in this life if the lord lay any crosse on thee as persecution tribulation miserie or calamitie then consider these two things christ is god able to helpe he is man willing to deliuer thee and this may be a proppe to stay and hold vs vp that we sinke not in persecutions or crosses i know thy works after the preface followeth the epistle it selfe containing the matter and contents to be deliuered to the church of smyrna in the ninth and tenth verses the epistle hath two parts first a commendation of the church secondly counsell for her concerning time to come the commendation is in the ninth verse i know thy workes in these words as there is a commendation of her there is also a comfort for he doth not onely commend her but comfort her being in miserie i know thy workes we heard these words before expounded i know that is i see thy workes wayes dealing the course and tenour of thy life i know and approue of the same it liketh and pleaseth me well in that christ saith he knoweth her workes here is a notable propertie of christ that he seeth all churches he beholdeth all mens actions he seeth their words workes affections and actions as he spake to the church of ephesus before so now to the church of smyrna to shew them that he is alwaies present in the midst of the church he seeth and beholdeth all her dealings and this consideration is most necessarie and the ground of all grace and religion when a man is perswaded that christ seeth his heart heareth euery word beholdeth all his actions and marketh all his words dauid psalme the lord beholdeth all my secrets there is not a word in my toung but he knoweth it so should we perswade our selues and this would make vs make conscience of all our words our thoughts our actions of all we do or say nay where this is wanting there is no true grace no faith no conscience for if a man were perswaded that christ seeth his workes beholds and markes them he durst not for his life sinne as he doth and thy tribulation here he ioynes workes and tribulation together where we may gather that tribulation must needs go with workes and with the grace of god where grace is there must be tribulations where god giueth grace he addeth tribulation first to humble them secondly to trie them thirdly to preuent other sinnes which they should else commit i know thy tribulation this then is added to comfort the church as if he should say it is true thou article in tribulation but it comes not by chance but from god my father i know it i see and behold it and haue care of it to do thee good psalm this knowledge is ioyned with his prouidence ouer his this i say is spoken to comfort vs if we be in tribulation we must then consider whence it cometh namely from god he knoweth and seeth and careth for it this will ease vs of much griefe and make vs patient so we hauing had long peace must looke for tribulation which when it cometh the onely way to arme vs with patience is to consider that god both seeth it and knoweth it and is amp will be a stay and prop to vphold vs that we faint not in misery after he setteth out two sorts or parts of tribulation first pouertie secondly reproch the first is pouertie namely want of temporall blessings necessary to maintaine this present life now seeing that famous church was so afflicted with pouertie we learne that true religion will not free a man from affliction and from pouertie then let no man think because he beleeueth in christ he shal be rich obiect but god promiseth the fauours and blessings of this and the other life to his servant ans he promiseth indeed but the blessings cocerning the kingdome of heauen without exception amp temporall blessings with condition if they be for our good and his glory else he will send want and pouertie euen to his dearest servant i know thy pouertie this is added to comfort her for that her estate in earthly things was weake yet christ knoweth it he cares and prouides for her and will if it be for her good free her or else giue her patience obiect but how can her workes and pouertie stand together seeing she could not giue to the poore that wanted answer all good works stand not in giuing large almes to the poore but the works of our calling done in faith and good conscience they be good workes though the other haue their place if they be done as they shold for though works in our calling be most meane yet it is a good work to god it is not the matter of the work but the maner of doing it makes a good work namely if it proceed from an honest heart and be done to god glory yet thou article rich here christ intends to comfort her that though she wanted amp was in pouerty yet she was rich in christ she had riches in god luke and this in two respects first when we are recociled to god in christ amp haue assurance of the pardon of our sinnes in him corinthian secondly when we haue grace from god to do good workes tim that we may be rich in good workes we must lay vp a good foundation in heauen for god graces they be true riches the poore man to whom god denieth riches in this world he seeing his estate must labour to haue riches in heauen which are true riches indeed this is to be reconciled to god in christ to haue god graces whereby he can do the workes of his calling in faith and a good conscience againe the man of this world if they would be truly rich they must labour to be reconciled to god in christ but they content themselues with their owne riches and neuer seeke for true riches indeed but are choaked with the desire of temporall riches but all man labour to get earthly riches honour and temporal blessings and esteeme not to be rich in god which is meere madnes the second part of her tribulation is her reproch and thy blasphemie that is the slaunder reuilings and repoches of the church of smyrna this was not onely in respect of god but of their profession and religion for they did reuile and slander them for their profession where we see that they which serue god they must looke for slanders reuiling reprochings he which desires to liue well to worship and serue god he must look for these nay if he haue them not he must suspect himselfe for christ calleth them cursed whom all man speake well of which though it be a great griefe yet christ comforts them he knoweth it seeth it and will in due time remedie it he seeth euery slander defamation and reproach which should make vs patient to endure these blasphemies the persons which blasphemed her they which say they be iewes but be not but are the synagogue of satan that is as in other cities of asia amp europe there were assemblies of iewes that had their abode and synagogues so in smyrna had they assemblies amp a synagogue perswading themselues they had a true church but that the other had not and therfore slandered them for their religion and their christ whom these professed they denied they were iewes by birth coming of the tribe of iudah yet not true iewes in profession and worship of god but a synagogue of satan and so they which reproch religion which reuile the worshippers of god they be iewes by birth but they are not iewes indeed but enemy to god to religion and to the which professe it now concerning these let vs examine first what they were in their own opinio secondly in christs opinio which say they be iewes they coming of the tribe of iudah they thought they were true worshippers of god as abraham isac and iacob were but christ he saith they be the synagogue of satan and as the iewes enemy to god and religion seeme to themselues to be true professors so all the wicked blesse them selues in their sinnes thinke all is well they do as we may see psalm they ouerthrow the truth of god by damnable heresies yet perswade themselues they hold the truth for which they wil die yes witches man and woman wil say they abhorre the diuell they will not haue any thing to do with him but that by good angels and some speciall gift of god they excell other man amp are able to work wonders and so the carnal protestant he sinneth and saith god is mercifull and so makes christ his packe horse but we must learne by their example to suspect our selues to cast downe our pride and conceit of our selues and not thinke too highly of our owne goodnesse but to suspect our selues for many sinnes we may not say we are iewes when we are not the second point is christs iudgement of them he saith they seemed to be iewes but were not but indeed the synagogue of satan that is a company and assembly of man which seemed to serue god but worshipped the diuell obiect but they were god chosen people whom he chose out of all nation to serue him how then could they be the synagogue of satan answer there is a double election first speciall and particular whereby god in his eternall counsell chooseth one to saluation the second is more general whereby he admits man into the outward church to be partakers of the outward signes and priuiledges of the couenant as the sacraments ampc the iewes they had the generall calling but not the particular election rom and so might fall from the church of god to be a synagogue of satan for hauing only the generall election they might renounce the word and sacraments but the particular election is immutable now let vs see when they became thus the synagogue of satan it was not at that time when they put christ to death for though many of the did it of knowledge yet very many of ignorance and after that christ was ascended peter preaching to them tels them that the promise belonged to them and to their children it was not then at this time but when the apostles had laboured by many arguments to proue that christ was the messiah and they would not beleeue still remaining in their wickednesse then they became of the church of god a synagoue of satan for when they wold not heare paul but threatned and reiected him then he left them and preached to the gentiles and then the iewes became of a church no church for the holding of an heresie makes a church to become no church but when a church holds errour in principall points of religion and is openly conuicted by publicke authoritie and iudgement and stil remaines so then it ceaseth to be a church and not before though it be reproued by a priuate man for that is not sufficient so the church of the galatians holding iustification by workes yet ceased not to be a church till it was conuicted publikely by authoritie apostolicall and by this we see what we may iudge of the papists libertines familie of loue ampc which being conuicted by publique iudgement of the church of god are no true churches for they hold such heresies as be condemned in the word and haue bin conuicted long agone of them i come to the cause why they fell namely their vnbeleefe rom ob but they hold the scriptures and defend moses and the law answer though they hold the letter yet they corrupt the sense and where any thing is spoken of christ they seeke to ouerthrow it and so taking away the subiect and matter of the scripture which is christ they ouerthrow all for he which worshippeth god not in but out of christ he worshippeth not god but an idoll so the papists hold the scriptures in word but in deed denie them seeing they take away christ in spoiling him of his merit and intercession for take away his offices and then you shall haue an halfe christ this their example should be euer in our eyes seeing these iewes god own chosen people who he chose out of the whole world to serue him they fell for want of faith and became the synagogue of satan to worship the diuell then we must take heed we be not proud because we haue the word and sacraments and seeme to be the people of god but suspect our selues take heed we maintaine faith in a good conscience and shew it in repentance and obedience lest we be cut off as they were feare none of those things which thou must suffer in this tenth verse is another part of the proposition but seeing christ comforteth the church of smyrna and giueth her counsell and rebuketh her not as the church of ephesus hence some gather that a man may fulfill the whole law and liue without sinne but they be deceiued for christ abstaineth here to rebuke the church not because there was no iust cause of reprehension in her but because he saw that the church did truly beleeue and repent and decayed not in loue as the church of ephesus had done secondly he doth it because god accepteth of the will and indeuour of them which beleeue and repent as of the deed he taketh their labor and indeuour to obey him as perfect obedience at their hands and for these two causes christ he commendeth and comforteth her giueth her counsell and rebuketh her not not that she wanted iust cause of rebuke seeing that this church was so accepted of christ that he would not rebuke her but commendeth and counselleth her we see it is good and necessarie for god church to be in affliction sometime for this church of smyrna was in affliction and so was kept from many sinnes which otherwise she would haue fallen into so for all other churches and children of god it is necessarie to be in affliction sometimes but feare not here is christs counsell which hath three parts first a precept feare not ampc secondly a prophecie behold thirdly a precept againe be thou faithfull the first precept is feare not this commaundement may seeme to be contrarie to other places of scripture as when he biddeth vs worke out our saluation with feare amp trembling amp where paul biddeth vs not be high minded but feare answer there be three kinds of feare the first naturall the second of grace the third of vnbeleefe the first which is in all man by nature is a declining or auoiding of death seeing al things by nature seek to preserue theselues and this naturall feare was in christ who feared death as it was the separation of the soule and bodie though it was no sinne in him but an infirmitie secondly feare is from grace mal saith the lord if i be your father where is my feare which is a reuerence to god in regard of his mercie and iudgment and this is no sinne but a vertue the third is from vnbeleefe when man for feare of persecution or other hurt forsake god and his religion more fearing the persons of man then the maiestie of god now christ speaketh not of the two first but of the last only namely a distrustful feare when for feare of persecution or affliction we forsake god and religion that feare which draweth man from god to death and damnation if they repent not feare not here christ sheweth the sinne of euery man by nature namely to feare man more then god to be more affraid of the face and countenance of man then of the power and might of the euerliuing god which is not onely in sinners but in the regenerate in some part who do not consider of god as he is indeed a mightie iudge taking vengeance on sinners in this christ sheweth the means to arme our selues against all such feare of perils persecution or daunger namely christian fortitude and courage which is a gift of god proceeding from true faith whereby we are made able to lay aside all feare of daunger and to vndergo all persecutions afflictions and dangers for the maintaining of faith and a good conscience this christ often prescribeth and armeth his children with this christian fortitude as the prophets and apostles in the old and new testament and now euery child of god and euery church and it were to be wished that ministers now in our daies could say to all god children feare not but alas now they must change their voice and crie with the prophet howle and lament in sack cloth and ashes for your destruction is at hand and surely there is cause why if one looke and view the bodie of our people as osea saith there is no knowledge of god in the land euery man seeketh to follow his owne waies none cleaueth to the lord seeketh to know and obey him besides they are altogether carnall fleshly dead and drowned with the cares of this life none affecting things belonging to eternall life but all mens hearts are possessed with pleasures profit and preferments of this world nay all man in generall lye in a dead sleep there is no sense or feeling in them a spirituall slumber hath wrapped all mens hearts in securitie and ignorance neuer thinking or considering of the iudgement to come neuer dreaming of the euill day though god preach daily by his iudgement to them againe the contempt of the word and gospell the prophanation of the sabbath want of mercie and loue the cruelty which aboundeth in all man oppression whoredomes fornications these be the sinnes of the people now in our daies rife in euery place these are common sinnes calling for vengeance which will come vndoubtedly vnlesse we repent so that christ cannot speake to vs as to this church but in a contrarie voice but though this be the common estate of most man yet christ he hath a remnant who lament and mourne for the sins of the land who are grieued with the abhominations of the world and these need not feare but they must take to them christian fortitude amp courage lay aside al feare of danger amp of al that man can do and boldly vndergo all crosses and afflictions euen to death to maintaine faith and a good conscience to the end that they may do this let them first consider that they which feare distrustfully must haue a miserable portion in the lake that burneth with fire and brimstone reu therefore for feare of this reward let vs go on fearing nothing they must consider god presence he is by them readie to protect and defend them his angels pitch their tents about them psalm king elishahs servant seeing in dothan an huge armie which beset him and his maister he saith be not affraid for they which be with vs be more then these against vs he was fully perswaded of god presence and protection and that god angels would defend and guard him so should al man in danger they must beleeue and perswade themselues god is present he hath his angels pitching their tents to defend and protect his children god children must consider in perill that it is an honorable thing to suffer for christs sake and it is a happie thing to suffer for the gospell of christ paul he accounted it his chiefe honour nay he reioyced in nothing so much as in his sufferings for christs sake then if suffering the crosse for christs sake be such an honourable thing we must lay aside all feare and by god grace arme our selues with christian fortitude and courage to vndergo all crosses amp afflictions whatsoeuer but those which are not touched with the present day of miserie nor haue not this perfect fortitude they must lament and howle lest the euill day take them vnprouided the next part of christs counsell is a prediction or prophecie of the afflictions which this church must suffer but before he propoundeth the afflictions he setteth a word of attention behold by which he teacheth them and in them vs that it is our dutie often to thinke and consider of the time of affliction before hand to meditate of god iudgements and corrections before they come lest we perish in them for christ luke he came to ierusalem and wept ouer it and foretold the iudgements to come and the cause was because she knew not the day of her visitation because she would not think of her iudgement and affliction to come therefore christ forotels and shewes her final destruction let vs take heed lest it fall out with vs as it did with them it shall come to passe by this christ shewes he is true god for he which can foretell all future things in particular though they be contingent he is god for that is proper to god but christ foretels their particular affliction to come ergo he is god ob but the phisitian can foretell the death of his patient the astronomer the eclipse of the moone to come answer they do so but by meanes the phisitian foretels by the causes and signes he seeth in the partie by which death is in ort present so the astronomer by the naturall course of the heauens can foretel an eclipse by the courses and signes of it in which the eclipse is present but without these signes and causes they cannot simply but christ without any signe or cause simply foretels this affliction in particular to come to the church of smyrna christ describes the affliction first by the cause namely the diuel secondly the persons some of you thirdly the kind imprisonment fourthly the end to trie you fifthly the time ten dayes for the first the cause it is the diuel ob but how can he afflict them seeing he is a spirit and dealeth not with the body of man ans he is indeed a spirit and ruleth in the aire he is the god of this world he ruleth in the hearts of wicked man he ruleth guideth and gouerneth in them directs their thoughts wils affections so as he stirres them vp moues and caries them to persecute the children of god to cast them in prison now in that the diuell is the author of persecution we see of what spirit those be which persecute the church namely man inspired by the diuel moued and ruled by him notorious wicked wretches which haue satan for their king and ruler for this cause paul saith he was the chiefe of sinners seeing he was caried by him to persecute the church of god let then all man take heed of this for he which persecutes the church for religion in word or action he in that action is the vassall of satan led and ruled by the diuell and the diuell in that action vseth him as his instrument satan is the chiefe and principall agent he is his slaue to do his will and is as a souldier vnder his band againe learne we to take pitie on all such persons seeing they be possessed by the diuell led and moued by him yes euen to pray for our persecutors furthermore the weapons we must haue to defend our selues in persecution are not temporall but spirituall seeing our enemy is a spirit we must vse inuocation and praier fasting and humbling our selues by which we shew our faith repentance and obedience to god by this weapon of prayer elijah is called the chariot and horsemen of israel this is a most excellent weapon and if the lord should send a forreine enemy among vs then is indeed the souldier to be vsed but our principall weapon must be prayer that must be our chariot and horsemen the diuell feareth not the sword or gun but this spirituall weapon will ouerthrow him i proceed to the second point their affliction is described by the persons some of you not all but some of them thirdly by the kind of affliction imprisonment he shall not kill or destroy you but imprison you and some of you not all of you fourthly the end to trie you that your hope faith patience and other graces may be made knowne to your selues and other in all these we note that god prouidence is the first and generall cause aboue all causes ouerruling ordering and disposing them in this prouidence he vseth two instruments good as good angels and regenerate man and he workes in and by these in all things and in these there is a good order no disorder the second kind of instruments be bad as wicked angels diuels and wicked man which though they be wicked in themselues yet god can vse them well and in these is nothing but disorder and the lord he worketh by them but not in them and permits their disorder and sinnes to shew by them his iustice and power these wicked instruments in themselues the lord vseth well and to good ends for his prouidence is aboue them it restraines them keepes in their malice bridles them that they cannot shew their malice to the ful but be bridled and kept short being ouermastred by his prouidence so here the diuel he afflicts them yet not all but some of them and he destroyeth not but onely imprisoneth them and not alwayes but for a short time the second action of god prouidence vsing wicked instruments is that the lord turneth all to the good of his children the diuell in afflicting them purposeth their destruction but the lord turneth it to their good to proue them and trie the vertues and graces of their hearts as their faith hope loue patience ampc so that the lord doth not onely restraine their malice but turneth all things to the good of his people now we should often thinke of this prouidence of god and for euer blesse his name for the same seeing he ouerrules the wicked instruments he restraines their malice he vseth them for the good of his children and considering of this it shold make vs to renounce our selues to commit our selues to his protection make his prouidence our sure defence and safegard in all our temptations and seeing the end of their affliction is to trie them we must al first labour to haue the power of godlinesse not onely in outward shew and formall profession but to feele the power of it truly in our hearts for the lord wil trie vs as gold in the fire the lord will cast vs into the fire of affliction to proue vs whether we be pure gold whether we haue pure faith vnfained repentance and a good conscience or not these wil abide the fire and not burne when formal shew of godlinesse will seeing afflictions are to trie vs we must reioyce and thinke tribulation a great blessing i am thinke it exceeding ioy to fall into temptations for by affliction our graces are made manifest to our selues and to the world the fifth circumstance is the time for ten daies some vnderstand by this a long time as gen laban changed iacobs wages ten times that is many times but it is not so here for christ speakes that to comfort them now what comfort were this to be long in affliction others thinke that by ten daies ten yeares is meant and that because it is often in scripture so vsed seeing there is a weeke of yeares as well as of daies but that cannot be proued that they were in persecution so long and no longer then i take it by ten daies is meant a very short time a litle space of time and this is most sutable to all the circumstances of the text and the purpose of christ which was to comfort the church as if he had said thinke not thy affliction to be long for it is but for ten daies a short time in which words note two things first that the afflictions of god church are for a certaine time a time decreed and set downe by god that cannot be shortned or made longer so the lord told abraham that the israelites should be in captiuitie and affliction yeares and so it came to passe for they were in affliction especially in the land of egypt yeares but so soone as that time was expired the same night were they deliuered so daniel for the space of threescore and ten yeares captiuity prayed not to the lord for deliuerance for he knew the time was certaine and could not be changed and therefore was patient but when that time drew to an end then he prayed for deliuerance and the lord heard his prayer this should teach vs in affliction to be patient and to seeke to arme our selues with patience seeing the time of our affliction is certain and cannot be made shorter or longer we cannot be deliuered till the whole time be expired secondly note that the afflictions of god church and children be but for ten dayes a very short space of time in respect of eternall life and this is a notable comfort to any in the crosse and persecution seeing the lord wil put an end to it it shalbe but for ten dayes a short time as paul teacheth corinthian but yet there is more to be noted in these words euery word containing an argument of comfort for the church for first the author of afflictions is the diuell he causeth them now feare not him for he is god enemy therfore thou being his enemy hast god for thy friend and then what can he do to thee to hurt thee for they which haue him their enemy their cause is good secondly he shall not afflict all the whole church but some of you a few of them the lord restraines his malice he cannot do his wil thirdly he cannot kill or destroy them but onely afflict their body fourthly he shall not do that to their destruction as he would but the lord turnes it to try them for their good so this affliction it shall not last alwaies but for ten daies a very short time why then should you feare let not feare ouercome your hearts be not discouraged but take christs fortitude and courage lay aside all feare and vndergo manfully al danger to keepe faith and a good conscience to the end the third part of christs counsell is another precept which containeth a most blessed and heauenly counsell be thou faithfull the children of god ought to be faithfull in regard of god and that fidelitie they owe to him first by promise made to him in baptisme for in that sacrament god promiseth to his child christ with all his benefits and the child of god promiseth and maketh this stipulation to god that he will renounce himselfe and in death and life rely onely on christ now when a man keepeth this promise made in baptisme and performeth this condition to god and stipulation then he is faithfull to god amp when he breaketh it then he is vnfaithfull pet secondly the lord he giueth his servant many graces as faith hope loue repentance ampc these he committeth to man to see how he will vse or abuse them tim we must labour to keepe them to vse them well and this if we do to god glorie and to our owne good then we be faithfull to god else not as if a man commit a thing to be kept by another if he loose it or keepe it not well he is not faithfull to him be faithfull as if he had said thou hast made a promise in baptisme to keepe faith and a good conscience and thou hast had many graces promising to vse them well to keepe them in life and death amp be faithfull in persecutions amp afflictions keepe faith and a good conscience and then thou artfaithfull against this dutie three sorts of man offend first they which though they haue made a couenant in baptisme to serue the lord to keep faith and a good conscience yet liue in ignorance and securitie neuer seeking to know the lord to vnderstand his will or to obey him yet these will brag of their good meanings though they haue no care at all to please god no care to keepe their couenant made with god and their stipulation in baptisme to him secondly they which for a good while haue had faith and a good conscience and haue come to serue the lord yet after long time fall away being entangled with the world with the profit and sinnes thereof and so leaue all and come to breake faith and a good conscience both these are vnfaithfull servant and their reward if the lord dealt in iustice with them is destruction and yet all man in a maner be of these two sorts they either liue in ignorance or fall away after a long time the third sort are they which professe a long time liue in faith and good conscience and be earnest professors yet in time of triall and persecution they will leaue all profession of religion to saue themselues then seeing all these offend we must labour to know god to obey him to keepe his graces bestowed on vs to the end to liue and die in his seruice and to lose our life rather then any one grace which god bestoweth vpon vs and i wil giue thee the crown of life here is a reaso to moue the to go on in persecutio to be faithful to the end hece the papists gather that a man may merit heauen seeing there is promised a crowne of life ans it is called a crowne of life by resemblance for as man in a race first run and after they obtaine the crowne at the end of their race so man must first in this world liue godly run and finish their course after that they haue their crowne in heauen i answer againe this reward is not of the worke but the promise is made to the workers not to the martyredome but to the martyr which hath by suffering death shewed his faith in christ it is not made to the passion or suffering but to the person suffering amp not for his suffering but to him as he is in christ amp declared to be so by his suffering death so then that promise is not made to the work but to the worker and not for his work but for the worthinesse of christ in whom he is a true member of the church the vse then is that if we keepe this promise in baptisme made before god his angels and the church we shall haue the reward of all which is the crowne of life in the kingdome of heauen promised to such as be faithfull to the end let him which hath an eare heare in these words are the coclusion or last part of the epistle now in these three verses for the most part is a rehearsall of those things which christ deliuered before in this and in the former chapter now seeing christ the head and doctor of his church is most perfect in his doctrines both for matter and maner of deliuering the same seeing he repeateth againe and againe the same things and seeing peter put them often in mind of their common saluation hence we note that ministers may often repeate the same doctrine not onely the same matter but in the same maner and words so did christ the head doctor of the church so may we or any preacher preach the same sermon againe in maner and matter not for to ease our selues but for the good and benefite of the church as christ seuen times repeateth the same doctrine to the good of the church and common benefite of all the hearers then if they find the preacher shall deliuer the same doctrine againe or often they must not find fault for then they might as well find fault with christ himselfe who not once or twise but often repeated the same words in this eleuenth verse is a conclusion of the ep stle to the church of smyrna and it hath two parts first a commaundement secondly a promise in the commandement first what is comanded secondly to who the duty commanded is to heare there are two kinds of hearing good and bad here he requireth good hearing with faith and obedience not naked and bare outward hearing then we see the true knowledge of the gospell standeth in hearing with faith and obedience for we know no more then we beleeue and obey if we beleeue and obey nothing we heare and know nothing with sound hearing to saluation the second thing is to whom the commaundement is giuen to them which haue eares to heare for some are deafe some be liuely and hearing hearers they are deafe which heare onely with outward and bodily eares not affected in hart nor chaunged in life by the word they are good hearing hearers which are touched and affected by the word changed and renued in life by the same hauing not onely outward eares of the head but inward bored by god spirit in the heart hence we learne two things first that election is not generall and vniuersall of euery particular man for there is was and shall be euer some deafe hearers secondly we learne our duty that we must not onely heare the word and lend our outward eares but withall ioyne faith obedience and conuersion in life so heare that we be changed in life and turned to god else our hearing is fruitlesse nay to damnation the third thing is what they must heare what the spirit saith namely that which is before in the former words deliuered by christ the principall things be these first that the lord seeth and regardeth the tribulations and afflictions of his church secondly that god church and people being to suffer the crosse and afflictions must forethinke of it and consider of it before it come amp withall must arme themselues with christian courage and fortitude not to feare too much thirdly they must be faithfull to god in regard of their promise and couenant in baptisme in keeping faith and good conscience and in defence of true religion euen to death so that they must heare these three the first concerning god prouidence seeing and regarding his church the second concerning christian fortitude amp courage in afflictions the third our faithfulnes amp constancy in defence of faith amp a good conscience maintaining of true religion to the end these three are the things they should heare and consider and so we must consider and learne the same to excite them and vs to these three things to heare and know the three duties he giueth two reasons first because the spirit speaketh the second is the persons to whom he spake not to one but all churches directly to them of smyrna and in them to all churches to all of vs no man is excepted but must heare him the second part of the conclusion is a promise he which euercometh shal not be hurt that we may ouercom two things are required first to renounce and go out of our selues secondly to cast all our hope trust and affiance in christ which when we do then we haue sauing faith and this ouercometh all our enemy the second thing is to keep faith and a good conscience to defend true religion to the end of our dayes against all enemy and shall not be hurt of the second death that is eternall death for the first death is when the bodie and soule are separated in this life the second when both bodie and soule are separated from god for euer in which separation reu consisteth the destruction of a man euen the suffering of the fire of the eternall lake it is then as if he said though he shall suffer the first death yet he shall not be hurt of the second he shall escape that fire and lake for euer this is a most comfortable and happie promise to escape the lake of hell here note first to whom this promise is made to them which ouercome to them which renounce themselues put their trust and affiance onely in christ and labour to keep faith amp a good conscience to the end then if we would ouercome it is not enough to know to teach or heare of religion but true profession is ioyned with fighting against all the enemy of the same with christian courage let none of them raigne ouer vs but fight till we ouercome and get victorie ouer them all then we ouercome indeed and then to vs is made this promise alas it is nothing to know or approue religion and yet to liue in sinne and to let the diuell the world and ourflesh raigne ouer vs then we must neuer content our selues with bare profession but labour to say in our hearts that we are conquerers of hell death ampc by grace of christ in vs and then we haue a blessed promise of freedome from the second death and of eternall happinesse we shall not feare the fire of hell the burning lake furthermore in these words is answered a question which many a mans heart maketh but few in the truth of heart can answer how may i escape the burning lake how can i flie and auoid the second death ans thou must in this life turne truly to god from all thy euill waies renounce thy selfe beleeue and put thine assurance in christ and withall endeuour to keep faith and a good conscience to the end and then thou shalt escape the second death the fiery lake of hel shal not hurt thee though thou shalt tast of the first yet thou shalt not see the second death would any haue his soule escape this burning lake haue his silly soule free from the torments of hell let him turne to god renounce himselfe put his trust and confidence in christ neuer turne to his former sinnes and withall take heed to maintaine and keepe faith a good conscience and maintaine pure and true religion to the end and then he shall be free from the burning lake further we see by these words that of the two death the second is the worse and most properly death for the first is but a preparation to the second the second is the cruell death and destruction of body and soule this is yet the madnes of man that they feare the pangs of the first and not of the second neuer thinke of the burning lake like children which feare shadowes and neuer feare fire or water but suffer themselues to be drowned or burned and to the angell which is at pergamus in these words is the third particular commaundement of christ to john for the penning and publishing of this third epistle to the church of pergamus by the angell of this church is meant either the minister and pastor or company of the ministers amp gouernors of the same so often in the word one is put for a multitude this particular commaundement is giuen to john by christ to assure him of his calling to pen this booke and epistle secondly to assure the church of the authoritie of the booke seeing it is deliuered by christ himselfe the epistle hath three parts first a preface secondly a proposition thirdly a conclusion the preface in these words thus saith he with hath that sharp ampc the proposition in the thirteenth verse the conclusion in the seuenteenth verse thus saith he here he sheweth in whose name he wrote this epistle to wit christs who is described that he is not onely a prophet and priest but a king in gouerning and guiding his church for he hath a sword in his hand which is described first that it hath to edges secondly it is sharpe meaning by it the word of god so as not onely the doctrine of the law but the promises of the gospell are of the like power hebr christ is thus set out to comfort the church of pergamus for by this christ signifies three things first that he by power of the word killeth sinne wounds it at the heart he killeth and slayeth the corruption of our nature so deadly that it cannot recouer againe secondly that he wil strengthen and maintaine the church and the members of the same by this sword against al their enemy for he will not onely hurt the enemy but defend his by his sword obiect how doth he wound them by the word answer the word must be knowne and beleeued of vs now when we know and beleeue the law and the threates thereof and the points and promises of the gospell then if afflictions come faith by which we beleeue them maketh vs that we are comforted and armeth vs against all afflictions and persecutions so that nothing can hurt vs but if we beleeue it not then the word is to vs as a sword in a sheath not drawn out nor vsed to defend or driue backe our enemy but being beleeued it is powerfull no might of man or any prince is comparable thirdly christ destroyeth and killeth all our enemy all the aduersaries of the church amp this is the principal end of this sword for christ speaketh these words to comfort his church in persecutions and for this he is said to haue a sharpe two edged sword for he killeth and slayeth the enemy of his church partly in this life but deadly in the life to come in this life the word serueth to conuince them of hypocrisie vnbeleefe heresies amp superstition for christ he abolished them with the breath of his mouth that is this sword thess secondly when they be touched by the preaching of this word with desperations for when the law and gospell is preached to them it wounds them to the heart by reuealing all their cursed dealings their vnbeleefe and hypocrisie and sets the conscience on the racke and stirres it vp which is fit of it selfe to accuse them when it hath reuealed their sinnes then it smites them with feare and horror and makes their conscience more fit to accuse amp terrifie them and then though they run on in sin yet they haue a deadly wound of desperation and this increaseth in this life and slayeth in the next for it cleane cuts them off when christ shall say go yee cursed this smiteth them starke dead casting them into eternall destruction for euer we must labour to haue the word of god worke powerfully in vs to take place in our hearts by faith not onely to shew our sins amp god wrath against the same but withal to wound them slay and kill them and at the first to wound deadly for onely to haue our sins detected and our consciences terrified this is the way to desperation and the first wound to death but we must go further haue our corrupt hearts ript vp wounded crucified haue them reformed and this is the way to wound our soules and the end why christ hath the two edged sword the second part is the proposition containing two parts first a commendation secondly a rebuke the commendation in the thirteenth verse i know thy workes in these words he commends this church first in generall secondly in particular generally in these words i know thy workes that is thy waies and doings thy counsels affaires and withall i approue them as psalm the lord knoweth the righteous that is he approues them i know thy works christ he begins with these words in this and euery of these epistles to teach vs one especiall thing that the feare of god is the chiefe thing to be learned the beginning of all religion and for this cause he beginneth thus i know thy workes three or foure times i know shewing by this that wheresoeuer we be we are in the presence of christ he sees all our works he heareth and knoweth all we do we cannot go out of his presence and to settle this deepely in our hearts that he is present alwaies seeing and beholding vs he repeates this seuen times in the beginning of euery epistle then this should teach vs both minister and people to labour to haue this perswasion in our hearts that christ is present seeth and beholdeth all we do when we take any thing in hand he stands at our elbowes looketh on vs whether we do well or ill then we must labour to haue this perswasion in our hearts that we can say now i do this or that my sauiour iesus christ my lord and redeemer he beholds me lookes on me seeth all my dealings therefore i will behaue my selfe well and the preacher may spend himselfe in speaking and to no purpose till god giue grace to teach the people this one point which is the beginning and ground of all religion and feare of god for man may haue knowledge and speake much of the words of religion yet they cannot be true christians till they haue learned this one point to be so perswaded as they can say in their heart christ seeth and beholds me and till we can do that we shall make conscience of no sinne the particular first commendation and where thou dwellest though thou dwel in a place where the diuel hath set his throne a place most incommodious and vnfit yet thou obseruest and keepest my name and religion thus he commendeth her for her constancie in religion throne that is any place where superstition idolatry and wickednesse is practised without controlment and fro whence wickednesse is conueyed to other places for the diuell is the god of this world corinthian and he hath his kingdome throne and seate placed where he can practise sinne and wickednesse where iniquitie is maintained the gospell despised and from whence he conueyeth his diuellish wickednesse to other places such a place was pergamus a citie wherein sinne did abound without controlment religion despised and from whence wickednesse was conueyed to many other cities townes and places here we may note the diuels pollicie who hath his kingdome here on earth like to god here he placeth his thrones as a prince and maketh choice to haue the fittest place where he may rule and raigne and practise wickednesse without controlment amp fro whence he may conuey it to other places he hath euer had hath now amp will haue his thrones he had in old time the high places the groues and such places where the people committed idolatry among the gentiles there were oracles to erect his thrones for in them he gaue answers and so conueyed his wickednesse to many in later dayes he had euery church and chappell his throne when images saints roodes and such like were erected to which all man from all parts of the land came to worship in schooles of learning he had his thrones when nothing was taught but superstition and errors and now in our times he hath his thrones and officers to attend on the same as wisemen and these are a speciall meanes to erect his throne for vnto these come man from farre and neare so that he conueyeth his iniquitie to many seeing many seeke to them and so do him homage so dicing and brothell houses seeing in them iniquitie is practised in them is his throne in families where they liue in ignorance in sinne and wickednesse in blaspheming and drunkennesse or any one sinne there is his throne and so many thrones as families where they liue by any vniust dealing then it is necessarie seeing the diuell hath his throne the lord should haue his opposite to this as when man haue thrones of iustice both ciuill and ecclesiasticall ciuill to represse all iniustice and wickednesse to punish vice to reward vertue and ecclesiasticall to punish and reprehend those sinnes which ciuill iustice cannot the diuell cunningly and pollitickly chooseth pergamus not a base towne or village but a huge citie whence many kings proceeded where there was a famous and great king and where was much people so he chose babylon a citie of confusion and abhomination so he hath chosen rome which is become of a famous church the throne of satan so ierusalem the citie of god the temple of god first began to be a denne of theeues and then the citie fell to wickednesse so the diuell getteth god temple and the holy citie to be his throne and in our time he getteth the great cities amp shire townes for his throne for in the is greater ignorance and the gospell more contemned then in small villages in which after litle preaching it is willingly embraced now the cause of this is because the diuell laboureth especially to haue his throne where he may do the most harme and conuey his doctrine to moe places and liue without controlment if this or any other shire towne or any great citie liue in sin in ignorance and contemne the gospell take heed for they shall become in time a denne of theeues and a synagogue of satan he will haue his throne there now then it is our dutie to labor against him to haue his throne plucked downe to haue him defaced and cast out haue our body and soules subiect to christ renounce our selues relye wholly on christ forsake our owne waies neuer lend our eares to satan let him haue no footing in vs neuer suffer him to come to haue his throne begunne but still labour to haue it razed and turned vpside downe and withall suffer christ to rule suffer him alone to possesse our hearts that so the kingdome of satan being ouerthrowne the kingdome of iesus christ may be increased daily in vs wheras the church of god is gathered out of that place where the diuell hath his kingdome erected we note that the church of god is a company of man deriued and taken out of the synagogue of satan the kingdome of the diuell though it be a chosen people yet it is picked out of the kingdome of the diuell where he ruleth column for all man are by nature the vassals of satan and subiects in his kingdome then no man must stand of his gentilitie and of his nobility and bloud but all our true ioy must be in this that we are the members of the true church of god for what will it auaile a man to haue a golden chaine on his necke and haue his will and affections vnder the slauerie of the diuell or to be the son of a prince and yet to be out of the true church and to be in the company of the wicked a slaue and vassall of the diuell but our ioy must be in this that we are members of the church of god and haue right to the kingdome of heauen sundrie man thinke a man may be saued by any religion and most of the common people thinke that good meaning will saue them but a man may professe any religion and haue good meaning and yet not know one step to the kingdome of heauen but remaine the vassall and slaue of satan for a man may haue outward ciuill iustice and ciuill pollicie and meane well yet be the servant of the diuell we see the children of god gaine a priuiledge aboue all other for in affliction and persecution though they be cast into dangers yet they may assure themselues seeing they be members of god church they be freed from the kingdome of the diuell and so from that place of darknesse seeing the preaching of the word gained a church in the middle of the kingdome of the diuell we see the word hath a diuine power for there is no creature which hath greater power in earth then the diuell except good angels yet the preaching of the word draweth one out of the kingdom of the diuel and gathereth a church in the midst of his kingdome seeing in pergamus where the throne of the diuell was god children were we see that god will haue his servant to dwell in the middle of the wicked and mingled with the vassals of the diuell yet so as he doth this for good causes first that their faith obedience and repentance might be exercised secondly that so they might be kept fro many grieuous sins into which else they would fall so when the lord brought the israelites into the land of canaan he would not cast all their enemy out at once but they must be mingled and dwell with the canaanites for if they should destroy them at once the wild beast might haue destroyed the land so the church must be mingled with euill man that the godly may be exercised and that they might be kept from more grieuous sinnes secondly he will haue his children to dwell with wicked amp vngodly man that their godly life might shine as lights among them philip and so to winne them to the gospell for a godly life is most effectuall to win man to christ thirdly that the lord might shew speciall tokens of his loue and fauour to them that when he bringeth his iudgements on the wicked yet he defendeth them ezech he marked them which mourned that they might escape the iudgement which was brought on ierusalem then if any man dwell among such as contemne and hate religion and the doctrine of the gospell let them be cotented seeing it is god will they should dwell with the wicked and the lord will haue his church on earth proued and exercised by them we see it is lawful for man to dwell with and by such wicked man but they must not communicate with them in their sinnes but abstaine from their wickednesse as lot in sodome and noah dwelt with the wicked man of the old world and the church of pergamus in the place where the diuels kingdom was erected for corinthian there is a question whether a servant hauing a maister which is an infidell may forsake him or not the answer is made he must dwell with him but so that therby he deny not the principall grounds of religion but keepe a good conscience towards god in all things and hence we may see how to answer that old obiection of the papists where was our church fourscore yeares agone before luther preached when the doctrine of antichrist was in all europe by the like i aske where was the church of pergamus when the kingdome of the diuell was there the holy ghost telleth vs that in the same time when the diuell had erected his throne mightily in that place yet there was the church of god so when the man of sinne had spread his doctrine of wickednesse in all europe yet there was a church amongst vs in this and other lands as appeares in that euer there was some which both openly and priuately oppugned his doctrine by word and writing in all ages which shews that though sin ruled in this church many hundred yeares yet the lord had professors though not so visible as now it is when man may professe openly in euery place without feare and kept my name though thou dwellest in a place where the diuel hath erected his throne yet thou maintainest my name and holdest it fast so that neither fraud nor force of enemy can take it from thee my name that is my doctrine of the gospell rom thou doest constantly hold and maintaine it and my religion thou beleeuest the doctrine of saluation which my servant haue deliuered to thee so that in these words christ commends the church of pergamus for constancie in maintaining the doctrine of saluation we see it is not enough for vs to hold beleeue and maintaine religion but we must do it constantly so the word signifi s we must hold the same fast against all aduersaries not easily turned with any blast of mens doctrine but so to hold religion that no enemy by force or fraud draw it from vs when math the man found the pearle he sold all to buy the field and if a man amongst vs should find in our field by his cunning and skil a golden mine he would not tel it to any but go and sel all he had amp buy the groud that so he might inrich himself so we if we know the doctrine of saluation we must labor to make it ours to haue it made sure to vs to sell all we haue to loose life it selfe rather then to forgo that precious pearle tim faith is compared to a precious iewell which must be laid vp in the treasury of a good conscience which cannot be broken into but must be strong in which store house and treasury we must haue true religion and faith locked that nothing get it from vs but loose all we haue euen our life before we part with it for if that be sure all is well but if faith and religion be lost all is gone saluation is lost thy soule is perished now for her further commendation christ sets out her constancie by two arguments first that she held religion without deniall secondly that she held it in the time of bloudy persecution the church of pergamus neuer denied religion or reuolted from faith in christ she did not as many man who hold beleeue and maintaine religion yet in time of triall they will reuolt in this we must imitate her else we know not whether the lord will giue vs grace to repent if he should not we perish esaw sold his birth right for a small thing a few red pottage but after he sought it with repentance and teares amp could not get it we must then hold religion and not in time of affliction and persecution reuolt and deny it lest the lord giue vs no grace to repent which we know not whether he will or not and hast not denied my faith that is mine owne doctrine of the gospell and true religion religion is called christs first because christ with the father and holy ghost is author of it all religion which is good being from aboue secondly because he reuealed it from the bosome of his father thirdly because christ is the matter of al religion christ is the whole subiect of religion in the old and new testament the end of the law and the scope of the gospell the second argument whereby christ sets out her constancie is that she held religion in the time of bloudy persecution when she was thus persecuted she was constant when antiphas was put to death who this antiphas was it is not certainly knowne by any history yet it is thought he was pastor and minister of the church of pergamus who opposed himself and oppugned the doctrine and idolatry of the heathen in that citie in these words are two points first he commends this martyr antiphas when he saith that my servant my faithfull servant antiphas he extols him to the church of pergamus by this we see that it is lawful to honour and commend martyrs which dy for christs cause and that in two things first in giuing them their due deserued honour and commendation as christ did to antiphas secondly by careful imitation of their constancie and vertues and conuersation of life for this cause christ commends this good martyr that the people of pergamus might imitate him in his constancie not to honour him as the papists do with diuine honour and inuocation againe he saith that my faithfull martyr not commending him for his death that he died but for the cause for not the death but the cause makes a martyr for a man may die for heresie and erronious opinion and yet he is no martyr but antiphas he was a true martyr ergo christ saith that my servant nay that my faithfull servant antiphas in the end of this verse he setteth downe the authors of this death of antiphas some among you some of pergamus were the cause of his martyrdome they were such in whom the diuell ruled and raigned and this he repeates to shew that they which haue contemned christs religion though they pretend good things yet they be the slaues of the diuell he rules and raignes in them they be his holds and castels obiect but why did the diuell dwell in the citie of pergamus more then in any other answer because many in this citie were gentiles they hated and contened the gospel amp so became the holds of the diuel we must then take heed we neuer contene the fame for in a family where they liue in ignorance in iniustice fraud and wickednes there the diuell ruleth he hath his throne that is a stable for him to dwell in then masters of families and parents which gouern families must see they loue and embrace religion and teach it to their family else their houses be but the stables of satan his place to dwell in ob but whether might not antiphas being minister and pastor of that church haue fled answer persecution is double either directed against the person of the minister principally or to the whole church equally if it be against his person he may flie safely if he get oportunitie to preserue his life and haue libertie of the church to flie but if it respect the whole church then vnlesse he haue libertie graunted by them he must stay and take part with them in their persecution now of this sort was antiphas persecution seeing he was so called of god to suffer but i haue a few things against thee he commended her before but here he rebukes her and this reproofe is first generally propounded then in more particular in generall he tels them that they wanted zeale thou bearest with them which ampc but i haue these words he spake to the church of ephesus before and here repeates them againe teaching the true members of the church to enter into their owne hearts to search what is in them that christ may haue against them to cal themselues to a strait reckoning to consider all the things they haue done from their beginning to their end and al their life narrowly to examine themselues to lay their sinnes before their eyes without flattering or fauouring themselues not after their owne mind to iudge of them but to examine them by the rule of god word and in all their life looke what things there be for which christ wil come against them for want of this many man being in the church perish neuer consider their former life how they haue liued and for what sins christ wil come against them if we would escape death by christs heauy and strait sentence and come to life we must thus call our selues to a reckoning and simply lay all our sinnes in word thought and deed before our eyes to thinke what we haue deserued and to condemne our selues then we shall preuent that iudgement of christ he shall not need to enter into sentence with vs if we haue put all our sinnes in a booke and reckoned already for them the practise of this duty is the foundation of all religion and the beginning of all grace in the heart but the want of this is the ruine of mens soules and the ready way to destroy them and if this be wanting the minister may speake and preach to little purpose because thou hast borne with them that is entertained them which are wicked here the fault is in more particular namely want of zeale they suffered man which maintained damnable doctrine and heretical opinions to be among them and dwell among them such as held the doctrine of balaam so we see though they held religion yet they did it coldly not shewing their feruent zeale against such as maintained damnable doctrine by this we see the church may vse zeale in excommunicating and cutting off those which maintaine damnable and hereticall doctrine they may after due admonition excommunicate them and cut them off as pernitious members tim alexander and hymineus were excommunicated amp the church may follow paules example to cut off such as hold heresies in the fundamentall points of religion and seeing christ was offended for this their forbearing of those wicked man we see we must not entertaine such as hold such errors and damnable doctrine but haue indignation against them hate their opinions and detest them the church must be couragious to defend truth in religion to stand against wicked heretikes to excommunicate and thrust them out of the church if they remaine obstinate verse thou hast that is thou entertainest certaine wicked man and evil persons which maintaine and teach balaams doctrine the doctrine of the false prophet and as christ reproued them here so he might as well say to vs in this church that he hath something against vs for want of zeale and seueritie against sinne and sinners for though our church doth not hold and maintaine but repell the false doctrine of the church of rome of the anabaptists and the familie of loue yet christ may truly say he hath something against vs for want of zeale against sinners and wicked man for in our church they abound there is abundance of atheists and wicked man in the midst of vs which are partakers of the word amp sacraments amp al outward priuiledges of the church and these atheists though not in word yet in life deny god and religion they know not god cannot distinguish betweene true religion and the heresies and damnable doctrine of the papists they thinke not reuerently of the word of god nor of his ministers and ambassadours amongst vs there be abundance of epicures who giue themselues to all licentiousnesse to eate drinke and sport themselues these loue not the word but being vnder the law of the land they will heare sometimes once a yeare receiue the sacrament and this is all there are also vnmercifull and cruell man oppressors man which in their priuate callings vse all iniustice deceipt fraud wrong oppression with vsurie and such horrible sinnes these are suffered in the church and these be the wise man of the world we count them as politicke and great man now the suffering of these man amongst vs sheweth that in our church is great want of zeale feruencie and seueritie for which christ will come against vs as to the church of pergamus the reason followeth and the confirmation of his rebuke which is to moue the church of pergamus to detest the doctrine of balaam the false prophet and it is taken from the effects of balaam that he gaue wicked counsell to balaak to cast a blocke in the way of the children of israel to make them eate of things offered to idols and commit fornication it standeth in a comparison or similitude as the false prophet balaam cast a stumbling blocke before the israelites to moue them to eate of things offered to idols and commit fornication so there are some among the church of pergamus which labour to moue man to the same sinnes the first part of the similitude is in the first part of this verse as balaam taught false doctrine and gaue ill counsell to balaak ampc in which we must consider three things first what his false counsell was and what an offence is secondly the casting of offence before the israelites thirdly the meanes how an offence properly is any thing word or deed which is cast in a mans way to make him stumble or fall or go out of his way as a stone or peece of wood or such like thing this is a scandall or stumbling blocke properly here it is taken by comparison for any thing which hindereth a man in the way to saluation which hindereth or stoppeth him maketh him fall or go out of the way offence is double either giuen or taken offence giuen is any word or deed whereby a man is procured to sinne offence taken is when a man taketh occasion to sin or to be offended by that which is done well of another so when christ did well and preached the true doctrine of saluation the pharises were offended at his doctrine he did well they tooke occasion to be offended at his well doing now one giueth an offence when he maketh one offended and causeth him as much as he can to sinne so peter telleth christ that the things he spake of should not come to him christ biddeth him come behind him satan where peter gaue an offence to christ though christ did not sinne for christ tooke not the occasion which peter yet offered as for the giuing of offence it is to cause a man to sin or fall away from god by any thing the meanes are things either simply euill or indifferent by things in themselues euill as those which are directly against the word of god those things euill in themselues be either ill perswasions or ill examples for by these offences are often giuen for euill perswasions and examples draw the better sort often to sin and are very dangerous meanes to make man offend againe offences be giuen by things indifferent not euill in themselues but when man vse them vnseasonably and vnfitly out of time and place and not before fit persons so paul saith that if to eate should offend he would neuer eate corinthian so here balaam giueth offence they of pergamus take it to commit sinne and to be stirred vp to fall from god the meanes by which balaam cast these offences before the israelites namely by prouoking them to eate of the meate offered to idols and commit fornication numb when balaam had vsed many waies to curse them and could not preuaile he vsed new meanes which was to send out most wicked and beautifull woman to inuite them to their idole banquets and to fornication and they condescended to them hence we gather this is the peculiar note of a false prophet to draw man to offence to cast stumbling blockes before them in the way to saluation for balaam a false prophet is noted by this and as paul saith godlinesse and true religion is a great mysterie to saluation so false teaching is a mysterie tending to the destruction of mens soules so that by this note we may iudge of all religions both of the iew and the turke but especially of the papists which most trouble vs in this church for all religions whose doctrine tendeth to stop or hinder man in the way to saluation they be the doctrines of diuels the papists religion which our ancient folke call the old religion is a doctrine tending to destroy man to ouerturne the whole morall law of god especially to maintaine adulterie and idolatry the first commandement is thou shalt haue the true god onely for thy god but the papists make moe then one they make the creatures god they inuocate saints which what is it but to make them god to giue them his honour seeing he alone is present euery where amp seeth the hart and seeing they say they can merit which none can do formans sin but onely god no not christ himself if he were not god nay they make the wooden crosse not christ on the crosse to be god in that they call it their hope and so the virgin mary calling her our ladie putting hope in her and saying she can commaund her son in heauen in the matter of saluation the second commaundement they in practise breake in making images of god the father like an old man the son as he was on earth and the holy ghost in forme of a doue amp with religious worship adore and worship saints they erre against the third commaundement teaching that a man may sweare by saints and the fourth in that they make festiual dayes of man and saints to be equal with the sabbath of the lord and take away mens libertie of labouring six dayes to worship their saints as for the fift commandement in this they make subiects free from their lawful loyalty to their lawful princes in the sixt they make and appoint places to which murderers may flie and be safe and in keeping the word from lay man as they call them and so murder their soules in the seuenth they maintaine stewes and houses of professed adultery and hold that the vncle may marry his neece or his great neece for the eight commandement they ouerthrow it in that they make all things saleable heauen hell purgatory and all which is manifest robbery they wrong the ninth commaundement in that they falsly make mens writings the canon of god word nay they maintaine lying seeing that they hold a man being asked of a thing he knowes as when one hath confessed his sinnes another askes him he may though he know the same say he knoweth not that is they know not them to tell them to you but that is a slender excuse for the tenth commaundement they make concupiscence and lust to be no sin and put out that commaundement so that we see this whole religion which is called of old people the old religon is cleane new from the true religion nay it is a doctrine of diuels seeing it tends to leade man to destruction and ouerturning of the whole law of god to come to our owne church true it is man slaunder our doctrine saying it is scandalous three wayes first that we teach god creates man to cast the greatest number of them into hel amp destroy them first we answer we hold that though the scripture speakes not of any certaine number yet the elect are said to be a small number secondly the end why god created man was not to destroy them but to manifest his own glory in their due iust amp deserued damnation amp destructio not that he created man to this end to cast them to hell secondly they charge the doctrine of our church to be a blasphemous doctrine seeing we hold that god decreed mans fall and so do make him the author of sinne answer we say indeed that god decreed mans fall amp permitted him to sin yet teach we not that he is the author of sin for his wil is double generall and particular in his generall wil he decreed to permit man to sin and fall yet so as in respect of god it was good though in respect of man euill for as he can draw out of darknesse light so out of euill he can worke good to himselfe secondly there is his speciall wil by which he wils and delights onely in that which is good and by this he hated mans fall and euen as the magistrate hates amp would not the death of the malefactor yet he wils it in that he executes the same so the lord he in his general wil willed the permitting of mans fall not as it was evil but as it turned to his glory and honour and the good of the elect lastly they charge our doctrine to be a doctrine of securitie and carnall carelesnesse in that we teach man may be certaine of their saluation and to perseuere to the end but seeing we withal teach a man must vse the meanes daily pray heare the word receiue the sacraments and performe all the duties of faith and religion to the end we teach no doctrine of carnall securitie but a doctrine of paine and trouble which maketh man not carelesse but careful to come to heare to be certaine and to perseuere therefore they charge vs wrongfully in all these seeing it is so great a sinne to giue offence we must take especiall heed we giue no offence in our life conuersation word or deed but so to cary our selues that we liue vnspottedly for if we giue offence we are balaams scholers and tread in his path let vs then in our callings so cary our selues vprightly that we giue no offence for wo to them by whom offences come nay it were better they had a mil stone tied to them and they cast into the sea for that is to plunge our brothers soule as much as in vs lieth to the gulfe of hel but we must rather labour to help him to take from him al blocks of offence which if man would do then our church should flourish but the want of this makes man bold to sin and to run on by sinne into hell and as none must giue offence so we must take heed we take no offence or be allured to sin by mens wicked either counsel or examples nay we must cast off all things which may any way hinder vs in the way to heauen if our right eye or hand offend or any thing which is most deare and neare vs we must cut it off if we do so then god blessing is with vs the israelites in the borders of the moabites so long as they serued the lord all curses could not hurt them but turned to their good but after they tooke offence by the moabitish woman to be inticed by them then they came to eat with them at their idol feasts and commit fornication and then the wrath of the lord was vpon them the like may be said of vs seeing they vsed these meanes when they could not preuaile by cursing to send their fairest woman to inuite them to their banquets to incite them to commit fornication we see that temptations drawn fro the right hand from profit and pleasure are most dangerous and preuaile most with man to bring them to sinne and to fall from god as a man that cannot win a citie by force yet by gold by promises of profit or pleasure getteth the gate open so when the diuell cannot preuaile with bitter amp sharp temptations then he vseth those of the right hand and ouerthroweth many we must then take heed especially of these for this cause iob sacrificed daily for his children when they had bene feasting lest they should then haue sinned verse euen so thou hast those which maintaine the doctrine of the nicolaitanes in these words is the second part of the comparison in which two things first what the nicolaitanes were secondly how christ was affected toward them first what they were in the church of pergamus is manifest in these words euen so which is a word of resemblance and relation that may thus be described they were a sect of man in the church of pergamus which maintained two damnable opinions according to the doctrine of balaam first that it was lawful to eate meate offered to idols euen in the idoll temples secondly that fornication was no sin as we haue shewed before it may seeme strange that in the dayes of the apostles so soone after christ there should be any such which held these damnable opinions yet we see there were such notorious heretickes now that we fauour not their opinions we must know the grounds of their errors for the first error that a man might eate meat offered to idols euen in the very temples of idols for is they might vrge christian libertie thus those things which be indifferent may be lawfully vsed but to eate meate offered to idols is a thing indifferent ergo ans if these meats be cosidered in themselues they be indifferent and may lawfully be vsed nay after they be offered to idols if they be sold in the market and bought they may be eaten priuately so that we wound not any weake christian but as they be prepared to be offered to idols vsed in idol temples for the honour of them we may not vse them as prepared for the idol vsed and offered in the temple and had in honour of them now the nicolaitans vsed them so therefore vnlawfully secondly they might and did alleage being professors of christ outwardly other places of scripture as that paul saith an idoll is nothing ergo it is no sinne to eate that which is offered to them ans an idol is nothing by nature subsisting or being nothing which hath any sparke of the godhead in it but yet in mans braine it is something seeing in mens minds and imaginations they repute it as a god thirdly they might alleage naamans exaple king who went into the temple of rimmon and kneeled downe there ans he kneeled not to the idol but to the king who was there amp leaned on his hand so that he bowed downe not with any diuine worship to the idol but with ciuil worship to the kings maiestie and naaman was in the temple not to worship the idoll but to make protestation that he would serue the god of israel and for that end caried as much earth as two mules could beare to offer sacrifice to the lord and if the nicolaitans had bene so in the idol temples to protest that they would worship the true god then they had not sinned so if any come into a place and be present where masse is said with protestation to serue the lord he then allowes not of the same but rather condemnes them for it for the second opinion of these nicolaitanes that fornication was no sinne they seemed so to proue it out of genes when the man of sodom came to lots house he offereth them his daughters now he would not haue done it say they if it had bin a sin ans lot seemes to be faulty and not to be excused in that though he thought to escape the greater sin by the less but we must not do evil that good may come thereof againe they might vrge that hos the lord commanded hosea to take a wife and children of fornication ans some say it was onely in vision not in deed some answer that he did it in speech onely as he was a prophet because he prophesied to the people that he was as one that had such a wife and children which both are safe answers and allowed other more likely say it was a thing not in vision and word only but in deed and truth done and surely seeing the prophets name the womans name amp her fathers name are set downe it seemeth to be a thing done indeed neither doth a thing in speech so much affect the people as a deed and fact done and the best and most auncient interpreters which were nearest the time of christ interpret it a thing done indeed but you may say this was against good maners amp contrary to god law that the prophet should take such a wife ans no seeing god is aboue his law and can dispense with it as when he bids abraham kil his son and he had not sinned if he had slaine him so here hosea he did not sinne hauing a particular and speciall commaundement for the same neither did he this to commit fornication but to make of an harlot an honest woman and he is bidden to take the children of fornination not that he should beget any in fornication but take her children which she had borne in fornication againe act the apostle speaking of two things indifferent ioyneth fornication to them ans first he doth so because the gentiles thought that it was no sinne but indifferent and they are there conioyned though fornication be not a thing indifferent because the gentiles offended the iewes by these three ioyntly together now followeth the affection of christ which things i also hate that is not their persons but their errors which thing i hate first he teacheth vs to auoide and dislike the least honour or approbation which can be giuen to idols for these nicolaitanes did not honour idols or offer to them but came into their temples and inuited by their friends did eate of the meate offered to them yet christ hateth their dealing shewing he wold haue vs to do the like this also condemneth the practise of the church of rome who say they worship not idols yet they kneele downe to the images of christ and saints adore them light candles and tapers to them offer to them hang costly iewels about their neckes cloth them with costly apparell and so do indeed farre more then the nicolaitanes did therefore hath christ cause to hate them much more this also teacheth man which trauell to take heed that they trauell not without any calling to see newes out of the limits of the church as to spaine and italie for then they being out of the bounds of the true church offer themselues to occasions which may bring them to idolatry though they hate images for being in idolatrous places they must come into their temples and do as their maner is offer to idols and kneele downe to them which they cannot without some approbation whereas they should hate the least approbation or liking of them then it is good for man which trauell to trauell within the church and not out but by some speciall calling and necessitie further by this christ would haue vs to hate all familiar societie with idolaters a man may i graunt liue with idolaters in a ciuill course of peace but not to haue a speciall kind of familiaritie and amitie with them now as christ hated their idolatry so did he their fornicatio giuing vs example to hate fornication first because our body are not our owne but the bodie of a faithfull man or woman is the bodie of christ he hath bought it therefore we must consecrate and dedicate them to honour him not satan his enemy our bodie and soule is the member of christ at least by profession then we must not take the member of christ and make it the member of an harlot our bodie and soule is the house and temple of the holy ghost therefore we must keepe them faire pure and cleane fit to entertaine such a guest but they which pollute themselues with fornication make them sties and stables for the diuell repent quickely hauing laid downe the fault of the church of pergamus and the errors of the nicolaitanes here he sheweth the remedie to escape and after the remedie addeth two reasons to moue the to practise the remedie the first cocerning the whole church of pergamus the second the nicolaitans in the remedie note first what repentance is secondly why it is so often prescribed by christ to his church thirdly to whom to repent properly is to change the mind from euill to good from sinne to god thus when by god grace a man hath this purpose in his heart not to sin as before but in all things wholly to do the will of god for euer but here repentance as commonly in the scripture is taken more largely for all the duties which go with or are in repentance as first humiliation confession of our sinnes condemning our selues for them secondly inuocation for pardon of them thirdly reformation of life when a man purposeth and indeuoreth in his life to do the will of god but why doth christ so often repeate and prescribe repentance to his church ans not because it is a meanes to procure or demerit saluation and reconciliation with god for onely the death and passion of christ and his merits alone can do that but he calleth them often to this dutie because it is the most excellent fruite of faith repentance of it selfe procureth not god fauour but it is a token of god fauour procured in christ secondly because it is a path way wherein all man must walke which must haue pardon of their sinnes and life euerlasting but to whom doth christ prescribe repentance ans first to the whole church of pergamus secondly to the nicolaitanes as for the church of pergamus the ministers and people thereof christ before had commended them for worthie graces amp they had repentance before yet christ bids them repent still now in that he prescribeth repentance still to a repentant people it sheweth vs that the whole life of a christian is a continuall practise of repentance a daily and perpetuall repentance when one hath begunne and repented once that is not enough but as euery day addeth to our age so euery day for our new sinnes we must haue new repentance corinthian paule desired them to labour to be reconciled to god now corinthian they were reconciled alreadie and had true repentance noting that they must labour to haue their reconciliation more increased in regard of the certaintie of it and their daily offences and sinnes now we must thinke that what christ spake to the church of pergamus is spoken to vs and if we be in the like sin we must learne to performe the same dutie which they are commanded here christ moreouer prescribeth this not onely to the church of pergamus but to the nicolaitanes which held two damnable errors and as they held them no doubt they liued accordingly yet christ biddeth them repent then great and grieuous sinners are not barred from god mercie if they will repent excellent is that of esay our god is much exceeding much in mercie psalm god is much in mercie plenteous in redemption no man which is a grieuous sinner but god offereth him mercie if he will repent and lay hold on it among vs in this church are many ignorant and euill people yet if these will repent the lord offereth his mercie though they be as wicked as the nicolaitanes as iudas or herode were yet christ offereth his mercie and merite if they will lay hold on it then let all such wicked man breake off their sins by repentance of their idolatry blasphemie fornication and humble themselues with iob in dust and ashes and they shall find mercie but we must not abuse god mercie to presumption but be sure that though thy sinnes be as scarlet or crimson or as scarlet which can take no other colour yet there is mercie in store to helpe thee if thou repent this doctrine may be taught to malefactors not to imbolden them in sinne but to assure them that if they repent at any time the lord will heare them yes though a man fall often into the same sinne which is dangerous yet if he haue grace to repent god fountaine of mercie is not drawne dry but still he hath in store onely they must repent for if they looke to haue the merit of christ christ looketh to haue their repentance else i will come against thee shortly after the remedy followes a two fold reason to inforce and set an edge on the former doctrine first concerning the church of pergamus secondly concerning the nicolaitanes holding and practising of these two sinnes the first cause and reason if not i will come ampc that is if thou do not repent for these sinnes want of zeale and other thy particular sinnes i will come to thee shortly to punish and plague thee for the lord as i haue said he cometh either in mercy or in iudgement now if they repent not christ saith he will come to them not to help them but to execute iudgement on them to punish them so esay christ saith not i will but i come to thee expressing the time to come by the time present to certifie them that if they repent not he will most surely come as certainly as if he did now come to them in this threatning we see a generall rule to be learned of all that if any church or people will not repent then the lord will come to them in iudgement to punish them as by sundry examples we may see the lord hath done in our church and people though some do repent yet for the common body of the people they do not but they liue in sinne and ignorance hauing no care to know god will and if they know it yet no care to obey the same but they for the most part continue in their sinnes seeing their case is such who could not out of god word in good conscience foretell and prophesie by this generall rule that god will come against them shortly to take vengeance on them and to plague them though we may flat our selues and think all is well yet we must assure our selues he cannot but come vnlesse we repent this should then moue vs all to repent to humble our selues condemne our selues for our sins craue pardon purpose newnesse of life desire the lord that he would in christ be reconciled to each of vs and promise and performe euer after new obedience if we doe repent daily for new and particular sinnes then we shall stay the lord preuent his coming to punish vs but if we go on in sinne assure our selues the lord is true of his promise he will come in iudgement against vs the second reason is directed to the nicolaitans with whom he wil fight that is be at enmitie with them and declare the same in waging battell with them seeing they hold these two grosse and damnable inions with the sword of my mouth that is the preaching and publilishing of the word the ministery and dispensation of the law and the gospell among man in which words he still alludeth to the doing of balaam as in the doctrine so in the end and scope for when balaam cursed the children of israel the angell stood against him to stay and hinder him that he should not go he seeing the angel fel downe and worshipped the angel that is the son of god christ iesus but after seeing he would not be restrained but went to curse the people he perished by the sword numb euen so christ dealeth with the nicolaitanes as he did with balaam seeing they went on still in wickednes he fighteth with them to reclaime them from their wicked wayes he withstands them with the sword of his mouth but if they will needs go on then he fights not to reclaime them but to slay them as he did balaam but i will fight against thee not kill thee for christ he intended not at the first to slay them but to withstand them and if it might be to reclaime them but after if they would not be hindered and stayed to destroy them as he did balaam seeing christ comes against the wicked and impenitent not to kill them but to withstand and hinder them at the first we see his wonderfull patience toward sinners and wicked man so gen the lord striued and wrestled with the old world one hundred and twentie yeares that they might repent by the preaching of noah and genes he bare with the amorites till their sinnes were come to the full and he bare with the aegyptians many hundred yeares nay the iewes after they had killed christ were not straight way consumed but the lord suffered them fiftie yeares so the lord suffereth sinners the blasphemer adulterer and cruell man to liue cometh often to them by his word not to kill them at first but to winne and reclaime them and so euery one of vs feeleth his mercie in that he might destroy and cast vs into hell so soone as we be borne yet he suffereth vs to liue some twentie thirtie or fortie yeares that we might haue a time and space to repent and turne to christ then it is our dutie to take this occasion to take this time of god patience not to let it slip but haste to re ntance ere the time of patience be ended the old world had one hundred and twentie yeares of patience but neglecting it they perished the time of mercie being ended seeing they wold not heare noah therefore they be now in prison that is in hell againe in that christ saith he will come thus against the nicolaitanes we see that they which repent not haue god for their enemie to fight against them and for this cause sinne is called rebellion against god now this is a most fearefull thing to haue god mans enemie let vs then repent that we may haue god a friend to vs as he was to abraham and as christ was to his disciples i will come to thee and fight against thee here christ sheweth he is the true pastor and doctor of the church he can deuide the word aright giue promises to them to whom they belong and threatnings to whom they belong for iudgements and promises must not be propounded to all equally but there must be regard had of time place and persons for iudgements some be temporall which must be threatned to the penitent some eternal and those to the impenitent so promises are to be made not hand ouer head but with respect condition limitation and restraint to propound either promises or threatnings otherwise is not to deuide the word aright with the sword of my mouth that is the ministerie of the word not to kill them but to resist and withstand them which repent not and this is the chiefe end and scope of the preaching of the word to winne man from their sinnes and wicked wayes and if they will not repent then to drowne them in perdition and to slay them in this church of england and in this congregation we haue had the gospell this yeares published and preached to vs the lord hath rebuked vs for our sinnes and yet we still abide in them without repentance the lord still cometh against vs with the sword of his mouth stil checkes vs for our sinnes and controlleth the wicked idolater atheist fornicator amp cruel man he stands to fight against such face to face stands with his naked sword in the ministery of the word to reclaime them from their sins if they wil not to wound them to the heart and to kil them now we hearing our sins reprooued we should feare and tremble fall downe as balaam did and seeing the lord in the word preached stands with his sword in his hand ready to slay vs if we wil not be stayed we should be afraid if we heare of an enemy to come against vs how will euery one quake for feare shall we feare the shaking sword of a mortal man and not the bloudy sword of the euerliuing god shall we resist him and go on though he fight against vs alas it is not wisedome to striue with god for then he will hacke vs to peeces but we must heare him and submit our selues to his good will amp pleasure and if we wil not the same sword of god shall be an instrument to pierce our hearts to death then when we heare the minister speaking to vs we must know that the lord speaketh to vs fights against our sins and not contemne him againe we see the word of god is called the sword of christs mouth not only because he once deliuered it but because it dayly proceeds fro him in the preaching of the same by the ministers then we see this is an excellent thing that the ministers of christ lawfully called they be that mouth of christ from which his sword proceeds so paul calleth them the ambassadours of christ to deliuer his word corinthian then they which be in the schooles of the prophets and they also which be in the way to the same must learne to thinke reuerently and highly of it not contemne it and thinke it a base calling for to be a lawyer or phisition hath not this priuiledge to be called the mouth of christ as the ministers haue againe seeing they be the mouth of christ ministers must speake the word of christ as they are perswaded in conscience christ would speake the same if he were present euen as ambassadors who deliuer their masters will in that maner and those words which they thinke he would himselfe which if we did then we should not haue that humane kind of preaching partly in greeke latin amp english mingled with testimonies and sentences of man for christ would neuer preach so neither did his apostles or prophets vse it furthermore seeing the minister lawfully called is the mouth of christ we must take heed that we seeing a mortall man sinfull like to vs deliuer the word that we contemne it not for his sake but receiue the word as it is indeed the power of god though it come from a mortall man so paul commends the thessalonians who receiued his doctrine as the word of the euer liuing god besides seeing christ carieth his scepter in his mouth not in his hand we see his kingdom is not of this world not carnall but spirituall he gouerneth and ruleth his church and people by the sword of his mouth the eternall word of god published and preached by sinfull man like to vs this sheweth the abuse of that sword which the pope the vicar of christ chalengeth for he will haue both swords ciuil and ecclesiasticalls surely he is not the vicar and in the roome of christ for christ was content onely with the spirituall sword now followeth the conclusion of the epistle containing two parts the first a commandement let him which hath an eare heare the second a promise to him which ouercometh will i giue to eate of the manna ampc of the first i haue spoken before the end and scope of this commaundement is to stir vp the church to attention to marke the things propounded the first speciall point what is commaunded to be heard is the word of god which must not be heard with a bare and simple hearing but with knowledge faith beleefe and obedience in practise seeing he commaunds this hearing to all man we see it is the ordinance of god all man in the church should frequent sermons where this word of god is propounded and taught by plaine and simple man that they may better learne their dutie at a good time man wil come to the church though they come not halfe a yeare after but the ordinance of christ is that man should daily at all lawful occasions frequent sermons and come to the congregation and if we be his sheepe we will heare his voice ioh amp desire to heare his word taught by his mouth mat the word of god is called the key of the kingdome of heauen now as necessarie it is to haue the key to open heauen as to haue his soule brought thither paule calleth the doctrine of the gospell the word of reconciliation because the same by god grace reconcileth vs to him who being his enemy are made by it to be in his fauour then we must come to heare it daily not at christmas or such times alone for this is to magnifie those dayes aboue the lord day but man corrupt amp froward say for themselues tush if god or christ or his apostles wold preach to vs we wold come but when man speake to vs being sinfull and like our selues we will not ans it is the will and ordinance of god that his word should be published and preached to man by man like himselfe for since adams fall man could not abide to heare the maiestie of god the israelites seeing but a glimmering of god glorie could not abide it but said speake to vs by moses exod and he will haue his word preached by sinfull man to trie mans obedience and humilitie how he will receiue and obey the word of god deliuered by man againe he doth it to make loue betweene man and man when one man speaketh the word of god to another then are they presumptuous persons who dare oppose themselues against god most holy ordinance and will againe others say they haue the bible containing the sermons of christ the apostles and prophets and who can make better sermons then they now seeing they haue these at hand they need not come to the church but let these consider that as it is the ordinance and will of god to haue the bible so will he haue it expounded by man in the church that me might vnderstand it and so make vse of it in their liues as for some others they will not come to the church but hauing a iourney as they say they can serue god on their horse backe or in the way as well and with as good a heart as the best in the church but let these heare the word of god by the wisest man salomon pro he which turneth his eare from the law that is from hearing the word of god his prayers are abhominable and if he turne fro god god will turne from him and if man be wearie of his word god will be wearie of their seruice of all their prayers and other seruice where or whatsoeuer lastly many thinke they haue knowledge enough no man can teach them that they know not alreadie but the preaching of the word serueth not onely to beget knowledge but to increase the same and also to beget in man obedience to his knowledge so that these though they seeme to be the wisest are most foolish no man no not the greatest learned but he hath knowledge in part and it may be increased and say he get not more knowledge yet he may by the word deliuered by a plaine and simple man be brought to obedience of that he knoweth another principall dutie comanded in the conclusion is reading the word both in publike and priuate that so we may be prepared to heare and obey the same so christ luke what readest thou he taketh it for graunted that the young man could reade the lawe esay for want of god word and knowledge the people of god went into captiuitie and yet we see among vs many families which come to church heare the word nay receiue the sacraments not knowing the thing assured in them neither hauing a bible to reade nor procuring others if they cannot yet many haue a bible lying on their cupbord but vse it not the tables cards and dice they be well vsed and worne but the booke of god lyeth couered with dust many will haue the booke of satutes that they may know their dutie but none careth to haue the statutes of god to teach them to range their vnbridled affections within the compasse of the same and to him which ouercommeth here is the second part of the conclusion namely the promise which is the same in substance with those annexed with the two former epistles in this promise note two points first to whom it is made secondly what is promised first the persons to whom promise is made namely they which ouercome to ouercome as before is to beleeue to put all our trust and confidence in christ alone and to get victorie against all our spirituall enemy that we may ouercome so we must do two things first we must denie our selues and all that is in vs amp put our whole confidence in christ alone secondly we must maintaine true religion and a good conscience in all things to our last end and this is indeed to ouercome all our spirituall enemy now seeing god maketh this promise to them which ouercome we must labour to come to this estate that so we may be partakers of the promise the second point is the thing promised he will giue him to eate of the hidden manna ampc the thing promised is a threefold gift of god first to eate of that manna secondly he shall haue a white stone thirdly a new name written in the same white stone which three signifie our election vocation iustification sanctificatio amp glorification and to be the children of god to come to the first to eate of the hidden manna manna signifieth properly that food which god gaue the children of israell from heauen to feed them in the wildernesse psalm for the excellencie of it it is called the wheat of heauen and the foode of strong man or of angels in forme it was like coreander seed white and sweet as moses saith by which the lord fed them in the wildernesse fortie yeares from heauen to teach them man liueth not by bread onely but by the word of god and this is thought of many to be the same white manna sold in shops but i stand not on that and it is to be doubted but this manna signifieth another food corinthian it is the spirituall foode which our fathers did eate namely the food of our soul that is christ the true manna and bread of life which came from heauen john sheweth that christ is that food and spirituall meate of our soules feeding vs to eternall life ob but how can christ the son of god become our meat and food ans by these conclusions first christ is food not in respect of his doctrine or his miracles or in regard of his death passion or obedience alone but in regard of himselfe as he is christ god and man and here he is called the lord of life first in regard of himselfe then in regard of his benefites the second conclusion he is our food not as he lay in the cratch or as he is now in heauen but as he died was buried rose amp suffered the paines of hell dead christ crucified christ he is our food of life for fro his death cometh our life the third conclusion christ is food not in regard of his godhead or deitie but in regard of his manhood i say of his manhood not simply in it selfe but as it is in the godhead subsisting by the deitie as he is god and man so is his bodie and bloud our food yet christ is not a bodily and sensible food to be receiued with our hand mouth and into our stomacke but he is a spirituall food to be receiued onely by the hand of faith into the stomacke of our soules whereby they be fed to eternall life and thus we eate him when we beleeue and assure our selues that he was dead buried and crucified for vs in particular seeing christ crucified is the bread of life and the spirituall manna whereon our soules must feed we must long and hunger after christ spiritually as truly and sensibly as we do after meate and drinke we see when a man is famished he will eate his owne flesh teare and pull it off his armes to satisfie hunger now shall we thus pull our owne flesh and shall we not spend all we haue to haue this food of our soules in the hunger of the stomacke be two things first there is a paine in the nether part and bottome of the stomacke and from this there cometh a strong and hungrie appetite which lasteth till the belly and appetite be filled and satisfied so we should feele a paine in our hearts rising from the feare of god wrath for our sinnes and offences and withall we must feele an hungring and longing appetite to haue this paine taken away to haue this appetite satisfied which is onely by that food of the bodie and bloud of christ secondly there is besides that paine an appetite and longing after meate and an earnest desire to be satisfied now as the stomacke longeth after meate so should the stomacke of our soules feeling a paine long and haue an earnest appetite to be filled and satisfied in some sort neuer quiet till we haue got the bodie and bloud of christ which is the true food of our soules to satisfie our hungrie appetite but our case for the most part is miserable we haue a dead flesh growne ouer our hearts they be not touched with any paine of our wants and miseries but we must labour to see our hunger and want of christ for as they which be thus hungrie shall be fed so they which be full shall be sent emptie away oh they be blessed which hunger after christ they shall haue the bread of life and drinke of the well of life ioh seeing christ is the bread of life the true manna signified by that in the wildernesse we see the madnesse of most man in the world who seeke not for this spirituall manna of the soule which is farre better then that in the wildernesse but we like the israelites delight in onions and garlike and the flesh pots of egypt and are not we as prophane as they seeing we labor much to get earthly manna temporall food riches pleasure ampc but neuer seek to haue christ the food of our soules the bread of life yet these which do so be the wise me of the world we cout the of credit and happiest me but they be indeed prophane esawes preferring this temporall food before christ the food of eternal life we must then labour to detest this abhominable prophanesse seeing it is the very defacing of religion but christ shall take it in the highest disgrace when he seeth vs preferre bread which perisheth before this precious and eternall food of our soules and here in that christ meaneth by manna not corporal food but himselfe his owne body and blood for that corporall foode was but a signe of this we see the signe in the sacrament is put for the thing signified manna for the body of christ christ addeth the hidden manna to put a distinction betweene the earthly manna which the israelites and all might see feele and eate and christ who is the hidden manna and whom euery one cannot see it is called hidden first because no man by nature can haue this foode no naturall man can see will or desire it secondly because god reuealeth not this spirituall food namely christ effectually to all man math the wise and prudent cannot know it it is reuealed onely to god children seeing christ is the hidden manna we see the estate of man in the world yes in the church of god they know not christ the true bread of life they feele no want of this food because they know it not for a man cannot know truly what food is till he stand in need of it amp feele the want of it nay not onely the people but preachers though they know christ in a mentall knowledge yet they know not him as they should they feele no want of christ to be their sauiour to deliuer them from the wrath of god to feed their starued and famished soules and to deliuer them from the gulfe of hell then we must not content our selues with knowledge swimming in the braine but labour to know our wants to feele our misery to seeke to haue christ the food of our soules to deliuer vs from the misery and wretched estate we are in by it to labour to get but one drop of bloud to satisfie our hungry and starued soules and as one which is starued with hunger would seeke to haue meate so we must haue experimentall knowledge that we can say in conscience i see and feele how i want christ to feed my soule seeing christ is the hidden manna god offereth him not to all man in generall for then he should not be hid as he is from many therefore there is no vniuersal election no vniuersal grace offered effectually to all man in particular the second gift is a white stone where christ borroweth a phrase of speech from the gentiles to whom he wrote the gentiles vsed these stones in iudgement for when man were iudged the iudges gaue them either a white stone which was a token of absolution or a blacke stone which was a signe of condemnation secondly they vsed these stones to trie whether such a day or such should be luckie as they say or vnluckie for if they tooke a white stone out of their vessel then it was a token of good lucke if a black then of bad now here it is vsed for the first christ promiseth a white stone that is pardon and absolution from sinnes and from the punishment of sinne euen eternall damnation to them which ouercome beleeue labour to maintaine and defend faith and a good conscience let these go on to the end for they shall haue this white stone now then if any would know whether he haue pardon and absolution of his sins here is the note and marke if he beleeue in christ labour to maintaine faith and a good conscience then he hath this white stone promised him then we must labour for these that so the other may be sealed to vs the third gift is a new name written in the same stone this name is to be god child so the same apostle expounds it john behold what great loue god sheweth vs euen to be called his sonnes this is the name he giueth to them which ouercome to be called his sonnes and heires with christ now seeing god giueth this new name to his children it must not be an idle name but the lord giueth with it a new conditio whereby we are made the sonnes and heires of god so when abraham was new named abraham it was for a speciall purpose for then he began to be the father of the faithfull when iacob was called israel it was for a speciall end so we hauing a new name must haue a new condition which is to be called the sonnes and heires of god in christ now this is a most excellent prerogatiue for then we haue christ our elder brother and our fellow heire god our father the angels to defend and guide vs all things and meanes of this life to our benefite god speciall prouidence to guide vs and being god childre our sins are no sins but a meanes to come to felicitie and our death is no death but a litle doore to passe to life this is the new condition god giueth with our new name written in the white stone that is in the pledge of absolution for here the white stone and new name go together for looke whom he absolueth he giueth a new name and new condition for he which hath his sinnes pardoned is a new creature a new man the white stone and new name go together and are written in each other then man must haue them both and not as most do say they hope christ is their sauiour he will pardon their sinnes and yet continue in them amp take occasion by that to sinne for christ if he giue the white stone that is pardon of sinne he giueth with it a new name and a new condition of life which no man knoweth some might obiect doth he giue man new names why then do we not call them by their names answer he saith no man knoweth it but he which hath it that is in that maner and certainty as he which receiues it for no man can know or discerne it then man must not thinke strange though be be not called by this new name the world knoweth vs not john now in that he which hath this new name knowes it and seeth that he is the child of god and fellow heire with christ that he is called iustified sanctified and that none knowes it but he which hath receiued it this cofutes the papists who say they know it but not certainly but in hope and by coniecture and probabilitie but we see he knowes it certainly infallibly without doubt for he knowes it better then any other other man know it by coniecture but he knoweth it certainly no man knowes this new name so certainly amp infallibly and fro within as he which receiues the same for no man can determine of the faith adoption or calling of any but himself for that is proper to god to search the heart this must stay our censure and iudgement to iudge man to be hypocrites to condemne either the better or bad sort of man for we know not a mans heart his faith is but knowne to god and himselfe obiect how farre may we iudge of anothers state of saluation answer we iudge of another mans estate either certainly or not certainly as when one iudgeth and sets downe certainly and resolutely that such man are elected to saluation without all doubt but this is proper to god no man can know the spirit of man but god and the man himself and so farre as it pleaseth him to reueale the same to some of his children as to dauid he reuealed the damnation and reiection of some for which cause he prayeth for their destruction now besides this there is the iudgement of charitie when we iudge of another as charitie moueth vs now charitie maketh a man iudge the best this charitie hath two parts first it is not to despaire secondly it is to iudge of a mans saluation vndoubtedly to be perswaded of it certainly we must not despaire though we see man liue in sin and we must iudge certainly of mens saluation and without doubt that they be called effectually in that they testifie their faith by their obedience not that we can set down certainly but we must in charitie iudge so of them and this is charitie in the highest degree when we iudge that such a one is the child of god by the fruites of his faith here again they of the church of rome are deceiued making the church to haue this note and property to be visible but not visibilitie but election adoption and faith are the principall markes of the church now these cannot be seene onely the fruites of them may and to the angell here beginneth the fourth particular epistle the end amp scope of these words is to certifie the church of thyatyra that john had a speciall commandement and calling from god first to write this epistle secondly to certifie all churches to the end of the world that he had a commandement and calling from god to write not onely this epistle but this whole booke and for that cause this is seuen times repeated to the angell ampc the epistle beginneth here these things write ampc and continueth almost to the end of this chapter in it note three parts first a preface secondly a proposition thirdly a conclusion the preface or entrance in the eighteenth verse all which were in the former chapter verses these things saith in the preface note first in whose name it is written namely in the name of christ the cause why his name is in the preface is set downe before christ is described by three arguments first he is the son of god secondly his eyes are like a flame of fire thirdly his feet like fine brasse christ is here said to be the son of god in the former chapter he was called the son of man here the son of god by god he meaneth not the godhead as it is absolutely or common to all the three persons but by it is meant the father who when he is conferred with any person in the trinitie is called god not that he is more god then the son and holy ghost or that they be not equall but for order in that he is the first person amp fro him the godhead is comunicated to the son and holy ghost how christ is called the son of god we may know by these two rules first christ is the son of the father not in respect of his godhead or as he is god but in respect of his person and in respect of his person he is begotten of the father before all worlds for the godhead of christ the son is not begotten or begetteth not nor proceedeth but he hath one and the same godhead with the father therefore it no more begetteth or is begotten or proceeding then his the second rule christ is the son of the father not by creation as the angels and adam nor by grace as true beleeuers in christ but by nature in that he is begotten of the substance of the father before all worlds because the father comunicated to him from himself his whole godhead and nature and by this communication of the godhead to his son wholly he is said to beget the son and he is said to be begotten of the father the end why christ is called the son of god is namely to stirre vp in this church of thyatira care and diligence reuerence and attention in marking and obeying the things of this epistle seeing that he which teacheth them is the son of god teaching vs in their example when we heare the word read or preached we must haue attention diligent care and feare seeing it is the son of god which speaketh to vs when pilate was condemning christ and heard he was the son of god he was affraid shall an heathen man which knew not god feare to heare of christ the son of god and shall not we tremble to heare him speake to vs himselfe at the voice of christ the mountaines melted and the rockes claue asunder and shall not our stonie and rockie hearts tremble to heare him speake to vs out of his word his eyes were like a flame of fire we must not take these words literally but as in the former chapter for christ is set out as he appeared in vision to john by his fierie eye is meant first that in him is infinite wisedome he seeth all things he knoweth by his fierie and piercing eye all things present past and to come secondly it signifieth his vigilancie and watchfulnesse ouer his church and euery particular member of the same for these two ends first to preserue and protect his own children secondly to take reuenge and punishment on his enemy thirdly by his fierie eye is signified his anger against sinnes and sinners christ is said to haue fierie eyes to teach vs that he can discerne secret and hidden sinnes for in this chapter we find that certaine man in this church were giuen to fornication and idolatry close and hidden sinnes now here he is said to haue fierie eyes to shew them he seeth these secret sinnes he knoweth their hearts much more their sinfull workes and will punish them then by this we haue a good remedie against all secret sins the nature of man is for shame and feare of punishment to abstaine from outward crimes but being out of the company of man he will breake the commandement of the first and second table without any care or conscience and this euery mans conscience can best testifie that though he can abstaine from outward sinnes for shame and punishment yet he will comit secret sinnes but these man should remember that though they be out of the presence of man yet they stand in the presence of christ he seeth them his fierie eye pierceth to their inward thoughts and affections and though they may bleare the eyes of man yet they cannot bleare this fierie eye of christ if euery man would remember this the fornicator blasphemer or any sinner it would be a good meanes to bridle and stay the from committing sinnes both open and hidden and his feet like fine brasse he is said to haue brazen feet to shew his strength and power by which he ouercame and bruised the head of the serpent on the crosse and fully vanquished hell death and sinne by his death and also doth subdue sinne and satan and put them vnder not onely his brazen foot but vnder the feet of his servant and members the end why he is said to haue feet of brasse here in this epistle is to terrifie certaine wicked persons in this church as fornicators and idolaters nay the whole church of thyatira which by these wicked man were in daunger to be drawne that way this then may be a remedie for all loose liuers namely to consider of christs brazen feet to thinke that christ our sauiour is in the midst of the church walketh there and that he hath a foote of brasse to trample and tread all his enemy to powder and to destroy them the want of this is the cause why man lie in sinne and heape sinne vpon sinne without care or conscience or any feare the second part of the epistle is the proposition wherein is propounded the substance and matter of the epistle it hath two parts first a praise secondly a dispraise or rebuke the commendation in the verse the dispraise in the verse first she is commended generally i know thy workes secondly particularly for many duties and vertues i know thy workes that is i see and allow thy workes and wayes the end why he alleadgeth and repeateth these words is to stirre vp the hearts of his servant to consider of his presence for christ before hath fierie eyes and here he saith i know thy workes to make this consideration to sinke more deepely and imprint it more throughly in the second part he commendeth her for many duties and vertues first loue secondly seruice thirdly patience fourthly faith and increase of godlinesse first she is commended for loue that is loue to man not to god for for that she is comended after in the duties to god but by loue and seruice is meant duties to man performed by man to man to know this loue better note three points first what it is secondly the property of true loue to man thirdly how it must be practised toward man loue to man is a gift of god spirit whereby a man is well affected to his neighbour for god sake first loue is the gift of the spirit gal secondly it is a gift whereby a man is well affected to his neighbour that is to reioyce at his good to defend to seeke and wish his good yes to be grieued with his hurt and miserie and withall to haue bowels of compassion to helpe him in his hurt and miserie thirdly it must be to our neighbour not by dwelling or habitation but to them which be our brother in nature haue the same flesh with vs amp beare the same image of god then all man as they be man are our neighbours though they dwell at the worlds end whether beleeuer or infidell friend or foe to these we must be wel affected fourthly it must be for god sake for god must first absolutely and principally be loued and man for him so that our loue to man is a fruit of our loue to god springing and descending from it as for the propertie of our loue to man it must be feruent and that in two things first if need require euery man is bound in the compasse of his calling to lay downe his life for his brother and for his neighbour ioh secondly it must be feruent towards our enemy in the world there is much hatred malice and iniuries now we must loue those persons from who these come and loue must be feruent that these like water do not quench it and for the practise of our loue to man the rule is that we loue him as our selues as we loue and wish well to our selues heartily so must we loue and wish well to him this is the law of nature to do to another as we would haue him to do to vs yes this is the law of god do to all man as you would haue them do to you is a man to sell the diuell offereth him gaine if he wil lie now consider by thine owne law wouldest thou haue another to deceiue thee by lying no surely then deceiue not thy neighor by false weights wares or otherwise by these three things we see for what this church was commended this loue were to be wished in vs but alas it waxeth cold euery man is a louer of himselfe seeketh his owne good no man his brothers euery man spends his labor wit and his calling to help himself no man to do good to others to help the common good or the good of the church but to the hurt or hindering of others for man think they may make the best of their owne sell as deare as they can but we should employ all our callings if we had true loue not onely to our owne good but the good of others euen the common good of the towne country or church when man come to the church to heare the word to pray to receiue the sacrament then they seeme to shew great loue of god but look into their callings there is no loue of their brother which sheweth they haue no true but an outward loue of god seeing they loue not their neighbour liue by iniustice seeking to fley him and draw out his very bloud by cruell dealing by griping pilling and polling now there cannot be true loue of god where this loue of our neighbour is wanting john the second vertue for which this church is comended is seruice in this place it is a vertue and work of loue whereby a christian man becomes a servant to euery man for his good this is commended and described heb paul gal commaunds vs to do seruice one to another by loue corinthian loue seekes not her owne but the good of others so christ john commaunds his to be servant one to another in those good things which god giueth vs as we must do them good in all we can so one speciall dutie here mentioned is to be ready to releeue according our abilitie the want of the church for we must haue first loue and charitie then seruice as a braunch springing from loue heb which is when we are ready to bestow our goods or gifts which god giueth vs to the good of the church especially the godly in the church this were to be wished in england but it is not seeing the richest sort bestow their goods in hawks hounds beares buls dogs and other their pleasure and pastime but when any comes to be bestowed on the poore then they be strait handed all comes as hardly fro the as a rib out of their side we see man can be content yearely to bestow much money in playes pastimes and other delights and that with zeale and earnestnes but come to the poore our owne flesh to our brother who beares the same image of god as we do here we sticke and from winter to winter suffer them to starue for want of that which our dogs haue to moue man to help the poore first see how man in the old testament were charged with offerings first fruites sacrifices and many other ceremonies now these be ended but instead of that altar the poore they be the altar whereon we must offer our burnt offerings amp our sacrifices secondly esay he which imparts his heart to the poore that is seeing him in want hath his heart touched with the bowels of compassion and testifies his loue in releeuing his want this man hath a happie promise his name shall not be put out but shine for euer and this is true religion to visit the fatherlesse and widow to comfort and releeue them iam prou he which giueth to the poore lendeth to the lord now the lord he comes in his person to borow he makes the pore his stewards to gather it in wilt thou say him nay to lend him of his owne thou wilt not wouldest thou haue him stay or send his steward away emptie again christ comes in their person he askes an almes he saith in their person i am hungry naked fatherles and motherles and in them he stands crauing at our doores now if we would escape that horrible sentence of condemnation away from me ampc let vs not say him nay or deny him but if we wil be liberall in any thing and bestow largely on any thing bestow it on the poore our owne flesh and so we lend to god who is the best paymaster and we giue to christ who will not let it be vnrewarded now followeth the third particular vertue for which christ commends the church of thyatira which is faith that is fidelitie whereby we are faithfull to god in keeping our promise made to him in baptisme wherein we promise to renounce our selues to beleeue in god three persons one true god to obey him all our life time this is commaunded tim now it would be wished that our church might be commended for this fidelitie but it cannot for though it be a common thing among vs to sweare by our faith yet there is litle faith in our hearts yes litle care to keepe this fidelitie promised in baptisme for some of vs lie in ignorance neuer knowing what promise we haue made to god and such are many among vs young olde high low rich amp poore others they haue no care of goodnes of heauen or heauenly things but of eating drink sporting in which they spend their days neuer thinking of christ or of their promise to him a third sort are those which we account honest and wise man but they come short indeed for these set their hearts on riches and the things of this world spend their strength and wit in the getting of them and haue their hearts glued to them they like molds are euer in the earth we call them i say honest man but indeed they deny god forsake their first faith and fidelitie to god in baptisme and in stead of the true god erect an idoll euen their riches and of these we haue great heapes then it stands vs in hand often to remember our promise in baptisme to renounce our selues amp the things of this world to beleeue in christ to performe obedience to him in al our life for if we go on and stil deny our first faith nothing belongs to vs but condemnation the fourth vertue is patience whereof we haue heard in this and the former chapter here marke how patienc is ioyned with loue to man faith to god and seruice to man and god the reason is because no good action can be done of any man without patience loue and faith without it are nothing for if a man do his dutie to man he shall be sure to be hated now without patience he ceaseth to do his dutie so if a man beleeue in god and professe the same the world contemnes him now without patience he canot perseuere constantly patience is the effect of faith rom faith brings forth hope and mat the good ground brings forth fruit but in patience all that a man doth if it be done acceptable to god it must be ioyned with patience then we must in all our gifts and graces ioyne patience with our hope faith loue knowledge ampc pet no grace can shew it selfe without this a man cannot endure the crosse without it and thy workes christ before had said the same here he repeateth it againe which is not idle for no word in scripture is idle but by this christ shewes his exceeding approbation of the workes of this church of thyatira that they were such as he liked of not in a meane but in exceeding great measure the cause why he liked them so followeth afterward now seeing christ repeates these words after foure worthy vertues he doth it to shew vs what things are required to a good worke namely faith loue seruice patience and fidelity for to do a worke to god we must ioyne these foure vertues and therfore christ addeth these words both before and after these vertues first faith is required because in doing any actio euery ma must shew his fidelitie to god which we do when before we do any worke we search the word of god whether it be commanded or forbidden there for no worke we do can please god vnlesse we be perswaded out of the word that it is lawful nay being not of faith it is sin rom secondly our works must not proceed from faith alone but from faith and loue ioyntly together for faith worketh by loue and though a man do neuer so good things if not in loue it is nothing corinthian thirdly a speciall seruice is required to god and man for all our workes must be done in seruice to man for the end of our callings be to do seruice to man and withal in doing seruice to man to please and serue god paul commaunds servant to please their masters in the lord as seruing him so of all man it is vnderstood that they in doing the workes of their calling must do them in seruice to man and withall to serue god column this ouerthroweth the papists fasting praying pilgrimage hard attire and whipping themselues to pray to saints and offer to them for these come not from faith and loue neither are they done in seruice to man to do them good in soule or body for these neither benefit themselues nor other last of all patience is requisite that a man may haue constancy and perseuerance for no man can do a good worke as he ought but many will mocke and iest at him he shall haue many crosses by wicked man euen by god prouidence now that he might be constant patience is necessarie that so as the good ground he may bring foorth fruit but in patience to apply this euery man in doing any thing in his particular calling must labour to shew these foure vertues his faith to god loue to man his seruice to god and man and haue patience to vndergo all troubles which come by doing his dutie for if a man do the worke of his particular calling be it neuer so base yet it is as good a worke to god in it kind as to preach the word and to giue almes the fifth vertue is that her workes were mo at last then at first the church of ephesus was discommended for her decay in loue but here christ commendeth this church for increase in godlinesse and vertue it were to be wished that our church might be commended for this vertue but alas it cannot for the bodie of our people are in number increased but litle in practise and obedience heb they indeed in regard of the time might be teachers hauing so long heard the word but yet they need to be taught euen the principles of religion for though they heare daily yet is there no knowledge no increase of zeale or of repentance no going on in grace tim they are euer learning yet neuer come to knowledge this is a common fault in all estates man heare much learne litle and practise lesse nay we haue a worse fault for many among vs hauing heard good things go backward loose them become worse or else stand at a stay and this is our shame that many places which heare the wordlesse go before vs in knowledge faith obedience and repentance then if we would auoide god wrath and discommendation let vs now increase it is not enough for old man to say they cannot though their memorie faile yet they must labour to haue good and zealous affections young man must employ their strength and wit and memorie in this to increase in grace amp not to quench any grace but to stirre the vp for to him which hath is giuen but fro him which hath not is taken away that he had then all must labor to go on in grace that the teacher may haue comfort and the hearers be freed from shame and discommendation notwithstanding i haue something against thee here christ after his high commendation rebuketh the church of thyatira first the whole church secondly a certaine woman in the church the rebuke concerning the whole church is in the twentieth verse in which is first the reproofe it selfe secondly the reason of it neuerthelesse that is though i haue hitherto commended thee yet thou hast something which i like not but greatly dislike of this i haue spoken before secondly the reason of the reproofe because thou sufferest the woman iesabell to teach that is because they suffered a certain woman namely iesabel in the assemblies to teach and seduce the people first obserue in these words the great power and authority which this church had giuen her of god for besides the power of preaching the word and administration of the sacraments she had power to appoint who should preach who shold not and further authoritie to restraine wicked man and woman by her seuere gouernment the like power was in the church of ephesus amp so of al churches in preaching of the word amp administration of the sacraments to appoint who shold preach and who not and also to restraine wicked man that they commit not what wickednesse they will in the congregation and this authoritie hath the lord giuen to all churches nay without this no church can continue or stand and it is not sufficient to haue rule in the congregation but seuere gouernment wherby wicked man may be kept in order and because this church vsed not this power therefore she is discommended now in euery church where the word is preached and sacraments administred there they haue the same power yet we see how sin abounds fornication adulterie blasphemie vsurie drunkennesse and all for want of this gouernment which should represse such sinnes this church sinned first in suffering a woman to teach secondly to seduce the people of god this word teach signifieth to teach publikely in the assemblies then they sinned in suffering a woman iesabel to teach publikely in the open assemblies of man for tim i permit not a woman to teach corinthian they must keepe silence but it may obiected first that deborah and huldah were prophetesses ans they were extraordinarie and we may not make an ordinarie rule vpon extraordinarie actions secondly corinthian if a woman pray or prophecie ans first there were such in the infancie of the church and were extraordinarie secondly they did sinne and as a fault it is rebuked in the fourteenth chapter where he commaundeth woman to be silent thirdly woman are said to pray because they giue assent to the minister praying saying amen and to prophecie by singing psalmes and reading scripture for so much the word prophecie signifieth being taken largely so chronicle asaph is said to prophecie when he sung with instruments of musicke in the congregation seeing christ rebuketh them for suffering a woman to teach in the congregation we see it is not warrantable that she should administer the sacrament of baptisme no not in the time of necessitie for the word and sacraments go together now christ will not haue a woman to preach the word therefore not to administer the sacraments and though woman be forbidden to teach in the congregation yet they must teach at home salomon he learned many lessons of his mother who taught him at home prou so tim timothy was taught by his grandmother lois and eunice his mother in the scriptures but hence some gather without ground that as a woma may not teach so not gouern but this cannot be proued out of the word and it hath no force for though a woman may not teach and stand in christs stead in the congregation yet she may gouerne and stand in his stead in the common wealth be a queene dutchesse countesse ampc for there is special reason why she may not stand in christs stead in the church seeing man onely so stand in his stead for christ tooke on him the person of a man not of a woman but that letteth not but she may stand in his stead in the commonwealth if she come to it by succession seeing it is her patrimonie and inheritance and we haue great cause to blesse almightie god for the gouernment of a woman more then any which euer yet ruled ouer vs but it is said the man is the womans head therefore he must beare rule not she ans he is the head that is more excellent as he is man but not in regard of any gifts for a woman may passe a man in grace and gifts of god and other respects and so may haue rule ouer the man though he be more excellent as he is man she inferiour as she is woman the second fault reproued in the church of thyatira is the suffering of a woman to teach and seduce then as to suffer a woman to teach openly in the church is a fault so to suffer her to seduce is a fault likewise seeing christ reproueth them for suffering her we see it is not left to mans will to teach and hold what he will but man must be restrained that they teach and hold nothing which standeth not with the word of god they must reproue patrons and defenders of sects and schismes and new doctrines for which our church is to be commended which hath lawes for papists protestant and recusants which is both lawful and commended by christ to aggrauate these two faults he describeth her by her properties first that she is called iesabel that is one like iesabel secondly by her action she called her selfe a prophetesse first the woman iesabel but why doth christ call her so first because this woman was like iesabel and did in her person reuiue the wicked manners and opinions of iesabel for as iesabel was an idolater brought in idolatry amp the worship of baal among the israelites so this woman in the church of thyatyra secondly as she was giuen to fornication so this woman was a maintainer and teacher of the same thirdly as iesabel was a woman of authoritie and by her authoritie did countenance and defend her sinnes false religion and the worship of baal so this woman was also of great authoritie and by the same taught and maintained her diuellish opinions in this reason see the practise of the diuell who laboureth in ages following to renew and reuiue the vices and sinnes which were before amp their errors for as he had iesabel in ahabs time who was a patron of fornication and idolatry so in the apostles time he had this woman who renewed these opinions another iesabel like her the end is to further his kingdom for the diuell seeth that these meanes most dishonour god hurt his kingdome and most of all build his kingdom and so he dealeth in al ages to reuiue the opinions errors amp scismes of old so they which follow machiauel imitate the doings of achitophel so the papists reuiue the errors of the scribes and pharises they which separate themselues fro our church the opinio of the donatists the family of loue the error of the valetinians the second reason is because by this name he might draw the to dislike of her and not to follow her but that she might be in as great disgrace as iesabel was in the old testament and this christ doth to teach vs in reading the bookes of the old and new testament if we reade of any wiked man that we should dislike their vices and errors take heed of them and auoid them nay if we see them in vs we must dislike our selues for them and contrarily if we reade of a vetruous man or woman we must imitate their vertues like and loue them and our selues for them if we haue the same the second argument whereby he describes her is her action which calleth her selfe a prophetesse that is she doth chalenge to her selfe to be such a one as taught the word by the instinct and help of god spirit and that all she taught was the word of god spirit she taught fornication was no sinne and that one might go into the idoll temple and eate of their offerings and yet she pretends all to be done and taught by god spirit making him the teacher and author of her errors seeing wicked man and woman father their errors on god spirit we must labour to get the spirit of discerning to know whether the spirit be of god or not and we must not be of no religion because many teach false doctrine but rather labour to haue the spirit of discerning to try the spirits which we heare againe when we are accused or slandered we must be content for we see this woman taught false doctrine and yet fathered it on god spirit which indeed was not of him but of the diuell and so made him the author of errors now if the lord be thus dealt withall made the author of lies by wicked man shall not we be content if we be slaundered who by our sinnes deserued the same as she chalenged her selfe to be a prophetesse so she proued her selfe to be one namely by her owne testimony and her owne word she said she was one here christ sheweth the note of a false prophet namely a mans owne word and testimony but a true prophet hath many tokens and arguments to proue him to be so as in the primitiue church they spake sundry tongues without study often wrought miracles as seales of a true prophet secondly they held vnitie of doctrine in integritie of life and conuersation to confirme their callings thirdly they had excellent gifts giuen them of god as zeale courage and constancy to maintaine their callings which were extraordinary but this woman had nothing but her owne word and bare testimony in the second place the more to disgrace her and the church of thyatira her teaching was described by the end which was to deceiue man here is another marke of a false prophet to teach to seduce and draw man to some sinne or wickednesse the end of true teaching is godlynes but of false it is to draw man to sinne in life and conuersation after he describeth her seducing by two arguments first the persons my servant secondly the meanes to make them commit fornication and to eate of things offered to idols for the persons my servant this increaseth her fault seeing they were excellent me the servant of christ hence arise two questions first why some man be rather the servant of christ then other some secondly whether the servant of christ can be seduced for the first some say god would haue euery man in the world his servant amp doth what he can to make them so he calleth them redeemeth them giueth them grace to be his children reconcileth the to himself so that they may if they will be saued now some will not for all this receiue god grace but contemne his mercy though he call them redeeme them and giue them grace but this is against common sense to make god will in subiection amp mans will to rule to disgrace god and set man aloft to make god will to be ordered by mans will but the reason why some are the servant of god not al is god good pleasure in electing some and reiecting others for he electeth not all to grace and glory but some onely and these be his servant by reason of his owne good will and pleasure act as many as were ordained to life that is elected and redeemed of god free will and pleasure they beleeued the second question is whether a servant of god can be seduced answer servant be of two sorts some are only in appearance some in deed and truth those be onely in appearance which receiue the word and outward seales but not the inward fruite and these be in our churches the greatest part these may fall away finally and wholly as did the galathians and many other but those which be in truth the servant of christ though they may fall in part yet they cannot fall wholy or finally mat the gates of hel shal striue amp shew their strength against that rocke of faith but shall not preuaile so we pray leade vs not into temptation that is let vs neuer be wholly vnder the power of satan now what we pray for that we haue a promise in the worde for it and true faith and a constant purpose to liue in any on sinne cannot stand together for faith purifieth the heart and preserueth it in life and death ergo a true beleeuer cannot fall wholly or finally to come to the meanes of discerning them it is by committing fornicatio and eating things offered to idols she made the servant of god to sinne by these two sinnes and meanes which shewes she was a maintainer of the sect of the nicolaitanes of whom i spake before and i gaue her space to repent christ reproued the church of thyatira before for suffering her here he reproueth her for her obstinacy and hardnes of heart that she would not repent of her sinnes time to repent that is though her sinnes deserued present death yet god suffered her to liue in the world a space of time to see if she would repent now in her example he teacheth vs how to vse time whilest we liue in the world namely seeing it is giuen vs of god to repent in and so to come to saluation we must vse it so amp repet while we haue time for that cause he lets some liue twenty or forty yeares for there is no repentance before we come into this world or after we go out therefore while we liue in it we must repent then we must thinke of it earnestly that we vse it to repent in that so we may be reconciled to god receiued to mercy and haue the kingdome of heauen then damnable is the practise of our daies when man liue in eating drink sporting carding amp dicing in spending their strength and wit in getting riches neuer thinking of the true end why they liue which is to repent and come to saluatio but spend their time he giues them to repent other wayes the lord might cut them off as soone as they be borne yet he suffereth them to liue to see if they will repent then if they runne on in sin they increase their damnation and do as a man should euery day cary a faggot for ten yeares to one heape and be burned himselfe with them at the end i gaue her namely christ gaue her time to repent no creature no man or angel can dispose of the time of repentance but only christ iesus it is in his power alone when one must repent or not then seeing it is not in our power it is best for vs to repent without delay while it is called to day the yong man takes his swinge because he is yong as though he could repet in old age or when he list but he robs christ of his honor for he alone can dispose of the time of repentance then take the present who knoweth when the lord will cut him off and then his estate is miserable we thinke a man may repent at the last gaspe but it is not good for a man to deferre seeing he may die quietly by reason of the sicknesse yet may die out of god fauour but to whom gaue christ this time to her that is iesabel a wicked woman here we see the endles mercy of god in christ iesus he offereth mercy to iesabel a leud wicked fornicator amp idolater a blasphemous wretch fathering her sinnes on the spirit of god yet she hath mercy offered so the lord dealeth not in iustice to cut man off but giueth grieuous sinners time to repent so did he to manaesses a wisard and idolater who humbling himselfe was receiued to mercy salomon an idolater yet repenting was receiued to mercy for he was a pen man of the scripture ergo an holy man pet isay the iewes a sinfull people as ill as they which were in hel the sodomites and gomorrheans they had mercy offered if they would repent and though their sins were as red as crimson yet god would wash them as white as snow we may not hence take occasion to sinne but they which be grieuous sinners must not despaire if they can repent they shall haue mercy of her fornication she had sundry sinnes especially idolatry which cannot want company for no sinne goeth alone christ calleth her to repent for that one sinne of fornication because that was the most principall sin the head sinne of that woman teaching vs that when we repent we must begin with our greatest sins which most clog our conscience and by which we offend most againe he which can repent truly of one great sin he repents of all if he hate the greater he will hate the less then we in repentance must begin at the greater sin and repent in particular for it for confused repentance is not true as to say i am a sinner ampc but repentance in particular for particular sinnes beginning at the head sinne which most troubleth vs that is true repentance seeing christ saith he gaue her time to repent hence the papists gather free will namely to do good and to repent for else this admonition were in vaine but it followes not for god gaue her time to repent and commaundement to repent for other ends first that then he may with the time giue grace also to repent that so she and we may see what we should do and withall see our owne want that we are not able to do as we are commaunded and so to make vs inexcusable and she repented not here iesabels sinne is set downe namely impenitency and going on in her sins of fornication and idolatry concerning which sins note two things first where impenitency is forbidden secondly how great a sin it is first where it is forbidden ans there are two parts of the word the law and the gospell and these two be seuered and distinct neither can be mingled one with the other now the law comands things which we in that nature of man in which adam was could haue fulfilled but the gospell commaunds things aboue nature the law cannot command repentance seeing it reuealeth not repentance but the gospell commaunds it and so by an euangelicall commaundement this sin is forbidden as for the second part how great this sinne is know we that when man liue and go on in their sins it is a great sin seeing by it man heape vp sinne and wrath to themselues some say it is a sin against the holy ghost but it is vntrue for that is a blasphemy so is not impenitency that is in this life but impenitency properly is at death hence the papists gather againe that a man hath free will seeing he gaue her time to repent but she would not ans she had free will to sinne as all man haue and so to be impenitent but it followes not that she had free wil to do good amp to repent without god speciall grace that which christ said of iesabel may be said of our church and most man among vs he giueth vs long time to repent ten twenty or thirty yeares not one of a hundred repents we care not to heare the word and receiue the sacraments we will not turne to god truly but lie in sin in ignorance in contempt of the word in prophanation of the sabbath couetousnesse adultery idlenesse drink and eating so that our liues tell plainly not one of a thousand turnes to god truly now christ hauing reproued the church and iesabel from the to the verse he giueth speciall counsell to them both the end of his counsell is to direct them how to auoide the iudgement of god both in this and the life to come the counsell of christ hath two parts the first concerneth the woman iesabel and her company the second the church of thyatira the counsell concerning her is in the and verses the summe of it is to repent thou iesabel and thy company and disciples repent of your sins this is not expressed but in stead therof is the reason verse the reason is this if thou wilt not repent i will punish thee with sundry iudgements but thou wouldst not be punished with sundry iudgements therefore repent behold i will this is the reason in which note two parts first a threatning secondly an exception except they repent of their workes before the threatning christ sets this note of attention this should teach her amp vs to cosider seriously of iudgements against sin and sinners in the written word of god iosias when the law was read his heart melted which was at the threatnings of the law king so when peter preached the iewes were pricked in heart because he told them of the fearefull iudgement due to them for killing the lord of life act so should we with iosias be humbled at the serious consideration of god threatnings against sin and be moued to repent and the cause why sin is so rife is because man thinke not earnestly or else regard not god iudgements against sin and sinners the threatning hath three parts according to three estates the first concerning iesabel i will cast her into a bed we may gather the meaning of these words by those sam of ionadab to amnon ly down on thy bed and faine thy self sick so here i i will cast her into a bed that is strike her with some great sicknes the place namely the bed put for the sicknes which is in the man lying on the bed iesabel tooke pleasure in the bed by fornication who abusing the bed the lord to punish her in the bed accordingly gaue her sicknes in the same bed which she abused here is god dealing with sinners he punisheth them in those things they haue abused iesabel abused the bed to fornicatio the lord punished her in the bed with some great disease and sicknes diues abused his tongue and tast in god creatures amp he is punished in them luke he asked a drop of water to coole his tongue gamesters take pleasure in abusing time and spend it in carding and dicing their punishment it brings many iudgements on them they come to ruine and misery ahab to get the vineyard sheds bloud the lord sheds his iesabels and his childrens and they which liue by the bloud of the poore amp draw it out of them are punished with the like for bloud will haue bloud and the lord will punish man in those sins wherein they tooke most pleasure then this should admonish vs to take heed we abuse no creature of god for the lord he will turne the same to our punishment i will cast her that is strike her with some grieuous sicknes here we see the author of sicknes it is not by chance but comes from the hand of god if man could learne this they would make better vse of sicknesse if man could say the lord hath cast me on my bed visited my body with sicknes he hath done it for some of my sins to humble me and make me repent then they would find in their recouery a blessing and liue a new life esay hezekiah when he lay on his death bed knew it came from the lord amp therfore hearing esay say he must die he turned him to the wall and wept as for other things so especially for his sins and craued pardon for them so iacob lying on his bed leaned on his staffe sate vp and prayed for pardon of his sins and to testifie his faith and hope to god so should we in our sicknesse shew our faith and hope and pray for pardon of sinnes committed against him the second part of the threatning which concernes her disciples and followers which receiued her doctrine and committed fornication with her and their punishment is to be cast into great affliction we see it is a great sin to commit fornication and not a trick or slip of youth as we call it seeing christ assignes a great punishment to it againe we see some causes why townes cities and country be afflicted with much famine sword and pestilence namely because there be fornicators and maintainers of errors and superstition for god sends these iudgements as for other sins so for fornication sodom was destroyed for this sin and euen in our time we haue plagues famin sword many sicknesses and that for this sin among the rest corinthian many were dead for this sin lest they shold come defiled to the lord table now followes the exception except they repent here we see all god iudgements and threatnings be with exception in the matter of saluation and seeing christ ads this exception vnlesse they repent we see man of yeares condemned in the church not so much for sin as liuing in sin without repentance indeed the least sin makes a man subiect to condemnation but lying in sin that brings actual condemnation amp the wrath of god vpon vs so that if man commit sinne and lie in it he casts his soule away to commit sinne is not that which killeth vs but to lye in sinne for if a man sinne and after repent he shall haue mercie at god hands secondly it is propounded in the midst of the threates for they go before this exception and come after where we see god mingleth his mercie with iudgement he sheweth not all iudgement nor all mercie but tempereth them together now in that the lord will bring iudgement on them vnlesse they repent we see that repentance preuenteth temporall iudgement we haue had long peace and haue abused it to commit sinne now we must looke for god iudgements and we see the spaniard as a weapon of god now the lord may iustly bring him on vs the best way to preuent this and al god iudgements is for high and low and all estates to repent and so the lord will turne him away of thy workes namely fornication amp idolatry so we if we wil repent we must cease from our particular sins as the drunkard from his drunkennesse and to liue soberly ampc for to say i am sorie and in generall to repent as many man do is but to make shew of repentance but man must leaue each sinne and do the contrarie vertue in the three and twentieth verse is the third part of this threatening i will kill her child with death that is such as be of her familie and her children in fornication not them which follow her doctrine but properly for they are reproued before i will kill it had bene sufficient to say so but he addeth i will kill with death for the certaintie largenesse and fulnesse of it not sparing them but the mother sinned shall the child be punished for her sake ans in temporall and bodily punishments it may be so not in eternall punishments among man if the father be a traitor the son is punished and beareth the shame then shall it not be equitie with god to punish the son for the fathers sinne in bodily punishment and though there were no reason to vs yet we should thinke it good with god but there is reason sufficient why the lord should destroy cities and commonwealths and families which be linked together by the bond of societie and be members of the same familie now if one member sinne the other may be punished as in the bodie if the stomacke be sicke the head feeleth it so when the father sinneth the son may be punished when the husband the wife when the maister the servant when the subiect the magistrate because of the mutuall relation and nigh bond of societie betweene members of the same familie citie or kingdome is this so then parents had need to take heed how they sinne for they sinning may bring iudgments and death on their familie or their children then are they cruell parents which liue in sinne not caring for their children but by their sinnes bring god iudgements on them and on their families let then euery man in the societie where he liueth be carefull he sinne not for then he may bring god iudgement on the place especially if he be a speciall member as ahab on himselfe and his children and dauid on the whole people then all such as will not looke to themselues but liue in sinne should be banished out of all societies vnlesse they will repent and be new man seeing they do what they can to bring god iudgements on that place where they liue christ hauing propounded his threatning here he goeth about to make it take place in them in iesabell and her company by remouing of two carnall conceipts whereby they might thinke to illude and auoid christs threatnings for first they might haue said our practises and sinnes be secret not knowne to man therefore though god threaten we shall escape the iudgements of god but we are without the reach of them they cannot take hold of vs but christ in the first words cutteth off this first conception thogh you may perswade your selues you shall escape iudgement seeing your sinnes be secret yet i search the heart and i will discouer them to all churches they shall know that i search the heart that is i see and know the most hidden and secret thoughts and affections of the heart that all churches christ will discouer their sins not to all the world but to all churches and this he speaketh to the end to terrifie iesabel and her company for as it is a great honour to be approued and esteemed of all churches so it is a great disgrace and dishonor to be euill thought of by the churches of god mat that which is bound in earth by the church of god is bound in heauen by god himselfe so by proportion those which be euill thought of in god church and in disgrace of it they be in disgrace with god in heauen seeing christ speaketh this to terrifie iesabel and her company we must labour in all things to be approued and esteemed of the church though we must approue our selues as much as we can to all yet especially to the church of god and auoide all things which may bring any disgrace or dishonour to the church for as it is a great honor to be well esteemed of the church so it is a great dishonor to be il esteemed ro corinthian the last verse paule saith all the churches salute you not that all churches send commendations by word of mouth but to confirme and comfort them he saith all true churches planted by him did approue of them act paul approued of timothy and receiued him to him because he was commended and had the approbation of the churches and brother at lyconium and lystra so must we haue the approbation of god church which is the approbation of god himselfe but what would christ haue all churches to know namely that i search the heart ampc in which words by heart and reines is meant the same thing namely by reines is meant the thoughts and affections of man and by heart is meant so much as it is plaine in the old amp new testament but how can these signifie thoughts and affections seeing thoughts be in the braine affections in the heart neither of them in the reines ans by resemblance for as the reines be in the most secret and inward parts of the bodie so thoughts be in the most hidden part of man namely his soule so thoughts are said to be in the heart because they haue operation in the heart though they be placed in the brain search that is with such circumspection and diligence as bringeth the finding out of that we seek by this is signified that christ seeth not onely the outward actions but the inward affections and motions nothing the most secret is hidden from him we see by this christ is not onely man but very god for he which hath the true propertie of god is very god christ hath ergo he which is god alone can search the heart the thoughts motions and inclinations of the heart but christ can therefore he is true god one person consisting of two natures the godhead and manhood againe seeing christ discerneth the heart we must in all things take heed of hypocrisie especially in matters of religion when we seeme to be that outwardly which indeed we are not inwardly but we must looke that we be that in truth and in heart which we would seeme to the world to be amp draw nigh to god with our soul as we do with our body lips words and actions for christ is very god seeth and searcheth our hearts thoughts and affections he looketh not so much to the outward as the inward seruing of him we must worship him in spirit seeing he is a spirit besides we must suspect our selues for vnknowne sins for such is the depth of our corruption that we cannot sound the bottome of it neither can we thorougly see the pronenesse of our nature to sinne and corruption therefore we must suspect our selues euen of all sinnes which we know not and not excuse any sinnes so did dauid psalm after earnest search as though he had said lord i haue searched my heart but i cannot sufficiently know mine owne corruptions therefore o lord forgiue me all mine vnknowne sinnes and if we could thus suspect our selues we would better practise repentance and liue with greater care but ignorant persons not able to search their corrupt hearts they blesse themselues and excuse themselues nay say they can keepe the whole law now christ hauing cut off the first corrupt coceipt preuenteth the second wherby they might hinder and auoid his iudgement for they might say though the lord send iudgments yet we shall be safe they shall not come nigh vs thus they and euery sinfull man doth say isaiah they in common iudgement make a league with hell saying god iudgements shall not come nigh them this is a naturall corruption of our hearts that in common iudgement we shall escape and euery man liketh this now christ to cut off this corrupt conceipt saith and will giue as if he had said you may flat your selues thinke when i send iudgement you shall escape but i will giue to euery one none excepted according to his workes therefore flat your selues no more i will giue that is i will reward partly in this life and partly at the day of iudgement for it is meant especially of the last iudgement rom reu hence the papists gather that man must be saued not onely by faith but workes seeing god will reward good workes ans their reason standeth thus by that we are iudged by the very same thing we are saued but we are iudged by workes therfore saued by works the flat major is false for we must distinguish betweene iudgement and iustification to iudge is to declare one iust by his signes as his workes to iustifie is to make a man iust in which we consider nothing but christ and our faith applying him to vs so then we are iudged by workes but not iustified neither saued by workes answer christ saith not i will giue for their workes but i will giue them according to their works as their workes be not for them where he maketh workes an outward signe and rule according to which he wil frame his iudgement to declare man iust seeing euery man must be iudged that is saued or condemned by his workes then good workes are necessarie to saluation for we must be iudged by our workes and saued according to our workes therefore they be necessarie not as causes either efficient or helping any waies but as fruites effects and signes of our faith and markes in the way to heauen which must direct vs to eternall life seeing we shall be iudged in this life but especially in the last day by our workes we must labour to abound in good workes not to winne heauen by them but to assure our selues we belong to christ and shall be truly vnited to him now all good works are either the works or duties of the morall law of god or else they be those workes of our calling both generall as we be christians or particular in that calling god placeth vs done in faith and loue to god glorie the good of others and in obedience to god these be good works to god though the calling be neuer so base for which we shall be rewarded and according to which we shall be iudged and saued now contrarily evil works they be euident signes of condenation amp look how many evil works we do they be so many brands and markes of our soules to shew we be the children of satan here we see there are degrees of glorie in heauen and of punishment in hell for he will reward euery one according to his works then they which haue abounded in good workes they shall haue greater measure of glorie the fewer works the less glorie so they which haue committed greatest sinnes they shall haue greatest measure of punishment they which lesse lesse punishment in hell fire and vnto you i say in this foure and twentieth verse he cometh to the second part of his counsell to the church and angell of thyatira that is the better sort of the church but before the counsell he setteth a preface in which preface note first who speaketh secondly to whom for the first who speaketh namely i where christ as doctor of the church challengeth to himselfe all supremacie and sufficient authoritie ouer the church for all his ministers come in his name not in their owne the lord saith or christ saith but christ he comes in his owne name i say noting he is the head doctor and teacher of the church the fountaine and head of all doctrine deliuered to it this christ saith to smite a reuerence in their harts seeing this counsell is not deliuered to them by any man or angell but by christ himselfe who deliuered it to john for the second to whom he giueth counsell namely you that is generally after he expoundeth this you namely to the rest of the church of thyatira to the whole bodie and angell of that church except iesabel and her company where note christ speaking to them distinguisheth betweene persons namely the church and her angell and iesabel and her company so sutably he giueth his doctrine to them now he being the doctor of the church teacheth his ministers what to do namely to distinguish betweene man and man doctrine and doctrine not to deliuer euery part of the word to all man but to deuide it aright to giue to euery person that which may be fit for him but how must the word be deliuered to mixt congregations where there be both weake and strong papists and protestant despairing and impenitent auditors ans we must imitate christ we must distinguish betweene persons and sutably direct our doctrine to them impenitent and hard hearted sinners must haue threatnings with exception of the penitent hard hearted must haue no comfort but iudgement with limitation to them which despaire these coforts with limitation of them which be impenitent now what is meant by this rest of them christ sheweth and to as many as receiue not this learning where he giueth two notes to know these rest by the first they which had not this learning which maintained not the doctrine of iesabel and her company the second note they which haue not knowne the deepnesse of satan as they call it that is which haue not approued liked withstood nor giuen their consent to that depth of satan that is that doctrine of iesabel which they call and esteeme to be deepe and profound learning which these though they know it yet do not with knowledge approue it which iesabel and her company iudged profound learning beyond the doctrine of the prophets amp apostles of the first note i haue spoken before in the second note we may marke a wicked practise of iesabel and her followers they esteemed their owne learning highly profound but the doctrine of the prophets and apostles that was no such matter an high conceipt of her owne false doctrine but a base opinion of true apostolicall doctrine and this opinion hath bene in many heretikes so the iewes hold that god gaue moses two doctrines the first was the written law which was for the common people the second was a more secret doctrine which moses had by reuelation and so conueyed it to the iewes which they kept still in the cabbala so the papists thinke the written word but an inkie letter a dead letter or nose of waxe but the common consent in the heart of all chatholikes that they take to be the true word of god contemning the written word in the prophets amp apostles so the anabaptists they make the word of god written to be milke for euery nouice but the consent of the heart among themselues that is the strong meate nay this opinion is in our church for we preferre the writings of man before the word of god for if a man expound a text by the word gather doctrines according to the lawes of reason this we call simple preaching but if any bring in the authoritie of man as saint ambrose augustine with latine or greeke this we take to be a learned kind of preaching which is nothing else but to magnifie the writings of man to thinke highly of them but to disgrace the word of god thinke basely of it here christ saith i grant it is a profound learning not of god but of the diuell where we see christ alleaging this saying of iesabel doth it with a disgrace he saith it is deepnesse and profoundnesse but of the diuell yes christ saith not it is profound indeed but that it is iesabels speech as they say hence i gather that christian man cannot safely play stage playes and comedies of heathen and prophane man for these be full of prophane and blasphemous oathes and wicked sayings against god and the morall law now if christ alleaging but one word of a wicked woman did it not without disgrace of her how can christian man not onely speake but by iesture act heathen and prophane comedies as they speake he addeth these words first to shew that the words he alleaged before were not his owne but iesabels and her scholers secondly to shew the proud and presumptuous mind of them in that they call their owne hereticall opinions profound learning which is a note of a false teacher to vse swelling words and great bragges to make a faire shew iude verse pet but the doctrine of god is in humilitie both of spirit and maner of teaching the lord teacheth his will to the contrite and humble man psalm now followeth christs counsell though i lay no other burden on you yet i will haue you hold that still which i gaue you to the end this distinction cotaineth two parts though i lay no other ampc in the foure and twentieth verse yet i will ampc in the fiue and twentieth verse in the first part christ saith though i haue punished iesabel left her on a bed punished her children and familie yet i will lay no burthen on thee but onely that i reproue thee for the suffering of iesabel this christ speaketh to comfort them and all such as giue themselues to maintaine sinceritie of life and of doctrine for these shall be saued from common iudgements and haue the lord protection in commo afflictions though i punish iesabel and her company yet when wicked man be punished in common destruction you which study to maintaine sinceritie of doctrine and life shall haue god protection in common iudgements then it stands vs in hand to imitate the to labor to maintaine sinceritie in doctrine to defend truth in life and conuersation to make conscience of all sin if we labour to obey the lord in all things to keepe sincere hearts then in common iudgements though iesabel and her company yes all wicked persons be punished it shall not touch vs we shall find god mercie and protection our punishment shall be onely reproofe for some defectio in vs but if we maintaine falshood in doctrine liue loosely not making conscience of sin then god iudgements shall take hold of vs and afflict vs but that which you haue alreadie hold fast till i come after the preface followes the summe of the counsell of christ to the angell and church of thyatira which stands in a distinction though i will lay no burden on thee yet i wil haue you hold fast ampc the first part is in the verse the second part in these words as before i said that which you haue receiued that is that which my apostles and prophets haue taught you that doctrine of saluation they haue deliuered you hold that fast with both hands till i come to iudgement at the last day before christ commended this church for not approuing the false doctrine of iesabel but here he commands her to embrace the doctrine of the prophets and apostles hence we see christ would haue this church to embrace the doctrine taught by his apostles to maintaine that and not to regard any other but though an angell from heauen did preach any other doctrine he should be accursed galat by this we may iudge of the maine religions which be in the world namely of the turkes iewes and papists the papists magnifie their religion standing on vnwritten traditions but they cannot proue they be apostolic ergo we must not regard them no nor doctrines which man say they haue by reuelation for we must onely regard apostolicall doctrine as for the turkes religion it was not the apostles preaching but crept in six hundred yeares after them and for the iewes all their religio is against the gospel then good man in diverse country shold not be of diverse religions but they should embrace the doctrine taught by the prophets and apostles of christ neither should man because of dissent in religion be of no religion for christ inioynes this church to maintaine the doctrine of the apostles though many discented from it hold fast to the end here not how long not one or two dayes but to the end and we must looke to this seeing christ so straightly commands it because this is the foundation and mark of true religion and the readie way to saue mens soules to be constant to the end and for this tim paul bids him teach that he learned that others might instruct them which follow and so conuey it from age to age and for this the church is called the ground and pillar of truth and so the lord ephesians giueth the church pastors first such as by their teaching maintaine puritie in maners and teachers which maintaine it in doctrine then this is the churches dutie to continue puritie of religion to the end of the world if the marke be set wrong in the hauen it is enough to cast away all the ship so if the puritie of doctrine be corrupt which is the direction of our soules to heauen then we shall make shipwracke of our soules in hell then the ministers must not onely teach truly but labour to beate downe false doctrine which poisons the doctrine of the gospell and because man labour not to maintaine the puritie of religion and true doctrine the lord thess giueth them vp to beleeue lies and fantasies of man to him which ouercometh ampc in these words is the last part to wit the conclusion of the epistle containing two parts first a promise secondly a commaundement in the promise note two things first the parties to whom secondly the benefits promised the partie to whom to him which ouercometh whom here christ describes to be he which keepes his workes by his practise of obedience he which keepes or obserues this is the forme of obedience namely the obseruing of the works of christ which is not a keeping of them according to the rigour of the law but a constant purpose and indeuour to keepe them for the children of god haue this priuiledge that their will and indeuour is accepted of god for the deed in christ iesus there are many which haue litle knowledge these must not be cast downe but if they haue a desire and indeuour to liue according to the will of christ making conscience of sinne their obedience is true obedience and acceptable to christ my workes here is the matter of obedience namely christs works that is such workes as christ hath ordained in his word by his spirit and is the author of in his members christ cals these workes his workes therefore we must not thinke or speake or do our words or workes but onely christs workes commanded and ordained in his word and caused in vs by his spirit which we do when we conforme our works and wils to his word and will we see no worke is acceptable to god which is not ordered by christs word though we think highly of it esay he reproueth them for teaching the feare of god by mens comandemet this condemnes the turkes papists and iewes religion which are not workes of christ but of sinfull man standing in praying to saints fasting vowing masses ampc my workes not one or two workes but all my workes the creature must obey christ not in some but absolutely in all things he will not pattstakes but wil haue all or none dauid psalm conformed himselfe to the whole law so hezekiah he turned to all the law of moses vnto the end here we see christ will haue our obedience to be constant ampc we must not iudge of obedience by one or two actions but by the course of a mans life if his life hath bene good with conscience of sinne then his obedience is good for say a man by reason of sicknesse rage and raue at his death yet if he haue liued well and made conscience of sinne we must not iudge of him by that fit now the benefits promised are two first power to rule secondly the morning starre i will giue him power which i haue receiued of my father these words must be referred to the words not following but before for the better vnderstanding of them two questions are necessary first what is the power of the mediator secondly how farre he conueyeth power to his servant for the first the power of christ as he is mediator is great and described by three arguments first to rule ouer nation here is the largenesse of it for christ hath power ouer all man all country and kingdomes in the whole world are in his hand secondly it is soueraigne and absolute ruling and ouerruling all creatures ouerruled of none this soueraigntie stands in two things first that he giueth lawes that binde the conscience so that if man keepe them not he hath power to condemne them nay he ruleth mens wils and affections he can make them obey him in spite of their hearts seconly in that he hath this power of himself and from himself reu he hath the keyes of heauen and hel psalm he can breake them in peeces as a potters vessell thirdly he receiues it from his father as he is god he is equall to his father yet as he is mediator he receiueth it from him thus is his power generall soueraigne and absolute to come to the second question how farre this power is ours and imparted to vs answer the generall soueraigne power of christ is not giuen to vs or to any creature but to him who is god and man it is incommunicable to any creature and proper to the person of christ then christ speaketh these words not to shew that his absolute amp soueraigne power is giuen to vs but because his creatures haue the benefit of it the full comfort and saluation of the elect cometh from it they haue fruite of it in that they partake with him in his glory in heauen ephesian corinthian the saints shall iudge the world that is shall be witnesses and approuers of christs sentence not that they shall haue power to giue iudgement but they shall be caught vp first and he giuing sentence they sitting by him shall approue it secondly he giueth vs this power because he by this inables his in their owne person to ouercome sin the world and their owne corruption by this we see our dignitie euery servant of god hath power ouer nation ouer the world to rule and breake them in peeces to iudge and condemne them is this our priuiledge then we had need to take heed of all sinne for we cannot condemne other man of sin and be guiltie of sin our selues for it is a great disgrace for a iudge to condemne a malefactor of murther or theft and be guiltie himselfe so christ if we be full of sinne and make no coscience of it he wil neuer let vs sit to iudge the world with himselfe then seeing we are kings iudges and haue such priuiledges we must looke to our selues againe this is our comfort in persecution if thou be the child of god thou article a king a iudge though thou be now poore abused and persecuted yet the time cometh when thou shalt iudge and condemne thy persecutors and be auenged of them and rule the nation as a shepheard ruleth his sheepe that is to gouerne and feed them john feed my lambes that is feed and rule hence the papists gather peter was the generall bishop to guide and feed christs sheepe that is the world but then euery christian should be a pope for euery one hath power to rule the nation ouer the whole world but none will say euery one should haue so large authoritie then it is not meant of supremacie further from this place the papists gather that saints be patrons of country and kingdomes secondly that we may pray to saints in heauen for say they they haue rule of nation ergo they know them and what they do but they abuse the text for it is not said any christian shall rule ouer one nation but ouer all indefinitely neither do they rule as christ but as hauing benefit of his power again both their collectios are bad for by nation here is not meant any country or kingdome but the wicked onely they haue rule ouer not all nation simply but wicked man and vnbeleeuers and i will giue him the morning starre here is the second benefit promised by christ to him which ouercometh namely the morning starre with all the benefits which come thereby the morning starre is that starre which riseth before the sun some time of the yeare and by heathen man is called venus which in deed is christ himselfe reu now christ is called a star first because he illuminates mens wils and vnderstandings in things belonging to saluation secondly to shew that the prophesie of balaam number is now in the new testament fulfilled for now christ hath by his apostles reuealed himselfe plentifully to all nation againe he is called the morning starre for speciall resemblance for that starre riseth not at midnight or in the beginning of the night but in the morning in the beginning of the day and then shineth brighter then all the rest so christ the true morning starre came not in the beginning of the world or in the middest of it but in the latter age he came in the new testament and fulnesse of time and now he reuealeth his will more fully then euer in the old testament pet christ then is called this morning starre for in the old testament they had darknesse and candle light but now christ shineth out brightly i will giue him here is a promise of two benefits first perfect illumination and lightning whereby all ignorance shall be dispelled after this life and man shall then so farre know god as mans nature can comprehend the second benefit is the light of glory not onely of knowledge but perfect glory for by fellowship of this glory of christ we shal be made like saints and angels shining starres in the kingdome of heauen seeing christ is a starre we see how they be deceiued which liue in sin and ignorance without good conscience in pleasure and securitie and yet they thinke they belong to christ they haue the true light but such as liue in blindnesse neuer seeking to know god will amp obey him these are in darknesse haue no light in christ for what fellowship is there between light and darknesse we must follow peters rule first labour to haue this starre to shine in our hearts which is when we vse meanes to haue the beames of this sun to shine on vs to get knowledge in the mystery of our saluation by christ to haue this sun of righteousnes to lighten our minds and withall to warme and refresh our dead soules as the sun in the spring reuiues all things which seemed dead we must set open the doores of our hearts and entertaine this comfortable light seeing christ is the morning starre not that shines in the night but in the morning in the day time we must labor to leade our liues in godlinesse and sobrietie as children of the light rom and if we will not walk in this light it shall be taken from vs and we shall be cast into eternall darknesse let him which hath an eare here is the second part of the conclusion but of this often before this is the fift particular commandement to john that he should write an epistle to that great and famous citie of sardis the epistle hath three parts first a preface secondly body or substance thirdly a conclusion first the preface sheweth in whose name the epistle was written to giue it the more authoritie it containeth a liuely description of christ in his kingly office as he is the soueraigne head of his church and that in two royalties and priuiledges first in that he hath the seuen spirits secondly the seuen starres for the first i shewed what it meaneth chap verse namely the holy ghost who is the author of all grace so that to haue the seuen spirits is as much as to say he had the holy ghost ob all god servant haue the holy ghost therefore that is no peculiar priuiledge of christ ans true but not in the same maner for christ had it two wayes first in regard of his deitie secondly of his humanitie first as he is god he hath in him the beginning of the holy ghost for the holy ghost proceedeth from the father and the son therefore christ is said to send the holy ghost and to worke by him and whatsoeuer he doth in the church he doth it by him and for that cause christ is said to haue the seuen spirits secondly in regard of his manhood because the holy ghost hath powred foorth into his manhood the perfection of all graces and gifts whatsoeuer as he is annointed with the oyle of gladnesse aboue his fellowes and this perfection standeth in two things first in number secondly in degree or measure first in number thus among god servant some haue these graces some those none haue all but christ hath all the graces which all man and angels haue amp more too secondly in degree for the graces of christ are more in measure then all the graces of all the saints and servant of god whatsoeuer he hath the fountaine of all grace and therefore he is said to haue the spirit without measure and for that cause also christ is said to haue the seuen spirits this is spoken by occasion of the church and people of sardis which was a dead people and therefore christ was able to quicken them and to put life and spirit into them that no man can haue fellowship with the father or the holy ghost but by christ it is manifest by other places no man can come to the father but by me so there must be a participation with christ before there can be any with the holy ghost this serueth for our instruction because among the papists there be many great learned man which haue excellent gifts of nature wit memorie and vnderstanding and though they haue withall a reformed and ciuill life yet they want faith and regeneration how cometh this to passe that such worthy man hauing the common gifts of the spirit want the speciall the cause is this their christ is a false christ yes an idol christ they professe the want of sauing faith and all is because they want christ therefore no maruell though you see the greatest learned there mocke and scoffe at this speciall grace of the assurance of our election againe many among vs looke to be saued by christ and yet you shall see no grace neither of knowledge nor faith feare nor care to keepe god commandements or a good conscience no sparke of grace and yet looke to be saued by christ how can these stand together though they say they haue christ they deceiue themselues for they haue not the graces of the spirit and they haue no grace because they are not in christ and by that they may know they are not in christ because they haue no grace to conclude then we must all be admonished to labour that we may be vnited to christ our head truly to haue fellowship with him that in him we may haue fellowship with the father and the holy ghost no grace of god to life eternall will be bestowed vpon vs till we haue christ himselfe therefore first labour to be in christ and to be truly ioyned and vnited to him by the bond of faith that by this meanes we may haue all graces distilling and flowing into our hearts by christ now the second royaltieis he hath seue starres that is the ministers and pastors of the seuen churches christ is said here to haue them because he is the soueraigne lord ouer them he is an absolute lord ouer all for he setteth them apart and giueth them whatsoeuer gifts they haue he appointeth them their offices duties and callings so as he hath rule ouer them he appointeth ordaineth maketh and preserueth them as he hath in him the fulnesse of spirit so is he a lord ouer his ministers he hath power to saue if they obey or to destroy if they rebell ob the church maketh ministers ans the right of making ministers and ordaining them is christs royaltie and belongeth to him the church doth but testifie and declare who they be that christ maketh ministers and approueth them therefore he saith here the seuen starres be his now the end of these words is to strike the heart of the minister which is secure and negligent to make him know himselfe and his place that he may begin to haue sound conscience of his dutie and this point is an excellent motiue to make them looke to their dutie their gifts are not their owne nay they themselues are not their owne but christs and he is their lord this very consideration cannot but be effectuall to stirre vp all pastors to regard their duties for seeing they are christs they must not do their owne will we must renounce our selues in all things and therefore bethinke our selues our soules and our body are not our owne but christs let this consideration draw vs on to do thinke and speake nothing but that which christ would if he will haue you liue be content because he is the lord of your life if to dye be content because you are his and not your owne so much for the preface now followeth the second part of the epistle containing two parts first a reproofe secondly a promise the reproofe in the first verse i know thy works in which is contained a reproof and withall a remedie in the next words i know here note the vice and withall the reproofe the vice is hypocrisie for she pretended religion in outward shew but wanted it indeed thou hast a name that is the churches about thee iudge thee to liue that is to be borne anew beleeue in christ amp to haue his spirit to guide thee but thou article dead in sinnes and wantest newnesse of life and regeneration the like we may say of many great churches by name the roman church which though it seeme to liue yet in regard of spirituall life it is dead it pretendeth to be the true church of christ but in truth it is dead in sinne yet some say it is not dead but diseased full of sores and sicknesses and though the throat be cut yet it breatheth and panteth but the truth is it is starke dead and cold it hath no spirituall life at all but some alleage the contrarie saying it hath the sacraments in it and where there is a sacrament there is a church but they haue baptisme therefore a church ans baptisme is not alwaies a note of a true church for the samaritanes had circumcision which was before baptisme yet they were no people nor church of god os that there may be baptisme amp yet no church it appeareth because there may be baptisme without the preaching of the word as the papists haue baptisme without the true preaching of the word so they haue the outward baptisme but deny the inward baptisme which is iustification by christ and sanctification by his spirit againe i answer it is a sacrament not to that church of the papists but to the hidde church in popery for the lord euer hath his church among them he keepeth among them euen thousand which neuer worshipped their idols now then that sacrament is reserued in that church not for the papists but for god children among them by this we see god owne prouidence to call them by those meanes and for their sakes he reserueth the word and sacraments among them but they say antichrist sitteth in the middest of god temple but antichrist as we say is in the roman church therefore that is the temple of god ans the true church of god is among them but it is hidden now he sitteth in the midst of them not as a member but as an vsurper theefe and deceiuer for the church of god is in their church as wheate among chaffe and gold in drosse and the like may be said though not in regard of doctrine yet in regard of life of al our greatest townes in england for the body of them they seeme to liue if we looke on their outward seruice of god and shew yet indeed they be dead which appeareth by the common sinnes now in prosperitie as pride inward and outward fulnesse of bread carelesnesse in religion though we haue now the word plentifully preached yet we seeming to liue are stark dead yet the lord hath his church amongst vs but the body of our people though they haue the word preached yet they will not be reformed but as a father which cannot reforme his son by words must vse the rod so the lord when as the preaching of the word will not serue he must needs take the rod in his hand to make vs obey his will to reform our liues to trie which be his own childre amp which not christ before called these seuen churches his true church yet here we see this church hath corruptions in it so that a church may haue corruption in opinion and doctrine and yet if it erre not in fundamentall points it may be the true church of god and we must not condemne a church for corruptions in it thou hast a name other churches iudged of this church by the rule of charity seeing them to make shew of religion and to professe the gospell they iudged it to be a true church so must we so long as we see man liue outwardly in the feare of god professe religion iudge of the in charitie til we see some euident signe and commit secret iudgement to god we see all infants are not the children of god yet we admit all iudge wel of them in charitie coming of beleeuing parents and paul calleth all the churches he wrote vnto elect by the rule of charitie condemning none till god made them manifest but thou article dead the churches about iudged her to liue but christs iudgement is thou article dead then we must regard especially the iudgement of christ and not care so much to be approued of the church though that be good as to be approued of christ which cannot erre for though the church approue and commend vs if christ approoue vs not our estate is miserable verse be awake and strengthen the things ready to die after the reproofe followeth first the remedy secondly the reason in the remedy note two duties first to be watchfull secondly to confirme the graces of god decayed in them in that first he commaunds them to be watchfull we see it is an excellent dutie and then is a man watchfull when he hath great circumspection and heedinesse in respect of the saluation of his soule this dutie concerneth two things namely sin and death for we are commanded in the word to watch against these two against sin in two things first for a man to bethinke himselfe of all the sins he may fall into to do this he must consider first his nature secondly his calling first his nature that there is in it the seed of all sinne ergo he may fall into all sin secondly a man shall find that he is more inclined to one sinne then to another and against that he must labour most secondly for his calling we must know that euery calling hath his sinnes since the fall of man now a man must consider which be the especial sins of his calling and when a man seeth them he shall know by these two into what sins he may fall and against them he must watch another thing is to keepe the heart that it be not tainted with any sinne pro aboue all watch and ward keepe thy heart that is vse all good meanes to keepe thy heart cleane from all sinne the second part of watchfulnesse is in death against the coming of christ at iudgement vnto vs or in particular by death in which note two things first to bethinke our selues of christs coming to iudgement or to come to vs in particular and in this regard we must make account that euery day is the day wherein christ will come either in generall or particular iudgement the second dutie is to prepare our selues against christs comming to make vs ready to die euery houre as if christ would come euen this day so to morrow and euery day that we may do this we must vse sobrietie and temperancie in all the things of this life moderately to vse them not to be drowned with the pleasures amp profit of this life for we the forget the time of death and as christ prescribeth the remedie to sardis so to vs we are not better then they we take great care to prepare for the dangers of this life if a towne were in danger to be sacked or a house to be robbed we would set watch and ward to guard the how much more shold we watch for the saluation of our soules and not hazard them at death for want of watchfulnesse the second reason to moue vs to watch is the want of watchfulnesse and securitie which is the fore runner of destruction thes when man cry peace then cometh destruction luke when the rich man thought all was safe then came destruction and his soule was taken from him when the old world thought nothing then came the floud and swept them away this should admonish vs to take heed to prepare our selues and watch both against sinne and death vnlesse we will cast away our soules and strengthen here is the second dutie which is the reforming of the decayed graces as if he should say thou hast had many graces whereof diverse are lost and many are sore decayed therefore labour to recouer and strengthen them where christ teacheth vs that if we haue any gift of god we must labour to preserue it and not onely that but to increase and grow on and strengthen it we must not stand in one estate but increase in good workes that we may become perfect man in christ by growing in grace as in dayes for our gifts are not our owne but god we are his stewards he looketh to haue his owne with aduantage else we are vnprofitable servant then we must stirre vp the gifts of god in vs and to do so we must often and daily reade the scriptures daily heare them and meditate on the vse the sacraments often vse often prayer and inuocation and striue daily against our owne corruptions and withall stirre vp our hearts to good things and to true obedience psalm dauid saith i haue inclined my heart euen my dead heart and put life into it and so we must put life into our benummed soules and often call on them which are halfe dead but we commonly stand still seeke not to grow but stand at a stay christ by these words would signifie that some be dead other graces be readie to die whence we haue answer to that question whether grace may be vtterly lost we say some graces may othersome cannot be lost but sore decayed and diminished for god graces are of two sorts some necessarie to saluation as faith and regeneration some are lesse necessarie which go not with sauing faith as sensible and full feeling of god fauour ioy in the holy ghost earnest inuocation on god name now these may be separated from faith and be wholy lost in the servant of god for a time the other cannot though they may be sore diminished nay faith and regeneration considered in theselues may be lost wholy for nothing is vnchangeable in it owne nature but god the grace by which the elect angels stand is in it selfe chaungeable and these would perish and come to nothing vnlesse they were continually preserued kept and confirmed in vs and them if this be so why then do not the elect fall away ans not because they haue faith and regeneration or that they be in themselues vnchangeable but because of god promises as mat christ saith that the gates of hell though they shew their violence shall not preuaile against peters faith so that these graces are eternall not of theselues but by god promise which will preserue them to the end now seeing grace may be lost we must not be too confident if we haue any grace in vs but worke out our saluation with feare and trembling for they may come to that ebbe that they may be at the point of death now followeth the reason of the remedie for i haue not found ampc therefore watch and seeke to restore thy decayed graces i haue not found here christ signifieth that he made a search in this church and that to reward them either with life or death and so this was the practise of christ when he came to sodom he went downe to search it so gen the lord came downe to see babel the like is ierem and the lord he visiteth that is he enquireth of the sinnes of the fathers in the children and if he find them he punisheth them in the children and alwaies christ first maketh inquirie and after search made he rewardeth accordingly the like will christ do with vs therefore we must labour to be such as he may approue of if a magistrate were to search our houses we would see that nothing should be amisse how much more when christ the heauenly prince which searcheth the heart and cannot be deceiued cometh to search vs that he may approue of vs and reward vs but found thee not perfect there is a twofold perfection one of the law another of the gospell of the law when we satisfie the whole law of the gospell when our workes done proceed from a beleeuing heart which is carefull to please god in all things now though no worke of man be perfect yet those workes coming from a heart full of faith are perfect in christ god accepting the will and indeuour for the deed through christ christ he searched and found in this church many goodly works in shew only for they were full of hypocrisie made shew of godlinesse but wanted the power thereof neither did they come from an heart full of faith or that indeuoured to please god not to sinne in any thing therefore they were not perfect and pleasing to god in that this church is reproued not for want of workes and those faire in shew but because they proceeded not from a beleeuing and honest heart learne to pray as dauid psalm lord let my heart be vpright let me giue all diligence to please thee in al things this is a great comfort when one can say in his conscience my heart is vpright but hypocrisie is the killing of the soule before god christ seemeth to distinguish himselfe from god but he speaketh not of god simply but of the father and of himselfe as he is the mediator and so is inferiour to the father though he be now in glorie now seeing he is in heauen and in glorie there yet carieth himselfe as mediator we may pray to him without helpe of angell or saint and it is no presumption seeing he is still by his owne confession mediator and so carieth himselfe toward vs remember here after the remedie christ as a good pastour of the soule sheweth how to vse the same namely first remember secondly hold fast thirdly repent in practising of which three standeth the remedie of hypocrisie remember that is call to mind the doctrine of saluation taught by my apostles this remembrance is a most excellent dutie and bringeth with it many graces as subiection to god will repentance ampc psalm dauid seeing the prosperitie of the wicked had almost slipt and was sore tempted he could not be rid of his temptation till he went into the sanctuarie of god that is till he knew the word of god psalm he kept the commaundement of god because he remembred his name in the night season peter remembred christs words and so repented at the crowing of a cocke luke and indeed the cause of all sinne is forgetfulnesse of the word of god therefore heb euery sinne is called ignorance because we commit sinne not remembring and knowing god word and if we could keep in liuely memorie the word of god it were not possible that we should sin as we do then it is a most excellent meanes to cut off sinne to haue the word of god running in our minds forbidding sinne in vs and the diuell he laboureth aboue all things to make vs forget the word for then he can draw vs easily to sinne now that we may haue the word continually in memorie we must labour to haue our hearts affected with the same for we cannot remember more then we like and affect then we must beleeue it else we cannot remember for that we beleeue not slippeth soone out of our memorie and the cause why so few remember the word is because they be not affected and delighted with it nor beleeue it that thou hast heard and receiued that is that doctrine which by hearing and receiuing thou hast learned seeing he puts hearing and receiuing together we gather that this is the ordinary meanes of saluation to heare and receiue the word preached then god calleth not all man in all times seeing man in all ages haue not heard the word neither receiued it and if they haue not heard the doctrine of saluation by christ in all ages they could not be called for first they must heare and then be called in this last age only the word is sent to al natios it was not so in former ages againe false it is that god giueth grace generally to all man so that euery particular man hath grace offered to saluation if he wil receiue it but god gaue not the word to all for all haue not heard therefore they could not haue grace the second dutie is to hold fast this signifieth two things first to maintaine the doctrine taught by the apostles and receiued of them secondly to practise the same in their life but of these before the third dutie is to repent that is though she repented before yet she must restore and renew her repentancce hence we learne that we must not only begin but often renew our repentance and not onely for great sins but for litle slips and defects in grace as dulnesse of heart want of zeale coldnes in practise of religion ampc now because this church was ready to die christ addeth a reason to put life into her if she haue any grace if thou wilt not i will come on thee as a theefe a most terrible threatning if thou wilt not renew thy repentance restore that grace decayed in thee i will come as a theefe sodainly and with speedy destruction that thou shalt haue no time or way to escape it note here that this threatning is not absolute but with condition and it is the most terrible commination in the whole word of god where christ threatneth to powre out his whole wrath on a church so as they shall haue no time or meanes to escape it then we hauing the same sin that she had being dead in security by reason of our long prosperity we had need of this admonition to moue vs to watchfulnesse to restore god graces decayed in vs yet it seemes we make light account of all these things if a man had any sparke of grace this would stirre him vp but if this most fearefull commination will not moue vs then the end of all must needs follow euen the heauy wrath and iudgement of god must lay hold on vs and cast vs into eternall destruction where is no hope of helpe for then a man might haue some comfort if after a long time she should get out but he must liue there for euer without al end of pain when he hath bin there a thousand yeare his paine is still as great and as much nay no end he can haue then we must awake from our sins repent for our sins our securitie dulnesse and coldnes in religion stirre vp the graces of god in vs shake off our ignorance and that because against these sins christ giueth out this most terrible and fearefull commination verse notwithstanding thou hast a few names before christ had reproued this church of hypocrisie now he commends her for a few which professe his name among them but christ had said before that the church was dead how then can this be a true church ans though the body of the church were dead in sin yet a few some of them were true beleeuers and testified their faith in obedience out of this coherence we haue two instructions to learne first that a particular church and congregation is called a church in regard of the better sort and part and those which beleeue in christ and haue the priuiledges also in regard of the better part which beleeue for the catholicke church is a number of man on earth beleeuing in christ now the particular church is a member of the catholicke church so farre as they beleeue in christ those which beleeue not are no part of the true church but as bad humors in the body are no true parts of the body so these are no true parts of the church secondly we see a distinction betweene man and man in this church though all be called yet some called be dead some aliue in christ and continue so now the cause of this distinction is not from the will of man but from the good pleasure of god rom the whole body of the israelites fell to idolatry yet the lord had seuen thousand which bowed not the knee to baal what is the cause of this not the will of man but i haue reserued seuen thousand which haue not bowed to baal saith the lord so then his will and good pleasure is the cause why some stand and some fall so the cause why some in this church of sardis liued some were dead is because the lord in his good pleasure left some to themselues and to othersome he gaue his spirit this as before confutes vniuersall grace which derogates much from the grace of god for this why some stand some fall comes from and higher cause euen from the power and will of god which leaueth some to themselues and inableth some to stand by his spirit thou hast a few names here is the commendation of the better part of the church there be yet a few persons knowne to me by their names which haue not defiled their garments here he alludeth to the ceremoniall law for the lord in the ceremoniall law made a distinction betweene things cleane and vncleane not in themselues but by his appointment now among the iewes if a man with his hand or garment touched a thing vncleane he was defiled which ceremony signified to them that they should abstaine not onely from sin but all appearance of euill in that they might not touch any vncleane thing no not with their garments then here christ would shew there were sundry in sardis which did abstain both from sin and all occasions shews and appearances of sin though the body of the church were dead yet many in sardis made such conscience of sin that they auoided the very occasions of sinne hence we see that the servant of god be few in number the bodie of the church is dead in sin but a few be so far fro sin that they defile not their garments that is auoid all occasions of sin christ prepareth the kingdome of heauen for a litle flocke esay saith only the best part of the iewes must be saued the rest hardened and the way to hell is broade and easie and many runne that way the way to heauen is contrary mark then seeing the servant of god be few we must not follow the multitude but this sin carieth many a man to hell and to sin when man desire to do as the most do to liue as the most liue we must rather follow the litle flocke of christ and not runne after the multitude a few names that is persons knowne to christ by their particular names they be called names because christ writeth their names in a bill then we see christ knoweth his servant particularly by their names luke he knoweth all our haires much more our names john christ calleth his sheep by their names this is a speciall comfort for vs to know that our names particularly are knowne to christ and be written in his bil which is the king of heauen and earth the lord to comfort moses in trouble vsed this that he knoweth him by his name and so should it be to vs that our names are knowne to christ and he will accordingly help vs timoth there it is made the foundation of saluation that the lord knoweth who be his which haue not defiled these were commended for sinceritie and vprightnesse of life and conuersation though the rest of the church were dead yet these were aliue and kept themselues from all appearance of sin now christ commending them he leaueth in them a patterne of sinceritie for vs to follow to be as a looking glasse to see how we should professe religion we must not onely know and speake of the gospell but we must liue accordingly we must keep our garments fro pollutio liue without al occasion of sin and that we may liue sincerely we must first abstaine fro al sin in our own persons take heed we practise no sin secondly we must take heed of contagion of sin not partake in other mens sins by cosent or winking at them or giuing counsel to sin thirdly we must abstaine from all occasions of sinne from all appearance of euill we must not once name sin nor giue the least approbation thereof let not fornication be named among you ephesians then we must behold this patterne labor to be like them that christ may commend vs as he did them and this we must do by liuing well for religion stands not in knowledge but in practise and by doing these three that is abstaining from the practise of all sinne from the contagion of sin and from all prouocation to sin we shall imitate them and become a most excellent people and a worthy church of christ out of this place the papists gather that a man after baptisme may liue without al mortall sins for these few hauing put on christ liued free from all sinne nay from all appearance of sin but first though they liued so till this time yet how proue they they liued so after secondly they be said to keepe their garments vndefiled not because they sinned not at all but because they liued and endeuored in constant purpose not to sinne but in all things to please god and so the lord accepts their will and constant endeuour for the deed and they be righteous before god and no sinners but keepers of the law and these shall walke with me in white here after the commendation is a promise to walk that is liue in white that is in ioy and happinesse ecclesiastes let thy garments be white that is reioyce and take thy lawful pleasure in the things of this life the church before was threatned to haue christ as iudge and to destroy them but these few they shall not taste of his wrath but be with christ for euer in glory and happinesse by which we see that man which communicate not with the sins of townes country or nation shall not partake in iudgement with them lot liued in sodom yet his righteous soule was not partaker of their sins neither was it of their punishment gen ezech they which mourned for the sins of the people were marked and in the destruction not touched by reason of our long peace sins abound so that there is plentie of sin of contempt of the word of religion ampc these sins call for iudgment and wil haue iudgement now if we would escape this iudgement we must take heed we communicate not with these sins and then we shall escape though we liue in sodome after the promise followeth a reason of the same for they be worthy hence the papists gather that a man by his workes may merit heaue because here they be worthy of reward amp be worthy to walke with christ in glory but i answer all true servant of god be worthy of life euerlasting because god the father giueth christ to euery true beleeuer so that euery beleeuer may truly say christ is mine and withall he giueth the spirit of christ which stirreth vp in the heart true iustifying faith which layeth hold on christ applieth him and all his righteousnesse now christ being giuen to vs by god and receiued of vs by faith is wholly ours and his righteousnesse is made ours by imputation so that christ with all his benefits is truly ours and when one stands thus iustified in christ and clothed with his righteousnesse he is said to be worthy of saluation not for any thing of his owne but for christs righteousnesse for there is a double righteousnesse one of the person as when christs righteousnesse is imputed to vs another of the work as when a work is done answerable to the rigour of the law and then it is meritorious now christ speaketh here of the worthinesse of the person not of the worke of the person standing righteous in christs righteousnesse verse to him which ouercometh here is the conclusion in it note two parts first a promise secondly a commaundement of these before to him which ouercometh that is which getteth victory ouer all his spirituall enemy which we do by holding faith and a good conscience in all things to the end and this is first the partie to whom seeing that the promises are euer made to him which ouercometh we must labour to haue that estate in conscience truly to say we haue laboured in all things to keepe faith and a good conscience and to thinke it a miserable estate to be ouercome of any enemy be it sin the diuell the world or our flesh i come to the thing promised which is threefold in words but one in substance namely glory happines and life euerlasting first he shall be clothed in white aray that is with eternall glory happines and life out of this the papists gather that a man may do a good work in respect of reward it is true indeed one may do so as moses had respect to the recompence of reward hebr yet that must not be the principall end but faith to edifie the church and other man amp the we may do it to receiue eternal life as a reward and will not cut his name out of the booke of life here two questios must be assoiled what is the book of life whether one can be blotted out of it for thou hast the booke of life in god predestination or his decree in election by which he hath ordained some man to life in his good pleasure amp this decree of god is called in a resemblance the booke of life for as a general in the field hath his book wherein he writes al his souldiers names and a magistrate keepes a record writing in it all the citizens of that citie so god hath his decree wherein he writes the names of all those whom he will saue in his secret counsell the second question is whether one can be put out of this booke ans a man is written in this booke two wayes first in the iudgement of god truly secondly in the iudgement of man now if a man be truly written in the counsell of god then he cannot be put out but if he be onely in the iudgement of man he may be blotted out for the first they cannot because god counsell is vnchangeable and rom whom he predestinates he calleth iustifieth and sanctifieth this golden chaine cannot be broken but whom he predestinateth he glorifieth ergo they cannot fall finally as for the other being onely in the iudgement of man as all be liuing in the church professing christ these may be put out psalm let them be blotted out of the booke of life he prayeth that they might be manifested that they were neuer indeed in the booke of life hence first we see the number of the elect is certaine for their names are in god bill they cannot be put out but remaine for euer this then is no vniuersall election for what neede god a bill or booke to write in some if all were elected seeing some man being in this booke onely in the iudgement of man may be blotted out and manifested to man to be but hypocrites then we must take heed of all sin and make conscience of euery sinne for so often as we sin we reach vp a pen to heauen to crosse our names to blot them out as much as in vs lieth let vs then looke to haue our consciences assured that we be in that booke which we may if we find our consciences free from all sin and from all appearance of sin but some godlesse person will hence gather i will liue as i list for if i be in the booke of life i shall be saued if not damned liue how i can but these deceiue themselues for if their names be in it they cannot liue in sin but in faith and obedience in newnesse of life and repentance for he which is predestinated is iustified and must liue in repentance and faith and as surely as he shall be saued he shall liue in faith and repentance i will confesse him in the kingdom of heauen that is at the last day i wil take him for mine he which thus ouercometh and liueth in faith amp a good conscience i wil confesse him to belong to me to be my meber i wil separate him from al the world and take him to my selfe and pronounce to him the sentence of absolution come thou blessed of my father math the end why christ propounds this third blessing is to moue euery person in the church of sardis to confesse christ in this world for he reasons thus if thou shalt confesse me before man i wil confesse thee before my father if not i will deny thee euen before my father and so to vs if we will haue christ confesse vs before god we must confesse him before man and let no creature make vs deny him but stand out against all his enemy euen against the gates of hel and the diuel which is indeed a hard matter for flesh amp blood yet christ perswades vs to do it amp to take paines to professe him before all man for he will confesse vs before god if a king should come in company and choose out one and come to salute him familiarly call him by his name and take him by the hand that would be a great credit but what a happinesse is it to haue christ iesus king of all kings to come and call vs by our names take vs by the hands confesse vs to be his friends and pronounce the sentence of absolution before god his angels the diuel and all man euen our enemy verse and write vnto the church of philadelpha here beginneth the sixth particular epistle reaching to the fourteenth verse and as before euery particular epistle was set downe a particular commandement to write so here christ giueth john a particular commandement to write the end of which commadement is to warrant iohns calling as before often i haue shewed the epistle hath three parts first the preface secondly the matter thirdly the conclusion the preface is in the seuenth verse and it sheweth in whose name this epistle was written to wit in the name of christ and as in other epistles christ was described to get credit to the epistle so is he here by two properties first of holinesse secondly of truth besides he is desscribed by his kingly office which hath the keyes of dauid the propertie of christ is he is holy but how can christ be holy seeing he cometh of adam as he is man to this many answer that christ tooke his substance indeed from adam yet so sanctified as that it is free from all sinne this though it be true yet is not sufficient for as we take from adam the corruption of nature so we haue from him the guilt of sin now though sanctification taketh away corruption of nature yet it taketh not away the guilt of sinne then the true answer is this all which come of adam by naturall generation and that commaundement which god gaue in the creation increase and multiply they take from adam both corruption of nature aud guilt of sin for both be equally conueyed to vs from adam but god to preuent this ordained that christ should be borne not by naturall generation but by a miraculous conception and so though he take of man mans nature yet he taketh not mans sinne which he should as well haue had if he had come by ordinarie and naturall generation now in that it is said christ is holy note that he is so first in regard of himselfe secondly of vs amp his church in regard of himselfe first as he is god his godhead is holy nay his diuine nature is holinesse it selfe there is no difference betweene christ as he is god and his holinesse secondly in regard of his humane nature it was not onely free from all sin but filled with all holinesse aboue all man and angels he had the holy ghost without measure thirdly in his actions he was holy as in his actuall obedience and fulfilling the law secondly christ is holy in regard of his church euen of vs his members because he is the author of all holinesse in vs we haue all our holinesse from him nay he is the very roote of holinesse not as the father or the holy ghost but in a more speciall maner because from christ as the roote springeth holinesse in all his members and as from adam being the root in whom all mankind stood was conueyed sin and corruption to all which came of him so from christ being the roote is conueyed holinesse to all his members in him he is our sanctification because we fetch our righteousnesse from him as a branch doth sappe from the root for the humane nature of christ is the very root from whence is conueyed to vs all righteousnesse seeing christ is holy both in himselfe and in vs yes the root of all holinesse we must note this maine principle of all true religion which is to be set and ingraffed into christ as a branch into a tree and being once in him to become new creatures to labour to feele the power of christ killing in vs the old man our naturall corruptions and also renewing in vs the new man and the image of god in righteousnesse and true holinesse to feele the power and vertue of christ as sensibly in vs as we feele the corruption of nature and shew this vertue we receiue of christ euen as a branch sheweth the sappe it receiueth from the roote by the leaues and fruite seeing christ was thus holy he propoundeth to vs a patterne to follow teaching vs to be holy as he was holy to make conscience of al sinne to be conformable to him to marke what he did and to imitate it ioh we must purge our selues of sinne and be pure as he is pure for he which is not holy as he is holy shall haue no benefit or fellowship by his death and passion thirdly we see that title giuen to the bishop of rome is blasphemous to call him holinesse as it is common in all their speeches to him now he in that taketh to him the title of christ which is a part of christs honour communicable to none else nay he taketh more on him then christ here doth for christ is called but holy he is called holinesse it selfe the second title of christ is truth christ is called true in three respects first because without errour and ignorance he knoweth al things as they be in themselues so do not creatures but by vertue from him secondly because what he willeth and decreeth he willeth and decreeth seriously without fraud deceipt or any contradiction as appeareth in the whole scripture wherein is nothing contrarie to it selfe but all without chaunge and alteration thirdly because he maketh good all his promises in his word he accomplisheth and performeth them all he is the performance of the yes and amen seeing christ is true nay truth it self we see a difference betweene christ and all false spirits for they be spirits of errors the diuell is a lyer from the beginning he is the father of lyes nay his nature is to lie he can do nothing else but christ is true nay truth it selfe euery way true in his knowledge in his will and in his promises he is true seeing christ is absolutely true we must beleeue in him and beleeue his promises in his word without doubting for seeing christ is true nay truth it selfe what need we call his promises into question and this shold be the very prop of our faith that he which promiseth is true amp therfore wil perform his promise so in persecutio in trouble and affliction trust in christ he hath promised to helpe he will not faile because he is most true of his promise seeing he is so true he propoundeth himselfe to be followed of vs christ he knoweth things truly he willeth and decreeth things seriously so should we promise and performe and make good our lawful promises psalm the lord hateth the deceiptfull person reu without that is in hell be all deceiptfull and lying persons psalm it is a note of a member of the church and of christ to be true and faithfull and to speake truth from his heart for the diuell is the author of lies christ is described by his kingly office which hath the keyes of dauid first let vs see what is meant by the key of dauid esay speaking of eliakim saith i will put the key of dauid vpon his shoulder for ezra had bene hezechiahs steward an ancient steward in many kingdomes but in his dayes he began to be negligent in his dutie therfore he decreed to cast him out and to place eliakim in his stead king and therefore saith he will put the key of dauid that is the gouernement of the kingdome of iudah on his shoulder for by dauids house is meant the kingdome of dauid and the giuing of the key is the placing and inuesting him into his office and giuing him the authoritie of the kingdome of dauid christ here hath the key of dauid great and large authoritie of the churches as a chiefe gouernor in a kingdome it will be said dauids key was temporall christs kingdome spirituall ans first christ had dauids key properly for when christ was borne the scepter was departed from iudah to the romaine emperour so that christ then was the next to it and had true right to the crowne and kingdome luke and christ challenging his right saith mat that the kings sonnes be free and therefore he need not to pay tribute christ had dauids key typically and figuratiuely for dauids teporall kingdome was a figure of christs spirituall kingdome so dauid was a figure and type of christ therefore he is often called christ and ezec christ is called dauid now he is said to haue dauids kingdome and not neroes or any other because their kingdomes were kingdomes of darknesse and miserie and cursed kingdomes but dauids kingdome was a kingdome of light a blessed kingdome hauing those man which were acceptable to god and therefore was a type of the kingdome of christ then where christ is said to haue dauids key it is not so to be vnderstood that he had the same with dauid but that which is signified by dauids key christ mat is called a nazarite not that he vsed their rites and customes for he dranke wine they did not but because he was that signified by a nazarite namely by sampson iud for as he slue more by his death then by his life so christ he saued more by death then by his life yet christ was a nazarite that is seuered from all sin and pollution and so christ had dauids key that is the spirituall key signified by his temporall key which key signifieth authoritie power and gouernment of the church of god which openeth and none shutteth in these words christ hath relation to an house where when one openeth the doore he openeth the house and so christ he openeth and he shutteth which sheweth his absolute and soueraigne authoritie he hath the key of dauid and he hath it absolutely no creature is aboue him but he can shut or open at his pleasure now this key is the power of christ in his hand which is a supreme soueraignetie ouer the church by which he can saue or destroy now this soueraigne power of christ hath three parts first to prescribe secondly to iudge thirdly to saue and destory first to prescribe he hath an absolute power without constraint of any creature to commaund what he will haue done or not so he propoundeth doctrine to mens consciences to be beleeued vpon paine of eternall death christ sheweth in the bookes of the old and new testament that no man can make one article of our beleefe nay he which teacheth any other doctrine then that is accursed gal secondly christ hath absolute power to prescribe regiment to his church how and in what maner and also the persons by whom it shall be gouerned so moses made the tabernacle according to the patterne christ shewed him salomon built the temple according to the forme he saw by reuelation chronicle thirdly christ hath authority to prescribe times for his worship to appoint sabbaths ampc and gen as he created the sabbath so hath he power alone to alter it no creature can prescribe a time to god seruice to the end of the world but christ alone then it is not true that the church hath power to appoint two sabbaths in one weeke or one in many weekes for it is christs honour to prescribe his worship and the time of the same the second part of christs soueraigne power is to iudge to haue power to determine of his owne will without helpe of any man or angell and in this regard it belongeth to him to giue sense of the scriptures he alone gaue them he is the lawgiuer and must expound his owne law secondly christ alone must decide questions and controuersies concerning faith then the church hath not any such power but from christ by helpe of the written word by which christ expoundeth them to vs the third part of this soueraigntie is that christ can saue and destroy open and shut he alone hath the keys of heauen and hell he can open that is pardon sinne properly and he alone promiseth this pardon and can performe it being god and as he giueth the pardon for sinne so he giueth also eternall life sauing mens soules secondly he hath power to shut to cast some into hell and to destroy when man liue in sinnes and dye in the without repentance he hath power to hold man in sins after to cast them into hell and shut them vp for euer seeing christ prescribeth this doctrine to the soule and consciece to the most secret part of mans soule amp such doctrine as can saue and destroy we see christ he is lord of the church he is lord of the most secret wils and affections of the chiefest part of the mind the papists say that by vertue of this key of dauid christ can set vp and depose kings and princes at his pleasure but this they hold craftily to bring in the damned power of the pope but it will do them no good for christ as he is mediator of the church and gouernour thereof he deposeth none he maketh no king but as he is god so he maketh and pulleth downe at his pleasure being farre aboue all man and hence kings are called god because they represent christ as he is god christ as he is mediatour maketh man spirituall kings but he maketh not temporall kings but onely as he is god for if he had such power why did he refuse to deuide the inheritance saying who made me a iudge and to punish the adulterous woman confessing he was not a magistrate from this power is another deriued fro christ namely the power of the keyes which proceedeth from the power of christ and by which power the key of dauid is put in execution mat i will giue thee the keyes of heauen now this power of the keyes is a ministerie granted to the church of god to open and shut the kingdome of heauen first it is a ministerie that is a seruice and dutie for that which the ministers do is but a seruice done to the church and they be but servant and stewards of christ in the church of god in gouerning it so then it is no authoritie but a seruice when adam fell we all fell in him and he thrust himselfe and all mankind out of god kingdome by his sinne amp closed vp heauen gates against vs now since that fall christ became man and in his manhood dyed for our sinnes and made satisfaction to god for them and this satisfaction of christ is the thing which properly openeth the kingdome of heauen and nothing else properly christ alone can open and shut the church can only reueale and pronounce the will of god then no otherwise she openeth or shutteth but by declaring the same to be open or shut to the church of god that is to the company of true beleeuers called to saluation by christ to them onely is this key giuen mat the promise is made onely to the church and god people not to all societies of man the end of it is to open and shut how christ he knew best ioh where he sheweth what is the key and what to open and shut namely to pardon and remit sinnes and no way else can man open and shut now we must distinguish betweene giuing sentece amp pronouncing that sentence the first belongs to christ alone the second to man who forgiueth sinne not by giuing sentence but pronouncing sentence giuen alreadie by christ in heauen and to make the church to forgiue sinnes properly is to robbe christ of a speciall honor due to his godhead then the right vse of the power of the keyes is when the church of god vseth them onely in the name of christ to open and shut first as his servant and stewards secondly according to his will and word not mans traditions and affections thirdly to bring sinners to saluation to beget and continue them in repentance they being so vsed haue a promise namely what you bind on earth is bound in heauen ampc and it is the means by which christs power is put in execution now this power of the keyes giuen to the church hath two parts first the ministerie of the word secondly spirituall iurisdiction the first mat namely the ministerie of the word is set downe and authorised by christ i will giue thee the keyes of the kingdome of heauen that is the word of god and whose sinnes thou shalt bind by that word they shall be bound by the cords of their sinnes in heauen ampc this ministerie of the word is a key to open and shut two wayes first by teaching amp expounding the word of god and doctrine of saluation and this is a key luke you haue taken away the key of knowledge the key of knowledge is the doctrine of the word of god secondly the ministerie of the word is a key in man lawfully called in that they apply in the ministerie thereof the curses of the law to them which liue in sinnes and the promises of the gospell to the repentant heart so it openeth and shutteth the kingdome of heauen for that which the minister pronounceth by god word to be bound on earth is fast bound in heauen ampc here we must remember that ministers are either certaine or vncertaine of mens repentance being certaine they must remit sinnes certainely and simply but being vncertaine they must do it with condition and so they must simply or with condition remit and retaine sinnes then in the publike handling of the word man must pronounce with conditio seeing they be vncertaine who are penitent who not their auditors are a mixt company some beleeue and some do not beleeue lydiaes heart is opened simon magus is hardened the second power of the keyes is spirituall iurisdiction it is called spirituall to distinguish it from mens and ciuill iurisdiction of the magistrate it is set downe and confirmed by christ mat and after the promise is added verse this spirituall iurisdiction is a power wherby the church pronounceth sentence vpon an obstinate sinner and putteth the same sentence in execution it hath two parts excommunication and absolution excommunication is an action of the church in the name of christ excluding an obstinate offender fro the outward priuiledges of the church and the kingdome of heauen that so much is in true excommunication we see corinthian the incestuous person must be excluded from the church and be thrust out into the kingdome and regiment of satan and his body some way afflicted math if the offender will not repent being excommunicate he must be as a prophane man euen one which hath no title to the kingdome of heauen but some may say christ onely can thrust them out of the kingdome of heauen it is true indeed so he doth properly yet the church pronounceth who be receiued and who refused as that an obstinate sinner is shut out of the church and withall shut from the kingdome of heauen she can debarre him of the outward priuiledges of the church corinthian the drunkard which liueth in drunkennesse shall not come to heauen vpon which ground the church shuts him out by her sentence eue out of the kingdom of god amp christ ob if this be so the the true child of god may be shut out seeing he may fall to such sins ans he may in part and for a time not wholly and for euer because he may be ouertaken often but yet as a free citizen is known to be a free man though he be in prison for a time and so hath no vse of his freedome so the child of god though in part for a time he be shut out hauing no vse of the kingdome of heauen yet wholly and for euer he is not but so soone as he begins to repent he shal be receiued againe excommunication being so weightie a matter it must be vsed with great aduice and due preparation as we would when we cut off a leg or an arme not rashly for then we sin against the third commaundement seeing it is one of god speciall ordinances which we abuse whe it is executed for each smal offence this excomunication hath one especial degree as corinthian he which loueth not christ let him be anathema that is accursed and wholly shut from the kingdome of heauen and this is onely pronounced vpon one which sinneth against the holy ghost and then the church vpon sufficient ground may pronounce it but it is very hard to discerne this sin being more in the heart then any where else for it is a set malice against the person of christ and that vpon knowledge now contrary to excommunication is absolution when an offender vpon his sufficient repentance is approoued to be a member of the church and of christ first christ must receiue him then the church vpon his repentance pronounceth and declareth him to be receiued further to know the power of the keyes we must know foure abuses crept in the vse of the power of them the first abuse was in former ages in that they gaue them onely to peters person amp barred al other pastors from them wheras they belong to al pastors in their places as well as peter ob mat christ saith i will giue to thee peter ans but before he spake to all the disciples and peter he being more bold and indued with aptnes answered in steed of all not that the rest did not answer but to auoid confusion he spake for them all ergo christ speakes to him in stead of them al secondly john he giues it to them al not to peter alone and ministers haue that power conueyed from the apostles by vertue of christs promise mat he will be with them not onely in their persons but in them which followed to the end of the world to them i say which should preach and baptise as they did the second abuse is that the church of rome hath turned the power of the keyes into the supremacie of the church for they make it a supremacie ouer al princes and churches whereby they put vp and pul downe kings and make lawes to bind all mens consciences for it is a seruice and no supremacy the third abuse is that they will haue onely the clergie and not the prince to deale in matters of religion but we reade the contrary in god word iosias chronicle he intends to banish idolatry and to set vp the true worship of god and therefore causeth the people of beniamin and iudah to stand to his couenant his subiects to obey his intent and this is commended in him but they say that princes haue not the chiefest power to gouerne because pastors haue the power of the keyes answer spirituall power is giuen to the pastors to rule the church spiritually yet princes haue power to rule the church ciuilly to cause their subiects to embrace true religion and to forsake idolatry but then say some they should be vnder the pastors answer if we consider the pastors person and goods they be vnder the princes but as they beare the key of christ and his word the king must honour them for they stand in the stead of christ but to make the pastor aboue the prince is a ready way to get all into his hand and a great abuse in the church of god the fourth abuse is that the roman church hath turned the power of the keys into the hands of their priests in the sacramet of penance for euery popish priest sits as iudge and euery man cometh to him kneeleth to him confesseth all his sinnes he can remember against euery commandement he inioyneth him to bewaile them and after some signes of repentance he forgiueth the fault and that properly as god doth yet after pardon he must vndergo some temporall punishment for he forgiueth the fault only not the punishment in which abuse note these errors first there is confession of all sinnes which hath no warrant in the word secondly he giuing absolution properly as god doth robbeth christ of his honor for eue the pharises confessed that god alone forgiueth sinnes properly thirdly they absolue from the fault but not the punishment and this is to enrich themselues and to get whole country yes all mens lands and liuings into their owne hands fourthly they will haue them make satisfaction to god which is impossible and withall maketh christs satisfaction imperfect now by these foure abuses it appeareth that christ vnto the is no true christ but though the pope giue the keyes of peter the crosse keyes in his armes yet he hath not the true vse of them nay seeing he maketh new doores as beside that of heauen and hel those of purgatorie and lymbus patrum he must make new keyes to open them flat contrarie to the keyes of christ in that christ is said both to open and shut we learne that he openeth not to all man and euery person but shutteth heauen gates against some for adam falling from god fauour by his sinne shut out himselfe and his posteritie both out of the heauenly and earthly paradise so that our sinnes be now as a partition wall and a cloud to separate god and vs and for this euen for our sinnes christ shutteth some out of heauen then by this we see our miserable case for by our sinnes we be all shut out of heauen and vnder the power of satan our sinnes haue bene as so many bars to shut vp heauen gates which is no small matter yet the diuell bewitcheth vs and maketh vs thinke sinne is no sinne great sinnes be small small none whereas the least sinne is sufficient to shut vs out of heauen for euer againe seeing sinne shutteth vs out of heauen we must repent for euery sinne for we cannot come thither if we liue in any one sinne euery sinne is a barre and locke to shut vs from god kingdome and we must labour to haue these bolts taken of which is only by the passion of christ for that alone can take them away thirdly we see that christ opened heauen to some as to nathanael in the ministery of the word and he hath now opened heauen doores by his death and traced the way by his blood now the doore being open we must labour to enter in yes thrust and croud to get in that we may come thither we must become members first of his church on earth else we cannot come to heauen that we may do this first we must come to the doore namely the church before we come to the house namely heauen now the church is the doore and in it is the key to open heauen gates namely the word of god that thou maist come into the church first humble thy selfe for all thy sinnes secondly trust in christ for the free pardon of all thy sins and purpose in thy heart to liue a new life and constantly in all things to please god to the end and then thou article in the church and hast the key to open heauen gates but if thou come not to open this doore in this life where the key is thou canst neuer enter into the kingdome of heauen in the life to come verse i know thy workes from this eighth verse to the eleuenth is contained the matter of the epistle containing three heads first praise secondly promise thirdly commandement the praise is in the eigth verse the promise is two fold in the ninth and tenth verses the commaundement in the eleuenth the praise is propounded summarily i know thy workes then the reason why he praiseth her where the former words be expounded i know thy workes this hath bin expounded in euery epistle i know and approue thy course and conuersation of life these words are repeated in euery epistle to stir vp euery church and member of the same to the feare of god for christ by these words would haue vs be perswaded that god is present with vs seeth all we do is an eye witnesse of all our actions then we should do all our actions as in his presence as before his maiestie and where this consideration is not in some measure there is no feare of god nor true religion the reason of this commendatio is added behold ampc here note two points first a signe of his approbation i haue giuen thee an open doore ampc secondly what be the workes he approoued thou hast a litle strength behold ampc these words may be vnderstood either of the angell of philadelpha alone or of the whole church both pastor and people if of the angell this is the sense behold i haue giuen thee that is behold and consider i haue giuen and vouchsafed thee libertie and oportunity to preach my gospel and by preaching to win and conuert sinners to me so corinthian there paul vseth the same words signifying by the doore of vtterance libertie and oportunitie to preach the gospell of christ for thou hast a litle strength that is though thou be endued but with a small measure of gifts yet thou hast maintained the doctrine of saluation and not denied my gospel in persecution now christ saying thus to this minister that he had giuen him libertie to preach shewes it is a great priuiledge to preach the gospell and to win soules to christ for so much the word behold and the words themselues import that it is so it appeareth in that the most worthy prophets haue not had this graunted as esay ezechiel ampc they hardened the people and they say they spet their strength in vain amp did no good for this ministers are called the instruments of saluation daniel they shall shine for the winning of soules as stars in heauen then they which haue this priuiledge should esteeme of it highly aboue any thing in the world for it is a most excellent dignitie aboue all earthly preferments for which we ought especially to magnifie god mercie for thou hast a litle strength though thou hast but small measure of grace and gifts yet thou hast maintained my word here we see that ministers though indued with small gifts may do much good to the church as this angell of philadelphia did and we haue seene by experience when as in queene maries time in this place learning abounded yet not one of them would stand out for the gospell yet one not farre off hauing but small gifts in comparison of their schoole learning stood out and sealed the profession of it with his bloud and so now man of smaller gifts further the church and gospell more then they which haue farre greater knowledge in the arts and tongs for such as haue greater gifts be commonly flacke so that they which be behind them in gifts an hundred degrees do more good in the church then they by a thousand degrees yet for all this man must be brought vp in learning and labor to know arts and toungs though we see it cometh to passe that man which want such schoole learning they haue zeale and do more good then they which excell in them that so man of greater gifts might be humbled in the consideration of this point naamans servant perswadeth him when elisha the prophet cannot king behold these words may also be vnderstood of the whole church i haue giuen thee a doore that is a speciall priuiledge to enter into the kingdome of heauen and title to it i approue thy workes and this is a signe of it that i haue giuen thee entrance into the same now this is a priuiledge not belonging to all man but onely to the church of god which confuteth vniuersall redemption if this then be a priuiledge of the church to enter into the kingdome of heauen and to haue such liberty we must labour to vse it striuing to enter into that place we haue this priuiledge to see heauen open by faith we must not then be so slacke to enter into it but alas we make no account of it we are wholy possessed with the profit and pleasures of this life and our sinnes are such a loade to vs that we cannot enter in oh let vs cast off such burthens that so we may more easily enter which no ma shall shut that is no power after i haue opened heauen shall be able to shut it here after the libertie he sheweth the continuance of it namely for euer how then is it true that christ died for all man effectually if all man are not saued because they will not so christ should for his part open heauen and they should shut it by their wils but christ saith no power either of the diuell or man can shut it he hauing once opened the same for thou hast a litle strength thou article indued with a litle and small measure of grace of faith hope amp regeneration yet according to that measure thou hast defended my word and not denied me in persecution by this we see that a man indued with a small measure of god spirit may do works acceptable to god and by the same come to life euerlasting if his grace be true grace math if their faith be but as a graine of mustard seed it shall be able to remoue mountaines now that which is true of miraculous faith that is true of iustifying faith if it be true though neuer so litle yet it shall be able to do workes pleasing to god and by the same we may come to saluation for god regardeth not so much the measure of grace as the maner that it be true not fained in this is a speciall comfort for those which labour to keepe faith and a good conscience such are often troubled with the consideration of their owne weaknesse and wants but they must know that if they haue true faith though it be but in small measure the lord accepteth of them if they labour to please god in all things for the lord accepteth a man not for that he should haue but for that he bestoweth on him be it much or litle this may incourage those which be not so forward in religion which haue not made such proceeding as they should for many seeing the lord to require so much they cast all off and neuer labour to come to know religion and to keepe faith and a good conscience but these shold remember that the lord accepteth of small gifts if they be true he accepteth a man according to the measure of grace he bestoweth on him be it more or lesse then we must not be discouraged for our wants imperfections and ignorances for if we labour to haue true faith the lord regardeth not the measure of grace but that it be true grace yet we must take heed we abuse not this mercie of god and take occasion to sinne and to become negligent and carelesse in the duties of religion but still labour to come to such measure as the lord will most approue of because ampc here christ sheweth for what workes he commendeth this church first she kept his word secondly she denyed not his name but maintained it in persecution against all his enemy and these two containe euen all the duties of a true christian and the whole practise of all religion and these must be an example for vs we must labour to keepe his word and in all things to do his will secondly we must in time of persecution defend his name and maintaine his word against all his enemy to keepe his word a few wordes but a great dutie for it signifieth that she in all things in euery commaundement of the law and gospell had care to obey his word and will and happie were we indeed if christ could say so of vs that we obeyed his word all the commandements of the law by obeying and the gospel by faith and repentance ampc but it cannot for though in shew we professe we do yet in life we shew we faile in most points of both verse in these verses are two promises concerning the conuersion of certaine iewes behold ampc here is the first promise concerning the the confirmation of the church of philadelphia now it is likely in this citie there was a synagogue of the iewes which bare man in hand that they were the true worshippers of god yet denied christ the sauiour and so persecuted this church now christ here promiseth he will make this synagogue repent and become true members of christ to professe christ and worship him in this promise note three points first who is the author of their conuersion namely god for so it is said i will make them or i will bring them to that estate to worship me secondly who be conuerted namely the synagogue of the iewes thirdly the fruites of their repentance they shall worship before thy feet first the author of their conuersion is christ himselfe for so he saith i will make them to repent these are significant words which giue all to god in their conuersion of some and of all sinners god is the sole author man hath no stroke in his owne conuersion man indeed willeth it and is conuerted willingly yet not by nature doth he will it but by grace this confutes the papists who hold that nature and grace may concurre in the conuersion of a sinner for a man say they being stirred vp by grace can will and do that which is good as a man being sicke he hath the facultie of walking yet being faint he cannot vnlesse he leane on anothers shoulder so a man hath a power to will that which is good but it must be stirred vp first by grace but ephesian man by nature is not onely sicke but starke dead in sin and cannot moue one foote no more then a dead man obiect but say they then man should be but a blocke if he doth nothing in his conuersion answer though he do nothing in the matter of conuersion yet he hath sense and vnderstanding which he can vse in naturall and ciuill causes though he cannot vse them in spirituall actions and so he is not like a stocke i wil giue the and make the come therfore a man being effectually called he cannot either come or not come at his pleasure as though god did for his part offer man grace and will him to come yet he may refuse it and not come but if god call man cannot but come else christ would not haue said i will giue him and make him come but they say matth christ saith to ierusalem how oft would i ampc but you would not answer he spake that not as he was god but as he was a prophet or the minister of circumcision to the iewes againe say they act they resisted the holy ghost ans that is the doctrine of the apostles and prophets which was indicted by the holy ghost not the spirit of god himselfe for no inferior power can resist a superior to come to the next who be conuerted namely a certaine synagogue of the iewes at philadelphia which said they were worshippers of christ yet indeed were the synagogue of satan and bond slaues of the diuell here we see not onely small but great and old sinners may repent and be saued christ he died for all kinds of sinners great rebellious and obstinate if they can repent they may be conuerted and come to christ thess they must waite for the repentance of those which were taken in the diuels snares so as he would wish them no surer rom some were giuen ouer to a reprobate sense yet it is likely that some of them repented then we see great grieuous and notorious sins may be forgiuen yet we must not abuse the grace of god to liue in sinne but gather comfort hence that though we be great sinners yet if we can repent there is mercie with the lord no sin can hinder vs from christ we reade that christ healed three sorts of dead man some when they went to the graue some buried and some which lay foure dayes and stanke as lazarus did so christ healeth all kind of persons he calleth man of all sorts euen them which lie stinking in sinnes and are almost rotten in them then take the benefite of christs exceeding mercie when he calleth thee to repent come and cast away thy sinne though thou be a vassal of satan a man rotten in sin yet christ hath mercy infinit he can heale and help thee and he came to call not those which think they be righteous but such as are penitent sinners to take them out of the lions paw and to saue the lost sheepe of israel then abuse not this exceeding mercie but blesse his maiestie for it and vse it as a meanes to repent to bring thee to newnesse of life to breake off thy sin and to make thee a liuely member in iesus christ i will make them come and worship now followeth the third point in the conuersion of a sinner namely the good fruites of their repentance and conuersion i will make them worship these words are expounded corinthian where the children of god prophecying there cometh in an vnlearned man he falleth downe and worshippeth so here he will cause these wicked iewes to come and fall downe and worship and adore the true god in the congregation of god church and people in these words note two fruites of conuersion the first concernes god the second the church of god and the members of the same for the first to worship god it is a true fruite of a conuerted sinner which no man can truly performe as he ought till he be conuerted to wit to worship and adore god in the company of his saints amp people the natural man knoweth that there is a god that this god must be worshipped but to worship him as he ought it is a worke that none but he which is truly conuerted can performe another may performe outward worship heare the word receiue the sacraments but true worship which is in the heart and spirit for god is a spirit that he cannot performe now for the worship of god three properties are to be noted in these words first they shall come and worship not worship simply but come signifying that the true worship of god must be voluntary willing and cheerefull not of constraint or compulsion but as though there were no law or iudgment for them if they did not psalm they came freely not by compulsion then we see how most man come short for man are not touched with loue of the word neuer or seldome come to heare it onely come to morning or euening prayer because if they do not the law wil compell them these are no true worshippers of god for he cannot abide any worshippers but willing and voluntary and worship that is reuerence god with bowing the body or knee and this is the second property we must expresse our reuerence in conuenient and seemely bowing of the body or the knee then we see this is not a thing indifferent but necessary to vse meete and conuenient gesture of the bodie in the seruice of god to bow downe and prostrate our selues our soule and bodie esay the angels in the presence of god couer their feete with three wings and their face with other three testifying their reuerence and adoration in the worship of god so must god people worship him in soule and bodie ampc but we come short in this dutie for whereas we should vse seemely and conuenient gesture of the bodie to shew our reuerence and humilitie we see many lie snorting and leaning on their elbowes others vnreuerently with their heads couered which ought to be bare for god is a god of soule and bodie therefore we must reuerence him with both before thy feet this is the third propertie namely in the congregation of god people they shall prostrate themselues at their feet in hearing the word or prayer they must be humbled the pride of their hearts beaten downe be smitten with feare of god maiestie and of their owne sinnes act the iaylor ouer night put paule into prison but in the morning finding all the prison doores open and thinking all the prisoners to be gone he would haue killed himself now being thus astonished and affraid paule preacheth the gospell to him which before he contemned but now being smitten with feare of the maiestie of god he heareth paule willingly with trembling and cometh kneeling and crowching to him saying what shall i do ampc and vntill a man be smitten downe with feare of god glorious maiestie with sense of his iudgements for his sinnes and so come to humble himselfe he cannot be a true beleeuer of god will and word the cause why there be so few true professors and that all serue god with formall worship is because they were neuer cast downe they were neuer smitten with feare of god maiestie neuer confounded for their owne sinnes for till these be in vs in some sort we cannot worship god we cannot bow and crowch and humble our selues before him and this is the cause why most of the people euery where content themselues with outward and formal worship with mumbling ouer their creed pater noster and the tenne commandements they were neuer smitten downe with feare of god iudgements and their owne sinnes their natural pride was neuer beaten downe with their owne vnworthinesse then if we would be true worshippers of god let vs come willingly let vs worship god in soule and bodie and let vs come with humbled hearts with mortified minds and affections and so we shall worship him aright the second fruite of the conuersion concerneth man before thy feete meaning the church of philadelphia namely that they being conuerted to the church of god should reuerence it and the members thereof they shall cast themselues downe in the congregation as man not worthie to be mebers of the church but as a footstoole for them to trample and tread on by reason of the great sinnes which these conuerted iewes had before committed this their exceeding reuerence shewes it selfe in the roote of the same which is a base conceit and vile opinion of themselues and so should euery true conuert study to confesse namely that he is the greatest sinner of all god children and thinke so basely of himselfe that he can be content to be not a member but the footstoole of the congregation and this must we follow if we be truly couerted we must haue a base opinio of our selues think we are the most vile of all god people amp giue place to all man in regard of our sins paul tim calleth himselfe the chiefe of all sinners and we must do the like for the proud pharisaicall heart is farre from repentance but the lowly and humble heart is accepted of god and shalt know that i loue thee here is a reason of the former words for why did these persecuted iewes become true worshippers of god and beleeue in him and reuerence his church the reason is because i wil make them perswaded that i loue them and this is the ground of all true reuerence all superiours haue reuerence due to them by god ordinance as the father master magistrate ampc now that they may haue true reuerence of their inferiours they must first labour to be beloued of the lord and then they procure to themselues true reuerence for the loue of god to vs is the ground of this then those which excel in birth or riches they must not looke to be reuerenced for them but for that they be loued of god and whence cometh it that man in authoritie as the father master magistrate prince ampc want their due honor and reuerence but because they seeke not the ground of it namely to be in the fauour of god because thou hast kept the words of my patience here is the second promise of christ namely preseruation of this church in time of most bloudie persecution this epistle and booke was written by john after christs ascension in the daies of diocletian now after him came traian who raysed a most bloudy persecution against the church in al country putting to death many of god children now of this persecution christ foretels this church and withall makes this promise that he will preserue them out of the emperors hand and addeth a reason they were constant to obey his gospell in the promise consider first the occasion because thou hast kept secondly the thing promised deliuerance thirdly a prediction or prophecie of that which should come on this church the occasion because thou hast kept the word of my patience some vnderstand by word of patience the comandement of patience which she shold obey but that is too narrow but it signifieth the doctrine of saluatio taught in christ and this doctrine of saluation is called the word of patience first because the doctrine of the gospell teacheth vs patience secondly because it is an instrument of patience to worke it in vs for when a man beleeueth his saluation in christ then he is patient in all things thirdly and especially because the gospell cannot be obeyed constantly to the end without patience for a time one may obey but it is impossible to obey and be constant to the end without patience the good ground bringeth foorth fruit but in patience luke this church receiued the doctrine of the gospell and constantly beleeued it for which is promised deliuerance in persecution then we see that the grace of god well vsed is rewarded with plentie and increase of grace so that they which haue but small measure of grace yet if they be faithfull the lord will reward it with greater increase this should make vs take pains to increase and vse our talent of faith patience repentance and obedience to the glorie of god and good of man and the lord will double and triple the same otherwise he will take that talent from vs the doctrine of the gospell being a doctrine of patience how necessarie is it for vs to learne the same seeing the calamities and afflictions belonging to any calling are very many we must get our bread in the sweat of our browes and no man is free from sicknesse sorrow and death now if we would indure these afflictions we must haue this grace of patience and constantly beleeue the doctrine of saluation by christ which will make vs patient in any crosse whatsoeuer againe we professe the gospell of christ now this is a doctrine not of disorder but of all order and moderation teaching vs to moderate and hold in our affections and will whereas if we want it we are caried away at their pleasure my patience christ calleth it his because he is the author of it and worketh it in vs and this is added to beate downe the pride of this church for when christ commended them for obedience they might begin to be too proud therefore he hauing commended her lest she shold be so he telleth her it is not her owne but his gift he putteth it into her heart and this may beate downe the pride of our hearts when we consider that we haue nothing of our selues but all good things in vs come from christ he bestoweth them on vs he giueth all nothing we haue of our selues what hast thou that thou hast not receiued why then should we be proud of it i will deliuer thee that is from the great and bloudie persecution of traian which lasted fourteene yeares wherein many of god children were put to death hence note that god hath set downe the very times and houres in which he will trie the faith of his children deut the lord led israel through the wildernesse fortie yeares to trie them chap he sendeth false prophets to trie his servant whether they will cleaue to him or not so the lord hath set times to trie his for their sins and to see what grace is in their hearts so he dealt with abraham commanding him to kill his son gen chronicle he left hezechiah to trie him and so euery christian hath his set time when he must be tried that so god may either discouer his hypocrisie or make knowne his faith when one foundeth a schoole he setteth some to see how they profit after seuen yeares or some such space he will looke to trie the scholers that he may see how they go on and without this triall man will not make so good progresse so in god schoole the lord he cometh at his set time to trie what profit man haue made to trie their hearts or true obedience to reward them accordingly if god will thus trie vs then it is best to trie our selues to seeke what is in vs for though thou maist bleare the eyes of the world yet thou canst not deceiue him he will search thee and lay all open to the world if thou be an hypocrite he will detect thee and make thee knowne if not he will make knowne thy grace then neuer dawbe vp the matter spare not thy selfe but seriously enter into thine owne heart and neuer run with adam from god for he will pull thee out slippe off thy figge leaues and make thee manifest to all man now when we haue entred into a narrow search we must in a strait maner seeke to reforme our liues to the rule of god word that so the lord when he cometh to trie vs may approue of vs for it is said he will come the time is set and cannot be changed it is a wonder to see how mens mouths be full of precisenesse so that if man knew not the world to be full of blindnesse it might daunt many christian hearts but seeing there must be a day of triall of all that is in vs the lord will not take our hypocrisie but he looketh for sinceritie then we must seeke as much as is possible to conforme our selues to god will for when we haue done all we can we come farre short and though man mocke vs yet god will approue vs then labour to be pure in all things without hypocrisie not giuen to any one sin but in all things word deed and thought keepe faith and a good conscience be not like to the foolish virgin haue not blazing lampes without oyle if a man come to trie a scholer in a good schoole and after long teaching find him not to haue profited it is a great disgrace the what disgrace is it for vs if after so long time of grace christ come to try vs and find no grace in vs no faith repentance nor obedience but hypocrisie and nothing answerable to our profession but we must with dauid psalm be so vpright that for sinceritie of heart we would be content to haue the lord to trie vs being not giuen to any sinne nor tainted with any offence i will saue them but how can this be seeing no church was free fro this generall persecution of traian for the churches of asia were all persecuted now this was one of the most famous churches how then did christ saue them seeing they were persecuted grieuously and it may be put to death many of them ans promises of deliuerance as this is be not simply made but with condition i will deliuer thee that is saue thee from temptation and persecution so farre as it shall be hurtfull for the saluation of thee christ promiseth freedome not simply from persecution but from the hurt which might come thereby to the in respect of god grace and their saluation ps he which trusteth in the lord the plague shall not come nigh his dwelling yet we see in common plagues as well the godly as the wicked die yet it is a true promise that the plague shall not come nigh him to hurt him or his to hinder any mans saluation and we pray lead vs not into temptation not to be free from all teptations but that we be not wholy left of god vnto the diuel but though we be tempted that he will deliuer vs from the euill of the temptation that it may be for our profit and not our hurt and so christs promise is good to them god will haue his children tempted yet here is their comfort he will keepe them that they shall not haue any hurt by the temptation to hinder his grace or their saluation though they be subiect to temptations and suffer a thousand crosses yes die in them yet if they keepe the faith they shall take no hurt but the lord will turne them to their good so that this may comfort and reuiue any perplexed and oppressed conscience in persecution and temptation againe seeing this promise is onely conditionall and not simple but as it freeth vs from the hurt of the temptation we see they which pray for freedome from all temptations afflictions and persecutions haue no warrant out of god word if they put not in that caueat for euery petition must haue a promise in the word now there is no promise that a man shall be free from all temptations but onely from the hurt of temptations amp afflictions then we must when we pray for temporal deliuerances pray onely with condition so farre as they shall not hurt our saluation and hinder god grace in vs from the houre of temptation but how can this also be true that the long and bloudie persecution vnder traian for fourteene yeares should be called but an houre of temptation ans first in regard of god to whom a thousand yeares are but as one day therefore fourteene yeares is but a short time secondly in regard of eternall punishment in hell which we deserue this time of persecution is but a short time thirdly in regard of the persecutions of god people iacob serued twice seuen yeares for leah and they seemed a short time to him by reason of his affection to her so the affections that god people haue to the lord to his word and religion make them thinke many yeares persecution a short time paule for his affection and loue to christ thought eternall damnation but a yeare a short time so these in this church thought this long and bloudy persecution a short time an houre for that loue they had to christ and his gospell and the glory of god and for this affection could haue bene content to suffer it longer the end why christ vseth this phrase is to comfort this and al other churches in persecutions by the shortnes of their continuance which is but an houre a short time now though they last twentie yeares yet if we haue any affection to god glory and to his religion it will be but an houre a short time this consideration of the shortnes of time might incourage any man and arme him to endure any persecution crosse or affliction besides this which i haue said note that in these words there is a prediction there is a prediction of a thing to come namely an houre of temptation here christ foretelleth a thing not present but to come though not known to the church and that without the helpe of any creature man or angel which prophecying of this persecution vnder traian sheweth that he is true god for it is a propertie and priuiledge of god simply of by and from himselfe without helpe of any creature foreseeing of things in their courses to foretell a thing to come man cannot foretell any thing vnlesse it be present in the causes not simply then here we must know the cause why this persecution came to them rather then peace and why christ foretold it rather than peace the cause why christ saith this houre of temptation shall come is not any foreknowledge of christ or because he foretelleth it for things come to passe not because god foretelleth and knoweth them but because they be to come to passe therefore he foreseeth them and foreknoweth them the cause then why things come to passe is the will good pleasure amp decree of god act christ was put to death by the eternall counsell and decree of god so it was god will and pleasure not his foreknowledge or foreseeing that this persecution came on this church and the decree of god in the effecting of all things is the highest cause by which all things come to passe and that giueth being to al other causes obiect then god is the author of sin answer as god will and decree in the effecting of things is in the highest place so must we distinguish of the things he willeth for he willeth some things which he effecteth himselfe as all good things some things he willeth and yet doth not effect them but onely permits them to be done by other as sin and euill things which though they come not from his will yet they be according to his will not against his will for his will disposeth of sin and euill things and in all things good or euill his will disposeth and setteth downe the causes and circumstances of place time maner how the end ampc then their opinion is false which hold that certaine things as sin come to passe god onely foreseeing them not decreeing them to come to passe or permitting them now to giue god a bare foreseeing without decreeing is to rob him of his godhead and to take from him his prouidence by which he disposeth of all things seeing euery thing which is done cometh to passe by his will and decree he either decreeing and effecting it as all good things or permitting it as euill things the end why christ alleageth this prophecie is to expound the former words namely why he called the time of persecution a temptation because it should certainly come to trie the whole earth where we may note the propertie of any affliction persecution or crosse namely to trie a man to discrie what is in his heart whether there be grace and feare of god or hypocrisie and for this end is the crosse sent to man to make knowne either their faith or hypocrisie and there is nothing better to trie the heart of man then temptation and afflictio and then though thy heart was full of presumption before thou maist know what is in thee and iudge of thy selfe verse behold i come shortly here is christs commaundement in it note first the occasion it selfe secondly the reason to inforce it the commaundement hold fast namely with both hands as for life and death if thou haue receiued a litle measure of grace rather part with any thing then with it keepe it and preserue it till death but of this before the reasons to inforce this commaundement are two one before the other after the first behold i come shortly i wil come to thee shortly either by generall iudgement or else by particular iudgement by death now before it christ puts a word of attentio to shew that this comandement is not to be lightly passed ouer of vs but to be earnestly and often remembred now seeing christ teacheth vs that he will come shortly to vs in iudgement general or particular we must beleeue him and often haue it in memory that christ is not far off but wil come to vs shortly to shew our estate either in heauen or hell then we must beleeue it haue it written in our hearts and in our memories and not flat our selues we must not say that christ will deferre his coming he teacheth vs that he is at the doore he cometh shortly either by generall iudgement of all man or particular iudgement to vs then happy were we if we could as that auncient father did thinke we heare his trumpet sound continually in our cares and thinke in our hearts and remember this that christ wil not be long but will come very shortly and indeed the cause why man liue in sin amp neuer call themselues to an account is because man beleeue not and haue not learned this lesson that christ wil thus come shortly if me were thus perswaded in hart christ will come to me shortly to iudge me giue me my reward in heauen or hell surely if they belonged to god it would make them turne to him from their sinnes and breake off their wicked life nay though a man were most desperate yet this wold make him tremble to thinke how christ will come shortly to iudge him yes it wold make me if they had any spark of grace to labor to get faith and a good conscience seeing the christ is to come to iudge them shortly who would not repent who would not leaue his sins and turne to christ vnlesse he will cast his soule away then this is our duty to labour to get faith and a good conscience to iudge our selues that we may preuent christs iudgement againe this very consideration will make a man constant in all christian duties and lastly it wil comfort such as be in affliction for they may be sure their affliction shall not last alway for christ will come to iudgement shortly and he will free them from all their crosses and he will ere it be long giue them deliuerance now followeth the reason after the commaundement that no man take thy crowne from thee that is the crowne of glorie word to vse his sacraments reuerently else he will take them from vs put off our crowne and make vs a barbarous and brutish people giuen to all idolatry o then let vs hold these fast with both hands let all go honour riches preferment pleasures and our owne life ere we loose our glorious crowne of the gospell of christ for if we wil not hold it fast he will giue it to a nation which though now we cotemne yet they shall scorn amp hisse at vs and now that we heare of war and inuasions let these put vs in mind of greater iudgement and assure vs that if we make not more accompt of the word and sacraments and not only professe outwardly in bodie but in the seruice of god ioyne heart and hand be indeed as good professors as we beare the world in hand we are the lord will remoue our crowne and giue it to a nation which will bring foorth better increase and seeke to maintaine it better verse him that ouercometh will i make a pillar in the temple of my god here is set downe the promise which containeth two things first to whom the promise is made to him that ouercometh secondly the thing promised in the words following for the first he giueth to vnderstand that whosoeuer will haue his seruice pleasing vnto god must dispose himselfe to fight a good fight and to wage battell against all his enemy a man cannot be a good christian except he be a good souldier when he beginneth to turne to god then he hath innumerable enemy both within himselfe and without to make him take another course and turne from god now if he be not a good souldier these enemy will ouercome him for the second the thing promised is eternall life in these words i will make him a pillar in the temple of my god christ here alludeth to man in this world who haue bene wont to build pillars vpon hils and mountaines that the posteritie to come might remember them when they were dead and rotten sa absolom in his life had reared him vp a pillar which is in the kings dale for he said i haue no son to keepe my name in remembrance this then is the sense it is the custome of man to set vp pillars for the remembrance of their body but i will make the man himselfe that ouercometh a pillar in the temple that is in the church triumphant figured by the temple at ierusalem as if he should say others set vp pillars in fields and mountaines but i will make him a pillar in the temple of my god i will make him a pillar that is i will not onely make him a part but a worthie part in the temple my god this is set downe to shew that god is christs god as he is mediator otherwise as he is god the second person he is equall to the father and he shall go no more out first he shall abide a pillar for euer he shall not need renewing as the pillars of man do this pillar shall haue three names first the name of god whereby he doth signifie that he is the servant of god secondly the name of the citie of my god by citie is not meant the triumphant church but the place thereof namely the high heauens the meaning of it is i will make it manifest that he is a citize of the place of glorie this citie is described in the words following by a resemblance it is called new ierusalem because that was a citie that resembled paradise where adam was new ierusalem but how can it be called new ierusalem seeing it was before the earthly ierusalem answer it is called new not in regard of the being but in regard of reuelation for it was before the beginning of the world which came downe out of heauen from my god it is not said it shall come downe but it is come downe this clause is added to answer to an obiection which he that ouercometh might make thus heauen is farre off how can heauen come downe from heauen ans it cometh downe to vs by the preaching of the gospell for by it we begin to be citizens thereof ephesians the third name is my new name by the name of christ we are to vnderstand glorie and power ob but christ had glorie and power from all eternitie ans true he had so but this is to be meant as he is god incarnate now the ends and reasons which made him describe the estate of life euerlasting are these first to comfort them which keep faith and a good conscience he doth describe the reward thereof being an excellent meanes to incourage man to go forward in the faith learne we then in all our afflictions to keepe this faith and good conscience to the end by beholding the estate of life euerlasting and the reward thereof moses desired to suffer afflictions because he had respect to the recompence of the reward the second reason of this description is to bring man to view the excellencie of life euerlasting many man are drawne from religion because they take such pleasure in earthly matters which they would not if they thought eternall life so great a matter the third reason is to teach man to practise paules rule in the to tim to lay hold on eternall life man with both hands lay hold on the world both of honour and riches none layeth sure hold of life euerlasting though it be neuer so sweet pleasant blessed and glorious the fourth reason is to make the people of god not to feare the cruellest death that can be seeing bodily death is a doore to glory thus much generally of the twelfth verse now it followeth that i speake particularly i will make him a pillar that which the servant of god shall be in the church triumphant that they must beginne to be in the church militant if therefore thou wouldest be a pillar in heauen thou must begin to be one on earth by vpholding and maintaining the gospell againe in that he saith i will make him a pillar in ierusalem that is the church triumphant they must learne to amend their erronious opinion who thinke euery church as holy as ierusalem and is to haue the same reuerence and i will write vpon him that is he shall haue god for his god here he giueth vs to vnderstand that we can haue no fellowship with god but by christ god will neuer saue nor blesse vs out of christ his son if therefore thou wilt giue thankes to god thou must do it through christ if thou wilt receiue any temporall blessing of god it must be in and by not out of christ i will make him a citizen of the kingdome of heauen here we must learne to carrie our selues in this world as citizens of heauen and not of this world otherwise we can neuer looke for heauen philipp i will make heauen come downe here we may see the mercie of god to man heauen was shut vp by our sinnes but god hath opened it by the bloud of christ that we might enter therein therefore if we will haue the new name we must become new creatures for neither circumcision nor vncircumcision auaileth any thing but a new creature if we content our selues with the old man we shall neuer come to heauen verse let him that hath an eare heare what the spirit saith to the churches this is the last part of the epistle written to the church of philadelphia now whereas christ againe and againe repeateth the same words the ministers of the gospell haue a warrant if they preach the same sermon to the people yes though they preach it oftentimes but they must looke that they do it not for ease but for the good of the church and therefore the hearers hearing the minister repeate the same doctrine ought not curiously to reprehend him for then they may as well reprehend christ himselfe as before i haue shewed here then is a dutie commaunded namely to heare this hearing is the good learning that bringeth true faith saluation and sincere obedience with it but to whom is this commandement giuen to hearing hearers and to such as do not onely receiue the word of god with their outward eares but with the eare that is in the heart hence we learne first that god doth not giue to all man grace to heare his word to their saluation secondly that we must so heare that thereby we may be conuerted and changed but what is to be said namely what the spirit teacheth to the churches that we might heare attentiuely he vseth a double reason one drawne from the speaker another from the auditors to wit the churches but i haue spoken of these before and to the angell of the church of the laodiceans write ampc as before all the other epistles so before this last epistle there is a commandement giuen to john to write it and the epistle hath three parts as the former had first a preface secondly the matter thirdly a conclusion first of the preface wherin christ is described in whose name it was penned by two arguments first by his name and title amen a faithfull witnesse secondly by his priuiledge and propertie the beginning of the cratures amen is an aduerb of affirmation or asseueration signifying truly verily amp certainly the reason why he is so called is rendred in the words that follow which are a commentary and full exposition of this the faithfull witnesse ampc so that to this end he is called amen to shew that he is a true and faithfull witnesse see chap there i expound it and here i will repeate the heads onely of that exposition he is called a witnesse betweene god the father and vs because he doth not onely reueale the fathers will to vs but sealed it with his blood and giueth vs many testimonies inward and outward but of all testimonies that of the scripture is most certaine and for these three respects he is thus termed first because he doth reueale it and seale it and ratifie it by inward and outward testimonies secondly because he wold accomplish his fathers wil corinthian all the promises of god are in him yes and amen that is most certaine and therefore he is a witnesse yes a faithfull witnesse thirdly he is called a true witnesse because he speaketh the truth that which he reuealeth from his father is the will of his father who is truth it selfe he saith as the thing is without error or falshood nay his will is the rule of all truth this is the meaning of the first argument now the vse and the end why here christ is so called if we do but reade the epistle and marke the contents we may guesse probably at the end which is that he might shew himselfe an example to the angell of that church who was slacke and negligent in his ministery therfore christ instructs him how to cary himself without respect of persons teaching the word of god truly and faithfully see chap and not only to the angel but to all the church yes to all christians he propounds himselfe an example of two worthy vertues faith and truth he would haue all to be true and faithfull in their life and conuersation euen as he is this faith is a vertue whereby a mans word becometh as sure as an obligation as we vse to speake whereby we make good all our words othes and promises truth is that whereby a man without lying deceit or fraud speaketh the truth from his heart that i say which is necessary to be knowne for his owne and others good and for the glory of god set we this example before our eyes and as christ is a true and faithfull witnesse so let vs be carefull to shew our selues true in all our words and speeches and to be faithfull in all our promises these be excellent graces in christ and fruites of the spirit in christians therefore let vs be knowne by these to be like christ the second end of this title is to induce this church to apply it selfe to the word of god effectually for it was faultie in this point therfore that he might bring them to this he saith that he is a faithfull witnesse how should they do this thus consider in the word the law and the gospell the commaundements promises and threatnings and apply them particularly euery man to himselfe the commandements to know sinne the threatnings to humble vs and that we may be touched in conscience and made fit to receiue god grace see an example of it luke in the prodigall son i haue sinned and am not worthy ampc so daniel and ezra humbled themselues no man can truly be humbled till he make this particular application of the word which he readeth and heareth now the gospell also must be thus applied we are bound to beleeue the promises of life eternal not onely that they are true but to apply them to our selues the gospell requireth a further thing which is the foundation of the church for proofe see philipp the summe is this he esteemes all things losse in regard of christ and desires the righteousnes which is by faith in christ and to know the vertue of christs resurrection now marke the fifteenth verse let so many as be perfect be thus minded teaching euery one of vs our dutie to apply christ to our owne person thus are we bound in conscience to apply the gospell to our selues and whosoeuer doth not so he makes god a lier as much as in him lieth john and this is the principall end and reason why christ calleth himselfe so that man might not onely beleeue the word in general but apply it in particular to themselues the not doing of this is the cause of negligence in religon of so many luke warme christians and professors therefore let vs all learne this dutie it is not enough to know the word no nor to be able to teach it but aboue al things to lay it to the conscience to apply it that we may be truly humbled and turne to god therefore iustifying faith is that which applieth in particular now the second title of christ is the beginning of all creatures column by him all things were created in heauen and earth therefore in regard of creation he is so called yet i doubt not but there is a further cause why he is so called here namely because he is the beginning of the new creatures as ephesian where it is said we are god workmanship created in christ to good workes marke there euery christian is a workmanship of god to this purpose esay saith whe christ shal giue him selfe a free will offer he shall see his seed how thus all that are borne a new they are the seed of christ he is the beginning and roote and so much the very scope of this epistle declareth now he is such a beginning two waies first as he is the author of regeneration for whosoeuer is borne a new christ is the cause and author of his conuersion therefore esay he is called the father of eternitie because he doth regenerate man to life by his spirit and esay he saith loe here i am and the children that thou hast giuen me secondly as he is the matter thereof ephesian the church is flesh and bone of christ where the apostle alludeth to the creation of our first parents for adam was a figure of a man regenerate and as eue had her beginning from adams side so the church and euery christian haue their being and beginning from christ from his blood springs the church of god and all christians as they are new creatures and regenerate not as they are man and woman now the end why he is so called is to meete with a vice in that and other churches man haue more care and desire to seeme to be christians then to be christians indeed man set more by a shew then truth shadow then substance therfore he shewes that their principall care must be to be true christians indeed amp not to seeme so only this church was not regenerate in that church and therefore christ tels them of it that he is the beginning of new creatures and the same is our fault our care is not so much for the power of godlines as for the shew of it therefore i beg you haue care of this to heare the word and to receiue the sacraments are good things in their kind but they are not sufficient to saluation except thou become a true member of christ thou hast no good by them he saith this to meete with another vice that is spiritual pride he shewes that there is no excellencie in outward things all earthly excellecies are nothing without this wherby a man is a new creature therefore we must not stand vpon our pantofles for our birth or gentry but whosoeuer wil reioyce must reioyce in this that he hath christ for the author of his regeneration further this teacheth vs an excellent lesson that christ loueth and preserueth his church for as it was in the first adam so it is in the second adam the woman had not her beginning apart from man but of and from him that he might loue her the better and haue care of her preseruation so this is to teach vs that christ hath a care of vs and that we must honor him nay which is more adam was but the matter onely and not the author of heuah but christ is both to the church to shew his loue to be endlesse the root neuer hurts the branches nay it strengtheneth it selfe to defend cherish and maintaine the branches it hath no affection inclination or disposition to hurt but to helpe thus much of these words to note the bond betweene christ and his church yes his loue and our dutie hence i gather that the papists erre in teaching that a man hath the vse of his owne will in his regeneration and that he can dispose himselfe in his iustification for a creature cannot worke nor help to create himself but euery regenerate person is a creature of god and the conuersion of a sinner is here made the creation of a man the creature in his owne creation is able to do nothing if there were no more such sayings in the bible this one were sufficient to confute that opinion and thus much of the preface now the matter of the epistle or contents and substance verse i know thy workes ampc that thou article neither hote nor hote ampc the proposition hath two parts first a dispraise or reproofe secondly counsell the dispraise is for two faults the first lukewarmnesse the second pride and vanitie of mind then first i will make the words plaine secondly declare the vse of them i know that is all thy waies and workes be manifest to me and i vtterly dislike them and to lay open their fault the more he borroweth a comparison from water whereof there be these three sorts hote cold and warme cold and hote water may be receiued into the stomack with lesse hurt and annoyance but the water that is lukewarme troubleth the stomacke and ceasseth not till it be cast vp againe now with these three kinds of water he compareth three sorts of man by cold man vnderstand the enemy of religion as iewes and gentiles turkes and saracens gadarens and galileans by hote vnderstand man zealous in religion by lukewarm indifferent so the meaning is thou article neither an open enemy of religion nor yet truly religious or a true friend i would ampc christ here maketh a wish but he doth not simply wish that they were enemy of religion but in respect of their estate he wisheth they were either of those rather then as they were otherwise this absurditie would follow that christ should wish them to be of a people no people of god by lukewarmenesse he vnderstandeth a people professing the word of god and yet not greatly regarding and reuerencing it this people is a lukewarme people as if he should say a mixture of both neither hote nor cold wanting the heate of grace and the fire of god spirit whereby their hearts should be heated and inflamed verse because thou article neither ampc the meaning is this euen as a man that hath receiued such water will cast it vp and cannot keepe it in so christ being grieued with their sinnes will cast them off from hauing any fellowship with him and make them to be no church this is the true and right meaning of the words now in them these things are contained first christ setteth downe their fault and aggrauateth it secondly he compareth three kinds of man together the hote man hath the best place and the cold man the second and the lukewarme man the last and lowest so you see the enemie of religion and of god grace is better then he that professeth religion and liueth not thereafter as if he should say the ordinarie gospeller which contenteth himselfe to heare the word and to receiue the sacraments is not so good before god as the turke and iew the threatning followeth i will spue them out of my mouth now hauing found the meaning we must examine our selues whether we may not be charged with the same fault and it will be found that we are guiltie of this and euen plaine laodiceans which that you may see i will shew diverse kinds of such lukewarme gospellers and christians the papist though he seeme to make a great shew of loue to christ yet he performeth no such thing for he parteth stakes with christ and maketh himselfe to be his owne sauiour so that howsoeuer he pretend to be a most zealous catholike yet he hath no true grace the temporizer he which altereth his religion as times alter and such is the bodie of our people and they are not ashamed to confesse it that they will follow the prince and change their religio with the time and this sheweth what man will do if popery come againe they may say they are good christians but they shew themselues plaine laodiceans all such as follow nicodemus that is which loue christ but dare not come to him by day light such as thinke they may heare masse and yet keepe their conscience to themselues halting between god and baal such as are mediators and pacificators and would make an vnion betweene vs and the papists being perswaded that our religion and the papists are all one in effect for the matter and substance of it and that all the difference is only in circumstance so they write and defend their opinion but let them pretend what they will zeale of god glorie or whatsoeuer be it neuer so much they are but laodiceans a fift fort there is and who are they luke such as serue god and mammon and where are they nay where are they not lamentable is out time wherein man will needes be professors and yet how is all their time spent vpon care for this world the greatest part of their life and time is bestowed on that there is all their ioy care desire labour and studie let them say what they will so long as their care and studie is spent vpon mammon they are very laodiceans and such are the most part of our hearers they draw neare god with their lippes but their hearts are vpon their goods the whole heart is set vpon the world and the whole time of their liues is spent in this who they are your owne consciences will tell you they are indeed christians amp professors but lukewarme and worse then christs enemy they that heare the word and like it but in their liues giue themselues to sinnes blasphemie drunkennesse fornication oppression vsurie some to this vice some to that and euen in this very ranck i place those which professe religion but yet delight in the fond and irreligious fashions of the world vsing the new strange and monstrous fashions of apparell they spend so much time vpon their body that the soule goeth naked the world aboundeth with such now yong and old it is strange to see how absurd man are beyond all common reason in apparelling themselues so fondly whereas their garments shold put them in mind of their owne shame and nakednesse amp be no cause of glorying in them and the modest garments should shew the vertues of the mind now what do they else but shew the vanities and vices of our minds now shall we excuse our selues though we be none of these not intangled with the sinnes of the world no we cannot we shall find wants of the feare of god of hatred of sinne of the reuerend regard and estimation of the gospel which we ought to haue so as no man can say he is free from this nay euery man euen he that hath best grace shall feele in himselfe want of care and loue to god and his word therefore we must with iob lay our hands vpon our mouthes and say we are vile well this being so now consider the iudgement threatened lay it before your eyes marke the end and recompence christ will spue such out of his mouth that is cast them from god from christ and his church this threatning pertaineth to this age and therefore we must tremble and be ashamed and repent of this sinne left ere long we be spued out of his mouth thus much of the examination of this sinne now of the amendement of it where note first the fault secondly the greatnesse of it thirdly the punishment that is a separation from the church now i will proceed further to shew that euen among vs as well as in other places this sinne is to be found that euery one may be the better acquainted with his owne state and this appeareth by diverse signes first by common neglect of the duties of religion which is manifested diverse waies first though we come often and greedily to the church yet very few profit in knowledge and fewer in amendement of life and many that profit in knowledge something do thriue in obedience litle or nothing at all how true this is i appeale to euery mans conscience this is an euident argument of great negligence in all sorts take the body of our congregations amp they be as ignorant as any i know there be some which profit both in knowledge and practise but i speake of the greatest part experience in diverse occasions maketh this manifest the second token of this negligence is that few spend any time in reading of the word to search the scriptures amp try whether it be as they are taught or not nay few will be at the cost to buy a bible or if they haue one they will not take the paines to reade in it or to keep a constant course in reading of it daily a third signe is the prophanation of the sabbath though many come to church at the time appointed for publike worship and seruice yet there is no priuate sanctification of it at home but when the congregation is dissolued man betake themselues to their owne affaires profit delights and pleasures no such persons can possibly haue any great measure of knowledge or obedience and grace because they do not keepe times for this purpose by these signes it is plaine and euident yes palpable that there is great negligence in the duties of religion now where there is such negligence though coldnesse be wanting yet there is no heate and we are but lukewarme gospellers another sign of lukewarmnesse is this our religion stands on generals and reacheth not to our particular callings in the church we are good christians but when we come home to the particular duties of our priuate callings where is religion then where is the practise of that we heare there is no conscience made of lying deceiuing amp oppressing amp no care of that good dealing which ought to be in man al our religion is in the church and none at home whereas if religion were in the hart it would shew some fruit in our liues as fire and heate cannot be hidden although i doubt not but there be some of whom these sins take no hold yet there be many which professe that they be neither hot nor cold but in a meane between both and yet they will be partakers of the word and sacraments and when they see any haue care to obey they haue presently the name of precisenes ready for them because they haue care to do that which they professe in this very reproch they shew that they are lukewarme their mouthes proclaime it and their liues professe it and they are neuer a whit ashamed of it whosoeuer opens his mouth to fasten this reproch vpon his neighbor he fastens vpon himselfe this marke of luke warmnesse without shame and so they go beyond the laodiceans which were ashamed of it and would not defend it whereas these boast of it my meaning is not to fasten this vpon euery man but i say it is a common sin more then any other well now it being manifest that this is the common sinne of our time yes our common sin a sin that taketh hold of all sorts mark what followeth they are in a worse case then the heathen and infidel are the common christian is worse in some case then they for christ preferreth them before these a man may perswade himselfe that he is in a good estate for all that but you see christs iudgement amp sentence o it had bin better for them neuer to haue knowne the truth at all they are in a worse case which know god will and obey it not then they that neuer knew it let vs not deceiue our selues then if we be but drowsie protestant we are worse then turkes we boast of our estate and we despise the infidel but except thou ioyne with knowledge purpose of obedience thou article more vile and contemptible then they publicans and harlots shall come into heauen before thee it is not the external profession of religion that will make the better then they but grace in the heart and obedience and this is the first point the second point is that we are in danger to be spued out of christs mouth for this was written for our instruction and for all churches that as luke warme water troubleth mens stomackes so do we trouble christ and therefore are like to be cast out euen as that is we may flat our selues and thinke all is well as they did in noahs time but know it we are in danger of a most grieuous iudgement namely to be cut off from christ amp to be made no people though we had no more sins but this we are in danger to be cut off for it and god can do this diverse wayes either by taking his gospell from vs or sending in our enemy among vs and by example of other country the lord sets this before our eyes dayly how he can and will do this therfore let vs not stand vpon any outward priuiledge but lay this to our hearts and so much for the first sin the second vice followeth in the seuenteenth verse verse thou saist i am rich ampc here is a new reproofe of a new fault and that is spiritual pride these words depend on the former as a reason and cause for before they were charged with luke warmenesse now the cause of that is pride this is the mother that is the daughter thou saist that is thou thinkest thus it is the maner of the holy ghost to expresse the thoughts of man by speeches and when man thinke thus and thus the holy ghost saith they say thus and thus because as manifest as our speeches be to one another so manifest be our thoughts to christ in that christ doth thus expresse mens thoughts we may gather that this booke is canonicall for man cannot set downe in writing what be their owne thoughts much lesse other mens and so in all the bookes of scripture the thoughts and imaginations of man are set downe euen as they conceiue them the like cannot be shewed in any writings of man it remaineth therfore that we receiue this booke as the word of god for could the apostle john by any article or learning come to know their thoughts no now i come the thought he expresseth their pride by the effect of it that is their thought and what is their thought i am rich that is i abound with spirituall graces as knowledge iudgement vnderstanding and memory by this thought christ describeth their pride not outward but inward not carnal but spiritual whereby they perswaded themselues that they were in much better case and state then they were and this is the common sin of churches against this sin of pride learne we that christ came not to call the righteous but sinners to repentance but what is there any righteous since adams fal no but some thinke themselues righteous as did the proud pharises which said as the church of laodicea here i am rich and paul brings in the corinthians saying we shall raigne thus you see that this hath bin a common sin and so it is at this time in the popish churches this opinion takes place when they perswade themselues to satisfie god iustice for temporall punishments by their workes and that they can merite sufficiently for themselues and others and amongst vs this wretched thought finds harbour we thinke we abound with knowledge none will seeme to be ignorant or to want knowledge and therefore not one of a hundred will aske a question nay many therefore will not heare the word because they know as much for substance as the preacher can tell them for all a mans dutie say they is but to feare god and keepe his commaundements and thou shalt loue god aboue all and thy neighbour as thy selfe and what would you more thus they perswade themselues that they are rich and want no knowledge when they know not one principle of religion more then the law of nature teacheth them namely do as you would be done to others pleade that they haue had euer since they could remember such a strong faith that they neuer doubted of god mercy but this is no strong faith but a strong presumption and a strange faith for true faith is alway ioyned with doubting and distrusting others professe that they are rich in loue and they will not be drawne from it but they loue god and their neighbours when they haue neither knowledge faith nor loue which appeareth thus let a man make relation of any bodily calamitie and you are astonished but let the ministers tel you that you are in danger of spirituall iudgement and who is afraid where is the person that trembleth worldly newes troubleth you but the word neuer scares you the remembrance of your owne damnable estate grieueth you not let vs say what we will of your soules state alas you regard it not but the drunkard will continue in his drunkennesse and the adulterer and blasphemer in their wickednesse and euery man blesseth himselfe in his sins and saith god loues him and he loues god i am rich in regard of god fauour of spirituall blessings ampc this being our sin it stands vs all in hand to labour to see it and to be humbled for it increased in wealth or made rich this is added only for amplification to shew the measure of their pride that it was not small but great therefore the word is doubled to shew the strength of their conceipt and the greatnesse of their pride now what is the cause why they were not onely puft vp but giuen to such an high degree of pride answer knowledge was the cause for no doubt but the angell of that church had great knowledge and was a learned man and the people were well instructed now knowledge puffeth vp it maketh mens hearts to swell with pride therfore it is true that where much knowledge is there is much pride if man want the grace of humiliation and griefe for sinne and haue need of nothing here is a further marke and token of their pride when a man thinkes thus that he needs no help for his saluation if he stands in no need of christs blood for the saluation of his soule this is a notable signe of abundant pride in the heart this serueth further to conuince our congregration of this pride for if we be neuer so litle sicke straight we seeke to the phisitians but though our soules be neuer so sicke none seeke to the ministers sicknesses we feele but not sins therefore the phisitian is in request but the minister is not thought of till the pangs of death be felt this shewes that we abound in spirituall pride therfore marke this you must labour to feele what need you haue of christ for til you do so there is no grace in the heart if you would haue grace learne this that you want the bloud of christ and till you feele this neuer thinke your case good but wretched and damnable it is a daungerous case for a man to say he wanteth nothing and knowest not here he setteth downe the cause of their pride that is ignorance as if he should say thou knowest not thine owne naturall estate as thou wert borne of adam thy state out of christ thus we see that ignorance is the cause of pride and pride of lukewarmenesse by this he sheweth what they are ignorant of hence it may be gathered that pride was not the first sinne nor the roote of all other sinnes as the papists and some other thinke indeed it is a great sinne and a mother sinne yet it hath a more inward cause that is ignorance whereof euen of a mans owne estate before god so much christ here signifieth the cause why any thinke wel of themselues and swell in pride is the ignorance of their owne estate and because they are ignorant of that therefore they are puft vp with pride by this we must all be admonished to haue care to learne to know our owne estate in which we are by nature without christ euery person that will come to saluation must be throughly acquainted with his owne estate and know his owne sinnes and the curse due to them and therefore it is that the prophets so often call vpon the people to search and fanne themselues that they might be acquainted with their owne estate till you know this you shall be but proud peacocks amp neuer haue grace although you haue otherwise very great gifts of knowledge and grace to conceiue a prayer amp be able to teach yet you shall neuer haue any grace to turne and repent truly till the ignorance of your state be remoued and then cometh grace true obedience and humiliation and other graces needfull for god seruice therefore labour for it if there be any blemish in your face you will see it o then labour to see the spots of your soules now in that christ doth thus strike at the roote of their pride and bewray their ignorance he sheweth the state of euery man by nature so that here cometh to be handled the naturall estate and miserie of man the miserie of this church is propounded two waies first generally secondly particularly generally in two words wretched and miserable wretched that is one subiect to misery griefe and calamities so much is signified by the first word that we may know what this miserie is i will enter into a description of mans wretchednesse where two things must be considered first the roote and fountaine of it namely originall sinne which hath two branches first that very particular offence and trespasse whereby adam sinned which is not onely the sinne of his person but of mans nature and of euery one that cometh of adam christ excepted secondly from that sinne as a part of it and yet withall as a punishment of it followeth the corruption of mans heart and defacing of god image whereby the heart hath got a pronenesse and disposition or inclination to all sinne in these two stand mans miserie for from these do spring al our miseries both in and after this life so much for the first part what mans miserie is againe we must conceiue it vnder the forme of a punishment all miserie of what kind soeuer is a punishment laid vpon man for that first sinne now the punishment of sinne must be considered diverse waies according to the diverse times of mans being either in this world or departed hence all punishment is either in this life or in the end of it or after and so is miserie in this life in the end of it or after it againe some miseries concerne the whole man and they are two principally first a subiection to god wrath whereby a man is in daunger thereof euery day amp made a child of wrath this is a miserie of all miseries and so much the more grieuous as a man cannot without some grace see it secondly bondage to the diuell the scripture speaketh of it oftentimes you may conceiue it thus the man regenerate saith i sin but i would not sinne the naturall man saith i sinne and i will sinne it is my nature to sinne and my pleasure and in sinne will i liue and these are the two miseries concerning the whole man now there be miseries which concerne not the whole man but the bodie or soule goods or calling in this life miseries concerning the soule are these first in the mind and vnderstanding there is blindnesse and ignorance of god will secondly in diverse persons madnesse and foolishnesse all these are miseries curses and punishments inflicted on mans soule for sin and further that nothing can be learned without paines and difficultie further in the mind there is a conscience and there is accusation secret feares and terror and so many accusations so many miseries in the will there is rebellion and in the affections peruersenesse which is not onely a sinne but a plague and punishment and as the soule so the bodie is subiect to his miseries to many paines aches and diseases yes the diseases of mans bodie are so many that all physicke bookes cannot record them besides diseases there is mortalitie that is a subiection to death so as all the article and skill in the world cannot preuent it in our goods the want of necessaries is a miserie and by reason of sinne a punishment and in it owne nature a curse and all the hurt that cometh by the creatures whereas they be at enmitie betweene themselues or with man it is a curse for mans sinne and in that they be subiect to vanitie too all is for the punishment of our sinnes further all losses and damages and crosses whatsoeuer and wants of temporall blessings they are miseries the like we may say of all callings for there is none but it is subiect to griefes and vexations no man can carie himselfe so in any calling but he shall feele some woe and miserie and as in this life so in the end of this life the miserie is bodily death that is a separation of the soule from the bodie which if man had not fallen should haue remained vnseparable this in it owne nature is a fearefull curse for it is the very gate of hell and after this life followeth the full accomplishment of god wrath all the miseries in this life are but preparations to that then cometh destruction endlesse in the place of the damned for this destruction is first a separation from god and excludeth man from all societie with him secondly an apprehension of god wrath in the whole man bodie and soule for euer thirdly it is in the place of the damned with the diuell and his angels therefore this miserie is the summe and accomplishment of all miseries the rest are but beginnings of this thus you see what mans miserie is now then considering what is the fountaine of our miserie originall sin amp what is the nature of miserie namely it is a curse and punishment we see what it is to be wretched and miserable thou article wretched that is tainted with sinne and subiect to punishment for it in this life in the end of it and after it now touching this generall point we are to consider the end why christ saith this and knowest not ampc which is that he might teach them and vs to learne to know our miserie and to feele it and to be touched in conscience for it whosoeuer shall but lightly reade ouer this epistle shall see that this is the very end of it for they thought themselues to be highly in god fauour when it was nothing so indeed i pray you all therefore which are now assembled here to heare things touching eternall life and the saluation of your soules forsake amp abandon other conceipts and turne your eyes to this that you may see what be the miseries to which you are subiect and when you see them go further labour that your hearts may be touched that you may euen crie out with the man of ierusalem what shall we do till then we shall be like these laodiceans neither hote nor cold we shall neuer haue true and sound religion in vs till we feele the waight of our miserie i acknowledge that the sight of our miserie is god grace but go to the root and seeke that all pride may be expulsed and you may embrace the gospell which ministreth a remedie for all miserie but thou article miserable this word miserable signifieth one that is worthy to be pitied which he vseth to expresse the greatnesse of their misery meaning that they were so far subiect to misery that they were to be pitied of all man so that this is not added to shew any new thing but to inlarge the former learne we hence that it is not our dutie to disdaine a sinner that is in misery or to reproch amp scorn but to pitie him the more grieuous sinner a man is the more he is to be pitied it was dauids maner so to do sam and he was so farre from contemning a sinner that he shed river of teares psalm and ezec the good man was moued with the bowels of compassion when the people were sinfull the like is in ier it was the corinthians fault when the incestuous man had sinned they were neuer a whit humbled or moued with pitie but puft vp with pride and contempt so that they scorned him and paul reprooueth it in them and this is a fault in many of vs that man are not humbled when they see other man sinne our hearts are not touched with sorow for it but rather puft vp if we haue receiued more grace then other let vs not despise or scorne them which haue not the like measure thus much of their misery in generall as for the particulars they are in number three that he might strike their hearts with a sense of their misery he is not content to set it downe in generall termes but enters into particular names three maine miseries of theirs the first word signifieth one so poore that he hath not a rag to his backe nor a bit of bread to put in his mouth more then he gets by begging but here he meaneth spiritual pouertie which what it is we shall best vnderstand when we know what is true riches to wit the grace and fauour of god in christ for the pardo of sins to life euerlasting so the poore man is he that wants this that hath no good thing acceptable to god who in regard of his soule is as a begger which hath nothing for the maintenance of this temporall life thus you haue the meaning of this first word now the end likewise is to be considered why christ calleth them poore namely that they and we might striue to see our pouertie that we might become poore in spirit for they thought themselues rich therefore christ to beate downe this conceit and to prepare them to true grace tels them they are poore in regard of grace and life eternall and here we are taught a principall point of religion namely to feele our owne pouertie that we haue no goodnesse in vs and therefore to despaire vtterly of our saluation in regard of our selues this is greatly commended in the scriptures therefore learne another dutie as we are by nature poore and haue no goodnesse in our selues so labour to see it and to be out of heart with our selues that is to be poore in spirit otherwise you may come to church heare the word receiue the sacraments but neuer haue saluation or haue spirituall blessings except you be first acquainted with your poore estate that you are very beggers nay more plaine bankerupts for so christ taught vs to pray forgiue vs our debts therfore christ tels the proud church of her pouertie happie and blessed were our state and condition if we could learne this and lay aside our pride for we are so poore that we must pleade nothing but pardon no merit or satisfaction if we did this then would we esteeme aright of the gospell and haue some comfort by it now because we haue not this we do not embrace the gospel heartily and chearfully as we ought cary therefore away this lesson with you that the beginning of all grace is to feele the want of grace to acknowledge your pouertie and to be touched for it and grieued euen from the bottome of your hearts amp to feele this as sensibly as the begger feeleth his misery deceiue not your selues god word must stand till you be beggers the gospell wil be but a dreame and a fancie to you quest but how can christ call her poore seeing it was a very rich people ans it is true indeed they were very rich so history do record but as it was a rich citie so it was a poore church for all the wealth in the world is pouertie without the fauour of god in christ we are complete in christ without him we haue nothing all things are yours and you christs and christ god all temporall blessings are nothing out of christ riches are no riches honours no honors out of christ in christ we are complete and therefore rich laodicea is but a poore and beggerly people and so are all without christ therefore if god haue giuen you riches lay vp a good foundation vse then for this end that they may further and not hinder your saluation as helpes and meanes thereof otherwise they will be your ruine and destruction so much for the first part of mans pouertie the second part is blindnesse how can they be said to be blind they had no doubt an excellent teacher indued with great knowledge and ability to teach and i doubt not but the people were well instructed answer it cannot be denied but they had great knowledge yet they are called blind first because they knew not their own estate for though a man had al the skil and knowledge in the world he were but a blind man without this knowledge secondly because they knew not god in christ they knew god in general as many do now but not by a particular application to themselues that god was their god in christ and christ their redeemer they were content to know the gospell generally amp confusedly thirdly because they could not vnderstand things that differred it is a great gift of god to be able to discerne things that differ earthly things from heauenly and temporall from spirituall therefore let vs learne this lesson all knowledge is but ignorance if a man know not himselfe and god to be his god and christ his sauiour let a man be brought vp in the best schooles of learning and haue the most absolute gifts that can be though he go beyond all man in diuine and humane knowledge and learning if he know not himselfe and his state before god he knoweth nothing christ sets this marke vpon the angel of this church and yet no doubt he was a learned man but it shewes he had no care to know him self therfore content not your selues to haue the knowledge of the gospell or humane learning but learne to know that god is thy god and christ thy redeemer and that his blood was shed for thy sins dauid intitleth the psalm his learning and yet what great or deepe learning is there but this that he is blest which hath the pardon of his sins which he proueth by his own example and indeed this seasoneth al learning when you know christ till you do this you are blind as these were the last point of mans misery is nakednes which is two fold first to the eyes of man secondly to the eyes of god corporall and bodily nakednesse is two fold first before the fall and that was an excellent kind of nakednesse whereby their body being vncouered were full of glorie without shame but that is not meant here secondly since the fall sinful and shameful nakednesse where the bodie is ful of deformitie and all parts of it should be couered but that for necessities sake the face and hands are left bare besides this corporall nakednesse there is a spirituall nakednes which god seeth and man cannot see that is when a man lieth open and naked before god as moses saw the people naked not that their body were vncouered but their soules rather their sin appeared to god and they in their sins and so they lay subiect to god iudgements this is spiritual nakednes a plague of all plagues and a miserie of all miseries when god beholds man in their sins now in that christ saith this church was wretched and miserable and a part of her miserie was her spirituall nakednesse we learne diverse instructions first not to couer our sins before god eies for we stand al naked and vncouered before him the studie and care of most man is to hide their sins from the world but few care for couering them that god may not see them looke as ye haue seene lazer man lay open their nakednes before you so god seeth your nakednes let al carelesse and negligent persons remember this whosoeuer considereth this seriouslie they will be ashamed to neglect this dutie further let vs consider the end why christ saith they were naked it is that al man might haue care to set themselues before god and bring themselues into his presence and not seeke to hide themselues from god as adam did that they may obtaine a couering we must al learne to know our owne nakednes and be perswaded that god seeth al our sins then we must be humbled and touched for them then we must pray for a couering it was dauids practise blessed is the man whose sins are couered first he vnfolds his nakednes and then intreateth the lord to couer his sin giuing vs to vnderstand that he had laid open his nakednes so also should we all do shew the wounds and scars of our soules that god may giue vs a garment to couer vs that we may all be partakers of the couering of christs righteousnes labour to feele your pouertie and nakednes for till you feele your owne miserie you are neuer fit for christ further christ saith this to prepare them and vs for the good counsel following therefore let this be the conclusion if you haue receiued any grace labour to increase in it if not labour to haue it learne to know your owne pouerty blindnes and nakednes and to feele it and be touched for it be humbled seriously and throughly this must be the needle to draw god grace through your hearts verse i counsell thee ampc now followeth the counsell of christ in the three next verses in which he propoundeth a most excellent and sufficient remedie of their miserie in which note three things first the maner of prescribing the remedie by way of counsell secondly the remedie it selfe gold apparell and eye salue thirdly the means to obtain it buy of me of these in order the maner of prescribing is mild in it christ taketh vpon him the person of a counsellor to his church for as god hath his church and people so in mercie he giueth them counsell and counsellers the president of this councell is christ prou counsell is mine saith wisedome isay christ is called that counseller he is both king of and counsellor to his church and surely this title of right belogeth to him for first by his office he aduiseth man how they shall escape eternall death and be saued secondly he teacheth how a man may please god in all his actions thirdly how he may flie sinne these three he doth daily in his church and children and that not by extraordinarie but euen by ordinarie meanes as by his word and spirit and therefore may well be called our counseller neither can any either angell or man thus counsell vs but onely christ now in that christ is such a person by office and profession therefore we must acknowledge him to be our counsellor yes the counseller of the catholike church and euery part therof therefore we learne to do him all the honour we can counsellors of the common law are feed reuerenced and honoured for their counsell though it be but for worldly matters and it oftentimes faileth much more is christ to be honoured whose counsell concerneth the things of god and cannot faile but shall stand nay as his counsell is infinitely more excellent then the counsell of any other creature so much more is he to be honoured further in all dangers and temptations one must resort to christ for counsell for to this end is he a counseller he told them they were miserable and therefore gaue them counsell declaring that he is at hand in all our miseries and distresse and therefore we must resort to christ for his counsell and rest vpon it and order our selues according to it the good king iehosaphat when the moabites and ammonites banded together was in great distresse but what did he we said he know not lord what to do but our eyes are toward thee that is we looke to thee for counsel and direction we must rest amp rely vpon thee for wholesome counsel amp good direction so should all man do in distresse and daunger as we are now by reason of our sinnes and the professed malice of our enemy for by all likelihood these dayes are the time of our chastisement and correction therefore we must say as he said therefore in all distresse whether it be sicknesse or pang of death forsake all ill counsell go not to wizards and astrologians for helpe but humble your selues and pray for his counsell so much for the first part that is the maner of prescribing this remedie now of the remedie it selfe as the miserie had three parts and those great miseries all so christ propoundeth his remedie in such sort that it is answerable to the three branches of the miserie first gold that thou mayest be rich secondly rayment thirdly eye salue by gold according to the analogie of the scripture we are to vnderstand the graces of god spirit as true faith repentance feare and loue of god amp man all these are called gold as the triall of our faith is said to be more precious then gold we may likewise vnderstand al other gifts of the spirit yes all christs merits amp christ himself the fountaine of all purged by the fire that is precious and fine gold of speciall account that is purged from all drosse by the article of man this sheweth what is the propertie of his gifts and graces they are as precious as fine pure gold as pet this is worth the marking that the gifts of god spirit are of great price and value and that before gold psalm math this teacheth all how to beautifie themselues in soule and bodie the blind and false opinion of the world is that strange attire and forreine fashions beautifie and adorne the bodie and it is commonly thought that iewels and precious stones adorne vs and indeed it is true in some persons such as be great personages but strange fashions and outlandish attire disgraceth the bodie the right way to beautifie the bodie indeed and to make it truly glorious and to adorne the soule also i to get these graces for these are as precious as fine gold our body shold be the temples of the holy ghost amp the houses of a worthie guest therefore we should the rather labour for the best ornaments and if you will adorne your selues as you ought you must do it with the graces of god spirit and abhorre these fond and absurd fashions which no wise man can like of that thou maist be rich ampc these graces haue a further effect and serue not onely to adorne and beautifie but also to make man rich here then see the common folly nay madnesse of man which spend all their time wit and strength to enrich their body and leaue their soules vnfurnished what a madnesse is this that so many should neglect true riches and studie for nothing more then that which is nothing lesse then riches euen counterfeit riches by this text it is more then manifest that such are more then mad and that this folly is very great therefore seeing true riches be the graces of god spirit seeke for these so much for the first part of the remedie white garments that is christ himselfe and his righteousnesse imputed as gal euen as a garment is put on the bodie so is christ and his righteousnesse and the fruite thereof that is sanctification all this is meant by garments here now the end is to couer the nakednesse of the soule which is deformed and defiled with sinne eye salue that is the spirit of illumination knowledge wrought in the mind by the spirit of god for as eye salue doth cleare the eye sight and sharpen the same where it was by some occasion hindred so doth christ by illumination make a man know and vnderstand god in christ and discerne betweene good and euill of things temporall and eternall thus you haue the meaning of these words now by the exposition you may see that by all these we can vnderstand nothing but christ himselfe and his merits one and the same thing is signified by three words to shew that there is in christ the fulnesse of grace and that he hath remedies for all our wants the laodiceans were poore in spirituall goods and christ was their riches naked and he their garment blind and he their eye salue so that looke how many sinnes there be in man so many contrarie remedies there be in christ what wants soeuer be in vs he hath a supply of them all the papists make him an insufficient sauiour in that they patch our merits to his and so they disgrace christ but we are to count christ a most perfect and absolute mediator and redeemer in himselfe without vs to buy the meanes how these worthie gifts of god are gotten christ saith by buying and bargaining he saith not receiue but buy this is an allusion to the state of that citie which was rich and consisted most of merchant which liued by buying and traffic therefore he speaketh to them in their owne kind as if he should say you are a people exercised in buying and selling and are delighted with nothing more therefore come i haue wares for you of sundrie sorts gold garments and eyesalue buy of me then the word buy must not be vnderstood properly for so we can buy nothing of christ but all is giuen vs this is said onely by way of resemblance and i will shew wherin it standeth the principal things in bargaining are these first a man that is to buy seeth his want amp desireth to haue it supplied secondly he cometh to the place where it may be had calleth for it looketh on it and liketh it thirdly he maketh the price and value of it he cheapeneth it fourthly he giueth money for it or money worth and so buyeth it fiftly if it be a great summe he giueth earnest in hand so by a certaine proportion and resemblance there is a kind of bargaining between vs and christ for a man must feele himselfe to stand in need of christ and of his merits and so see his owne want and miserie for because man see want of bread meate drinke and cloth in their houses therefore they go to buy of the baker brewer butcher and draper ampc well then looke how sensibly a man feeleth the want of these things so euidently should we feele our want of christ and his merits and as the feeling of our want is the beginning and occasion of our going to buy so it should be in this our merchandise againe we should hunger and long after christ as a buyer taketh liking of and longing for that he wanteth and is thereby stirred vp to buy so besides the sense of our want we should hunger and thirst after christ besides we must prize christ at so high a rate that we count all things else as drosse and doung as paule counted most excellent things no better we must value him aboue ten thousand worlds lastly we must make an exchange how seeing we can giue him nothing but his owne therefore he saith come buy without money simon magus would haue bought him for money and was deceiued yet there must be an exchange we must giue him all our sinnes and receiue his righteousnesse see here a most blessed exchange for our shame and confusion we haue christs righteousnesse and his merits how thus when we begin to humble our selues and pray for remission and reconciliation then this change is made though we can giue him no earnest yet he giueth vs earnest what is that it is some portion of god spirit some small measure of his grace that is our earnest that we shall haue the kingdome of heauen and thus heauen is bought and sold betweene christ and vs when the heart mourneth for sin and praieth for pardon and purposeth to sin no more this is the worke of god spirit in vs and the earnest of our eternall saluation in heauen be our graces neuer so few or small it is a sufficient earnest as a penie is for a bargaine of a hundred pound seeing all these things concurre to the receiuing of christ therefore he calleth it bargaining so this point is plaine how this spirituall bargaine is made and why it pleaseth christ to terme it so now we see that we are commaunded this dutie but how stands the case with vs surely though many come to church few make that bargaine which is mentioned we are like passengers by sea which see many goodly buildings fruitfull lands soiles and sumptuous cities but they make no purchase of them so we come and heare the word but where is the partie that makes this bargaine with christ come to particulars i appeale to all your consciences who almost feeleth or seeth his owne want and miserie man can soone see the want of necessaries in their houses but this they cannot see and as for the desire of christ and longing for him there is none when you are drie or hungrie you can say you are drie and hungrie but who saith i thirst for christ if we looke to our estimation of christ we are plaine gadarens and of esawes mind we set more by a messe of red pottage and esteeme the basest things aboue christ and his merits nay we are loth to part with our sins and to take his righteousnesse we will rather keep them stil then change for the better who taketh christs righteousnesse and declareth it by fruites we can be content to loade christ with our sins but we wil not be loden with his righteousnes is this a good change no it is not euery man can say he must rise betimes which shall go beyond him in base and earthly bargaines but who hath regard of this excellent and heauenly bargaine then to conclude i pray you al make this bargaine with christ and do it presently let it be your first worke you are carefull to put your children to good trade and you do wel but be as carefull that they may make this bargaine and you shall do much better this is the cheapest and the best bargaine that euer was made it will make you and yours rich for euer as for other bargaines many cannot get them and many loose them when they haue gotten them this onely is durable verse as many as i loue ampc we haue heard a sharp reproofe and as sharp a threatning by which because they might take occasion to doubt and despaire of god mercie and fauour in christ iesus therefore now he takes away all occasion in the and verses first thus if i vse to rebuke and chasten all that i loue then you need not doubt of my mercie albeit i rebuke and threaten you so this i take it is the proper occasion of these words now see the meaning i loue christ loueth the creatures two wayes first as a creator secondly as a redeemer as he is a creator he loueth them with a generall and common loue whether the creatures be reasonable or vnreasonable as redeemer he loueth them with a speciall and peculiar loue not comon to all but to that part of mankind onely which is elected and chosen to saluation and of this last loue he speaketh here as if he should say as many as i loue communicating with them my righteousnes and life eternall i rebuke the word hath a larger extent and signification first to conuince one of a fault and then to checke or reproue the person and it cannot well be rendred in one english word and chastice that is with such a kind of correction which a father vseth to his child which is called nurture to breake a child of his fault and to teach him obedience and so it is vsed prouer whence this text is borrowed the meaning then briefly is this all those persons whom i loue i conuince of their particular faults and rebuke them and like a louing father i chastise them and nurture them to breake them of their vices and bring them to amendment now for the vse of these words christ sets downe his ordinarie dealing with his servant which is by reproofe and chastisement and diverse visitations for this very end that he might conuince them and correct them euery member of christ must come vnder his rod therefore looke for it yes marke further christ layeth vpon all his servant afflictions in diverse sorts according to the diverse dispositions of mens natures such as will hardly be broken of their faults he laieth vpon them more sharp punishments where man are easier to be amended there he vseth milder correction the vse of this is two fold prouerb the first is despise not the lord chastisemet for it is a token of his loue whesoeuer he reprooueth or afflicteth thee by visitations and crosses make not light account but make profit of it the second is faint not arme thy self with patiece because it is the lord maner to chastise those that he loueth and so many chastisements so many pledges and pawnes of his loue towards his servant by this christ is an example to all parents and gouernours they must giue tokens of loue in necessarie corrections that their children and servant may be brought from their misdemeanure for this end chastisement should be vsed it were to be wished that all parents and maisters did vse to giue correction thus but our case is lamentable in this respect man thinke it enough to prouide foode and raiment for their houshold all their care is for the bodie only and they neuer seeke to reforme their misdemeanours in life this negligence brings many sinnes with it and pulleth many iudgements vpon vs so much for the second point amend againe marke the order of the words rebuke and chasten here we haue a necessary instruction seeing christ first propounds a direct end of his chastisement that is their amendment which that he may the better effect first he conuinceth them secondly he reprehendeth and thirdly chasteneth them and all these tend to our amendment a worthie and excellent order and to be followed of all gouernors they must propound a good end of all chastisements first the good of the partie chastised then they must vse this order first a conuiction of the conscience by the word of god secondly reprehension thirdly correction if the two former wil not serue which being so you see how they ouershoote themselues that make correction serue for nothing but a meanes of reuenge an action of choller and rage without any purpose to better the partie whereas this order vsed would reforme the person and stop many vices and nip them euen in the head to some it is as good as meate and drinke to be fighting and brawling be zealous here is a remedie for luke warmnesse in the eight verse they had a remedie for pride now he maketh a plaister for luke warmnesse here first marke how these words depend on the former christ had said whom i loue i vse to chastise according as their faults be greater or less therefore seeing i haue corrected thee repent where we are taught the vse of all reproofes admonitions and visitations the speciall end of them is to driue vs to amend as oft as the lord doth either by word reproue or by deed correct vs it is to shew that we must repent and amend therefore whensoeuer you are visited say the lord summons you to repent take an occasion by the visitation of further reformation yes know it that so many afflictions are so many sermons of repentance to make you grow and increase in faith repentance and obedience now that we may the better vnderstand what this commandement be zealous meaneth diverse points are to be handled first what zeale is zeale is an affection that is compounded of two affections loue and indignation or sorow therefore first we must loue christ aboue all things if we will be zealous secondly we must be grieued and angred when christ is dishonoured loue of religion and griefe for the want of good successe therof will make man zealous we haue an example in christ ioh where thus much is signified that his loue to his father was so great that the heate of his indignation had almost consumed him he preferred the accomplishment of his fathers will before all in the second place note the diverse kinds of zeale good that is true or bad that is counterfeit to a good zeale there is required first true faith secondly repentance thirdly knowledge as for faith it is the very root of good zeale for as paule saith loue is from faith vnfained tim now zeale is an affection compounded of loue and faith and as for repentance we see that zeale and it are conioyned in this place iehu indeed was zealous but because he repented not but liued in the sins of his predecessors it was no good zeale and for the last we must know that zeale without knowledge is but rashnesse and thus you see how to distinguish true zeale from counterfeit euen by the companions of it now further by the fruites it may be discerned first it compelleth a man to please god in all things it will enforce one ouer rule and maister him corinthian whether we be out of our wit we are in it vnto god ampc the very loue of christ and his gospell inforced him that he could not but preach so wheresoeuer this true zeale is in any measure it will make a man that he cannot but do his dutie it will burst foorth and find an issue like a flame as elihu said he could not containe his belly would burst secondly it will make a man indeuor to obey god with all his heart strength amp power example good king iosia turned with all his heart dauid prayed with grones vnspeakable according to the multitude of thy mercies ampc and so goeth on maruellous earnestly and feruently he prayed not slackly and coldly but with all his force and power from the heart for pardon and reconciliation and so when he gaue thankes he saith my soule praise the lord and all that is within me ampc psalm thus you see what be the fruites of zeale and what it is to be zealous in a word then it is this to haue our hearts enflamed with a loue of christ and his word aboue all things and to be exceeding angrie when it is disobeyed enforcing vs to do our dutie with all the strength we haue now to end this point we heard before that lukewarmenesse in religion is our sinne generally throughout the land our zeale is cold and our profession but formall how shall we reforme this become zealous beare a feruent loue to religion loue christ aboue all and be grieued when you see him dishonored or his word disobeyed and false worship established away with this slacknesse in religion otherwise it had bene better you had bene of no religion then to be neither hote nor cold a man were better be a turke or a iew then a lukewarme christian for they are better then such and such professors are worse then they and amend this is added because zeale without repentance is but counterfeit zeale as iehues was but of what vices must they repent euen of lukewarmenesse they were not bidden repent because of any grosse sinnes that they had committed but for slacknesse in performing good duties here is a good lesson for our common people which say because they are no grosse sinners as adulterers theeues murtherers but meane well hurt no man and liue peaceably their case is good they despise preaching and neuer thinke how the want of practising good duties is a thing that they should repent for but they are to know that they are summoned to repent for want of good duties though they do no euill this is the diuels inchantment he rocketh them asleepe with it you may haue all these things and yet be condemned and go to hell and yet this is a common opinion and spread ouer euery where but know it thou maist liue and die with thy good meaning and peaceable liuing and yet be damned if thou repent not verse behold i stand at the doore ampc lest any should despaire because he had reproued them so sharpely and menaced them so seuerely he addeth these words which are to confirme the church against doubting by shewing signes of his loue now before he setteth downe the speciall tokens of his loue he saith behold in which very note of attention we haue a necessarie instruction to teach vs that if we would arme our selues against doubting we must acquaint our selues with the tokens of god loue lay them to our hearts and remember them we haue of this an example in dauid psalm in all the verses saue the last he rehearseth god goodnesse and his particular blessings whereupon he inferreth this conclusion therfore without all doubt i shall liue long to praise god and all this came from the particular obseruation of god goodnesse therefore if you would not stand in doubt of god mercie obserue his dealing and his loue in christ as plentifull tokens of his prouidence they being laid together worke in vs peace of conscience and ioy in the holy ghost there is no man so full of despaire and doubting but if he lay these things together and obserue diligently all the tokens of god fauour he shall find store of comfort therefore looke backe to your liues what tokens of god loue you haue receiued and in the time of trouble that will be a remedie against desperation i stand christ expresseth his mind by borrowed speeches for in this verse he compareth euery man to a house or housholder and our hearts to doores by which an entrance is made and himselfe to a guest or stranger which cometh to the house and desireth to be let in and entertained yet not so much to looke for kindnesse to be shewed him as to shew fauour to vs by this similitude christ purposeth to shew this church what his mind is toward it and he expresseth it by two signes here set downe first a desire of their conuersion which he heartily seeketh and looketh for i stand and knocke secondly his promise after their conuersion if any ampc he will haue fellowship euen mutuall fellowship with them now of the words in order as they lie the scope and substance of them being thus first thus generally propounded i here note two things first that this church if we regard the greatest part of it had not true fellowship with christ as yet nor christ with the because he was not yet receiued into their houses but stood at their doores which were shut this may seeme strange but the cause is euident the truth is there were many good things in them for they knew the gospell and liked it and professed it and were partakers of the seales of the couenant and yet they were tainted with one great sinne of lukewarmenesse which closed vp the doore of their hearts so that though they had many good things yet this one sinne kept out christ by which we see that one sinne in a man indued with many good graces keepeth out christ and barreth him from all fellowship and societie with him iudas had many notable things in him he forsooke all and preached christ and yet couetousnesse kept out christ herod had so too but incest kept the doore shut against christ it is the nature of sinne to cut a man off from all fellowship with christ and so we may haue many excellent things among vs as the word and sacraments and yet if thou be a man which hast but one sinne and nourishest it it is a barre to keepe out christ from entring if thou be giuen either to couetousnesse drunkennes fornication adulterie theft blasphemie or lying ampc that one sin whatsoeuer will keepe out christ so that he must be faine to stand and stay at the doore and so must abide as long as a man continueth in any one sinne therefore so many as haue any desire to haue fellowship with christ must haue care to cut off all sinne for though thou haue knowledge wit memorie vnderstanding and vtterance yet if thou haue but one sinne it taketh away the very ground of all fellowship with christ that is of all felicitie and happinesse in the originall it is not i stand but i haue stoode so ier i haue risen vp early and isaiah i haue stretched out my arme all the day long and here i haue risen vp early and stood here long all the day till night for so much the word of supping importeth as if he should say till supper time this sheweth christs exceeding patience in waiting for the conuersion of this people he might in iustice haue condemned them for their sinnes and haue cast them to hell and yet he standeth still all the day waiting for their conuersion till he is faine to complaine now this place serueth to shew and set foorth and giueth iust occasion to speake of god patience in waiting for the couersion amp amendement of a sinner now that which christ saith to them may he iustly say to vs he hath risen vp early and spent a long day in waiting at our doores aboue sixe and thirtie yeares therefore he may well vpbraide vs let vs then learne to know the day of our visitation for that is the day of a peoples visitation when the gospel is preached and christ standeth knocking therefore it stands vs vpon to labour to know this and regard it if we can resolue our selues of this then we practise the dutie which christ prescribeth the church of ierusalem if we do not so but shall let passe all the signes and tokens of god mercy we must looke for the like end as ierusalem had so much for the first part i stand at the doore and knocke first he vsed meanes to enter when they had barred him out marke the vnspeakeable mercie of christ they by their sinnes stopt christ from entring yet he pursueth them with mercie and offereth mercie to them that refused it and contented themselues to lie and liue in their sinnes when adam had sinned and fled from god the lord sought him out and made a couenant of grace with him so esay the lord saith he was found of them that neuer sought him they that neuer dreamed of mercie sound mercie in the parable of the lost sheep that sheep which was left as a prey to the wild beast christ sought it vp and brought it home all these places tend to one end to shew the infinite mercie of christ this is true in all churches yes in this of ours if we haue mercie we haue it before we seeke it nay when we refuse it as much as in vs lieth this should be an occasion to stirre vp our hearts to magnifie christ for his mercie we should not let passe such considerations as these but rather breake out into praise of god loue and mercie which is a bottomlesse sea quest it may be demaunded how he knockes answer the words precedent shew the sense for these words haue relation to them he said before he would spue them out then he giueth them counsell now by so sharpe a rebuke they might haue despaired therefore he shewes that by this threatning and rebuke and counsell he knockes that they might perceiue they were not tokens of wrath but of mercie so then this knocking is nothing else but the reproofe threatning and counsell vsed before he knocketh when it pleaseth him to make man see their sinne by such things here then we are to marke the state of al people which haue the ministerie of the word they haue christ among them and he standeth at the doore and knocketh at euery mans heart all threatnings of the law reproofes of sin exhortations admonitions and promises they are so many knockes of christ a great amp vnspeakeable mercie that the king of heauen and earth should do this now then doth christ knocke thus by preaching promises and threatnings ampc then we must not be so dull dead and backward but shew more zeale if any man of great place and calling knocke at your doores what stirring is there that you may receiue him as is meete then what a shame is this when christ vouchsafeth to deale thus mercifully with vs againe in that christ cometh by the ministery of the gospell to work our conuersion it serueth to admonish vs to turne with all speed for we know not how long he will stand and reach forth the hand of his ministerie to beate vpon our hearts marke further this knocking is not a light and soft kind of knocking but it goeth with crying he both knocketh and crieth it is an earnest knocking of one that would faine enter seeing then christ standing at the doore of mens hearts knocketh so earnestly to saue mens soules we againe ought to be earnest to receiue and embrace the gospell he knocketh in good earnest and we must accordingly by god grace be as earnest so much for the first token of christs loue his desire of their conuersion which he sheweth by two signes first his waiting secondly his knocking and that ioyned with crying if any man ampc now followeth the second token namely a promise of fellowship with them after their conuersion these words haue bene much abused therefore i wil stand a litle to set downe the meaning marke the forme of speech it is such as seemeth to giue a man an action in his owne conuersion whereby he comes and receiues christ so it attributes to mans will an action as if he should say i for my part stand and knocke if therefore any man heare ampc this may seeme strange that such an action should be attributed to a ma that is dead in sin but this speech is vsed for iust cause for in the conuersion of a sinner there be three agent first the holy ghost secondly the word thirdly mans will the principal agent and worker is the holy ghost which changeth the mind and will from euill to good the will by nature willing nothing but that which is against the will of god secondly the word which is an instrument of the holy ghost for he works not now ordinarily by reuelation or speciall instinct and inspiration but when a man is reading or hearing the word and applying it to his heart then the holy ghost workes in and by the word that being the power of god to saluation fro faith to faith thirdly the wil though it be dead by nature amp can do nothing of it self yet when the holy ghost begins to moue it it moues it self and striues to be altered whe god moues it we must not think mas wil is like a peece of wax which hath no actio but only passiuely receiues and impression but the will being disposed moues and stirres it selfe euen as fire so soone as it is kindled it burnes and as soone as it burnes is fire so when god hath once giuen grace the will moueth the mind seeth and acknowledgeth sin and the will inclined by the holy ghost begins a strife against sin and makes a man endeuour to please god so much as he can so the will in the very first conuersion hath his action though not by nature but by grace now considering these three actions concurre in the conuersion of a sinner hence it is that actions are ascribed to sinners which are to be conuerted as here and in manie other places not that they can do any thing of themselues without christ but when they are wrought vpon by the holy ghost thus a man hath a free will in his first conuersio by grace as fire hath some effects of fire so soone as euer it is kindled therefore it is said repent and beleeue to impenitent persons not because they can do it of themselues but because when it shall please the holy ghost to worke it in their hearts by the word they can turne and vse good meanes this is the cause why the holy ghost ascribes an action to such persons when god giues grace to receiue christ then it receiueth christ when god opens the heart by that grace it is enabled to receiue christ this being the true meaning of these words let vs see how this text hath bene abused first by papists which gather hereupo that a man hath free will in his conuersion by nature that he hath and that is the faith which sets open the heart wide to receiue christ thus if you shall humble your selues and acknowledge your vnworthinesse and lay hold on christ with true faith and testifie it by feruent loue to christ and his members then shall your hearts be open indeed and you shall receiue christ thus much for the true meaning of the condition it followeth i wil sup ampc this is the promise it self namely a mutual fellowship with christ this is the ground of al ioy comfort amp happines therfore it is here propounded as the principal thing and it hath two parts first i will sup with him secondly and he with me the true communion betweene christ and his members stands in these two things here is a double feast and these two containe the summe and substance of salomons book called the canticles for there christ entertaineth amp feasteth the church and the church feasteth him for the first i will sup with him how cant end come my wel beloued and eate of the delicate things and pleasant fruites there you may see how euery christian soule conuerted makes christ a feast to wit with the fruites of true repentance psalm the broken and contrite heart that is a most worthie part of the feast and a sacrifice acceptable to god secondly a beleeuing heart for without saith it is vnpossible to please god heb and when we giue vp our body and soules a liuing sacrifice rom bring broken beleeuing and obedient harts these are the dishes and delicates wherewith christ is fed wherein he delights and he with me we must also be feasted by christ for christ comes not for this end to be entertained but to entertaine the feast which christ makes is his own bodie and bloud in the administration of his supper his bodie is true meate and his bloud is true drinke and the vessels in which it is serued out are the seales of the word and the guests are penitent sinners which haue broken hearts which hunger and thirst after christ now from this feast ariseth righteousnesse peace of conscience and ioy in the holy ghost rom all ioy that heart can thinke comes by this feast now seeing christ makes these promises as a principall token of his loue we must make some vse of them we must renounce all our carnal vanities and earthly delights and giue our selues no more to surfetting and drunkennesse and sumptuous banquetting here is a better kind of feasting therefore turne your eyes from those lift vp your hearts and haue care to entertaine christ feast him with the graces that god hath giuen you and labor againe to be feasted of him feed of his bodie and bloud to life eternall labour to be acquainted with these that you may know by experience how christ feasts you and you him you know one friend how to entertaine another euerie man according to his dignitie but you should haue more care of this spirituall and mutuall entertainment betweene christ and you againe see here a notable abuse of those that come to the lord table for marke how these two go together christ feasts vs and we must feast him so that there may be an enterchange of feasting but our communicants come to the lord table and they will haue christ feast then but they will not feast him whereas we should feast him daily by faith obedience and repentance and good duties of our callings but we like churlish amp vngratefull nabals haue not one good dish to feast him withall this is our shame or if we be good guests for a day yet after that is past we haue no care to entertaine christ looke to it therefore and see that you feed christ not by your owne natural power but by your gifts of grace to him that ouercometh ampc this is the conclusion of the epistle in which note two parts first a promise secondly a precept the promise to him that ouercometh that is he that holds out keeping faith and a good conscience against all the enemy of his saluation shall sit that is haue fellowship with christ in his glorie christ doth not promise equall glorie and honor for that is not possible for anie creature because he is the head of his church but onely a participation as if he should say he shall be partaker of my glorie so farre as shall be meete and conuenient for him as appeareth by the words following but this wil some say is no great matter true the carnall heart of man may surmise so therefore he addes as i ouercame ampc this is no small glorie for like as my father did aduance me when i had ouercome so will i aduance all my members when they haue ouercome their spirituall enemy now as christ is inferiour to the father as he is mediator and yet sits with him so the members of christ may sit with him and yet be vnequall to him in glorie verse let him that hath an eare this hath bene expounded often before the memoriall of the righteous is euerlasting but the name of the wicked shall rot prou laus christo nescia finis the holy euangelist s luke in the fourth chapter of his gospell recordeth that on a time when our sauior came into the synagogue at nazareth to reade as his custome was there was deliuered to him a booke containing the prophecie of the prophet esay which after he had opened at the first he found the place where it was written in these words the spirit of the lord is vpon me because he hath annoynted me that i should preach the gospell to the poore he hath sent me that i should heale the broken in heart that i should preach deliuerance to the captiues and sight to the blind that i should set at libertie them that are bruised and to preach the acceptable yeare of the lord then after he had closed the booke and deliuered it to the minister he sate downe to preach and the eyes of all them that were in the congregation were bent vpon him then he opened his mouth and spake vnto them these words this day is this scripture fulfilled in your eares and they all gaue him testimonie that it was so in like maner may i say concerning this place of scripture which i haue read vnto you in your eyes and eares is this scripture this day fulfilled and i pray god you may all likewise beare witnesse with me that it is so the last time that i spake in this auditorie i intreated of the flourishing and prosperous estate of ierusalem which is the church of god set foorth in the psalme and therefore good order now requireth that i should speake of the decay and ouerthrow of the enemie of ierusalem which is babylon the see and church of antichrist and for that purpose principally haue i chosen this text of scripture to speake of that by the one we might be enflamed with loue of the true church of christ and by the other be moued to the hatred of that false church of antichrist now this text of scripture she is fallen she is fallen euen babylon that great citie for of the wine of the fury of her fornication she hath giuen all nation to drinke offereth me three speciall things to be considered first what babylon is secondly what is become of her and thirdly what is the cause of her heauie decay in the first part by the assistance of god i shall plainely shew and proue that babylon is rome in the second that babylon or rome by the iust iudgement of god is fallen yes she is fallen in the last the reason of this so sharpe sentence of god against her because she hath deceiued all the world with drunkennesse and whoredome within the compasse of these three propositions i will keep my selfe in all my discourse sauing that by your fauour forasmuch as this is the middle voice of three angels that speake in this chapter for a preface i will vse the voice of the first angell of whose preaching this my text is a cosequent and in the stead of a conclusion i will touch the voyce of the third angel which is a consequent of this the middle angels voice concerning the preface it shall be this in few words after that s john had described the preseruation and vnitie of the church of god in christ their head euen in the midst of the furie of antichrist vnder the figure of the lambe standing on mount sion with of his chast worshippers next he declareth that god would bring the same againe into the sight of the world by preaching of the gospell and the ouerthrow of the kingdome of antichrist wherefore he sendeth an angell flying in the midst of heauen or betweene heauen and earth bringing with him an euerlasting gospell and preaching that all man should feare god and giue glorie to his name for the time of his iudgement was at hand and that they should worship him that made heauen and earth and all things that are in them a very angelicall sermon indeed amp an euerlasting gospell is that howsoeuer the enemy charge it with noueltie that teacheth to feare god to giue glorie to his name and to worship him onely that is the creator of heauen and earth and a consequent of that gospell is this sermon of the angell she is fallen she is fallen euen babylon that great citie for wheresoeuer man are taught to feare god aright to giue all glorie to him alone and to worship none other but him that made heauen and earth and all things in them contained there must needes follow a great fal and ouerthrow of babylon and babylonicall religion which teacheth the contrarie wherefore if we loue the peace of ierusalem to the ouerthrow of this her great aduersarie let vs imbrace this euerlasting gospell that we feare god glorifie god and worship god alone againe if we hate babylon with a perfect hatred as we ought to do and therefore would seeke her vtter ruine and decay let vs procure that this gospell may be preached that man may learn to feare honour and serue god onely and then vndoubtedly babylon shall fall she shall fall i say she can stand no longer let this suffice therefore for a preface now haue we to cosider what babylon is i haue vndertaken to proue that babylon here spoken of is rome but first i must admonish you how i vnderstand rome and that is not onely for a certaine place in italy compassed about with walles and furnished with buildings as other cities are but for that authoritie gouernment and preheminence which is challenged by meanes of that citie or for the romaine empire which is claimed by prerogatiue of the same citie and so is babylon taken in the scripture and namely in this prophecie for in the eleuenth chapter of this reuelation the same great citie is called also sodoma and aegyptus where our lord was crucified sodoma for the great abhomination and filthinesse therein maintained and aegyptus because it keepeth the people of god in miserable bondage and slauerie as egypt vnder pharao did of old whereby it is manifest that the great citie is to be taken for that tyrannie gouernment and preheminence as i said which is challenged in the right of that great citie and so is the regiment and gouernance of the romaine antichrist depending vpon the prerogatiue of his see which is rome now if any will contend that babylon must be taken in the proper sense for a citie in chaldea onely as though we should looke for the see of antichrist out of the east as the papists for thirty or fortie yeares ago deuised a fable that was renewed also in queene maries dayes of a monstrous child which should be borne at babylon which they would haue man suppose to be antichrist he may be flatly conuicted of great ignorance whe the angell in the seuenteenth chapter of this prophecie testifieth that her name is babylon in a mysterie as in the eleuenth chapter that she is spiritually called sodoma and aegyptus not in respect of situation of the place but in similitude and likenesse of conditions wherefore it remaineth that according to my promise i proue babylon here mentioned to be rome the greatest controuersie that this day troubleth the world is where the true church of god should be the papists making great bragges that it is on their side amp we affirming that it is on our side this controuersie will soone be cut off and brought to an end if it may be shewed that babylon is rome for then cannot rome be the church of christ but the church of antichrist and therefore it standeth me vpon to bring very good and substantiall proofes to maintaine this my assertion that babylon is rome but what proofes may be counted sufficient is not the authoritie of holy scriptures and the testimonie of auncient doctors of the church good and substantiall proofes therfore if authoritie of scriptures be a good and substantiall proofe ye shall haue scriptures if consent of auncient writers in the same sentence be of any value you shall haue plentie and first beginning with scriptures i will not alledge such places as be hard and darke to vnderstand but such as be plaine euident and manifest and can receiue no other interpretation to satisfie the iudgement of any reasonable man i omit therefore so many figures as in this reuelation do not very obscurely signifie but euen directly point at and paint out that antichristian church for although they do so aptly and fitly agree therto as a man might easily iudge they were made euen for the same purpose yet because they might be wrested to some other meaning if manifest places did not withstand i will leaue all aduantage that i might take of them and hold me onely at this time to those plaine and euident demonstrations which with no equitie nor conscience can admit any other interpretation onely i will here note that forasmuch as all figures types and colours contained in this booke may so conueniently be applied to rome as though they had bene properly appointed to describe her as they were indeed it is great preiudice against rome although no plainer proofes might be brought but when so plaine arguments are brought foorth that without too much impudencie cannot be auoided and all other figures and darke speeches agree accordingly it is a manifest coniunction that rome is none other but this babylon but to begin with these plaine places as i haue promised the first shall be out of the eleuenth chapter of this reuelation the place before alleaged where it is declared that god in all times yes in the greatest persecution would maintaine his church and reserue at the least two witnesses which should testifie of his truth in spite of antichrist and his adherents which although the monstrous beast that ariseth out of the bottomelesse pit should murther and slay yet god should restore them to life again continually stirring vp a sufficient number to beare witnesse of his name and doctrine in that chapter i say is contained that when the beast had murthered them he should envy them the honour of buriall and so their body should lye in the streete or market place of that great citie which is spiritually called sodoma and aegyptus where our lord was crucified declaring thereby that as rome had slaine and crucified the head so should rome persecute the members and in the same citie where their lord was murthered the servant should be persecuted but here a man would thinke that i were impudent to affirme that our sauiour christ was crucified at rome whome all the world knoweth to haue suffered death at ierusalem but you must call to remembrance that at the first i gaue warning that i did not vnderstand rome for the topographie of rome that is so much ground onely as is compassed within the walles of that citie but for the regiment gouernance and prerogatiue that is claymed by reason of that citie or monarchie whereof rome is the head and then i shall easily proue that christ was crucified at rome for by whome was he condemned was it not by pilate the deputy or lieutenant of the romain empire for what cause or crime was he adiudged to die was it not for treason pretended to be committed against the romaine empire with what kind of execution was he put to death was it not such as was vsuall by the lawes of the romaines for such hainous offences as were vniustly laid to his charge finally was not the place wherein he suffered within the circuit of the romaine empire may i not then iustly affirme that he was crucified at rome whe by the romaine iudge he was condemned for a crime against the romaine state and executed by a kind of death appointed by the romaine lawes and in a place of the romaine dominion as for the iewes they had at that time no authoritie to put any man to death as they confesse themselues when pilate bad them take him and iudge him according to their owne lawe meaning they shold decree some light punishment against him they answered it is not lawful for vs to iudge him to dye as touching the cause although they accused him of blasphemie in that he made himselfe the son of god yet could he not be condemned for that because pilate would admit no accusation but such as contained a crime against the romaine lawes and as for the death of the crosse it is manifest to be proper to the romaines for the iewes would haue stoned him if they might haue condemned him for blasphemie according to the law of moises and that the angell in that place by no meanes can vnderstand ierusalem it is manifest by these reasons first that he calleth it that great citie which tearme could neuer be spoken of ierusalem also he calleth it sodoma and aegyptus which was the sea of the monstrous beast antichrist which in other places is often called babylon whereas no man euer did imagine that ierusalem should be called sodome egypt or babylon adde hereunto that ierusalem the place where christ suffered was vtterly destroyed in s iohns time whereby it is euident that by this great citie spiritually called babylon sodoma and aegyptus is meant none other but the romaine empire which crucified the head and should also bring foorth to put any man to death and he hath deserued the monstrous beast antichrist which should torment and afflict the members which began with murther of the lord and should continue till it were destroyed in murthering of the servant and by this plaine text which cannot be wrested to any other sense this great citie of babylon where christ was crucified is proued to be rome and the authoritie rule and power of the romaine citie the second plaine and euident proofe which i will vse at this time shall be taken out of the thirteenth chapter of this reuelation where that euill shapen beast is described which is the head of the persecuting malignant church hauing seuen heads and ten hornes and is the same which afterward in the seuenteenth chapter beareth the great whore babylon the mother of all abhominations of the earth who so therefore will compare these things that are written in this booke concerning the description of that monstrous beast with those things that the prophet daniel in the seuenth chapter of his prophecie describeth of the foure beast and specially of the fourth which all man confesse to be the romaine empire except he be too much blinded with frowardnes and peruerse affection he must needes acknowledge that this beast which john painteth out is the same that daniel setteth out which containing in it the crueltie of the leopard the beare and the lion which were the former monarchy is vnlike to them all and therefore is the fourth empire which all the world acknowledgeth to be the monarchie of rome what should i speake of the number of the hornes equall in both and generally of all other parts of their description which is set foorth so like and almost with the same words both of the one and of the other that it were meere madnesse to imagine that this beast which john describeth should be any other then that daniel had so long before portraited then if the beast in daniels description doth signifie the fourth kingdome as the angell expoundeth it which no man will denie to be the romaine monarchie the same monstrous beast being here painted out in this reuelation with the same shape colours and conditions must needes signifie the romaine empire and so babylon by this reason also is proued to be rome the third argument or proofe is taken out of the seuenteenth chapter of this reuelation and the ninth verse where the angell expounding to saint john the mysterie of the beast with the seuen heades declareth in very plaine wordes that the seuen heades do signifie seuen hilles whereon the woman sitteth now seeing it is euident that the woman signifieth a great citie we must see where we can find a great citie builded vpon seuen hilles and that by the interpretation of the angell is babylon the see of antichrist and if we seeke throughout the whole world where shall we find a great citie builded vpon seuen hils but that great citie in italie which all writers poets historians cosmographers with one consent do confesse to be rome which is builded vpon seuen hilles whose names are these palatinus capitolinus auentinus exquilinus viminaelis quirinalis and caelius this is so plaine a notation of rome to be babylon builded on seuen hilles that the angell could not more plainely haue expressed rome though he had named her nay this is a more euident and certain description of rome to be the see of antichrist then if in plaine words he had said babylon is rome for it might be that some other citie then that here was meant might haue the name of rome but no other citie could haue this notation to be builded on seuen hils for constantinople was afterward called new rome but constantinople was not builded vpon seuen hilles like vnto old rome therefore this is a plaine and manifest circumlocution of rome which with no reason can receiue any other exposition for what boy going to the grammer schoole and reading in virgils georgickes this verse septem quae vna sibi muro circundedit arces that citie saith virgil which hath compassed seuen hils within her walles what boy i say in the grammer schoole doth not vnderstand this to be meant of the citie of rome although the poet in that place doth not once name rome with what face therefore will any man denie that the angell here meaneth any other citie by this periphrasis and circumlocution then rome for if any will be so froward to except that the word of hils is not taken in the proper sense but figuratiuely and metaphorically for some other thing as some would seem to interprete seuen hils in this place for seuen kingdoms he shal plainly be conuinced by these reasons first it were absurd that the angel should repeat one thing twise for in the next clause he sheweth that the seuen heads do signifie kingdoms also but specially we must remember that this is an interpretation of the angell which must either be plaine and easie to be vnderstood or it deserueth not the name of an interpretation therefore if the angell offer to expound the mysterie of the seuen heads giueth this exposition that they signifie seuen hils if hils be not taken in their proper sense to what purpose serueth this exposition for if the name of hils hath need of another exposition he had bene as good to haue left the name of heads vnexpounded and as for the interpretation of hils to signifie kings is more obscure darke and far fet then that heads should represent kings for it is more apt by metaphor to call a king an head then to cal him an hill therefore except we will say that the interpretation of the angell is vaine yes more darke then the thing that is expounded by him we must needes confesse that hils are taken in their proper sense for hils and then the citie builded vpon seuen hilles without all controuersie is the citie of rome the fourth and last proofe that i will take out of the holy scripture is the last verse of the same seuenteenth chapter which is yet a more plaine description of rome if any thing can be more plaine then that hath bene alreadie spoken for there the angell in plaine words expoundeth that the woman which s john saw which was the great whoore babylon is that great citie which hath dominion ouer the kings of the earth what brazen face is so impudent to denie that rome was that great citie which had dominion ouer the kings of the earth at that time when this was spoken or what other citie had dominion ouer the kings of the earth in s iohns time but rome who is therefore so froward and vntoward that he will not acknowledge babylon here to be plainly called rome if i should name the chiefe city of england who would not vnderstand london if i should speake of the chiefest citie of france who would not conceiue paris and when the angell named the chiefe citie of the world who could be ignorant liuing in that time or knowing the history of that time that he vnderstood it of the citie of rome which was the sea of the empire and from whence we should looke that antichrist should come according to the former prophesies for it is a shame in this place to flie vnto allegories and further expositions of this angelicall interpretation which as i said before if it be not cleare plaine and easie to be vnderstood deserueth not the name of an exposition as when one knoweth one vnknowne thing is expounded by another as much or more vnknowne it is vaine superfluous and ridiculous wherefore whom any bonds of reason will hold in they must be satisfied with the exposition of the angell that babylon is rome for seeing it was necessary for the church of god to know aswell the place where antichrist should fit as to be instructed of his craft and crueltie our sauiour christ the author of this reuelation would not suffer his congregation to be ignorant thereof but sent his angell plainely to interprete and expound the vision of the great whoore that the church being throughly admonished of her wickednesse and instructed perfectly to know her might more easily take heed of her flie from her and abhor her so that according to my promise i haue sufficiently proued by authoritie of holy scriptures this first proposition which i tooke in hand that babylon is rome but because some are of such obstinate and willfull frowardnes that nothing will satisfie them but they will still grudge and repine carpe and obiect against my interpretations of holy scriptures for the texts they cannot deny i wish them that are such if they like not these expositions which i haue brought to the defacing of antichrist and his religion that then they admit and reuerence those expositions which their owne authors bring for the maintenance of the popes authoritie and his religion of which sort are these god saith moses in genesis made two great lights the sun to rule the day and the moone to gouerne the night that is saith the famous interpreter god ordained the pope and the emperour to rule the world by the sun is meant the pope and by the moone the emperour and looke how much greater and more glorious the sun is then the moone so much greater and more glorious is the pope then the emperour and not content with this he counteth by arithmeticke how much greater the sun is in quantitie then the moone by proportion that it hath to the earth and so by many parts he concludeth that the pope is greater then the emperor but here a man might help him what by geometrie and what by arithmeticke for where as the sun is times greater then the earth and the earth times greater then the moone as is proued by mathematicall demonstration the pope should be times greater then the emperour this is one noble exposition that is set forth to aduance the dignitie of the pope and his kingdome another like to this is vpon the words of the apostles which answered vnto our sauiour christ when he commaunded him that had no sword to sell his coate and buy one signifying the great daunger that was at hand lord say they here are two swords these swords saith the glosar are the ciuill and ecclesiasticall power which remained in peter and therefore his successor the pope hath preheminence of both no doubt a worthy interpretation and that agreeth well with the text and doth the pope great worship againe s paul saith to the corinthians corinthian the spirituall man iudgeth all things and he himselfe is iudged of none this spirituall man saith the interpreter is the pope which is iudge of all the world and may not be controlled of any man no though he draw with him innumerable soules into hell fire there to be tormented with the diuell and him for euermore yet no man must be so bold as to find fault with him or to say domine quid ita facis lord why do you so is not this an handsome exposition yes i promise you euen like vnto this other statuimus vt clerici nec comam nutriant nec barbam radant we decree saith the canon of an auncient councell that the clergie shall neither weare long haire nor shaue their beards the glosar finding this canon to be so cleane cotrary vnto the custome of the popish clergie who vse to weare long haire and to shaue their beards thought he would draw it at the least if it would not come by faire meanes to maintaine the laudable custome of the popish clergie and by exposition of one word he maketh the whole canon to serue his turne therefore statuimus saith he which is we decree is to be expounded for abrogamus which is we disanul or abrogate and so the sense afterward falleth out very plaine for the popish priests thus we disanul that prists shold go without long haire or vnshauen beards a right cunning interpretation and proper for the place and such in effect are all those that serue for the maintenance of the popes authoritie and the religion of popery therefore he that is of so sharpe iudgement that he will mislike and refuse those plaine expositions which i haue brought of the places before alleaged and except against them as inforced constrained and far fetched let him like of praise magnifie and admire these interpretations which are sought to vphold and establish the popes throne and religion as rightly faithfully and truly collected atque idem iungat vulpes amp mulgeat hireos and by as good reason let him ioyne for his plough not oxes but foxes and milke for his paile not she goates but he goates as the poet saith now that i haue proued babylon to be rome by authoritie of scripture it followeth that i must shew for the same the consent of auncient doctors and as in my former probation i touched onely such places as did plainly directly and manifestly set forth my purpose so in this behalf i wil deale with the doctors not such as they are wont to alleage against vs names indeed of great and reuerent antiquitie but workes of meere falshood and forgery bewraying their authors not to be such as they are fathered vpon but such as out of the bodie of blindnesse and superstition of much later time haue begotten them such are the decretal epistles of the old bishops of rome linus clemes anacletus ampc of which clemes writing to s iames forsooth in his second epistle chargeth him very earnestly that the pixe be cleanly kept so that there appeare no mise dong or any other filthines among the fragments of the body of christ with many other like apostolicall commaundements the impudencie of whose authors appeareth notably in this that whereas they were ignorant buzzards that could not write true latine they would ascribe their counterfeit epistles to so learned fathers as though at that time when woman and children spake latine naturally as their mother tong the bishops were so vnlearned that they did write so barbarously and were not able to vtter their mind in true latine but leauing those delicates for such as long after them i will vse no authoritie for this purpose but such as they cannot refuse but that that is auncient catholike and autenticall i will begin therefore with irenaeus one of the most auncient and autenticall writers that the church hath who in the fift booke of his treatise against all heresies speaking of the sea of antichrist vpon the last verse of the chapter of this reuelation where it is said that the number of the beast name is six hundred sixtie and sixe sheweth that the opinion of many in his time was that seeing this name which is in english the latine man or romane in the numerall greeke letters containeth this number that antichrist must be sought at rome his words are these sed amp nomen sexcentorum sexaginta sex numerorum ampc amp valde verisimile est quoniam verissimum regnum hoc habet vocabulum latini enim sunt qui nunc regnant also saith he this name lateinos containing the number of is thought to be the name of antichrist and it is very like so to be for that which most vndoubtedly is a kingdome hath that name for they be latines which now do raigne you see by this testimonie of irenaeus that this prophecie of old time was vnderstood of rome and that the mumber of the beast name is to be found in one that beareth rule at rome if this exposition or explication of the beast name had bene deuised by luther zwinglius or caluin it might haue bene suspected as a thing imagined of spite and enuy against the church of rome but when it is brought forth by so auncient a doctor which liued not many yeares after this reuelation was giuen as he himself saith that it was but a litle before his time vnder domitian the emperor which died thirteene hundred yeares before luther was borne we must needs iudge it both to be very auncient and voide of all partialitie wherefore i will passe ouer diverse other applications of that number to other names which neuerthelesse hit babylon home because they haue bene sought out of late by such as beare il wil vnto rome for i thinke this is sufficient with all reasonable man of equall iudgement to proue that this is no new opinio to seek the sea of antichrist at rome they themselues to proue their doctrine catholicke alleage authoritie of eleuen or twelue hundred yeares antiquitie behold this opinion is thirteene or foureteene hundred yeares old that antichrist should be a romaine and that the sea of his tyrannie should be at rome the second witnesse of this assertion that babylon is rome is tertullianus a very auncient writer also who in plaine words affirmeth that babylon signifieth rome in the third booke against martion which denied that christ had a true bodie wherefore tertullian vseth this reason against him that thing which hath a figure of it must be a thing of truth and so discoursing of many things figured and the figures of them cometh to these words sic amp babylon apud iohannem nostrum romana vrbis figuram portat perinde amp magna amp regno superbae amp sanctorum debellatricis that is to say euen so doth babylon in the apocalips of our s john beare the figure of the citie of rome which is altogether as great and as proud in raigne and as great a persecutor of the saints as babylon was you see therefore most clearely and plainely that tertullian with all his learning could not interprete these things that be written in this reuelation concerning babylon to be applied to any other citie then rome and he is also a witnesse voide of all partialitie or affection to either part of them that striue in our dayes for he departed neare about foureteene hundred yeares before our time why should he not then be credited in this case well next vnto him i will ioyne chrysostom in his commentarie vpon the second epistle to the thessalonians the second chapter in his fourth homilie where as s paul speaking of the manifestation of antichrist saith they knew what was the stay that he was not presently reuealed but when that stay is taken away he should be reuealed in his due time chrysostom expoundeth this stay to be the romaine empire which must giue place vnto antichrist that like as the persians came in place of the chaldeans the grecians in place of the persians and the romaines in place of the grecians euen so antichrist should inuade the empire of the romaines vacantem imperij principatum inuadet amp tentabit ad se rapere hominum amp dei imperium antichrist saith he shall inuade the vacant principalitie of the empire and shall assay to draw vnto himselfe the empires both of god and man and is it not manifest that the papacie grew and tooke increase by the decay of the empire and at the fall of the monarchie chalenged full possession of all dominion both spirituall and temporall of the same iudgement is s ierome writing vpon the same place of paul vnto algasia in the eleuenth question whose words are these nec vult apert dicere romanum imperium destruendum quod ipsi qui imperant aeternum putant vnde secundum apocalypsim iohannis in fronte purpuratae meretricis scriptum est nomen blasphemiae id est romae aeternae ampc that is neither will he openly say that the romane empire shold be destroyed which they that gouerne it thinke to be euerlasting wherefore according to the reuelation of saint john in the forehead of the purple whoore there is written a name of blasphemie which is rome euerlasting lo here another witnesse of good antiquitie and sufficient credite which not onely agreeth plainely with chrysostom that antichrist should take possession of the romaine empire when it should be decayed in the emperours but also most plainely agreeing with tertullian calleth that babylonicall strumpet which is described in the seuenteenth chapter of this apocalypse that purple whoore of rome and the name of blasphemie to be rome euerlasting as though he had heard the pope brag of the eternitie of his sea which he saith is the rocke against which the gates of hell cannot preuaile but he is foully beguiled for rome the sea of his popedome is by saint ieromes iudgement that babylom of whom the angell preached that howsoeuer she boasts of her eternity she is fallen she is fallen euen babylon that great city and neuer shal rise againe they crie out against vs that we raile and speake contumeliously of the holy sea of the pope when we cal rome the whore of babylon but when the old doctors to whose iudgement they themselues appeale from the authoritie of the scriptures feare not so plainely in their writings to paint out the babylonicall strumpet in her right colours and in flat words to say she is rome the mother of all abhomination and the sea of antichrist why should we be blamed for saying as we are taught by them and especially of those man that make so great vaunts that the iudgement of the fathers is altogether on their side by whom they offer to be tried when they dare not abide the iudgment of the scriptures againe consider i pray you if the old doctors before antichrist were openly reuealed did vnderstand by the scriptures that he should sit at rome what thinke you would they haue said and written if they had liued in these daies and knowne and seene all that was prophesied to be fulfilled in him with what confidence suppose ye would they haue inueyed against him with how open mouthes would they haue cried out vpon him at least wise do you not thinke in your conscience that when they had considered the authoritie of the pope and his wholesome doctrine they would haue changed their minds and recanted their writings against rome and repented that euer they had called her the purple whoore of babylon seeing she is the holy mother church of rome the sea of the most holy father the pope the head of the same church i must needs say thus much in your behalfe ye papists as ill as i loue you that if ierome tertullian and the rest of the doctors did so account of rome as you affirme of them they were much too blame to defame her with such odious names as to call her the whoore of babylon which must needs make her vehemently suspected to be the church of antichrist and not of christ for what papist in these dayes dare say that which ierom said that rome is that purple harlot babylon which s john speaketh of in the apocalypse the same ierome in his booke of comentaries of the prophecie of esay vpon the chapter writeth in this maner licet ex eo quod iuxta scriptu est id est filia babylonis non ipsam babylone quidam sed romana vrbem interpretantur quae in apocalypsi iohannis amp epistle petri babylo specialiter appellatur ampc that is to say for as much as the seuentie interpreters write not the daughter babylon but the daughter of babylon some do interpret thereof not babylon in caldea but the citie of rome which in the reuelation of s john and the epistle of peter is specially called babylon note that ierome in this place accounted rome to be babylon the younger daughter of babylon the elder and secondly that this was not his opinion onely but the consent of many other in his time and namely of such as vsed to interpret the prophet esay thirdly and especially consider that he affirmeth rome in the apocalypse to be especially called babylon so that babylon in the apocalypse by his iudgement can be vnderstood for nothing else but rome because rome is there specially figured by babylon what meaneth ierome so often to beate in this naile that babylon is rome if it had slipped out of his pen but once he might haue bene pardoned for his ouersight but when he hath neuer done writing that rome is babylon why should we account him any longer for a catholike for in his preface vnto the booke of didimus de spiritu sancto which he translated out of greeke into latine writing to paulinianus he vttereth these words cm in babylone versarer amp purpuratae meretricis essem colonus amp iure quiritum viuerem ampc of late saith he when i was in babylon and was an inhabitant of the purple harlot and liued after the lawes of the romaines i thought to intreat somwhat of the holy ghost what needed ierome in this place so odiously and contumeliously to call rome by the name of babylon but that he could neuer consider rome otherwise but to be the see appointed for antichrist for in other places where he interpreteth the scriptures and prophecies concerning antichrist we may lesse maruell if he interpret babylon for rome because no reason could leade him to expound it otherwise but here talking pleasantly with his friend what necessitie compelled him to vse such descriptions of rome but that this perswasion was so deepely grauen in his mind that babylon is rome that neither in earnest nor iest he could forget it but is alwaies harping vpon it as though he thought scorne to call rome by any other name then that he had learned in the scriptures to be babylon and the purple harlot for in like maner writing to marcella a vertuous gentlewoman of rome whome he allured to forsake rome and to dwell neare vnto him in bethelem one speciall reason that he vseth to perswade her is this that as bethelem whither he wold haue her to repaire is situate in the holy land and the place consecrated to the birth of christ so rome where she desired to remaine was the babylonicall harlot according to the reuelation of s john appointed for the birth of antichrist which there should arise and exercise his tyrannie and from thence should deceiue the whole world with his wicked wiles but who so will reade the workes of ierome may find yet more places in which he is bold to call rome babylon the very see of antichrist whereby it is apparant that it is no new or strange matter to seeke antichrist at rome when such old doctors of the church so commonly in commentaries epistles and other writings do teach vs that rome is babylon and the scripture affirmeth that babylon is the see of antichrist but let vs leaue s ierome and see what other say of the same matter s ambrose writing a commentarie vpon the reuelation of s john is of the same iudgement of the authoritie of the worke i wil moue no question at this time seeing it is commended to vs by cuthbert tonstall late bishop of duresme who found it in an old librarie and first set it in print vnder the name of that great s ambrose and is willing that man should so thinke of it it is good authoritie i say against the papists being commended by so catholike a prelate and because they are wont to receiue whatsoeuer cometh vnder the name of an old doctor though it be neuer so vnlike his writing and crie out vpon vs for reiecting at our pleasure the workes of auncient doctors that make against our doctrine as though we reiected any without cause or they refused none for any cause whereas pigius their great patron blushed not to reiect the report of two generall councels the fift and sixt of constantinople which are commended to vs by publike faith of the church of constantinople because in the one pope honorius is condemned and accursed for an heretike and in neither of both the popes legates could haue the highest place according to the request of their ambitious maister but as for this ambrose if he were not ambrose of millaine yet is it apparant by the stile that he was some auncient writer of the latine church and he throughout this prophecie interpreteth babylon to be rome and antichrist to be sought no where but at rome primasius also a very auncient writer who likewise commenteth vpon the apocalypse expoundeth these prophecies of antichrist to be fulfilled in the romaine empire and of the citie of rome s augustine in his learned worke de ciuitate dei not once or twice but oftentimes is bold to call rome babylon and babylon rome as in his sixteenth booke and seuenth chapter he calleth rome another babylon in the west and in his eighth booke and second chapter he calleth babylon of caldea the first rome and rome of italie the second babylon willing man to consider that in the beginning of the citie of god which was the church in abrahams time the first rome that was easterne babylon her enemie was builded in caldea and about the same time that the first babylon was destroyed lest the citie of god should lacke her enemie the second babylon which is rome in italie was erected it is a strange matter that the same citie which is the professed enemie of the citie of god should be the mother of all religion and the very citie of god it selfe o augustine thou wast not well aduised to make the citie of rome enemie to the citie of god that rome shold be the same to the church of god that babylon of old was to ierusalem the same augustine in the chapter of the booke calleth rome another babylon and daughter of the first babylon and in the chapter he calleth rome westerne babylon by these amp other testimonies of old writers that might be brought but for tediousnesse i suppose it is sufficiently proued that babylon in this my text spoken of is rome and that we should not seek antichrist to proceed from any other place then from rome but what need i trouble my selfe to seeke further testimoniall for confirmation of this matter that babylon is rome then of the papists themselues which affirme that s peter in his epistle where he sendeth salutations fro the church gathered in babylon by babylon vnderstandeth rome and they learne it of ieronime which in the life of s marke doth so expound it so greedie they are to find a place in scripture where peter should be said to haue bene at rome that they are content to acknowledge babylon in the scripture to be vnderstood of rome and thus i haue performed i trust sufficiently that which i tooke in hand to proue both by the authoritie of holy scripture in plaine and manifest texts and by consent of many auncient writers yes by the confession of the papists theselues that babylon in the scripture is taken for rome and thus much for the first part in which because i haue bene ouer long i will be shorter in that which remaineth in the second part i promised to declare how babylon which is rome is fallen according to the prophecie of this angell she is fallen saith the angell she is fallen he repeateth the word of falling for two causes first to declare the certainty of her decay that howsoeuer she seemed to flourish amp triumph as though she should neuer haue fallen or come to ruine yet god for her wickednesse most righteously and for the comfort of his church most mercifully had decreed vndoubtedly that she should fall when that time was once come which in his most wise and well ordered counsell was appointed for her destruction secondly he repeateth twice that she is fallen to shew that she should haue an vnrecouerable fall she should not fall as other cities which haue risen againe but she should fall without all hope of recouerie neuer to be restored againe therefore in the eighteenth chapter a mightie angell taketh vp a great mil stone and throweth it into the sea saying with such violence shall babylon that great citie be throwne downe and neuer be seene any more so that as it is impossible for a great milstone throwne with great force by a mightie angell into the bottome of the sea to rise vp againe and swim aboue the water so impossible is it that babylon when she is at the lowest of her fall should euer be set vp againe and in the nineteenth chapter it is said that the smoake of her burning ascended vp for euer and euer also of her vtter desolation descriptions are made in the eighteenth chapter where it is said that babylon is made a dwelling place of diuels a cage of vncleane birds according to the prophecie of esay concerning old babylon that zyim amp ohym which be sprights and goblins shall walke in her pallaces scrichowles and ostriges shall crie in her houses apes and satyres shall daunce in her beautifull buildings no voice of man shall be heard in her no sound of a mill shall be heard no light of a candle shall be seene but perpetuall solitude and sorow shall dwell there for euermore therefore saith the angell she is fallen she is fallen that is she is destroyed and neuer shall be repaired but if we will better vnderstand how she is fallen we must consider more distinctly wherein she is fallen first in wealth and riches she hath sustained a great fall consider how many kingdomes and states of the world haue renounced her obedience and all those haue withdrawne great rents reuenues and commodity that in times past were addicted to the maintenance of babylon the church of rome a great fall without peraduenture and that will neuer be recouered remember so many abbeyes monasteries nunneries frieries hospitals chauntries churches and chappels now ouerthrowne and made euen with the ground all lands iewels ornaments and great treasures that belonged vnto them cleane taken away fro them and you will confesse with me that rome in riches hath a great fall yes if you would see with your eyes a manifest example of god iudgement against babylon behold those euill fauoured ruines and heapes of monasteries that were sometimes gorgeous and sumptuous buildings the same end remaineth all that pompe and pride of babylon not yet altogether beaten downe but euen now in falling for the mouth of the lord hath spoken it and his immutable counsell hath decreed it and he hath sent an angell to proclaime it some wish perchance that monasteries had stood still and bene conuerted to better vses but vndoubtedly the prouidence of god so ordered all things that his curse which was vpon them might be executed and the prophecies that were concerning them might be fulfilled that they might be a monument of his wrath vnto all the posteritie the beginning of the fall of babylon and an example of the destruction of all the rest that should follow soone after who would euer haue thought that so great riches treasures and reuenues should so suddenly be ouerthrowne destroyed and come to nothing therefore it is manifest that the wealth and worldly substance whereby the pride voluptuousnesse and intemperance of ryotous rome was maintained and growne to an intollerable excesse is greatly diminished sore decayed and hath a foule fall and shortly shall haue a finall fall well babylon is not fallen onely in wealth and riches but also in power and authoritie for the kings of the earth which sometimes were subiect to that monstrous beast haue now shaken off the yoke of her seruitude and withdrawne the obedience of all their subiects from her yes the most part of the ten hornes which sometime gaue ouer their power and authoritie vnto the beast which were all the kings and potentates that acknowledged the pope for their supreme head and soueraigne lord do now hate and abhorre the harlot of rome and shall make her desolate by withdrawing their subiects from her obedience and naked by spoiling her of her treasures and shall eate her flesh for pure hatred and burne her with fire for great is the lord which iudgeth her so that she which before at her pleasure might commaund all princes to begin war to cease from war to defend her quarrels to annoy her enemy now is glad to flat a few seduced princes to take her part that she be not vtterly forsaken of all man or else to practise by treason and trecherie suborning rogues and vagabonds to stirre vp tumults among the rude people to trouble godly estates and commonwealths that despise her dominion but without all hope euer to recouer her auncient tyrannie her thunderbolts of excommunication which were sometime terrible to all man are now feared of no man what thogh she retaine her proud and presumptuous stomacke and will do while her breath lasteth to pronounce sentence of depriuation against princes that abhorre her wickednesse her impudent arrogancie is not so much detested of many as laughed to scorn of all her proctors and priuie practisers though they chaunge themselues like proteus into neuer so vnlikely shapes are espied in euery corner for god himselfe reuealeth their pretences and will not suffer her to preuaile any longer so that in power and authoritie babylon is fallen and falleth daily more and more into vtter contempt with all man vntill she be vtterly cosumed and brought to nothing which will not be long before it come to passe for this sentence that god hath pronounced against her and begun also to execute cannot be chaunged or much longer deferred but especially and chiefly babylon is fallen in credite of her doctrine for besides so many princes and estates of christendom that by publike authoritie haue receiued the gospell and vtterly abolished all babylonicall doctrine euen in the midst of her tyrannie and persecution great multitudes daily are lightened with the bright beames of the gospell that for all inquisitions imprisonments exquisite torments and cruell burnings they neuer a whit diminish but rather increase as god hath prouided that the bloud of the martyrs should be the seed of the church and they are more then obstinate if they do not acknowledge that this matter is gouerned from god aboue for if it had bene of man it must needes haue decayed before this time and haue come to nought as gamaliel said of the doctrine of the apostles therefore in fighting against it they shew theselues but after the maner of the old gyants to make war against god or as it is contained in this prophecie that antichrist should gather together the princes of the earth to make battell against him that sitteth vpon the white horse whose name is the word of god but all to their vtter confusion and destruction for the word of god must conquer and preuaile in the last age and antichrist must be consumed by the spirit of the mouth of christ which is his holy word and vtterly abolished by the glorious brightnesse of his coming to iudgement as s paule testifieth in the second chapter of the second epistle to the thessalonians therfore it is vaine that they seeke to vnderprop the doctrine of babylon by crueltie and tyrannie for all will not serue seeing the time of her final fall approcheth and now already our sauiour christ with the spirit of his mouth hath wasted and consumed a great part of that credit amp estimation in which the doctrine of babylon of long time hath triumphed and it is our parts to pray that her credit may dayly more and more decrease that the kingdom of christ may be perfectly established amongst vs and the kingdom of antichrist overthrowne euen from the foundations that no superfluous relicks of babylonical religion may remain where the church of christ is in building but that the doctrin of babylo may fal altogether thus i haue declared that baylon in wealth and substance in power and authoritie in credit amp estimation of her doctrine is falne and that without hope of recouery for her credit is cracked not onely amongst her enemy the protestant but euen amongst her best friends and greatest arch papists for i suppose there is none in the world so blind so superstitious so deuoutly addict in all points of popish idolatry and superstition as they were or yeares past although they close their eyes neuer so obstinatly against the light of god word yet some effect of the beames of force wil pierce euen through their eye lids and that they theselues cannot dissemble although they would neuer so faine but that they haue bene deceiued with grosse errors and shameful superstitions their pardons their pilgrimages their legends who is now so blind that seeth not how the world hath bin seduced by them and the simplicitie of the people abused to satisfie their vnsatiable couetousnesse as for the greatest patrons of popery that be learned they cannot denie but that great errors haue bene receiued and taught for truth yes the pope himselfe hath acknowledged that many errours haue crept into the church yes euen into the masse but the reformation of them pertaineth to him alone and the generall councell but what hope of reformatio is to be looked for at their hands let it be seene in the decrees of the last councell of trent what litle mise those great mountaines in so many yeares trauell haue brought foorth in fortie or fiftie yeares consultation two great matters reformed one for pardoners not to be common pedlers another for the communion in both kinds to those that desire it so they confesse it were as good in one kind and agree with them in all other points of popery yet all was not well they confesse by their correction and as for the greatest pillars and proctors they haue if they be pressed neare acknowledge a great deale more as one that landed lately at yarmouth before witnesse of good credit testified that if he might be satisfied in two points concerning the popes supremacie and the reall presence for other matters he would not greatly striue so that i will conclude that babylon is fallen in riches in power in credit of doctrine not onely with protestant but euen with papists themselues but now i know what will be obiected against me that i haue trauelled all in vaine to proue that babylon is fallen and that babylon is rome and that i haue abused the texts of scripture and sentences of old doctors to proue the same for whatsoeuer is contained either in the scripture or in the writings of the auncient doctors to proue that babylon is rome is to be vnderstood of rome vnder the heathen emperours and not vnder the popes and that all this while i haue wrested the scriptures and enforced the doctors to affirme that which they neuer thought of indeed i will confesse that some prophesies contained in this reuelation were fulfilled in the heathen emperours and that the heathen empire was an introduction vnto antichrist but that antichrist the great enemie of the church of christ and which is principally called antichrist could not be any of the heathen monarchie i will make it manifest by plaine demonstrations and first i will retaine this principle sufficiently proued before that rome is the see of antichrist and that by authoritie of scriptures and consent of auncient writers we can seeke him no where but in the romaine empire and now the controuersie resteth in this whether the heathen emperors or the pope be he first s paul in the second chapter of the second epistle to the thessalonians speaking purposely of antichrist saith expresly that he shall sit in the temple of god which is the church of christ but it is manifest that the heathen emperours did not sit in the church of god therefore the heathen emperour is not this antichrist and by the same reason it is manifest that muhammad is not that especiall antichrist because he sitteth without the temple of god as there be diverse that would haue these things to be vnderstood of muhammad or ottomanus but it is as cleare as the sun at noone dayes for as much as neither the heathen emperors nor muhammad nor ottomanus sitteth in the temple or church of god that none of them is that great antichrist of whom the prophesies of the scripture are to be expounded and whereas some of them interprete the abhomination of desolation where of christ speaketh to be meant of antichrist or at leastwise to be a signe of him that cannot be vnderstood of the heathen emperours or any other that is without the church for that standeth in the holy place which is the temple and signifieth the church now the pope sitteth in the midst of the temple of god and boasteth himself to be god chalenging to himselfe such authoritie as is proper only to god and vsurping such honour as is peculiar onely to god therfore not in the heathen emperors but in the popes is this prophesie accomplished another reason to proue that antichrist which in this reuelation is foreshewed to come into the world cannot be vnderstood to be the heathen emperours is taken out of the seuenteenth chapter of the same booke for there the angell interpreting to s john the mysterie of the beast that beareth the harlot which hath seuen heads signifying seuen hilles he declareth also that they signifie seuen kings or principall estates or formes of regiment for so the name of king is often taken in the prophets and specially in daniel at which prophesie s john borroweth many phrases of these seuen heads fiue he saith were fallen the sixt was then presently in authority and the seuenth was not yet come which seuenth was the monstrous beast antichrist that was both the seuenth and the eight now it is euident that this could not be vnderstood of the heathen emperours for nero the first persecuting paynim was come and gone and domitian another persecutor by whose tyrannie s john was banished into the ile of pathmos where he saw and receiued this reuelation was then in authoritie so that of the monarchie or tyrannie of heathen emperours this could not be vnderstood and of the christian emperours no man will expound it so that it must needs be turned ouer to the pope for it can rest in no place else and being referred vnto him all the rest haue a very apt exposition for the citie of rome and the dominions thereof hath had seuen principall states or formes of regiment the first state of kings the second of consuls the third of decemviri the fourth of dictators the fift of triumviri the sixt of caesars or emperors and the seuenth of popes now fiue of these states or formes of regiment were fallen and abolished in saint iohns time the sixt which was the emperours in his time was in place and the seuenth which is the popes was not yet come which was the very beast it selfe the romaine empire reuiued and raised vp from the bottomlesse pit of hell into the vsurped tyrannie of the pope and this is that beast that sometimes was of wonderfull great power and glory in the dayes of augustus and some other of his successors but then much decayed as if it had not bene although in some sort it were but should be restored in the vsurped authoritie of the pope that claimeth all the world to be his diocesse which power commeth not from god but from the prince of pride out of the bottomlesse pit but chiefly let vs consider that the beast although he be but one yet in the account he standeth for two for he is that seuenth head and the eight also and remember that the pope challengeth double authoritie namely the power of both the swords the spirituall and temporall so that in this exposition all things agree most aptly againe it is manifest in the scriptures that antichrist should deceiue the world with false doctrine vnder pretence and colour of true religion and therefore so often times the scripture warneth man that they be not seduced by him which were needles if any ope professed enemy of christ shold be that antichrist for there is no likelihood that an heathen man a iew or a turk should deceiue any multitude of true christians but he that vnder the pretence of the name of christ seeketh most of all to deface the honour of christ he is a subtle aduersarie and the very spirit of antichrist as s john also in his epistle doth testifie for in the second chapter speaking of those antichrists which were the fore runners of the great antichrist he sheweth that they went out from the church and in the fourth chapter he calleth them false prophets and teacheth man how to know the spirit of antichrist he that denieth iesus to be christ he that denieth that iesus christ is come in the flesh that is he that derogateth any thing from the honour of iesus to be christ and in his flesh to haue performed the ful worke of mans redemption as the pope doth most blasphemously he is antichrist and who so teacheth any such doctrine speaketh by the spirit of antichrist for the testimony of iesus is the spirit of prophesie seeing therfore that s john accounteth antichrist for one that is gone from the church amp for a false prophet it is cleare that antichrist is no heathe emperor which was neuer of the church nor yet a false prophet that tooke vpon him to teach in the church the same may be said of muhammad who neuer professed himselfe to be a christian nor yet a prophet in the church of christ pretending to vphold the religion of christ but an open enemie of the gospel amp of our sauior christ altogether without the church by these arguments i doubt not but all man may see that seeing babylon is rome and that the head of babylon is antichrist that he cannot be any of the heathen emperours but euen the pope himselfe and therefore i conclude according to my text that rome is fallen if babylon be fallen now remaineth the last part that i promised to intreate of namely the cause of god so seuere iudgment against babylon that he hath decreed her vtter ouerthrow and destruction which the angel comprehendeth in these words because she hath made all nation drunke with the wine of the furie of her fornication that is she hath deceiued all the world with false doctrine which he compareth vnto two kinds of vices whereby man are so deceiued that they loose all their right iudgement drunkennesse and fornication for as these two vices do allure man to commit them by coueting of vaine delectation that is in the euen so babylon hath inticed all man like another circe to drink of the cup of her delectable errours and to commit most filthy fornication with her idolatrous religio for of al other religions to the carnal man none is so pleasant as popery is in which be so many kinds of satisfaction to be obtained both in this life and after man be dead that there is no greater securitie for an hypocrite to sleepe in the in the faire promises of popery and that causeth so many willingly to embrace it and so loth to depart fro it because they would still continue without checke of true doctrine which calleth man to repentance amp amendment of life or else threatneth eternall damnation for howsoeuer it pleaseth them to charge the doctrine of the gospell with cause of securitie it may easily be seene by comparison of it with the doctrine of popery whether is cause of securitie that which teacheth no satisfaction but one for them that be penitent in this life or theirs that hath so many wayes to merit rewards and to satisfie for sinnes not only while man liue in the world but also for them that are already gone out of it and there is no wine so sweet to the tast of a carnall man as that which maketh him drunke with opinion of his owne righteousnesse as it is the nature of strong wine to make very cowards thinke themselues to be valiant champions and such is the cup of popish doctrine containing merits and satisfactions againe when we consider that antichrist should make man drunke with his erronious doctrine we maruell lesse how man could be so blinded and infatuate that they could not see and perceiue such grosse errors and manifest vntruths as are in popery for as they that are ouercome with the strength of wine haue lost the right vse both of their wit and of their senses euen so they that are drunke with the hereticall doctrine of popery do grope in the cleare light of the sun and see not their owne deformitie though all the world beside crie out of them in like maner they that be ouercome with the vnhonest loue of harlots they haue their reason so imprisoned in corrupt affection and foolish fantasie that they are at libertie neither to see their owne folly nor to admit any wise and godly counsell so it fareth with those that the babylonical circe the church of rome hath allured by her inchauntments to commit spirituall fornination with her they cannot abide to heare the voice of them that call them out of that damnable estate so highly they please themselues in their owne misery as if they were in case of perfect felicitie this is the effect of their drunkennesse this is the effect of their fornication and this is the iust iudgement of god that they which haue shut vp their eares from hearing the truth should be deceiued with strong delusions that they might beleeue lies furthermore by the names of these vices the angell comprehendeth all other vices that follow drunkennesse and incontinencie for these crimes go not vnaccompanied for where either of them is commonly both will be and they haue either of them and both together their traine to waite vpon them and all these we see to haue ouerflowed in rome the westerne babylon as she her selfe though she haue a brazen forehead and be past all shame cannot denie altogether and because of these so great and hainous inormities the iust sentence of god pronounced here by the angell is come vpon her that she is now in her fall and decay as she was once in her ruffe and glorie but this especially is to be noted that the angell here saith that she should deceiue all nation with the furie of her fornication for this is the great vniuersalitie that they make so great bragges of and would haue it to be a certaine note and marke of the catholicke church to be vniuersall behold the angell sayth here in plaine words that all nation should drinke of the wine of the furie of her fornication where is then the vniuersall consent and vnitie of all nation in religion that maketh a true religion and yet vniuersalitie and vnitie be two great pillars of the church of rome and for my part i do not envy her those markes which she challengeth of vniuersalitie and vnitie although we might stand in law with her for them but let her peaceably inioy them for they may helpe to proue her to be the false church of antichrist but they cannot make her to be the true church of christ we see plainely that babylon hath here vniuersalitie and vnitie for she maketh all nation to drinke of the furious wine of her fornication but the church of christ as he himselfe sayth is a small flocke and himselfe by simeon is said to be a signe of contradiction a marke that is gaine said of most man and here also is answered one great mightie obiection wherewith they thinke to choke vs that seeing the church of christ is the spouse of christ how could it be that christ should forsake his spouse and suffer her to continue in damnable errours so many hundred yeares why christ himselfe declareth that the deceipts and errours of false prophets should be so great that if it were possible the very elect should be deceiued yes there should be such a miserable dispersion that scarce two true professors of his name should remaine together in one place and yet the holy band of vnitie should be in the head which is our sauiour christ for wheresoeuer the carcasse is thither the eagles would be gathered and saint paule in manifest words declareth that the second comming of christ should not be before there were a generall apostacie that is a departure from the true faith and religion of christ and that the son of perdition antichrist were openly shewed and in this reuelation how often is it said that antichrist should deceiue all the world all nation people and tongues and that the church of christ should be driuen into the wildernesse out of the sight of the world and there remaine a space vntill she should be brought againe to light and open knowledge of all man as it is come to passe this day god name be therefore euerlastingly praised but because i haue occupied long time i will draw to an end for by that i haue said i trust it doth sufficiently appere that god according to his righteous iudgement hath determined vtterly to ouerthrow babylon because she hath deceiued all nation with the wine of the furie of her fornication and now it resteth onely that i speake a word or two of the voice of the third angell which is a consequent of this my text and serueth very aptly for the conclusion of my sermon the third angell followed crying with a loud voyce saying if any man shall worship the beast or his image or receiue his marke en his forehead or in his hand or shall acknowledge any obedience or reuerence to him as willing to drinke of the cup of babylons fornication the same shall drinke of the wine of the furie of god wrath which is powred foorth vnmingled into the great cuppe of god anger and they shall be tormented with fire and brimstone before the lambe and his holy angels and the smoke of their torments shall ascend for euermore and they shall haue no rest day nor night from extreame torments that worship the beast or shew any reuerence vnto antichrist the effect is in few words that horrible intollerable and eternall torments remaine for all them that now especially when babylon is now discouered will haue any thing to doe with her damnable errours and pernicious doctrine for howsoeuer ignorance before her fall though it were inexcusable yet seemed to diminish the greatnesse of the crime now that her wickednesse is openly displayed no pretence can saue man from the extreamitie of god wrath if they will still obstinately continue in her heresies let vs therefore pray vnto almightie god instantly that all man in their vocation may seeke the vtter ouerthrow and destruction of babylon that princes and magistrates may according to the prophecies of them hate her with a perfect hatred and vtterly abolish whatsoeuer belongeth to her that they may reward her as she hath rewarded vs and giue her double punishment according to her workes and in the cuppe of affliction that she hath powred forth for vs they may powre forth double as much to her and looke how much she hath glorified her selfe and liued in wantonnesse which was without measure so much they may bestow vpon her of sorrow and torments that preachers and ministers of god word may plainely and without dissimulation or halting discouer her wickednesse and earnestly to vrge whatsoeuer hath yet need of perfect reformation that all subiects may continue in holy obedience first to god and then to their prince to the aduauncing of the honour and glorie of god through iesus christ to whom with the holy ghost be all honor glory power and dominon both now and euer amen

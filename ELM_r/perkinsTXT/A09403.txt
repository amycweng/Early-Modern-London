the apostle in this chapter giues sundry exhortations to many christian duties in the first verse to perseuerance in faith and true religion in the and to mutuall concord in the to a spirituall ioy in the lord in this verse he exhorteth to the vertue of equitie or moderation of minde our english translations commonly read it thus let your patient minde be knowne to all man which though it be truly and well said yet the wordes translated haue a larger and fuller signification therefore according to the nature and force of the wordes i rather chuse to read it thus let your equitie or moderation of mind be knowne ampc the wordes containe partes an exhortation let your equitie be knowne to all man an excellent reason to enforce it the lord is at hand the drift and scope of the exhortation is to perswade the phillippians and in them the whole church to the practise of equity now this equitie wherevnto the holy apostle so earnestly exhorteth is a worthy christian vertue so excellent as the carefull practise thereof is the marrow and strength of a common weale and where it is there cannot but be peace and contentment in all estates and so necessarie as without the practise of it no house familie society cittie common welth kingdome or church can stand or continue indeed a kingdome may be established by force and armes by violence and crueltie but it cannot stand or continue without this equitie and christian moderation between man and man nay ciuill society and common dealing between man and man cannot continue vnles one man yeild to an other in a word there can be no peace in families no sound nor lasting loue between man amp wife nor any comfortable quietnes where one doth not yeild to the other and one beare with an other in many things and if it be so in marriage which is the neerest coniunction and the most excellent and perfect societie which is in this world then is it much more true in all other societies of man that there can be no peace no christian neighbour hood no true frendship vnles one beare with another and one towards another do carry himselfe in an euen and moderate course seeing therefore this is so necessary and excellent a vertue i haue purposed to speake of it at large let vs then examine these two points the nature of it the kindes of it for the first christian equitie is a rare and excellent vertue whereby man vse a true meane and an equall moderation in all their affaires and dealings with man for the maintaining of iustice and preseruation of peace this i take to be the true description of the generall nature of this vertue and herein first i say it is a vertue which is conuersant about practising of a moderation in all our courses and dealings with man for we man can vse no meane nor moderation with god but if we do euill it is all to much and if we do good it is all to little againe equitie and moderation is to be performed of god towardes man and not of man towardes god for if man deale not equally towardes god the fault is theirs and not his god is not worse for it but if god dealt not moderately with man the world would not last one houre and lastly where there are no faults there is no forgiuenes where no infirmities there needes no moderation but in god there is no want no errour no imperfection but his loue his mercy and his workes of loue and mercy towardes mankind and to his church especially are most perfect therefore there needes no moderation nor forbearance towardes god but towardes man who being flesh and bloud and full of infirmitis from which regeneration it selfe doth not fully free vs do therfore stand in need of this vertue to be practised amongest them els their societie and fellowship cannot endure and further all man in this case are alike and therfore one hath good cause to beare with another the prince is flesh and bloud as well as his subiects the husband is flesh and bloud as well as the wife is the pastor is a man as his people and hearers are hence it followeth that therefore one is subiect to infirmities as well as an other and therefore i conclude that in all our courses amp dealings of man with man in this word there must be practised a christian moderation secondly i say in the description that the end of this vertue is to maintaine iustice amp to preserue peace which two are the very sinewes and strength of a christian kingdome for where we do not to other man as we would others should do to vs there is no iustice and where we will not passe by small faultes and forbeare infirmities there can be no peace such is the excellency of this vertue as it serues to maintaine two other such great and principall vertues as are euen the harte and the braine of the commonwealth namely iustice and peace but for the more exact and particular knowledge of the nature of this necessary vertue let vs descend to the particular branches and kindes of it christian equitie therefore is either publicke or priuate publicke equitie is that which is practised in publicke metings and assemblies of man as in courts of iustice assises sessions counsells parliments and such like the matter where about this publicke equitie is conuersant is the right and conuenient and the moderate and discrete execution of the lawes of man lawes of man made by lawful authoritie according to god law and for the common good are and are to be estemed bones and sinewes to hold to gether proppes and pillers to vphold the common wealth and all societies god therefore hath giuen to kings and to their lawful deputies power and autoritie not onely to commaund and execute his owne lawes commanded in his word but also to ordaine and enact other good and profitable lawes of their owne for the more particular gouernement of their people and to be helpes for the better executing of the lawes of god and also to annexe a punishment and penaltie to the said lawes which penaltie is to be according to the qualitie of the fault greater or lesse in so much that they may in many cases if the common good so require inflict euen death it selfe and further god hath giuen these goddes vpon earth a power as to make these lawes and annexe these punishments so also vpon mens defaults and breaches hath he giuen them authoritie to execute the law so made and to inflict vpon the offender the punishment annexed now because this point is of great moment in a common wealth and the true knowledge and due practise thereof is the glory and bewtie of a kingdome therefore for the better directio herein both of prince and people magistrate and people gouerned let vs enter further into the consideration thereof in the lawes of common wealthes two things are to be considered the sight whereof will giue great light to know more perfectly what this publicke equitie is these are the extremitie of the law the mittigation of the law both these are put into the hand of the magistrate by god himselfe to be ordered according to his discretion and as the circumstance requireth and of them in order the extremitie of the law is when any law of man is vrged and executed straightly and precisely according to the literall sence and strict forme of the wordes and the exactest meaning that can be made out of the wordes without any manner of relaxation at that time when there is good and conuenient cause of mittigation in regard of the person offending this point cannot well be expressed in sewer wordes the principall and most materiall clause in this discription of extremitie is in those wordes at that time when there is iust cause of mittigation in regard of the person offending for if there be no good cause of mittigation then it is not called extremitie but iustice of the law but when there is good cause why in a christian consideration of some circumstances this iustice should be mittigated and yet is not but contrariwise is extremely vrged and pressed to the furthest then it is extremitie now this extremitie of the law is in this case so farre from iustice as indeed it is flat iniustice and herein is the prouerbe true summum ius summa iniuria that is the extremitie of the law is extreme iniurie and of this doth the holy ghost meane ecclesiastes be not ouer iust that is presse not iustice to farre nor vrge it to extremely in all cases least sometimes you make the name of iustice a couer for crueltie now besides this there is a second thing in the hand of the magistrate namely the moderation relaxation or mitigation of this extremitie and that is when the proper forme of the wordes and the strictest meaning of the law is not vrged and the punishment prescribed in the law is moderated or lessened or deferred or it may be remitted vpon good and sufficient reason and in such cases as whereof the lawe speakes not directly nor the law maker did purposely aime at the ground of this mittigation is because no lawe makers beeing man can foresee or set downe all cases that may fall out therefore when the case altereth then must the discretion of the lawemaker shew it selfe and doe that which the law cannot doe this mitigation is in the hand of the magistrate as well as the extremitie nay it is a part of his dutie as well as the former and he offends as well that neglects to mitigate the extremitie when iust occasion is as he that neglects to execute the extremitie when there is neede as therefore he is no way fit to be a iudge who hath no knowledge or care to execute the lawe so he is but halfe a iudge who can doe nothing but vrge the lawe and the plaine words of the lawe and is not able also to mittigate the rigour of of the lawe when neede so requireth therefore euery magistrate is to practise this with the other and not to separate those things which god hath ioyned but now least this moderation and mittigation of mans lawes which is the practise of publike equitie should turne to the maintenance of malefactors the abolishing of lawes the despising or weakening of authoritie which in these daies little needeth we must therefore nowe remember this caution that there must be no mittigation but honest profitable and conuenient if any man aske when is it so i answer in three cases first when the mittigation stands with the lawe of nature secondly when it agreeth with the morall lawe or any part of the written word thirdly when an inferiour law is ouer ruled or countermanded by a higher lawe in these three cases the moderation of mens lawes and the mittigation of the punishment due by the extremitie of these lawes is honest and good and may and ought to be practised but if it be contrarie and not warranted by some of these then that mittigation is flatt iniustice and a manifest wrong vnto the law that the difference of these two the extremitie and mittigation may better be discerned let vs consider it in some examples it is the law of england and many other country that the theife shall die now though the word of god hath not the same punishment in plaine tearmes yet is the law good and warrantable as shall appeare in the sequell and i thinke is doubted of by none the drift of this law is to represse that common and generall sinne of the euerie a preuailing sinne as any other and so farre preuailing as the rigour of good lawes is necessarily required for the repressing of it so that this lawe was made for the cutting off of such rotten members as doe but corrupt others and of whose amendment there is no hope now suppose a young boy pinched with hunger cold and pouertie steales meate apparell and other things for releife beeing pressed to it by want and not hauing knowledge or grace to vse better meanes to put this person to death for this facte is the extremitie of the law in respect of the circumstances of the person who did it beeing a childe and of the end for which he did it to releiue his wants now the moderation in this case is when vpon these considerations that first he is not an olde nor a practised theife but young and corrigible one that beeing reformed may liue long and prooue a good member in the common wealth and secondly that his theft was not hainous but the things he stole were of small value and thirdly that he did it not vpon a malitious cruel and iniurious intent but to releiue his hunger and want the equitie or moderation i say in this case is not to inflict death for that were extremitie but to determine a punishment lesse then death yet such a one as shall be sufficient to reforme the partie from his sinne to punish the fault to terrifie others and to satisfie the law thus in this example it apeares manifestly what this moderation is and what is extremitie which is contrary to it and the same might we see in many more now hauing thus considered these two together here vpon we may see what this publicke equitie is namely nothing els but a moderation and mittigation of the extremitie of a law vpon honest and conuenient reasons and in such cases as were not directly intended in the law the obseruation and due practise of this equitie is the glorie credit and honour of all publicke assemblies as assises sessions and all courts of iustice and without the obseruation of this when need is all that they do is flat iniustice in that case for they lame and maime the lawe they fulfill but the one part of the lawe for in euery lawe there are these two thinges the extremitie in plain tearmes and the mittigation implied and these two together make the lawe perfect and the glory of the lawe standes as well in practising of mittigation as in the execution of extremitie nay sometime it standes in the mittigation and not in the extremitie insomuch as the moderation is then the equitie of the lawe and the extremitie is more iniustice and as this is the glory of the lawe so is it the glory of iudges and magistrates thus to execute the lawes and to temper them with such discretion as neither too much mittigation do abolish the law nor too much extremitie leaue no place for mittigation therefore to make an end of this point two sortes of man are here reproueable first such man as by a certain foolish kind of pittie are so carried away that would haue nothing but mercy mercy and would haue all punnishments forfaitures penalties either quite taken away and remitted or at least lessoned and moderated they would also haue the extremitie of the lawe executed on no man this is the high way to abolish lawes and consequently to pull downe authoritie and so in the end to open a dore to all confusion disorder and to all licentiousnes of life but i need not to say much herein for there are but few that offend in this kind mans nature beeing generally inclined rather to crueltie then to mercie this fault proceedeth either from a weakenes of witt and an effeminatenes of minde and then a man is vnfit to be a iudge or else from vaine glorie and a base and affected popularitie and such a man is vnworthy to be a iudge but in the second place this doctrine and the very scope of this text condemnes another sort of man which are more combersome that is to say such man as haue nothing in their mouthes but the lawe the lawe and iustice iustice in the meane time forgetting that iustice alwaies shakes hands with her sister mercie and that all lawes allowe a mittigation the causes of this euill are two the generall corruption of mans nature which is alwaies readie to deale too hardly with other man as also too mildely with themselues and partially in their owne causes and secondly for the most part such man doe gaine more by lawe then by equitie more by extremitie then by mittigation as the souldier liues better by war then by peace and as the flesh flie feedes on the wound that cannot feede on the sound flesh so these man gaine by law that which they can neuer get by equitie for equitie and moderation breede vnitie and if all man were at vnitie what should become of them but extremitie breeds variance for in reason one extremitie drawes on an other and so in mens variances they are set on worke and the more the better for them these man therefore sticke so precisely on their points and on the very tricks and trifles of the law as so the law be kept and that in the very extremitie of it they care not though equitie were troden vnder foote and that law may raigne vpon the earth and they by it they care not though mercie take her to her wings and flie to heauen these man for all their goodly shewes are the decayers of our estate and enemy to all good gouernment for though they haue nothing in their mouthes but iustice iustice and haue banished mercie yet let them know that iustice will not stay where mereie is not they are sisters and goe alwaies hand in hand they are the two pillars that vphold the throne of the prince as you cannot hold mercy where iustice is banished so cannot you keepe iustice where mercie is exiled and as mercie without iustice is foolish pitie so iustice without mercie is crueltie so that as these man haue banished mercie so within a short time they will send iustice after her and crueltie and oppression will come in their rooms which are the very ouerthrow of all estates these man when they are made practisers of the law iudges or magistrates are to learne this lesson which the holy ghost here teacheth let you equitie be knowne to all man and let all magistrates thinke it their honour to be counted mercifull iudges let them reioyce as well to shew mercie when there is cause as to execute extremitie when there is desert and let them labour for that christian wisdome and discretion wherby they may be able to discerne when mercie and mitigation should take place and when extremitie should be executed if inferiour iudges or magistrates be negligent herein then must we haue recourse to the prince the highest iudge on earth and vnder god the first fountaine of iustice and mercie whose care must be that as iustice and mercie not one of them but both together doe vphold his throne and fasten the crowne vpon his head so he likewise see them both maintained and take order that in the execution of his owne lawes there be alwaies a roome as well for mercie and mitigation as for iustice and extremitie this must he doe because his lawes cannot be as god lawes are god lawes are perfect and absolute and of such an vniuersall righteousnes as that at all times and in all places they are of equall strength and of the same equitie in all cases and therefore are to be executed without dispensation relaxation or any mitigation which cannot be offered vnto the but with iniurie and violation but mens lawes comming from their owne wits are imperfect and so in all cases they doe not hold the same equitie and therefore must needes be executed with a discreet and wise moderation this moderation is publike equitie and this publike equitie is the scope of this text and the due practise of it in the execution of mans lawes is the glorie of all christian commonwealths hitherto of the first and principall branch of publike equitie to proceede further as this publike equitie principally stands in the moderation of the laws of man so it descends more specially eue to all the publike actions of a mans life so that by the rule and direction of this equitie thus described man may know how to guide themselues in suing bondes and taking forfeitures and how man may with good conscience carrie themselues in suretyships in taking of fines in letting of leases and in all manner of mutuall bargains between man and man by vertue of this a man may see how to frame all these and such like actions in such sort as himselfe shall reape credit and gaine ynough amp his neighbour helpe and succour by him for in forfeitures of bonds forfeitures of lands or leases in suretyships in rents in fines and all other dealings of man togither there are these two things first the extremitie that is that which the law will affoard a man in that case and there is secondly the moderation of the extremitie vpon good and conuenient reasons let vs consider of them in some fewe examples a man is bound to another in an hundreth pound to pay fiftie at a day the same man not by negligence but by some necessitie breakes his day and afterwards brings the principall debt now to take the forfeiture is in this case extremitie though the law doth yeeld it and if a man stand vpon this extremitie he deales not honestly and equally but hardly and extremely with his neighbour and the law cannot free him in this case from manifest iniustice what is then the moderation in this case euen this to take thine owne and remitte the forfeiture the reason is because the cause amp groud of appointing a forfaiture was not for aduantage but only for the better securitie of the principall which seeing thou hast thou hast that which the law did inted thee againe his breach was not willfull or with purpose to hurt thee but against his will if therefore thou beest directly damnified by his missing thy day without all aequiuocation then take thy reasonable dammages out of his forfeiture if not then remitte the vvhole forfeiture and this moderation is publike equitie and without this there can be no buying nor selling borrowing nor lending between ma amp man see another example one takes a lease of thee for yeares to pay thee such a rent amp for not paiment of that rent his lease to be voide the poore man misseth his rent day now what saith the lawe his lease is forfeited but to take this aduantage is the extremitie of the lawe the moderation is to remit the same forfeiture in part or in whole as thou shalt see reason in equitie and conscience this moderation is in this ease publike equitie and without this there can be no letting of lands between man and man so for fines and rents the lawe saith thou maiest make the most of thine owne if thou stretch this law as farre as the very wordes will beare then maiest thou make such fines and rents as may grinde the faces of the poore so as no man shall liue vnder thee but thus to doe is extremitie and beyond the purpose of the lawe the moderation in this case is not to take all thou maist get but so to fine and rent thy lands as he that takes them may liue of the the reason of this mittigation is because envy and hatred may often make many man offer more for a farme then it is worth to crosse and hurt their neighbour or to get all into their owne hand here therefore though the lawe doeth yeild thee all that which a man doeth willingly offer yet must thine owne conscience be a lawe vnto thee to make thee a moderator of that extremitie let these three examples serue for many now in these and all other publike dealings between man in the world a man obserues publike equitie when he dealeth not with his neighbour according to that extremity which the strickt wordes of the lawe will beare but according to that moderation which good conscience requireth amp which the lawe it selfe in some cases doth admit by the knowledge of these two a man that hath any conscience may see howe to carrie himselfe in all these ciuill affaires in an euen vpright and equall course and warrantable not onely by the lawe of the land but euen by the law and word of god and i make this distinction of the lawe of the land and the word of god because we are to knowe this for a rule that euery extremitie which a law in the strictest acception doeth affoard is not warrantable to be vrged by the word of god and yet notwithstanding it is good conuenient and requisite that the extremitie be warranted by the lawe because in some cases it must needes be executed the lawes of man may ordaine and appoint extremities but the law of god must tell vs when to vrge them and when to moderate them so then when a man takes the extremitie he doeth that that is alwaies warrantable by the lawe but in some cases is not warrantable by god word which commandeth a mittigation when there is good reason for it but he that taketh the extremitie when there is no iust cause of mitigating it and againe doth mittigate it when there is cause his course is not onely warrantable by the lawes of man but euen by the lawes of god also for it is the dutie of euery christian man to remember in all his bargains and dealings that his manner of dealing must not onely be warranted by the lawes of the land but euen by god word also and this is to be knowne and taken for a generall rule in all this treatise and he that will duely consider the true difference of extremitie and moderation as they are here described may see how to carrie himselfe in all his dealings so as they may be warrantable both by our owne lawes and by the word of god to returne then to the matter and to end this point of publike equitie if any man shall obiect that this moderation is a wrong to the law i answer it is not for it is neither against the lawe nor altogether besides the lawe but onely beside the stricttest meaning of the lawe nay it is included in the lawe as well as the extremitie is though not in the same manner for the extremitie is warranted by the law mitigation is but tollerated the lawe alloweth extremitie but it onely admitteth a mitigation so then both extremitie and mitigation are within the lawe but it is in the hand principally of the magistrate and in some cases of other man also to discerne the seuerall circumstances when the one is to be executed amp when the other for sometime one is the iustice of the lawe and sometime the other and according as these two are iustly and wisely executed or neglected so is the iustice of the lawe executed or neglected the want of this equitie in mens publike actions is the cause of much crueltie oppression and inequalitie in dealings between man and man because extremitie is for the most part onely regarded and mitigation is banished out of all bargains and it is impossible to keepe good conscience in forfeitures of bonds and in forfeiture of lands suretiships fines rents and such kind of actions vnlesse there be due regard had to the practise of this publike equitie man therefore must consider that they are christians and liue in a christian commonwealth and they must not stand onely vpon the lawe and the aduantage that the law giues as they are man they haue a lawe of the country which may allow extremitie but as they are christians they liue vnder a law of god the eternall lawe which must iudge them at the last day the righteous lawe which no creature shall euer be able to blame of iniustice or of extremitie and man must know that god himselfe commands this equitie of one man to another but if man for the feare of god will not deale equally and moderately with them that are in their power but stand strictly vpon forfeitures and other extremities then must the godly magistrate exercise his power and by the force of his authoritie cause them to mitigate their extremitie and to put in practise that equitie which becommeth christians and let euery iudge and magistrate knowe that by the lawe of the euerlasting god he not onely may but is bound thus to doe to them who will not doe it of themselues it may be therefore good counsell to all man rather to practise this christian equitie of themselues the to be compelled to it by authoritie for euery vertue and good worke the more free and voluntarie it is the more acceptable is it to god and more commendable before man and let all man remember that whereas the strict words of mens lawes seeme to giue them leaue to vrge the extremitie yet cannot that excuse them nor free them from the danger of god law which commands them to practise christian equitie and moderation now before we make an ende of this publike equitie one point is necessarie to be handled in few words some may obiect if moderation be intended and included in our law as well as extremitie why then is extremitie onely mentioned in the law and not this mitigation which they so much doe vrge vnto vs the answer is readie the law expresseth and vrgeth the extremitie to fray man thereby from comming within the danger of the extremitie and concealeth the mitigation least it should be an encouragement to offend yet intending it as well as the extremitie and leauing it in the hand of the magistrate to put in practise when iust occasion is offered as well as the extremitie herein appeareth the great wisdome of the lawmakers our auncient forefathers who well and wisely foresaw that though mitigation be as necessarie as extremitie and oftentimes more yet because of the ill consciences of the most man and the readines of all man to offend thought it fitter to expresse the extremitie in plaine tearmes thereby to keepe ill man within the compasse of obedience and closely to leaue the mitigation to the discretion of the magistrate so then our lawegiuers concealed the mitigation and expressed it not in their laws in good pollicy and to good purpose if we therefore doe onely take the extremity we take onely one part of their intent and shew our selues vnwise and shallow witted who cannot see the wisedome which they closely concealed in wise and christian pollicie he is not worthie the name of a lawyer at least of a christian lawyer much lesse worthie the place and seat of a iudge who knoweth not this for if the law contained not both these it were vnrighteous and so no law for mitigation is for the good man and extremitie for the euill the carelesse and vnconscionable man if there were no extremitie how could the evil man be kept within compasse and how should the poore honest man liue if there were no mitigation so then it is warrantable by the word of god and good conscience that extremitie should be in force and should stand by law but so as it alwaies admit of mitigation whe neede is let therefore our conclusion be to exhort euery man into whose hands is put the execution of lawes to shew himselfe as wise in executing them as were our forefathers in the making of them that is as well to regard the mitigation which is concealed as the extremitie which is expressed so shall the lawmakers wise intent be performed publike equitie preserued and much iniustice and hard dealing preuented now in regard of this that hath beene deliuered touching publike equitie lawyer must not thinke that i haue gone beyond the compasse of my calling and encroched vpon their liberties for they are to know that the laws of man are policie but equitie is christianitie now christianitie was before there were any laws of man and therefore they must be ordered according to the rules of christianitie againe diuines must take lawyer aduise concerning extremitie and the letter of the law good reason then that lawyer take the diuines aduise touching equitie which is the intent of the law moreouer their law is but the minister of equitie but our law the word of god is the fountaine of equitie therefore the principall rules of equitie must they fetch from our law considering that law without equitie is plaine tyrannie lastly in the first christian commonwealth that euer was namely the iewes the diuines that is the priests of those daies were the onely lawyer for their positiue lawes were the iudiciall lawes giuen by god himselfe whose interpreters were the priests and leuites if therefore once the diuines had so much to doe with positiue lawes it may not nowe be thought amisse if they giue aduice out of the word of god touching the equall execution of the lawes of man and so much touching the doctrine of publike equitie grounded vpon the word of god now followeth the second kind of equitie called priuate namely that which is to be exercised between man and man in their priuate actions but ere we goe further some may demande the difference between publike and priuate actions priuate actions of man are such as are practised amongst man without any helpe of the lawe as contrariwise publike actions are such as cannot be performed but by the helpe of the lawe and the hand of the magistrate wherevpon it followeth that publike actions may be between priuate man and priuate actions between publike persons there is a publiknes and a priuatenes as i may tearme it both of man and actions a man is priuate vntill he be exalted vnto some authoritie in church or commonwealth then he is a publike person an action is priuate as long as it is begunne and handled between two man and needeth not the publike voice nor censure of the law to determine it and then it is publike for example a magistrate may haue dealing with an other man or two magistrates together if they determine it together between themselues it is a priuate action because they doe it not as they are magistrates but as they are man and so there is a priuate action between publike persons so a priuate man no magistrate may haue a trespasse a debt a forfeiture or any other action or demand against another man wherein because he cannot come to a reasonable and equall ende by priuate meanes he craues the helpe of the law and the voice of the magistrate and so here is a publike actio between priuate man now this vertue of equitie respecteth not the publiknes or priuatenes of the persons but of the actions therefore as that is publike equitie which is exercised in the determining of publike actions which come to the iudgement of the law so that is priuate equitie which is practised in the managing of priuate actions which are begun and concluded priuately between man and man and neuer come to publike hearing nor triall of the law now let vs come to search more neerely into the nature of this vertue priuate equitie is a moderate euen and equall carriage of a mans selfe in all his priuate wordes and deedes towards all other man and all their words and deedes first i say it is a moderate carriage of a mans selfe that is between both extreames neither bearing all things nor reuenging euery thing secondly i say towards all other man wherein i comprehend all man amp all sorts of man husbands wiues magistrates subiects teachers hearers masters servant parents children man woman neighbours in townes fellows in societies in seruice in labour in a word none are excepted who any way doe liue or conuerse together but of them all it is true that if there be not a moderation and a forbearance one of another there can be no peace amongst them but their liues shall be all as it were a hell vpon the earth seeing therefore the necessitie and excellencie of this vertue is such that the due practise of it is the ornament of families and societies and the comfort of a mans life in this world let vs enter into more particular consideration thereof priuate equitie hath foure degrees or principall duties first to beare with naturall infirmities secondly to interpret doubtfull things in the better part thirdly to depart from our owne right sometimes fourthly to forgiue priuate and personall wrongs of all these briefly and in order the first dutie of priuate equitie is to beare with the defects and infirmities of mens natures with whome we liue as long as they breake not out into any great inconuenience or enormitie these infirmities are manifold as for example frowardnes or morositie of nature bastines slownes of conceit dulnes of wit suspitiousnes desire of praise and such like these and many other naturall infirmities must a christian man beare and tolerate patiently in those with whome he conuerseth as with his wife his child his servant his friend his neighbour ampc and so long must he beare with them as they are kept within a meane and breake not out into extremitie of these the holy ghost speaketh prou it is the glorie of a man to passe by an infirmitie that is if he seeth in his brother weakenesses of nature which doe not arise from setled malice or cankred corruption it is a mans glorie and praise alwaies so farre to moderate himselfe as not to see them nor to take notice of them at least not to be mooued nor disquieted at them and oftentimes so litle to regard them as though they were not done to this end saith the apostle corinthian loue suffereth all things that is all things that may be borne with good conscience amp are done by them whome we loue now any thing may be borne with good conscience which is either so priuate or so small that the wrog is onely ours and no dishonour thereby ensueth to god glorie nor ill example to the church all such things loue suffereth and indeede it is the propertie of true loue to passe by many wants and the more that a christian is rooted in true loue the more infirmities will he passe by in them whome he loues he setteth no limits to himselfe how many or how long to beare but euen all that are infirmities of nature many hard words many angrie fits many needles surmises many vnkindnesses will he put vp and as it were not see them whose heart is possessed with true loue wisdome and the scare of god and thus must euery one doe that will practise christian equitie for this is a mans glorie and commendation let vs lay this doctrine neerer to our consciences by cosidering the nature of this vertue in some few examples a man hath a wife or a woman a husband in whome there is the feare of god and honest and faithfull loue but he or shee is subiect to anger or to hastines or to an austeritie in their behauiours or it may be it is not in their natures to practise those outward complemets of kindnes which others can doe with great facilitie these and such like are but weaknesses of nature in them that feare god therefore must loue couer them and beare them and oftentimes not take notice of them and the rather because he or shee that hath not such hath either the like or greater weaknesses all which if one forbeare not in another it is not possible to liue in peace and comfort but if this part of equitie were practised it is scarce credible how much it would augment the happines and adde to the comfort of them that are married againe a man hath a servant carefull and willing ynough to obay and please his master also trustie and faithfull but he is slow in his busines and doth not dispatch things appointed him to the minde of his master not so speedily not so readily nor with that facilitie as his master requireth what is to to be done in this case to see it and alwaies to checke him for it and to gall and gird him with it and euer to be casting it in his teeth and threatning him for it is the extremitie which here the apostle condemneth the equitie then in this case to bee performed is in consideration that it is not a fault of malice but of nature not of idlenesse nor carelesnesse but of a naturall weakenesse the master must gently tell him of it and priuatly and seldome and aduise him what are the best helps for nature in this case and though he see not that speedie amendment which he desireth yet is he to beare with him as long as he is trustie diligent dutifull and willing and for those so many good properties he must beare with his wants and not be too sharp either in reproouing or in correcting him for them in the the third place a man hath occasion to confer often with another man by reason that they are neighbours or speciall friends or of the same calling and course of life but one of them is hastie and soone angrie and it may be in his talke either for the matter or the manner of it he cannot but shewe his anger extremitie in this case is for a man to deale roughly with him to contradict and crosse him to denie what he saith to stand stifly to our our owne opinion amp to be angrie againe with him but on the other side christian equitie teacheth a man not to see it nor take notice of it nor to be angrie againe nor to checke him for it but to put it off by gentle words soft demaundes and other talke and to yeild to him as farre as a man may doe in good conscience without betraying of the trueth and by the way in conference hold it alwaies for a rule of christian wisedome and priuate equitie neuer to sticke stiffely to any opinion vnlesse it be in a plaine trueth and of great moment now thus doing to our brother and sparing his weaknes and continuing on our speech as though we sawe not that he was angrie hereby the conference holds on and loue is continued as afore but if contrariwise we take the aduantage of his infirmitie and display it and rub him for it if we be as short as he and stand stiffely vpon points then the conference is broken off without edification and heart burning riseth between them in stead of true loue thus we see in these examples how in a christian moderation we are to beare and to forbeare the naturall weakenesses of our brother if we purpose to liue in any comfort with them in this world yet this forbearance must be with two conditions first that these wants be wants of nature not of malice nor of old rooted setled and cankred corruption secondly if they whome wee forbeare containe theselues within conuenient bonds and doe not exceede nor breake out into any outrage or extremitie for then they are not to be forborne but to be tolde and reprooued for them and a mans dutie is not to winke at them but to take notice of them and to shewe open dislike of them but in as much as these are wants of nature as it is infirmitie in the one to shewe them so it is the glorie and praise of the other to pardon them yes it is a token of wisedome and good gouernment and a signe that a man is a louer of peace and consequently of religion and of god himselfe to passe by them the practise of this dutie maintaines peace in kingdoms country states cities colledges families and all societies of man thus much for the first dutie the secod dutie of priuate equity is to constru amp interpret mes sayings that are doubtfull in the better part if possibly it may be this is to be vnderstood of all man though they be our enemy and this must a man do if he will liue in peace in this world our nature is giuen to take man at the worst to depraue mens deeds and words amp to peruert them to the worst sense that may be and this is commonly the cause of debate and dissention in the world but the dutie of christian equitie is contrary hereunto namely to thinke the best they can of all man to construe all doubtfull actions in the better part and to make the best sense of all doubtfull speeches if we haue any probable reason to induce vs to it the apostle makes this the propertie of loue corinthian loue thinks not euill that is not onely then when there is manifest and good cause to thinke well but when it is doubtful if it may by any meanes haue a good meaning if by any means it may be well thought of loue will make a man thinke well of it amp the more specially a man loues another the more equally indifferently and christianly will he interpret all his sayings and doings the want of this dutie and the practise of the contrarie is the cause of more troubles tumults garboiles fallings out and heartburnings in kingdomes country societies and families between man and man then any one thing in the world besides dealing thus with the wordes of christ cost him his life for when christ said destroy this temple amp i will build it in three daies they interpreted it of the temple of ierusalem when as he meant of the temple of his bodie and the wrong and sinister interpretation of dauids embassy by his neighbour king hanu was the cause of that great war between two mightie kingdomes the israelites and the amonites which cost so many thousands their liues for when dauid sent embassadours to comfort him after his fathers death he and his wicked counsellers interpreted it that he sent spies and intelligencers to find out the weaknesse of the land it cannot be spoken what broiles hurliburlies and confusions in kingdomes what contentions in eommon wealthes what factions and diuisions in colledges amp societies what disquietnesse in families what vnkindnesse and falling out amongest old friends and what separation euen amongest them that should be neerest are daily in the world by reason of this sinister interpretation of mens words and deeds we therefore that doe professe our selues the children of peace must learne to make conscience of this the due practise whereof is the conseruation of peace and further in this dutie one thing more is to be remembred namely that we must not giue too sharpe a censure euen of the open and manifest euill sayings or doings of our brother we must not iudge them to be done carelesly when it may be they are done ignorantly nor deliberately when it may be they are done rashly nor presumptuously when it may be they are done vpon infirmitie nor to be done vpon hatred or malice to vs when it may be they are done for an other cause nor may we iudge an euill thing to be done for want of conscience when it may be it is done for want of heedfulnesse but alwaies we must remember to make the best we can euen of another mans infirmities and as if our brother doe well we are to acknowledge it and commend him for it so if he doe amisse we must not make it worse then it is but the world is farre too blame herein for they can extoll their owne well doing and twentie waies excuse their euill doing but as for other man they can debase their well doing and aduance their euill doing nay it is a common thing to make a badde man worse then he is and to speake of an euill action and of mens faults worse then they are yes to speake worse euen of ill man then they deserue but it is flat iniustice not onely to speake euill of that that is good but euen to make an euill thing worse then it is many cases there are wherein a man is bound to make the best he can of a bad action but to make it worse then it is there is no case wherein a man may doe it without plaine iniurie to his brother if any man replie and say i am not to spare my selfe nor excuse my owne faults but to iudge as hardly of my owne sayings and doings as they deserue why then should i not also doe so to another the answer is readie because a man knoweth not another man so well as himselfe words and deedes are knowne to other man but a mans heart is knowne to himselfe alone therefore for thy owne sayings and doings thou article also able to iudge of thine owne heart and of thy purpose and intent in so speaking and doing but of another ma thou canst say he spake or did thus or thus but his heart his purpose amp intet in so doing thou canst not iudge amp therefore thou maist not iudge so sharpely of another mans sayings and doings as of thine owne to make an ende of this point in the performance of this dutie two cautions must be remembred first that we speake not of continued courses in doing or speaking euill but of particular speeches and actions for not an action or a speech but the course of life shewes what a man is one euill speach or action may be excused but a continued course in doing or speaking euill may be by no meanes coloured or excused secondly we speake not of manifest amp publike enormities as of treasons against the prince or state for therein it may be dangerous to the prince and hurtfull to the state to haue any thing coloured concealed or excused in such cases we must set aside our dutie to our brother and remember our dutie to the head and whole bodie and better it is that one member be cut off then that the whole bodie perish but we speake of priuate euill words or deeds the euill and hurt whereof redoundeth to priuate man and in them we speake not of manifest grosse and palpable crimes wherein not only the action is plainely euill but the intent also for to excuse or conceale or to extenuate such is to make our selues accessarie to the euill of them but we speake of doubtfull words or deeds wherein either the action it selfe or at the least the intent of it may receiue a likely excuse and a probable interpretation of good and vnto these two cautions adde thus much further that the practise of this dutie for the most part ceaseth when the minister is to worke vpon the conscience of an impenitent or a presumptuous sinner for then he is not to moderate or mitigate to colour or excuse to lessen or extenuate his sinnes but to speake of sinne as it deserues and to lay out his sinnes in their owne colours that so he may humble him and cast him downe but out of these three cases this dutie lieth vpon all man at all times to interpret euery thing in the better part so then the conclusion of this second dutie is this actions apparently good are to be commended doubtfull are to be construed in the best sense apparently euill are to be made no worse then they are but rather to be excused and let a man alwaies rather speake too well then too euill of another man amp rather speake better then worse then be deserues and rather iudge too mildlie and mercifully then too sharply for if a man be deceaued either waie that is the safer waie wherein to be deceiued thus to do is to performe that christian equitie which is here commanded and to maintaine peace which is the comfort of a christian life and thus much of the dutie the third dutie and degree of priuate equitie is in sundry cases to depart from a mans owne right that is to yeild oftentimes in such things wherein by lawe he might stand and oftentimes to forgoe such things which by law he might require without this equitie iustice and peace cannot stand christ our sauiour gaue a notable example hereof in paying toll math christ needed not to haue done it nor could any lawe haue compelled him to it yet because he would not trouble the publick peace nor giue them occasion of contention he yeilds from his right and paies them toll al christian man must learne by his example not to stand alwaies vpon their right if they will continue peace in the church of god it is not sufficient in christianitie nay it is a very wicked speach which we often heare man speake it is my right and therefore i will not loose it so might christ haue said and if you looke the place you shall find that he first of all argueth the case and concludes that he is free and not bound to paie and yet saith christ rather then i will offend them or giue them cause to thinck worse of me or my doctrine i will paie it euen so must a christan man in many cases go from his right and that for the maintenance of publick peace in the common wealth and of priuat peace one man with another for the maintenance of publick peace thus must man do in publick conferences as in parlaments and counsels and such like generall assemblies wherein the seuerall opinions of man are to be deliuered and thus must man doe in bonds forfeitures borrowing lending loosing finding buying selling in leases fines rents and all manner of bargaines and for the maintenance of priuate peace man must in their most priuate actions one yeild to another in such things wherein they might stand and oftentimes be contented to loose that hat is their owne and in conferences must a man oftentimes suffer himselfe to be crossed and ouerthwarted in that of which he is most certaine and to grant that to be which is not and that not to be which he knowes to be if the matter be of small moment and concerne not religion nor the state many such things must a christian man put vp daily at the hands of his brother for the maintenance of peace and loue amongst them this is a doctrine little knowne and lesse regarded in the world for its a generall opinion that a man may take his owne and may lawfully stand vpon his owne right which if it be ment generally in all cases is most false nay this is a commo speach of all man i demaund but my right and i will not loose my right and this is thought a reasonable speach and he is esteemed a good man who takes no more then his right for oftentimes man stand so strictly vpon their right that they go further then their right reacheth but this is a very carnall practise and controlled by the scripture and by the example of christ as we heard afore but if any man obiect that the example of christ is not to binde vs because he is the mediatour and therefore was to performe extraordinary obedience i then answer that not onely christ but other holy man haue practised this duty for he payeth toll not only for himselfe but for peter also and there is a notable example of this dutie in abraham who when his brother lot and his sheapheards could not agree was content to depart from his right for whereas he beeing the elder might haue chosen first he notwithstanding stands not vpon that but bids his brother lot choose whether he will and he will take what he leaueth a most equall christian brotherly part of that holy abraham whose faith is so much commended in the scriptures if we therefore will be called the children of abraham then must we be followers of him in his workes and namely in this we must oftentimes depart from our owne right in the practise of this dutie one caution onely must be remembred namely that we must distinguish of anothers right and our owne in thy owne right thou maiest yeild but when thou article to deale for another man thou must not yeild too much nor be too lauish of another mans right but this caution holdeth especially whe the cause is not ours but god or his churches for when it is such a trueth which directly concerneth the honour of god or the good of his church the must a man take heed he yeild not without warrant from god word for as it is equitie often to yeilde thy right so to yeilde in god causes is to betray the trueth if therefore thou maiest not giue another mans right fro him without his cosent much lesse maiest thou without warrant from god yeild any thing at all of his right from him this dutie therefore is to be performed in actions that concerne our selues and wherein the losse is not god or his churches but our own but it is lamentable to see many man howe lauish they are in giuing from god and care not how much they loose of his glorie but stand most strictly vpon their owne points and will not yeild one inch nor loose one foote of their owne right and from hence come so many suites in law and other brabling contentions in the world all which or many of them might be staied if man had but consciece to practise this christian equitie to yeild one to another in matters of their owne and of small moment amp it is certaine that if man in the world were not perswaded some by religion and conscience some by naturall reason and pollicie to practise this dutie it were not possible for the societie of man long to continue vpon the earth so much for the third degree the fourth and last degree of priuate equitie is to forbeare and to forgiue wrongs and iniuries done vnto vs in word or deed the scripture is plaine for this and so is naturall reason which teacheth that euery one that beares the name of a man should forgiue another because he beeing a man may deserue and stand in neede of the same himselfe and therefore is to doe as he would be done vnto but especially a christian man who lookes for forgiuenesse at god hand for his owne sinnes must needs forgiue his brother so that to a christian man there is a double bond or reason to tie him to this dutie one is as he is a man therefore must he forgiue him that offends him that so another man may also forgiue him when he offendeth for there is none but beeing a man and liuing amongest man he must needs offend another more forcible reason is as he is christian therefore must he forgiue because else how can he in reason demaund or praie for forgiuenesse at god hand for many thousand offences of his owne and those exceeding great when another man cannot obtaine forgiuenesse at his hands for a fewe small offences this dutie is of greater necessitie then all the former for vpon the practise of this depends the preseruation of peace but where this is not practised there is no religion no conscience nor saluation for where there is no forgiuing of another man that man is not forgiuen at god hands and he whose sinnes are not in christ forgiuen and taken away that man is in the state of damnation and till he be forgiuen he can neuer be saued but he can neuer be forgiuen till he forgiue his brother and so it is plaine that euen saluation it selfe in some sort depends vpon the practise of this dutie yet not as a cause but as a signe or an effect of saluation for this is not true that euery one who forgiues is forgiuen of god but this is true that whosoeuer is forgiuen of god will forgiue his brother so then neither in reason nor in religion can a man looke for forgiuenesse himselfe vnlesse he make conscience to forgiue another yes god hath made euery man a iudge in this case to condemne himselfe if he doe it not when he praieth euery day that god would forgiue him euen so as he doth forgiue others yet in this dutie of forgiuing outward iniuries two cautions are to be remembred that there is a time when a man is not to forbeare and suffer but may stand vpon his guard and defend himselfe from the iniurie and that is when his life is indangered as when a man is assaulted by a theife or by his deadly enemie who seekes his life and can haue no helpe he is in that case to helpe himselfe when he must either kill or be killed then reason and religion biddes him defend himselfe amp being in that case that a man cannot haue the magistrates helpe that beares the sword for his defence god puts for that time the sword into a mans owne hand and makes him a magistrate for that time and occasion for in cases of such extremitie god allowes euery man to be a magistrate not onely to defend himselfe but euen to kill his enemie if it be impossible any way els to saue his owne life and this defence of a mans selfe hinders not the dutie of forgiuing for so farre must a man forbeare and forgiue that he be sure to defend his owne life in the second place though a man forgiue the iniurie and wrong done vnto him yet may he safely in some cases goe to lawe for recompence of that wrong it is a deuilish opinion in the world that a man cannot goe to lawe and be in charitie we must knowe that a man may goe to law amp yet be in charitie for to forgiue the malice and to sue for recompence are things indifferent it is not so much charitie to forbeare the recompence as it is to forgiue the malice if therefore a man forgiue not the malice he is out of charitie but he may sue for satisfaction and be in charitie the scripture forbids not mens going to lawe but tels them how they should doe it lawe is not euill though contentious man and vnconscionable lawyer haue vilely abused it but it god ordinance and may lawefully be vsed so it be on this manner first it must not be for euery trifle euery trespas euery ill worde but in these cases a man is both to forgiue the malice and to remit the recompence because he is little or nothing at all hurt by it for example a poore man steales a little meat from thee in his hunger let the law take hould on him but pursue thou him no more for it then by the law thou needs must againe thy neighbours cattell doth trespasse thee thou must not go to lawe for it the malice be it more or lesse thou must forgiue in christianitie amp for conscience sake and the damage is so small as that therefore thou maist not go to lawe for it for the law is abused in beeing executed vpon trifles and those lawyer shame themselues and dishonour their profession who are willing that euery trespasse of sixpence damages be an accion in the law this is one of the causes of the base and vile names that are giuen to the lawe and lawyer in these daies because the law is imployed vpon sueh trifles and it is to be wished that the supreme magistrate would take order to restrain this generall evil that contentious man amp vnconscionable lawyer might not conspire together to pester the law with these trifles and though man be so vnconscionable as to run to the law for euery trespasse yet should lawyer be so conscionable and so wise as they should driue them from the law againe thirdly thy neighbour giues the ill woords raiseth or carrieth euill tales of thee equitie is not to go to law for euery euill woord but to consider that for the malice thou article to forgiue it and for the damage it cannot be great because many mens tongues are no slander neither article thou any thing worse for it especially when he dare not stand to that he hath said as for the most part they do not the second caution in going to law is that it must not be the first but the last meanes of peace law is a kind of warr as therefore warr is to be the last meanes of publick peace so should the law be the last meanes to be vsed for the attaining of priuat peace all meanes must be tried ere thou goe to lawe and if none will serue then is the law ordained for thee whereby to recouer thy right and to maintaine equitie for as to go to law for a trifle or at the first is extremitie and so iniury so to go to the lawe for a cause sufficient and after other meanes vsed in vaine is iustice and equitie and no extremitie here therefore let all christians learne how to go to law and the rather i do vrge this point because the law is notoriously abused and it is almost incredible what infinit sommes and masses of money are daily spent in it most vnnecessarily insomuch as the lawyer do exceed in welth any other sort or calling for man in this whole realme for reformation whereof let man but learne and practise the two former rules lawe is not ordained to be a iudge of euery trifle it is a shame to our lawe that man be suffered in the common wealth to arreast each other for debts of small value so as tenne times and otherwhiles twenty times as much is spent for the recouery of them as the principal is are not we a christian commonwealth why then haue we not the wisdome to appoint another an easier and a directer waie for the recouery of such debts and if there be no other way why doth not a christian man stay for it or loose it rather then goe to law for it it is a shame for our nation that there should be at one assises ouer england so many hundreth actions of trespasses wherein the dammage is little or nothing to reforme these is a worke worthie of a prince and euery man should put to his helping hand to it secondly let law be thy last remedie this rule controlls another foule misorder in our land man are sued when they would gladly compound when they would willingly satisfie by priuate order they are compelled to answer by law and yet there is a worse thing then this the law which should be the last is not onely made the first meanes but whereas it should be open and publike it is vsed as a close amp secret meanes it steales vpon man as the phrase is for man are sued afore they know and great charges come vpon them ere they are told of it by them that sue them is this equitie yes is it not rather extremitie and yet alas how commo is it in most places let therefore euery christian man remember his lesson here taught by the apostle let your equitie be knowne to all man but it seemes then will some say that man may not goe to lawe i answer thou maiest goe to lawe though not for trifles yet for things of waight as for the pursuit of a notorious theife to his due and iust triall for the title of thy lands for the recouerie of thy iust and due debts of value and of thy childs portion for the making straight of great accounts for the triall of thy good name when thou article so slaundered and by such as that thy credit is publikely indangered for these and such like causes thou maiest goe to law whe by other more easie meanes thou canst not procure a reasonable satisfaction for then it is unlawful to sue for the greatest cause in the world the trueth of all this doctrine doeth paul teach the corinths whome he reprooueth of three faults that they went to lawe before heathe iudges for euery cause they vsed no priuate meanes of satisfaction but ranne to the lawe at the first the first of these cannot be our sinne for we haue no heathen iudges in as much as our state and gouernment by the mercie of god is not heathenish but we haue a christian commonwealth but the other two are the generall sores of this land let vs therefore labour to heale them and to couer our shame let vs remember that not extremitie but equitie becomes a christian and let euery man take heed of this as he would be knowne to be a christian for the knowne badge of christianitie is mercifullnes the more mercifull the better christian for he hath tasted deeper of god mercies to himselfe and therefore he is mercifull to his brother and the worse christian the lesse mercifull for he neuer felt god mercies to himselfe therefore he cannot be mercifull to his brother now to go to law for euery trifle or to steale lawe vpon thy brother or to sue him before thou offer him peace it argueth a hard hart and vnmerciful and farr from this dutie of forgiuing but to be loath to go to lawe and to put it of as long as may be and first to giue warning and to offer peace and not to doe it but in matters of weight it argueth a mercifull heart and such a one as is readie to forgiue and such a one in whome the spirit of god doth dwell and thus i hope i haue opened this dutie of forgiuing and forbearing in such sort as a christian may see how to practise it with comfort to his conscience also without any great losse in this world or hurt to his estate and thus much for the foure seuerall duduties and degrees of priuate equitie now hauing opened the nature amp kinds of christian equitie let vs proceede further in the text let your equitie saith the apostle be knowne to all man the words import that it is our dutie not onely to knowe this vertue and the nature of it and to be able to talke of it but in all our affaires publike and priuate and in all our dealings with man so to put it in practise that man may see it and that it may be knowne to other man and that they may be able to auouch for vs that our dealing is vpright equall and indifferent ioyned with equitie and moderation and free from extremitie and oppression this is the meaning of that which we are here comanded by the apostle and the reason why the apostle vrgeth vs to make it known is because there is a priuie hypocrisie in our natures whereby we are giuen to make shew of more then is in vs against which vice we doe truely labour when we labour to make our vertues manifest and knowne to the world that so the tree may be knowne by his fruites he is a holy and religious man not who knoweth and can talke well but he whose religion and holinesse is knowne in the world and seene of man he is a mercifull man of whose mercie man doe taste so he is an equal amp vpright ma whose equitie is felt amp found by the who deale with him let therefore our actions with man testifie the vertues of our heart that me who liue with vs and deale with vs may be able to say for vs that we are possessed with those vertues for this is to be truly good not when a man can speake well or tell of his owne goodnes but when other man see it feele it and speake of it hitherto of the meaning of the words nowe that which was pauls exhortation to the philippians shall be mine to all true christians let your equitie be knowne to all man you haue learned what it is and howe it is to be practised it nowe remaines that we content not our selues with the bare knowledge but take notice of it as of a doctrine belonging to vs and put it in practise all our dealings publike and priuate yes and make it manifest to the consciences of all man good and bad so that euery man with whome we deale may taste and feele of our equitie and be able to testifie of vs that equitie beares rule in all our actions thus if we doe we are christians not in name and profession onely but in deed and truth and to perswade vs all to this holy duty let vs vse some fewe reasons to inforce it and amongst all the reasons that might be brought there is none better then this here vsed in the text the lord is at hand but before we come to speake of it let vs consider of one other which doth most naturally enforce this exhortation and it is this god sheweth most admirable equitie and moderation towards vs therefore ought we to shew it one towards another it is the reason of the holy ghost be yee mercifull as your heauenly father is mercifull wonderfull is the moderation that god sheweth to man amp it appears especially in foure things whereof two belong to all man and the other two concerne his church the first action of god wherein he sheweth great moderation towards all man is this a lawe was giuen to our first parents eate not of this tree if you doe you die for it and that a double death both of body and soule but they ate and so brake the lawe and thereby did vndergoe the penaltie annexed by force and vertue whereof they should haue died presently the death both of bodie and soule and this had beene no extremitie but iustice for this was due vnto them by the iustice of that lawe which was giuen them but nowe behold god equitie and moderation of the iustice of that lawe he strooke them not presently as the tenour of the lawe and their desert required neither with the first nor second death but deferres the full execution laying vpon them for the present a lesse punishment namely a subiection to the first death and a guiltinesse of the second that is of damnation beholde a marueilous mitigation by the tenour of that law their body and soules should both haue presently died and beene cast into hell but god in mercie suspends and deferres the execution of it and onely strikes adams body with mortalitie whereby he was subiect to the first death and his soule with guiltinesse whereby he was subiect to the second death by which mitigation it came to passe that as adam by his repentance afterward quite escaped the second death so he tasted not of the first death till nine hundred yeares after if a prisoner counts it a mercifull fauour of the prince or the iudge when after his iudgement to die he is repriued but one yeare then what a mercifull mitigation was this in god to repriue our first parents for so many hundred yeares this was the first action of god mercie to man and this concernes all mankinde generally but especially adam and eve but the second doeth more neerely concerne all man so soone as man commits any sinne euen then is he guiltie of eternall damnation because he hath broken the law for the curse of the lawe is not onely a guiltinesse but a subiection to the wrath of god presently to be inflicted vpon the sinne committed without any intermission so that so oft as a man sinneth so oft doth he deserue to be plunged soule and body into hel without beeing spared one houre if therefore the lord did cast ten thousand into hell in one houre he did but iustice for so the lawe requireth but see the mercifull moderation of the lord thogh we deserue euery houre to be cast into hell yet is euery houre and minute of our liues full of the mercie and moderation of the lord so as though our sinnes crie for damnation presently yet god staieth his hand and doeth not execute the sentence of damnation vpon the sinner instantly after his sinne no not in one of ten thousand but spareth euery man many yeares some more some lesse but all more then their sinnes deserue or the lawe requireth we often reade and alwaies finde that god heares the crie of sinners but we seldome reade that god heares the crie of sinne for if he alwaies heard it when sin cries for vengeance to him he should turne vs all into hell in one houre this is a wonderfull patience and moderation in god and yet behold a greater for whereas we by our sinnes doe euery houre plunge our selues into hell as a man that violently castes himselfe into a gaping gulfe see god wonderfull mercie we thrust our selues in and he puts vs backe he staieth vs with his own hand and so keepes vs out see what a sea of mercies the lord doth power vpon man for how can that but be an infinite sea of mercies which is shewed to so many thousands of man so many thousand times in one houre if his mercie did not moderate the extremitie of his lawe there should not be one man left vpon earth but all in one houre cast into hell but god staieth his iustice and staieth his lawe yes stayeth vs who our selues would execute the law vpon our selues and so cast our selues into hell hee keepes vs out and giues vnto vs a longer time to repent and this is true in all man to some he giues longer to some shorter but to euery one some where as the law giues not one houre to any man nay the law is so far from giuing time torepent that it admits no repentance at all no though a man should sinne but once and instantly after that one sinne humble himselfe in repentace and craue fogiuenes the law will not accept him to fauour nor yeild forgiuenes nor allowe his repentance for the law can do nothing but this either iustifie and reward him that fulfills it or condemne and punish him that breakes it further then this the law by it selfe goeth not it is the gospell which commandeth vs amp teacheth vs to beleeue and repent and to the gospell are we beholding for accepting our repentance which the law would neuer doe which indeede is so farre from accepting repentance as it neuer intendeth nor aimeth at repentance directly in it selfe and therefore in it selfe it is worthily called the ministerie of condemnation so then behold a most straight law and a most mercifull god so straight a law as if that mercy were not it would neuer giue vs one houre to repent in nor receiue vs to fauour though we repented presently but presently vpon our sinne cast vs into hell o therefore tast and see how good and gratious the lord is the law cannot haue his extremitie nor the deuill his will vpon vs who is the iayler of the law and is malitious though the law be iust and so by the extremitie of the iustice of the one amp the extremitie of the mallice of the other no man should liue one houre in the world were it not for the wonderfull mercie and mittigation of god who contrary to the course of the law both accepteth man when they repent and giues also time to repent and thus hath god done as in the beginning with adam so in all ages to the old world after many preachers sent and many hundred yeares patience and many thousands of sinnes ripe for vengeance yet god giues yeares more o how many millions of sinnes did they commit against him in that time and yet had they repented at the last they had beene saued but all was in vaine and therefore in the end god sent a flood and swept them all away euen so and more patiently hath god suffered vs in these latter daies but how comes it to passe then will some say that we haue not a flood as well as they surely because his mercie was great to them but wonderfull to vs we are as euill as they yes if we iudge aright and consider duely all circumstances our sinnes are farre more yes farre more hainous then theirs were so that we deserue a flood tenne times more then they did and if god dealt but iustly with vs where he brought one vpon them he should bring and hundred on vs and if iustice bare the sway she should vs sweepe away one generation after another with a continuall flood but marke the moderation of god more to vs then to them who deserue worse then they he gaue vs not an hundred and twentie but many hundreth yeares and brings no floods of iudgements but spares vs from yeare to yeare and from age to age that so we may either repent and escape hell or when our time is come drowne our selues in damnation and so be the principall cause of our owne destruction it may not vnfitly be noted in this place that sometime god may be said to cast a ma into hell and sometime man himselfe god throwes a man into hell when for some monstrous and contagious sinne he takes away a wicked man in the midst of his wickednesse by some suddaine iudgement and so sends him to hel but a man plungeth himselfe into hell when god giues him leaue to liue and libertie and time to repent but he continueth carelesly in his sinnes till he die and so casteth himselfe violently into damnation nowe such is the mercifull moderation of god that for one man whome he casts into hell as he did iudas presently vpon his sinne a hundred wicked man cast themselues into hell abusing that time and libertie which he gaue them to repent in and so bringing vpon themselues swift damnation let euery man therefore euery day of his life when he considereth the thousands of sinnes that are committed that day and seeth no flood of water fire nor brimstone to come vpon vs let him wonder at god mercie and say with the prophet it is the lord mercie that we are not consumed furthermore this moderation of god to all man hath another branch euery mans ill conscience is to him like the fire of hell and doubtlesse the torment of conscience is a part of the very reall torment of hell now if euery man had but iustice he should feele presently after euery sinne the very torment of hell namely the sting and torment of a guiltie accusing conscience but see the mercie amp moderation of god he inflicts it not presently but onely giues the sinner a pricke or a little pang as it were when he hath sinned but the raging furie of the conscience which is the greatest hell that is vpon earth he deferres till the houre of death or the day of iudgement when therefore thou hast done euill and feelest a pricke in thy conscience and a cheeke but no more remember that euen then if god did not moderate his iustice thou shouldest feele the extreame horrour of thy conscience which would ouerwhelm thee as a burden which is to heauie for thee to beare thus then we see the marueilous mercy of god wicked man are his sworne enemy for sinne is that which offends him aboue all things in the world yet so great is his mercy and so large is his moderation that euen his enemy tast of it euery day and houre thus much of god equitie and moderation to all man now secondly this moderate amp mild dealing of the lord is more speciall to his church and children and that also shewes it selfe in two actios first of al iustice requireth that euery ma should pay his debt amp comon reason tells vs that words amp promises cannot passe for paiment but due debt must be satisfied now euery christian man is in a great debt to god that debt is obedience to his lawe for christ came to saue vs from the rigour of the lawe not to free vs from obedience to it but how doe we pay that debt euen as he doth who oweth ten thousand pounds and craueth to pay it by a penny a yeare for so we owing perfect obedience in thought word and deed and also puritie of nature the root of all we i meane the best amp holiest me of all haue nothing to teder to god but a fewe good desires and grones of the heart and a seely poore endeauour all which is vnto that which the law requireth like vnto one penny to ten thousand pound yet behold the mercie of god and his compassion to his children these our desires and that our indeauour comming from the truth of our hearts doth he accept for perfect payment and that man who hath an heart fearing god and a care and desire to please god in all things and in his place and calling endeuoureth it accordingly is the man whome god loues and embraceth in the armes of his mercie though he be far fro that which in debt and dutie he oweth to god thus doth god testifie of himselfe in malachie i will spare you euen as a father spareth his owne son that serueth him now wee knowe there is no sparing nor forbearance like vnto that a father bids his little son do this or that which is farre aboue his strength the child not cosidering the difficultie but looking only at his dutie and desiring not only to please his father goeth about it and doth his best and yet when all is done he can do nothing to it at all now the father reioyceth in this willing obedience of his son and approoueth in his child the will and indeauour though he cannot doe the thing he bids him euen so doeth the lord spare his children he commaundeth vs to keepe his lawe and it is no more then out dutie which notwithstanding of our selues we can doe no more then a little child is able to carrie a milstone yet if we willingly goe when god commaunds vs and doe our indeauour and all we can and grone vnder the burden and desire to doe more this our desire and indeauour proceeding from faith amp from a son like willingnesse doth the lord accept for the perfect deede this is no small moderation but great and wonderfull for whereas we owe perfect obedience and he might iustly challenge it and for want of it make vs pay it with soule and all he is is cotent to take a will a desire and indeauour which is all we can and is in effect nothing at all in this world that man would be extolled for his mercie who will take of his debter a penny a weeke who oweth him pound or that takes all he can pay and accepts his good minde for the rest oh then howe mercifull is our god who for so great offences and so huge a debt as ours is to his maiestie is content to accept of our indeauour and heartie desire the heart amp tongue of man cannot sufficiently magnifie so great a mercie thus much for the first againe the mercie and moderation of god towards his children appeares thus there is not the best man but he sinneth amp there is not a sinne so little but in iustice it deserueth a whole world of punishments yes all those curses denounced in the lawe euen all those plagues threatned deut all which in iustice should ouerwhelme him presse him downe amp crush him to nothing but behould the mercifull moderation of god he is content to lay no more crosses on his children then by his owne grace which he also giues them they shall be able to vndergoe and in the end to ouercome also when his children sinne as when do they not doth he punish them according to the proportion of their sinne no for then all the curses of his lawe should be heaped on them for one sinn and if he did so he did but iustice nay he deales so with them as it is not to be called a punishment at all but rather a chastisement for a punishment must be in some sort proportionable to the offence but that which he laieth on his children is nothing at all to their sinne and therfore it is no punishment properly but as it were the chastisement or correction of a father to teach his son his dutie and to reforme him and bring him home from his euill waies and therefore not in the rigour of a iudge but in the loue and wisdome of a father he first considereth what we are able to beare and then laieth no more on vs then we may well beare and which is most wonderfull of all he giues vs strength to beare them to this ende speakes the apostle to the corinthians corinthian there hath no temptation taken you but that which befalls the nature of man wherby he imports thus much that there are temptations and crosses in god iustice due for sinne and which he hath in store readie at his pleasure which are so great so heauie and so fearefull as the nature of man could not possibly beare them but should sinke vnder them and perish as did cain and iudas and such like amongst these an euill conscience is one which is so intollerable as the wise man saith prou a wounded spirit who can beare it but the crosses he laieth on his children are alwaies such as they beare with comfort for a time and at last with ioy doe ouercome them a notable example hereof we haue in salomon of whome god saith to dauid if he sinne i will chastise him with the rod of man as if he shold haue said i could in my iustice for salomons great sinnes beate him with scorpions and bring him to nothing by my heauie hand but i will consider he is my child and but a man therefore will i lay vpon him no more then the nature of man is able to beare as god dealt with his son salomon so this is god voice to all his sonnes vnto all my church and children will i vse such lenitie and moderation and in my chastising of them i will so abate the rigour of my iustice that by my hand and rodde they shall not be pressed downe but rather raised vp in new obedience and learne thereby to feare and loue me more then before this should euery christian man seriously consider of and thinke with himselfe how much this bindes a man to deale moderately with his brother when the lord deales so moderately with him thou sinnest amp god chastiseth thee most mildly and laieth not on thee the thousad part of these crosses which in iustice he might doe shall the lord deale thus moderately with thee for thy many and so great sinnes and wilt thou deale so hardly with thy brother in his fewe and small offences against thee remember therefore in thy dealing with thy brother this dealing of god with thee and certainely thou canst not forget the one if thou hast tasted of the other shew thy selfe therefore that thou hast beene partaker of god fauour and that thou hast felt in thy soule the sweetnesse of his mercies by beeing milde amp mercifull to thy brother out of that great sea of mercies which god lets flowe ouer thee all thy life long let fall some droppes of mercie on thy brother and remembring how god deales with thee deale not thou with thy brother alwaies so hardly nor so straitly as thou maiest or he deserues let these foure mercifull actions of god towards thee be foure strong bonds to tie thee to the obedience of this dutie to be milde and mercifull to thy brother remembring euery day how moderately god deales with thee and howe farre from that extremitie which thou deseruest and to mooue vs hereunto let euery man be well assured that the more he hath tasted of god mercie the more shall man taste of his mercie and the more sinnes that a man hath forgiuen him at god hands the more will he remit and forgiue in his brother and the more he feeles in his owne soule god loue and mercie to him and the more neere he is to god by his faith and repentance the more carefull will he be to deale gently with his brother and the reasons hereof are these first god forgiueth not a man his faults but vpon condition that he shall forgiue his brother god is not mercifull to a man but vpon codition he shall be so to all man with whome he deales secondly the mercie of god to vs in forgiuing our sinnes is not made knowne to the world by any meanes more then this when a man is not hard and extreame but equall and mercifull in his dealing with man whereupon therefore it followeth that the further a man is from god and the lesse that he hath felt of god loue to him the lesse moderation will he performe to his brother let euery man then be ashamed by these his extreame courses with his brother to make it known to the world that he is an impenitent sinner himselfe vnreconciled to god and his sinnes vnpardoned and let no man thinke he shall escape that censure if he be an vnmercifull man for certainely it is imprinted in mens dealings whether they be in god fauour and their sinnes are pardoned or no let therefore euery man when his owne crooked nature or the deuill makes him boyle against his brother in anger and vrgeth him to vse him hardly and extreamely consider with himselfe and say i liue vnder god i am more in god hand then this man in mine i haue offended god more then he me and if i had my desert i had now beene in hell for my sinnes but yet i liue and by his mercie i am spared and am here still but hath god spared me that i should pinch others hath he beene mercifull to me that i should be cruell to others surely therefore i will be mercifull and moderate to my brother more then they deserue least god take his mercy from me and then what shall become of me but to be throwne suddainly into hell which i deserued long agoe nay i will by my equitie and moderation towards my brother mooue the lord to be still more mercifull to me without which his mercie i cannot liue one day in the world hitherto of the exhortation of the apostle and of the great moderation of god to man now followeth the apostles reason the lord is at hand these wordes beare two senses or meanings the first of the last iudgement the second of god presence the first is thus framed if the holy ghost meant of the last iudgement be you equall and moderate one towardes an other for god is readie in his great and generall iudgment to iudge all man and then happie is he that findes not iustice but tasts of mercie and who shall tast of mercie then but he that shewed mercie in this world but if secondly the holy ghost meant of god presence then is the argument framed thus god is present with euery man and at euery action to testifie and iudge of it and either to approoue it and reward it if it be vpright equall and mercifull or to correct and punish it if it be extreame and void of equitie therefore let your equitie be knovvne to all man both senses are good but we will cleaue vnto the latter it is then all one as if the holy ghost had said vse equitie and moderation in your dealings and remember who is at your elbow stands by and lookes on readie to iudge you for it surely there can be no better reason then this if it be setled in a mans heart for a theefe or a cut purse if he saw the iudge stad at his elbow and looked vpon him he would not doe euill he would stay his hand euen because he seeth that the iudge seeth him who can presently hang him a strong reason with man and it keepes euen bad man from leud practises consider therefore when the iudge of iudges the lord of heauen and earth stands by and seeth and markes all thy actions whether they be towards thy brother as his is towards thee this ought to make the greatest man on earth feare how he deales cruelly or hardly with his brother but worldly man will not be perswaded of this but when they are laying their plots to deceiue their brother and when by iniustice and extremitie they pinch and wring him they thinke in their hearts god seeth them not nor doe they euer thinke of god but labour that god may be out of all their thoughts this is the cause of all sinne in the world for thence is it that mens hearts are hardned and that they care not how extremely they deale with man because they thinke god seeth them not nor wil cal them to account for it and doe with them as they haue done with their brother hence comes all iniustice crueltie extremitie suits in law for trifles taking forfaitures of leases and of bonds and taking all aduantages hence comes it that one man will not spare an other one day nor forgiue one fault nor passe by any infirmitie nor put vp the least iniurie nor yeelde one inch from his right but if his brother offend neuer so liule vpon neuer so apparent weaknes he shall heare of it on both sides as they say and if he deserue ill he shall haue his deserts to the full thus hearts are hardened affections are immoderate bowells of compassion are shut vp loue and pitie are banished and in their roomes raigne crueltie and iniustice moderation dwells in corners but extremitie is that which beares sway ouer all the world what is the cause of all this surely first because man are vnsanctified and haue not repented of their sinnes amp so they feele not that god is moderate and mercifull to them secondly they perswade not themselues that god seeth them therefore against this blasphemous thought the roote of all euill and cause of all sinne arme thy selfe with this reason of the apostle and resolue of it that this is the eternall trueth of god and shall stand for euer the lord is at hand and seeth and obserueth thee amp all thy doings therefore as thou wilt escape his mightie and fearefull hand season thy doings and dealings with moderation and if thou hadst noo cscience nor no mercie in thee yet be mercifull remebring who seeth thee and deale moderately and equally in the sight and presence of so moderate so milde and so mercifull a god so mercifull a rewarder of him that deales moderately and so powerfull a reuenger of him that deales hardly and extreamely with his brother let vs then ende with the apostle as we began let your equitie and moderation be knowne to all man for god is at hand and thus much out of god word of publike and priuate equitie wherein i haue not spoken all i might but giuen occasion to others to enter into further consideration thereof
